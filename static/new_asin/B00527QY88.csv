4527018,4,B00527QY88,"Presented as 3 two-part stories, Season 3 deviates from the strictly historical. But it was still entertaining overall, and Rupert is still a great lead.",1356393600,,153,5.16
4527019,5,B00527QY88,"This has the all hallmarks of an excellent British series:  Well written, well acted, first class production values.  I have really enjoyed all the episodes so far in this series.  The characters are interesting and very likeable.  I found myself really caring for them all.  The actors have certainly made the most of their roles, creating memorable characters.  The stories are intricately plotted, with plenty of twists and turns.  Am looking forward to more from this series..",1356307200,,480,5.1558441558441555
4527020,5,B00527QY88,"Viewers who saw the first two installments of Whitechapel will appreciate that there is a significant change in format this time round. Whereas the first two series were three part stories based on Jack the Ripper and The Kray Twins respectively, this time round we have three two part stories. Additionally these investigations are based much more loosely on historical crimes than the first two series. I imagine this is because the Ripper and the Krays are the only two major criminal activities in the Whitechapel area of London which most viewers will be familiar with.

It is easy to see why this change has come about. Whitechapel was probably intended as a one off, but following its resounding success there was a lot of pressure to come up with a follow up. What we got was a farfetched tale involving clones of the Krays which stretched credibility to extremes. The powers that be clearly appreciated that this time the format had to move on. The result actually works rather well. The historical crimes are still real - you can google the Ratcliff Highway Murders , the Thames Torso Murders or the various masked murderer crimes mentioned on the show, and get the details. The fact that the crimes being investigated are more loosely based on these events makes for a much more realistic story line as opposed to the straight copycat replication of the earlier series.

I thought that the three stories each worked although my personal favorite was the last of the three which was dark and shocking with a substantial sting in the tail. It certainly makes for good if not compulsive TV viewing. One thing I do not think is necessary though is for parts of the filming to be in the semi dark. I presume this is to conjure up visions of the atmospheric Whitechapel of the 1800s, but personally I thought it was unnecessary and did not add anything apart from straining the eyes. However, again Rupert Penry-Jones and Philip Davis put up a convincing performance as DI Chandler and DS Miles, and in the background is Edward Buchan, played by Steve Pemberton, the Ripper and Kray expert, whose knowledge clearly extends to other crimes of the Victorian era as he beavers away in the archives.

I do hope we get more of Whitechapel, and in its new format I imagine there is much more scope to produce additional episodes. I would think the only limitation is if they feel they have to keep seeking out gruesome real life crimes to base it all on, but I really do not see why they should not make up a few of their own if they are struggling!",1341792000,71,2548,4.632743362831858
4527031,4,B00527QY88,It is a good show overall. But it is a way too dark for my taste and very hard to watch. It is unnecessary dark I would say. It would not loose anything if it was not as dark and would be much more enjoyable.,1493596800,,208,3.6444444444444444
4527032,5,B00527QY88,"The third season of ""Whitechapel"" continues this decidedly dark and stylish British detective drama from BBC America, with its depiction of a series of gruesome new murders in the East London district of Whitechapel. As is the case with most BBC America programming, ""Whitechapel"" is intelligent, intriguing, and suspenseful. The writing, the sets, and the acting are all superb. In addition, the complicated relationship between the inexperienced command detective, and his hardened veteran investigators, makes for an interesting dynamic for the viewers of this excellent series. ""Whitechapel, Season 2"" is an outstanding BBC America detective procedural, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1491609600,2,727,5.803738317757009
4527033,4,B00527QY88,"Brilliant acting, great photography, but I must say the incredibly overwrought Season 2 left me exhausted. The Kray thing went on too long and was so implausible it made my head spin. I am hoping Seasons 3  and 4 are easier to swallow.",1489363200,,235,4.465116279069767
4527034,4,B00527QY88,"Great show, unique. Fantastic performances, especially the two lead detectives (head DI and his sergeant). It's a bit too violent for my tastes, so I knocked it from 5 stars to 4 because I felt a lot of the violence and gruesome scenes were unnecessary. Occasionally the stories got goofy, but were quickly pulled back by a good twist at the end of each episode. The single biggest drawback was the gaping loophole involving the head DI's mental health. CLEARLY he was un-fit for duty - even though he was a good detective - but not once do you see him seeking help for his problem, nor does his staff ever once suggest that he should be seeking help. It was disturbing to watch him un-ravel in episode after episode, and also never find happiness from his loneliness and lack of intimacy. I just feel the writers made him TOO dark.",1488672000,3,832,4.516556291390729

I enjoy the history element and I wished that they had more. I didn't much care for trying to get a love interest for DCI Chandler. Some people just can't connect on a romantic level and prefer to be alone because humans are complex and sometimes irrational.

4527117,4,B00527QY88,"I thought season 1 was quite interesting with Jack the Ripper's crime being copied in the 21st century. Season 2 continued with a modern day crime being based on an older case. I thought that was a bit far-fetched. However, now that I'm in season 3 and, again, a current day crime is being modeled after an old case I'm just enjoying the show.

4527213,4,B00527QY88,"Whitechapel Series 3 originally aired on ITV in 2012 and features three mysteries spread over six episodes. The series emphasis on the grotesque, punctuated by quick, cross-cut gore continues, as does the tendency of our detectives to rummage around at night, when they cant see anything, for atmosphere. DI Joseph Chandlers fastidiousness and inability to cope with the physical aspects of crime scenes is growing. Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones) is strangely socially inept for a tall, handsome man who dresses well. DS Ray Miles (Phil Davis), formerly a thorn in Chandlers side, is now his protector. Ripperologist Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) works in an official capacity. DC Megan Riley (Hannah Walters) is a welcome addition to the team as a female officer who is neither glamorous, disposable, nor there to make a point.

DC Riley seems like a real person, in contrast to the series fanciful plots and theatrical main protagonists. I wasn't impressed by the first two series of Whitechapel, but these goofy characters and their incredible cases become almost lovable after a while. The series still suffers from over-the-top atmospherics and characters who are two-dimensional and completely out of place in a police force. But, if youve gotten this far in the series, you either like its flaw or have gotten used to them. The shows writers ask too much of the audience, when they expect us to accept characters inability to cope and their lack of social skills as compelling points of character developmenton top of everything else. I sometimes wonder what the show would be like if it focused on the more believable supporting officers DC Kent, DC Mansell, DC Riley instead.

The mysteries are:

Before The Murder in the Darkness, DI Chandler proposes that the team might learn to be better detectives by studying history. To this end, Chandler employs Ripperologist Edward Buchan as a police researcher, setting him loose on the archives in the basement of the police station. Meanwhile, a mass murder occurs at the shop of Ben Salter, an upscale tailor. Four men were killed by hammer blows, while their colleague Georgie Fox (Stephanie Leonidas) was out on an errand. The killer evaded a state-of-the-art alarm system and left no signs of forced entry. Buchan discovers that the case recalls that of the Ratcliff Highway murders in 1811. An obvious suspect is Marcus Salter (David Schneider), the elusive, angry half-brother of Ben, who suffers from photophobia. Meanwhile, Miles encourages Joe in his flirtation with forensics investigator Lizzie Pepper (Christina Chong).

While the detectives attend the christening of Miles new baby, a fox runs through London and drops a human arm in the street in The Hunger for Mercy. The arm is that of a young Caucasian woman, severed from her body by an axe after death, a death by the poison Spanish Fly. DI Chandler and the team stalk wild foxes in hopes they will lead to the source of the body parts. They lead to a run-down house belonging to a formerly fashionable photographer and his model wife, Jack and Adelina Grace (Barbara Marten), where they find a human foot buried in the garden. Buchan, meanwhile, finds parallels in the Thames Torso Murders of 1887-1889 and the case of the first known American serial killer, H.H. Holmes, who operated in Chicago of the 1890s. When a wrapped torso turns up downriver in Richmond, DI Mina Norroy (Camilla Power) joins the investigation.

The Sins of Betrayal opens as teenaged babysitter Sasha Lowood (Ria Zmitrowicz) is murdered with her own cell phone, her 8-year-old charge Evie Pixley (Emily Sanderson) the only witness. Police are doubtful when Evie describes the assailant as a man clad in black with black mask and sack thrown over his shoulder, a picture of the boogeyman of legend. But when psychologist Morgan Lamb (Lydia Leonard) is attacked in a parking garage and survives to describe the same assailant, DI Chandler and DS Miles suspect a spree killer. They fear it is recently escaped criminal psychiatric patient Calvin Mantis, who killed his family and blamed the lost 1927 silent film London After Midnight for his inspiration. Meanwhile, Buchan investigates historical spree killings and has trouble coping with the consequences of his being slow to discover the historical clues in his last case.",1481328000,,4324,5.075949367088608

Then, just when the connection between the murders; the old lady always hanging around causing strife and anxiety amongst the team; and the weird things going on in the police station were getting really good, then, bam, no more show.

Doesn't glorify criminals; yet adds questions of whether one can learn from past deeds in order to widen one's outlook for modern-day criminals.  Extremely topical stories seen from the camera lens of the old British detective stories. Love the perspective of the universally flawed good guys striving to overcome and eradicate evil and mitigate harm.

There seems simply no limit to the dark and salacious history of Whitechapel, and so the writers have plenty to draw upon. It's not always entirely clear how the 19th-century cases relate to and help in the investigations of the ones in the show, but I still love the idea. Equally importantly, the characters have depth and originality, warmth and an element of romance, in addition to the humorous personage of the researcher--a show that delves into history and subject matter this dark simply must have these elements of humanness and comedy, which other shows so often try and fail to provide.",1469318400,,738,4.912

I guess that's a selling point with the British audience but it doesn't do anything for me, an American.  It's interesting to glimpse how snobby and ""class"" conscious the British still are.  Because we (Americans) are sooo not into class, right? (read irony here please)  Anyway it gets a bit socially claustrophobic to me to always be in the confines of Oxford.

The rapid fire flashes scenes (visions) had a bit too much edge, for the pace and always felt hacked in. Plus in previous episodes there was not much validity given to paranormal influences, that all the crimes were explainable. But in the last few episodes of season three, they did suggest there was. I get it, I guess; but still, it was a let down that the producers took the easy way out on indicating the visions DI Chandler had been experiencing, were legitimate premonitions (the note from the psychic).",1468627200,,587,4.653846153846154

I know bad ratings killed this show, but it was building up a lot of subplots that worked, similar to CSI or Bones, including the lead character's issues with psychics, the evil/not evil guy with the twin sister, and so on.

Plus, the show was getting away from repeating history and switching to learning from it - you can only have so many serial killers duplicating past crimes. This offered a new outlook on crime, seeing human behaviors repeat over time. I liked that.

And, of course, you can't beat British acting. Even those in minor roles have more talent than most actors on American television.",1467763200,,825,4.636986301369863

4527723,5,B00527QY88,"This is the most riviting detective series on Amazon. The main character Detective Chandler arrives as a political appointee, upperclass, sissy to head a grizzled cop unit in London's most seedy precinct. Everybody hates him a first sight. He orders them to wear ties and keep their desks tidy. As the series progresses Chandler, as well as the other characters mature and their relationships become more intertwined.. The series begins with a copycat murder of the most famous Whitechapel crime of all times--Jack the Ripper. Chandler brings on a ""Ripologist,"" an expert on Jack the Ripper, a theatrical buffoon. Bit by bit he wins some grudging respect.. The series does not degenerate into cliche do to the suberb writing, acting, and especially the cinematography. If you are a fan of Nordic Noire you may also like this series. Although the atmosphere of Whitechapel is as different as you can get from the Swedish genre it shares some of the same characteristics. An emphasis on cinematography and sound track creates an atmosphere as intriguing as it is eerie.",1467504000,2,1067,5.033898305084746

But this third season went off the rails and the twist at the very end was less a twist and more a violation of trust. WHY? I think some of these British crime dramas become a test of morbid endurance. I love the dark and sombre shows whether it be Prime Suspect or Luther or Hinterland or Wallander, but without redemption there's no point for me. And Whitechapel's characters gave you the the necessary transcendence above the evil- and yet, this season just tried to shock me one too many times and by the end I was pissed. Do the writers of these crime shows have no real imagination. I mean that in EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD - REAL IMAGINATION.",1466985600,,872,4.422360248447205

4527895,5,B00527QY88,"""Whitechapel"" is very scary and full-speed noir, even in the daytime scenes. No home is safe. Every street is vacant. Every house and building in the East End is dark, and most of them are in ruins with shadows, echos, unexplained sounds, and plenty of tortured corpses. The plot segments become, as in all series, somewhat predictableBuchan with his grinding study of the history of murder, Chandler with his chronic OCD personality and failed love life, Miles (Tony Davis's Smallweed in ""Bleak House,"" ""Shake me up, Judy"") with his cranky, anti-intellectual, yet savvy mind. These people are always interesting, and we're always rooting for them to win even a small victory over the brutalities of the desolate dank, urban world. The editing and cinematography are BRILLIANT. Check out the rapid, scritchy, spidery inserts in the story of Driscoll the carpenter.",1464825600,2,864,5.178571428571429

4527999,4,B00527QY88,"My wife and I like this show, although it is quite dark in terms of topic area. I think it is well written and acted and as BBC fans, we love seeing actors we recognize from other BBC shows. My only negative comment is that the characters are a little ""too much"" of what their character represents, but I understand the writers are making a point but a little over stereotypical at times.

There is a wonderful quiet tension throughout the show which kept me hooked for all 3 seasons (or ""series"" as they say in the UK).  The back stories of the characters were compelling.  Adored Rupert Penry-Jones in MI-5 and even more so in Whitechapel.  Penry-Jones' characters are so tightly wound - a joy to watch.",1463788800,,468,4.8734177215189876

Season 2 folds in the more recent Krays who have a legend all their own. They even had the Monty Python treatment so became almost characatures of themselves eventually. But they were nasty buggers and the show did that aspect justice.
Season 3 is just a bit too weird for my tastes but it was still watchable and made for gripping television.

It reminds me a lot of Wire in the Blood, my all time favorite series of this genre, except it has a slightly lighter mood to it. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely dark and disturbing, with that awesome British crime story dark humor (or should I say humor?) that I really enjoy. Watch the pilot for season 1, if that doesn't catch your attention, don't bother with the rest.",1463097600,,431,4.468354430379747

Season 3, which contained more than three episodes, as were the other 2 seasons was done well, but we felt that the basic story line was more than a tad weary at this point.",1463097600,,438,4.407407407407407

The homicide team is a very interesting group, and it's a nice change for those familiar with Brit television to have Phil Davis as a genuinely nice guy.

4528372,5,B00527QY88,"I'll write a single review for all four seasons of this series.  An unusual and quirky crime drama staring Rupert Penry-Jones and Phil Davis it is set in the London area of Whitechapel, scene of the late 19th century serial killer Jack the Ripper.  The two main characters solve crimes with the help of history and forensic science, both of which appear accurate and interesting in and of themselves.  The plots skilfully blend dark drama and humor and the acting is the best of the British art (Phil Davis is one of my favorites!).  My only regret is that a series five was cancelled by ITV.",1461542400,6,592,4.556603773584905

4528382,5,B00527QY88,The only thing wrong with this series is the fact that it was cancelled by the BBC.  I LOVED this show and the characters therein.  It is fast paced with just the right amount of hints of the supernatural to be very interesting.  The actors are top notch in their performances.  The dash of humor here and there in the shows is just right not to take away from the suspense.  I have nothing negative to say about this show and highly recommend it.

The premise of the story is that criminal behavior repeats itself, so the DCI at the Whitechapel Police Department enlists the help of a criminal enthusiast who helped him solve a case with a Jack the Ripper like subject, the enthusiast being an expert on the Ripper.

After a new crime wave comes about with a different modus operandi, the DCI once again works with the criminal enthusiast. Eventually he decides that he is valuable enough that he should be part of the team. Thus begins the new recruit cataloging every known major crime from centuries past via the method(s) used to commit the crime. He uses this information when he sees crimes start to take on a pattern to predict how they will evolve and who may be victimized next.

I love the concept behind the show as well as the show itself. Like I said earlier. I hope this series will continue for a long time to come. It is thoroughly interesting and enjoyable.",1424649600,2,1154,4.538461538461538

4528553,4,B00527QY88,Each season in this show gets better.  There is a slightly strange and creepy atmosphere in many of the scenes and overall the photography is dark.  Just for once I wish they would explore a crime scene in a well lit place instead of a derelict place with no electricity where they have to use torches (flashlights).  Gradually there has been a development of each character but you have to watch each season to be aware of this.  Overall a good police procedure series with a different and slightly scary twist.,1418169600,,512,4.593406593406593

4528557,3,B00527QY88,i enjoyed the first two seasons less because of the plots than the interplay of characters. I especially like the relationship between the Chandler and Miles characters.

Characters more fully developed; the flaws of the main character more fully portrayed, the relationships between several main characters more fully developed.  More of a role for the ""historian"" of crime, whose character is rounded out a bit more.  Don't look for criminal investigative realism; there probably aren't as many copy-cat killers in all of England as there seem to be in the confines of the East End, but if you can forget the deja vu from other episodes, even as those chapters indulge in deja vu for their plots, you'll enjoy the series. They did not go for the easy out at the end of the final episode, for which, kudos.",1417910400,,673,4.743589743589744

4528569,4,B00527QY88,"A good continuation of this gritty, sometimes grisly series.  The writers wisely got away from the strictly copy-cat criminal plots of the first two seasons.  Instead the patterns of criminal behavior in historical crimes are applied to help arrive at the identity of the current criminal.  As in previous seasons, the interpersonal dynamic between the members of the police team is just as interesting as the investigations.  The actors' performances are top-notch.  It's disappointing that the final season of this series is unavailable to stream.

4528683,5,B00527QY88,"While house sitting a few weeks ago I discovered Whitechapel; as I said it was quite the most wonderful surprise. The series focuses on the crimes committed in London's Whitechapel district; led by DI Joseph Chandler (Played by Rupert Penry-Jones) who struggles w/ OCD, which @ times helps and hinders his ability to solve cases. His team, street wise and in the beginning unwilling to work or eat according to the rules set down by their new DI, come to appreciate the eccentricities of their boss. As the season and series progress, the Writers, Ben Court, Caroline Ip and Steve Pemberton peel away a bit more of the characters personalities to reveal a bit of dark humor shared by DI Joseph Chandler's team. I've watched Series 1-3; as this is all Amazon is offering @ the time, there is a fourth series which was originally broadcast on the network in September 2013. This series held my attention straight away, I spent the weekend watching everything offered by Amazon; I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good British drama, I do not think you will be disappointed. In my opinion the only drawback is that series 4 has yet to be made available for streaming.",1410652800,,1177,4.746341463414634

4528702,2,B00527QY88,"I liked the first two series. On occasion, I like gripping mysteries and intense emotion, and the ""flashback historical"" aspect to these is an interesting twist. The characters were intriguing, interesting. With the 3rd series, however, the show became unnecessarily graphically violent. The show slipped from mystery to horror, and not the somewhat farcical horror of classic horror movies. I stopped watching in the middle of Episode 2. Much of the recording has visually dark overtones --- dark walls, deep shadows, too many night scenes. Little relief, and little time to develop characters or plot, as we skip from one /set/ of bashed in skulls to another. I didn't come here looking for ""Colombo"", though I enjoyed those in their time. But surely there is enough real graphic violence available in various fiction and non-fiction media streams, so that we can skip that in our ""entertainment"" and focus on plot and character.",1409788800,,931,5.131578947368421

4528774,4,B00527QY88,"I hadn't seen Season 1 and having seen Season 2, I was...trepidatious about Season 3. Season 2 was sort of weird to me. I felt like the characters were acting out in a weird way. They had their particular quirks and personalities, no doubt. But, there were moments that almost frustrated me because I felt like they were acting irrational--beyond the particular psychology of their characters.

Season 3 really reset everything for me. First, instead of several long episodes all covering the same case which may have been too much of a stretch for Season 2, this season consists of three separate cases broken into two parts each. Each case, as usual, has a historical analog--something that's integrated more into the storyline as Edward Buchan joins the team officially as an archivist.

I won't go into detail about any of the cases, why spoil the fun? You still get the plots centered on Whitechapel and as I said, they all have a historical analogue which is a nice twist.

The season ends with some serious devastation and I think all in all this season is the best so far. While you could skip the previous seasons to some extent, you'd lose a good deal of character development. I'd suggest trying them out regardless. I came into it in Season 2 and was able to get a handle of things (though bear in mind my wife watched Season 1 so she was able to fill me in).

I know they did another season after 3 but I don't know when they'll have it up here on Amazon yet. I'm looking forward to it.",1406592000,6,1499,4.5

4528813,5,B00527QY88,"One of the best thrillers ever seen on TV or the big screen. Each of the actors played their parts very well and very convincingly. Season 3 with its 3 stories were excellent. I was on the edge of my seat during all 6 episodes. Season 4 is not on Amazon just yet, but it was shown on the BBC at one time during 2013. I will be pleased once it is released for viewing.

The friendship seen between Miles and Chandler is well written and acted. Every character is handled perfectly to give us a flavor of how a team of detectives arrives at a solution in a case. One can imagine the stress and pain and camaraderie in such a team of detectives on a major police force. London is the perfect location for such a group to live and work and deal with the crimes of a huge melting pot of different cultures. This program has been beautifully filmed, taking advantage of the history of London and how we view the various crimes committed over the centuries in this wonderfully mysterious city.

Spoiler Alert:

If you have not read about it, this excellent program was not renewed for a Season/Series 5. That is a shame and one which will surely go down as a huge mistake for ITV and the BBC. With its excellent production and acting talent, this series will be heralded in the future as one of the best ever produced. I am sure something new will be seen at some point in time on the BBC, as the British seem to have a special talent of the highest order for producing excellent stories, whether they be thrillers or mysteries. However, I am always puzzled as to why wonderful series are cancelled when they are at the top of their form and not struggling to produce new stories. I understand the actors and writers may want to move onto something new, and it is always desirable to go out while you're on top, but it is not what us fans like to see.

4528819,3,B00527QY88,"Great acting. Well done. Just a bit too gruesome and scary for me to really like it. More of a thriller than a mystery. And not much levity to counter balance the darkness.

Wonderful, wonderful show.",1403049600,,328,5.0

4528833,5,B00527QY88,"I have watched all three seasons and have greatly enjoyed every one of them. All the characters are engaging, with  Rupert Penry Jones, the obsessive-compulsive DI Chandler and Phil Davis as the hardened DS Miles as the stand-outs. Very, very fine acting on both of their parts, with Jones showing a constant struggle to control his OCD and Davis feeling very put upon in having to babysit a crack pot. Both have developed their characters into flesh and blood people with genuine cares and hurts. They've been able to do this with the help of some very well written scripts and fleshed out with the additional team members and so forth. I highly recommend this series to any who enjoy great stories and great actors.",1402185600,,717,4.736
4528834,4,B00527QY88,I enjoyed this season.  It was not quite as good as the first season but that might only be because the show has progressed from the first season where everything was new.,1402099200,,171,4.34375
4528835,5,B00527QY88,White chapel is another in the line of great British detective series. It is suspenseful and well developed. The three main characters are well developed and have their own strange habits which add to this drama. This is a must watch series.,1402099200,,241,4.761904761904762
4528836,4,B00527QY88,Good police procedural with a couple nice twists:  1) parallel between current crime and historic crime 2) lead character coping with OCD and not in a humorous way.,1401926400,,164,4.857142857142857

4528850,5,B00527QY88,"Whitechapel is an excellent ""who dunnit"".  Having the lead character have OCD makes it even more interesting. Philip Davis, as side kick, is superb as always.

4528853,5,B00527QY88,Much improved on season 2. Getting used to the little detectives now. When I was a kid living in England you had to be a certain height to join the police force they must have changed the rules or Rupert makes them all look small!

Like the historical elements in helping solve the crimes.  The characters feel real - you can forget you are watching a show.  There is some humor.  Enjoyed seeing our OCD detective on a date with a messy girl.  Priceless.

The first couple of season were very small so this one is an odd escape of that, but they didn't skimp on the plot or dialogue.  It ended up being just as much fun, even though it was a good bit harder on the heart.",1399852800,,352,4.2388059701492535

4528878,5,B00527QY88,"In season 3 the show has managed to stretch it's legs. Now that they are not investigating copy-cat crimes it feels that everyone has loosened up a bit. The relationship between DI Chandler and DS Miles has developed beautifully and feels quite unforced. The rest of the team have all had time to let us get to know them. In short a very positive season especially the last episode, I defy anyone not to feel a little emotional over that one.",1399507200,,442,4.469135802469136

I also like the vulnerabities that crop up during times of stress. I love that the actors have a normal variance in appearance. United States shows seem to use cookie cutter sameness. So tiresome.",1399420800,,331,4.928571428571429

4528887,4,B00527QY88,"Again, adult television, not for children. Enjoyed the ensemble cast; good group - did have some good surprises.

4528894,4,B00527QY88,"Gritty & well acted. I like the relationships between the characters.  Rather a lot of gore, but it's a murder investigation drama so that is to be expected.  Did not find the gore to be distracting, but as necessary for story development. Def not a show for kids 13&below else nightmares will come.  I liked the entire series.  Rupert is also nice eye candy!",1398297600,,359,4.5625
4528895,5,B00527QY88,I loved this series and was sorry that more weren't available.

4528896,4,B00527QY88,"The writing, acting, dialogue, sets: all excellent. Characters were allowed to develop distinct personalities, which is always enjoyable. The rapport between DI Chandler and DS Miles seemed realistic in it's growth.
What threw me off the third season was [spoiler alert] the death of Morgan. I call this the 'Bonanza' trope: in the TV show Bonanza, any woman who became engaged to or actually married to one of the Bonanza men was slated for death or disgrace.  Women treated as throw away objects of shock or as inspiration for revenge. I really felt this was a cheap shock ending for an otherwise well-written episode.",1398211200,,620,4.961538461538462

4528899,4,B00527QY88,"Brilliant Brit murder series.  If you like history, this one is for you.  Contemporary, well written murder mysteries interwoven with Whitechapel history, which informs and influences the solutions.

4528901,3,B00527QY88,"I reviewed the first season very positively. However, as I continue to watch, the stories have not only an ongoing gruesomeness, but also a repeating story line of having a sure fire suspect, who is later exonerated through an unexpected (less so as time goes on) twist. The actual solution is still not readily apparent, but you know that the twist will occur. Also, the main character's obsessive compulsive disorder is getting a little worn. It seems as if most police shows these days, American or foreign, necessarily have a  complex main character who is beset by some tortured past. That's OK to a point, but a little normalcy should not be totally forbidden.",1397779200,,666,4.842105263157895

4528903,5,B00527QY88,"This is without a doubt one of the best crime/supernatural/cop shows I have ever seen. This is everything the X-Files was in the beginning before it started to suck. The characters are all compelling, the plot twists, the dialogue, all first rate. It;s a shame they stopped at 3 seasons, but then again, if making it longer would have affected the quality then maybe they were smart to go out on top. See these while you still can on Prime. You will not be disappointed.",1397779200,,470,4.541176470588235

4528911,5,B00527QY88,It was a perfect mix of characters.  Loved the brilliance of the character played by Rupert Penry-Jones as well as his need to attain perfection.  The crotchy 'second-in-command' added a nice balance.,1397174400,,200,5.21875

4528918,5,B00527QY88,"It's interesting to watch about criminal, mystery crime, something like that. The reason I like at most is that they don't swear a lot; they have different opinions over the crime scenes. I like actor that was DI Chandler who had OCD (Obsessed Compulsive Disorder) demands to have a clean office all the time. I admit I really like to watch British TV shows (Crime shows).",1396915200,,372,4.651515151515151

A ""little"" romance ""seems"" a really good thing, but we shouldn't be too surprised by the season ending.  The Brits know how to take care of loose ends.

4528923,5,B00527QY88,"You must watch this in order (start with Season 1) to fully appreciate the relationships developed with all of the characters.  I still cannot get used to the blood & gore but it definitely adds to the overall production.

4528927,5,B00527QY88,I particularly enjoy this British series for the absorbing stories and  the interesting and unusual characters who serve in the police unit central to the series. The solutions to the crimes are often unexpected which is especially welcome to someone who likes this genre.,1396396800,,272,5.181818181818182

4528929,4,B00527QY88,"Truly enjoy this quirky crime drama.  Excellent characters.  A refreshing change from the, what has become over done, same old, same old American crime shows.

4528936,5,B00527QY88,"I really liked this show, it is too bad that they have cancelled it. The mix of old unsolved or solved crimes as a way to avoid repeating mistakes, just goes along with those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. So it was a very novel way of looking at things.",1395792000,,267,4.056603773584905

4528945,1,B00527QY88,"The Whitechapel series has excellent actors and is artfully crafted.  I rate it 5-stars for casting, directing, acting, special effects, and cinematography.  So, what is my gripe?  My gripe is the contrived, shallow, manipulative plots that ruined the series for my wife and me.  This series pummels one who exercises a willing suspension of disbelief, normally a pleasurable device when watching fiction, into the hard reality that he or she has been taken for a sucker.  Who is writing these screenplays?  Did they earn their chops playing mindless video games?  Are they sadomasochists who cannot conceive of healthy relationships? Is there some rule of the trade that demands a customer must never get a break?  What would be so bad about letting characters learn from their mistakes or achieve happy outcomes?  Must every episode depend on depravity, torture, insanity, betrayal, death, and despair?  What is wrong with occasionally allowing a prime suspect to be the real culprit?  Would it anger some fearsome god of thespians if a sympathetic, OCD-plagued protagonist were to gain release from his psychological torments and find happiness in a beautiful, sensitive woman who is his intelligent equal?

Ah, well.  I suppose a writer would have to know about happier, healthier existences to write some of them into a script.",1395619200,2,1332,5.197183098591549

4528959,5,B00527QY88,"Perfectly-tuned Rupert Penry-Jones, full throttle Phil Davis and the point/counterpoint socially-textured cast provide another extended season of Whitechapel. If you are new to the series from ITV, *please* treat yourself to the first two seasons before launching into this one. The quietly layered and self-referencing English characters and storyline line deserve your understanding. Think Downton. ;)

I know, I know I could purchase the DVD, but I am quite spoiled by the wonderful bonus of TV and Movie streaming available through Amazon.  OK, I like this series well enough that I may very well purchase all three seasons and share the DVD with family and friends.  It is a great way to support, promote and encourage more great products.

As far as season three, it is a heart breaker for DI Chandler.  He really needs a female in his life.  Miles needs sleep and Ed needs a shrink...a new one that is.

4528996,5,B00527QY88,"I enjoyed all of the episodes, however, I was surprised and delighted  when the Rupert Penny-Jones character visually displayed warmth, happiness and dare I call it ""awe"" after (1) experiencing the kiss. (2) and his joyful reaction to the baby at the shower.  (What happened when he saw the vomit on his suit-coat?)  The writers have gotten me believing he  is so ready to explore his ""human, feelings"" side. Yes, he now looks vulnerable - to me - in a strong way..  He has evolved beautifully.  The final joy I would want for him is to build a relationship with the right person.

4529000,3,B00527QY88,"I wandered across this series looking for other BBC mystery stuff and watched the 3 seasons available on Prime.  This is OK for some generally greusome English detective stories, but not as polished and comfortable as Morse or the Lewis series. Certainly not as good as the three Sherlock seasons.  Still worth watching as a change of pace from other similar shows.",1392940800,,365,4.870967741935484

4529002,4,B00527QY88,"But no laughing matters here. I don't watch American cop shows or serial killer/kidnapper series, but I stumbled onto Whitechapel and while it's darker than anything I want to watch and the crime scenes bloody and gory, I actually have to screen away when I hear the musical cue that disturbing images are coming, I am hooked on seeing if the lead detective can continue in his position with all his neuroses.  Especially since there are criminals everywhere.",1392940800,,459,4.884615384615385
4529003,4,B00527QY88,"It's a cross between a Sherlock Holmes style murder mystery/investigative cop show, horror story. (Not too crazy, but just crazy enough). We're hooked. If you like Sherlock I think you'd like this one too.",1392854400,,205,5.0588235294117645
4529004,5,B00527QY88,I just love the atmosphere and the main characters seem very believable.  The stories are also very interesting.  I understand that there will be no season 4.  Hope Amazon gets more British cop shows-I love them,1392854400,,211,4.805555555555555
4529005,5,B00527QY88,"I've only viewed the first episode of this season,but have watched the complete2 seasons previous to it. If this episode is any indication,this should be just as good a season as the last two have been. While the premise of the first season might be redundant in succeeding storylines,for this show it works. This is an addendum to this review:I did finish the rest of this season(3)of Whitechapel finally,and I call it a combination of the C.S.I.,Law and Order,and Criminal minds franchises of series'.This is well done,gritty crime genre at it's frightening best. Whitechapel itself conjures up images of The Ripper,so a series set there about similarly ghoulish crimes in modern days,would still be just as hard-hitting spooky and creepy. Really well done.",1392854400,,759,5.178861788617886
4529006,3,B00527QY88,"The acting is excellent. The twist and turns and suspense of finding the perpetrator is compelling as they use a behavioral technique using old, sometimes decades older crimes. The problem is everything is dark. The basement work area for the researcher is too dark. Most crime scenes are too dark and sometimes bizarre.

The problem for me is it seems the screenwriter and director seem to be placing unnecessary manic, sinister, and sometimes demonic scenes inserted to make their criminal too dark and may be working out childhood fears or their own propensity toward criminal behavior. The crime is bad enough but demonic and bizarre special effects are just not needed.  I would certainly never allow someone in my family, who is sensitive, watch this series.  It seems that other series such as Prime Suspect, Vera, and Inspection Lewis are just as compelling without the over-the-top antics placed in this series.",1392768000,,920,5.079470198675497

4529009,5,B00527QY88,"There are three things that make detective shows enjoyable -- complex lead characters, interesting or puzzling mysteries to resolve, and a coherent narrative arc -- and this series has all three. The characters have individuality and personality, the combination of current crimes and historical insights works well and is a fresh way to treat the crime genre, and the stories have a good flow -- no blindingly obvious clues or sudden out-of-the-blue conclusions. The characters evolve and grow over time as they interact and influence each other. The killings are shown primarily through the examination of the crime scene, which makes the viewer more involved in trying to figure out what happened and cuts down on gratuitous violence. The production values are also good -- atmospheric shots, tightly edited, and it has a good soundtrack that conveys the tension without being overwhelming. Overall, very satisfying.",1392681600,,919,5.344827586206897
4529010,5,B00527QY88,"The always-excellent Phil Davis (check him out as a bad guy on ""Sherlock"") leads the cast in this modern day whodunit. It may be a bit derivative of Sherlock's visual tricks, but good writing, excellent directing and very good acting make this show a must-watch for any detective show lover.",1392681600,,291,4.84

4529012,5,B00527QY88,"It may be a modification to the old Lay's commercial but it is true with Whitechapel. It is another stellar BBC detective drama that grabs a hold of you and you must watch the entire story.

Season three is set up differently and Seasons 1 & 2. Each case is two 45 minute episodes. Seasons 1 & 2 consists of 3 episodes that are an hour and a half long. However, do not jump into season 3 without watching 1 & 2 as parts the story line and characters build upon the previous.

My wife's comment after each episode is, ""boy, that was good!""

Enjoy.",1392681600,,546,4.180952380952381
4529013,5,B00527QY88,I absolutely loved this series. I consumed all four seasons in one week! I actually had to track the four season down as Amazon does not offer it yet. I thought the acting was superb and DI Chandler is my new favorite cop. The chemistry between DI Chandler and DS Miles was top notch and I couldn't wait to see what Miles would say next. I thought Chandler's OCD was nicely done as I know first hand the symptoms of the disease. I would have loved to see more of this series but unfortunately it was cancelled last November 2013. I guess all the good series are gone.,1392595200,,567,4.2592592592592595
4529014,4,B00527QY88,"Really like the mystery, but sometimes find the constant connection to historical past murders as a ""crutch"" that makes it hard to keep the focus on the current  story.  It usually dovetails nicely in the end, but in the middle, it can be cumbersome.  Overall, enjoy watching; altho like most police-involved mysteries, there are too many scenes done totally with flashlights.",1392508800,,376,5.131147540983607

4529021,5,B00527QY88,Rupert Penry Jones is heavenly.  The whole cast is gold. I really wish it didn't end. At first you're uneasy because it looks boring and bland but the relationship between each character with one another has you hanging on to the end. Definitely glad they have 6 episodes(3 two part ones) more suspense definitely...murderers still never seem to live. I kinda like that.,1392422400,,370,4.873015873015873

4529024,4,B00527QY88,I enjoyed the previous 2 seasons but season 3 is a compillation of 3 different stories done in 2 episodes each .  The ending is one you would never expect and leaves you wondering what will season 4 bring to the fore.  Enjoyed Whiechapel and is better than average crime drama series.,1392249600,,284,4.4423076923076925

4529051,4,B00527QY88,This is a great new twist on serial killer dramas. Detectives with Scotland Yard use information and lore from historical serial killer events to help them solve modern serial killer murders. The team of detectives is lead by a young and enthusiastic supervisor who is helped along the way by an experienced veteran detective sergeant.  The team is also helped by a historical researcher who ties the m.o. of the present killer to the m.o. of past killers. The actors are extremely good and the chemistry between the actors makes this a great series for fans of this genre.,1391472000,,573,4.787878787878788

The chief character, played by Penry-Jones, is charmingly flawed. He has a whole raft of quirks, including being OCD, but he is bright, a quick learner, and loyal to the officers working under him. The murders are gruesome and reminiscent of murders from the past. The setting is the Whitechapel area of London, apparently a scruffy and rough section. I liked the characters and their development, the bizarre crimes, and, of course, the locales throughout London. I'm only sorry that there are no more seasons in this series.",1391040000,,679,4.904347826086957

It is very well acted. The main character, DC Chandler - aside from looking amazing - is so likeable, almost innocent even, but complex and imperfect. The story lines are interesting and entertaining, but are a bit dark and a little graphic. Yet it never comes across as gratuitous.

I've started with Season 3, but I'm pacing myself because this seems to be the end of the series. I hope I'm wrong, but that's all there is on amazon.",1390780800,,629,4.233333333333333

4529084,5,B00527QY88,"Season 3 is the darkest and creepiest of Whitechapel. There is less of the idea of copycat murders and more gleaning motives and learning from crimes of the past to solve present day murders. The unusual filming angles and quick, blink-of-an eye flashes of the gruesome murders builds the viewer's tension. The murder squad is a strangely loyal and dysfunctional family. DI Chandler's OCD is not handled in a comical manner like Monk. His reaction to the mounting stress by changing into clean shirts and performing other repetitive actions during investigations adds to the tension. (Side note: British cops need to carry guns. The sheer audacity or stupidity of trying to apprehend serial killers without a weapons is mind blowing. At the very least, they should have a cricket bat in hand.)",1390348800,,793,5.015151515151516
4529085,5,B00527QY88,"The characters and stories aren't at all stereotypical or predictable. Long time fan of Law & Order (and it's various incarnations), but was ready for a break, for something a little different and I'm happy I tried this.

I like the balance of ""this episode's story"" and the overarching character development. Reminds me of reading a book in a series where if you only read the book (the story) you can enjoy it, but if you like the main characters enough to return and pick up the next one, you get a bit of a bonus.

The first two seasons are 3 episodes each, but they tell one story in those 3 episodes. No point watching 1 if you don't want 2 and 3. Season 3 has 6 episodes, but now they've broken it up into 2 episodes for each story. I like not trying to force a story into 1 episode.

Negatives: Probably one more minute of blood and guts than needed, and I can't decide if some of the camera work between scenes is artistic or overdone.",1390176000,,944,4.262569832402234
4529086,3,B00527QY88,"I was really impressed by the first season of Whitechapel, and it set the stage for the series as a whole.  There was an erudition to it, as it touched on the namesake district's most famous series of murders while following modern detectives.  Further, it established Whitechapel as a fine character-driven police drama.

The second season was, in my opinion, even better.  This time the antagonists were brothers purported to be the second coming of the Krays.  Further, there was an extra element of menace, not just from the London underworld, but now from policemen corrupted by it.

With all this in mind, I had really high expectations of Season 3.  This one is as long as the first two combined, with six episodes addressing three cases.  If anything, the characters were more interesting, especially the interaction between DI Joe Chandler and Sergeant Ray Miles.  Ed Buchan, the civilian researcher and ""Ripperologist,"" also finds his place.

However, this is all undercut by the three cases of the series.  While interesting, none are as compelling as those echoing the historical Jack the Ripper or Krays.  It seems that the writers reached a little far, and instead of grasping something with the cachet of those characters and their crimes, come up with those are on the bad side of silly.",1390176000,,1303,4.926605504587156

4529120,4,B00527QY88,"Whitechapel is an interesting police series.  I almost liken it to Criminal Minds meets Prime Suspect, with a little bit of Sherlock thrown into the mix.  The first two series focused on the pursuit of Copycats famous to the Whitechapel district of London, with series 1 being a Jack the Ripper copycat and series 2 focusing on the successors of the Kray brothers, who were notorious English mobsters.  While both series had their charm, it's not until series 3 where the show starts to come into its own.  In series 3, we get away from copycat killings and into more original territory.  Though the mysteries are based on real crimes from history, they each have their own unique twist to them.  Not to mention the fact that the crimes are so obscure, its unlikely the viewer will actually know the history behind them.

This is the first season where Whitechapel becomes more of a show as opposed to a miniseries.  We get a bit more in-depth with the characters, including Chandler's struggle with OCD - which explains why he gets so involved in his cases even to the detriment of his ""fast tracked"" career.  We also see the relationship between Chandler and his grizzled Sergeant, Miles, blossom into a genuine (albeit turbulent) friendship.  The crime team expands to include a host of new characters, not the least of which is Buchan, who is hired as an official consultant and record keeper.  He has some nice subplots where we get to see the obsessive Ripperologist and amateur sleuth practically overdose on Crime History in the records basement, and how he comes to terms with his new role as an ""official"" investigator.  Plus, we get numerous romantic subplots with Chandler, and it's entertaining to watch him struggle harder with pretty ladies than he does with cold-blooded killers.  (Ah, British Angst... what would TV be without you?)

As with all Whitechapel bad guys, the ones in this series border on the paranormal and are very spooky.  The killers here often seem more suited to the X-Files than a cop show, at least until it's revealed how they do what they do.  In series 3, we have a ""vampire,"" a man who can ""walk through walls"", a creepy hoarder, and my favorite - the Boogeyman.  This brings much more variety to the series than the previous two seasons which were focused on a single bad guy.  But in each instance, the killers end up being spooky, intelligent, and formidable foes.

The mysteries in Whitechapel are ""whodunits,"" so as a viewer, you're trying to figure out who the culprit is along with the police.  The show does a pretty good job keeping you guessing as to which suspect is the right one, up until the reveal at the end.  The fact that the viewer isn't aware of who the culprit is can make the ""supernatural"" elements of the show genuinely creepy until the explanation of how the killer actually worked is shown.  In that sense, it's a bit of a throw back to the good ol' Scooby-Doo mysteries, where everything is creepy and scary until Old Man Winters gets his mask removed and we discover everything was done with smoke, mirrors, and pullies.  Viewers who enjoy trying to figure out a mystery will probably enjoy series 3 more than the previous two.  In series 1, the killer isn't really on the police radar until the very end.  In series 2, the bad guys are revealed very early on.  So with this series, we're treated to 3 2-part episodes where we get plenty of good clues as to who the bad guy is.  Also, the criminals are very intelligent in this show, so it is a genuine cat-and-mouse game that we're along for the ride with, and its extremely enjoyable.

I'd definitely recommend this show to anyone interested in a good crime drama.  I'd also recommend that they watch the first two series before getting to this one, simply so they can see the evolution of the characters up to this point and know the history behind the Whitechapel squad (Sargent Miles speech at the beginning of series 2 is a must-see).  However, series 3 is such that you don't really NEED to watch the first two in order to enjoy it.  It stands on its own pretty well.  But I think being up-to-date on the previous two series definitely makes watching it better.

Overall:  A solid 4 stars.",1389139200,,4216,4.629878869448183

4529131,5,B00527QY88,"The Whitechapel series was excellent, if gory, so not for the squeamish. The acting was superb, Rupert Penry Jones very quirky and interesting and the cockney coppers have it down pat. The evil characters couldn't be more scary. Don't watch it alone. I hope they do a follow up series. Probably based loosely on facts gleaned from British police archives.",1389052800,,355,4.933333333333334
4529132,4,B00527QY88,Great story telling. Quirkiness if OCD adds to the interest.  Would like a bit more development of the minor characters.  Hope more seasons are produced.,1389052800,,153,5.08
4529133,5,B00527QY88,Great character development with an interesting story.  Characters seem real as opposed to Hollywood types.  Actors seem to be chosen for their talent.  Can't wait until season 4 is released.,1388966400,,191,5.3
4529134,5,B00527QY88,"I admit that I enjoyed the first season of Whitechapel, and thought it was a nice touch giving the Jack the Ripper a copycat update. after season two, which was also enjoyable, the Krays also got a modern retelling. By season 3, I was curious and slightly concerned that the writers would run out of ""modernizing famous old crimes"". i was pleasantly surprised to see that they changed direction slightly and came up with 6 original episodes containing 3 tales lasting 2 episodes each. Each story was not based on actual events, but rather pulls from various crimes and MOs of past criminals. What could have been a disaster, actually turned out to be the strongest season I've watched so far. The writers and cinematographers should be commended for coming up with some creepy and interesting plots and atmosphere. I was sad to read that ITV canceled it after season 4, but at least it gives me 6 more episodes to watch when (hopefully) they're released on Amazon prime. I highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys darker, crime thrillers or wants a change of pace from the norm.",1388966400,,1085,4.71578947368421

We are consistently  amazed how UK crime series are so well done (i.e., character development, gratuitous violence, car chases, shoot outs, etc.).

4529145,4,B00527QY88,"If you loved Season one and two then your probably already watching Season three. The plots are still intriguing, the directing original and the writing top notch, my only disappointment was that the characters began to stray from their original types. Penry-Jones is so neurotic it's hard to believe that he was once considered for the fast track, and the star researcher has lost his charming eccentricity that first endeared him to his audience. All the same, it's still pure entertainment and the viewer won't be disappointed.",1388793600,,530,5.103448275862069
4529146,5,B00527QY88,"Another excellent crime drama from the UK. This is the 3r4 season. The stories are different from the first two seasons. The first two season didn't have as many episodes but followed one story. This season there are 3  two episode stories. If you liked Inspector Lewis, Life on Mars, Ripper Street or New Tricks, I believe you will enjoy this series also.

4529174,4,B00527QY88,"These stories are a really dense tapestry of clues, ideas, and protagonist 'angst.'  I can understand why it only lasted three seasons: by the end of the third, the central characters 'neurasthenia' is a little more than you want to carry, and his partner's solid regularity can no longer offset his neuroticism.  It was great at the beginning, but his descent into OCD hell was unnecessary--I did wonder if he helped usher in the era of the totally bonkers detective/CIA agent.",1387670400,,478,4.888888888888889

4529179,3,B00527QY88,"I enjoyed finally seeing the third season of Whitechapel. As with the first two seasons, it had many good twists and turns and an excellent cast that worked well together.  The implied violence is brutal, not glamorized.  Although false leads are typical for a crime drama, I though some of the imagery, such as the shadowy figure that appears to be crawling on the ceiling, a bit too false.  I understood that it represented people's imaginations getting the better of them, but I believe it gave a supernatural overtone that I did not like.  None the less, I can't wait to see the next season.",1387238400,,595,4.6380952380952385

He has to lead a team of old school, rough and ragged detectives who are clearly led by and loyal to Sgt. Ray Miles.  A small man with a loud voice who is not in the least afraid to voice his opinion - which usually is the exact opposite of his new boss.  Whitechapel has been beset with copy cat killers who are taking very old (true) crimes and recreating them to the tiniest detail and it is the job of Chandler and his team to uncover the killer.

Rather than try to stuff a story into a box containing ""x"" number of minutes, they seem let the story play out as long as needed to allow for character and plot development with a substantial presentation.

4529210,4,B00527QY88,"As the name suggests, this series is dark, but offers a good detective/murder series set in current times.  Whitechapel is the area where Jack The Ripper ""worked"".",1384646400,,163,5.037037037037037
4529211,4,B00527QY88,Really interesting. I liked seeing the characters change their relationship over time just like I saw when I was in the work place. The cases were definitely not the run of the mill and they did get a little freaky but I couldn't stop watching.,1384560000,,244,4.444444444444445
4529212,3,B00527QY88,"The charactors are developing nicely, but the gimmick is starting to be strained.  It is still a nicely done murder/mystery/police dectetive series and I will watch more as it comes out.",1384387200,,186,5.0

4529217,5,B00527QY88,A very entertaining show. Well written and acted. I especially liked the compulsive Captain. His inability to relate to others on an intimate level was brilliantly portrayed by the actor. I also liked the character of the archivist.,1384041600,,232,5.131578947368421

The stories are grim, even gruesome, all of them framed by the gristly history of the Whitechapel area, famously the haunt of Jack the Ripper.  The third season, unlike the first two which were complete story arcs in a few episodes, contains three separate stories of murder and mayhem.  The cast is outstanding, and one of the draws, for me at least, is watching these characters interact and evolve.

If you love British crime drama, good mysteries, or just good drama, you should take a peek at Whitechapel.",1383436800,,707,4.85

The plot was generally excellent, but toward the end I felt they were running out of ideas. It appears this will be all there is, which is somewhat regreattable, but if the plot material dioesn't exist, I feel the ending is very well done and the closure is excellent.",1383091200,,370,4.707692307692308
4529226,5,B00527QY88,"Rupert Penry- Jones is amazing as DI Chandler,  and Phil  Davis is believable as his sergeant who begrudgingly gives him the respect he's due as Chandler begins to prove his mettle. I love how their relationship grows by the end of this season.  As  well, the story lines in this BBC  production are fun and intelligent, if far fetched.  Worth every minute of viewing!",1383091200,,368,4.671875

4529232,4,B00527QY88,Enjoyed the mix of characters.  OCD is something we all share but those who get a double dose make for interesting learning.  The actors and the FX techs make it believable.,1382832000,,173,4.548387096774194

Pilot has an interesting Jack the Ripper in present times... Intro to all the major characters, and good story to boot. Pilot might be available it Amazon, but I couldn't find it there at the time I looked... Hope there are more epidsodes coming...",1382659200,,426,5.0

4529239,5,B00527QY88,"I stumbled across season 1 of Whitechaple some time ago and was sucked in right away. Seasons 2 and 3 have not disappointed, either! Fantastic character development, subtle, deeply moving acting and great writing. This is really some of Britain's best television, hands down.",1382313600,,275,5.2727272727272725
4529240,5,B00527QY88,"Initially, I thought the DI and the story lines in Whitechapel a little too quirky for my tastes.  But, I stuck with it and I got over that by about the third episode.  The quirky DI character really grew on me as well as the team who works with him.  Just finished the last of episode available on Amazon Prime (it made me laugh and cry) and hoping a fourth season will be available soon.  Highly recommended.",1382054400,,410,4.285714285714286

4529243,4,B00527QY88,this show very much!  :)  I like how it tries to tie in old cases with new to see if any conclusions can be made.,1381708800,,113,3.48

4529245,4,B00527QY88,Interesting show for any Yanks who are Anglophiles at heart. The Jck the Ripper storyline results in the boss becoming a real copper.,1381708800,,133,4.826086956521739
4529246,5,B00527QY88,"The format has changed a bit from one big mystery to three two-part mysteries.  There is more character development, especially of the two main characters.  I'm looking forward to season 4!",1381449600,,189,5.064516129032258
4529247,5,B00527QY88,"Loved it. Hopefully more episodes to follow. I was fascinated by the historical tie-ins.  Also all the political moves by ""The Suits"". Nothing changes does it?",1381449600,,159,5.115384615384615
4529248,3,B00527QY88,"The show started off with a good premise, but I became slowly irritated with police procedure and it overshadowed my enjoyment of the show.  How do you attempt yo apprehend a suspect, as was the case many times, with not even a flashlight or some sort of defense skills?  These are individuals who have committed heinous crimes and you think they will allow you to apprehend them with a please, and would you like a cup of tea-duh!

The storylines were good, but the writers should have focused on practicality and reasonableness, which all of the episodes in one way or another don't speak to.",1381449600,,594,4.6380952380952385

4529253,5,B00527QY88,Another great season for this highly enjoyable crime drama. Superbly flawed but likable characters and wonderfully creepy serial murders make this one of my favorites!  One more great vehicle for Phil Davis!,1380844800,,207,5.46875
4529254,5,B00527QY88,A bit gory and scary but good story.  Great photography which enhances the experience.  Reflective of the old Whitechapel area of London where the story takes place.  A well done series.  Superbly crafted and photographed with very good acting.  Some of the dialogue was lost to me due to English idioms and sayings but the story comes thru sufficiently to draw me back for more.  I look forward to viewing the whole series again.,1380844800,,430,4.743243243243243
4529255,5,B00527QY88,I love Rupert Penery-Jones character. The relationships between he and his DS is a good part of the show. Mysteries are  spell binding. Hope to see more of these guys.,1380844800,,167,4.566666666666666

4529257,5,B00527QY88,Absolutely love this series.  Kinda reminds me a little of Monk but a little more serious.  The cast works well together and I love the relationship Rupert Jones has with his sergeant and his crew.  I hope it gets renewed over and over.

4529268,5,B00527QY88,"I rated Season 2 with five stars because I personally enjoy the characters on this police procedural/historical crime show, but actually Season 3 is better than Season 2.  It changes format so that each story is two episodes long, and that improves the plots because there is not enough meat in historical crime for another six-episode copycat killer story set in Whitechapel.  I love stories about the East End and I also like the characters created.  For escapist television watching this is perfect.",1379808000,,502,5.024096385542169

4529270,5,B00527QY88,"Yay for more episodes! I love the new format, but appreciate how they don't solve a case in one episode. Unlike US, shows there is a definite gray area to shows from the UK. You don't know who's good and who's bad right off the bat. Everyone has layers and even if there is hope, it doesn't mean things will end happily-ever-after. All that being said, it's great tv. It gives you enough to make you feel invested in the lives of the detectives and even the victims. I highly recommend!",1379548800,,486,4.351648351648351

4529272,5,B00527QY88,"I wasn't sure how they were going to extend the premise of this show, but they managed it.  By turning it into a lesson on how human nature has not changed over the span of history, and how it manifests itself not only in the crime, but in how the crime is investigated and what mistakes are made, has kept the series interesting and relevant.  I was happy to hear that another series of this show will be starting in Sept. 2013 and I can't wait for it to hit our side of the pond.  As expected, the British have the genre of the mystery nailed down and the production quality, acting and scripts are excellent.",1379548800,,611,4.25

When Series 4 started I watched the first episode but noticed right away there were references I didn't understand because I had not seen Series 3 (I probably would not have noticed this if I had not seen Series 1 & 2 and been so familiar with the characters) so the hunt began again.  When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled.  Then I started looking here for my other British favorites and so many of them are available I knew it was time to go Prime.  Between Amazon & Netflix I have lots of watching/catching up to do.  Whitechapel is my current favorite and an outstanding series, I highly recommend a watch for anyone who likes a good mystery/police drama that explores the dynamics of people as well.  One caution, it is British so those who have trouble understanding the accent may need to watch more than once to catch everything (you are going to want to see this one again anyway).",1379548800,,1039,4.352331606217617

4529322,2,B00527QY88,Interesting characters and acting was good but for me the violence was too graphic.  Most BBC mysteries are good and I like them because they focus on solving the crime not on showing us the violence that led to the crime.,1376784000,,222,4.414634146341464
4529323,5,B00527QY88,"I've watched all 3 seasons now of 'Whitechapel' (Amazon instant video) and to my mind they are as interesting and watchable as the BBC's new take on 'Sherlock' (another great story-driven, character-rich series). I think Seasons 1 and 3 were my favorites - I found the 2nd one a little less entertaining but I'm not prepared to take off a star for that as season 3 more than made up for it. OCD Joe, hard as nails (but soft inside) Miles, the eccentric and interesting Buchan along with the rest of the cast make a wonderful show that will entertain and enthrall you.",1376697600,,567,4.514563106796117

That's probably weird to say when it's about murder and serial killers but the team dynamic really sealed it for me. I like that the third series moved away from straight copycats and I LOVE the way Chandler and Miles play off one another. Not to mention the funniness brought in by other detectives like Mansell and Riley. It really is a great show and combines many of my favorite things: police procedural, creep factor, serial killers, camaraderie. Good times!",1376611200,,598,4.759615384615385

4529330,3,B00527QY88,"While I enjoy this series to an extent, it tends to get hackneyed.  Just how many copycat murders of historical crimes are going to happen within one police district?  The premise of applying evidence from historical crimes to modern ones works well for the first murderer in the series-- who is copying Jack the Ripper.  But to continue to do exactly that with every contemporary murder that happens is a shaky foundation at best, often unbelievable-- even to someone willing to 'suspend belief' for the sake of entertainment.  It's not the cast, but the writers.  Better Brit cop series to be had with the likes of Endeavour, George Gently, etc.",1376179200,,647,4.845454545454546

American Crime shows have hero's who are above it all and more knowing then the average joe. British actors are more like me, less then prefect, yet using those little grey cells, are able to discover the who did it.  This show fits the bill, it makes me feel like I could fit right in.",1376092800,,383,4.380281690140845

The first two seasons had a self-contained running plot as does this one, however in Season 3 the actor and writers are more comfortable with the characters.

4529340,5,B00527QY88,"I love this show! I read a review where the critic said, ""Fresh but Familiar"". That's an excellent way to describe this show. You have your well written & acted police crime stories; but the twist is each story incorporates crimes out of history. Some of these historic cases are well known, some not so much' but they can be from any country, not just England or specifically London where this show takes place.

The new format is a nice change from Seasons one & two, which were cleverly done modern day 're-enactments' of very famous cases that took place in London. This season consists of three 2 part episodes. I won't rehash each plot line; but the stories will keep you guessing until the end. Each season saw a different group of officers on Chandler's & Miles' team. This season also sports yet another ensemble for  DI Chandler's team. I hope they keep this crew. The show seems to have found it's niche with this group of people. They finally have a nice balance of male & female characters & all have very distinctive personalities that blend well together onscreen.

Check out this show & let the talents of Rupert Penry Jones & Phil Davis delight you.",1375574400,,1166,4.596153846153846

4529348,5,B00527QY88,"Season One's ""Jack the Ripper"" imitator was marginally better, but both of the following seasons have been nearly as good.  The character of DI Chandler reminds one of ""Monk"" from the US series of that name, but here it's not played for laughs.  The cases are deadly serious, and the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering in the police force almost equally so.  The down-to-earth DS Miles is a perfect foil for the posh Chandler.

4529352,4,B00527QY88,"What a novel idea! Basing a mystery series on the hideous memory of one of our most sadistic and notorious killers Jack The Ripper. Though it took a minute or two of viewing this very well made British thriller to believe the premise, I finally accepted the idea. Is it a copy cat or has the Ripper left a descendent to carry on his bloody rampage? To answer this question the producers of the series craft an excellent build up of suspense which require watching the first two episodes.
After viewing such dreadful suspense one wonders how can they top that and maintain interest and believable stories in the ensuing episodes. The Brits do these detective stories better than anyone and Whitechapel is no exception. The last two episodes are especially interesting because of the OCD the protagonist DI Joeseph Chandler, played by Rupert Penry-Jones, suffers from. I can't wait for the fourth season to come online.",1375142400,,917,4.8471337579617835

4529356,5,B00527QY88,"Instead of concentrating on one set of murders as Season One and Two did, the copycats are covered in two episodes so more cases covered. Characters within the team are well drawn and the information and background on the killers being copied is compelling in itself. In themselves the new copycat crimes are full of surprises. The veteran actors in this series almost guarantee quality in themselves.

Season One is just a quick drink before dinner, while Season Two brings on the bangers and mash. Season Three was Yummy dessert of seeing how the team has become a real family.  So far, it's been a tasty treat of British life at the police station.",1374364800,,413,4.581081081081081

4529405,4,B00527QY88,"Whitechapel has, if anything, improved over the three series.  The development of the relationship between the DI and his sergeant has become very rich and, I think, realistic.  Even the most cartoonish characters from the first two series have become deeper.

I look forward to watching the fourth series when it becomes available.",1371686400,,332,5.226415094339623

4529416,5,B00527QY88,"The whole Whitechapel series is fabulous. While the stories are fanciful, gory and a bit retrograde, the presentation and the detail is excellent.  If you had that many serial killers in Whitechapel, there would be no one left in the neighborhood.  But it is the way the tales are told that catches you, draws you in and won't let you go.  Plus, the interaction between DI Chandler and Miles is fun.  Watching Whitechapel is a good way to while away a few hours.",1370822400,,462,4.530120481927711

This is the 3rd season available on Amazon.  I was fortunate enough to catch the 1st season and have been a fan since.
The stories are intriguing, the interaction in the precinct is fun. And there is just enough ""goofball"" presence to relieve the suspense.
I hope this series has more than just the 3 seasons and Amazon makes them available.",1370390400,,453,4.445783132530121

4529428,4,B00527QY88,"Crime is depressing, but it is interesting, at least for me to see fictionalized via video. The english view seems often realistic ( perhaps because it is foreign to my domestic experience? ), in contrast to American car chase crime which is often so predictable out come wise. Anyway Whitechapel has some good character actors, and the plots of historical parallel criminality is decent enough hook for me. Enjoyed all three seasons.",1370390400,,434,5.041666666666667

4529430,4,B00527QY88,"Without going into too much detail, this show (from watching Seasons 1-3) showed how setting a really good premise about a place really sets the tone for the ""future"": murder, and the different way ""history"" repeats itself through this type of criminal behavior. But also the back stories of each of the characters as they played their roles co-created by the writing and producing team, demonstrated how the police and the professionals they interacted with, were and were not impacted as this show unfolded.

The detectives that investigate these heinous crimes in Whitechapel are, apparently, not required to contaminate the evidence for it was rare that any of them wore gloves at the crime scenes.  I found myself telling them ""don't touch that! You're not wearing gloves."" They did not listen.

The forensic researcher found all crimes have been done before and in a particular sequence and pattern. Even though he was essential to the solving of the mysteries, he was relegated to the damp and crowded police basement where detectives needed to search for him among the volumes of historical evidence.

The characters are all unusual, but likable.  The story lines are complex, and involved.  The acting is really good.  I like it very much.  Not for someone who doesn't want to sit down, and really watch the show, but wonderful for those of us who like to take the time, to watch a story unfold, and get to know the characters.

4529444,4,B00527QY88,"OK, to be fair I started watching this series because I liked Rupert Penry-Jones in ""MI-5"" (called ""Spooks"" in the UK - I guess they couldn't call it that in the US because of it unfortunate connotation). In ""MI-5"" he was  dashing, sexy Adam Carter, a spy who never flinched at danger. In ""Whitechapel"" he is Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler, a smart guy in buttoned up suits who is ALMOST crippled by his OCD. I say ""almost"" because you can see him work (and frequently fail) to overcome his horror at blood, filth, and especially dead bodies. It is hard to imagine why he became a cop (something I wish was explored). The always excellent Phil Davis plays his sergeant. In the first season, he was the bully who tried to get rid of Chandler - but he has evolved into the friend who helps Chandler work around his OCD. A funny bit in this season is Chandler frantically asking for a handwipe after blindly grabbing a severed foot. The one thing that I am ambivalent about is Buchan, the Jack the Ripper expert who helped find a copycat killer in the first season. Now a police consultant he digs up historical cases with a similar MO to the current villain. While the ancient cases he digs up are interesting, I don't see how they really help solve current crimes. Unlike US cop shows there are no car chases, shootouts, etc. just thoughtful, clever scripts with interesting (and flawed) characters. A show that is very worth watching.",1368921600,,1439,4.599221789883268

4529451,5,B00527QY88,"Admittedly an Anglophile, I will watch any BBC crime anything, so this review is biased. Compared to,others in the genre this is probably only four stars, but compared to EVERYTHING you MIGHT watch, it is pretty good. Just gory enough to get your attention, the evil characters are more well defined than most. The main character, Played by jones, is thwarted by obsessive compulsive disorder. There is one scene where he smashes a wall switch with his,shoe rather than let it control him any further which gives you a great sense of how the character struggles to do his job. His ""partner"" in the show is a wonderful curmudgeon who is given all the best lines. You have to listen carefully to get the full fun out of them. The power grubbing boss is well played. The plot device where they try to relate everything to past crimes feels a bit gimicky and at times cumbersome, but the characters keep you hooked. Overall very watchable.",1368576000,,935,4.672727272727273

4529454,5,B00527QY88,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all three seasons of Whitechapel.  I found this series on Amazon prime as a suggestion after watching the BBC's series Sherlock.

Whitechapel is well written and well acted with riveting stories based upon historic events in London's Whitechapel district. All of the seasons have dealt brilliantly with the cases they were presented.  While the stories are engaging, it is the cinematography that draws me in.  The episodes are filmed in such a way that blends both traditional filming and more cryptic cinematic momentary flashes of action or evidence pertinent to the story. Each season reveals more information into the characters personalities, strong suits and failings and Season 3 was particularly engaging. I'm looking forward to many more seasons of Whitechapel. If you have difficulty with the British accents, give it an episode or two and it gets easier.",1368230400,,892,5.26056338028169

4529480,5,B00527QY88,"Disclaimer: I am a sucker for British procedurals & am a Ripper aficionado, so this one is a double-whammy for me with its Whitechapel setting.  That said, the pilot & subsequent series are outstanding.  Well-written stories.  Characters are well-drawn and expertly acted.  Anyone who has seen any British film (Bleak House comes to mind) or TV show will recognize Phil Davis, who is always outstanding.  But then, everyone else in the ensemble is great, too - love all the characters.  The atmosphere of the show and filming are mesmerizing.

It is a modern setting in Whitechapel, so no Ripper, but the evil & horror that the Ripper represents and Scotland Yard's failure to catch him  permeates the setting and effects everyone and everything.  I watched the pilot, not knowing it was a pilot, and came away wanting more.  By the way, the pilot is a stand-alone piece, not requiring further closure.  Even if you have never watched a British cop show, try this pilot.  Enjoy.",1367107200,,978,4.86060606060606

4529482,5,B00527QY88,"Hmm, my first video review here.  I really enjoy this show/series.  The subject matter is not for everyone, but I feel they do an excellent job of making things scary, mysterious or gripping.  Character development is good between Miles and Chandler and seems to happen organically; it doesn't seem forced in any way.  I've also enjoyed how they've continued to make the Edward Buchan character relevant as the show moves forward.

In all, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys good drama/mystery shows and doesn't mind a bit of uncomfortable gore at times.",1367107200,,559,4.967741935483871
4529483,5,B00527QY88,"its what makes the products so far apart from what we have here in the states.
The copies are better the org. stuff is better.
The British have real actor's to play real people that you like on the screen and you know within a 10miles you could find or know someone who looks and acts like this regardless of the story.
The story someone I feel are not that unreal but it's the way the UK can put together a show - cream raises to the top.
If you like drama watch it!
if you like crime or who done it's watch it!
I enjoyed the acting the story given to me and the way everyone from the small role actor to main all move together in front of you on a screen and for that short space in time you can believe all of this but never watch an US show after you find yourself very unhappy and when I find an new actor or an actor in a US shows they turn out to be Australian.
So we need to go all the way to Australia to find someone who is real and can actor (and they do it without any enough) one way you pick it up is that control the show and the others just support them.",1367107200,,1070,3.824324324324324

4529529,5,B00527QY88,"I'll admit that I love British police shows and, until yesterday, I'd never heard of this one.  But boy, am I glad I did.

The cast is excellent.  With the first episode in Series 1, your not certain what to expect.  You've the experienced, hardened sergeant and the fast-track, inexperienced DI with OCD.  You also have a case based on Jack the Ripper, which made me groan a bit as I'm very tired of that theme.  Not here, however.  Miles, the sergeant, believes in the job enough to give the DI a chance and, over time, trust and support him.  However, as every good sergeant should, he also guides him and brings him up short when he should.

Then there is Ben, the crime expert who starts as a nuisance but becomes an integral part of the time.  The show is extremely well cast, well acted and well written.

It is dark; there's no question about that.  The first series is four episodes dealing with one case; the second series is four episodes dealing with two cases and the third season is six episodes dealing with three cases.  Even with the shorter time given to each case, there is no loss of quality of suspense.

4529575,5,B00527QY88,"This is a wonderful series, if you have not watched from the first series you can watch them afterwards because they are separate stories.

4529576,5,B00527QY88,"I was not sure if this seres would catch me. It it. The build up of the charactrs during Season 1 is rewarding. The stories were good, the cutting edge production values made this a must see series. Please give us Season 4 soon !",1363219200,,229,4.111111111111111

4529582,5,B00527QY88,"I really enjoy this entire series.  Season 3 is a little bit different in that it has shorter stories but still with the hostorical references.  The acting is great and I really enjoy Phil Davis as DS Miles.  I first watched him in the BBC's Bleakhouse with Gillian Anderson.  All in all, a really enjoyable series if you enjoy the police procedurals.",1362960000,,351,4.612903225806452

4529596,5,B00527QY88,"LOVE crime stories in general but usually docmentary types. It is not easy to produce great crime dramas and WhiteChapel is REALLY good, not perfect but right up there. Rupert (first time I watched his performance) is superb and perfect for the part... and yep, he is dashing. And the supporting cast all do great jobs w- their characters... great writing... cannot wait for more. Just don't understand why the shows (mostly British ones) have only a few episodes each year.... what a long wait!! :(",1362441600,,499,4.813953488372093

4529598,5,B00527QY88,"Whitechapel uses history to catch you up in the present, and remind you that yes it does repeat itself, since after all we are all human, some less so than others. For fans of MI5 this is a different view of the hero Mr Jones.",1362441600,,226,4.044444444444444

4529603,5,B00527QY88,One of the best dark dramas out right now. The show has built beautifully on itself. The main actors have great chemistry together. DI Chandler played by Rupert Penry-Jones is coming into romance in this season and we cheer him on. He juggles his OCD with work and personal life with a humble touch and we sympathize with his loneliness and desire to find a soul mate he can live with. Maybe this time it is the right one!,1362009600,,422,4.3544303797468356
4529614,5,B00527QY88,"I've had Amazon prime for a while now, and I wanted to find some highly rated TV series that I haven't seen before.  I'm a big fan of mystery and crime solving series, so I hoped to find shows like Luther, Sherlock, Monk, Elementary, etc.  Whitechapel fits right in that list. I recommend watching all 3 seasons/series in order.  The characters progress and evolve over time fairly well and consistently.
The cases they solve are related to historical cases from England, but not all direct copy-cat crimes.  The episodes are well written and engage you into the stories and character's lives.  I hope there are more seasons/ series of this show, but I haven't checked IMDB.com yet.  Still, what's here is great to watch.",1361923200,,721,4.774193548387097

4529617,4,B00527QY88,"Good series.  It gave us many hours of entertainment.  The cast of characters were difficult to get used to at first, then the ""team"" gelled.  That was really when we began to like it.  We did have to pace ourselves, or we would have been in front of the TV for hours.",1361836800,,268,4.096153846153846
4529618,5,B00527QY88,I love this series because it combines detective work with history and has a ghostly/eerie element that adds to the suspense.  The characters are well-drawn and the humor offers relief from tension without being overdone or intrusive.  I want MORE.  Each episode (or sometimes 2-3 episodes) deals with a serial killing but a side character who loves history is always able to relate it to a series of killings from the distant past.  We receive a history lesson along with the drama and mystery of a good crime-solving story.,1361836800,,525,4.865168539325842

4529622,3,B00527QY88,The lead character is not very interesting and makes you wonder how such a person would achieve the rank of DI.  The DS is more interesting.  The writing is OK.,1361836800,,160,4.3

4529635,5,B00527QY88,"For the third season of the popular crime-drama ""Whitechapel"", the format is changed in order to accommodate the demand for more episodes. The concept of the first two seasons involved a present-day investigative team looking into a string of copycat killings that were based on famous historical murders - first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-the-Ripper/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack the Ripper</a>&nbsp;and then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Kray-brothers/dp/B004L40Z92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Kray brothers</a>, using a blend of contemporary tools and historical precedent to solve the crimes. Yet even by the time the Kray case was wrapped up, the formula was beginning to feel a little old, making it a wise decision to retool some of the basic elements of the show.

Instead of a three-part miniseries, this season is six episodes long, with three crimes to solve (each one divided into two parts). To keep the element of historical intrigue that made the first season so popular, the show uses old murders as a basis for their storylines rather than a template, with enthusiastic researcher Edward Buchan (who helped the detectives out on their last two cases) installed in the police archives. His job is to provide historical insight on the team's cases, hopefully inspiring them toward a solution and working on the motto that history shouldn't be repeated.

With only three of the six original team members left (Chandler, Miles and Kent), the opportunity is taken to introduce some more estrogen to the cast with the addition of Megan Riley, joining pathologist Caroline Llewyllen as a female presence to balance out not only the testosterone, but the overwhelming number of female murder victims. Also noteworthy is the wonderful rapport that exists between Chandler and Miles. Despite initially hating each other on sight, they're now confidants and friends, discussing everything from the cases, to family issues, to Chandler's OCD. Miles even fancies himself a bit of a matchmaker for Chandler, though it's not until the third episode that he expresses the (rather poignant) reasons why. In their conversations and interactions you can tell they trust each other implicitly. Now, if only Miles would start being nicer to Buchan...

The crimes themselves are very grisly and macabre, with the general attitude of the show-runners being ""make everything creepy."" As such, even minor elements are designed to be unsettling and strange - at one point, the team questions a witness who is a creepy old voodoo lady. She's in the episode for less than half a minute, and she could just as easily have been a benign housewife in a dressing gown - but the show opts for a creepy old voodoo lady instead. Even the police headquarters and the investigative office is a dim, shadowy, ominous place. It all results in a show that is immensely unsettling to watch - perhaps to compensate for this overload of creepiness, there are moments of levity involving the interplay of characters and their families.

As noted, the mysteries this time around are inspired by historical crimes rather than based on them, and the cases that Buchan uncovers - such as the Ratcliff Highway Murders and the Thames Torso Murders - are easily found on Wikipedia and other websites. There's also a chance to incorporate real police procedurals, and you end up picking up a lot of interesting tidbits: for instance, the pathologist comments that mass deaths usually involve families, with one killing the others as an extension of suicide (thus making the one featured in the show an anomaly) and later they comment that women are more likely to poison than men (thus leading the detectives to the conclusion that a poisoning/dismemberment case is the work of a couple).

The first episode involves a young woman who goes to fetch bagels for her co-workers, only to find the place locked and bolted on her return. With the assistance of a police officer they break inside, only to find a massacre. Four people are dead, but there's no sign of a break-in and no discernable motive. Buchan uncovers a similar case in the archives, but the investigative team struggle to find a connection between suspects and victims - and then another massacre occurs.

The second episode (my favourite) begins when a motorcyclist comes across a suburban fox - dragging a disembodied arm. A torso and a foot soon follow, both washed up by the Thames. With their only lead (and only witness) begin a fox, the team stake out its territory in the hopes that it will lead them to the source of the mutilated bodies. The pathologist comes up with a disturbing discovery: that before the girls were dismembered they were poisoned, thus bringing a whole new angle to the investigation.

The final episode deals with an escapee from an insane asylum that killed his entire family for the sake of peace and quiet. A manhunt ensues, one that intensifies when classmates of the killer's original victim are targeted - as well as therapist Morgan Lamb. Chandler strikes up a rapport with the attractive Morgan, but the rest of the team are confused as to why the killer is interested in her - she doesn't fit the profile of the others.

Unlike the others, this one is more of a thriller/horror than a crime/mystery, and though stories such as these will inevitably have some contrivances and implausibility, this one stretches things a bit far, with a huge coincidence regarding the timing of the deaths and a killer that seems almost super-human (which becomes even more improbably once he's been unmasked). It ends on a rather bleak note which may divide viewers, but thankfully a fourth season has been commissioned, which will perhaps give us some closure on the events that take place here.

Though this season is certainly much darker and creepier than its predecessors (and that's saying a lot considering what seasons one and two encompassed) this is still a top-notch crime drama, with appealing characters, intelligent writing and plenty of scares.",1361491200,,6132,5.204660587639311
