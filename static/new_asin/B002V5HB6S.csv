8381761,5,B002V5HB6S,It is a bit grainy but I am glad it exists at all. The Flight Manual is exactly what I wanted.,1451779200,,94,3.5238095238095237
8381762,3,B002V5HB6S,"I already had the films and expected something different; however, they are OK.  The manual is acceptable, but I would have paid more for the real thing; a 'paper printed one,' had it been available.",1428451200,,199,4.685714285714286
8381763,5,B002V5HB6S,"This has some good historical information even tho the video and such is below par. As one reviewer suggested ""...it looks like someones home movies!"" Well, a lot of it is as that is what we had back in the day. Yes, I was there lived with the BUFF(and loved it)for 4 years and have my own 8mm video that I took in and around the B52 both on the ground and in the air. The B-52 Flight Manual in and of it's own make it well worth the purchase price.",1401235200,,449,3.9450549450549453
8381764,5,B002V5HB6S,"My favorite aircraft of all time, in video, and in the aircraft's flight manual. It is a great work of reference and history that will be enjoyed for a long time.",1384473600,,162,4.258064516129032
8381765,5,B002V5HB6S,"A must-have for all modelers and fans,or those who flew or crewed  the B-52! Detailed shots and diagrams of the interior of the ""D"" model. Plus 3 great films on BUFF operations and landing characteristics and even flying an ""H"" model without a vertical stabilizer or rudder!",1379635200,,274,4.829787234042553
8381766,1,B002V5HB6S,"This DVD was supposed to have 3 movies about B52's but what was on the disc looks as if it were made by someone using an out-of-focus 8mm camera.  Very shoddy video, and confusing directions on how to access the 1,100 page dash1.",1379548800,,229,4.325581395348837
8381767,5,B002V5HB6S,I am a retired AF officer and was a Navigator on the B-52 so it was very interesting for me and my friends.,1328054400,,107,3.6956521739130435
8381768,5,B002V5HB6S,"The PDF file of the tech order alone makes the purchase worth the price alone. Very interesting book with lots of photos, pictures and diagrams.",1327276800,,144,4.8
