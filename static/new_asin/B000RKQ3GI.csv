Considering it was in 2001, this should be expected, EXCEPT: there is a reference in the telecast to the game being available in HD. (HD telecasts were in their ""infancy"" then) Where is the HD telecast? That is the source they should have used.

That said, it is great to be able to see these old games again. This is the game that is infamous for the highly questionable calls that allowed Duke to come back from a huge deficit. Yes, I am a Maryland fan, and I was at this game. But in all the epic Duke-Maryland games from that time, this was the only one that the pro-Duke calls were so bad, even non-Maryland sportscasters commented on it. And it is the only game that Maryland fans still talk about the officiating. That said, Maryland should not have let the calls rattle them. But they were a year away from having the poise of champions. Duke, and especially Battier, definitely had the poise. And coach K was in fine form.",1337731200,,983,4.4010989010989015
