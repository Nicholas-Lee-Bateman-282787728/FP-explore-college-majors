2552996,4,B000F6IOCA,"I agree that this movie may cover no new ground. But Mr. Seagal does not use a stand in and does his own work. His acting is believable, even if the ex-CIA billionaire is not. Once again he is an ex-CIA agent that ends up in a quest to find his kidnapped father. He is betrayed as usual, but nothing will stop him from finding her.

As a side plot, his daughters kidnapping is orchestrated so that his character will wreck havoc and get the attention of all the nefarious forces that are trying to gain a deadly bio-toxin which has been stolen from the CIA labs. Seagal performs some basic aikido and a couple of MacGyver tricks. So just sit back and enjoy the ride, it makes for a pleasant evening at the movies.",1167350400,7,713,4.281481481481482
2552997,5,B000F6IOCA,Great plot and superb action! He did a fine job in this film!!,1151884800,9,62,3.8461538461538463
2552998,4,B000F6IOCA,"Lord Steven releases lots of movies, so much so that its like having Christmas three or four times a year.  Now, my past few little ""Christmases"" have been disappointing.  So, I wasn't holding my breath for a masterpiece when I picked up ""Shadow Man""(its lame cover not easing my mind in the least).  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.

The plot is ridiculously convoluted, but here is a vague outline of what happens:  Lord Steven plays a billionaire businessman who was formerly a CIA agent.  He's also a widower raising a young daughter.  His father-in-law is still in the CIA and meets with the Lord and his daughter in Romania for a family trip.  Pops secrectly slips the Lord some sort of high-tech nano-virus without Seagal's knowledge then gets promptly blown up by a car bomb.  At the same time, the Lord's little girl gets kidnapped.  The rest of the movie is doublecross upon doublecross and no one really has any motive save for Seagal, who is out to get his daughter back.  Throw in some Russian gangsters(one of which who curiously looks like a mixture of Christopher Lloyd and Max Headroom)out to get the virus, shady government agents also looking for said virus, a femme fatale taxi driver, some excessive violence, and you get a quality Seagal feature.

Firstly, let me say that for the first time since 'Belly Of The Beast' that one of Seagal's movies has a director that actually seemed to give a crap.  Michael Keusch, a former German TV director, crafts a fine film with nice camera work, good dialogue, lots of action(mostly hand-to-hand with some nice akido showcased)...but the thing I really liked were the little details:  the bad guy with syphilis and his creepy mask, some eyeball ripping, a few brutal gunshots to the face, and a funny cab driver who shows up for a few moments.  Its nice, for once, to see a Seagal director take the time to go all out in everything from fight scenes to extraneous details.  This is the first time in a while that I've felt like the makers of a Seagal opus actually tried to make it be a good film.

Despite its silly opening scene(just watch for the watermelon and you'll know what I mean), 'Shadow Man' is easily Seagal's best film since 'Belly Of The Beast'.  He looks decent, though still a bit pudgy, but better than he's looked in a while.  There's some great fight scenes(the Lord's stuntdouble for once isn't quite so obvious), there's hardly any dubbing, and has quite a bit of excessive violence.  All the actors are good(even a small role from Brit actress Imelda Staunton), the plot is interesting if overly ambitious, and Seagal seems into it for once.  There's no cheese here, no filler at all.  'Shadow Man' is, by far, Seagal's leanest, meanest most action-filled flick in a while.  Seagalogists won't be disappointed.",1150502400,29,2796,4.7195876288659795
2552999,3,B000F6IOCA,"Here is Steven Seagal, again playing an ex secret agent, in a DTV that is once again shot in eastern Europe. This film was more enjoyable than some of Steven's last few movies. Seagal is more involved in the film, appears to be enjoying himself. There is enough action (gunfights, aikido) to hold your attention. Two thirds of the way through the film, he again puts on his familiar leather coat - even though it looks to be spring/summer in Romania. Biggest laugher - Steven takes on a large military helicopter with his trusty .45 automatic. Guess who wins that fight?",1150070400,4,570,4.653465346534653
2553000,3,B000F6IOCA,"The plot of Shadowman is a bit over-complicated...and it really doesn't break any new ground...BUT Seagal looks committed to this movie. Almost no fight doubles, he does his own over-dubbing, and acts like he is having a better time than he has in some of his past direct-to-video films. Movies seem to be an after thought. Check out his CD's to hear Seagal's totally passionate about what he is doing -- playing the blues.",1149897600,5,423,4.72972972972973
2553001,5,B000F6IOCA,"Simple story. Good pacing. Seagal looks like he's into it. I thought the fights were much like the Seagal of the Eighties. Brutal. No wire work to speak of.

Not a waste of time. I like this one much better than the last few he's cranked out.

It's just a fun little movie that doesn't take any energy to watch.",1149897600,3,311,4.166666666666667
2553002,2,B000F6IOCA,"With all the positive buzz on this Seagal release from various fan websites, I was expecting big things from this DTV title and for some of Shadow Man it did deliver what I was hoping for but also some of the usual poor production values that plague Seagals DTV releases. Excluding Mercenary For Justice, there is probably more fight scenes in Shadow Man all filmed with Seagal and not a stunt double than there has been in his last 3 DTV's combined. Two fights with multiple opponents in particular conjure up memories of his early Warner Brothers movies. The plot is involving enough although again as usual slighting overly complicated and the gun action is well staged. Seagal delivers some good one liners which produced a laugh here and there. Black Dawn had good production values but was ultimately rather boring, Mercenary For Justice showed signs that Seagal is again willing to participant in his martial arts and action scenes and Shadow Man even more so continues that trend.

But, Seagal just doesn't seem to have the same raw energy or interest he displayed in his early movies anymore such as Hard To Kill or Out For Justice which I don't think has anything to do with age and that is what is missing from these later day Seagal DTV's. On the down side though Seagal is doubled on most exterior scenes walking into or out of buildings and cars, there is also extensive use of rear projection green screen during the interior shots for the driving sequences. There is also the rather obvious fake helicopter explosion as shown in the trailer.

As a Seagal fan of his earlier movies, I did find things to like in Shadow Man and make alliances for the low budget in making the movie. Seagal should perhaps make 2 DTV's a year and give more time to each rather than pumping out up to 4 a year. Having said all that, Belly Of The Beast is my most enjoyed DTV from Seagal so far with Mercenary For Justice second and Shadow Man slotting into the number three position.",1149724800,4,1978,4.584745762711864
2553003,5,B000F6IOCA,"People should give Seagal some credit.  He actually did most of the fighting except the beginning sequence.  Some of the moves actually reminded me of some of his old stuff.  Hats off and I hope he does more films like this one!  Great action fights.  Yes he's a little slower, but so is Jackie Chan.  It called aging people so you morons cut him some slack.",1149724800,4,358,4.348484848484849
2553004,2,B000F6IOCA,"Don't misunderstand: I'm not saying this is a good movie.  But compared with all his other direct to DVD fare since Half Past Dead, this film at least has a coherent storyline and structure.  It was ALMOST like watching a ""normal"" movie, and Seagal's acting actually seemed a tad more enthused than his last several films.  Sadly, I have rented every one of them in hopes I would one day witness THE RETURN of one of my favorite action stars, all the while knowing it probably will never happen.  I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment.  Or maybe his films have become so bad I've been fooled into thinking this one is better, I don't know.  There are a few ""okay"" fighting sequences, certainly not up to par with the best of his work but better than most of what we've come to expect during the last four or so years of [...].  At least you actually see him doing something instead of, like, standing there while watching bodies fall around him (the fight scene among the mannequins in Black Dawn comes to mind).  I stopped buying Seagal's films some time ago and certainly wouldn't purchase this one, as it would only collect dust, but I do recommend this one film to any fan who has not witnessed the sad melee of garbage he's churned out during the last four years.",1149638400,,1272,4.452586206896552

I was disappointed. It's a weak effort. Seagal looked old and tired. I had trouble maintaining attention. The old espionage formula just didn't come through. The movie was a yawner in the first place and it just got worse as the movie progressed. Alas, perhaps it was just too late and it just couldn't captivate my interest. Might I watch it at  some other time? I don't think so. If you're a Seagal fan and just have to have everything, well it isn't very expensive. If you're looking for good exciting Seagal action/entertainment, well, I'd  continue my  search.

2553040,3,B000F6IOCA,"Regrettably for Steven Seagal's fans, few of his direct to video efforts in the last decade or so, have been very good.  On the plus side, The Shadow Man (2006) does feature some decently executed action sequences, as Seagal appears to be performing the majority of his fight scenes, and also using his real voice.  Unfortunately, while the action elements are passable, the story that ties them together is kind of sloppy, and not particularly plausible.

Seagal often seems to be playing the same character in many of his films, and that's much the case here.  His character Jack Foster, is a former intelligence operative who has just arrived at an airport in Bucharest with his daughter Amanda (Skye Bennett, making her film debut), when the girl is abducted by a cab driver named Anya (Eva Pope), as Jack's father-in-law George (Michael Elwyn), a CIA agent, is blown up in spectacular fashion.

A detached Foster seems rather unphased by these traumatic developments.  Making an impressive MacGyveresque escape from a trap in a country estate, Jack begins to search for his daughter.  Harry apparently went rogue and stole a bioweapon, and believing that he passed it on to Foster, both the bad guys and the U.S. Government are now after him, thus making his daughter a pawn in the deadly game.

Foster weaves a path of destruction, assaulting some police detectives, escaping capture by American agents, then stirring up trouble among the Romanian underworld, highlighted by Foster firing a round into the skull of an old woman trying to cut him down with machine gun.  He eventually catches up with Anya, after first attempting to strangle her, she then becomes his unlikely ally.

Like most of Seagal's recent efforts, this is a film to be enjoyed primarily for its violence and action elements, as presenting a credible story just isn't a major concern.  Not much in Shadow Man makes sense, as it attempts to fill in gaping holes in the plot, with numerous action sequences, fights, and shootouts.  Seagal's performance in the action department is actually very solid, as he doesn't rely heavily on camera tricks and editing, as he sometimes does.

Skye Bennett's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Floors/dp/B002V8U9PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Floors</a>) performance is not bad in her first film, but Foster doesn't seem to display much genuine concern for his daughter.  It's really all about the violence, which is quite plentiful, as Foster utters philosophical platitudes, while he muscles and shoots his way through the opposition, usually aiming for the head.  The bloody conclusion in a library, features a twist ending that is almost a throw away, as Foster administers the Dim Mak.

Among Seagal's direct to video catalog, Shadow Man is probably one of his stronger efforts, and certainly the best of his collaborations with director Michael Keusch, which also includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-Of-Fury/dp/B000NMTWZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight Of Fury</a>&nbsp;(2007), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Force/dp/B000LPLTVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Force</a>&nbsp;(2006) which ranks as one of Seagal's worst films.",1332374400,,3306,5.757700205338809

The budget was very low, as the special effects of Seagal shooting down a helicopter gunship with his .45 really sucked And the insipid Kung-fooey school of students. Just can't say enough for this bad movie.

I think he has a double standing in some scenes showing him in the shadows or of his back (as in Belly Of The Beast) because he's really put on some oink-oink pounds. And he has terrible pancake make-up applied to his aging mug. Plus, his over-dyed black hair with out-of-style ponytail makes him look like a clown.",1294531200,4,704,4.669354838709677

In fact, if I write anything about the plot, it would be a spoiler. So let me be cryptic. Seagal has something that the bad guys want. They send thugs to get it from him. The thugs get killed. They send more thugs...

Well made, good action with plenty of Seagal's calm approach to killing people. High body count, lots of blood. Some good chases. This movie is beyond ""easy on the brain"" (see Seagal, see thugs, see dead thugs, repeat). Yes, recommended if you want lots of action and fights.",1261526400,,649,4.319672131147541

even worse-off, considering there's a stunt for him walking,in

film is more boring then those of the past.
Also there is little hand-to-hand combat in this film
don't expect any fight quality of Out For Justice or The
Glimmer Man.

In the end,his eye-poke to a guy does ginzu-like damage,he hits
another guy in the chest - and his back explodes. Rent first if

2553045,3,B000F6IOCA,"Unlike many of Seagal's movies in the past few years, this one is actually pretty well-written and directed. There really aren't big plot holes in this film like some of the others, and the camera work is pretty well done on the action scenes and fight scenes. Plus, the supporting actors are serviceable and the film being shot on location in Romania added a nice backdrop for this espionage-type action movie. Perhaps best of all, unlike ""Attack Force"" or ""Kill Switch"" there isn't any obvious stunt double or voice dubbing. So the movie has a very clean and tight feel to it. There really was only one really ""cheesy"" scene where Seagal shots down a helicopter with only a pistol and it explodes in the air - that was pretty bad. However, there were some cool scenes of him using his Aikido with an acceptable level of Hollywood effect added to it.

My main criticism of the film is that it just wasn't all that interesting. Except for the opening chase scene when Seagal's daughter is kidnapped, and the typical Seagal-like finish to the film where everyone ends up dead, the middle of the movie is quite dull despite only being a 95-minute movie it felt like it dragged on for over 2 hours. In fact, I was so bored by it at times that I paused it a couple of times to get something to eat & drink - something I don't often do if I'm really into a movie.

The film feels like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>&nbsp;in rewind, with dreary visuals and poor fight scenes highlighting an over-complicated storyline that's impossible to care about.

The story: martial artist and businessman Jack Foster (Seagal) sees his daughter (Skye Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-the-Dark/dp/B001MLZNKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against the Dark</a>) kidnapped during a mysterious airport attack while Jack himself is targeted by Romanian officials and mobsters believing him to be in possession of a devastating biological weapon. Gunned at from all sides, he must team with a beautiful ex-government agent (Eva Pope, ""Coronation Street"") to eliminate the threat and save his daughter.

My description may sound relatively simple enough, but nevertheless, this is one of the most convoluted films Seagal's ever appeared in. As an action hero, Steven has never really needed brainiac storylines to get over, but the script of ""Shadow Man"" calls for the plot to take at least two disorienting twists, feature a supporting cast the size of China, and require the viewer to juggle the intentions of several characters amidst the general chaos. That last aspect may have been fine if there was a single interesting character in the whole movie, but almost everyone here is completely faceless. Seagal himself comes off as a callous jerk and an awful parent. Eva Pope is easily the most memorable performer in the movie, but that's not saying much.

The production is sub-standard. The film utilizes the ""shaky camera"" technique to maddening effect and the locales are consistently colorless and boring to look at. Action scenes fail to exhilarate: Seagal busts out an aikido move every half hour, but all of the hand-to-hand fights, shootouts, and car chases are cut so irregularly that you'll hardly have time to register what's going on in half of the shots. For a couple nice touches, though, Jack builds a nifty MacGuyver-style bomb with a phonograph and somehow manages to shoot down a combat helicopter with a pistol. Nevertheless, it's far from satisfying, especially after the beginning of the movie teases some martial arts coolness by featuring Seagal demonstrating the fabled ""dim mak"" technique.

In conclusion, I would only recommend this film if you particularly enjoy Seagal's direct-to-video efforts, because it'll take some commitment to get to like this one, even from established fans.",1210118400,4,3029,6.103286384976526

2553051,5,B000F6IOCA,"I'm a Seagal fan and this is a must have for all Seagal fans. This is one of his better action movies. I'm giving this movie 5 stars based on the action alone. There is an explosion at the start of the movie which was done very well. This is not the type of special effects I expect in a direct-to-video release. This was more of a big budget movie explosion. A bomb in a car explodes causing a huge fire ball, and the shock of the explosion shatters windows. The second reason this movie gets 5 stars is the action was great. The car chase was excellent. There were many gun fights. The martial arts fights were good. The third reason for 5 stars is the supporting cast was very good. The person who plays the CIA officer and the person who plays the local police chief were exceptionally well acted parts. This movie gets a R for lots of violence and nudity.",1190851200,,860,4.25
2553052,2,B000F6IOCA,"Steven Seagal was never a great actor, even in his prime. He was a good action star though. I've always had some respect for him as he's a 7th Dan in Akido and a respected martial arts practioner. However this is a sadly unconvincing film that does him no credit at all.

Now rapidly approaching the age of 56, Seagal has put on a lot of weight and his acting and delivery is even more wooden than it was. Sure the fight scenes are good, close-up its obvious he knows his stuff and you wouldn't want to mess with him, but as an action star his time has passed. The plot such that there is really isn't worth describing, and the only redeeming element was Imelda Staunton's performance as the American Ambassador, which is a class above the rest of the cast.

My recommendation rent don't buy this.",1186963200,,797,4.378378378378378

2553054,2,B000F6IOCA,"""Shadow Man"" is one of the better entries in a string of direct-to-video Steven Seagal films. The productions are decent and the supporting actors are better than usual. It is far from such films produced by major studios as `Under Siege' or `Exit Wounds,' but well, he seems doing most of his actions himself. But I believe most action film stars are supposed to do his stunts or at least make it look like that.

The story is, as usual, nothing special. Seagal is an ex-CIA operative whose daughter is kidnapped. And he is involved in some conspiracy about a bio-chemical weapon. As the story unfolds, you just start to follow the convoluted plot and anyway will decide to sit back and keep watching Seagal killing the typical villains mostly sporting English with Russian accent.

But what really matters is action, and the first 30 minutes are pretty good. The film opens with Seagal teaching his pupils in his dojo, flipping and throwing away them with his aikido, and that reminds me of his earlier films in the 80s. Then there are some OK car actions and shoot-outs, which are shoddily edited, but the stunt persons are doing good jobs. The film then loses steam, and actions get more and more insipid. Wait for one unintentionally funny scene in which Seagal's character fights back a helicopter only with a pistol. The results are laughably cheesy effects

As a mysterious taxi driver beautiful Eva Pope appears. Maybe she is too good for this film, but more surprising is the cameo appearance of Imelda Staunton, winner of Laurence Olivier Theater Awards and Oscar nominee for her amazing acting in `Vera Drake.' Watching her standing side by side with Seagal is a bit surreal experience for me.

""Shadow Man"" is a better than average Seagal direct-to-video actions, but that isn't saying much given the efforts put to his recent films.",1170633600,14,1846,4.813880126182966
