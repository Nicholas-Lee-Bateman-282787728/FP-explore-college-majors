4238089,4,B00404ME0Q,"Aaron Corbett (Paul Wesley of the Vampire Diaries) is an orphan who has found a loving home. He's got a great life, supportive family, he's a jock, he's smart, basically he can write his ticket to any college he wants. Then on his 18'th birthday everything changes; hidden powers emerge and he learns the terrifying truth that he is a Nephelim. A Nephelim is a cross between a fallen angel and a human and is considered an abomination by the Powers (Gods angels). He will be hunted down and destroyed unless he accepts his destiny as the Redeemer, the prophesied Nephelim who is the savior to the fallen angels.
The movie series centers around him finding out, accepting, and surviving to fulfill his destiny. The movie is interesting and well done. While it does take liberties from the best selling book series it's still well done and will keep you interest.
 The acting is excellent though at times overdone. I loved the character of Gabriel the Labrador but I wish his voice hadn't seemed so contrived. The special effects were overall well done and I especially liked that they didn't over do the flaming swords.
I didn't give this a 5 star rating because while there are shows on TV that come off feeling more like a movie this definitely has a Made-for-TV feel.",1272153600,50,1269,4.665178571428571

4238158,5,B00404ME0Q,"Torn between good and evil, like all beings with free will are, Aaron Corbett is in high school and is doing very well in academics and athletics. When he becomes 18 years of age, he notices that he has abilities beyond other human beings. Paul Wesley plays the role of Aaron Corbett and you should recognize Paul from The Vampire Diaries on CW Network. It is revealed to Aaron that he is a Nephilim, a genetic combination of human and angel which makes him a target by both the afterlife and other humans. He soon discovers that not only is he Nephilim, he is the most important one in history! He is then called The Redeemer, a Nephilim with the astral power to reform demons back into angelic form(s). He fights both angels and demons to survive and then must confront Lucifer/Satan played by Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame(Walter White). I will just say the bad cliche used, spolier or not, in this movie when Lucifer/Satan tells Aaron that he is Satan's son which sounds entirely too much like Star Wars. Lucifer even says to ""search your feelings and know it is true"". Stolen line/scene from Star Wars anyone? However, just about every comedy show I have ever watched that talks about Star Wars uses that line anyway. Fallen is NOT a comedy though. Fallen is fantasy/religion/action. This film is based heavily on the Holy Bible and although the storyline probably never happened entirely the way told, true believers know that similar events have happened in the past several millenia(4-5,000 years)ago. ""And the Sons of God came to Earth and mated with the daughters of humans"":Genesis. Look it up. If you liked The Prophecy starring Christopher Walken in a film about angels fighting each other, you will like this film although Fallen is not quite as dark or gritty. Fallen is a little more made for family entertainment but do not let that fool you; there is plenty of martial arts style action with swords of fire and karate/muay thai style action! Look for stars of other films in this movie and be pleasantly surprised. Remember the opponent of Electra in the Jennifer Garner film? He plays a Kung Fu/Wushu angel that enjoys his job TOO much. I would rate this film in the PG to PG-13 area due to swordfighting, martial arts strikes and kicks, and fireball throwing although no blood is shown. Enjoy!",1420675200,,2319,4.714285714285714

4238170,5,B00404ME0Q,"I really enjoyed this miniseries. Never read the books, so I don't know how they compare. Bryan Cranston was awesome in his role as was the actor who played Azazel (Hal Ozsan). The cg effects are a bit archaic by today's standards and some elements seem to be directed towards a YA audience. Overall very enjoyable though.",1419206400,,322,4.666666666666667

4238213,2,B00404ME0Q,I like this movie but it would have been better as a motion picture than a mini series and they should have picked actors more passionate with there rools. I could not connect with anyone in this movie so perhaps it is best the money was not wasted to make it a movie instead of a mini series. A lot of time gone watching it I will not get back.,1399507200,,345,3.942857142857143
4238214,4,B00404ME0Q,"Here is a boy turned half angel, sought out by god's killer angel's, trying to live a normal life saga. The story is good, not great, hence the 4 stars and not five. You may feel different however.  The special effects are top notch. The characters portrayed well, though Paul Wesley seems a little out of place here after seeing him in Vampire Diary's. Would I recommend this yes and no. Yes, to anyone who enjoys this sort of stuff and no to anyone looking for A movie quality. This is defiantly far better than B movie quality but less than A Movie quality, it's somewhere in between.

4238216,5,B00404ME0Q,"Paul Wesley is amazing in this film. If you like movies about angels and demons, war and chaos this is a film for you. Its a small mini series. All star cast, great special effects, this film will keep you interested. Unlike other films it goes in to detail about all characters as well as their backrounds, so you will be sure to learn things about angels and demons you might not have known before. I highly recommend it.",1396742400,,423,4.367088607594937

4238218,5,B00404ME0Q,I ordered this cause it had Paul Wesley in it and I had read the books. This is the once case where the movie is better than the book series it is based on. I thought the movie was different and interesting and the actors did really well in it.,1394064000,,244,3.9
4238219,2,B00404ME0Q,"My opinion is probably biased because I really liked the books.  I especially liked how the author of the books made Lucifer someone you could really like and stepped away from the traditional view of Lucifer that the movie chose to go with.  The book was about redemption and forgiveness and the movie was about keeping the story simple.  I suppose if there had been more action and some connection between any of the characters I could have viewed this as a passable show, but that was not the case.  So, if you really liked the character development and stepping outside the box that the book did you will not like the TV shows and should spend your money elsewhere.",1393200000,2,669,4.55
4238230,5,B00404ME0Q,"This movie is fantastic. I like it very much and watch it every chance I get, especially when there is nothing on television to watch. It deserves a five star rating and I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1393113600,,209,4.384615384615385

4238238,4,B00404ME0Q,this was a family friendly show the story seemed to have been rushed and seemed  like they could of expanded on this and made it a series.but it was pretty good if you  wanted to watch something as a family. for me it was a bit PG though so i probably wouldnt have continued if it was a series.,1380758400,,294,3.9661016949152543

4238250,5,B00404ME0Q,This is a very good show. All three episodes are on this cd which is good. The only thing is that each episode is an hour and a half so you either have to start early enough or watch it two days.,1378684800,,195,3.6666666666666665
4238251,4,B00404ME0Q,Really liked this show!  Just wish I hadn't read the book afterwards as it kind of took something away from the dvd.  I think it is well worth having though.  The characters are great and the interactions betwwen them is really great!,1376870400,,234,4.523809523809524

It has nothing or rather hardly anything in common with the books the lead angel instead of being a male is a female, the lead character doesn't work add a veterinarian's office like he does in the book and the big clincher his foster parents don't die in the end and his foster brother doesn't get kidnapped that's what made me stop watching a movie cause how can the brother not get kidnapped and the movie be anything remotely close to the book.  Needless to say the movie was exceptionally painful to watch.  DO NOT Waste your money!!!!!!!!!",1363305600,,702,4.384615384615385

4238278,3,B00404ME0Q,"I enjoyed this miniseries on Blu-Ray, but I found myself getting more and more annoyed by the editing.  At every commercial break, instead of nicely tapering off the music and sound effects way ahead of time and dissolving the audio with a clean cut for the video so that it feels seamless, they just suddenly duck the music at the last second and do a fast fade past black, often returning to completely different music.

As somebody who used to do a lot of TV production work, I found it very jarring, particularly during the third part, where you'd be smack in the middle of an intense action sequence, and then bam, suddenly the entire feel of the program shifts without warning.  That makes it glaringly obvious where every commercial break fell.

Contrast this, for example, with Stargate SG-1, where they designed it for continuous viewing, and unless you just know how to spot the act breaks, it feels like a short film.  That's the way TV editing should be done.  Besides, there's no guarantee that a rebroadcast will put the breaks in the same places anyway, which is why a well-edited TV show should *always* be seamless when viewed without commercials even if you don't plan to make it available on DVD.  You can always put in the fades after the fact, but you can't easily take them out if they're poorly burned into the master.

This miniseries makes me wonder if any of the editors actually sat down and watched each part from beginning to end before the program aired.  It just feels sloppy.  Somebody should really go back and at least put in some J-cuts or something.",1359676800,4,1585,4.628571428571429

4238309,5,B00404ME0Q,"I was so pleased to be able to purchase this DVD, been trying to for ages.
This 3 part movie starring Paul Wesley keeps you watching from the start to the finish, moving smoothly into each episode keeping your attention to the very end. I like all the actors who were chosen for each part who made this movie come alive and together. Even Lucifer, was pleasing to the eye and not ugly and gorey as usually depicted, who being the tempter of the wrong side of life by trying to manipulating Aaron with lies to reach his goal.
When Aaron needed to find the truth I found the words from the ""healer"" when he asked which was the right thing to do with her replying that it was his choice to make that decision.
This is a wonderfully produced and directed movie with wonderful actors, where I don't understand why it wasn't in the so called top 10 (or whatever) list that comes from the people who tell us which is the best. (I find mostly they are wrong about movies, some they have as no1 are darn awful (hehe))
The only thing I found wrong with this movie was that when it finished I wanted to watch more.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen/dp/B0038MUZ3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen</a>",1315612800,,1231,4.784037558685446

4238324,5,B00404ME0Q,"The Fallen were some very good shows.  I would love for them to do more of the shows. Showing Aaron returning home to his family and doing good deeds while he's there. The show could have gone several different ways, if they would keep it going. Never the less it was a good show.",1301961600,,280,4.185185185185185
4238325,4,B00404ME0Q,"Ok so this movie was nothing like the book. I read all the books and when I heard there was a movie I had to watch it. I read the books last year and they were so good and I can honestly say that you could see me everywhere I went I had my kindle in my hands reading The Fallen series.

When I heard about the movie I was so excited cause I was picturing the characters in my head already. Who better to play the part of Aaron Corbett than Paul Wesley. Great actor in Wolf Lake and some other TV shows. I thought that was a good idea.

Now what I didn't really like about the movie was that they made up charaters in the movie who don't even come out in the book. Virgil is suppose to be the main bad guy in the series and then I find out he dies in the first part of the movie. O_o WTH!

The city of Aries does not even get mention. And also....in the book Lucifer is good and trying to repent from what he did. In the movie....he's bad and dies?

I actually believe that this show could have gone longer if they had shown it on the CW. I mean look at the Vampire Diaries.

Overall, it was a good movie. Not exactly what I wanted but it got the job done of pretty much saying that Aaron is the redeemer.

I strongly urge everyone to read the Fallen series because it will litterally leave you at the edge of ur seat and you won't want to stop reading.",1297296000,,1352,3.9160583941605838

4238345,5,B00404ME0Q,"Based on the FALLEN books (eg. Fallen, Leviathan, Aerie & Reckoning) written by Thomas Sniegoski . . . unfortunately (as with most movies) it doesn't follow the true path in the books. Personally I found the books to be far better. The movie was good in its own way, but I like the way the book ended better than the movie.
  Originally an ABC family mini-series, which was first aired in 2006 (The Time of the Redemer) and followed with additional episodes in the summer of 2007 (Mysterious Ways and All That, Someone Always Has to Die and Il Gran Rifiuto aka the Grand Refusal).
  The movie introduces us to Aaron Corbett . . . a Nephilim . . . the offspring of an angel and mortal woman. Hunted by the Powers leader Verchiel (a woman in the movie), Aaron is informed by a Fallen Angel of his TRUE nature. Of course he is in denial, but events slowly unfold as his angelic powers start rising to the surface. When Verchiel goes to his home she's hell bent on anniliating him, but after blasting him into fire he walks out, his angelic nature surfaces and he battles with her. He is then forced to flee home with the angel Camael and his dog Gabriel, he leaves all his loved ones behind.
  A prophecy foretold  "" . . . in the footsteps of his father, in the sign of Virgo, a Redeemer will be born. His hands will deliver fair judgement. Ye will know him by his markings, names on his flesh reveal his mercy. The Redeemer shall judge what the Fallen have done and bring the Fallen to ascension and glory one more. Many shall seek him. Those meaning to destroy him will guide him to his fate. Again all of the damned or Fallen shall know Paradise, once again the Fallen will have time to make right where they went wrong.""
  During an encounter with the Powers Camael is wounded. They search for the angel Ariel, who is a gifted healer. Aaron visits a college campus and learns more about the stories of angels and the Fallen from a professor. The professor takes Aaron to his home to show him proof . . . Aaron sees Vilma, a girl he knew in high school . . . she is a Nephilim too.
  After rescuing Vilma, the Powers are hot on his trail, now lead by Mazarin  they continue to hunt him down. Camael tells Aaron and Vilma to flee, and he is captured by the Powers. Another fierce Fallan warrior angel by the name of Azazel joins Aaron, Vilma and Gabriel. Azazel lies, and tells Aaron that Camael is dead. He promises to take Aaron to the Light Bringer, the oracle who wrote the prophecy and who would be able to tell Aaron WHO his angelic father is.

  Unfortunately this mini series stirred up alot of controversy (not too surprising), as some folks fail to realize this is a work of FICTION and a MOVIE (not a documentary). Some religious folks are probably offended because this story does not follow the Bible . . . hello,  this is ""fantasy"" all things go, it does NOT have to follow the Bible. Seriously, I think the movie portrayed LUCIFER as the BAD guy (as do most religious writings), if the movie had followed the BOOKS, then religious folks would REALLY be offended . . . the books are far more graphic and violent and portray the first of the Fallen, Lucifer, as a person you feel sorry for . . . anyhow, just enjoy the movie for what it IS . . . a wonderful story with nice special effects. I thought it was AWESOME! So glad it FINALLY came out on DVD, been waiting a LONG time for that!!!!!!!!!!

2. Fallen Part 2  -- Fallen was originally a 2 part movie event.  Parts 1 and 2 were produced in 2006.

Now MY review...

I was THRILLED to see something so different on TV especially when it has religion in it. Most Networks and well EVERYONE avoid Religion and Politics even if it IS Fiction. I was really hoping that this would have been a actual SHOW and not Just a Mini-Movie. That said I WAS Really Happy with what they did in telling his story BUT they did leave a cliff-hanger. So It is possible to get MORE someday. If You have any interest in anything having to do with Angels both Good and Bad, Then this ""Movie"" Is for you.

Now if you think that is a plot spoiler, you slept through the opening monologue reinforced by the classroom scenes. Actually there are no such thing in theology but if you create a series around it, it must be true.

The film is filled with teen angst and I can see where it would have a tween girl appeal, but as they enter adulthood they will see it is as nauseating as ""Twilight"" and just as poorly acted.
