2377863,5,B000A7B8ZY,I have used other workouts programs but nothing like this it works great you can really feel the burn I definately recommend buying this,1342656000,,136,4.708333333333333
2377864,4,B000A7B8ZY,Everything seems to be going well so far. Beginning to notice some definition and I can definitely feel the difference in strength. Over all pretty happy and this is easy to get into.,1331078400,,183,4.575757575757576
2377865,5,B000A7B8ZY,"This guy always has great sit up suggestions to use, I wish the tape was longer, there's only a need to watch it once or twice to remember what he tells you to do.  I don them 2x a day and I feel tightness, its only been 2 weeks since I've been diligent with my routine.",1311811200,,270,3.8214285714285716
2377866,5,B000A7B8ZY,"I tried doing other ab workouts online but I found they just did not work. This workout is really intense, however, if you're a beginner, Tony shows you how to tweek the workout so it will better suit you. I absolutely love love love this workout! Get it if you can! You will not be sorry!",1290297600,5,289,4.178571428571429
2377867,5,B000A7B8ZY,The results are really quick and I just can't go wrong with that. Super effective.,1279065600,3,82,4.533333333333333
2377868,4,B000A7B8ZY,I was disappointed that this wasn't the more intense P90X Ab Ripper X version (it's one of Tony Horton's earlier routines) but it still provides a good workout in an extremely short amount of time. It may not be for beginners though. I would recommend it more for individuals who have already moderately developed their abdominal muscles.,1270857600,7,338,4.947368421052632
2377869,5,B000A7B8ZY,"Good Ab tape in a short period of time.
I recommend it if you don't have a lot of time, you can really feel it.",1262822400,,111,3.48
2377870,5,B000A7B8ZY,Very quick workout.  Targets all sections of abs.  Challenging and seems to be working!,1252022400,,87,5.142857142857143
2377871,4,B000A7B8ZY,i am very happy with this workout...using it with a cardio workout can get great rssults,1247788800,,88,4.5625
2377892,3,B000A7B8ZY,Don't buy it - just do Ab Ripper 100 twice.,1417305600,,43,3.4
2377893,1,B000A7B8ZY,I was shocked that this was so incredibly lame. In just minutes it was over with instruction on a few very basic exercises and a wish for good luck. BS,1410652800,2,151,4.066666666666666
2377894,5,B000A7B8ZY,This is just as effective as ab ripper x if not more so.  The video does different moves that are not in ab ripper x.  so the 2 together should give you max results.  it is only 6-7 minutes and moves at a good pace.  you can always pause it if it goes too fast.  And the girl in it is pretty hot stuff.,1395273600,2,302,3.65625
2377895,4,B000A7B8ZY,"Good work out, only 6 minutes which is great for doing in the morning! But Tony is super annoying but motivating",1394409600,,112,4.380952380952381
2377896,5,B000A7B8ZY,"Targets all sections of my abs....I used this routine about five years ago and in no time had a tight, toned midsection. I had the vhs version however and no longer own a vcr, so I purchased this dvd copy a couple of weeks ago to get back to my toned self after having my baby. Don't let the short length of this routine allow you to think it won't work.  Although it is short, it DOES produce results! Great for moms who have little ones that demand your frequent attention. You DO have to combine this workout, or any other workout for that matter, with clean eating in order to see results. If you need guidance with clean eating, google Tosca Reno, the clean eating queen! Tony Horton's workouts are hands down the best out there!",1388620800,2,734,4.357664233576642
2377897,5,B000A7B8ZY,"I am a mom of a toddler. This work out kicks my butt, but is also short enough my daughter isn't missing out on any mommy time!",1371600000,,127,3.740740740740741
2377898,5,B000A7B8ZY,The video really makes you work real hard and leave you have a sore abdominal area after the work out. after this i would use the p90x ab video after this video becomes easier,1368748800,,175,4.176470588235294
2377899,5,B000A7B8ZY,so its a pretty good burn for ur abs i really loved this video short and sweet kinda tough at first for a 6 min video but great when u have limited time. i definitely recommend this if u don't have much time to get much work out in and ur looking to scalped ur abs,1355616000,3,264,3.732142857142857
2377900,5,B000A7B8ZY,"yes this is the older version but it works, itll make ur stomic hurt!!! so if you want a work out this dvd will do it!",1354492800,,118,3.576923076923077
2377901,1,B000A7B8ZY,Too much money for such a short typical dvd!! I was shocked that I paid 18.00 plus shipping for a 10 minute dvd. Very standard sit up moves.  Nothing new and challenging,1343692800,5,169,4.28125
8075648,5,B000A7B8ZY,"I complete this workout every evening and have noticed a significant difference in my stomach. I am a runner, so I supplement my core with this. Its an older video, but I highly recommend it!",1521331200,,191,4.485714285714286
8075649,5,B000A7B8ZY,Love it!,1518998400,,8,3.5
8075650,2,B000A7B8ZY,I was disappointed that this $20 DVD had just a single 5min ab workout and about 10min worth of commercials.  I had thought there would be a couple different workouts at least...,1513900800,,178,4.5625
8075651,4,B000A7B8ZY,good stuff!,1510704000,,11,5.0
8075652,3,B000A7B8ZY,very basic,1462924800,,10,4.5
8075653,5,B000A7B8ZY,"Love it!  This is an older version of the P90X but abs are abs, Tony knows abs!  Whew!",1462838400,,86,3.7222222222222223
8075654,5,B000A7B8ZY,I actually love this workout! It's only 6 minutes long so I use it at the end of my other workout. Or if I'm short on time I just use this on its own. Everyone has time for 6 minutes!,1439683200,,183,3.6
8075655,5,B000A7B8ZY,Met all expectations and more!,1434240000,,30,5.2
8075656,4,B000A7B8ZY,Great quick work out. Good to do one days with no time to just get blood pumping for a few minutes and work some muscles,1431475200,,120,3.84
8075657,4,B000A7B8ZY,Nice short work out for abs.  I would like another 10 minutes of intense ab workout,1428710400,,83,4.1875
