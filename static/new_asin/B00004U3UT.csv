8168278,4,B00004U3UT,"I sat down to watch this movie thinking that I would be mildly entertained - - but I was pleasantly surprised!

Owning a vast collection of Kung Fu movies myself, I think that some of the most entertaining Kung Fu movies are the ones that have a revenge plot. Where the villains are so despicable you want to see them die. This movie is another perfect example of just that. For example, the main villain kidnaps women and puts them into prostitution as well as being a cold blooded killer (i.e. - having his men do most of the dirty work). (He simply wants the heroes' entire family wiped out at any cost).

The fight scenes are great and the characters seem to use a lot of Karate and Wing Chung techniques (similar to the way Chen Sing fights in his movies). There's very little wire-work in this movie(which is a good thing) and as an extra added bonus there is an addition of Muy-Thai Kick boxers who seem to give Jimmy Wang Yu a run for his money!

All in all, I was fixated with watching this movie from beginning to end simply because of the many fight scenes and some character development. If you are a Kung Fu movie collector (like I am) this is a very good movie to have in your collection! I highly recommend this movie to casual viewers as well as collectors alike.",1370131200,,1279,4.343096234309623
