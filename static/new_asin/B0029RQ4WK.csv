8358149,5,B0029RQ4WK,"This production by Showtime Australia follows the lives of four escorts working out of a high-scale brothel in Melbourne, Australia. A story line like this runs the risk of becoming a flat collection of short stories or episodes of the women plying their trade, heavy on the erotica and nudity, and light on depth of script.
That is not the case in this series. There are four women: Chloe, a single mother striving to balance her life as a sex worker with raising a thirteen year old daughter. Heather, in a committed lesbian relationship, who is considering pregnancy. Tippi, a free spirited girl who dreams of being a writer and considers her profession a calling. Mel, the highest priced escort of them all, is trying to move her career up to the next level. And finally, Lauren, the forty something year old wife of a philandering husband who, serendipitously, finds herself escorting, and doing well at it.
The characters are rounded, well developed, with lives inside and outside the brothel. We care for them, cheer for them and, when disaster strikes, cry for them too.
Do not worry, men, there is enough sex and nudity to keep it interesting, but probably you will watch this with your significant other, unless she is a real prude, because there is a lot of story and drama in it, enough to satisfy anyone.
Unfortunately this series has not been shown by Showtime USA, we can guess why, and has not been released in the US. I watched it on DVD from Netflix, and intend to buy the series when it is released in the US (if ever) The second season is only available on streaming download from the same source.",1293408000,6,1617,4.637630662020906

8358151,5,B0029RQ4WK,"I came upon this Australian production whilst browsing a movie rental website which I subscribe to and was hooked (pun intended) from the first episode. ""Satisfaction"" mainly revolves around the lives of five female prostitutes who work at 232, an up-scale city brothel. Though it would be easy for a series with such a risque premise to wallow in cliches, ""Satisfaction"" actually balances the kinkiness and credible human drama quite well. Madeleine West plays Mel, a very attractive and confident call girl who is also the brothel's biggest moneymaker, drawing in clients from all over the world. Mel seems to have it all - money, a lavish lifestyle, and men willing to give her almost anything, but there is a void in her life. Things gets complicated when Mel starts a relationship with the brothel's proprieter Nick (Robert Mammone) who starts to become very possessive over Mel. Nick's daughter Natalie (Kestie Morassi) helps manage the client bookings, sort of like the madam of the operation. There's Lauren (Alison Whyte) who despite a rather affluent background decides to join the profession after suffering the humiliation of being dumped by her husband for a much younger woman. There's an episode titled ""Lauren Rising"", which focuses on Lauren's attempts at 'embracing' her new job and proved to be one of the more titillating and entertaining episodes in this first season. Diana Glenn plays Chloe, a single mom of a teenage daughter who tries to keep her job a secret from her daughter. Chloe is a devoted mom who only wishes to provide the best life for her daughter, given her own troubled childhood, but things fall apart when her daughter discovers her mother's secret.

Tippi (played by Bojana Novakovic) is a free-spirited, motherless young woman who also harbors ambitions to become a writer, and indulges her clients fantasy needs, which includes a man who likes her to play dead while he has sex with her, pushing it to dangerous limits. Finally, there's Heather (Peta Sergeant) who fulfills her clients fetishes and who is also a lesbian. When Heather discovers she's pregnant, it not only jeopardizes her job but also her relationship with her lover Ally. The show's strengths lie in the credible exploration of the main characters' lives - these are not just one-dimensional hookers with the usual cliched storylines, but seemingly real people with real problems. Though some of the sex scenes can be a tad over the top, especially the ones with the fantasy role-playing, on the whole the scenes are tastefully done, and can be termed more of soft porn (there is lots of nudity, including some full frontal nudity). Every episode develops each character a little more, revealing the various facets of what make these women (and men) tick and though this is fiction, it does provide interesting insights into the lives of these call girls. I do hope this series gets released on DVD in the US soon, followed by Seasons 2 & 3. Btw, both Seasons 1 & 2 are currently available for instant play on Netflix.",1272931200,9,3030,4.9411764705882355
8358152,5,B0029RQ4WK,"Love these episodes.  After one show I was addicted and flew through the entire season in a matter of a few days.  Haven't started with Season 2 yet, but I can't wait!  This is a fun show that focuses on women who work in an upscale brothel.  It totally gives me the feel of a Sex & the City, only these women are always in control.",1271548800,5,332,3.984848484848485
