3149669,4,B00164KYV4,"Hey, you...stop sitting by the phone waiting for him to call...get up and go watch this movie!

I have to admit, I'm not much of a rom-com watcher. Unlike others of its ilk, though, this flick wisely admits that relationships aren't all rainbows and butterflies, but that they are complicated, confusing, messes that aren't necessarily all sorted out by the time the credits roll.

The premise is simple enough - the film claims:

""If a guy says he'll call and doesn't, he's not in the hospital with a broken number-dialing finger; he's just not that into you"".

After a mediocre first date with pre-recession real estate agent Conor (Kevin Connolly), the film's main protagonist Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), over zealous for date success and naively optimistic as ever, is certain that she has found Mr. Right. But when he doesn't call, her friends (Jennifer Aniston as Beth and Jennifer Connelly as Janine) comfort her with assurances of his interest and case studies of how they knew someone who knew someone in the exact situation - and it worked out for them, of course!

Not that Beth or Janine are living it up in the mansion of romantic bliss, mind you. Aniston's character has been living with Neil (Ben Affleck) for seven years, and for five of the seven, she's been dying to know why he won't pop the question. Wholly against the institution of marriage, though, Neil says that he's totally committed to her and he doesn't need a piece of paper to prove...yadda, yadda, yadda.

Connelly's character Janine on the other hand is married. Happily? Not so much. Ben's (Bradley Cooper) baby blues are soon tempted toward blonder waters when he meets Anna (Scarlet Johansson) at a convenience store one fine evening; how convenient. Too bad he's married, he reasons.

Drew Barrymore easily plays Mary, Anna's friend. Her role is pretty forgettable; but then she did spend most of her time producing the movie.

Justin Long plays Alex, the woman conquering bar owner who decides to school Gigi in the thinking of men, no feelings spared.

For the most part the story lines are tied together in believable ways and it's interesting to watch just how they're all connected - kind of like 6 degrees of separation.

A tough pill to swallow:

Perhaps too realistic at times, ""He's Just"" exposes the well-intentioned way we women attempt to comfort our spurned friends - not with assurances that despite her many attractive qualities, the guy just isn't interested for one reason or another. Instead, we assure our friends that there is no way he could be uninterested.
Really ladies, if you suspect that your friend is dating a guy who can't see her true worth, before you swell her head with an idealized, irresistible image of herself, please take her to see this movie, and let her do some soul searching. The film will do all the talking for you without patronization.

Be warned:

It's hardly a date movie (unless you want to end the date by breaking up when the scales have dropped from your eyes and you realize that you're more ""into"" the relationship than your significant other).

Best performances from: Jennifer Connelly as Janine who is more obsessed with the idea that her husband is smoking behind her back than that he is having an affair. Ginnifer Goodwin too has earned her keep. Her embarrassing attempts at securing ""the one"" are so realistic you will likely find yourself reddening at the all too familiar lengths to which she goes.

Best line from the movie: Listen out for the line the guy uses who ends up with Gigi (won't say who ;-)), it could be the ""You complete me"" of the 21st century!

This film may cause some discomfort. Side effects are generally mild and may include feelings of embarrassment over previous postdate obsession/stalking.

3149670,2,B00164KYV4,"I was not terribly in to HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU (HJNTIY).  As a sum total, it was a moderately enjoyable movie, yet oddly I found it to be poorly cast/acted, and full of clichs.

HJNTIY follows various relationships among people who all either know each other, or are separated by only a degree or two at most.  We see people falling IN love, people falling OUT of love.  Some couples do both.  Some characters seem to do neither.  And naturally, most things wrap up in a satisfactory manner at the end.  It's told in loosely interwoven scenes.  The easiest comparison I can come up with is to say it's like a NYC version of LOVE, ACTUALLY.  Although I enjoyed LOVE, ACTUALLY a whole lot more...mostly because many of the performers gave energetic, committed performances, including the drop-dead funny Bill Nighy, the droll Hugh Grant and the exceedingly witty and down-to-earth Emma Thompson.

If I had to pick a ""star"" of HJNTIY, it would probably be Ginnifer Goodwin (who is fabulous on TV's BIG LOVE).  She gets the most screen time.  Her character is a young woman whose very eagerness to land a man causes her to drive them away.  She is also utterly unable to decipher the signals men are sending her, and is really the character for whom the title is meant.  She forges a friendship with bar owner Justin Long, who guides her through the ""code"" of understanding text messages, voice mail,  pick-up lines and brush-off lines.  Goodwin throws all her energy into the part, and the result is an annoying character...it's easy to see why men run from her.  Yet I had to give her credit for her efforts.  At least she was trying.

On the other end of the scale was poor Jennifer Connelly.  It's now been a scarily long time since she's had a good part or really turned in a memorable performance.  I had high hopes a couple of years ago for her appearance in LITTLE CHILDREN, and though she acquitted herself okay, the nature of her role didn't help her and then Kate Winslet just flat-out out-performed her.  She is not a natural for comedy, and she mostly looked worn out and disinterested.  Justin Long was right there as well...he looked 10 years older than the last time I saw him...frankly, he looked a little unhealthy, and he certainly appeared to be uninterested in building a relatable character.

In between we had Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck as a couple that's been together happily for years, but Affleck just won't pull the trigger on the marriage thing.  Gee, a man who's ""against"" marriage??!?!  I've NEVER seen that in a movie before.  All their scenes were charming, because these two actors are endlessly affable...but there was no real sizzle.

Scarlett Johannssen reaffirmed her limited range. Obviously she's a stunning young lady, but with each passing role, she becomes more and more affectless and listless.  She's frequently paired with Bradley Cooper, who I am HUGELY tired of seeing in any way, shape or form.  I just don't get the appeal...he seems utterly incapable of being likeable.  He convincingly plays a cad in this film, but really never makes us sympathize with him.

Also, the film underutilizes Drew Barrymore...but I suspect that her character, had she been given more screentime, would have been unlikeable too...a rare feat for the always breezy and fun Barrymore.

Again, the awkward tapestry all these characters wove was mildly entertaining throughout, and when we left the theatre, I was pleased enough to chalk it up as a ""win.""  But with merely 5 minutes reflection, I realized that there was very little work in the movie that was worthwhile, and I believe that HJNTIY will soon fade from memory.

The film MIGHT be a good ""date night"" rental...but why not watch WHEN HARRY MET SALLY again?  Or heck, even LOVE, ACTUALLY!",1235520000,5,3785,4.76036866359447
3149671,5,B00164KYV4,"I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan. I also love Jennifer Connelly and who doesnt love cute as a button Drew Barrymore? Here we find these lovely ladies all in different stages of love. Drew Barrymore works at a magazine with a bunch of homosexual guys who try to give her advice because she cant seem to get it right. Scarlett Johannson has a guy in love with her, but she has no interest as she likes a married man more. Jennifer Connolly seems satisfied in her married life until she finds it all to be a sham. Jennifer Aniston finds that she isn't really satisfied just living with a man for seven years and not being married. Then we have Gigi, she is the one actively looking for a man but being extremely clingy in the process. She finally gets some hints from Justin Long that she isn't what men are looking for, and she needs to change her plan of attack drastically.

Its a great movie. Its a coming of age romantic comedy set to the digital age that reminds us that love can be found when we least expect it. We do not have to change for a man. We also don't have to wait around for his call. Women can pick up the phone the same way. Excellent movie with an all star cast definitely worth seeing and worth owning.",1235001600,3,1222,4.222222222222222
3149672,3,B00164KYV4,"Gigi (Goodwin) is getting dating advice from Alex (Long).  Beth (Aniston) has been living with her boyfriend Neil (Affleck) for years, but he shows no signs of proposing marriage.  Janine (Connelly) and Ben (Cooper) are married and have just bought a new house; but Ben is cheating on her with Anna (Johansson).  Anna is currently seeing Connor (Connolly), but it isn't that serious.

Like ""Love, Actually"" before it, ""He's Just Not That Into You"" weaves multiple, related storylines together dealing with love and relationships.  Unfortunately, it does not do so as well, and runs about fifteen minutes too long.  There is a lot of star power here, and they do the best they can with what they are given, but only about half of the story lines work in any real way.  Still, there is enough here to entertain many.  This is best left for DVD if it must be seen.",1235001600,,861,4.655629139072848
3149673,3,B00164KYV4,"Five very likable couples that have some connection to one another traverse the choppy waters of romance in Baltimore. That's the short of the new romantic comedy - drama ""He's Just Not That Into You"". And it is an interesting, if entirely unoriginal idea. But the filmmakers take some good, interesting elements and make the story funnier and more enjoyable than it has a right to be.

In a film like this, with so many characters, a film attempting to make light of and dramatize the many aspects of romance, you know that every character is going to have one aspect of a personality. There are simply too many people for the writers and director to be able to delve into any of the characters in any depth. When the writers and directors have the skill to create more than a few real life, fully rounded, believable characters, you know you are in the hands of people with real talent. Usually, the end result is something magical. ""He's Just Not..."" is not magical, but it has a few funny moments. And these moments are made all the more enjoyable by the likable cast.

Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) are very much in love and have been together for seven years. But Beth wants to get married and Neil doesn't believe in it. Can Beth accept the status of their relationship and continue on, or will she jeopardize the relationship by insisting on marriage? Ben (Bradley Cooper) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly) are married, but aren't particularly happy. Janine seems to be more interested in renovating their house. When Ben meets Anna (Scarlett Johannson), a yoga teacher who wants to be a singer, he finds an undeniable attraction to her. But he doesn't want to jeopardize his marriage. But what if Anna is the love of his life? Mary (Drew Barrymore) works at ad sales for Baltimore's gay weekly and gets most of her dating advice from her gay co-workers. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), the film's guide, goes on a blind date with Conor (Kevin Connolly), a realtor. She is sure he will call back, but he is more interested in going out with Anna, a girl he is clearly infatuated with. Distraught, Gigi decides to visit a spot Conor told her he hangs out at, a restaurant owned by Alex (Justin Long), a womanizer who is also Conor's friend. He likes Gigi and decides to become her romantic guide.

So, it's all very predictable. But director Ken Kwapis (who has recently been directing episodes of ""The Office"") and writers Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein manage to generate a few laughs and make most of the characters at least interesting.

But all of this good will begins to evaporate. And evaporate very quickly. With five different 'couples', we have five different and distinct story lines. Yes, they overlap, but not a lot. So the film sets up a Round Robin-type of exposition. First we meet all five couples and learn why they are in this Rom Com Dram. The very broad strokes. Then, we start to explore their lives with them, delving deeper into the problems. Then we revisit them. Unfortunately, a lot of these 'visits' start to become very repetitive. A couple has an argument and then breaks up. We see the male living out of the apartment. We see the female unhappy. Will they get back together? Of course. But we have to sit through a number of scenes of each of them unhappy. What about Janine's discovery that Ben might be smoking. First, she accuses Ben. When he denies it, she turns to their foreman (Luis Guzman). She seems to accept the mystery of the cigarettes, but every time we see her, she either mentions them or looks at them or talks about them. This is used to illustrate the state of their relationship, but it really just illustrates the state of our fatigue at sitting in the theater for so long. Conor pursues Anna and wants to have a committed relationship with her. But she is attracted to Ben. And he can't sleep with her because it would affect his marriage. These three circle each other, engaging in various conversations. Soon, it really seems like some scenes are being repeated, almost verboten. And it becomes a chore to sit through the film.

A big part of the problem is the film is too long. Way too long, by like 30 or 40 minutes. At 129 minutes (it seems longer), this romantic comedy/ drama has too much time on its hands giving it the luxury to rehash stories and ideas we have already seen. If the film were, say, 90 minutes, a lot of this repetition would be impossible and the film would seem funnier (because the laughs would be more closely spaced together) and overall better (because everything would move at a faster pace.

Producer Drew Barrymore and her business partner Nancy Juvonen are smart producers. Adapting a 'self-help' book in to a fictional romantic comedy/ drama seems like an iffy proposition at best. But they clearly saw that it could work and adapting the former mega bestseller into a movie has now created a hugely popular movie going experience. Barrymore and Juvonen are also behind the ""Charlie's Angels"" films. So, they clearly recognize material that will draw people to the multiplex. It's too bad they can't recognize quality material and bring better films to the same legions of people so willing to drop $10 for a movie ticket.

Throughout the film, there are a number of moments when the screen flashes a line, presumably a bon mote of self-help gleamed from the bestseller. Then, we watch as a random person tells a quick story about their romantic life meant to illustrate this statement. Why are random people talking to us? Some of these moments are funny, but wouldn't it be a better idea to use the well-known actors you already have in the film for these moments? It would also help to make us more familiar with these same characters as we would get another little glimpse into their characters. Too bad. A wasted opportunity. As they stand, these moments only serve to make the film seem even longer.

""He's Just Not That Into You"" is a good date movie. But I would really recommend renting it on DVD and forcing your boyfriend to watch it with you at home. He will quickly become so bored he will agree to do anything for you. You could probably get him to clean the house, bake a pie, run the vacuum. Because it will quickly become apparent that He's Just Not That Into This Film.",1234915200,,6293,4.627573858549686

3149676,5,B00164KYV4,"I went with my best friend of 22 years.  It was like watching a movie of our lives in our single days.  We laughed out loud at all the stupid and embarrassing things the characters did and said in the movie - the very same things we said and did back in the day.  We sat by the phone waiting for it to ring, picked it up to make sure it was working, spent an eternity over drinks analyzing and picking apart everything the guy who never called said.  I think it was spot on.  I would not, however, recommend this as a dating movie - this is one for the girls' night out.  Enjoy, ladies!",1234137600,4,586,4.008620689655173
3149677,4,B00164KYV4,"It's not that often that you see a mainstream movie which draws groups of single women like moths to a flame.  Not surprising considering the movie's genesis from a phrase in one episode of Sex and the City, and the book of the same name.

Not that this would necessarily make a great date movie. It's more of a go see with your friend movie.

It boasts a promising ensemble cast with Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Ginnifer Goodwin, Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and others.

As we go deeper into the movie, we get caught up in the familiar stories and situations of these characters.  The central theme characters are played by Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love) as Gigi, and Justin Long as Alex (Live Free or Die Hard,and the Mac Guy from the tv ads), the wise bar manager with the knowing male perspective, who knows the dating code, and can tell instantly when he's not into her, and when she's not into him.

So he mentors Gigi, jilted and frustrated in love, a universal character most of us will recognise and perhaps empathise with. He even offers to set her up with his friend, but does Alex have feelings for her.

In contrast Conor played by Kevin Connolly from Entourage, plays the guy looking for the right relationship, yet inexplicably gets put back in the friend zone by Scarlett Johansson's character, but can he get out of that zone?

One of the biggest laughs comes when Jennifer Connelly's character breaks the mirror, and what happens next.

Most insightful is the long term relationship between Jennifer Aniston's and Ben Affleck's character, seven years together. If a guy says he does not want to ever get married, do you stick with him and hope he will change, or do you move on?

With Scarlett Johansson's slippery slope storyline, both sides of the story unfold, it does take two to tangle, and it is cautionary. Unfortunately, I have known a few restless guys like this guy.  It's not personal, it's just human nature.

One lesson from the movie could be whether women read too much into minor actions.  He said 'It was nice meeting you,' but what does that mean?  Does it mean he's interested, or is it merely a brush off. As Freud said eventually: Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar..

In contrast men do not pick up on minor signs, and so we tend not to give minor signs either. We tend to be obvious.  If a guy does not call, it means he's lost your number (it does happen), or maybe he doesn't feel he deserves you, or he's unavailable, which means he's just not that into you.

On the other hand if we are interested, we operate in a vacuum, because we cannot read the signs. So, how do we know if they are really into us. Then there's the fine balance of how often, and when to call.

If we don't conform to some preconceived idea of behavior this delicate flower of burgeoning attraction becomes overwatered and dies, or underwatered and shrivels. If we call and they don't call back, what does that mean?

So, we men are really in the same boat, aren't we?

I hope this is helpful.",1234051200,6,3049,4.539305301645339
3149678,3,B00164KYV4,"Is it the feel-bad movie of the year? Although it's disguised as a Valentine's Day chick flick, and the advertising tries to convince guys that it isn't filled exclusively with mushy stuff, it's certainly not fun-loving. Exposing, analyzing and patronizing complex relationships, He's Just Not That Into You is a startlingly relatable film that alternates between reasonably entertaining and ""drudging up bad memories."" It's more sophisticated than you might think and the humor, which is fairly consistent, doesn't resort to raunchiness. The dating crowd will want to take note, however, that this isn't the type of movie you want to watch with your significant other, as you'll both probably leave feeling guilty, paranoid, overly inquisitive, or all three.

The film follows several relationships, each one originally independent of the other, until they all seem to collide at the conclusion. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) assumes the stereotype of the pathetic, desperate girl, who obsessively waits for her many dates to call her back. She resorts to begging, stalking, and other degrading acts to win the attentions of multiple guys, each one shrugging her off. Alex (Justin Long), a friendly and experienced bar manager, steps in to give Gigi a few pointers on her depressing failure with the opposite sex. Relying too heavily on his advice and his playful concern, she starts to think Alex is interested in her, leading to even more angst. Their story is the most interesting, considering Alex's often eye-opening advice and the humor in Gigi's failings.

Ben (Bradley Cooper) was rushed into marriage with his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and resultantly falls for the sensual flirtations of Anna (Scarlett Johansson). After a quick seduction, Ben realizes he's destroying the relationship with his wife, but Anna is fixed on the idea that Ben could be her true love. Meanwhile, Conor (Kevin Connolly) is wondering why Anna, who is his current girlfriend, won't sleep with him. This section of the film is the most serious, with tragic and emotional twists at every turn.

Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) have been happily in love for seven years, but when her younger sister announces wedding plans, Beth begins to question why she hasn't been proposed to. Neil doesn't believe in marriage, but Beth feels it's a necessity - leading to doubts, heartbreak and the most unlikely segment of the film.

There are an additional few love stories thrown in, each involving several of the characters from the major three plot lines. Perhaps the most inspiring piece of He's Just Not That Into You is the storytelling approach, which carefully intertwines almost every single character - by the end of the film, it's really just one complex story. The problem is that a series of serious relationships that are falling apart, getting glued back together, or never having a chance to develop, is occasionally not varied enough to keep audiences amused.

The large and recognizable cast is delightful to see, introducing a new familiar face every ten minutes, and the humor is universal and doesn't resort to cheap yucks. The film puts on display every single stereotype, mold, rule, exception, and dilemma of relationships; some are predictable while others are surprising, but the whole spectrum is present. Told chiefly from a woman's perspective (guys are terrible and dishonest most of the time, although at certain points the men get their more unbiased viewpoint portrayed) He's Just Not That Into You is likely to rub a great many people the wrong way. It's not a date movie by any means, but it's also not as unintelligent as it appears.

3149746,1,B00164KYV4,"Review of He's Just Not That Into You
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? It reminded me of one of those Garry Marshall films named after a holiday with all-star casts, each on the screen for about ten minutes, and each luring hopefully enough people to the theaters on opening weekend to make up the cost of their salary. Only, instead of an incredibly goopy layer of cheese mixed in with each vignette, Hes Just Not That Into You is dipped in cynicism and hopelessness.

Why would anyone want to go see a movie in which several couples and hopeful couples try like Hades to make their relationships work, only to have infidelity, cruelty, and general disinterest get in the way? Even during a man-bashing girls weekend with Cosmos and chocolate, I cant imagine enjoying this two-hour smear of searching for love.",1497225600,2,855,4.618421052631579

I remember cringing at some points in the film because you kind of know how things are going to play out and I am not one who likes to see people walk into an embarrassing situation or make a fool of themselves.

Too bad this simple point has not been reasoned out by the younger generations.  There is a lot to be said for taking it slower.  Whatever happened to courtship?",1428883200,,405,4.220779220779221

As we mature, we go through a number of stages when it comes to relationships.  We meet people whom we like and are compatible with, and we meet people we like but just aren't a good match.  Sometimes we meet people we think are 'the one', and sometimes they are, well, just not into you.

This is a good comedy-drama, that manages to hit a lot of good notes.  The acting is good and I especially enjoyed the Ben Affleck-Jennifer Aniston relationship.

3150211,5,B00164KYV4,"I've had a crush on Jennifer Connelly since I saw her in the Labyrinth.  The mature version is still appealing.  The pleasant surprise is how realistic the experiences of these fictional characters are analogous with every-day life.  Then there were the pop-up interviews and side line (friendship) psycho-analysis, where the daily associates basically eviscerate any pretensions that our heroines might be clinging to.  (Like playing phone tag, and voice-mail tag, and e-mail tag, and texting, and my-spacing and only to get rejected by all these different technologies!)

It's absolutely glorious to watch a non-religious comedic romance drama that etches out the premise (and sticks to it), that workable conjugal relationship always depends on putting the beloved other ahead of our own selfish impulses.  Not to mention highlighting the chaotic norm that what we most yearn for and need, usually isn't on the greener, grassier, other side of the fence, but inexplicably, directly in front of us.

3150264,3,B00164KYV4,"Hes Just Not That Into You is billed as a romantic comedy but it might better be considered as a romantic drama.  It is a little too real, a little too painful to be in the same class as the lighter, fluffier, funnier efforts like the recent What Happens In Vegas.  The new to me actress Ginnifer Goodwin is at the center of the interlocking stories in the movie.  She is too obsessed, too insecure and too desperate to be much fun.  All of the women in the movie, it is a movie by and for women, are a trifle too driven to find true love.  It makes them crazy.
 The ensemble cast is super.  Ben Affleck proves he can actually act a part in what I think is his best role ever.  Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore and Scarlet Johansson all do an exceptional job.  Jennifer Connelly has perhaps the most challenging acting assignment and is well on top of the task.  She is the only married woman in the story and must portray a woman betrayed but game to stick it out.
 Justin Long (the Apple guy in the long running commercials on TV) shows that he has the chops to be a romantic lead.  Kris Kristofferson has a small role as Anistons dad.  All of these actors do a terrific job and it is a pleasure to watch them.
 For me, a romantic at heart, there was too much focus on the down side of love, the betrayals, misunderstandings and the unbearable pain of love gone wrong.  But it is very well done, and there are uplifting and funny parts to provide balance.
 It is number two this week at the box office, bringing in a tidy $62million world wide so far.  The PG-13 film runs two hours and nine minutes.  With three saw blades, this is not the top banana in the genre, but the great performances make it worth seeing.",1414713600,,1716,4.243827160493828

3150340,4,B00164KYV4,"I think everyone dating should watch this! Love in the beginning when the girl's mom tells her that the little boy is mean to her because he likes her, what an ah-ha moment for some of our behavior as adults!",1400112000,,208,4.225

3150358,4,B00164KYV4,The plot is funny and poignant at times.  I enjoyed the quirkiness of some of the characters.  They all seem very authentic and real.

3150360,1,B00164KYV4,The main female characters in the movie bend over backwards for the males in the story and the males give no effort.  All the women who ended up with someone only did because the man just knocked of their boot. This movie portrays women as the one who do the dirt word in a relationship while the men just show up when they feel like it. Which is not at all how real relationships are. Both parties should be working hard and willing to make sacrifices.,1396656000,2,453,4.267441860465116

3150365,4,B00164KYV4,This movie had a ton of good actors in it and it was a story line with several couples trying to cope with or find love.  It put me off on ever wanting to find romance.,1394841600,,168,3.6666666666666665
3150366,4,B00164KYV4,It was a fun movie about the way women and men interact. The misconceptions and differences in language. It's not exactly romantic but has some of that too. It's somewhat like a slice of live story. Women will be the most entertained by this material though some men can also find it interesting.,1394409600,,296,4.60377358490566

3150382,5,B00164KYV4,It is about a group of people that have different experiences with romantic relationships.  It helps them to see that 'friendship' is the beginning to all real solid romantic relationships.  Each character in the story realizes something about either the relationship they have or the relationship that they hope for that ultimately helps them connect with someone they had not expected to be what they are actually looking for in a romantic relationship.  It helped them face some realities about their romantic relationship and determine if it is a healthy one.  The end result is everyone finds happiness or an opportunity to look forward to it.,1393632000,,648,5.084905660377358

3150436,2,B00164KYV4,"I love romantic comedies, and this style in particular. But most of the relationships seemed either excessively superficial and more than a little whiny. But what devastates the rating was the Jennifer Aniston storyline. Spoiler alert, but it's important to understanding why this movie is not good. That relationship has been going on for years and is fine, except that she wants to get married at some point, and he doesn't see the point in marriage. This turns into a big conflict and they break up over it. Here's the part that gets me: Jennifer Aniston's character comes back telling herself that she's actually okay with staying with the guy and not getting married even though it's what she wants. She gives up the thing that she wants for this guy. Yes, it's true that afterward he proposes, but it doesn't change the how incredibly selfish he is. She cares about getting married and he doesn't care. If he doesn't care, why can he not just go through with it since it matters to her? A refusal to do something your partner cares about when you don't care is nothing but selfish. And this movie tries to romanticize that. Dreck and drivel.",1383868800,,1147,4.683168316831683

3150449,3,B00164KYV4,"Romantic comedies are tough - no matter - in this postmodern, cynical world.  This one tries its very best, with an all-star A list cast, but ultimately it's a talkfest without any real surprises or treats to satisfy viewers.  Nothing bad about it but, then again, nothing very memorable. For $1.99 it's basically eye-candy.  Only one noteworthy performance: Jennifer Connolly is so unlikeable she should sue her agent for putting her in a frothy romantic comedy where she's clearly a fish out of water.",1382918400,,503,4.964285714285714
3150450,5,B00164KYV4,I love each of the relationship stories. It's not the kind of love stories you see in movies that doesn't happen in real life. This movie relates to real life. I've watched it so many times. Most favorite movie!,1382054400,,211,4.435897435897436

3150452,3,B00164KYV4,"This was billed as a comedy. I found the stories compelling. However, the situations that the characters found themselves in were just sad and pathetic, not at all funny to me.

3150455,1,B00164KYV4,"This film is terribly written, in particular the annoying and cliche ""direct-to-audience"" segments. This film is full of cliche's about how people behave, especially single women. Apart the excellent, and completely-wasted, cast of talented actors, there was little of value here. In fact, I'm surprised this film was funded since it offers absolutely nothing new to the genre or to life. WASTE of TIME!",1378512000,,403,5.3125

3150473,5,B00164KYV4,"I hate chick flicks. Seriously. I take more pride out of the fact that my first blu ray purchase was Rambo. A girlfriend of mine forced me to sit through this the first time by withholding popcorn and kettle chips. Smart girl.
I've watched this several times since, by choice, on my own. It's just an honestly funny movie about dating and relationships. It spans all through first dates to marriage, from hot, artsy chicks to girls next door, suave guys to pricks. There are sketches during random parts of the film of impromptu moments of regular people (and famous people) commenting on a particular theme- ""when she won't sleep with you..."" and things like that. Genius. It's a great way to make the film even more tangible on a realistic level.
I'm not the biggest fan of some of the actors in this, but the writing and directing of this far surpass any issues I have with actors. So even if you hate the color pink, or refuse to drop your metallica collection from your ipod, just take a night and watch this, even if it's in private. If you've ever had even the mildest bump in a relationship, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.",1374796800,2,1145,4.509615384615385

Every actor is hand-picked for their role and plays it to the hilt, subtle when called for but over the top when needed.  Ginnifer Godwin's character is the lead and she draws you in...very engaging and hopeful.  She aches for someone to love and someone to love her, and no matter how many times she tries and misses, she still tries.  She meets Justin Long's character who seems to be the first honest man she's met.  Their friendship is the leading plot in the movie that has a lot of subplots...all of which are fun, fascinating character studies.

The list of excellent actors in ""He's just not that into you"" goes on and on.  The acting, as well as the writing, is wonderful.  I won't bore you with my rendition of the stories, but I will highly recommend this movie!",1372032000,,855,4.542483660130719

Gennifer Goodwin was adorably fantastic in this movie and she makes you want to never give up on finding love. I also loved Ben and Jen's chemistry in this film, they felt like a real couple to me.
So if you are looking for a nice movie to kick up your feet to after a long day of work and you just want to relax and eat some popcorn, then this is the movie for you.

3150517,5,B00164KYV4,Don't know why and can't explain exactly why this is one of my favorite movies of all time! Maybe it's because there is so much truth to the movie and the different characters convey the different situations women go through while dating or a difficult marriage. the different women that tak to the camera about their own personal situations in-between the movie scenes are hilarious and absolutely the truth!

3150526,3,B00164KYV4,"After all the hype that was behind the book- this movie was a let down.

Right as the movie begins we are introduced to lots of characters ( with very well known Hollywood names).

Get the scorecard- but only if you think you are going to care about keeping track of these couples, or people trying to couple.

After you meet them all, you then get to learn about their relationship problems.

Problems that we should care about, but don't.

 Well, for me that  was a bad sign right off the bat.

I don't have any interest in these characters or their issues.

 Why am I watching this again?  Is this movie going to get any better?

 Yawn- ho- hum.....Who has the chips bag? Pass me the soda will ya?

Oh, yeah back to this movie.

If you think this is going to be as humorous as the book or audio recording of the book- forget it.

In the mood for a rom-com?

This is not it.

 It's not funny and with the exception of one couple in the plot, it is not romantic either.

It is also a chick flick.  CHICK FLICK. NOTHING IN IT FOR THE MEN. NOTHING- ZERO- ZIPPO- NADA.

EXCEPT FOR CATCHING A FEW ZZZZZZSSSSS BECAUSE THEY ARE BOUND TO FALL ASLEEP IF YOU PUT THIS ON.

 Guys don't dig most chick flicks- but a really bad chick flick, is up there with other forms of male torture.

So there you  have it- not funny,romantic, interesting and definitely not worth your time or money.",1366329600,,1376,4.236434108527132

3150546,5,B00164KYV4,"This is one of my favorite romantic movies.  I think Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ONCE-UPON-A-TIME/dp/B005XN3150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ONCE UPON A TIME</a>) is amazing here, Ben Affleck too, everyone in top form, including Bradley Cooper, though playing an unlikable character, and charming Justin Long as Ginnifer Goodwin's love interest (Long played the nerdy teen advising Tim Allen & Sigourney Weaver via communicator-""Just push the blue button!""- in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest/dp/B007QA3AH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest</a>). Though there are multiple stories told, the characters are well-developed, in relation to each other, in many pithy, seminal scenes.  Great, natural dialogue.

Personally, I think this movie superior to LOVE, ACTUALLY- more natural, less contrived.  Note, for example, the great subtlety and yet significance of the scene in which Bradley Cooper declines Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette.  Another reason I love this is the strong chemistry between all the characters, friends as well as lovers.  And the ending- where all the loose ends are tied up- not just one happy ending but several- perfectly punctuated by Keane's marvelous ""Somewhere Only We Know"", followed by the Cure, wonderful (the music throughout the film is great).  And be SURE to stay tuned for the credits, because the movie continues for a few minutes after they begin to roll, indeed, some of the best scenes.

I read a few of the negative reviews and on reflection, I must say that I didn't find this movie funny either- honest, charming and moving, yes- funny, no.

I enjoyed the deleted scenes, hearing the director's rationale for deleting them.  They would've detracted from the flow, true, but provide great backstory so watch them if you like the film (btw, the one with Scarlett Johannson singing in the cocktail lounge appears to have been filmed in the Observation Bar on the Queen Mary).  There's an entire subplot involving Johansson's character, with Theresa Russell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Widow/dp/B00AGE5P0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Widow</a>) playing her mother- intriguing, and very interesting why director Ken Kwapis decided to cut it.  Only one small quibble do I have about the movie, and that involves being taken aback by some of the awful hair styles sported by the women (Goodwin and Johansson in particular), and in some cases, poor makeup (and/or lighting).  Granted, everybody doesn't have to look perfect all the time, but it's quite a feat to make these beautiful women look haggard, as they do in several scenes (not Goodwin, she's radiant, it's her hair that's atrocious).  But that's minor- this movie has romance, heart, charm, and wisdom, in my humble opinion.  Granted, it's not exactly a feminist manifesto, but even so, it makes some VERY incisive observations about relations between the sexes.  I dare say a large percentage of people in this world spend an inordinate amount of time looking for someone to love and love them, the central theme of the film.

There was one misstep in that in one scene Johannson storms out of Ben's office without bothering to put her dress back on, that might have raised a few eyebrows.  Lastly, I would have found it satisfying had Jennifer Connolly ended up with Javier, but that didn't happen, darn it.  I think you'll find this well worth your time, and you won't soon forget the characters and what happens to them.",1364342400,2,3614,5.634686346863469

It is an all around great film about relationship building, finding love and having the support of family and friends all in a silly & sometimes whacky environment but it all makes sense. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" will make you laugh or possibly cry because the characters are believable and likeable with the extreme capability of drawing you into their troubles.

Otherwise, you are a ""right now"" type of girl. This movie shows how both sexes act around the opposite sex. Normal (yet irrational) behavior that you or your friends have done all of a sudden seem clear. ""You are not the exception; you are the rule.""",1358553600,,511,4.171717171717172

The movie was set up such that it supposedly offered advice to single women regarding single men. Personally, I thought the movie was insulting to single people, in general, and especially to single women. I can say this because I was a single person for over 50 years beyond puberty until I finally got married. Believe me, I know what the single life is like. I actually felt sorry for the very attractive single women depicted in this movie and I felt embarrassment at the depiction of the men. A comedy? Maybe a laugh track was needed so that the audience could tell when it was supposed to be funny.

The production values of the film were fairly high. The photography was good. The sound track was okay. The acting of most of the characters was actually fairly good to excellent in a lot of places. Unfortunately, the cast was burdened with a pathetic story line. Almost every cliche of single life was dwelled upon at length. The movie was boring and embarrassing at the same time. I longed for the end. This DVD will go into the trash. I couldn't bear watching it again and I would never lend it to a friend for viewing.

The movie is populated with the pathetic women who just talk and talk about their relationships or the lack of them, and are needy, desperate, and super-annoying. Infantile men, scary of commitments or those who are in the relationship but could not remember why they actually wanted to be in one. Plus, it has nothing to do with the comedies. It is totally not funny and anti-romantic. Just imagine Sex and the City with no sex, Love, actually with NO Love at all, actually, and When Harry Met Sally with the main characters absolutely unlikable and lifeless. I finished watching the whole thing hoping that it would improve and give me something to like in it. The only story that I found a notch better than the rest was that of Neil and Beth (Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck), who have been together for seven years, love each other but are not married because Neil does not believe in marriage. Both actors were convincing in the story that was not as annoying as the rest of them.

But for the most of the time, I was not into the movie's characters at all. I read the plot of the movie in Wiki and in writing it does not look as irritating and boring as the film. Then I found out that the film was based on the bestselling book by two Sex and the City scribes (that explains the similarities between two), Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. I read some of it and liked it a lot.  So, what went wrong with the movie?  Were the actors trying too much) or 2+ hours running time was way too long? As the result, the movie is simply lifeless and plain with no sparks or romance, and, sadly, even the all-stars cast could not save it.",1324944000,2,1832,4.347953216374269

Just when we feel like we are getting it, the movie abandons all that to mostly happy endings with reluctant guys coming completely around to total commitment of love. Some of the characters don't quite go that way, and there is some good acting. Many of the turns make no sense, like Ben Affleck's change of heart. He has no problem with commitment, but strongly is against marriage. What does he do when Aniston pines for him, but won't be with him without getting married? You guessed it Hollywood, he asks her to marry him! We never get to see the complexities of him selling out on his beliefs or overcoming whatever created them, he just does it and she's happy. Playboy Justin Long's sudden realization that he's in love with Gigi ain't romantic, it's just ridiculous. Furthermore, we never get to see any reason Bradley Cooper would even like his wife, as she's just one-dimensionally dour. This he is just not into it at all.",1324080000,,1106,4.6479591836734695

The film is bogged down by the fact that there's too much going on for the characters to emerge as three-dimensional personalities, thus reducing its talented thespians to playing stereotypes.",1320969600,,646,5.281553398058253

Anyway, any movie where Drew Barrymore says ""He 'My Spaced' me"" cannot be taken seriously.

3) She can't find anyone that likes her, but the guy she consults ends up falling for her.

In other words, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU stars every Generation Xer in Hollywood--with the exception of Ashton Kutcher.  Why Ashton lucked out, one can only wonder.

Here we have a meandering, colossal ensemble of intertwining story lines and sub-plots--all having to do with how miserable love makes us.  What sends this film to terminal yawn status has to do with the sheer number of story lines and sub-plots; after half an hour the viewer just becomes exhausted trying to keep up with all of them.  If I had had a vote (which I didn't) I would have promptly jettisoned the Connelly-Cooper-Johansson love triangle, as none of the three characters are remotely likable.  (I heard a Wicked Witch of the West cackle every time Connelly appeared on screen; can we say the word ""severe""?)  The most interesting story line centers around Goodwin's hard luck character falling for Long's character--who views their relationship as purely platonic.  Or does he?  Or do we really care?

Don't answer that.

Legions of actors--bushels of story lines.  Best take notes, or keep a score card, if you can even get into HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU.

3150709,2,B00164KYV4,"Overall, this movie did not translate well from book to screen because the dramatic hit home of the lessons was lost in a poorly written and executed story.
I read the book several years ago, and found myself hugely disappointed it hadn't  been written when I was much much younger because it would have saved me a lot of wasted energy on the wrong men (or at least a lot of them).
The movie followed five different women with brief follows on three of their men, some of them friends with each other, and their relationships or lack of, and issues with men.  I understand the idea of using female characters to relay the messages. However, I found the implementation of that, sort of a let down.  A lot of the lessons were lost.  I wasn't drawn in to the characters and their lives.  They seemed uninteresting, sort of wishy washy, and they did not truly evolve as chracters, which is the whole point of the story.
The one woman, who wants to get married, breaks up with her bfriend of seven years because he hasn't made the move towards marriage, ends up letting go of her marriage dream and gets back together with him.  So where is the lesson or real growth from her character?  Because I was confused.  Is it that she was too hung up on being married?  I don't know.  Didn't make sense to me.
So for me, this was a let down.  If you really want the lessons, read the book instead.",1292630400,,1385,4.3501945525291825
3150710,5,B00164KYV4,"Dating can be quite stressful considering all of the expectations and concerns each individual brings to every new relationship. For this reason, it is no surprise that many romantic comedies focus on helping viewers laugh at relationship complexities. The comic relief is nice and entertaining, but not usually insightful. In contrast, the movie, He's Just Not That Into You, with its all-star cast, is the most thought-provoking film in its genre.  Viewers glean insights from this film's many lessons on how to determine the level of interest in another person and how to evaluate one's own feelings about potential partners. The movie causes the audience to ponder why women sometimes tolerate being treated poorly by men, what constitutes a happy ending, and whether taking relationship advice from friends is a wise choice. The nine main characters lives are intertwined as friends, roommates, co-workers, and chance encounters, while representing various stages of relationships. The characters evaluate their current relationships and eventually learn that rules do not apply when other people's emotions are involved. Instead, they must realize their own worth and discover their individual needs and desires while waiting for a person who recognizes their worth and values it too. This movie helps people consider the balance that needs to exist between the random nature of relationships and pursuing goals with a purpose. Finally, the film urges people to avoid focusing on the fairy tale version of a happy ending, but rather on an ending that is right for them.",1292112000,,1575,5.325301204819277

It's a competent effort, but for me the casting was a bit dull, the writing fell short, and I wasn't engaged by any of the relationships explored.  It felt like a quick knock-off of ""Love Actually"".",1289174400,2,428,4.325
3150713,3,B00164KYV4,"HJSNTIY is a girl movie at heart, so I was biased from the get-go. However, as the film unfolded I found myself drawn in, like a puppy to a bowl of 'forbidden' food. The movie follows several different characters as they search for true love. One couple is married (Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper). One couple doesn't necessarily believe in marriage (Ben Afleck and Jennifer Anniston). Two girls just want to be a couple (Gennifer Goodwin and Drew Barrymore). Two guys also want to be couples, though they don't know it yet (Kevin Connolly and Justin Long). And then there's one girl (Scarlett Johansson) that's just disgusting in her actions. And that's not all of the stars that are in the movie, but you get the point.

Anyway, the film is basically a mosaic at first, presenting the viewer with a quote that happens to set the scene for what's coming up. This mosaic introduces you to the many, many different characters that are all indirectly inter-related. People start to date or fall apart or whatever. And then the second half of the movie throws the ""quote"" thing out the window and follows the choices the people have made.

My problem with this movie was that there were too many characters, or too many connections. I can handle that when it's presented over a long bout of time (like in Lost), but when it's crammed into a 2-hour spot it's too much. It's like A and B are together, but B falls for C, who happens to be with D, who is best friends with E. F and G are in a relationship, and G is B's best friend. H is looking for a relationship and gets help and advice from her co-workers, A and F. And that's not even half of it. I'm sure the creators used some sort of flow chart or matrix to work everything out. Overall, the plot was semi-interesting, but I only really cared about a few of the characters.

They are broken up for the majority of the film, and no one, including the actors played by Aniston and Affleck, are quite sure why.

3150731,2,B00164KYV4,"An all-star cast - Ben Affleck, Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Drew Barrymore, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long and Kris Kristofferson  - hits the skids in  ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" a supposedly insightful and epic look into the complex dynamics of man/woman relationships that could single-handedly turn members of both sexes off romance forever.

In this misguided endeavor (the only thing really clever about it is the title), it's hard to tell which gender comes off worse - the women, who are all portrayed as needy, insecure, controlling, man-hungry whiners, or the men, who are all inconsiderate, self-centered louts.  And this battle-of-the-sexes face-off goes on for a grueling two hours and nine minutes.

The specific details of the romantic roundelay the characters put us through doesn't really bear repeating here.  Suffice it to say that the actors do what they can with the material - the movie was written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (based on the novel by Greg Berhrendt and Liz Tuccillo) and directed by Ken Kwapis - and that most of the characters manage to see the errors of their ways in time for the obligatory happy ending (could that possibly qualify as a plot ""spoiler""?  Only if you have never seen a romantic comedy before, I suppose).  Barrymore does get off a few choice lines about how hard it is to date in a world dominated by email, cell phones, text messaging, voicemail, and a whole host of other technological gadgets that actually make communication MORE difficult rather than less so, but that's pretty much it in the laughs department.

And a couple of other points:  why is it that, in a movie that takes place in a modern urban setting, the producers couldn`t cast even one person of color in a major role (there are plenty of them in the background appearing as waiters, however)?  And what's with all the gay guys, with their limp-wristed affectations and ""You go, girl!"" theatrics?  Frankly, I thought we'd gotten past all that by this point.  It isn't even a matter of being politically correct; it`s a matter of creating a credible environment for the movie to tell its story in.

If you're interested in watching a genuinely great romantic comedy, skip ""He's Just Not That Into You"" and check out the 1967 classic ""Two For the Road,"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, and see how truly insightful and thoughtful a movie romance can be!",1266624000,4,2460,4.9106280193236715
3150732,3,B00164KYV4,"After being bombarded with The Rules, Sex In The City, a stream of romantic comedies and the like, we are at last seeing these principals in action.  ""He's Just Not That Into You"" has been yet another dating training film, and while we laugh at the mildly amusing we are supposed to see ourselves in these situations and change our behaviors.  It is a shame that we put ourselves in these situations, but not that funny that we really do delude ourselves into thinking that something will come of a man who is, simply, not that into us.

The funniest, and most pathetic, is that of GiGi, who shows up at a bar wanting to return some guy's pen in the hopes of seeing him again.  In a not so ironic twist, the bar owner, Justin Long, becomes her romantic interest even though she talks to him as if he is her therapist before he too rejects her and he inevitably realizes that he likes her as well.  Drew Barrymore is guided through her minor trials and tribulations by her army of gays, her funniest scene is when they listen to her botched voice mails from her MySpace antics.  Jennifer Aniston has been living with her boyfriend for the last seven years and he's simply ""not into marriage"", causing her much stress.  And Scarlette Johansen is having an affair with a married man, believing within that he will leave his wife for her while his wife, Jennifer Connelly, is at home suffering.  So here are the situations before all the hype.  It's rather painfully obvious that all are in situations where their men are just not that into them.  We as the audience know this, but they don't seem to.  It's kind of pathetic really.

This is more of a chick flick that shows the dating scene and married life as they ebb and flow with time and circumstance.  The stories are interesting and mildly funny.  The honesty factor in relationships is brought out with a sub-story on whether someone really quit smoking cigarettes.  We see the truth at the end of the movie.

3150750,3,B00164KYV4,"So it shipped off as a couple's movie, but the screen went black as a really weird movie.

Okay, there's an all-star cast, and I suppose they tried their best. The plot is weak and flickers half-heartedly, with little surges at a heart-touching moment ending up ruined. I felt like the director and the writers and everybody had a great idea, but it just got bogged down with weird plot twists and dull dialog.

I sat down to watch this movie, expecting something much more light and, well, romantic. It looks and sounds like a cute movie. Yet the humor they stab just ends up making us cringe, and the ""truths"" they sift in their about men and women are all, frankly, stupid and unrealistic.

The movie makes men look like disgusting dogs, and women look like lousy Bambi-eyed stupidheads, in a third grader's words. It had a heart, trust me, but it's just very bizarre. Like, let's watch a man fall in love with a not-so-innocent blond, or a hopeless girl fall in love several times, only to learn from a male friend that each one isn't interested, and gives her dating tips (which seems weird on its own). I mean, I feel like there's too many characters in an overly-complicated, weird plot that just doesn't click with me.

So if this is such a horrible movie, why did I rate it more than one star? Because it's honestly not a horrible movie. It started out good, but kinda degraded (it really lost me with the man-leaving-his-wife-for-the-younger-girl part). It has a few touching parts, granted, and though a nontraditional ending, it's still predictable and feels kinda hollow. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can watch it if you like, but don't buy it.

It is one of the first Romantic Comedy movies in a long time that I just smiled at the end.  There was a realness for me to the stories in the movie.  I think that so often people want to deny how many (not all) men and women are wired and what they do.  I've heard stories like the ones in this movie.  In fact, although my husband and I didn't live together before we got married and we met and married in 6 months, there is a scene in the movie that reminded me of just how my husband proposed to me.  A few weeks ago he was telling me about how he'd shared our story with someone and it sounded so romantic.  But, it was a long time ago and I hadn't thought of it that way in a long time.  But, this movie reminded me of why it was romantic.  The scene in this movie was romantic.

And I loved the ending.  A lot of people seemed to not like Gigi's character, but I've known a lot of women like her and when I was single, I know I wanted to call guys who didn't call.  I even got stood up twice by a guy once.  I genuinely thought he had just forgotten the first time.  I didn't really think he'd show up the second time.  It happens to everyone.  And I went on a lot of dates when I was single--I wasn't desperate or chasing any guys, but it does happen that you get stood up or misled.

I think one of the greatest strengths of this movie is that most romantic movies and books make it seem as if being married and in a relationship is the answer to everything.  The ending to this movie makes it clear in a good way that it's not.  My mom always told me that it's better not to be married, than to be married to the wrong person--she didn't mean that you should just leave someone if you're unhappy, but that just wanting to get married isn't a good reason to get married--if it isn't the right person.  She also gave me another piece of advice--that when you're on your own, you can't run away from yourself--you have to face who you are.

All that said, I did fast forward a few of the sex scenes because I just didn't want to watch them.  I just didn't enjoy watching Scarlett Johanssen's character and her storyline--I'm glad they deleted the scenes that they did.

Acting is good, the story moves fast and it's a pleasure to see such stars as Jennifer Anniston, Ben Affleck, Scarlet Johanson, Jennifer Connoly and Ginnifer Goodwin (of ""Big Love"") going through the ups and downs of trying to find love.

It's funny but it is very serious at times.  I laughed at the blunt, sometimes cruel behavior of men in this movie.  Yes I have done some of these things.  And I laughed at the behaviors of the women who just can't get it right.  Gigi was a little bit overboard though but I know people exist like that.  The one thing that stuck out in this movie was Scarlett Johansson's character.  I meet women like this every day.  I work with a ton of them.  She had a perfectly good guy, who adored her, standing right in front of her and she totally overlooked him.  I hear the same women complaining that they can't find a good guy meanwhile I know what they did.  It's a shame.  Sometimes people can't get out of their own way.  Good realistic romantic comedy.  It's not one of those clown funny movies with stupid antics and situations.  It's reality.  And that's what's funny about this movie.

I wish I would have went to the movies to see this. It was pretty good in my opinion.

In between getting songs for my iPod, I was glued to the movie. I wanted to see what happened to the broken-hearted girl. I wanted to see if she would ever get it right. I wanted to see if the guy who was almost forced into marriage would be less of a sleaze.

I'm sure there is nothing new I could say about this dating movie that hasn't been said before. So I'll just say that it's worth it in the end and if you are interested in watching people trying to date and work various things out in their relationships, then this is the movie for you.

Everyone seems to know everyone through a person or two. And some of them even leave ""dates"" for another in the next second.

I'd like to comment on all the beautiful casts like the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, rigid and hilarious (yes, she's hilarious!)  Jennifer Connelly and countless others but my heart must go out to Ginnifer Goodwin and I'm woman enough to admit that I have at one time or another went through what she goes through in the movie - which, of course, made me root for her even more (Watch the movie ladies and you'll know what I'm talking about).  This girl makes all the right mistakes but here's the big catch - it all ends well.  And it was so satisfying to see the happy ending especially after all the turmoil and torture of dating that Gigi goes through.  I'm being straight with you.  I've seriously seen  more romantic comedies than any other genres but I have never teared up at the end (like NEVER) until this one.  Highly highly recommended to the romantists out there.

3150777,3,B00164KYV4,"`He's Just Not That Into You' is proof positive that it takes more than good looks and star power to make a good movie.  It takes even more than talent, which all of these actresses actually have, to make a good movie.  It takes chemistry (haven't I said this before) and it takes at least a certain level of intelligence.  `He's Just Not That Into You' lacks a lot of chemistry, which is surprising considering the cast, and it also plays things rather ignorant, which creates a very stupefied film that fails to live up to what it promised to deliver.

It's funny, because the film thinks it's really smart; but it's not.

Instead of attempting to flesh out the real drama of finding that special someone, the film pretty much throws everything at us with reckless abandonment and hopes that something, anything, is going to stick.  You have the cheating husband, the `just friends', the desperately single leech, the `living together but never getting married' and then you have the men and women who filter in and out of their lives.  Some actresses (and or actors) grab a hold of their roles better than other, but overall the experience is far too sporadic and unorganized to make any real impact.

If you are looking at this film for any other purpose other than brainless entertainment then you should look elsewhere.

I didn't expect this movie to be genius, for it is a romantic comedy, but I did expect it to have some sort of guidance.  It just seemed rather haphazard the way they just through scenario after scenario at us and then claimed to resolve it all with the wise words of a womanizer (since when is Justin Long a womanizer?).  It just makes no sense.

And yet it was still, in some ways, enjoyable.

A whose-who of talented actresses line the cast; from the ever-so-lovely Scarlett Johansson to the underrated and totally lovable Ginnifer Goodwin to Hollywood A-listers Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Aniston and even Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, not to mention Ben Affleck, Kevin Connelly and new heartthrob Bradley Cooper.  Even Kris Kristofferson shows up here!  Of the cast, Aniston and Connelly take the acting cake for me; especially Connelly who understands how to infuse the right amount of humor into her despair to make her frustrated wife believable.  I really wish that Scarlett Johansson would stop getting typecast as the flirtatious man-eater.  Yes, she is the most beautiful woman on the planet and every man wants to `get' with her, me included, but she has so much talent that it is being wasted on roles beneath her.  Goodwin, I just adore, but here she is just annoying.  I think it is more her character, but she really could have made her character at least relatable.  She's just messy here.  Barrymore is underused (she is such a luminous presence I wish she were in everything) here, and the film almost seems uninterested in her.

If you want a brainless comedy that has some laughs, some tears and some entertainment value, or if you are a die-hard fan of any of the ladies in the cast, then by all means did in; but if you want something with a little more meat then you should look elsewhere.",1254960000,,3144,4.688524590163935
3150778,3,B00164KYV4,"First the good. This movie has some interesting characters that you end up caring about by the end. It's a watchable movie that has some engaging dialog and even some lighthearted scenes. It's supposed to center around signals people give off and the difficulties in relationships. It's done in a somewhat unique way by having narration that pokes fun of dating and relationship stereotypes between scenes. The story itself revolves around an ensemble of characters, many of whom are friends, relatives or colleagues of each other. There are a number of relationship story lines, some of which end up happy and some that don't. All in all this is a fairly well-acted movie that has basically no scenes that make you cringe.

All of this being said, there were a couple of things I didn't like so much about the movie. First of all, the initial scenes were a bit confusing because the characters and their relationships were not well-introduced. It took a while to sort out who was who. Second, with such a large cast, some of the story-lines and characters seemed almost peripheral and excessive. There was a whole subplot with a sister of one of the main characters that was not very well-developed or meaningful to the main plot. As with many movies like this, you wonder if maybe a few less subplots might have allowed the remaining ones to be a little better-developed. Finally, while this is par for the course in a romantic-type movie, you could see the results of a few of the story lines coming a mile a way. Probably the most engaging relationship is the one between the girl who has most of the issues and the bartender who is supposed to be not at all interested but becomes a good friend. It's fairly obvious in their first scene that they will end up together in the end and they do.

This movie is worth checking out if you like romantic movies. You will probably end up feeling like it was very similar to other movies you've seen, but it's still quite well-done and enjoyable.",1254528000,,1992,4.640226628895184

It seemed like real life situations. The women who wants to get married, the girl who wants to find the right guy, the cheating husband, and so forth.

3150780,1,B00164KYV4,"""He's Just Not That Into You"" is a sad statement about the independence and strength of the modern woman.

It's almost paradoxical that the female characters are so weak and dependent on the men because the actresses themselves are much more talented the actors are. The film featured Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connolly, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore to name a few. These characters seek to validate their self-worth through the approval of men. Sometimes the men are not so deserving, to say the least.

The point of the movie, and also the same-titled book, ought to be to empower women, to make them realize and accept that some men just aren't that into them. This doesn't mean they aren't valuable or worthy of male attention; it just means that it wasn't ""meant to be"" with a particular beau.

Several scenarios of the guy being not that into the girl included the typical: a cheating husband, a man in a long-term, committed relationship who doesn't believe in marriage and several men who just don't call.

However, all is not always as it seems on the surface. One of the above is actually into the woman he is with, but the for-once blatant advice of a girlfriend tells the woman otherwise. This straightforward advice appears to be a turning point in the movie, until another friend scolds the blunt one for, well, being so blunt. Her sudden epiphany dims as her friends suck her back into the apparent delusion which naturally accompanies feminity.

One redeeming quality of the movie is the role of Kevin Connolly as Conor. He himself is desperately in love with Anna (Scarlett Johansson), who in turn takes advantage of his affection yet refuses to commit because of her (despicable) interest in a married man. Her friend (Drew Barrymore as Mary) nudges along her affair saying, ""Oh, but what if you're soulmates?"" It is obvious throughout the movie that the relationships that ultimately work are the ones into which the couples put work. However, this nugget of wisdom is discarded for the much more audience-pleasing idea of soulmates and true love.

Speaking of work, the long-term relationships, Beth (Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck) and Janine (Connelly) and Ben (Bradley Cooper), deliver the most believably genuine emotions. But devotion will determine which one lasts and which one fails.

Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the epitome of the insecure, single woman. Her first-date nervousness and post-date phone obsession can certainly find audience sympathy. Gigi's character is endearing but also irritating in that she ignores the good advice she receives from Alex (Justin Long, the Mac guy) and continues to overanalyze the actions of every man she meets.

The relatively carefree Mary (Barrymore) and her three gay co-workers offer much-needed comic relief from the puppy dog disappointment of Gigi, the overt sexuality of Anna and the deeply painful emotions of Janine. Yet, another complaint: There were many gay supporting actors but no real homosexual relationships explored. Conor's prospective real estate buyers, a gay couple, seem to say that homosexual relationships are all about sex, completely throwing emotion out the door and perpetuating yet another stereotype.

Everyone pretty much gets a happy ending, whether that is the bliss of marriage, the fun of dating or the independence of single life. The audience, too, enjoys this typical ending, rarely considering the implied acceptance of traditional gender roles.

""He's Just Not That Into You"" perpetuates stereotypes, tells women that they're lucky when they become a man's ""exception"" and gives silent approval to the ""fact"" that most married men are only thinking about all the women they are missing out on.",1253923200,3,3712,5.130794701986755

3150785,1,B00164KYV4,"In ""He's Just Not That Into You"" you will see five women in Baltimore area - Anna (Scarlett Johansson), Beth (Jennifer Aniston), Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and Mary (Drew Barrymore) - seeking for true love in the intertwined tales of love and romance. The male stars include Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and Justin Long. The cast is impressive. Unfortunately, the characters they are playing are not.

All the characters in the film are stereotyped and underdeveloped, commonplace, almost a banality itself. What surprised me is, talented players like Drew Barrymore are so boring in most of the scenes, never being allowed to shine. Actually, most of the characters, males or females alike, come across as flat and simplistic. OK, but maybe that is the point of the film. There are lots of talks about love and relationship, but few of them are really funny or insightful. Maybe that's only me.

What really surprised me is that despite (or because of) the best efforts from the actors, some of the characters are annoying beyond belief. Take self-deluded Gigi, for example. She constantly ""misreads"" the signs of men and she is seen waiting for phone call we know she will never receive. Gigi's life consists of only one action, which is presented in an exaggerated, unfunny way, and is often painful to see. But suddenly, all her problems are solved so easily. Why don't they give her a chance, just for once, to act like a real person?

I think an ensemble story is the hardest kind of story to handle in film. Just casting Hollywood's A-list actors is not enough. Every character and his/her episodes must be equally engaging and you need special cinematic narrative skills. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is directed by Ken Kwapis who did a good job in his ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" but still he is no Robert Altman. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" needs much better director and screenplay writers.",1252368000,2,1957,4.870870870870871

3150799,3,B00164KYV4,"Ginnifer Goodwin always seems to play the girl who can't get (or keep) a man.  Witness her turns in Mona Lisa Smile and as the jilted first Mrs. Cash in Walk the Line.  Where does this typecasting come from?  Because Ms. Goodwin is absolutely adorable.  She does it again here, as the adorably named and (increasingly) desperate Baltimore single Gigi who wonders why promising first dates and bar conversations never lead anywhere.  Answer:  She's obsessing WAY too much.  Gigi works in the same office with Beth (Jennifer Aniston), whose live-in boyfriend (Ben Affleck) is marriage-phobic; and Jeanine (Jennifer Connelly) an uptight control freak married to a guy (Bradley Cooper) who's had ample time to regret being pushed into marriage with her.  So much so that his eye wanders to buxom (and easy) yoga instructor Anna (Scarlett Johansson) who hits on him in the supermarket.  Memo to Ms. Johansson:  We get it.  You are a sexpot.  You are also in danger of becoming a parody of yourself.  Oh, wait--that's already happened.  Anna is friends-with-benefits with Conor (Kevin Connelly) who had one date with Gigi and is not that into her. Rounding out the cast is ad salesgirl Mary (Drew Barrymore) and wise bartender Alex (Justin Long), who counsels Gigi to behave more like a guy and not take it all so personally.  Apart from observing that Long is nowhere near as appealing here as he is as Mac in the Mac/PC commercials, he and Barrymore grated on my nerves the least.  Then, Barrymore is barely in the movie.  I think I counted three scenes that made it into the film.  The rest is all very angsty, Thirtysomethingesque, except that all of these people are too self-involved to have children.  One wonders how a nonfiction self-help book evolved into a 'romantic comedy' (in quotes, because there's not much that's either romantic or funny here) with all these different storylines.  A bit more entertaining than I was expecting it to be, which is faint praise, maybe, but that's all I got.  Women can take away the one salient lesson they need to learn, though:  When he's just not that into you, the signs are clear.  As crystal.",1249948800,,2140,4.818681318681318
3150800,1,B00164KYV4,"With all this talent one would expect something great. After seeing many negative reviews, I hoped for at least something good, but got something dreadful. I kept trying to find something to like about this movie as I normally love Jen Anniston, but even she couldn't save this clunker. Her character, along with Affleck's, were the best out of the bunch. Theirs was the most genuine and realistic out of all the ""love"" situations. I found Goodwin's character absolutely obnoxious. Who in real life would be that insecure and needy? Any man in his right mind would run from that. Especially a womanizer who had his share of beautiful women and then he unknowingly falls for her afer she attacks him on the sofa? Gag me. As for the love triangle between Scarlett's character and two men, how cliche. Of course the femme fatalle would be played by a busty blonde. Then there is Connelly's portrayal of a pathetic wife who only snared her husband by giving him an ultimatum and then refusing to sleep with him. Upon finding out about is infidelity she accepts it quite calmly until she further discovers he is sneaking cigarettes. Sneaking sex is acceptable, but he could get lung cancer!!  Then there is Drew Barrymore's air-headed character of a modern day woman who can't figure out how to communicate with all the different technologies in today's world. I had to roll my eyes throughout much of this film as these women were a bunch of one dimensional, pathetic whiners made to look weak, needy and less than. Real women are not like this, at least the ones I know. Thank goodness.  What surprises me most is that all these A-list actors signed up for this vapid drivel in the first place. Musta have been a heck of a paycheck. I guess the moral of this film is that as a society we, as women, are programmed to believe that a man likes us if he treats us badly.

I really liked the beginning with the realization of how girls are truly programmed to believe that if a boy treats her badly, he 'really likes her and is just hiding it.' No wonder so many women stay in unhealthy relationships - not trying to preach but it really is a no brainer about how we brain-wash ourselves and our friends to feel better, when we really are not helping anyone at all.

The movie tackles dating and couples full force. It allows the characters to each go through different elements of the process and though it categorizes each one without a lot of room to change,(the neurotic female on the prowl, waiting for the call; the puppy dog male whose love is not recipricated but taken advantage of; the girlfriend waiting, not so patiently, for an engagement ring) change actually does occur. Each character has his/her own epiphany about relationship and his/her role in the failure or success.

This movie is a good friends movie, as you will want to talk about it during and after, to compare your own memories with what you saw on screen. I liked the ending, as there was closure. Not all is good, which I believe is more accturate than a fairy tale, happily ever after.

3150807,4,B00164KYV4,"This is an ensemble piece with three different couplings-uncouplings at its core.  The two which were quite good and enjoyable are those with Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly).  The one I didn't like or believe was Beth (Jennifer Aniston).

I don't get the popularity of Jennifer Aniston in the movies.  I find her completely unconvincing both in this movie and her other movies.  It has gotten so bad for me with her that I now skip any movie she is in.  The only thing more tiresome than her movie romances are her real world romances.  Because I like Goodwin and Connelly a lot though, I couldn't skip this movie. Aniston is why this film lost a star for me.  I found her romance with Affleck totally unbelievable and I couldn't picture these two getting married.......ever.

Otherwise, the moral of the movie is, ""If a guy says he'll call and doesn't, he's not in the hospital with a broken number-dialing finger; he's just not that into you"".  There is so much truth in this statement and also in the accompanying statement that we woman do not want to hear this truth.  We also don't want our gal pals to hear it so lie to them about how ""he must really be into her"".  Ha!

At the opposite end of the spectrum is the movie's heart, Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin).  I've been watching Goodwin on  BIG LOVE on HBO and she has been quite good in that series as a polygamous Mormon wife. Gigi is the one who wears her heart on her sleeve and usually scares the guys off.  Making things worse, her best friends, Aniston and Connelly, always convince her that the guy must really be into her and that he will call.  They should instead be telling her to wear her heart less on her sleeve and not to be so optimistic.  You worry though that if they did tell her this that she might lose a good deal of her charm and appeal. A street wise bar owner (Justin Long) sets her straight on why and when she will not hear back from certain men.

It is easy to believe that Jennifer Connelly is the one with an Oscar for her acting as she has the toughest role in the movie.  Her husband is having an affair.  Connelly provides many dimensions to being the wife in a marriage worsening scenario.  She even develops a tic, she becomes obsessed with discovering whether he is smoking on the sly.

This movie convinces you that maybe the kindest thing you can do is tell your women friends, ""he's just not that into you,"" on a regular basis so they remove the scales from their eyes and get on with the business of living their lives and maybe being able to see when ""he is that into you"" as the truth.

3150812,4,B00164KYV4,"""He's Just Not That Into You"" uses comedy to paint a chilling commentary about contemporary relationships.  Plato said in ""The Republic,""  ""A society that chooses freedom over justice leads to chaos"" (paraphrase). In ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" Plato's prescient words come alive!  Each character is motivated by selfish motives in a real life game of ""Twister."" While, the movie has a ""happily ever after"" ending to it, it let's human nature off the hook for better ratings. Of course, no one wants to happily leave the movie feeling everyone lost, because they overreached their boundaries.  At the movie's end, society and the social environment hasn't changed, but we're left to feel good that the characters triumphed, because they all had an epiphany.

Once, I'd like to see a movie where the characters self-destruct due to greed and selfishness.  The ride home between couples would be contemplative.

3150813,5,B00164KYV4,"So I knew that I wanted to see this movie, but never got a chance to do so until it came out on DVD. I kind of knew what to expect, but at the same time I also didn't. After having seen it now, I'd have to say that it was a pretty good movie. I hesitate to say that it was one of the best movies I've ever seen because it didn't quite have that quality that I look for when I think of a movie as truly great. It was most definitely a lot different than some of those typical, run-of-the-mill romantic comedies. This was in my opinion one of the better if not the best romantic comedies that I've ever seen, and that's saying something. I'm not saying that I've seen every single Rom-Com out there, but I've seen my fair share of them. The movie called Definitely Maybe is pretty much the only other one that I consider to be a really good Rom-Com. Well, maybe not but it's the first one that comes to mind. I like it when a movie's plot isn't super complicated and you're trying to figure out what on earth is going on while still paying attention to the movie. This movie was very easy to follow. At first, I was going to say that one of the relationships that takes place in the movie seemed a bit much or something like that, but as I continued to write my review, I realized that it kind of drove the point home a little more by having that relationship there in the movie. Basically, if you're in the mood for an entertaining movie that is less likely to make you feel like checking your watch or a clock halfway through, then this might be a good option for you to choose.",1247875200,,1578,4.110032362459547

""He Is Just Not That Into You"" is a more realistic romantic comedy - not every character gets a happy Hollywood ending, but they all grow in the span of their relationships. The movie is a lot more hopeful than the book it was loosely adapted from.

The cast is superb, particularly Ginnifer Goodwin as a girl who just can't seem to find love, but is desperately looking for it with every guy she meets.

The opening sequence of the movie is worth the price of the film alone - it speaks to the core of what causes the misunderstandings and misgivings that girls have about relationships.",1247356800,,768,4.356643356643357

3150828,4,B00164KYV4,"Dating is, perhaps, the oldest game there is.  We all play it at some point, devoting countless hours and resources to it, only to fail a majority of the time.  We enlist the help of others--friends, books, websites, seminars, etc.--but even with such help we still end up utterly lost.  There doesn't seem to be a fixed set of rules, and when we think we've found a set, countless exceptions pop up and throw said ""rules"" out the window.  Aiding and abetting our frustrated attempts are well-meaning friends who encourage us through assurances of our likeability, our attractiveness, the other person's stupidity, etc.  So why do we continue to play this game?  We play in hopes of finding that ever-elusive thing called love.

It is into this eternal fracas that the filmmakers of He's Just Not That Into You cast their audience.  This is the story of nine intertwining lives, each person's tale adding another layer to the complexity of relationships that we all encounter day to day.  This film boasts an all-star cast and, for the most part, does not disappoint.  It is charming, funny, dramatic, shocking, and incredibly honest.  A rare find in a ""romantic comedy"" genre so often riddled with puerile vapidity.

Though a story of nine lives, the central story guiding the film is that of Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), a hopeless romantic who spends much of her time pining by a phone hoping her latest date will call.  As tends to happen in such circumstances, Gigi is patronized and coddled by her girlfriends who attempt to assuage her fears of being rejected and alone.  Then Gigi meets Alex (Justin Long), a straight-shooting bar manager who opens Gigi's eyes to the difference between what men tell her and what they really mean.  This includes the shocking reality that sometimes guys just aren't into the girls they go on dates with.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with this as everyone can't be ""the One,"" it's just a fact that needs to be accepted and dealt with.

The rest of the film deals primarily with stereotypes:  the obsessive compulsive wife, the pompous jackass who finds it hard to believe that marriage means he can only sleep with one person for the rest of his life, the sultry libertine who lures him away, the guy who ""doesn't believe in marriage,"" the woman who's been with him for nearly a decade hoping he'll change his mind, and of course those who are looking for love in all the wrong places/faces/online profiles.  But even though these characters are stereotypes, they are believable and done very well.  All of us know people exactly like the ones portrayed on screen and so we are able to connect with, and probably even empathize, with what is transpiring before our eyes.

All in all, this film is quite enjoyable and I appreciate the honest way in which relationships are portrayed by the filmmakers.  It's refreshing to see a ""chick flick"" which actually has some basis in reality and does not fit the typical ""girl meets guy, they fall in love, fight and break up, get back together, and live happily ever after"" formula that typifies the genre.  Inevitably, some will not like what they see on screen and will claim it's too harsh on certain types of people.  My only response to that would be:  the truth sometimes hurts.

Video/Audio
The Blu-ray disc is presented in full 1080p in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is excellent and really brings out the vibrant colors used throughout the film.  The audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is very crisp.  This is mostly a talking movie, so it's hard to really evaluate the sound, but I had absolutely no complaints about the quality.

Special Features
There are a number of special features included on the Blu-ray disc.  These include deleted scenes with commentary by the director, a featurette on translating the book into the film, and an interesting look into how film directors stage such seemingly extemporaneous scenes as phone calls.  The most interesting special feature for me personally are six mini-interviews with the characters of the film showing how their lives have changed since the conclusion of the film.  Very interesting way to continue the story and brings a further sense of realness to the lives of the characters.",1247097600,,4231,4.8238557558945905
3150829,4,B00164KYV4,"I was not into seeing this film, but I watched it for free. This movie was not the romantic comedy I was expecting. It was extremely blunt about the problems and expectations men and, especially, women have when it comes to dating. Blunt to the point where you cringe for the characters, but the information for these people is necessary. It is the only way they can grow and gain the ability to be in a real relationship. That being said it did have some truly funny parts that blended into the movie perfectly.

The actors were all great, none more so than Ginnifer Goodwin. She is a lovable gal, who unfortunately lives in the dark when it comes to guys. And shock of all shocks, my favorite guy in this movie is Ben Affleck. (I despise this man as an actor, so for me this is huge.)

The only problem is I feel like the movie almost excuses certain characters for unacceptable behavior. (Minor SPOILER) The cheaters seem let off the hook instead of reprimanded. I don't care what society we live in or what year it is, cheating is always wrong!

I became a semi fan of Greg Bernhardt (?) even watched his short lived talk show.  The characters in this movie was dead on.  They were interesting, and the movie was engaging not boring.  My best couples was Gigi and Alex, but also Jennifer Anniston's character and Ben Affleck.  Marriage is an important part of most women's lives.  I never could quite understand why some guys can be content of going on for years and years without commiting to marriage.  What's the difference?  I think this movie kind of answered it for me.  When being pressured and pushed, guys will run....but as soon as they are able to relax about it; and get no resistance from their partner, all of a sudden marriage isn't such a bad thing.  Loved this movie...it was lighthearted and made me smile and felt good at the end.

This movie shares some attributes with one movie I do like, ""When Harry Met Sally"", the interviews in between segments, but done slightly differently.

OK. I loved this movie.

I almost cheered when Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) and Justin Long (Alex) got together. It was sooo cute.

Scarlett Johansson, who I always thought was pretty is positively thick for this movie. Really smokin' hot. She's a great actress, too. I've always liked Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston and they didn't disappoint. I didn't care for Jennifer Connelly's character and felt like stomping on her foot by the end of the movie, but they can't all be winners, can they? I like Drew Barrymore too and her character was cute in a Drew Barrymore way, but she was swallowed up by the other sizable actors around her in her seemingly small role. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where Drew Barrymore was dwarfed before. Even in ""Donnie Darko"", her supporting role spotlighted her between the Gyllenhals. Kris Kristofferson as Jennifer Aniston's dad and Luis Guzman as a typecast Mexican worker role: two great actors which were sadly almost were non-existent in this movie...disappointing. I was just waiting to see what happened with Long and Goodwin! Really.

'He Doesn't Like You All Too Much' is the story of four or five couples/relationships that are as close to a tragic bus accident as one could get.

1.  You have your clingy, overbearing, highly annoying girl who talks a lot and can't understand why nobody wants to call her or ask her out for a second date.  It's possible that it's because she's annoying and talks an awful lot, I don't know.

2.  You have the college sweethearts who married, but don't really know why they're married...and it takes a flaky blonde (Johansson) winning a cooler that holds a sixer of Schlitz tallboys at a convenient store to make the husband realize this.  ""This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me!""  proclaims Scarlet as she holds up the camping item worth about $3.50.

3.  The couple where the guy doesn't believe in marriage, but the woman wants to.

4.  A real estate agent who is horribly miscast (women don't like guys who are 4'11"", I'm sorry).  He is trying to nail a couple of the cast members.

5.  Uh...what am I missing, here?  Oh, there's Drew Barrymore who really has no business being in this movie.  Her character is a complete afterthought and it's almost as if the production went on and then 3/4 of the way through shooting the thing the Assistant Director had to remind everyone, ""Hey, we've had Drew Barrymore over there in her trailer for the first 45 days of the shoot...do you want to use her at all? ""

It's just two hours of people whining about relationships and I suppose it's all supposed to be poignant, but it's nothing you haven't seen on 'The Young & The Restless'.

This movie is just an elongated soap opera, really.

If you want to know the secret to a great relationship, then watch my movie when it comes out.  It's called 'Don't Get Married Until You're Over 30 & Don't Get Married If You Don't Want To.'  It's going to be really good...better than this.",1246233600,3,2105,4.452879581151833

At 129 minutes, it also runs way too long given its singular focus on the romantic predicaments of the nine principals in the cast. Not too surprisingly, the whole venture feels like an extended episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B0001ENX5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;with well-known actors who appear to have divergent takes on what the movie is really about. There are four separate storylines to track, and they're all tethered to Gigi, an emotionally insecure twenty-something who takes her shallow bar conversations with men so seriously that she constantly waits for them to follow up. She had high hopes for Conor, a real estate agent who never calls her back, but she then finds an unexpected dating coach in his best friend Alex, a promiscuous bar owner who cynically teaches her how to read the signs of non-interest.

Meanwhile, Janine, one of Gigi's co-workers, feels something is going awry in her marriage to Ben as she busies herself renovating their home. He accidentally meets comely yoga instructor and aspiring singer Anna at the local supermarket, and they embark on a clandestine affair against their better judgment. Gigi's other co-worker Beth has been living monogamously with Neil, a photographer, for seven years, and marriage doesn't appear in the cards. They break up due to his lack of desire to get married, but a near-tragedy at Beth's younger sister's wedding makes them reconsider their relationship. Providing a full circle to the film's structure, the fourth plot has Anna rebuffing the serious overtures of an enamored Conor as she considers her situation with Ben, while her friend Mary, a newspaper editor who faces a similar predicament as Gigi, finds a connection with Conor when he starts advertising his business in her paper.

It's really the pat treatment of the intertwining characters that trivializes the movie into something just a little deeper than a TV commercial. Had there been more focus on one of the stories, say Gigi and Alex's, with the rest relegated to minor subplots, then the movie could have possibly resonated more. The cast is certainly attractive enough, but I wouldn't say they are ideally compatible as an ensemble. Ginnifer Goodwin (the youngest wife on HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Love/dp/B0011UMC72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Love</a>) has to play up Gigi's eager nervousness at such an excitable level that her neediness starts to feel too one-note. As lothario-in-love Alex, Justin Long (yes, the Apple guy) seems miscast in a swinger role that would have been a better fit for Bradley Cooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>), who plays Ben. Even more, the friends-to-lovers relationship between him and Goodwin never feels quite authentic enough to sustain the story arc it needs to support. Initially, it was nice to see Jennifer Connelly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind/dp/B000FVQLQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind</a>) in a lighter role than her usual sturm und drang, but as Janine recognizes her husband's adultery, she bears the burden of the film's most dramatic episode.

As Ben, Cooper is merely called upon to look guilty for most of his screen time, that is, when he is not being seduced by the sultry charms of Scarlett Johansson as Anna. After her work for Woody Allen, she seems particularly on automatic pilot here and not very challenged by the role. Kevin Connolly (HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Entourage/dp/B001AQO3V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Entourage</a>) plays Conor in a way that forces him to waver between boyish and selfish. Perhaps due to their tabloid overexposure, Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck at first don't seem to mesh well with the others, but as the story progresses, both turn in surprisingly sympathetic work as Beth and Neil. Rounding out the cast is executive producer Drew Barrymore, who plays Mary as a comic wallflower confused by the complicated impact of communications technology on dating. The 2009 DVD is fairly bare-bones containing both the widescreen and full-screen versions of the film. There is a handful of deleted scenes with optional commentary from Kwapis, although it seems like a surprising omission not to have his insights included on an optional commentary track for the film itself.",1245628800,2,5083,6.047156726768377
3150852,4,B00164KYV4,"First I heard that so many great actors and actresses in this movie, I felt like whaoow.. it must have been a great script that all of them join the team to make this movie. But sometimes they're kinda tricky, many great actor and a good director but suddenly it's way overrated (which I don't understand how come they waste all that talents) but not in this one. People kinda harsh to this movie, I guess that they expect a simple feel good chick flick, or romantic comedy, as usual. This one is more of a serious romantic drama with a little bit humor like in real life, so I found it amazing. Real life opinion (not the ones they put on purpose between each written explanation, ex : ""if he never calls you"" then some guy or girl talks.. no .. not that one), the story itself is telling us about relationship, how to find and maintain one, in a great storytelling style, it's kinda slow at the beginning but it's all worthied to be watched and learned from. Some little real life comedy here and there, but overall it's a great drama about realtionships. All the actors, actresses and the director are doing a great job.

If you are trying to find or in a relationship, this movie is totally worthwatching. Trust me. If you are a chick flick regular, probably you won;t find this one as fun as other chick flick or romantic comedy (because  this is more of a drama). I like it a lot.

3150853,1,B00164KYV4,"I am going to do my best to write a proper review for this flick BECAUSE I HATE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. And I want to share that hate with you.

We open with giant bubble of perkiness Gennifer Goodwin as Gigi as a child, with her older self giving a voice-over. She is a young girl on a playground, and a boy comes over to her and shoves her to the ground. She runs crying to her mother, and her mother says the boy did it because he likes her. Gigi then speculates that this is what screws with so many women's heads and messes with them later in life, because they come to associate bad behavior by men with affection. We then join Gigi as an adult at the end of a date with Conor, this totally bland yuppie. He says he'll give her a call and she gets excited when she sees him taking his cell phone out, but he calls Scarlett Johansson as Anna. She tells him she doesn't want to get together just then, and gets ridiculously excited over this cooler she won [it's depressing to see Scarlett Johansson have to act so stupid], and flirts with the guy behind her in line, Ben. He's a music producer and she's an aspiring singer, but he tells her he can't hear from her, because he's married... to Jennifer Connelly as Janine, who works in the same office as Gigi and Jennifer Aniston as Betsy, at some magazine [this is the Cosmopolitan magazine version of life, in which everyone works at a magazine or is a yoga instructor or a music producer]. Betsy has been living with Ben Affleck as Neil for seven years, but he doesn't want to get married because he doesn't believe in marriage. Which, in this movie, is less preferable to being a Satanist, say, or a leper. Oh, and by the way, all of this is supposedly happening in Baltimore. Have you ever BEEN to Baltimore?

So Gigi starts obsessing over Conor calling, although we have no evidence that they had any particular chemistry or connection. She waits for him to call, staring at her phone at work! In the shower! At her yoga class! Janine advises her on when to call and for how long. Soon she's planning on just ""stopping by"" a place he said he sometimes frequents in order to engineer a run-in with him. The majority of the first half-hour here is made up of Gigi growing more obsessive about whether Conor, who you will recall she met once, will call, with her entire sense of self-worth apparently hanging in the balance. It gets to the point where she really does seem to be the badly-damaged shell of what once was a human being. She does go to the restaurant he said he frequents, where she ends up meeting his friend, Alex, played by Justin Long, who apparently runs the place. He came out to help at the bar, as they were super busy, but apparently has time to just sit around and talk to Gigi all night. He tells her flat-out that Conor will never call, because--can you guess?--He's Just Not That Into Her. Alex will be the one to deliver the major bullet points of the self-help book this is adapted from for the remainder of the movie. He also tells her that too many women hear what amounts to urban legends about women who didn't give up on a guy, and finally he relented and they got married. He says too many women think that they'll be ""the exception"" when in fact they are ""the rule."" Gigi seems over Conor the next day at work--where apparently their jobs consist of sitting around and obsessing over relationships.

SPOILERS > > > Meanwhile, Ben has decided that there's no harm in flirting with Anna, and calls her. This involves him smoking cigarettes on the sly, which he tries, through several scenes and numerous lies, to keep from his wife, Janine. The issue slowly starts to gnaw at her sanity, as she knows something is wrong, but Ben won't admit it. There is a bizarre scene in which she accuses Luis Guzman's contractors of smoking while they work on renovating their house. Once it's revealed that Ben actually is smoking, she says ""What part of `my father died of lung cancer' is so hard for you to understand?"" as though her personal trauma gives her license to completely control his life. Eventually he comes clean that he had an affair, expecting her to simply dump him, then surprised that she wants to talk about it and work it out. Janine blames herself. It must be said that this is the only thread of the movie that feel in any way genuine, as Jennifer Connelly is able to bring some real, grounded emotion to it.

Meanwhile Betsy grows more and more upset that Neil won't marry her, despite his repeated assurances that he loves her, and doesn't believe in marriage on ideological grounds. Idi-a-whatdicalogical grounds? Janine says. When Alex gives Gigi the advice that if a guy hasn't married you after two years, he isn't going to marry you, Betsy goes home and tells Neil that ""she needs him to not be nice to her if he isn't going to marry her."" This is the sort of ""kooky"" statement that some women apparently think is adorable [this movie made me really glad not to be straight]. Anyway, despite the fact that their relationship is going swimmingly, Betsy ""Can't do this"" and breaks up with Neil for not marrying her. In here we briefly see Drew Barrymore in a tiny part that has no relation to anything. Nevertheless, Drew produced the film, so special scorn must be heaped on her.

So some of the corollary advice to ""if a man hasn't married you... he's not going to marry you"" that Alex gives Gigi is that ""If a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."" This casts the whole situation as that all women are desperate for men to call, and are delighted to hear from and date any man, while men are completely in control of the situation, and can choose to call the woman back or not, as they like. If they want to see a woman, the woman WILL see them. I'm sure several men out there would be quite surprised to find out that this is the case. Anyway, Gigi shows that she has actually not grown beyond her desperate yearning for a boyfriend above all else, only altered the context of her delusions, as she starts to believe that Alex is secretly in love with her, and has been telling her this in code all along. She accepts his invitation to a party as the fruition of their secret passion, and finally makes an ill-advised move on him.

He tells her that no, he is actually not secretly in love with her, causing her to deliver a withering character assessment about how he just uses people and never really connects to anyone, concluding ""You have not won. You're alone, Alex."" We'll leave until later discussion of WHAT Gigi could possibly mean by classifying the entire issue into ""winning"" and ""losing,"" with finding companionship [regardless of with who?] definitively posed as ""winning.""

Okay, time to arbitrarily stop the movie and wrap everything up! Time's up, folks! Betsy and Neil get back together! And guess what? He proposes in a cute, TV-movie way, and they get married! Mary [that's Drew] and Conor get together! Anna has a singing gig [i.e. she hasn't found a relationship, but she's on her way to pursuing her dream]! Janine and Ben, surprise, break up, and she moves out! And Gigi's harsh character assessment was exactly what Alex needed to realize that goll-darn it, she's right! And in fact, she is the very woman he must spend the rest of his life with! They've WON. < < < SPOILERS END

The primary emotion this movie evokes is sadness for people who view relationships this way, and the people who will watch this movie and feel that they must adopt to these standards in order to find a relationship, and hence to ""win."" Gigi is a character clearly in need of several years of reparative therapy for her wildly distorted view of her own value and human relationships, yet the movie tries to coast on a ""We're all like this, deep inside!"" vibe. The pathetic obsession she develops over whether Conor will call her is embarrassing and sad, not adorable. Her lack of insight developed through the film--she simply switches fantasy-based obsession with Conor for fantasy-based obsession with Alex--is also disheartening. Yet the film has no criticism of her, it holds her up as a model for the winning strategy of being sincere and open to people, which apparently trumps all other characteristics--like, say, wisdom or intelligence. By the time she indicates that for her, being partnered is ""winning"" and being alone ""losing,"" one pities her distorted view of relationships, but the point of the view of the movie is that this is pretty much the way things are.

Betsy is blind to the attributes of her relationship, and only the public validation of a wedding can make it real to her. At which point she can begin looking forward to the next milestone, having a baby [as Janine wishes to do], with an option to also achieve wonderful completions of self such as renovating one's fabulous loft! Really, you should receive two free issues of Cosmopolitan with your ticket purchase, which will convert to a full subscription unless you cancel.

The movie really is disconcerting and uncomfortable in the way that it suggests that all women are wholly mentally preoccupied with guys, whether a guy will call, whether they'll have a relationship [they'll WIN!], and then get married, then renovate the loft, then have a baby! After that, I suppose life ends? Or I think perhaps you flip into being the bitter wife whose husband likes younger women but its okay because you have the credit card to acquire shoes and redo the house again? While watching the movie I kept wondering at the mindset--and set-up for disappointment--that people who share this film's worldview must have. I mean, WHAT is going to happen after you've finally scored that relationship? After you've ""won?"" And most of all, after one has married, that ultimate milestone and validation of all that is you! Most films end with marriage and don't bother to show what comes after, but this one really egregiously sets that up as the ultimate prize, to the point where one begins to worry about the people that might be taken in by this viewpoint. We all know that one person who just keeps talking about having a relationship, and their new strategy for getting a relationship, and how their main focus is on finding a relationship, and after a while you want to say ""Um, what do you think is going to HAPPEN when you find this mythical relationship? You're going to be delivered into some blissful state of endless nirvana and never have any other concerns or problems again?"" Because like those people, this movie just kind of makes you WORRY for those people that have this distorted viewpoint, and wish that somehow they could just undergo a complete, ground-up change of mind.

Let's again underscore this film's view of women as vacuous bundles of emotional need who seem unable or unwilling to process anything that doesn't have to do with DATING! And superficial symbols of personal validation such as someone thinking one is cute or calling one back. The irony is that this is positioning itself so heavily as a ""chick flick,"" and to be supportive of women, when in fact it is painting them as neurotic and shallow strivers with significantly warped self-images, lacking any secure sense of self [except that which they think they should SEEM to have in order to be more DATABLE!] and desperate for the validation of any fleeting attention from even the most unsuitable of men. It's just sad, more than anything! Talk about the five-hankie weeper of the year. OH, and by the way, this is apparently supposed to be a ""comedy.""

Really, I don't understand why feminists weren't burning theaters down when this was out.

The ultimate betrayal this movie is guilty of is devoting two hours to trying to strip women of their delusions about romance and get them to accept that the ""fairy tale"" ending they yearn for is not a reality--then end is such a way that nearly all the characters achieve that magical, surprise fairy tale ending! And like in the fairy tale, it leaves the women in the audience, the ones in supposedly supports, with the old ""they lived happily ever after"" and doesn't bother to include what might happen as these people continue to live their lives. But whatever, they've ""WON!""

This is one of those things where one feels that the director, Ken Kwapis, and the screenwriters, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, really need to be exiled to a desert island, where they can inflict no more damage on society. You will need chemical decontamination after this film and women, please do not let your daughters watch this damaging film.

I would like to say first of all that I am not a prude...however, I was appalled that this movie was rated PG-13 as I would have died a slow death had I watched it with her when she was 5 years younger.  The language (the F word is used more than once along with other ""colorful metaphors""), the fairly graphic office sex scene with two of the characters, the one character saying how she'd like to ""dry hump"" one of the male characters, partial nudity, etc., make this movie totally inappropriate for anyone under 17 and should have been rated R.  In addition, it's boring and I had to fight to stay awake.",1245283200,2,726,4.2846715328467155

You will probably have to decide that for yourself, but I found it watchable--I must have, because I saw it twice at the theatre, and I bought the DVD!--but then, that's me.  If I don't expect too much from a film, and if there is a cast of exceptional actors, then I will probably really enjoy it.

Some of the reviews of this movie complained about the huge cast, but to me, it was kind of like a slice of real life--albeit singles life in the New Millennium--with a group of interconnected characters.  It was more than a series of vignettes, like you might have found in the old Robert Altman films, since the characters were all connected in some way (via a kind of six-degrees-of-separation fashion); furthermore, the same characters kept popping up often enough that you could actually follow their adventures, as they attempt to figure out the ""rules"" for singles life.

Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Ben Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore are some of the major stars you'll find here.  They are fun to watch and bring out some interesting points about how men and women view relationships in very different ways.  Nothing new there!

For these reasons, I decided to grant five stars to this flick.

Laurel-Rain Snow",1245283200,3,1558,5.485355648535565
3150867,5,B00164KYV4,"I love this film.  I saw it first as a rental and immediately purchased it.  I have viewed it an additional 3 times since.  Peope try to label this film but that is something you can't do.  It is a film that while following the lives of many people educates the viewer on why guys do what they do when dating.  Many say this is definitely not a date movie.  I totally disagree.  Unless you have tried some of the antics in the film on the date you are with you will share many laughs at what people go through when dating.

The first thing I did find I had to adjust to was not only all the characters lives intersecting in some way but also the fact that every character was a big name star.  After getting over that and then seeing the characters for who they were it was smooth sailing.  I thought the film did an amazing job of making six separate storylines intertwine and be believable, not forced or over the top.  The main story that all flows from is the storyline between Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long.  They both shine and keep the film anchored.  I also found the storyline between Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck very touching.  It was a very real situation that many couples face.  Jennifer Aniston brought an amazing depth to her role and made me scream for her to finally get the ideal role that would show all her potential.

Viewers will have their favorite storylines and favorite characters based on which stars they like and also which situations they may have faced in their own lives.  I thought each actor was given great moments to shine both dramatically and comicly.  Jennifer Connelly is a hoot with her obsession over cigarettes and Drew Barrymore is charming.  Bottom line for me, this film is a very witty intelligent story that educates on dating in the current age.  The writing and direction is superb and provides the actors firm ground to soar.  This movie made me laugh.  This movie made me tear up as well and I am a 46 year old guy.  Could this be a date movie?  You bet.

And the blu ray version is a feast for the eyes.  The 1080p high def picture is so crystal clear and vibrant.  Colors are crisp and flesh tones perfection.  There is no grain and the picture is just as detailed in the day and night scenes.  As for the audio, this is a dialogue driven film and the audio presentation works perfectly.

This movie is a treat.  It is so nice to see an intelligent comedy for a change and you will love seeing your favorite stars have a ball with the script.  You will also discover some new favorite stars.  For me I had no idea who Bradley Cooper was.  I was thinking this guy was great with nice comedic timing and then he is suddenly out there with THE HANGOVER and becoming a true star.  He does great work here too.

I highly recommend this film.  If you are a player then you engage in these realistic antics and the film will bug you.  But for everyone else it is a feel good film that will touch your heart.",1245283200,2,2962,4.318181818181818
3150868,4,B00164KYV4,"Yes, Hollywood can still make successful character driven films with smart dialog. No Animation, no special effects, no explosions, just a good story told well.

""He's Just Not That Into You"", written by Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein based on the book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo hit theatres on February 6th, 2009, and was the surprise of the Post Oscars/Pre-Summer Junk Dump Season.  Since you may have missed it as few venture out into that barren cinematic wasteland that is February, now is the time to catch this fun flick as New Line Home Video sends it to the shelves on Tuesday June 2nd, 2009.

This one hundred and twenty-nine minute romp includes a talented ensemble cast including: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Scarlett, Johansson, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Justin Long.  Though slightly skewed too far to one side, ""He's Just Not That Into You"", takes an in depth look into relationships and respective success and failure.  We want different things, with different people, and no one knows what the other is thinking.  Should relationships be this hard?  Should watching others struggle through them be this enjoyable?  It is simply because, though we may not relate to all these people, we do relate to the situations.  That is a reflection of good writing, and one might have to go back as far as ""The Big Chill"" to find people we enjoy this much who are talking about things we care about.

From a young woman out to find love being mentored by the all knowing bar manager, to the puppy dog clinging to the hottie who really wants the married guy who thinks he may have made a mistake, to the guy who just doesn't want to get married to the woman he loves, to the women in relationships they just can't figure out due to a myriad of reasons including the growing relationship reliance on technology, this film has it all.  Someone should write a book.  Oh, wait, they did.  Inspired by an episode and based on a book written by two writers of ""Sex in the City"", this film reaches levels of enjoyment that Carrie and her clan only wish they could bring to the big screen.

Yes, not all the performances are on the same level.  Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly give performances that are limited in dimension through most of the film, and the transition made by Justin long as he goes from the cool dating mentor, to frantic heart sick puppy may be beyond his young capabilities, but the majority of the cast give fine performances in what are all essentially supporting roles.  In most cases we end up wanting more of the people we saw the least of, and less of those we saw the majority of.

Though there is little offered as Special features in this new release; the additional scenes are surprisingly enlightening and entertaining.  In most cases we can usually see why scenes are indeed left out of a film, and with ""He's Just Not That Into You"" boasting a running time of over two hours, an argument can certainly be made for the cuts made, but the insights on parental influence found in these scenes were entertaining and well acted. Adding commentary by Director Ken Kwapis, who did a fine job of utilizing his stacked cast within a well paced tale, makes sitting through the extra scenes again well worth the investment.

Recommendation: This is a great film to watch with friends and a surprisingly pleasant addition to any collection. The story and the dialog are the stars here, and well worth your time.",1245283200,,3493,4.69672131147541
3150869,2,B00164KYV4,"I wondered how movie makers would turn a relationship guide into a successful hit movie...and I never found out...because this movie was lacking.  I'm just not that into it.  A couple of years ago, I bought Greg Behrendt's book (""He's Just Not That into You"") and absolutely LOVED it!  It offered good advice and was funny as well.

Unfortunately, none of that transferred to the big screen. Everybody got the story line; so, it became boring watching so many of the same examples of women simply not understanding when a man is just not that into them.  When a person doesn't (1) call, (2) return calls, (3) act interested, 4) make time to see you, etc., it's because he/she is not interested.  Period.

After a while, the movie seemed to drag on endlessly.  So, as much as I loved the book, I did not enjoy the movie enough to buy the DVD.  I may watch it when it comes on cable...unless I have laundry to do.  LOL!",1245196800,2,917,4.437125748502994

I could not believe how virtually all the women were portrayed as gullible, stupid, pathetically yearning for a guy, and, in Jennifer Connelly's case, irritatingly whiny and nagging.

3150875,4,B00164KYV4,"Several reviewers have identified this film as being for the dating and coupling scene of youth.  I disagree.  We have many older folks out in the dating arena, these days, going through some of the same angst of the younger generations.  Will they call?  Do they care?  Are they married and hiding it?  And, for many older women who have become accomplished, they have to wonder; are they after me, or my hard-earned, success.  So searching for Mr. Right, over the course of our lifespans, doesn't change that much; in fact, it can get more complicated. So, in essence, this movie can provide some thoughts to ponder across the age spectrum. A very good thing, since even seniors, can turn into gushy teens, again, when shot by Cupid's arrow.

(SPOILER) Some felt that the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jeniffer Aniston's characters was a tad unbelievable; that they would live together for 7 years without marriage and that ultimately Ben's character would cave. I disagree, again; their relationship rang the truest. They had a very loving, faithful relationship, that had endured time.  When Aniston's character removed the obstacle of marriage, Ben's character no longer felt he was being forced into conformity.  It was then HIS decision; one conceived in freedom-of-choice. This was textbook Psych 101, 'you can take the horse to water, but can't make him drink,' until he darn well pleases.

The idea of 'marriage' was the area I found unsettling, because how many of us ladies were the one to drop the, less than subliminal, idea of 'marriage' first?  If so, it makes you wonder if your partner really wanted the same thing, or if they just 'settled.'  This was very well, and sadly, depicted in the Connelly relationship.  And, for many who did push the commitment proposal, first, I suspect it will have them staring into their partner's eyeballs with some jaded contempt, wondering why they didn't have the storybook proposal, while strongly empathizing with Connelly.

The cast was stellar, with a few reservations. Drew Barrymore's character was irresistibly charming, as always. Johannsen's husband-stealing seduction was very well played out, and, is guaranteed to make you bring out the cat-claws.  You've seen the type too many times before, but then, she wasn't the problem, just a symptom of a much deeper one, which is generally the case.  The character I found most annoying was J. Goodwin. Yeah, she was cute, but too ditsy and trying too darn hard to connect with Mr. Right. Her behaviors were the most immature of the bunch, but we've all known friends like her; ones that we are always telling 'you can't find anyone if you're trying too hard---it will happen when you least expect it.' This philosophy even rang true for her.

I thought this film could have been better developed, and the messages deepened. It had a 'flaky' factor I did not embrace.  I'd rate it a B+ accomplishment. However, I will still recommend it to all my friends that remain on the prowl; even for those that believe they've found their soul-mate, because it reminds us that things aren't always as they appear; that denial can exist in what is believed to be the perfect union, leading to lost years and promises---and life is too darn short.

Have a girl's night, watch it, and cherry-pick the scenes of wisdom, and/or the behaviors that apply to you.  I can almost guarantee that you'll find some.",1244332800,24,3409,4.8939130434782605

The movie goes back and forth between a bunch of different couples and single people and their problems and mishaps but it seems more like a horrible documentary to me. Througout each ""stage"" you have words that pop up on the screen and then you have random people talk about their real relationship like a documentary. The movie was NOT funny at all and it was really really boring. It switched between people way too quickly and it was just a bunch of people throwing themselves at each other. You had a crazy woman that threw herself at every guy she seen, you had the husband that was cheating on his wife with another woman that was in her own relationship, you had the woman who broke up with her boyfriend because he wouldn't marry her after 7 years, etc. I wanted to turn it off within the first 30 mins BUT I sat it through and I really wish I wouldn't of.

This movie does show what people go through in relationships but who wants to watch a ""documentary"" on every one else's relationship? If you have been in a relationship or you are in one now you have already ""seen"" this movie so to speak.

3150900,2,B00164KYV4,"This is the part (once I really get into the meat of the review) where the desperate to wed or clingy, why isn't he calling me types are going to string me up by my over 30 and beat the bs statistic married shoestrings. First of all the actors/actresses they picked for this movie were fantastic, and the title literally explains a perfectly logical point that He (or even she) Is Not That Into You. When I caught it on Sex & he City, it was genius. Of course! It makes sense....we all have had people in our lives that we liked, but didn't have that kind of chemistry with. They usually fell into friend zone. I think society puts too much emphasis that people of the opposite sex can not be friends and can only date. What's wrong with just hanging out and getting to know someone? Given my experience, I think we should be friends first and foremost. At least than either something blossoms from it or doesn't, but can if it's going to happen without the ridiculous presser people put on themselves to be with someone (anyone). And this movie certainly sells the same heaping spoonful that everyone has to have someone, even if they settle. I'll give a brief bio of the characters as part of my review as the movie itself is hard to describe otherwise.

Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) who we know from Big Love, is a delightful person you just want to layer in bubble wrap in hopes to keep her hopeless puppy heart from being broken. She clings to the phone in dire almost painful neediness, and eventually grows frustrated with the language and games people play.

Scarlett Johansson....oh the lovely married to Ryan Reynolds in real life Scarlett...her character Anna is one we all want to hate. I myself wanted to run into this character in real life and slap her in her pretty face, tether her to my rear bumper by her lengthy blond locks, and drag her a few miles across uneven terrain. Without ruining it for you, in case you are going to watch this regardless of the reviews, I'll just say this....she's a beautiful manipulative, pouty siren who, in her own twisted logic way, is looking for love in all the completely wrong places.

Drew Barrymore plays a wonderful little part; always quirky and with a little comic relief. But you only get bits and pieces of her. Eventually, in a round about way, she gets what she's looking for and we're happy for her.

Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck play a couple that have been together for years (over 5), living together in a great apartment, building a life until one day Beth (Anniston) has gotten it in her head that they need to be married. I'll tell you right now the long, pointless dance they play out was utterly predicable. I annoyed my girl friend sitting next to me (as I wasn't going to drag my fianc at the time to this piece of chickflick), bursting out with each accurate prediction. Tiring drama.

Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper play another couple whom have been married for a little while, having undertaken the arduous ordeal of renovating an old house. I won't even begin to elucidate the complicated, disturbed, deep-rooted psychological/other issues between this couple other than go Janine! (Jennifer Connelly) towards the end of the movie.

Overall the movie should be seen more as a dark comedy or drama rather than a romantic one. My friend and I left (she's married and I engaged at the time and both having dated in the past obviously) with this horribly somber feeling that we were unable to express in words until days later. I was depressed and pitying, upset, and felt the characters in general were sad and utterly, self destructively unhappy. I get it's just a movie, based off a tag line, based off a book, etc...however the movie didn't do the point justice. More like promoted that if you are desperate enough, clingy enough, or demanding enough, you'll get what you want or get something you thought you wanted and realized you settled or pushed for something unnaturally against instinct from your partner. I was disappointed with the plot and certain aspects of pointless drama.",1243555200,5,4073,4.657858136300417

The 129 minutes does seem long, but the variety of color tests and hidef clarity showcasing this awesome cast makes for a watchable Blu. The colors, depth and scenery variety make for an adequate representation, including the sailing, the dark indoors, room decors, and Scarlett. The sound is uneventful but you do have the choice between TrueHD or normal 5.1. And if even just to hear Kristofferson's voice say anything in TrueHD, albeit only two scenes.

* A ""newspaper"" format of the six couples/storylines that when selected, allows you to delve deeper into the characters' lives. Actually, brief excerpts can be seen during the credit sequence. Each one totals three minutes and admittedly, it peaked every single customer's interest when they saw it, because it seems real. Several people thought they were watching Hollywood couples being interviewed about their relationships. Bradley Cooper's ""interview"" gathered the biggest crowd, but irritated most of the guys watching.

* If one ever has interest into how much a phone conversation scene in a movie can be micromanaged, look no further. This four minute feature has the director dissect in detail how they made one of the phone call scenes have relevance that even the trained eye might miss. If anything, several people now wanted to watch the film again to see what the heck he was talking about.

* The inspiration and history of the film are covered in an eleven minute documentary, catered to the die hard fans.

* The deleted scenes total 13:45 and would have been much better left in - especially since we had already endured two+ hours of this. The commentary gives no credibility as to why Scarlet's actual singing was removed from the film. Coupled with Teresa Russel's entire role being cut, it just showcased the weakness in the writing people complain about in this film.

Big fans of the film will want this as a purchase, but since 90% of my Blu customers are guys, I foresee this as mostly a rental.",1243468800,18,2347,4.823383084577115

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Two characters are desperately looking for love in the right places, but with the wrong guys.
2. One character is in love with another character, who's just not that into him.
3. One is married, but infatuated with another, who's also infatuated with him.
4. Two are living together, but only one of them wants to get married.
5. One has no intention of falling in love.

Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long, Jennifer Connelly, Ginnifer Goodwin, Kevin Connolly, and Bradley Cooper make up the star power for this romantic dramedy about relationships and falling in love.

All the main characters are also linked to other main characters through friendship or work, making for interesting mixing and matching, until the dust settles and the hearts fall where they may.

Several scenes and situations drag on too long, and the movie could have used a bit of editing for length, but overall not bad for a chick flick.

My bet is that guys will just not be that into this.

3150905,4,B00164KYV4,"I really wanted to see this movie. I did briefly peruse the book, though I personally never needed someone to slap me and say ""He's just not that into you!"". The pessimist in me always assumed the worst anyway. But none the less, the book was definitely funny.  I had seen the preview for this and like a lot of people in it. I was not disappointed! It seems people either liked or hated this movie, I fall into the like category. It kept my attention from beginning to end, which is very hard to do, I inevitably will be reaching for my computer to browse around online 8 times out of 10.

Some people find too many characters confusing, but these ones all were very distinct and no one over shadowed the other. Some of the relationships are fun and flirty, others seem destined to end. People have compared it to 'love,actually', though I personally didn't see any similarities besides the multiple 'relationships'. 'He's just not that into you' centered more around late 20's and 30's age people, I think 'love, actually' spanned a larger age range and not only were dating and married, but deaths, divorce and families. No one in this flick had families with their partner yet.

I think it's definitely worth checking it out, especially if you've dated and gotten mixed signals. You'll find lots of ""oh god, that's just like me!"" moments, both embarrassing and just plain true to life. Gigi, the narrator, is constantly reading too much into the actions of her dates and always convinced, sure maybe they like her but they're just getting side tracked from calling her. This story line alone was very cute and funny, on the other end of the spectrum there's a married couple having issues as well as a couple who has been together for 7 years and the girl is wondering ""why won't he marry me??""

Great, fun movies to check out with the girls. If you're not a perfect in every way couple, some of this might be uncomfortable to watch together.",1240531200,4,1946,4.583333333333333
3384166,4,B00164KYV4,"Hey, you...stop sitting by the phone waiting for him to call...get up and go watch this movie!

I have to admit, I'm not much of a rom-com watcher. Unlike others of its ilk, though, this flick wisely admits that relationships aren't all rainbows and butterflies, but that they are complicated, confusing, messes that aren't necessarily all sorted out by the time the credits roll.

The premise is simple enough - the film claims:

""If a guy says he'll call and doesn't, he's not in the hospital with a broken number-dialing finger; he's just not that into you"".

After a mediocre first date with pre-recession real estate agent Conor (Kevin Connolly), the film's main protagonist Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), over zealous for date success and naively optimistic as ever, is certain that she has found Mr. Right. But when he doesn't call, her friends (Jennifer Aniston as Beth and Jennifer Connelly as Janine) comfort her with assurances of his interest and case studies of how they knew someone who knew someone in the exact situation - and it worked out for them, of course!

Not that Beth or Janine are living it up in the mansion of romantic bliss, mind you. Aniston's character has been living with Neil (Ben Affleck) for seven years, and for five of the seven, she's been dying to know why he won't pop the question. Wholly against the institution of marriage, though, Neil says that he's totally committed to her and he doesn't need a piece of paper to prove...yadda, yadda, yadda.

Connelly's character Janine on the other hand is married. Happily? Not so much. Ben's (Bradley Cooper) baby blues are soon tempted toward blonder waters when he meets Anna (Scarlet Johansson) at a convenience store one fine evening; how convenient. Too bad he's married, he reasons.

Drew Barrymore easily plays Mary, Anna's friend. Her role is pretty forgettable; but then she did spend most of her time producing the movie.

Justin Long plays Alex, the woman conquering bar owner who decides to school Gigi in the thinking of men, no feelings spared.

For the most part the story lines are tied together in believable ways and it's interesting to watch just how they're all connected - kind of like 6 degrees of separation.

A tough pill to swallow:

Perhaps too realistic at times, ""He's Just"" exposes the well-intentioned way we women attempt to comfort our spurned friends - not with assurances that despite her many attractive qualities, the guy just isn't interested for one reason or another. Instead, we assure our friends that there is no way he could be uninterested.
Really ladies, if you suspect that your friend is dating a guy who can't see her true worth, before you swell her head with an idealized, irresistible image of herself, please take her to see this movie, and let her do some soul searching. The film will do all the talking for you without patronization.

Be warned:

It's hardly a date movie (unless you want to end the date by breaking up when the scales have dropped from your eyes and you realize that you're more ""into"" the relationship than your significant other).

Best performances from: Jennifer Connelly as Janine who is more obsessed with the idea that her husband is smoking behind her back than that he is having an affair. Ginnifer Goodwin too has earned her keep. Her embarrassing attempts at securing ""the one"" are so realistic you will likely find yourself reddening at the all too familiar lengths to which she goes.

Best line from the movie: Listen out for the line the guy uses who ends up with Gigi (won't say who ;-)), it could be the ""You complete me"" of the 21st century!

Disclaimer:
This film may cause some discomfort. Side effects are generally mild and may include feelings of embarrassment over previous postdate obsession/stalking.

3384167,2,B00164KYV4,"I was not terribly in to HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU (HJNTIY).  As a sum total, it was a moderately enjoyable movie, yet oddly I found it to be poorly cast/acted, and full of clichs.

HJNTIY follows various relationships among people who all either know each other, or are separated by only a degree or two at most.  We see people falling IN love, people falling OUT of love.  Some couples do both.  Some characters seem to do neither.  And naturally, most things wrap up in a satisfactory manner at the end.  It's told in loosely interwoven scenes.  The easiest comparison I can come up with is to say it's like a NYC version of LOVE, ACTUALLY.  Although I enjoyed LOVE, ACTUALLY a whole lot more...mostly because many of the performers gave energetic, committed performances, including the drop-dead funny Bill Nighy, the droll Hugh Grant and the exceedingly witty and down-to-earth Emma Thompson.

If I had to pick a ""star"" of HJNTIY, it would probably be Ginnifer Goodwin (who is fabulous on TV's BIG LOVE).  She gets the most screen time.  Her character is a young woman whose very eagerness to land a man causes her to drive them away.  She is also utterly unable to decipher the signals men are sending her, and is really the character for whom the title is meant.  She forges a friendship with bar owner Justin Long, who guides her through the ""code"" of understanding text messages, voice mail,  pick-up lines and brush-off lines.  Goodwin throws all her energy into the part, and the result is an annoying character...it's easy to see why men run from her.  Yet I had to give her credit for her efforts.  At least she was trying.

On the other end of the scale was poor Jennifer Connelly.  It's now been a scarily long time since she's had a good part or really turned in a memorable performance.  I had high hopes a couple of years ago for her appearance in LITTLE CHILDREN, and though she acquitted herself okay, the nature of her role didn't help her and then Kate Winslet just flat-out out-performed her.  She is not a natural for comedy, and she mostly looked worn out and disinterested.  Justin Long was right there as well...he looked 10 years older than the last time I saw him...frankly, he looked a little unhealthy, and he certainly appeared to be uninterested in building a relatable character.

In between we had Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck as a couple that's been together happily for years, but Affleck just won't pull the trigger on the marriage thing.  Gee, a man who's ""against"" marriage??!?!  I've NEVER seen that in a movie before.  All their scenes were charming, because these two actors are endlessly affable...but there was no real sizzle.

Scarlett Johannssen reaffirmed her limited range. Obviously she's a stunning young lady, but with each passing role, she becomes more and more affectless and listless.  She's frequently paired with Bradley Cooper, who I am HUGELY tired of seeing in any way, shape or form.  I just don't get the appeal...he seems utterly incapable of being likeable.  He convincingly plays a cad in this film, but really never makes us sympathize with him.

Also, the film underutilizes Drew Barrymore...but I suspect that her character, had she been given more screentime, would have been unlikeable too...a rare feat for the always breezy and fun Barrymore.

Again, the awkward tapestry all these characters wove was mildly entertaining throughout, and when we left the theatre, I was pleased enough to chalk it up as a ""win.""  But with merely 5 minutes reflection, I realized that there was very little work in the movie that was worthwhile, and I believe that HJNTIY will soon fade from memory.

The film MIGHT be a good ""date night"" rental...but why not watch WHEN HARRY MET SALLY again?  Or heck, even LOVE, ACTUALLY!",1235520000,5,3785,4.76036866359447
3384168,5,B00164KYV4,"I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan. I also love Jennifer Connelly and who doesnt love cute as a button Drew Barrymore? Here we find these lovely ladies all in different stages of love. Drew Barrymore works at a magazine with a bunch of homosexual guys who try to give her advice because she cant seem to get it right. Scarlett Johannson has a guy in love with her, but she has no interest as she likes a married man more. Jennifer Connolly seems satisfied in her married life until she finds it all to be a sham. Jennifer Aniston finds that she isn't really satisfied just living with a man for seven years and not being married. Then we have Gigi, she is the one actively looking for a man but being extremely clingy in the process. She finally gets some hints from Justin Long that she isn't what men are looking for, and she needs to change her plan of attack drastically.

Its a great movie. Its a coming of age romantic comedy set to the digital age that reminds us that love can be found when we least expect it. We do not have to change for a man. We also don't have to wait around for his call. Women can pick up the phone the same way.

3384170,3,B00164KYV4,"Five very likable couples that have some connection to one another traverse the choppy waters of romance in Baltimore. That's the short of the new romantic comedy - drama ""He's Just Not That Into You"". And it is an interesting, if entirely unoriginal idea. But the filmmakers take some good, interesting elements and make the story funnier and more enjoyable than it has a right to be.

In a film like this, with so many characters, a film attempting to make light of and dramatize the many aspects of romance, you know that every character is going to have one aspect of a personality. There are simply too many people for the writers and director to be able to delve into any of the characters in any depth. When the writers and directors have the skill to create more than a few real life, fully rounded, believable characters, you know you are in the hands of people with real talent. Usually, the end result is something magical. ""He's Just Not..."" is not magical, but it has a few funny moments. And these moments are made all the more enjoyable by the likable cast.

Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) are very much in love and have been together for seven years. But Beth wants to get married and Neil doesn't believe in it. Can Beth accept the status of their relationship and continue on, or will she jeopardize the relationship by insisting on marriage? Ben (Bradley Cooper) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly) are married, but aren't particularly happy. Janine seems to be more interested in renovating their house. When Ben meets Anna (Scarlett Johannson), a yoga teacher who wants to be a singer, he finds an undeniable attraction to her. But he doesn't want to jeopardize his marriage. But what if Anna is the love of his life? Mary (Drew Barrymore) works at ad sales for Baltimore's gay weekly and gets most of her dating advice from her gay co-workers. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), the film's guide, goes on a blind date with Conor (Kevin Connolly), a realtor. She is sure he will call back, but he is more interested in going out with Anna, a girl he is clearly infatuated with. Distraught, Gigi decides to visit a spot Conor told her he hangs out at, a restaurant owned by Alex (Justin Long), a womanizer who is also Conor's friend. He likes Gigi and decides to become her romantic guide.

So, it's all very predictable. But director Ken Kwapis (who has recently been directing episodes of ""The Office"") and writers Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein manage to generate a few laughs and make most of the characters at least interesting.

But all of this good will begins to evaporate. And evaporate very quickly. With five different 'couples', we have five different and distinct story lines. Yes, they overlap, but not a lot. So the film sets up a Round Robin-type of exposition. First we meet all five couples and learn why they are in this Rom Com Dram. The very broad strokes. Then, we start to explore their lives with them, delving deeper into the problems. Then we revisit them. Unfortunately, a lot of these 'visits' start to become very repetitive. A couple has an argument and then breaks up. We see the male living out of the apartment. We see the female unhappy. Will they get back together? Of course. But we have to sit through a number of scenes of each of them unhappy. What about Janine's discovery that Ben might be smoking. First, she accuses Ben. When he denies it, she turns to their foreman (Luis Guzman). She seems to accept the mystery of the cigarettes, but every time we see her, she either mentions them or looks at them or talks about them. This is used to illustrate the state of their relationship, but it really just illustrates the state of our fatigue at sitting in the theater for so long. Conor pursues Anna and wants to have a committed relationship with her. But she is attracted to Ben. And he can't sleep with her because it would affect his marriage. These three circle each other, engaging in various conversations. Soon, it really seems like some scenes are being repeated, almost verboten. And it becomes a chore to sit through the film.

A big part of the problem is the film is too long. Way too long, by like 30 or 40 minutes. At 129 minutes (it seems longer), this romantic comedy/ drama has too much time on its hands giving it the luxury to rehash stories and ideas we have already seen. If the film were, say, 90 minutes, a lot of this repetition would be impossible and the film would seem funnier (because the laughs would be more closely spaced together) and overall better (because everything would move at a faster pace.

Producer Drew Barrymore and her business partner Nancy Juvonen are smart producers. Adapting a 'self-help' book in to a fictional romantic comedy/ drama seems like an iffy proposition at best. But they clearly saw that it could work and adapting the former mega bestseller into a movie has now created a hugely popular movie going experience. Barrymore and Juvonen are also behind the ""Charlie's Angels"" films. So, they clearly recognize material that will draw people to the multiplex. It's too bad they can't recognize quality material and bring better films to the same legions of people so willing to drop $10 for a movie ticket.

Throughout the film, there are a number of moments when the screen flashes a line, presumably a bon mote of self-help gleamed from the bestseller. Then, we watch as a random person tells a quick story about their romantic life meant to illustrate this statement. Why are random people talking to us? Some of these moments are funny, but wouldn't it be a better idea to use the well-known actors you already have in the film for these moments? It would also help to make us more familiar with these same characters as we would get another little glimpse into their characters. Too bad. A wasted opportunity. As they stand, these moments only serve to make the film seem even longer.

""He's Just Not That Into You"" is a good date movie. But I would really recommend renting it on DVD and forcing your boyfriend to watch it with you at home. He will quickly become so bored he will agree to do anything for you. You could probably get him to clean the house, bake a pie, run the vacuum.

Her embarrassing attempts at securing ""the one"" are so realistic you will likely find yourself reddening at the all too familiar lengths to which she goes.

Best line from the movie: Listen out for the line the guy uses who ends up with Gigi (won't say who ;-)), it could be the ""You complete me"" of the 21st century!

Disclaimer:
This film may cause some discomfort. Side effects are generally mild and may include feelings of embarrassment over previous postdate obsession/stalking.

3384173,5,B00164KYV4,"I went with my best friend of 22 years.  It was like watching a movie of our lives in our single days.  We laughed out loud at all the stupid and embarrassing things the characters did and said in the movie - the very same things we said and did back in the day.  We sat by the phone waiting for it to ring, picked it up to make sure it was working, spent an eternity over drinks analyzing and picking apart everything the guy who never called said.  I think it was spot on.  I would not, however, recommend this as a dating movie - this is one for the girls' night out.  Enjoy, ladies!",1234137600,4,586,4.008620689655173
3384174,4,B00164KYV4,"It's not that often that you see a mainstream movie which draws groups of single women like moths to a flame.  Not surprising considering the movie's genesis from a phrase in one episode of Sex and the City, and the book of the same name.

Not that this would necessarily make a great date movie. It's more of a go see with your friend movie.

It boasts a promising ensemble cast with Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Ginnifer Goodwin, Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and others.

As we go deeper into the movie, we get caught up in the familiar stories and situations of these characters.  The central theme characters are played by Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love) as Gigi, and Justin Long as Alex (Live Free or Die Hard,and the Mac Guy from the tv ads), the wise bar manager with the knowing male perspective, who knows the dating code, and can tell instantly when he's not into her, and when she's not into him.

So he mentors Gigi, jilted and frustrated in love, a universal character most of us will recognise and perhaps empathise with. He even offers to set her up with his friend, but does Alex have feelings for her.

In contrast Conor played by Kevin Connolly from Entourage, plays the guy looking for the right relationship, yet inexplicably gets put back in the friend zone by Scarlett Johansson's character, but can he get out of that zone?

One of the biggest laughs comes when Jennifer Connelly's character breaks the mirror, and what happens next.

Most insightful is the long term relationship between Jennifer Aniston's and Ben Affleck's character, seven years together. If a guy says he does not want to ever get married, do you stick with him and hope he will change, or do you move on?

With Scarlett Johansson's slippery slope storyline, both sides of the story unfold, it does take two to tangle, and it is cautionary. Unfortunately, I have known a few restless guys like this guy.  It's not personal, it's just human nature.

One lesson from the movie could be whether women read too much into minor actions.  He said 'It was nice meeting you,' but what does that mean?  Does it mean he's interested, or is it merely a brush off. As Freud said eventually: Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar..

In contrast men do not pick up on minor signs, and so we tend not to give minor signs either. We tend to be obvious.  If a guy does not call, it means he's lost your number (it does happen), or maybe he doesn't feel he deserves you, or he's unavailable, which means he's just not that into you.

On the other hand if we are interested, we operate in a vacuum, because we cannot read the signs. So, how do we know if they are really into us. Then there's the fine balance of how often, and when to call.

If we don't conform to some preconceived idea of behavior this delicate flower of burgeoning attraction becomes overwatered and dies, or underwatered and shrivels. If we call and they don't call back, what does that mean?

So, we men are really in the same boat, aren't we?

I hope this is helpful.",1234051200,6,3049,4.539305301645339
3384175,3,B00164KYV4,"Is it the feel-bad movie of the year? Although it's disguised as a Valentine's Day chick flick, and the advertising tries to convince guys that it isn't filled exclusively with mushy stuff, it's certainly not fun-loving. Exposing, analyzing and patronizing complex relationships, He's Just Not That Into You is a startlingly relatable film that alternates between reasonably entertaining and ""drudging up bad memories."" It's more sophisticated than you might think and the humor, which is fairly consistent, doesn't resort to raunchiness. The dating crowd will want to take note, however, that this isn't the type of movie you want to watch with your significant other, as you'll both probably leave feeling guilty, paranoid, overly inquisitive, or all three.

The film follows several relationships, each one originally independent of the other, until they all seem to collide at the conclusion. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) assumes the stereotype of the pathetic, desperate girl, who obsessively waits for her many dates to call her back. She resorts to begging, stalking, and other degrading acts to win the attentions of multiple guys, each one shrugging her off. Alex (Justin Long), a friendly and experienced bar manager, steps in to give Gigi a few pointers on her depressing failure with the opposite sex. Relying too heavily on his advice and his playful concern, she starts to think Alex is interested in her, leading to even more angst. Their story is the most interesting, considering Alex's often eye-opening advice and the humor in Gigi's failings.

Ben (Bradley Cooper) was rushed into marriage with his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and resultantly falls for the sensual flirtations of Anna (Scarlett Johansson). After a quick seduction, Ben realizes he's destroying the relationship with his wife, but Anna is fixed on the idea that Ben could be her true love. Meanwhile, Conor (Kevin Connolly) is wondering why Anna, who is his current girlfriend, won't sleep with him. This section of the film is the most serious, with tragic and emotional twists at every turn.

Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) have been happily in love for seven years, but when her younger sister announces wedding plans, Beth begins to question why she hasn't been proposed to. Neil doesn't believe in marriage, but Beth feels it's a necessity - leading to doubts, heartbreak and the most unlikely segment of the film.

There are an additional few love stories thrown in, each involving several of the characters from the major three plot lines. Perhaps the most inspiring piece of He's Just Not That Into You is the storytelling approach, which carefully intertwines almost every single character - by the end of the film, it's really just one complex story. The problem is that a series of serious relationships that are falling apart, getting glued back together, or never having a chance to develop, is occasionally not varied enough to keep audiences amused.

The large and recognizable cast is delightful to see, introducing a new familiar face every ten minutes, and the humor is universal and doesn't resort to cheap yucks. The film puts on display every single stereotype, mold, rule, exception, and dilemma of relationships; some are predictable while others are surprising, but the whole spectrum is present. Told chiefly from a woman's perspective (guys are terrible and dishonest most of the time, although at certain points the men get their more unbiased viewpoint portrayed) He's Just Not That Into You is likely to rub a great many people the wrong way. It's not a date movie by any means, but it's also not as unintelligent as it appears.

3384243,1,B00164KYV4,"Review of He's Just Not That Into You
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? It reminded me of one of those Garry Marshall films named after a holiday with all-star casts, each on the screen for about ten minutes, and each luring hopefully enough people to the theaters on opening weekend to make up the cost of their salary. Only, instead of an incredibly goopy layer of cheese mixed in with each vignette, Hes Just Not That Into You is dipped in cynicism and hopelessness.

Why would anyone want to go see a movie in which several couples and hopeful couples try like Hades to make their relationships work, only to have infidelity, cruelty, and general disinterest get in the way? Even during a man-bashing girls weekend with Cosmos and chocolate, I cant imagine enjoying this two-hour smear of searching for love.",1497225600,2,855,4.618421052631579

I remember cringing at some points in the film because you kind of know how things are going to play out and I am not one who likes to see people walk into an embarrassing situation or make a fool of themselves.

As we mature, we go through a number of stages when it comes to relationships.  We meet people whom we like and are compatible with, and we meet people we like but just aren't a good match.  Sometimes we meet people we think are 'the one', and sometimes they are, well, just not into you.

This is a good comedy-drama, that manages to hit a lot of good notes.  The acting is good and I especially enjoyed the Ben Affleck-Jennifer Aniston relationship.

3384708,5,B00164KYV4,"I've had a crush on Jennifer Connelly since I saw her in the Labyrinth.  The mature version is still appealing.  The pleasant surprise is how realistic the experiences of these fictional characters are analogous with every-day life.  Then there were the pop-up interviews and side line (friendship) psycho-analysis, where the daily associates basically eviscerate any pretensions that our heroines might be clinging to.  (Like playing phone tag, and voice-mail tag, and e-mail tag, and texting, and my-spacing and only to get rejected by all these different technologies!)

It's absolutely glorious to watch a non-religious comedic romance drama that etches out the premise (and sticks to it), that workable conjugal relationship always depends on putting the beloved other ahead of our own selfish impulses.  Not to mention highlighting the chaotic norm that what we most yearn for and need, usually isn't on the greener, grassier, other side of the fence, but inexplicably, directly in front of us.

3384761,3,B00164KYV4,"Hes Just Not That Into You is billed as a romantic comedy but it might better be considered as a romantic drama.  It is a little too real, a little too painful to be in the same class as the lighter, fluffier, funnier efforts like the recent What Happens In Vegas.  The new to me actress Ginnifer Goodwin is at the center of the interlocking stories in the movie.  She is too obsessed, too insecure and too desperate to be much fun.  All of the women in the movie, it is a movie by and for women, are a trifle too driven to find true love.  It makes them crazy.
 The ensemble cast is super.  Ben Affleck proves he can actually act a part in what I think is his best role ever.  Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore and Scarlet Johansson all do an exceptional job.  Jennifer Connelly has perhaps the most challenging acting assignment and is well on top of the task.  She is the only married woman in the story and must portray a woman betrayed but game to stick it out.
 Justin Long (the Apple guy in the long running commercials on TV) shows that he has the chops to be a romantic lead.  Kris Kristofferson has a small role as Anistons dad.  All of these actors do a terrific job and it is a pleasure to watch them.
 For me, a romantic at heart, there was too much focus on the down side of love, the betrayals, misunderstandings and the unbearable pain of love gone wrong.  But it is very well done, and there are uplifting and funny parts to provide balance.
 It is number two this week at the box office, bringing in a tidy $62million world wide so far.  The PG-13 film runs two hours and nine minutes.  With three saw blades, this is not the top banana in the genre, but the great performances make it worth seeing.",1414713600,,1716,4.243827160493828

3384857,1,B00164KYV4,The main female characters in the movie bend over backwards for the males in the story and the males give no effort.  All the women who ended up with someone only did because the man just knocked of their boot. This movie portrays women as the one who do the dirt word in a relationship while the men just show up when they feel like it. Which is not at all how real relationships are. Both parties should be working hard and willing to make sacrifices.,1396656000,2,453,4.267441860465116

3384863,4,B00164KYV4,It was a fun movie about the way women and men interact. The misconceptions and differences in language. It's not exactly romantic but has some of that too.

3384879,5,B00164KYV4,It is about a group of people that have different experiences with romantic relationships.  It helps them to see that 'friendship' is the beginning to all real solid romantic relationships.  Each character in the story realizes something about either the relationship they have or the relationship that they hope for that ultimately helps them connect with someone they had not expected to be what they are actually looking for in a romantic relationship.  It helped them face some realities about their romantic relationship and determine if it is a healthy one.  The end result is everyone finds happiness or an opportunity to look forward to it.,1393632000,,648,5.084905660377358

3384933,2,B00164KYV4,"I love romantic comedies, and this style in particular. But most of the relationships seemed either excessively superficial and more than a little whiny. But what devastates the rating was the Jennifer Aniston storyline. Spoiler alert, but it's important to understanding why this movie is not good. That relationship has been going on for years and is fine, except that she wants to get married at some point, and he doesn't see the point in marriage. This turns into a big conflict and they break up over it. Here's the part that gets me: Jennifer Aniston's character comes back telling herself that she's actually okay with staying with the guy and not getting married even though it's what she wants. She gives up the thing that she wants for this guy. Yes, it's true that afterward he proposes, but it doesn't change the how incredibly selfish he is. She cares about getting married and he doesn't care. If he doesn't care, why can he not just go through with it since it matters to her? A refusal to do something your partner cares about when you don't care is nothing but selfish. And this movie tries to romanticize that. Dreck and drivel.",1383868800,,1147,4.683168316831683

3384946,3,B00164KYV4,"Romantic comedies are tough - no matter - in this postmodern, cynical world.  This one tries its very best, with an all-star A list cast, but ultimately it's a talkfest without any real surprises or treats to satisfy viewers.  Nothing bad about it but, then again, nothing very memorable. For $1.99 it's basically eye-candy.  Only one noteworthy performance: Jennifer Connolly is so unlikeable she should sue her agent for putting her in a frothy romantic comedy where she's clearly a fish out of water.",1382918400,,503,4.964285714285714

I've watched this several times since, by choice, on my own. It's just an honestly funny movie about dating and relationships. It spans all through first dates to marriage, from hot, artsy chicks to girls next door, suave guys to pricks. There are sketches during random parts of the film of impromptu moments of regular people (and famous people) commenting on a particular theme- ""when she won't sleep with you..."" and things like that. Genius. It's a great way to make the film even more tangible on a realistic level.
I'm not the biggest fan of some of the actors in this, but the writing and directing of this far surpass any issues I have with actors. So even if you hate the color pink, or refuse to drop your metallica collection from your ipod, just take a night and watch this, even if it's in private. If you've ever had even the mildest bump in a relationship, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.",1374796800,2,1145,4.509615384615385

Ginnifer Godwin's character is the lead and she draws you in...very engaging and hopeful.  She aches for someone to love and someone to love her, and no matter how many times she tries and misses, she still tries.  She meets Justin Long's character who seems to be the first honest man she's met.  Their friendship is the leading plot in the movie that has a lot of subplots...all of which are fun, fascinating character studies.

The list of excellent actors in ""He's just not that into you"" goes on and on.  The acting, as well as the writing, is wonderful.  I won't bore you with my rendition of the stories, but I will highly recommend this movie!",1372032000,,855,4.542483660130719

Right as the movie begins we are introduced to lots of characters ( with very well known Hollywood names).

Get the scorecard- but only if you think you are going to care about keeping track of these couples, or people trying to couple.

After you meet them all, you then get to learn about their relationship problems.

Problems that we should care about, but don't.

 Well, for me that  was a bad sign right off the bat.

I don't have any interest in these characters or their issues.

 Why am I watching this again?  Is this movie going to get any better?

 Yawn- ho- hum.....Who has the chips bag? Pass me the soda will ya?

Oh, yeah back to this movie.

If you think this is going to be as humorous as the book or audio recording of the book- forget it.

In the mood for a rom-com?

This is not it.

 It's not funny and with the exception of one couple in the plot, it is not romantic either.

It is also a chick flick.  CHICK FLICK. NOTHING IN IT FOR THE MEN. NOTHING- ZERO- ZIPPO- NADA.

EXCEPT FOR CATCHING A FEW ZZZZZZSSSSS BECAUSE THEY ARE BOUND TO FALL ASLEEP IF YOU PUT THIS ON.

 Guys don't dig most chick flicks- but a really bad chick flick, is up there with other forms of male torture.

3385043,5,B00164KYV4,"This is one of my favorite romantic movies.  I think Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ONCE-UPON-A-TIME/dp/B005XN3150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ONCE UPON A TIME</a>) is amazing here, Ben Affleck too, everyone in top form, including Bradley Cooper, though playing an unlikable character, and charming Justin Long as Ginnifer Goodwin's love interest (Long played the nerdy teen advising Tim Allen & Sigourney Weaver via communicator-""Just push the blue button!""- in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest/dp/B007QA3AH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest</a>). Though there are multiple stories told, the characters are well-developed, in relation to each other, in many pithy, seminal scenes.  Great, natural dialogue.

Personally, I think this movie superior to LOVE, ACTUALLY- more natural, less contrived.  Note, for example, the great subtlety and yet significance of the scene in which Bradley Cooper declines Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette.  Another reason I love this is the strong chemistry between all the characters, friends as well as lovers.  And the ending- where all the loose ends are tied up- not just one happy ending but several- perfectly punctuated by Keane's marvelous ""Somewhere Only We Know"", followed by the Cure, wonderful (the music throughout the film is great).  And be SURE to stay tuned for the credits, because the movie continues for a few minutes after they begin to roll, indeed, some of the best scenes.

I read a few of the negative reviews and on reflection, I must say that I didn't find this movie funny either- honest, charming and moving, yes- funny, no.

I enjoyed the deleted scenes, hearing the director's rationale for deleting them.  They would've detracted from the flow, true, but provide great backstory so watch them if you like the film (btw, the one with Scarlett Johannson singing in the cocktail lounge appears to have been filmed in the Observation Bar on the Queen Mary).  There's an entire subplot involving Johansson's character, with Theresa Russell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Widow/dp/B00AGE5P0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Widow</a>) playing her mother- intriguing, and very interesting why director Ken Kwapis decided to cut it.  Only one small quibble do I have about the movie, and that involves being taken aback by some of the awful hair styles sported by the women (Goodwin and Johansson in particular), and in some cases, poor makeup (and/or lighting).  Granted, everybody doesn't have to look perfect all the time, but it's quite a feat to make these beautiful women look haggard, as they do in several scenes (not Goodwin, she's radiant, it's her hair that's atrocious).  But that's minor- this movie has romance, heart, charm, and wisdom, in my humble opinion.  Granted, it's not exactly a feminist manifesto, but even so, it makes some VERY incisive observations about relations between the sexes.  I dare say a large percentage of people in this world spend an inordinate amount of time looking for someone to love and love them, the central theme of the film.

There was one misstep in that in one scene Johannson storms out of Ben's office without bothering to put her dress back on, that might have raised a few eyebrows.  Lastly, I would have found it satisfying had Jennifer Connolly ended up with Javier, but that didn't happen, darn it.

I am not a romantic comedy buff, but I do like my movies to at least follow a theme through to the end.  this one negated itself and made me feel like I wasted a whopping 2 HOURS and change.

It is an all around great film about relationship building, finding love and having the support of family and friends all in a silly & sometimes whacky environment but it all makes sense. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" will make you laugh or possibly cry because the characters are believable and likeable with the extreme capability of drawing you into their troubles. The film comes full circle and there is a happy ending. I truly enjoyed it and think you will as well. 5 Stars.

Otherwise, you are a ""right now"" type of girl. This movie shows how both sexes act around the opposite sex.

Also, pay attention to the in between scenes in the movie, where they cut away to people who are not in the movie -- those scenes are hilarious, but oh so true!

The main female character is so helplessly in love, that her pathetic attempts at wooing men lead to embarrassingly hilarious situations that keep you laughing, despite the sadly flailing relationships of some of the other stories.

3385152,3,B00164KYV4,"Last night's bargain rack movie was the ""He's Just Not Into You"" DVD. I guess it was supposed to be a romantic comedy, but if it was there weren't many laughs. The movie was set up such that it supposedly offered advice to single women regarding single men. Personally, I thought the movie was insulting to single people, in general, and especially to single women. I can say this because I was a single person for over 50 years beyond puberty until I finally got married. Believe me, I know what the single life is like. I actually felt sorry for the very attractive single women depicted in this movie and I felt embarrassment at the depiction of the men. A comedy? Maybe a laugh track was needed so that the audience could tell when it was supposed to be funny.

The production values of the film were fairly high. The photography was good. The sound track was okay. The acting of most of the characters was actually fairly good to excellent in a lot of places. Unfortunately, the cast was burdened with a pathetic story line. Almost every cliche of single life was dwelled upon at length. The movie was boring and embarrassing at the same time. I longed for the end. This DVD will go into the trash. I couldn't bear watching it again and I would never lend it to a friend for viewing.

3385168,2,B00164KYV4,"After an hour or so into He's Just Not That Into You and I found that I was not that into it because it was boring, pretentious, clichd ad nauseam and insulting to both female and male audiences.  The movie is populated with the pathetic women who just talk and talk about their relationships or the lack of them, and are needy, desperate, and super-annoying. Infantile men, scary of commitments or those who are in the relationship but could not remember why they actually wanted to be in one. Plus, it has nothing to do with the comedies. It is totally not funny and anti-romantic. Just imagine Sex and the City with no sex, Love, actually with NO Love at all, actually, and When Harry Met Sally with the main characters absolutely unlikable and lifeless. I finished watching the whole thing hoping that it would improve and give me something to like in it. The only story that I found a notch better than the rest was that of Neil and Beth (Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck), who have been together for seven years, love each other but are not married because Neil does not believe in marriage. Both actors were convincing in the story that was not as annoying as the rest of them.

But for the most of the time, I was not into the movie's characters at all. I read the plot of the movie in Wiki and in writing it does not look as irritating and boring as the film. Then I found out that the film was based on the bestselling book by two Sex and the City scribes (that explains the similarities between two), Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. I read some of it and liked it a lot.  So, what went wrong with the movie?  Were the actors trying too much) or 2+ hours running time was way too long? As the result, the movie is simply lifeless and plain with no sparks or romance, and, sadly, even the all-stars cast could not save it.",1324944000,2,1832,4.347953216374269

Just when we feel like we are getting it, the movie abandons all that to mostly happy endings with reluctant guys coming completely around to total commitment of love. Some of the characters don't quite go that way, and there is some good acting. Many of the turns make no sense, like Ben Affleck's change of heart. He has no problem with commitment, but strongly is against marriage. What does he do when Aniston pines for him, but won't be with him without getting married? You guessed it Hollywood, he asks her to marry him! We never get to see the complexities of him selling out on his beliefs or overcoming whatever created them, he just does it and she's happy. Playboy Justin Long's sudden realization that he's in love with Gigi ain't romantic, it's just ridiculous. Furthermore, we never get to see any reason Bradley Cooper would even like his wife, as she's just one-dimensionally dour. This he is just not into it at all.",1324080000,,1106,4.6479591836734695

I don't actually know any women who ever felt like a man was a mandatory necessity in life, nor do I know any women this ""girly,"" so these women are strange & unrealistic to me.

In other words, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU stars every Generation Xer in Hollywood--with the exception of Ashton Kutcher.  Why Ashton lucked out, one can only wonder.

Here we have a meandering, colossal ensemble of intertwining story lines and sub-plots--all having to do with how miserable love makes us.  What sends this film to terminal yawn status has to do with the sheer number of story lines and sub-plots; after half an hour the viewer just becomes exhausted trying to keep up with all of them.  If I had had a vote (which I didn't) I would have promptly jettisoned the Connelly-Cooper-Johansson love triangle, as none of the three characters are remotely likable.  (I heard a Wicked Witch of the West cackle every time Connelly appeared on screen; can we say the word ""severe""?)  The most interesting story line centers around Goodwin's hard luck character falling for Long's character--who views their relationship as purely platonic.  Or does he?  Or do we really care?

Don't answer that.

3385206,2,B00164KYV4,"Overall, this movie did not translate well from book to screen because the dramatic hit home of the lessons was lost in a poorly written and executed story.
I read the book several years ago, and found myself hugely disappointed it hadn't  been written when I was much much younger because it would have saved me a lot of wasted energy on the wrong men (or at least a lot of them).
The movie followed five different women with brief follows on three of their men, some of them friends with each other, and their relationships or lack of, and issues with men.  I understand the idea of using female characters to relay the messages. However, I found the implementation of that, sort of a let down.  A lot of the lessons were lost.  I wasn't drawn in to the characters and their lives.  They seemed uninteresting, sort of wishy washy, and they did not truly evolve as chracters, which is the whole point of the story.
The one woman, who wants to get married, breaks up with her bfriend of seven years because he hasn't made the move towards marriage, ends up letting go of her marriage dream and gets back together with him.  So where is the lesson or real growth from her character?  Because I was confused.  Is it that she was too hung up on being married?  I don't know.  Didn't make sense to me.
So for me, this was a let down.  If you really want the lessons, read the book instead.",1292630400,,1385,4.3501945525291825
3385207,5,B00164KYV4,"Dating can be quite stressful considering all of the expectations and concerns each individual brings to every new relationship. For this reason, it is no surprise that many romantic comedies focus on helping viewers laugh at relationship complexities. The comic relief is nice and entertaining, but not usually insightful. In contrast, the movie, He's Just Not That Into You, with its all-star cast, is the most thought-provoking film in its genre.  Viewers glean insights from this film's many lessons on how to determine the level of interest in another person and how to evaluate one's own feelings about potential partners. The movie causes the audience to ponder why women sometimes tolerate being treated poorly by men, what constitutes a happy ending, and whether taking relationship advice from friends is a wise choice. The nine main characters lives are intertwined as friends, roommates, co-workers, and chance encounters, while representing various stages of relationships. The characters evaluate their current relationships and eventually learn that rules do not apply when other people's emotions are involved. Instead, they must realize their own worth and discover their individual needs and desires while waiting for a person who recognizes their worth and values it too. This movie helps people consider the balance that needs to exist between the random nature of relationships and pursuing goals with a purpose. Finally, the film urges people to avoid focusing on the fairy tale version of a happy ending, but rather on an ending that is right for them.",1292112000,,1575,5.325301204819277

3385210,3,B00164KYV4,"HJSNTIY is a girl movie at heart, so I was biased from the get-go. However, as the film unfolded I found myself drawn in, like a puppy to a bowl of 'forbidden' food. The movie follows several different characters as they search for true love. One couple is married (Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper). One couple doesn't necessarily believe in marriage (Ben Afleck and Jennifer Anniston). Two girls just want to be a couple (Gennifer Goodwin and Drew Barrymore). Two guys also want to be couples, though they don't know it yet (Kevin Connolly and Justin Long). And then there's one girl (Scarlett Johansson) that's just disgusting in her actions. And that's not all of the stars that are in the movie, but you get the point.

Anyway, the film is basically a mosaic at first, presenting the viewer with a quote that happens to set the scene for what's coming up. This mosaic introduces you to the many, many different characters that are all indirectly inter-related. People start to date or fall apart or whatever. And then the second half of the movie throws the ""quote"" thing out the window and follows the choices the people have made.

My problem with this movie was that there were too many characters, or too many connections. I can handle that when it's presented over a long bout of time (like in Lost), but when it's crammed into a 2-hour spot it's too much. It's like A and B are together, but B falls for C, who happens to be with D, who is best friends with E. F and G are in a relationship, and G is B's best friend. H is looking for a relationship and gets help and advice from her co-workers, A and F. And that's not even half of it. I'm sure the creators used some sort of flow chart or matrix to work everything out. Overall, the plot was semi-interesting, but I only really cared about a few of the characters.

They are broken up for the majority of the film, and no one, including the actors played by Aniston and Affleck, are quite sure why.

In this misguided endeavor (the only thing really clever about it is the title), it's hard to tell which gender comes off worse - the women, who are all portrayed as needy, insecure, controlling, man-hungry whiners, or the men, who are all inconsiderate, self-centered louts.  And this battle-of-the-sexes face-off goes on for a grueling two hours and nine minutes.

The specific details of the romantic roundelay the characters put us through doesn't really bear repeating here.  Suffice it to say that the actors do what they can with the material - the movie was written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (based on the novel by Greg Berhrendt and Liz Tuccillo) and directed by Ken Kwapis - and that most of the characters manage to see the errors of their ways in time for the obligatory happy ending (could that possibly qualify as a plot ""spoiler""?  Only if you have never seen a romantic comedy before, I suppose).  Barrymore does get off a few choice lines about how hard it is to date in a world dominated by email, cell phones, text messaging, voicemail, and a whole host of other technological gadgets that actually make communication MORE difficult rather than less so, but that's pretty much it in the laughs department.

And a couple of other points:  why is it that, in a movie that takes place in a modern urban setting, the producers couldn`t cast even one person of color in a major role (there are plenty of them in the background appearing as waiters, however)?  And what's with all the gay guys, with their limp-wristed affectations and ""You go, girl!"" theatrics?  Frankly, I thought we'd gotten past all that by this point.  It isn't even a matter of being politically correct; it`s a matter of creating a credible environment for the movie to tell its story in.

""He's Just Not That Into You"" has been yet another dating training film, and while we laugh at the mildly amusing we are supposed to see ourselves in these situations and change our behaviors.  It is a shame that we put ourselves in these situations, but not that funny that we really do delude ourselves into thinking that something will come of a man who is, simply, not that into us.

The funniest, and most pathetic, is that of GiGi, who shows up at a bar wanting to return some guy's pen in the hopes of seeing him again.  In a not so ironic twist, the bar owner, Justin Long, becomes her romantic interest even though she talks to him as if he is her therapist before he too rejects her and he inevitably realizes that he likes her as well.  Drew Barrymore is guided through her minor trials and tribulations by her army of gays, her funniest scene is when they listen to her botched voice mails from her MySpace antics.  Jennifer Aniston has been living with her boyfriend for the last seven years and he's simply ""not into marriage"", causing her much stress.  And Scarlette Johansen is having an affair with a married man, believing within that he will leave his wife for her while his wife, Jennifer Connelly, is at home suffering.

Okay, there's an all-star cast, and I suppose they tried their best. The plot is weak and flickers half-heartedly, with little surges at a heart-touching moment ending up ruined. I felt like the director and the writers and everybody had a great idea, but it just got bogged down with weird plot twists and dull dialog.

I sat down to watch this movie, expecting something much more light and, well, romantic. It looks and sounds like a cute movie. Yet the humor they stab just ends up making us cringe, and the ""truths"" they sift in their about men and women are all, frankly, stupid and unrealistic.

The movie makes men look like disgusting dogs, and women look like lousy Bambi-eyed stupidheads, in a third grader's words. It had a heart, trust me, but it's just very bizarre. Like, let's watch a man fall in love with a not-so-innocent blond, or a hopeless girl fall in love several times, only to learn from a male friend that each one isn't interested, and gives her dating tips (which seems weird on its own). I mean, I feel like there's too many characters in an overly-complicated, weird plot that just doesn't click with me.

So if this is such a horrible movie, why did I rate it more than one star? Because it's honestly not a horrible movie. It started out good, but kinda degraded (it really lost me with the man-leaving-his-wife-for-the-younger-girl part). It has a few touching parts, granted, and though a nontraditional ending, it's still predictable and feels kinda hollow. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can watch it if you like, but don't buy it. I don't plan on watching it again- and just be ready for a cliche, bizarre movie stamped with the false ""funny/romance"" sticker on its spine.",1262304000,3,1813,4.603715170278638
3385248,5,B00164KYV4,"It's interesting to me that there were so many bad reviews for this movie and that people thought it was so horrible.  It is one of the first Romantic Comedy movies in a long time that I just smiled at the end.  There was a realness for me to the stories in the movie.  I think that so often people want to deny how many (not all) men and women are wired and what they do.  I've heard stories like the ones in this movie.  In fact, although my husband and I didn't live together before we got married and we met and married in 6 months, there is a scene in the movie that reminded me of just how my husband proposed to me.  A few weeks ago he was telling me about how he'd shared our story with someone and it sounded so romantic.  But, it was a long time ago and I hadn't thought of it that way in a long time.  But, this movie reminded me of why it was romantic.  The scene in this movie was romantic.

And I loved the ending.  A lot of people seemed to not like Gigi's character, but I've known a lot of women like her and when I was single, I know I wanted to call guys who didn't call.  I even got stood up twice by a guy once.  I genuinely thought he had just forgotten the first time.  I didn't really think he'd show up the second time.  It happens to everyone.  And I went on a lot of dates when I was single--I wasn't desperate or chasing any guys, but it does happen that you get stood up or misled.

I think one of the greatest strengths of this movie is that most romantic movies and books make it seem as if being married and in a relationship is the answer to everything.  The ending to this movie makes it clear in a good way that it's not.  My mom always told me that it's better not to be married, than to be married to the wrong person--she didn't mean that you should just leave someone if you're unhappy, but that just wanting to get married isn't a good reason to get married--if it isn't the right person.  She also gave me another piece of advice--that when you're on your own, you can't run away from yourself--you have to face who you are.

All that said, I did fast forward a few of the sex scenes because I just didn't want to watch them.  I just didn't enjoy watching Scarlett Johanssen's character and her storyline--I'm glad they deleted the scenes that they did.

Give this movie a chance, it's a lot better than the title sounds.",1262217600,3,2362,4.086956521739131
3385249,3,B00164KYV4,"This silly chick flick was on my cable TV channel and there was nothing else to watch.  Simply put, the title, which is the name of a self-help book, says it all.  This is a pleasant film that is not supposed to be great.  It's just a simple story with a star studded cast and a plot that includes several romances.  Acting is good, the story moves fast and it's a pleasure to see such stars as Jennifer Anniston, Ben Affleck, Scarlet Johanson, Jennifer Connoly and Ginnifer Goodwin (of ""Big Love"") going through the ups and downs of trying to find love.

There is nothing special about this film.  It is as predictable as I expected it to be.  But sometimes it's not a bad thing to just relax and let myself be amused, especially if its on TV and it didn't cost me anything.

It's funny but it is very serious at times.  I laughed at the blunt, sometimes cruel behavior of men in this movie.  Yes I have done some of these things.  And I laughed at the behaviors of the women who just can't get it right.  Gigi was a little bit overboard though but I know people exist like that.  The one thing that stuck out in this movie was Scarlett Johansson's character.  I meet women like this every day.  I work with a ton of them.  She had a perfectly good guy, who adored her, standing right in front of her and she totally overlooked him.  I hear the same women complaining that they can't find a good guy meanwhile I know what they did.  It's a shame.  Sometimes people can't get out of their own way.  Good realistic romantic comedy.  It's not one of those clown funny movies with stupid antics and situations.  It's reality.  And that's what's funny about this movie.

Oh, women can be cruel as well.  They don't touch on that in this movie but it does happen.

I wish I would have went to the movies to see this. It was pretty good in my opinion.

In between getting songs for my iPod, I was glued to the movie. I wanted to see what happened to the broken-hearted girl. I wanted to see if she would ever get it right. I wanted to see if the guy who was almost forced into marriage would be less of a sleaze.

I'm sure there is nothing new I could say about this dating movie that hasn't been said before. So I'll just say that it's worth it in the end and if you are interested in watching people trying to date and work various things out in their relationships, then this is the movie for you.

Everyone seems to know everyone through a person or two. And some of them even leave ""dates"" for another in the next second.

Overall, I thought it was worth the watch.

This ensemble romantic piece is never very funny or moving and there are a million movies out there which can generate more laughs or tears, but at the same time I couldn't bring myself to hate it; sure it has no real ambition towards being a good film and waslittle more than a mercenary attempt to get couples into theaters around Valentine's Day, but it's watchable and never mean-spirited, so if you want something stupid to watch with your date you could do worse.

It's got charm, wit, sweetness, enough embarrassing moments to make you fall in love twice!  Yeah, it has some (just a tiny bit) educational value if you want to go there but it's a chick flick first.  Just to comment on that note, I've only heard of the book and skimmed through it at the bookstore but from what I can see, the movie covers the basic truths in the book.  The movie centers around the dating life of Gigi (played absolutely adorably by Ginnifer Goodwin) and then through the couples that surround Gigi.  The relationships covered in the movie include: desperately dating, married, almost married, kind of dating, secretly dating and cluelessly dating.  That's covered'em all, right?  I'd like to comment on all the beautiful casts like the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, rigid and hilarious (yes, she's hilarious!)  Jennifer Connelly and countless others but my heart must go out to Ginnifer Goodwin and I'm woman enough to admit that I have at one time or another went through what she goes through in the movie - which, of course, made me root for her even more (Watch the movie ladies and you'll know what I'm talking about).  This girl makes all the right mistakes but here's the big catch - it all ends well.  And it was so satisfying to see the happy ending especially after all the turmoil and torture of dating that Gigi goes through.  I'm being straight with you.

3385274,3,B00164KYV4,"`He's Just Not That Into You' is proof positive that it takes more than good looks and star power to make a good movie.  It takes even more than talent, which all of these actresses actually have, to make a good movie.  It takes chemistry (haven't I said this before) and it takes at least a certain level of intelligence.  `He's Just Not That Into You' lacks a lot of chemistry, which is surprising considering the cast, and it also plays things rather ignorant, which creates a very stupefied film that fails to live up to what it promised to deliver.

It's funny, because the film thinks it's really smart; but it's not.

Instead of attempting to flesh out the real drama of finding that special someone, the film pretty much throws everything at us with reckless abandonment and hopes that something, anything, is going to stick.  You have the cheating husband, the `just friends', the desperately single leech, the `living together but never getting married' and then you have the men and women who filter in and out of their lives.  Some actresses (and or actors) grab a hold of their roles better than other, but overall the experience is far too sporadic and unorganized to make any real impact.

If you are looking at this film for any other purpose other than brainless entertainment then you should look elsewhere.

I didn't expect this movie to be genius, for it is a romantic comedy, but I did expect it to have some sort of guidance.  It just seemed rather haphazard the way they just through scenario after scenario at us and then claimed to resolve it all with the wise words of a womanizer (since when is Justin Long a womanizer?).  It just makes no sense.

And yet it was still, in some ways, enjoyable.

A whose-who of talented actresses line the cast; from the ever-so-lovely Scarlett Johansson to the underrated and totally lovable Ginnifer Goodwin to Hollywood A-listers Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Aniston and even Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, not to mention Ben Affleck, Kevin Connelly and new heartthrob Bradley Cooper.  Even Kris Kristofferson shows up here!  Of the cast, Aniston and Connelly take the acting cake for me; especially Connelly who understands how to infuse the right amount of humor into her despair to make her frustrated wife believable.  I really wish that Scarlett Johansson would stop getting typecast as the flirtatious man-eater.  Yes, she is the most beautiful woman on the planet and every man wants to `get' with her, me included, but she has so much talent that it is being wasted on roles beneath her.  Goodwin, I just adore, but here she is just annoying.  I think it is more her character, but she really could have made her character at least relatable.  She's just messy here.  Barrymore is underused (she is such a luminous presence I wish she were in everything) here, and the film almost seems uninterested in her.

If you want a brainless comedy that has some laughs, some tears and some entertainment value, or if you are a die-hard fan of any of the ladies in the cast, then by all means did in; but if you want something with a little more meat then you should look elsewhere.",1254960000,,3144,4.688524590163935
3385275,3,B00164KYV4,"First the good. This movie has some interesting characters that you end up caring about by the end. It's a watchable movie that has some engaging dialog and even some lighthearted scenes. It's supposed to center around signals people give off and the difficulties in relationships. It's done in a somewhat unique way by having narration that pokes fun of dating and relationship stereotypes between scenes. The story itself revolves around an ensemble of characters, many of whom are friends, relatives or colleagues of each other. There are a number of relationship story lines, some of which end up happy and some that don't. All in all this is a fairly well-acted movie that has basically no scenes that make you cringe.

All of this being said, there were a couple of things I didn't like so much about the movie. First of all, the initial scenes were a bit confusing because the characters and their relationships were not well-introduced. It took a while to sort out who was who. Second, with such a large cast, some of the story-lines and characters seemed almost peripheral and excessive. There was a whole subplot with a sister of one of the main characters that was not very well-developed or meaningful to the main plot. As with many movies like this, you wonder if maybe a few less subplots might have allowed the remaining ones to be a little better-developed. Finally, while this is par for the course in a romantic-type movie, you could see the results of a few of the story lines coming a mile a way. Probably the most engaging relationship is the one between the girl who has most of the issues and the bartender who is supposed to be not at all interested but becomes a good friend. It's fairly obvious in their first scene that they will end up together in the end and they do.

This movie is worth checking out if you like romantic movies. You will probably end up feeling like it was very similar to other movies you've seen, but it's still quite well-done and enjoyable.",1254528000,,1992,4.640226628895184

3385277,1,B00164KYV4,"""He's Just Not That Into You"" is a sad statement about the independence and strength of the modern woman.

It's almost paradoxical that the female characters are so weak and dependent on the men because the actresses themselves are much more talented the actors are. The film featured Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connolly, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore to name a few. These characters seek to validate their self-worth through the approval of men. Sometimes the men are not so deserving, to say the least.

The point of the movie, and also the same-titled book, ought to be to empower women, to make them realize and accept that some men just aren't that into them. This doesn't mean they aren't valuable or worthy of male attention; it just means that it wasn't ""meant to be"" with a particular beau.

Several scenarios of the guy being not that into the girl included the typical: a cheating husband, a man in a long-term, committed relationship who doesn't believe in marriage and several men who just don't call.

However, all is not always as it seems on the surface. One of the above is actually into the woman he is with, but the for-once blatant advice of a girlfriend tells the woman otherwise. This straightforward advice appears to be a turning point in the movie, until another friend scolds the blunt one for, well, being so blunt. Her sudden epiphany dims as her friends suck her back into the apparent delusion which naturally accompanies feminity.

One redeeming quality of the movie is the role of Kevin Connolly as Conor. He himself is desperately in love with Anna (Scarlett Johansson), who in turn takes advantage of his affection yet refuses to commit because of her (despicable) interest in a married man. Her friend (Drew Barrymore as Mary) nudges along her affair saying, ""Oh, but what if you're soulmates?"" It is obvious throughout the movie that the relationships that ultimately work are the ones into which the couples put work. However, this nugget of wisdom is discarded for the much more audience-pleasing idea of soulmates and true love.

Speaking of work, the long-term relationships, Beth (Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck) and Janine (Connelly) and Ben (Bradley Cooper), deliver the most believably genuine emotions. But devotion will determine which one lasts and which one fails.

Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the epitome of the insecure, single woman. Her first-date nervousness and post-date phone obsession can certainly find audience sympathy. Gigi's character is endearing but also irritating in that she ignores the good advice she receives from Alex (Justin Long, the Mac guy) and continues to overanalyze the actions of every man she meets.

The relatively carefree Mary (Barrymore) and her three gay co-workers offer much-needed comic relief from the puppy dog disappointment of Gigi, the overt sexuality of Anna and the deeply painful emotions of Janine. Yet, another complaint: There were many gay supporting actors but no real homosexual relationships explored. Conor's prospective real estate buyers, a gay couple, seem to say that homosexual relationships are all about sex, completely throwing emotion out the door and perpetuating yet another stereotype.

Everyone pretty much gets a happy ending, whether that is the bliss of marriage, the fun of dating or the independence of single life. The audience, too, enjoys this typical ending, rarely considering the implied acceptance of traditional gender roles.

""He's Just Not That Into You"" perpetuates stereotypes, tells women that they're lucky when they become a man's ""exception"" and gives silent approval to the ""fact"" that most married men are only thinking about all the women they are missing out on.",1253923200,3,3712,5.130794701986755

3385282,1,B00164KYV4,"In ""He's Just Not That Into You"" you will see five women in Baltimore area - Anna (Scarlett Johansson), Beth (Jennifer Aniston), Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and Mary (Drew Barrymore) - seeking for true love in the intertwined tales of love and romance. The male stars include Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and Justin Long. The cast is impressive. Unfortunately, the characters they are playing are not.

All the characters in the film are stereotyped and underdeveloped, commonplace, almost a banality itself. What surprised me is, talented players like Drew Barrymore are so boring in most of the scenes, never being allowed to shine. Actually, most of the characters, males or females alike, come across as flat and simplistic. OK, but maybe that is the point of the film. There are lots of talks about love and relationship, but few of them are really funny or insightful. Maybe that's only me.

What really surprised me is that despite (or because of) the best efforts from the actors, some of the characters are annoying beyond belief. Take self-deluded Gigi, for example. She constantly ""misreads"" the signs of men and she is seen waiting for phone call we know she will never receive. Gigi's life consists of only one action, which is presented in an exaggerated, unfunny way, and is often painful to see. But suddenly, all her problems are solved so easily. Why don't they give her a chance, just for once, to act like a real person?

I think an ensemble story is the hardest kind of story to handle in film. Just casting Hollywood's A-list actors is not enough. Every character and his/her episodes must be equally engaging and you need special cinematic narrative skills. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is directed by Ken Kwapis who did a good job in his ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" but still he is no Robert Altman.

Where does this typecasting come from?  Because Ms. Goodwin is absolutely adorable.  She does it again here, as the adorably named and (increasingly) desperate Baltimore single Gigi who wonders why promising first dates and bar conversations never lead anywhere.  Answer:  She's obsessing WAY too much.  Gigi works in the same office with Beth (Jennifer Aniston), whose live-in boyfriend (Ben Affleck) is marriage-phobic; and Jeanine (Jennifer Connelly) an uptight control freak married to a guy (Bradley Cooper) who's had ample time to regret being pushed into marriage with her.

You are also in danger of becoming a parody of yourself.  Oh, wait--that's already happened.  Anna is friends-with-benefits with Conor (Kevin Connelly) who had one date with Gigi and is not that into her. Rounding out the cast is ad salesgirl Mary (Drew Barrymore) and wise bartender Alex (Justin Long), who counsels Gigi to behave more like a guy and not take it all so personally.  Apart from observing that Long is nowhere near as appealing here as he is as Mac in the Mac/PC commercials, he and Barrymore grated on my nerves the least.  Then, Barrymore is barely in the movie.  I think I counted three scenes that made it into the film.  The rest is all very angsty, Thirtysomethingesque, except that all of these people are too self-involved to have children.  One wonders how a nonfiction self-help book evolved into a 'romantic comedy' (in quotes, because there's not much that's either romantic or funny here) with all these different storylines.  A bit more entertaining than I was expecting it to be, which is faint praise, maybe, but that's all I got.

Theirs was the most genuine and realistic out of all the ""love"" situations. I found Goodwin's character absolutely obnoxious. Who in real life would be that insecure and needy? Any man in his right mind would run from that. Especially a womanizer who had his share of beautiful women and then he unknowingly falls for her afer she attacks him on the sofa? Gag me. As for the love triangle between Scarlett's character and two men, how cliche. Of course the femme fatalle would be played by a busty blonde. Then there is Connelly's portrayal of a pathetic wife who only snared her husband by giving him an ultimatum and then refusing to sleep with him. Upon finding out about is infidelity she accepts it quite calmly until she further discovers he is sneaking cigarettes. Sneaking sex is acceptable, but he could get lung cancer!!  Then there is Drew Barrymore's air-headed character of a modern day woman who can't figure out how to communicate with all the different technologies in today's world. I had to roll my eyes throughout much of this film as these women were a bunch of one dimensional, pathetic whiners made to look weak, needy and less than. Real women are not like this, at least the ones I know. Thank goodness.  What surprises me most is that all these A-list actors signed up for this vapid drivel in the first place. Musta have been a heck of a paycheck. I guess the moral of this film is that as a society we, as women, are programmed to believe that a man likes us if he treats us badly. Very highschool concept, most of us grow out of that. This film not recommended for intelligent women.",1249862400,19,1967,4.601139601139601

3385299,4,B00164KYV4,"As a woman in her early 40's I wasn't sure if I would be able to relate to the movie, as the characters are all many years younger than me. But I did. I really liked the beginning with the realization of how girls are truly programmed to believe that if a boy treats her badly, he 'really likes her and is just hiding it.' No wonder so many women stay in unhealthy relationships - not trying to preach but it really is a no brainer about how we brain-wash ourselves and our friends to feel better, when we really are not helping anyone at all.

The movie tackles dating and couples full force. It allows the characters to each go through different elements of the process and though it categorizes each one without a lot of room to change,(the neurotic female on the prowl, waiting for the call; the puppy dog male whose love is not recipricated but taken advantage of; the girlfriend waiting, not so patiently, for an engagement ring) change actually does occur. Each character has his/her own epiphany about relationship and his/her role in the failure or success.

This movie is a good friends movie, as you will want to talk about it during and after, to compare your own memories with what you saw on screen. I liked the ending, as there was closure. Not all is good, which I believe is more accturate than a fairy tale, happily ever after. Yet, even in the bad, there is some positive, as some characters find themselves and learn that being alone is not the same as lonely and being independent and strong is a pretty atractive in its own right.",1249603200,,1552,4.461267605633803

3385304,4,B00164KYV4,"This is an ensemble piece with three different couplings-uncouplings at its core.  The two which were quite good and enjoyable are those with Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly).  The one I didn't like or believe was Beth (Jennifer Aniston).

I don't get the popularity of Jennifer Aniston in the movies.  I find her completely unconvincing both in this movie and her other movies.  It has gotten so bad for me with her that I now skip any movie she is in.  The only thing more tiresome than her movie romances are her real world romances.  Because I like Goodwin and Connelly a lot though, I couldn't skip this movie. Aniston is why this film lost a star for me.  I found her romance with Affleck totally unbelievable and I couldn't picture these two getting married.......ever.

Otherwise, the moral of the movie is, ""If a guy says he'll call and doesn't, he's not in the hospital with a broken number-dialing finger; he's just not that into you"".  There is so much truth in this statement and also in the accompanying statement that we woman do not want to hear this truth.  We also don't want our gal pals to hear it so lie to them about how ""he must really be into her"".  Ha!

At the opposite end of the spectrum is the movie's heart, Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin).  I've been watching Goodwin on  BIG LOVE on HBO and she has been quite good in that series as a polygamous Mormon wife. Gigi is the one who wears her heart on her sleeve and usually scares the guys off.  Making things worse, her best friends, Aniston and Connelly, always convince her that the guy must really be into her and that he will call.  They should instead be telling her to wear her heart less on her sleeve and not to be so optimistic.  You worry though that if they did tell her this that she might lose a good deal of her charm and appeal. A street wise bar owner (Justin Long) sets her straight on why and when she will not hear back from certain men.

It is easy to believe that Jennifer Connelly is the one with an Oscar for her acting as she has the toughest role in the movie.  Her husband is having an affair.  Connelly provides many dimensions to being the wife in a marriage worsening scenario.  She even develops a tic, she becomes obsessed with discovering whether he is smoking on the sly.

This movie convinces you that maybe the kindest thing you can do is tell your women friends, ""he's just not that into you,"" on a regular basis so they remove the scales from their eyes and get on with the business of living their lives and maybe being able to see when ""he is that into you"" as the truth.

Nicely-done and believable performances from the whole cast, particularly Jennifer Connolly and Jennifer Aniston. Without giving too much away, I'll say that a couple of scenes with Aniston actually got me a little misty-eyed... but then again, I've been known to cry at life insurance commercials.  The thing that nearly spoiled this movie for me was the fact that the main ""playa"" guy in the movie ends up falling in love with the clueless, grasping, hopelessly romantic girl.  We all know that smooth guys never go for that girl.  The clingy girl will ALWAYS be left high and dry and wondering ""What the F just happened?"" when Mr. Wonderful turns into Mr. Emotionally Unavailable and fades away after a couple of dates, or after she sleeps with him.

3385309,4,B00164KYV4,"""He's Just Not That Into You"" uses comedy to paint a chilling commentary about contemporary relationships.  Plato said in ""The Republic,""  ""A society that chooses freedom over justice leads to chaos"" (paraphrase). In ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" Plato's prescient words come alive!  Each character is motivated by selfish motives in a real life game of ""Twister."" While, the movie has a ""happily ever after"" ending to it, it let's human nature off the hook for better ratings. Of course, no one wants to happily leave the movie feeling everyone lost, because they overreached their boundaries.  At the movie's end, society and the social environment hasn't changed, but we're left to feel good that the characters triumphed, because they all had an epiphany.

Once, I'd like to see a movie where the characters self-destruct due to greed and selfishness.  The ride home between couples would be contemplative.

All-in-All, This is a good movie for both males and females to see a ""mirror"" of ourselves.

3385310,5,B00164KYV4,"So I knew that I wanted to see this movie, but never got a chance to do so until it came out on DVD. I kind of knew what to expect, but at the same time I also didn't. After having seen it now, I'd have to say that it was a pretty good movie. I hesitate to say that it was one of the best movies I've ever seen because it didn't quite have that quality that I look for when I think of a movie as truly great. It was most definitely a lot different than some of those typical, run-of-the-mill romantic comedies. This was in my opinion one of the better if not the best romantic comedies that I've ever seen, and that's saying something. I'm not saying that I've seen every single Rom-Com out there, but I've seen my fair share of them. The movie called Definitely Maybe is pretty much the only other one that I consider to be a really good Rom-Com. Well, maybe not but it's the first one that comes to mind. I like it when a movie's plot isn't super complicated and you're trying to figure out what on earth is going on while still paying attention to the movie. This movie was very easy to follow. At first, I was going to say that one of the relationships that takes place in the movie seemed a bit much or something like that, but as I continued to write my review, I realized that it kind of drove the point home a little more by having that relationship there in the movie. Basically, if you're in the mood for an entertaining movie that is less likely to make you feel like checking your watch or a clock halfway through, then this might be a good option for you to choose.",1247875200,,1578,4.110032362459547

""He Is Just Not That Into You"" is a more realistic romantic comedy - not every character gets a happy Hollywood ending, but they all grow in the span of their relationships. The movie is a lot more hopeful than the book it was loosely adapted from.

The cast is superb, particularly Ginnifer Goodwin as a girl who just can't seem to find love, but is desperately looking for it with every guy she meets.

The opening sequence of the movie is worth the price of the film alone - it speaks to the core of what causes the misunderstandings and misgivings that girls have about relationships.",1247356800,,768,4.356643356643357

3385325,4,B00164KYV4,"Dating is, perhaps, the oldest game there is.  We all play it at some point, devoting countless hours and resources to it, only to fail a majority of the time.  We enlist the help of others--friends, books, websites, seminars, etc.--but even with such help we still end up utterly lost.  There doesn't seem to be a fixed set of rules, and when we think we've found a set, countless exceptions pop up and throw said ""rules"" out the window.  Aiding and abetting our frustrated attempts are well-meaning friends who encourage us through assurances of our likeability, our attractiveness, the other person's stupidity, etc.  So why do we continue to play this game?  We play in hopes of finding that ever-elusive thing called love.

It is into this eternal fracas that the filmmakers of He's Just Not That Into You cast their audience.  This is the story of nine intertwining lives, each person's tale adding another layer to the complexity of relationships that we all encounter day to day.  This film boasts an all-star cast and, for the most part, does not disappoint.  It is charming, funny, dramatic, shocking, and incredibly honest.  A rare find in a ""romantic comedy"" genre so often riddled with puerile vapidity.

Though a story of nine lives, the central story guiding the film is that of Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), a hopeless romantic who spends much of her time pining by a phone hoping her latest date will call.  As tends to happen in such circumstances, Gigi is patronized and coddled by her girlfriends who attempt to assuage her fears of being rejected and alone.  Then Gigi meets Alex (Justin Long), a straight-shooting bar manager who opens Gigi's eyes to the difference between what men tell her and what they really mean.  This includes the shocking reality that sometimes guys just aren't into the girls they go on dates with.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with this as everyone can't be ""the One,"" it's just a fact that needs to be accepted and dealt with.

The rest of the film deals primarily with stereotypes:  the obsessive compulsive wife, the pompous jackass who finds it hard to believe that marriage means he can only sleep with one person for the rest of his life, the sultry libertine who lures him away, the guy who ""doesn't believe in marriage,"" the woman who's been with him for nearly a decade hoping he'll change his mind, and of course those who are looking for love in all the wrong places/faces/online profiles.  But even though these characters are stereotypes, they are believable and done very well.  All of us know people exactly like the ones portrayed on screen and so we are able to connect with, and probably even empathize, with what is transpiring before our eyes.

All in all, this film is quite enjoyable and I appreciate the honest way in which relationships are portrayed by the filmmakers.  It's refreshing to see a ""chick flick"" which actually has some basis in reality and does not fit the typical ""girl meets guy, they fall in love, fight and break up, get back together, and live happily ever after"" formula that typifies the genre.  Inevitably, some will not like what they see on screen and will claim it's too harsh on certain types of people.  My only response to that would be:  the truth sometimes hurts.

Video/Audio
The Blu-ray disc is presented in full 1080p in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is excellent and really brings out the vibrant colors used throughout the film.  The audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is very crisp.  This is mostly a talking movie, so it's hard to really evaluate the sound, but I had absolutely no complaints about the quality.

Special Features
There are a number of special features included on the Blu-ray disc.  These include deleted scenes with commentary by the director, a featurette on translating the book into the film, and an interesting look into how film directors stage such seemingly extemporaneous scenes as phone calls.  The most interesting special feature for me personally are six mini-interviews with the characters of the film showing how their lives have changed since the conclusion of the film.  Very interesting way to continue the story and brings a further sense of realness to the lives of the characters.",1247097600,,4231,4.8238557558945905
3385326,4,B00164KYV4,"I was not into seeing this film, but I watched it for free. This movie was not the romantic comedy I was expecting. It was extremely blunt about the problems and expectations men and, especially, women have when it comes to dating. Blunt to the point where you cringe for the characters, but the information for these people is necessary. It is the only way they can grow and gain the ability to be in a real relationship. That being said it did have some truly funny parts that blended into the movie perfectly.

The actors were all great, none more so than Ginnifer Goodwin. She is a lovable gal, who unfortunately lives in the dark when it comes to guys. And shock of all shocks, my favorite guy in this movie is Ben Affleck. (I despise this man as an actor, so for me this is huge.)

The only problem is I feel like the movie almost excuses certain characters for unacceptable behavior. (Minor SPOILER) The cheaters seem let off the hook instead of reprimanded. I don't care what society we live in or what year it is, cheating is always wrong!

I became a semi fan of Greg Bernhardt (?) even watched his short lived talk show.  The characters in this movie was dead on.  They were interesting, and the movie was engaging not boring.  My best couples was Gigi and Alex, but also Jennifer Anniston's character and Ben Affleck.  Marriage is an important part of most women's lives.  I never could quite understand why some guys can be content of going on for years and years without commiting to marriage.  What's the difference?  I think this movie kind of answered it for me.  When being pressured and pushed, guys will run....but as soon as they are able to relax about it; and get no resistance from their partner, all of a sudden marriage isn't such a bad thing.  Loved this movie...it was lighthearted and made me smile and felt good at the end.

OK. I loved this movie.

I almost cheered when Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) and Justin Long (Alex) got together. It was sooo cute.

Scarlett Johansson, who I always thought was pretty is positively thick for this movie. Really smokin' hot. She's a great actress, too. I've always liked Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston and they didn't disappoint. I didn't care for Jennifer Connelly's character and felt like stomping on her foot by the end of the movie, but they can't all be winners, can they? I like Drew Barrymore too and her character was cute in a Drew Barrymore way, but she was swallowed up by the other sizable actors around her in her seemingly small role. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where Drew Barrymore was dwarfed before. Even in ""Donnie Darko"", her supporting role spotlighted her between the Gyllenhals. Kris Kristofferson as Jennifer Aniston's dad and Luis Guzman as a typecast Mexican worker role: two great actors which were sadly almost were non-existent in this movie...disappointing. I was just waiting to see what happened with Long and Goodwin! Really.

'He Doesn't Like You All Too Much' is the story of four or five couples/relationships that are as close to a tragic bus accident as one could get.

1.  You have your clingy, overbearing, highly annoying girl who talks a lot and can't understand why nobody wants to call her or ask her out for a second date.  It's possible that it's because she's annoying and talks an awful lot, I don't know.

2.  You have the college sweethearts who married, but don't really know why they're married...and it takes a flaky blonde (Johansson) winning a cooler that holds a sixer of Schlitz tallboys at a convenient store to make the husband realize this.  ""This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me!""  proclaims Scarlet as she holds up the camping item worth about $3.50.

3.  The couple where the guy doesn't believe in marriage, but the woman wants to.

4.  A real estate agent who is horribly miscast (women don't like guys who are 4'11"", I'm sorry).  He is trying to nail a couple of the cast members.

5.  Uh...what am I missing, here?  Oh, there's Drew Barrymore who really has no business being in this movie.  Her character is a complete afterthought and it's almost as if the production went on and then 3/4 of the way through shooting the thing the Assistant Director had to remind everyone, ""Hey, we've had Drew Barrymore over there in her trailer for the first 45 days of the shoot...do you want to use her at all? ""

It's just two hours of people whining about relationships and I suppose it's all supposed to be poignant, but it's nothing you haven't seen on 'The Young & The Restless'.

This movie is just an elongated soap opera, really.

There are four separate storylines to track, and they're all tethered to Gigi, an emotionally insecure twenty-something who takes her shallow bar conversations with men so seriously that she constantly waits for them to follow up. She had high hopes for Conor, a real estate agent who never calls her back, but she then finds an unexpected dating coach in his best friend Alex, a promiscuous bar owner who cynically teaches her how to read the signs of non-interest.

Meanwhile, Janine, one of Gigi's co-workers, feels something is going awry in her marriage to Ben as she busies herself renovating their home. He accidentally meets comely yoga instructor and aspiring singer Anna at the local supermarket, and they embark on a clandestine affair against their better judgment. Gigi's other co-worker Beth has been living monogamously with Neil, a photographer, for seven years, and marriage doesn't appear in the cards. They break up due to his lack of desire to get married, but a near-tragedy at Beth's younger sister's wedding makes them reconsider their relationship. Providing a full circle to the film's structure, the fourth plot has Anna rebuffing the serious overtures of an enamored Conor as she considers her situation with Ben, while her friend Mary, a newspaper editor who faces a similar predicament as Gigi, finds a connection with Conor when he starts advertising his business in her paper.

It's really the pat treatment of the intertwining characters that trivializes the movie into something just a little deeper than a TV commercial. Had there been more focus on one of the stories, say Gigi and Alex's, with the rest relegated to minor subplots, then the movie could have possibly resonated more. The cast is certainly attractive enough, but I wouldn't say they are ideally compatible as an ensemble. Ginnifer Goodwin (the youngest wife on HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Love/dp/B0011UMC72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Love</a>) has to play up Gigi's eager nervousness at such an excitable level that her neediness starts to feel too one-note. As lothario-in-love Alex, Justin Long (yes, the Apple guy) seems miscast in a swinger role that would have been a better fit for Bradley Cooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>), who plays Ben. Even more, the friends-to-lovers relationship between him and Goodwin never feels quite authentic enough to sustain the story arc it needs to support. Initially, it was nice to see Jennifer Connelly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind/dp/B000FVQLQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind</a>) in a lighter role than her usual sturm und drang, but as Janine recognizes her husband's adultery, she bears the burden of the film's most dramatic episode.

As Ben, Cooper is merely called upon to look guilty for most of his screen time, that is, when he is not being seduced by the sultry charms of Scarlett Johansson as Anna. After her work for Woody Allen, she seems particularly on automatic pilot here and not very challenged by the role. Kevin Connolly (HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Entourage/dp/B001AQO3V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Entourage</a>) plays Conor in a way that forces him to waver between boyish and selfish. Perhaps due to their tabloid overexposure, Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck at first don't seem to mesh well with the others, but as the story progresses, both turn in surprisingly sympathetic work as Beth and Neil. Rounding out the cast is executive producer Drew Barrymore, who plays Mary as a comic wallflower confused by the complicated impact of communications technology on dating. The 2009 DVD is fairly bare-bones containing both the widescreen and full-screen versions of the film. There is a handful of deleted scenes with optional commentary from Kwapis, although it seems like a surprising omission not to have his insights included on an optional commentary track for the film itself.",1245628800,2,5083,6.047156726768377
3385349,4,B00164KYV4,"First I heard that so many great actors and actresses in this movie, I felt like whaoow.. it must have been a great script that all of them join the team to make this movie. But sometimes they're kinda tricky, many great actor and a good director but suddenly it's way overrated (which I don't understand how come they waste all that talents) but not in this one. People kinda harsh to this movie, I guess that they expect a simple feel good chick flick, or romantic comedy, as usual. This one is more of a serious romantic drama with a little bit humor like in real life, so I found it amazing. Real life opinion (not the ones they put on purpose between each written explanation, ex : ""if he never calls you"" then some guy or girl talks.. no .. not that one), the story itself is telling us about relationship, how to find and maintain one, in a great storytelling style, it's kinda slow at the beginning but it's all worthied to be watched and learned from. Some little real life comedy here and there, but overall it's a great drama about realtionships. All the actors, actresses and the director are doing a great job.

If you are trying to find or in a relationship, this movie is totally worthwatching. Trust me. If you are a chick flick regular, probably you won;t find this one as fun as other chick flick or romantic comedy (because  this is more of a drama). I like it a lot. Thanks",1245542400,18,1393,4.3538461538461535
3385350,1,B00164KYV4,"I am going to do my best to write a proper review for this flick BECAUSE I HATE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. And I want to share that hate with you.

We open with giant bubble of perkiness Gennifer Goodwin as Gigi as a child, with her older self giving a voice-over. She is a young girl on a playground, and a boy comes over to her and shoves her to the ground. She runs crying to her mother, and her mother says the boy did it because he likes her. Gigi then speculates that this is what screws with so many women's heads and messes with them later in life, because they come to associate bad behavior by men with affection. We then join Gigi as an adult at the end of a date with Conor, this totally bland yuppie. He says he'll give her a call and she gets excited when she sees him taking his cell phone out, but he calls Scarlett Johansson as Anna. She tells him she doesn't want to get together just then, and gets ridiculously excited over this cooler she won [it's depressing to see Scarlett Johansson have to act so stupid], and flirts with the guy behind her in line, Ben. He's a music producer and she's an aspiring singer, but he tells her he can't hear from her, because he's married... to Jennifer Connelly as Janine, who works in the same office as Gigi and Jennifer Aniston as Betsy, at some magazine [this is the Cosmopolitan magazine version of life, in which everyone works at a magazine or is a yoga instructor or a music producer]. Betsy has been living with Ben Affleck as Neil for seven years, but he doesn't want to get married because he doesn't believe in marriage. Which, in this movie, is less preferable to being a Satanist, say, or a leper. Oh, and by the way, all of this is supposedly happening in Baltimore. Have you ever BEEN to Baltimore?

So Gigi starts obsessing over Conor calling, although we have no evidence that they had any particular chemistry or connection. She waits for him to call, staring at her phone at work! In the shower! At her yoga class! Janine advises her on when to call and for how long. Soon she's planning on just ""stopping by"" a place he said he sometimes frequents in order to engineer a run-in with him. The majority of the first half-hour here is made up of Gigi growing more obsessive about whether Conor, who you will recall she met once, will call, with her entire sense of self-worth apparently hanging in the balance. It gets to the point where she really does seem to be the badly-damaged shell of what once was a human being. She does go to the restaurant he said he frequents, where she ends up meeting his friend, Alex, played by Justin Long, who apparently runs the place. He came out to help at the bar, as they were super busy, but apparently has time to just sit around and talk to Gigi all night. He tells her flat-out that Conor will never call, because--can you guess?--He's Just Not That Into Her. Alex will be the one to deliver the major bullet points of the self-help book this is adapted from for the remainder of the movie. He also tells her that too many women hear what amounts to urban legends about women who didn't give up on a guy, and finally he relented and they got married. He says too many women think that they'll be ""the exception"" when in fact they are ""the rule."" Gigi seems over Conor the next day at work--where apparently their jobs consist of sitting around and obsessing over relationships.

SPOILERS > > > Meanwhile, Ben has decided that there's no harm in flirting with Anna, and calls her. This involves him smoking cigarettes on the sly, which he tries, through several scenes and numerous lies, to keep from his wife, Janine. The issue slowly starts to gnaw at her sanity, as she knows something is wrong, but Ben won't admit it. There is a bizarre scene in which she accuses Luis Guzman's contractors of smoking while they work on renovating their house. Once it's revealed that Ben actually is smoking, she says ""What part of `my father died of lung cancer' is so hard for you to understand?"" as though her personal trauma gives her license to completely control his life. Eventually he comes clean that he had an affair, expecting her to simply dump him, then surprised that she wants to talk about it and work it out. Janine blames herself. It must be said that this is the only thread of the movie that feel in any way genuine, as Jennifer Connelly is able to bring some real, grounded emotion to it.

Meanwhile Betsy grows more and more upset that Neil won't marry her, despite his repeated assurances that he loves her, and doesn't believe in marriage on ideological grounds. Idi-a-whatdicalogical grounds? Janine says. When Alex gives Gigi the advice that if a guy hasn't married you after two years, he isn't going to marry you, Betsy goes home and tells Neil that ""she needs him to not be nice to her if he isn't going to marry her."" This is the sort of ""kooky"" statement that some women apparently think is adorable [this movie made me really glad not to be straight]. Anyway, despite the fact that their relationship is going swimmingly, Betsy ""Can't do this"" and breaks up with Neil for not marrying her. In here we briefly see Drew Barrymore in a tiny part that has no relation to anything. Nevertheless, Drew produced the film, so special scorn must be heaped on her.

So some of the corollary advice to ""if a man hasn't married you... he's not going to marry you"" that Alex gives Gigi is that ""If a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."" This casts the whole situation as that all women are desperate for men to call, and are delighted to hear from and date any man, while men are completely in control of the situation, and can choose to call the woman back or not, as they like. If they want to see a woman, the woman WILL see them. I'm sure several men out there would be quite surprised to find out that this is the case. Anyway, Gigi shows that she has actually not grown beyond her desperate yearning for a boyfriend above all else, only altered the context of her delusions, as she starts to believe that Alex is secretly in love with her, and has been telling her this in code all along. She accepts his invitation to a party as the fruition of their secret passion, and finally makes an ill-advised move on him.

He tells her that no, he is actually not secretly in love with her, causing her to deliver a withering character assessment about how he just uses people and never really connects to anyone, concluding ""You have not won. You're alone, Alex."" We'll leave until later discussion of WHAT Gigi could possibly mean by classifying the entire issue into ""winning"" and ""losing,"" with finding companionship [regardless of with who?] definitively posed as ""winning.""

Okay, time to arbitrarily stop the movie and wrap everything up! Time's up, folks! Betsy and Neil get back together! And guess what? He proposes in a cute, TV-movie way, and they get married! Mary [that's Drew] and Conor get together! Anna has a singing gig [i.e. she hasn't found a relationship, but she's on her way to pursuing her dream]! Janine and Ben, surprise, break up, and she moves out! And Gigi's harsh character assessment was exactly what Alex needed to realize that goll-darn it, she's right! And in fact, she is the very woman he must spend the rest of his life with! They've WON. < < < SPOILERS END

The primary emotion this movie evokes is sadness for people who view relationships this way, and the people who will watch this movie and feel that they must adopt to these standards in order to find a relationship, and hence to ""win."" Gigi is a character clearly in need of several years of reparative therapy for her wildly distorted view of her own value and human relationships, yet the movie tries to coast on a ""We're all like this, deep inside!"" vibe. The pathetic obsession she develops over whether Conor will call her is embarrassing and sad, not adorable. Her lack of insight developed through the film--she simply switches fantasy-based obsession with Conor for fantasy-based obsession with Alex--is also disheartening. Yet the film has no criticism of her, it holds her up as a model for the winning strategy of being sincere and open to people, which apparently trumps all other characteristics--like, say, wisdom or intelligence. By the time she indicates that for her, being partnered is ""winning"" and being alone ""losing,"" one pities her distorted view of relationships, but the point of the view of the movie is that this is pretty much the way things are.

Betsy is blind to the attributes of her relationship, and only the public validation of a wedding can make it real to her. At which point she can begin looking forward to the next milestone, having a baby [as Janine wishes to do], with an option to also achieve wonderful completions of self such as renovating one's fabulous loft! Really, you should receive two free issues of Cosmopolitan with your ticket purchase, which will convert to a full subscription unless you cancel.

The movie really is disconcerting and uncomfortable in the way that it suggests that all women are wholly mentally preoccupied with guys, whether a guy will call, whether they'll have a relationship [they'll WIN!], and then get married, then renovate the loft, then have a baby! After that, I suppose life ends? Or I think perhaps you flip into being the bitter wife whose husband likes younger women but its okay because you have the credit card to acquire shoes and redo the house again? While watching the movie I kept wondering at the mindset--and set-up for disappointment--that people who share this film's worldview must have. I mean, WHAT is going to happen after you've finally scored that relationship? After you've ""won?"" And most of all, after one has married, that ultimate milestone and validation of all that is you! Most films end with marriage and don't bother to show what comes after, but this one really egregiously sets that up as the ultimate prize, to the point where one begins to worry about the people that might be taken in by this viewpoint. We all know that one person who just keeps talking about having a relationship, and their new strategy for getting a relationship, and how their main focus is on finding a relationship, and after a while you want to say ""Um, what do you think is going to HAPPEN when you find this mythical relationship? You're going to be delivered into some blissful state of endless nirvana and never have any other concerns or problems again?"" Because like those people, this movie just kind of makes you WORRY for those people that have this distorted viewpoint, and wish that somehow they could just undergo a complete, ground-up change of mind.

Let's again underscore this film's view of women as vacuous bundles of emotional need who seem unable or unwilling to process anything that doesn't have to do with DATING! And superficial symbols of personal validation such as someone thinking one is cute or calling one back. The irony is that this is positioning itself so heavily as a ""chick flick,"" and to be supportive of women, when in fact it is painting them as neurotic and shallow strivers with significantly warped self-images, lacking any secure sense of self [except that which they think they should SEEM to have in order to be more DATABLE!] and desperate for the validation of any fleeting attention from even the most unsuitable of men. It's just sad, more than anything! Talk about the five-hankie weeper of the year. OH, and by the way, this is apparently supposed to be a ""comedy.""

Really, I don't understand why feminists weren't burning theaters down when this was out.

The ultimate betrayal this movie is guilty of is devoting two hours to trying to strip women of their delusions about romance and get them to accept that the ""fairy tale"" ending they yearn for is not a reality--then end is such a way that nearly all the characters achieve that magical, surprise fairy tale ending! And like in the fairy tale, it leaves the women in the audience, the ones in supposedly supports, with the old ""they lived happily ever after"" and doesn't bother to include what might happen as these people continue to live their lives. But whatever, they've ""WON!""

This is one of those things where one feels that the director, Ken Kwapis, and the screenwriters, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, really need to be exiled to a desert island, where they can inflict no more damage on society. You will need chemical decontamination after this film and women, please do not let your daughters watch this damaging film.

The language (the F word is used more than once along with other ""colorful metaphors""), the fairly graphic office sex scene with two of the characters, the one character saying how she'd like to ""dry hump"" one of the male characters, partial nudity, etc., make this movie totally inappropriate for anyone under 17 and should have been rated R.

You will probably have to decide that for yourself, but I found it watchable--I must have, because I saw it twice at the theatre, and I bought the DVD!--but then, that's me.  If I don't expect too much from a film, and if there is a cast of exceptional actors, then I will probably really enjoy it.

Some of the reviews of this movie complained about the huge cast, but to me, it was kind of like a slice of real life--albeit singles life in the New Millennium--with a group of interconnected characters.  It was more than a series of vignettes, like you might have found in the old Robert Altman films, since the characters were all connected in some way (via a kind of six-degrees-of-separation fashion); furthermore, the same characters kept popping up often enough that you could actually follow their adventures, as they attempt to figure out the ""rules"" for singles life.

Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Ben Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore are some of the major stars you'll find here.  They are fun to watch and bring out some interesting points about how men and women view relationships in very different ways.  Nothing new there!

For these reasons, I decided to grant five stars to this flick.

Laurel-Rain Snow",1245283200,3,1558,5.485355648535565
3385364,5,B00164KYV4,"I love this film.  I saw it first as a rental and immediately purchased it.  I have viewed it an additional 3 times since.  Peope try to label this film but that is something you can't do.  It is a film that while following the lives of many people educates the viewer on why guys do what they do when dating.  Many say this is definitely not a date movie.  I totally disagree.  Unless you have tried some of the antics in the film on the date you are with you will share many laughs at what people go through when dating.

The first thing I did find I had to adjust to was not only all the characters lives intersecting in some way but also the fact that every character was a big name star.  After getting over that and then seeing the characters for who they were it was smooth sailing.  I thought the film did an amazing job of making six separate storylines intertwine and be believable, not forced or over the top.  The main story that all flows from is the storyline between Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long.  They both shine and keep the film anchored.  I also found the storyline between Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck very touching.  It was a very real situation that many couples face.  Jennifer Aniston brought an amazing depth to her role and made me scream for her to finally get the ideal role that would show all her potential.

Viewers will have their favorite storylines and favorite characters based on which stars they like and also which situations they may have faced in their own lives.  I thought each actor was given great moments to shine both dramatically and comicly.  Jennifer Connelly is a hoot with her obsession over cigarettes and Drew Barrymore is charming.  Bottom line for me, this film is a very witty intelligent story that educates on dating in the current age.  The writing and direction is superb and provides the actors firm ground to soar.  This movie made me laugh.  This movie made me tear up as well and I am a 46 year old guy.  Could this be a date movie?  You bet.

And the blu ray version is a feast for the eyes.  The 1080p high def picture is so crystal clear and vibrant.  Colors are crisp and flesh tones perfection.  There is no grain and the picture is just as detailed in the day and night scenes.  As for the audio, this is a dialogue driven film and the audio presentation works perfectly.

This movie is a treat.  It is so nice to see an intelligent comedy for a change and you will love seeing your favorite stars have a ball with the script.  You will also discover some new favorite stars.  For me I had no idea who Bradley Cooper was.  I was thinking this guy was great with nice comedic timing and then he is suddenly out there with THE HANGOVER and becoming a true star.  He does great work here too.

I highly recommend this film.  If you are a player then you engage in these realistic antics and the film will bug you.  But for everyone else it is a feel good film that will touch your heart.",1245283200,2,2962,4.318181818181818
3385365,4,B00164KYV4,"Yes, Hollywood can still make successful character driven films with smart dialog. No Animation, no special effects, no explosions, just a good story told well.

""He's Just Not That Into You"", written by Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein based on the book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo hit theatres on February 6th, 2009, and was the surprise of the Post Oscars/Pre-Summer Junk Dump Season.  Since you may have missed it as few venture out into that barren cinematic wasteland that is February, now is the time to catch this fun flick as New Line Home Video sends it to the shelves on Tuesday June 2nd, 2009.

This one hundred and twenty-nine minute romp includes a talented ensemble cast including: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Scarlett, Johansson, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Justin Long.  Though slightly skewed too far to one side, ""He's Just Not That Into You"", takes an in depth look into relationships and respective success and failure.  We want different things, with different people, and no one knows what the other is thinking.  Should relationships be this hard?  Should watching others struggle through them be this enjoyable?  It is simply because, though we may not relate to all these people, we do relate to the situations.  That is a reflection of good writing, and one might have to go back as far as ""The Big Chill"" to find people we enjoy this much who are talking about things we care about.

From a young woman out to find love being mentored by the all knowing bar manager, to the puppy dog clinging to the hottie who really wants the married guy who thinks he may have made a mistake, to the guy who just doesn't want to get married to the woman he loves, to the women in relationships they just can't figure out due to a myriad of reasons including the growing relationship reliance on technology, this film has it all.  Someone should write a book.  Oh, wait, they did.  Inspired by an episode and based on a book written by two writers of ""Sex in the City"", this film reaches levels of enjoyment that Carrie and her clan only wish they could bring to the big screen.

Yes, not all the performances are on the same level.  Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly give performances that are limited in dimension through most of the film, and the transition made by Justin long as he goes from the cool dating mentor, to frantic heart sick puppy may be beyond his young capabilities, but the majority of the cast give fine performances in what are all essentially supporting roles.  In most cases we end up wanting more of the people we saw the least of, and less of those we saw the majority of.

Though there is little offered as Special features in this new release; the additional scenes are surprisingly enlightening and entertaining.  In most cases we can usually see why scenes are indeed left out of a film, and with ""He's Just Not That Into You"" boasting a running time of over two hours, an argument can certainly be made for the cuts made, but the insights on parental influence found in these scenes were entertaining and well acted. Adding commentary by Director Ken Kwapis, who did a fine job of utilizing his stacked cast within a well paced tale, makes sitting through the extra scenes again well worth the investment.

Recommendation: This is a great film to watch with friends and a surprisingly pleasant addition to any collection. The story and the dialog are the stars here, and well worth your time.",1245283200,,3493,4.69672131147541

A couple of years ago, I bought Greg Behrendt's book (""He's Just Not That into You"") and absolutely LOVED it!  It offered good advice and was funny as well.

Unfortunately, none of that transferred to the big screen. Everybody got the story line; so, it became boring watching so many of the same examples of women simply not understanding when a man is just not that into them.  When a person doesn't (1) call, (2) return calls, (3) act interested, 4) make time to see you, etc., it's because he/she is not interested.  Period.

I could not believe how virtually all the women were portrayed as gullible, stupid, pathetically yearning for a guy, and, in Jennifer Connelly's case, irritatingly whiny and nagging.

3385372,4,B00164KYV4,"Several reviewers have identified this film as being for the dating and coupling scene of youth.  I disagree.  We have many older folks out in the dating arena, these days, going through some of the same angst of the younger generations.  Will they call?  Do they care?  Are they married and hiding it?  And, for many older women who have become accomplished, they have to wonder; are they after me, or my hard-earned, success.  So searching for Mr. Right, over the course of our lifespans, doesn't change that much; in fact, it can get more complicated. So, in essence, this movie can provide some thoughts to ponder across the age spectrum. A very good thing, since even seniors, can turn into gushy teens, again, when shot by Cupid's arrow.

(SPOILER) Some felt that the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jeniffer Aniston's characters was a tad unbelievable; that they would live together for 7 years without marriage and that ultimately Ben's character would cave. I disagree, again; their relationship rang the truest. They had a very loving, faithful relationship, that had endured time.  When Aniston's character removed the obstacle of marriage, Ben's character no longer felt he was being forced into conformity.  It was then HIS decision; one conceived in freedom-of-choice. This was textbook Psych 101, 'you can take the horse to water, but can't make him drink,' until he darn well pleases.

The idea of 'marriage' was the area I found unsettling, because how many of us ladies were the one to drop the, less than subliminal, idea of 'marriage' first?  If so, it makes you wonder if your partner really wanted the same thing, or if they just 'settled.'  This was very well, and sadly, depicted in the Connelly relationship.  And, for many who did push the commitment proposal, first, I suspect it will have them staring into their partner's eyeballs with some jaded contempt, wondering why they didn't have the storybook proposal, while strongly empathizing with Connelly.

The cast was stellar, with a few reservations. Drew Barrymore's character was irresistibly charming, as always. Johannsen's husband-stealing seduction was very well played out, and, is guaranteed to make you bring out the cat-claws.  You've seen the type too many times before, but then, she wasn't the problem, just a symptom of a much deeper one, which is generally the case.  The character I found most annoying was J. Goodwin. Yeah, she was cute, but too ditsy and trying too darn hard to connect with Mr. Right. Her behaviors were the most immature of the bunch, but we've all known friends like her; ones that we are always telling 'you can't find anyone if you're trying too hard---it will happen when you least expect it.' This philosophy even rang true for her.

I thought this film could have been better developed, and the messages deepened. It had a 'flaky' factor I did not embrace.  I'd rate it a B+ accomplishment. However, I will still recommend it to all my friends that remain on the prowl; even for those that believe they've found their soul-mate, because it reminds us that things aren't always as they appear; that denial can exist in what is believed to be the perfect union, leading to lost years and promises---and life is too darn short.

Have a girl's night, watch it, and cherry-pick the scenes of wisdom, and/or the behaviors that apply to you.  I can almost guarantee that you'll find some.",1244332800,24,3409,4.8939130434782605

I think this is probably more of a chick flick because let's face it - we have more than likely all been there a time or two!  I believe that women are more willing to share with others about the highs and lows of dating and marriage.  I think this movie is WAY better than people have been rating it and I hope to add it my ""own"" list of dvd's.
I loved that some of the actors and actresses were not A-listers - it somehow made it more real.  I felt like I could relate with Gigi - the girl who is always hoping but also see myself in some of the other women.

What happened to the telephone when people actually spoke to each other, heard their voices and inflections on the other end of the line. Oh the instant gratification of it all. I see a whole generation of people that don't know how to communicate with each other. Does anyone remember when Carrie Bradshaw got dumped by a post it note......coward. So all this technology may be great ( IM, Texting, e-mail Facebook, my space ...)there is nothing like actual person to person talking which without leads to  non communication and confusion. I love all the cast of characters in this film, especialy Jennifer Goodwin...very good job, trying to find her way around the dating and double talk maze...Drew Barrymore always good ( exhaustingly states she got dumped by 7 different technologies in one day ) Jennifer Aniston plays a character that stands her ground, and Jennifer Connally does and an amazing job of a scorned wife, you could visually see her pain. There were a few good endings and surprises and a very enjoyable movie....Microwave some popcorn and see it with your friends and enjoy the converstion after the movie.",1244246400,8,1172,4.830845771144278

This movie had everything going for it- big budget, glossy cast, and a great idea. But it was executed extremely poorly and ended up being a lie. This is supposed to be about the reality and the harshness of relationships, and it isn't. It's just another romantic comedy that doesn't seem to have any underlying message to the audience.

The first time I thought it was going to be a hilarious laugh out loud comedy which gave me a wrong impression of what the movie was really like.  There are funny parts, but there is also plenty of real modern romantic reality- drama.

This movie has great cast including Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston, and Ben Affleck, and a great plot that make this a romantic film to be seen by both women and men. This movie is about modern day relationships which include endless use of modern technology, clueless men and clingy women. Not only is this film enjoyable, but there is alot to be learned about the dos and donts in love and relationships. This film has it all!

3385381,1,B00164KYV4,"This movie has a great cast BUT that is all that is great about it. Let me just say I'm so glad I rented this movie before buying it because it was super boring. The movie goes back and forth between a bunch of different couples and single people and their problems and mishaps but it seems more like a horrible documentary to me. Througout each ""stage"" you have words that pop up on the screen and then you have random people talk about their real relationship like a documentary. The movie was NOT funny at all and it was really really boring. It switched between people way too quickly and it was just a bunch of people throwing themselves at each other. You had a crazy woman that threw herself at every guy she seen, you had the husband that was cheating on his wife with another woman that was in her own relationship, you had the woman who broke up with her boyfriend because he wouldn't marry her after 7 years, etc. I wanted to turn it off within the first 30 mins BUT I sat it through and I really wish I wouldn't of.

This movie does show what people go through in relationships but who wants to watch a ""documentary"" on every one else's relationship? If you have been in a relationship or you are in one now you have already ""seen"" this movie so to speak.

Again this movie had an amazing cast BUT that is the end of it. There was nothing else great about this movie. I was really expecting a lot more out of it and I was TRULY disappointed. Do not waste you money on this movie. It will put you to sleep.",1243987200,2,1517,4.191780821917808

Was surprised to find a  smart, sharp, beautifully performed, realistic yet entertaining composite portrait of what we all go through.  Five Star film.  Acting shout-outs in particular to the JenBen couple and Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long.  Jennifer Connelly, even in a film that may not perhaps be Oscar material, shows us that no matter what she does, she herself is Oscar material every moment she inhabits a frame. I felt her pain, especially (spoiler hint alert) how she focused on the ciggies.  Been there.  We really do that.  The writing and situations are so realistic we have all been there.  Should be required viewing for every adult.  Highly recommended.  One sorry note:  The DVD itself, which was just released today, has almost nothing in the way of extras with the exception of a few deleted scenes.",1243900800,7,1021,4.7542857142857144

3385397,2,B00164KYV4,"This is the part (once I really get into the meat of the review) where the desperate to wed or clingy, why isn't he calling me types are going to string me up by my over 30 and beat the bs statistic married shoestrings. First of all the actors/actresses they picked for this movie were fantastic, and the title literally explains a perfectly logical point that He (or even she) Is Not That Into You. When I caught it on Sex & he City, it was genius. Of course! It makes sense....we all have had people in our lives that we liked, but didn't have that kind of chemistry with. They usually fell into friend zone. I think society puts too much emphasis that people of the opposite sex can not be friends and can only date. What's wrong with just hanging out and getting to know someone? Given my experience, I think we should be friends first and foremost. At least than either something blossoms from it or doesn't, but can if it's going to happen without the ridiculous presser people put on themselves to be with someone (anyone). And this movie certainly sells the same heaping spoonful that everyone has to have someone, even if they settle. I'll give a brief bio of the characters as part of my review as the movie itself is hard to describe otherwise.

Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) who we know from Big Love, is a delightful person you just want to layer in bubble wrap in hopes to keep her hopeless puppy heart from being broken. She clings to the phone in dire almost painful neediness, and eventually grows frustrated with the language and games people play.

Scarlett Johansson....oh the lovely married to Ryan Reynolds in real life Scarlett...her character Anna is one we all want to hate. I myself wanted to run into this character in real life and slap her in her pretty face, tether her to my rear bumper by her lengthy blond locks, and drag her a few miles across uneven terrain. Without ruining it for you, in case you are going to watch this regardless of the reviews, I'll just say this....she's a beautiful manipulative, pouty siren who, in her own twisted logic way, is looking for love in all the completely wrong places.

Drew Barrymore plays a wonderful little part; always quirky and with a little comic relief. But you only get bits and pieces of her. Eventually, in a round about way, she gets what she's looking for and we're happy for her.

Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck play a couple that have been together for years (over 5), living together in a great apartment, building a life until one day Beth (Anniston) has gotten it in her head that they need to be married. I'll tell you right now the long, pointless dance they play out was utterly predicable. I annoyed my girl friend sitting next to me (as I wasn't going to drag my fianc at the time to this piece of chickflick), bursting out with each accurate prediction. Tiring drama.

Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper play another couple whom have been married for a little while, having undertaken the arduous ordeal of renovating an old house. I won't even begin to elucidate the complicated, disturbed, deep-rooted psychological/other issues between this couple other than go Janine! (Jennifer Connelly) towards the end of the movie.

Overall the movie should be seen more as a dark comedy or drama rather than a romantic one. My friend and I left (she's married and I engaged at the time and both having dated in the past obviously) with this horribly somber feeling that we were unable to express in words until days later. I was depressed and pitying, upset, and felt the characters in general were sad and utterly, self destructively unhappy. I get it's just a movie, based off a tag line, based off a book, etc...however the movie didn't do the point justice. More like promoted that if you are desperate enough, clingy enough, or demanding enough, you'll get what you want or get something you thought you wanted and realized you settled or pushed for something unnaturally against instinct from your partner. I was disappointed with the plot and certain aspects of pointless drama.",1243555200,5,4073,4.657858136300417
3385398,4,B00164KYV4,"Obviously this movie has hit a nerve with a large volume people, and whether you hate or love it the Blu managed to make for a nice product.

The 129 minutes does seem long, but the variety of color tests and hidef clarity showcasing this awesome cast makes for a watchable Blu. The colors, depth and scenery variety make for an adequate representation, including the sailing, the dark indoors, room decors, and Scarlett. The sound is uneventful but you do have the choice between TrueHD or normal 5.1. And if even just to hear Kristofferson's voice say anything in TrueHD, albeit only two scenes.

The special features are definitely...unique. If you liked the premise of that invisible wall being removed during the film - the ""interviews"" of the random people on the street - then you you will dig the main feature here.

* A ""newspaper"" format of the six couples/storylines that when selected, allows you to delve deeper into the characters' lives. Actually, brief excerpts can be seen during the credit sequence. Each one totals three minutes and admittedly, it peaked every single customer's interest when they saw it, because it seems real. Several people thought they were watching Hollywood couples being interviewed about their relationships. Bradley Cooper's ""interview"" gathered the biggest crowd, but irritated most of the guys watching.

* If one ever has interest into how much a phone conversation scene in a movie can be micromanaged, look no further. This four minute feature has the director dissect in detail how they made one of the phone call scenes have relevance that even the trained eye might miss. If anything, several people now wanted to watch the film again to see what the heck he was talking about.

* The inspiration and history of the film are covered in an eleven minute documentary, catered to the die hard fans.

* The deleted scenes total 13:45 and would have been much better left in - especially since we had already endured two+ hours of this. The commentary gives no credibility as to why Scarlet's actual singing was removed from the film. Coupled with Teresa Russel's entire role being cut, it just showcased the weakness in the writing people complain about in this film.

Big fans of the film will want this as a purchase, but since 90% of my Blu customers are guys, I foresee this as mostly a rental.",1243468800,18,2347,4.823383084577115
3385399,5,B00164KYV4,"this is a must-see movie for every girl from age 16, 18 to see - if He Is Just Not That Into You, what are you doing wasting the time in your life?

AND probably, really, you aren't that into him either - it's time for people who care about their friends, etc To Start Telling Everyone The Truth - no one wants to hurt anyone's feelings so instead most ""friends"" are just pumping each other up instead of helping each other to have a Better Real Life.

Girls and women have been wasting years and decades of their lives imagining they mean more to a guy than they do - and end up embittered and scared that they are unappealing.

Better to take a good look at one's self and evaluate one's true appeal: what is attractive and loveable about ourselves and what is NOT. then to assess our ""marketability"" and wait for that right moment, for a right one to come along - which is rare but DOES happen -

but to waste time making more of something or someone than it or he is? what IS up with that?!

better to be more selective, keep most guys as friends until they have proven they deserve a place in your heart - and become more wonderful every month and every year so that someone WILL come along and fall for you in a big way For Real.

until, then, proceed with caution - and start with The Honest Truth. and watch this movie and read the book [and other good books on love and relationships] - don't waste your youth or precious time making something out of nothing - when we got nothin', we gotta admit It's NoThing - it's not our time, our turn - and he's not The One For You -

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Two characters are desperately looking for love in the right places, but with the wrong guys.
2. One character is in love with another character, who's just not that into him.
3. One is married, but infatuated with another, who's also infatuated with him.
4. Two are living together, but only one of them wants to get married.
5. One has no intention of falling in love.

Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long, Jennifer Connelly, Ginnifer Goodwin, Kevin Connolly, and Bradley Cooper make up the star power for this romantic dramedy about relationships and falling in love.

All the main characters are also linked to other main characters through friendship or work, making for interesting mixing and matching, until the dust settles and the hearts fall where they may.

Several scenes and situations drag on too long, and the movie could have used a bit of editing for length, but overall not bad for a chick flick.

My bet is that guys will just not be that into this.

3385402,4,B00164KYV4,"I really wanted to see this movie. I did briefly peruse the book, though I personally never needed someone to slap me and say ""He's just not that into you!"". The pessimist in me always assumed the worst anyway. But none the less, the book was definitely funny.  I had seen the preview for this and like a lot of people in it. I was not disappointed! It seems people either liked or hated this movie, I fall into the like category. It kept my attention from beginning to end, which is very hard to do, I inevitably will be reaching for my computer to browse around online 8 times out of 10.

Some people find too many characters confusing, but these ones all were very distinct and no one over shadowed the other. Some of the relationships are fun and flirty, others seem destined to end. People have compared it to 'love,actually', though I personally didn't see any similarities besides the multiple 'relationships'. 'He's just not that into you' centered more around late 20's and 30's age people, I think 'love, actually' spanned a larger age range and not only were dating and married, but deaths, divorce and families. No one in this flick had families with their partner yet.

I think it's definitely worth checking it out, especially if you've dated and gotten mixed signals. You'll find lots of ""oh god, that's just like me!"" moments, both embarrassing and just plain true to life. Gigi, the narrator, is constantly reading too much into the actions of her dates and always convinced, sure maybe they like her but they're just getting side tracked from calling her. This story line alone was very cute and funny, on the other end of the spectrum there's a married couple having issues as well as a couple who has been together for 7 years and the girl is wondering ""why won't he marry me??""

Great, fun movies to check out with the girls. If you're not a perfect in every way couple, some of this might be uncomfortable to watch together.",1240531200,4,1946,4.583333333333333
