As a lady myself, it was so cool to find an indoor cycling session that featured all women AND not just any women-we're talking pro racers and other women who race. It was SO motivating to see the girls push themselves as they typically would do in a road race. And don't be fooled--this session isn't just for the girls. Guys, as well, will benefit tremendously from this workout. I recently did the 3LC Road Race and Ladies Road Race back-to-back (yeah, I like to suffer!), and both were equally as tough. As with all the 3LC workouts, with Ladies Road Race, I loved the encouragement and racing tips from the coaches, and intervals that simulate a real race with attacks, surges, climbing, pacelining. The coaches also have you imagine that you're outdoors in a real race, climbing, rolling through the valleys, etc. They keep you very focused on the task at hand. I absolutely loved racing with the hardcore ladies and can't wait to race with them again!",1392422400,,994,4.685714285714286
