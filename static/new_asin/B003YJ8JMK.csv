4229549,5,B003YJ8JMK,My husband saw this movie as a child but I had never seen it.  The scenery is breathtaking and the movie is one we will watch again.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  Loved it!!,1358467200,,187,4.138888888888889

4229551,5,B003YJ8JMK,"I had never heard of this movie until I caught it on TV a few weeks ago (and I watch a lot of old movies). It is as described in the other reviews. The scenery is so spectacular it makes me want to run to Sun Valley Idaho immediately.
One thing makes it worth watching by fans of off-beat movies. Granger spends the entire movie saying ""ey, be'be'"" (bay-bay) to Corey in an atrocious French accent. My husband was ignoring it as I watched it until even he couldn't look away. We were in hysterics over the ""ey be'be'"" every other sentence. And that phrase is used in the final scene of the movie for even further hysterics. Seriously, the movie was OK, but I have to buy it to rewatch and count the ""ey, be'be'"" repetitions.",1340064000,,724,4.291970802919708

4229553,5,B003YJ8JMK,I am 66 years old and when I was a youngster this was my dad's favorite movie of all time.  I remember watching it over and over.  He loved the wolf fight in it.  When I saw it on Amazon I couldn't believe it.  I bought it right away.  I have watched it and it brought back so many memories.  This is a good old movie and I wish they still made them like this.  No sex or cussing.  I recommend it highly.,1328572800,9,404,3.783132530120482
4229554,5,B003YJ8JMK,"This is one of my favorite 5 westerns of all time only surpassed by ""High Noon"", ""Across the Wide Missouri"", ""Shane"" and ""Saskatchewan"".
Stewart Granger was never more charming and more convincing than in this movie (although ""Scaramouche"" comes close).",1304294400,3,253,5.35

  A superb adventure in the Candadian unchartered North Country of Canada in which Wendell Corey is a mounted policeman chasing Stewart Granger, who killed a man in self defense, but is being brought in for a trial. Cyd Charisse, a famous dance beauty in real life, plays an Indian maiden waiting for Granger to return to her.

  Granger is a solitary trapper who knows the country, but Corey, the mounted policeman doesn't know the country when Corey catchs up to Granger, But trying to get back to the town for trial, Granger allows Corey to get lost in the snow and blizzard conditions. They both end up fighting a pack of wolves in which Corey is bitten in the neck and goes into a stupor. Granger brings Cory back tied to the sled as the ""mouse is bringing back the cat.""

  Granger could have left Corey in the snow a couple of times before this incident and escaped to freedom, but his morals wouldn't let him do it.

  It will take a wild ride down the rapids at the base town upon their return for Granger to bring Corey out of the stupor. The two, who were enemies, become close friends as Corey testifies on behalf of Granger at the trial.

  This movie was hard to get on DVD and it is worth buying and having it in one's collection.

  Action, adventure,and human drama are the words that describe this movie.",1288483200,22,1468,4.874493927125506
4229556,5,B003YJ8JMK,No problems!,1438905600,,12,5.5
4229557,4,B003YJ8JMK,"A poster blurb for THE FAR NORTH (1952) says it's a ""BIG drama of primitive love!""
What isn't apparent at first is the love shown is a curious one, that of a hunted
man for the Canadian constable who intends to bring him to justice for an admitted
murder. Stewart Granger plays the heavily French-accented fugitive; Wendell Corey
is his pursuer, a man determined to do his duty no matter the personal risk.

This adventure of two men battling the harshest elements, a wolf pack and other
perils is well done, despite an at times overbearingly melodramatic music track.

The plot has some surprising turns, and the film is always interesting. Idaho and
Grand Teton Park locations stand in well for the frigid country further north.",1433462400,2,730,4.785714285714286

4229563,5,B003YJ8JMK,"Beautifully done movie in scenic Canadian Mountie fashion. Stewart Granger is at his best. I am very particular what movies I add to my collection. I prefer family oriented movies that I can watch without anything to give me nightmares! This movie fits the bill for me.

What I like about it most is the respect shared between the 2 men, the beauty of the mountains.
I have recommended this movie to many of my friends.",1367366400,2,270,3.8392857142857144

The river scenes alone were well worth the price. If you love the great outdoors and survival against the elements stories, this is a great one. It keeps you entertained and is one of those classic movies you can watch again every year or so.",1515196800,,378,4.414285714285715
8409409,5,B003YJ8JMK,"Saw ""The Wild North"" on WPIX Channel 11 or maybe on channel 8 in NYC when I was a kid in the 80s. Remembered it was Stewart Granger and after the internet kicked in I searched for it online. Never could find it. Couldn't remember the proper name for the movie. Then one day I go on IMDB search through all of Stewart Granger's movies and find it and buy it off amazon. It arrived in no time and i sat down and watched it for the first time since I was teenager. Wow! Even better than i remember. The love story was natural, not overwrought or a distraction. The action was real, not fake or thrown in just for action sake. Taunt and thrilling, with Stewart Granger's laidback lines, with that lovely French Canadian accent, easing your way through the movie. Excellent.",1496793600,,769,4.384615384615385

8409412,5,B003YJ8JMK,"Ordinarily I'm not a fan of Stuart Granger...I just don't find him particularly charismatic...and his movies aren't always that, well...good.  However, this film is a huge exception.  Granger is terrific in The Wild North, particularly because the ""strong"" French accent suits him so well.  He really comes across as the character he's playing, not as Stuart Granger the actor.  There are other movies that feature beautiful cinematography of ""the great north,"" and many of these movies are extremely dull.  But his movie is never dull and the cinematography is spectacular.  The complex range of emotions the two male characters go through is unfailingly interesting, often gripping.  The ""psychological trauma"" ""snow-blind"" segment in the last reel is very well done.  I may have zero interest in seeing other Stuart Granger movies, but this one I'd want to see again: 100%.",1471132800,,876,5.251798561151079
8409413,2,B003YJ8JMK,"This is a flimsy, predictable melodrama whose principal point of interest is the beautiful country above Sun Valley, Idaho.  It's all predictable, corny, and silly.  Everyone is miscast.  Stewart Granger as a French tough guy and crook?  Cyd Charisse as the love interest?  Oh, they were all under contract to MGM, and what the heck.  It's a waste of time, and the DVD people have a lot of gall to charge a lot for a flick you can see on TCM.",1470700800,,442,4.395061728395062

8409416,4,B003YJ8JMK,This is a movie I have wanted a long time. Stewart Granger and Wendell Cory are wonderful actors. The only reason for knocking a star is that the rapids scene where the killing takes place is nowhere to be found. What a disappointment. This should be advertised as the edited version.,1452124800,3,284,4.588235294117647
