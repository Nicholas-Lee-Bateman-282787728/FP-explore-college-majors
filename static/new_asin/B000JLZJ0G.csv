8152230,5,B000JLZJ0G,"The gift I purchased was a Christmas gift for my sister.  The seller said part of the proceeds went to a library for Hurricane Katrina Relief.  Since this was a near new product, I decided to just take a sneak peak at the video.  Everything you want in a Pro Cheerleader/Dancer DVD is in here.  The routines are VERY professional, the warm-ups are good and the nutrition tips are right on.  I firmly give this five stars!  I'd give six if Amazon would let me.",1387324800,,459,4.341176470588235
8152231,3,B000JLZJ0G,"I got this DVD as I'm starting cheerleading soon and wanted to work on my dance and overall aerobic fitness specifically for cheering. At the time had I know that Cardio Cheer existed I would have purchased that as it was more work out based for cheerleading. This DVD has several routines you can master however when they teach them they don't break them down enough. You are taught too many moves at once and for a beginner it's really hard to follow. I had to keep stopping the DVD to go over the moves and build the routine myself. The exercise dance routines are even more difficult to follow for a beginner as they are full of jargon and terminology and are fairly fast. By the time I figured out what the girl was on about and tried to do it she had moved on. There are no notes on technique, which I knew beforehand from another review however I think that in some places a word or two about correct technique and what a specific move should look like and how to do it correctly would have been really helpful.

Overall if you are a complete beginner like me this DVD is ok, not perfect but it's workable.",1288310400,,1113,4.3
8152232,3,B000JLZJ0G,It isn't too hard to follow once you replay it a million times.  Otherwise the dance moves are great once you get them.  It seems to start off pretty slow but then it gets faster.,1244073600,,179,4.085714285714285
8152233,4,B000JLZJ0G,"This DVD although a little out of style is a perfect work out and prep video for cheer squads. It has Stretches, Motions, Cheers and Dance routines. I can't do without it!",1244073600,,171,4.375
8152234,2,B000JLZJ0G,"It's more of a choreography dvd than a workout one. I would more recomend it for 'advanced beginners', those who have a basic knowledge of the sport, but still need to learn at a slower pace.

As a former cheerleader, i disliked how some of the dance moves were 'flow-y', more like traditional dance. Cheer-dancing and Dancing are two very different genres, and this Dvd tried to attempt to combine them.",1241222400,,404,4.690140845070423
8152235,5,B000JLZJ0G,The recipient's comments: It's awesome! The best part is that it has SO MUCH stuff on it! The dance routines are so cute!!!!,1199750400,,124,4.434782608695652
8152236,5,B000JLZJ0G,"This DVD is GREAT! The dances were easy to learn and they provide an awesome workout! They have 6 dances from popular songs (granted they're like 30 seconds or more and not the full song) and they're all different. You have you're pop, hip-hop, and your contemporary cheer styles so you can choose what you're in the mood for. They also have two songs that they've choreographed poms into (""Holiday"" and ""Dig In"").

The Songs are:
**Crazy in Love (42 seconds)
**Let's Get it Started (1:03 minutes)
**Breathe, Stretch, Shake (56 seconds)
**Holiday (55 seconds)
**Dig In (1 minute)
**Lose My Breath (58 seconds)

And to top it all off, it comes with a CD that has the songs on it so you can impress your friends or take with you to games or practice!",1184457600,4,748,4.533333333333333
8152237,5,B000JLZJ0G,"my niece expressed a desire to be a cheerleader.  i came across this dvd and i gotta say, for the money, it's right on.  i'm not a cheerleader, but i know my niece loves it and has organized some good routines with her friends.",1176940800,3,227,4.136363636363637
8152238,5,B000JLZJ0G,"My daughter is on a youth cheer squad. This DVD is perfect. She loves the routines. She does them alone and with her friends. They're fun and the instruction is fabulous with the Cheeracise instructional flip. I've never seen that before and makes learning the dances easier. The plyometrics is great for her legs. Helps her stretch and strengthen. To tell you the truth, I've joined her a couple of times. My legs feel pretty good after that workout. I recommend this to any girl who cheers or wants to cheer and for any mom who needs to give a good gift too.",1175299200,2,560,4.446601941747573
8152239,5,B000JLZJ0G,"This is simply the best cheer DVD ever!!!!!  Perfect for all ages and ability levels.  It's fun, upbeat and informative.  Professional cheerleaders show you several routines, then break them down so you can learn at your own pace.  Not only will your cheerleading skills improve, but you'll build strength and flexibility too.  The best part is that they include a bonus music cd that you can take to the game or practice.  Cheerleading is highly competitive, and this product will definitely give you an edge!",1162166400,7,510,4.9411764705882355
