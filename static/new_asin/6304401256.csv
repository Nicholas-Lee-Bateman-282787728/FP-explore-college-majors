865989,5,6304401256,"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo is the third movie in the Love Bug series and overall the second best.  It takes place 12 years after the Love Bug as Jim Douglas tries to make a comeback with Herbie and a new mechanic, Wheely Applegate.  Along the way, two jewel thieves hide a $6 million dollar jewel in Herbie's gas tank which they try and retrieve throughout the movie.  Another subplot has Herbie falling in love with a car driven by Diane Darcy, the only female driver in the Trans France race.  While at times the subplots slow the movie down, it is still very enjoyable.  The movie returns to the roots of the Love Bug with the story focusing mostly on the racing where Herbie Rides Again and Herbie Goes Bananas go off on their own stories.  Both are decent but the racing story is missed.  In Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo the racing scenes are very well done during the qualifying rounds and also the Trans Fran.
  Dean Jones returns as Jim Douglas and gives another good performance as the driver who fully believes in Herbie and his ability now.  Don Knotts plays Wheely Applegate, Herbie's mechanic, and is very good with several funny scenes.  Jones and Knotts have good chemistry together throughout.  Julie Sommars is pretty good as Dianne Darcy, Roy Kinnear and Bernard Fox are funny as the bumbling thieves trying to get their diamond back, Jacques Martin plays the police inspector with alterior motives, Xavier Saint Macary as Lt. Fontenoy, the police officer trying to solve the case, and Eric Braeden as Bruno, the driver who tries over and over again to prevent Herbie from winning the race.  I hope that Disney puts this and many other classics out on DVD since it is harder and harder to find VHS copies of so many movies.  The Special Edition DVD for the Love Bug was great and should not be missed.  This is a really fun movie that is right up there with the Love Bug that shouldn't be missed for Herbie fans everywhere!",1059609600,10,1939,4.547550432276657

866152,4,6304401256,"It's been 12 years since Herbie, the Volkswagen with heart, first made his name--and owner Jim Douglas's (Dean Jones)--in road races, and now Jim has decided it's time for a comeback.  Going all out, he's entered himself and Herbie in a race from Paris to Monte Carlo--but they've barely arrived when Herbie flips his carburetor for a pretty blue Lancia driven by Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars), who, of course, doesn't know the truth about him and thinks everything that happens is a ploy by Jim to get her out of the race.  Meanwhile, unknown to Jim and his mechanic Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts), a pair of somewhat inept jewel thieves (Bernard Fox, Roy Kinnear) have managed to make away with a huge diamond and, to elude the police, have hidden it in Herbie's gas tank.  Now they have to get it back and rejoin the mastermind of the plot--none other than Insp. Bouchet (Jacques Marin, whom some viewers may recognize as ""Captain Brieux"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island-at-the-Top-of-the-World-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0001I55XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island at the Top of the World (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>)--while eluding his also inept but sometimes lucky assistant, Det. Fontenoy (Xavier Saint-Macary).  And Jim, Herbie, and Wheely have troubles of their own, namely rival racer Bruno Von Stickle (Eric Braeden), who's not above some dirty tricks to guarantee his own triumph.

It would have been nice had the writers explained what happened to Carole Bennett, whom Jim married at the end of the first film, and how Wheely learned the truth about Herbie.  For that reason, if I could give the movie three and a half stars instead of four, I probably would.  Still, it's a lively, funny, family-friendly movie that Herbie's legion of fans should enjoy.",1448841600,,1833,5.433098591549296

866232,1,6304401256,"What to say about this turkey.  I had modest hopes for it, based on the ridiculously-wonderful ""Love Bug"" and the enjoyable ""Herbie Rides Again"", but honestly, this movie is a slice of Limburger cheese (sorry for the food analogies).  I was looking forward to Dean Jones's return, but he can't do anything to help this lame plot involving inept thieves who hide a stolen diamond in Herbie's gas tank, while Herbie falls in love with a Lancia in the midst of a comeback race.  There's an absurd feminist angle and a story that's slow even at 1.4x playback.  I thought I couldn't go wrong, even at 43-cents for a used copy.  I went way wrong.  Now I can never claw-back those ninety-minutes and I may need therapy to recover from this road-apple.",1424304000,,744,4.598484848484849

866337,4,6304401256,"Set 12 years after the original THE LOVE BUG (but in reality it was only 8 years after THE LOVE BUG was released), HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is the third Herbie movie and features the return of Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his beloved racing Volkswagen Beetle, Herbie. It's been years since Douglas was a world-class race car driver and he's determined to get back in the circuit and start making a name for himself again by entering in the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, a cross country race from Paris to Monte Carlo. Joining Douglas and Herbie is Jim's friend and mechanic, Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts). The team is all set to race, but then Herbie ends up falling in head over wheels for a beautiful blue and yellow Lancia Montecarlo driven by female driver Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars), who's trying to break into the boys club of racing. Herbie's infatuation proves to be a problem, but there are other issues. Two jewel thieves working for a mysterious Agent X have stolen a large diamond from a museum and have stashed the item in Herbie's gas tank and begin having their own race to corner Herbie and get that diamond back. So, the Grand Prix Monte Carlo becomes a race not only against other racers, but against the thieves, too.

THE LOVE BUG remains the best of the Herbie movies, but HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is one of the better sequels. The film returns Herbie to his racing roots and it's really great having Dean Jones back in the driver's seat as Jim Douglas. Herbie is the Love Bug after all and a Herbie film wouldn't be complete without a love story or two. There's a good balance in the movie between action, romance, and humor. HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO has lots of laughs, several of which come from Don Knotts mugging it up for the camera  Knotts was a master of the double take and the expressions on his face are priceless. Personally, the only thing I was really disappointed about HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is that it never addresses what happened to Jim's wife, Carole, from the end of THE LOVE BUG, nor does it say what happened to Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett). In terms of DVDs, the HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO features no special features which is a little disappointing.

Overall, HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is fun and family-friendly movie filled with whimsical delight. It's an entertaining movie and a fine part of the Herbie canon.",1394841600,2,2373,4.578823529411765

866339,5,6304401256,"Good, clean family film. Lots of humor, no cussing or using God's name in vain, plenty of action, typical Don Knotts comedy.",1387670400,,124,4.681818181818182

866341,3,6304401256,"So where's his wife?  When last we saw Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), he was happily married to Carole Bennet (Michele Lee).  So where did he ditch her and why?  And why did he dump one nitwit sidekick (Buddy Hackett) only to gain nitwit supreme Don Knotts as Wheely Applegate in his place?  (Begs the question, who would name their kid Wheely?)
Otherwise, it's business as usual, beginning with the oil on the shoe gag.  There's a jewel heist.  Herbie ends up with the goods.  The thieves have to retrieve it.  Naturally, racing is involved; we're expected to accommodate the idea of Eric Braeden as a bad guy when all he does is smile and claim victory before the fact.  There really aren't any hardcore bad guys this time out, just a lot of greedy goons with a predilection for bungling.  The romantic interest comes from an angry Julie Sommars and her Lancia Scorpion named Giselle.  Herbie is animated to such a degree that he might as well be a cartoon.  All that's lacking at this point is the power of speech.

The transfer is a bit grainy; it's fullscreen instead of widescreen.  There's nothing offensive presented, just a lot of humor that may or may not provide a laugh.  It seems a bit tired at this point.  Shouldn't they have retired the poor car by now?",1376092800,,1264,4.5265486725663715

866389,5,6304401256,"The entire Herbie creation is an amazing idea and series of movies.  I watched this Herbie with my 8 yr old daughters and it was a big hit.  It has many great stunts, using real vehicles, instead of ""fake"" props or poorly done back screen photography.  The double romance between the 2 drivers (Dean Jones and Julie Sommars) and the 2 race cars was a whole lot of fun to watch.  Of all the various Herbies across the years, we like this one the best.  Don Knotts adds a comedic element that is totally warm hearted and enjoyable.  The German villain, played by Eric Braeden (Rat Patrol & The Young and the Restless fame) added a real tough German vs underdog feel. I really liked the cars (together forever). They both had a mind of their own.  It's a great movie for family and friends. I bet you will like it too. Of course, for you physics buffs out there, you have to accept a few scenes where Herbie is ""magical""...  Defying gravity, running underwater, etc...  but hey, Herbie can do it all!!!  It's totally better on a cold winter day.  We recommend watching this movie by the fire with hot chocolate.  Very cozy cozy. ;)",1361059200,,1128,4.422330097087379

Herbie animatronics allow him too Waltzes in front of Giselle, blink his headlights, open and close his hood, and move his wheels horizontal in a expression of awe as he watches Giselle tie his record breaking time for the course.

Herbie wins the Giselles heart after rescuing and extracting the car from the lake shoreline.  Diane Darcy tells Jim, Wheely, and Herbie ""win the race for them"".  Herbie wins the race and Jim and Wheely are famous again.

Herbie has an engine with the ability of tachometer readings of 7,000 rpm making him faster than the  Black Pantheria driven by Claude Gilbert and the Laser 917 GT coupe driven by Von Stickle.  Jim Douglas and Wheely Applegate have returned to race after 12 years.  Jim and Diane are high-spirited and both enjoy a good fight.  Diane gets the better end of the argument, as she manages to throw a vase, picture, and books at Jim keeping him dodging the projectiles.  Diane thinks Jim is against her being a woman racer.  Jim is just bullhead about Diane and thinking she is treacherously trying to disqualify him.  Later Diane apologizes and the couple end up kissing each other.

866528,4,6304401256,"Now, I'm not one for oldie's flicks at all anymore, but I think that Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo is probably the only Herbie movie that I would watch if someone put it in the tape player. It's fun and entertaining, and the international racing scene was a great and hilarious choice for Herbie to have his latest escapade. Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo is also a well-cast movie, with the extremely funny pairing of Dean Jones and Don Knotts kicking the laughs up quite a few notches. It manages to provide the occasional silliness and hilarious laughs that kids enjoy, also satisfying fans of international car racing, of course, while adding car-racing action tricks that are out-of-this-world! In other words, whether you are a fan of action-packed car racing flicks or funny, cute comedies, you should watch this movie because it has just the right mixture of both!

 Dean Jones plays Jim Douglas, who decides, after Herbie's success in all those races, to enter him in the Paris-to-Monte-Carlo road race. However, Jim and his funny friend, Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts), have no idea the trouble they are about to be entangled in. A gang of jewel thieves steals a precious gem from a museum in France and the news of the robbery breaks around almost instantly. Feeling pressured and hasty, the jewel thieves tuck the gem into Herbie's gas tank and vow to return for it later. What ensues is a series of complicated mishaps and hilarious adverntures that could only be seen in a Herbie movie!",1148342400,,1492,4.77906976744186
866529,4,6304401256,"Twelve years after leaving the racing scene, Jim Douglas and his living Volkswagen, Herbie, are set to make their comeback! They're entering the Trans-France Race from Paris to Monte Carlo, and they're not going to let anything stop them from regaining their superstar status! That's the intention anyway. But when fate throws a monkey wrench into their golden plan in the form of a lovely European racecar, it's all Jim and mechanic Wheely can do to keep Herbie's eyes on the prize! Of course, this is a comedy about Americans visiting Paris, so you've got to have some diamond heisting! While Jim and Wheely try their best to reason with Herbie and his dreamcar's untrusting female driver, they have no clue that two thieves working for a much bigger mastermind have stashed an enormous stolen diamond in Herbie's gas tank! As the thieves try to get their hands on love-struck Herbie and the diamond, the police chase after the thieves, even during the big race! And Jim and Wheely thought the only thing they had to worry about was their bullying European competition!

""Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo"" is another excellent entry into Disney's still thriving Herbie franchise! The film is not without its quirks though. For example, what happened to Jim Douglas's wife, Carole, whom he married at the end of the original ""Love Bug"" film? And, why is it set 12 years after their last race, when, in fact, it was only made 8 years after the first film? Well, regardless, this third film about ol' Number Fifty-Three is no less fun, fanciful, and fantastic than any of Herbie's other wonderful sequels. There are plenty of great laughs thanks in no small-part to the genius of Don Knotts (who just passed on two nights ago and will be greatly missed) in the role of Herbie's mechanic, Wheely Applegate. It's also a real treat to see Dean Jones back in the driver's seat reprising his role as Jim Douglas from the original Herbie film, ""The Love Bug."" The jewel thief plot may be a bit goofy, but it's good fun and adventure in the usual Herbie style, with plenty of the great character actors of the day and the expected, fantastic Herbie stunts! Plus, Herbie gets a girlfriend! Their onscreen romance is a great source of humor and heart! If you've got the kind of beautifully naive imagination that allows you to enjoy the fruits of 1970s Disney, this film is for you! And, I urge you to pick up the complete boxed set of the first four Herbie films, followed by the Bruce Campbell ""Love Bug"" TV movie on VHS, and the new DVD release of  ""Herbie: Fully Loaded!"" All are well worth your time, and yes, those last two ARE sequels, even if they are constantly referred to as remakes (even by Disney archivists)! Now, the early Herbie sequels don't include any DVD extras, and ""Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo"" isn't even presented in widescreen. It's a jip to be sure, but as a diehard Herbie fan, I'm just thrilled to finally have all these wonderful movies on home video, and I truly hope the TV movie and TV series get some DVD releases in the near future too!",1140912000,6,3053,4.630996309963099

866531,5,6304401256,"Jim Douglas and Herbie are coming out of retirement.  And they've decided to do it in grand style, in the new Monte Carlo Relay in France.  They've hardly arrived when two jewel thieves decide to hide a priceless diamond in Herbie's gas tank.  As if that weren't enough, Herbie has fallen head over heels for a cute little Lancia also in the race, and Jim is finding her fiery driver rather irresistible as well.  This is going to be complicated race.
This was actually the last of the original Herbie movies I saw, and is probably my least favorite.  Still, it's loads of fun.  Part of this is because there is so much going on.  Between the love plots, the thieves, and the race, there's hardly a dull moment.  Don Knotts is not a favorite of mine and gets on my nerves here, as does Xavier Saint-Macary as an over eager detective.  Still, the rest of the cast is fine.  I was a bit disappointed that there is no mention of Carole from the first movie.  And, of course, they completely changed the gas cap to make that plot work.  But then again, how can you nit pick a movie about a car that thinks for itself?
Disney could have done much better with this DVD.  The picture is presented in full frame, cropping the sides of the picture from its original release.  What we do have has some grain and dirt, but looks remarkable well for its age.  The sound is full surround and sounds wonderful.  As with the other Herbie sequels, there are no extras.
Even being the last one I saw, this movie has a wonderful nostalgia appeal to me because of Herbie.  How I loved that car as a kid!  Any one else who grew up loving Herbie will want this DVD since it seems to be the best Disney will offer us for the foreseeable future.",1086825600,2,1722,4.311526479750778
866532,1,6304401256,"Disney is NOT adding any features whatsoever for the Herbie, the Love Bug sequels. The only thing that could possibly be of any good quality within these discs would be a remastering of the picture and sound.  Unless you've given up using your VCR or you are a collector, don't waste your time purchasing the Herbie sequels.  Only the original movie, The Love Bug is worthy of it's ""Special Edition"" title.",1080086400,5,406,4.704225352112676
