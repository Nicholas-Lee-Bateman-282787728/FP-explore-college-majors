4485223,4,B004W48KJ8,"Love Rey Mysterio. The Biggest Little Man set was good. But this new set includes a sit down interview which as one reviewer said similar to HBK's My Journey set. I love these sit down interviews because it gives a chance for the wrestlers to speak about the matches that are on this set. I hope to see more of these sets. What would make these sets good is if the wrestlers themselves pick the content (match and other stuff) that would be on it. That's what made me buy the Bret Hart set. By the way, the next edition of a sit down set should be with him IMO.

Only reviewing matches.

Disc One

Rey Misterio Jr. & Konnan vs. La Parka & Psicosis
ECW Hardcore TV 28th October, 1995 - It was ok-ish/sometimes good. But he's had better ECW bouts.

2 out of 3 Falls Match
Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guerrera
ECW Extreme Bash 9th March, 1996 - Now this, I liked!

Experiencing ECW

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guerrera
WCW Pro Wrestling 3rd November, 1996 - I don't know about this one. I didn't hate it but....

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Chavo Guerrero Jr.
WCW Saturday Night 11th January, 1997 - These 2 never had a bad match. But their WWE stuff was better IMO.

Eddie's Guidance

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Eddie Guerrero
Nitro 8th September, 1997 - Same comment as the previous match except while these 2 had great matches in WWE, their WCW bouts were just as good if not better. I'd say the same about ECW but I don't know if they met there or know how long they were there.

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Chris Jericho
Nitro 17th November, 1997 - Same comment as the previous match.

The Creation of the Mask

Rey Mysterio Jr., Super Calo & Hector Garza vs. Psychosis, La Parka & Silver King
WCW Saturday Night 17th January, 1998 - Compared to Rey's other WCW bouts, this was ok.

Rey Mysterio Jr. & Billy Kidman vs. Eddie Guerrero & Juventud Guerrera
Nitro 28th December, 1998 - Better than the previous match IMO. Wish the Rey vs Eddie ""Title Vs Mask"" match was here. I know it was on another set. But I would love to hear Rey's comment on the match.

Who's That Jumpin' Out the Sky?

#1 Contenders Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship
Rey Mysterio & Edge vs. Eddie & Chavo Guerrero
SmackDown 24th October, 2002 - While this was DEFINITELY good, I wish they added the tag match from No Mercy 2002 too.

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team
Vengeance 27th July, 2003 - Another good tag match.

6-1-9

Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle
SmackDown 28th October, 2004 - This was a GREAT match IMO that was topped only by their SSlam 2002 encounter. That & their SmackDown 2003 (forgot date but I think it was after the Royal Rumble) bout should've been here too.

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Eddie Guerrero & Booker T. vs. Rey Mysterio & Rob Van Dam
SmackDown 30th December, 2004 - GREAT match IMO. Also, the Rey/RVD vs Dudleyz from J.Day 2004 was just as good. But it's not on here for some reason.

Disc Two

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero
WrestleMania 21 3rd April, 2005 - This was VERY, VERY GOOD/GREAT but feel their SSlam 05 Ladder match should've been here too.

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Rey Mysterio & Batista vs. MNM
SmackDown 16th December, 2005 - This was good. Real good.

On Top of the World

Mysterio's Opportunity for a World Heavyweight Championship Match at WrestleMania 22 is on the Line
Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton
No Way Out 19th February, 2006 - VERY GOOD MATCH!!!

Viva Mxico!

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero
SummerSlam 26th August, 2007 - I said these 2 never had bad match. But they've had better ones than this (Mo Mercy 2006, I Quit Match from SD). IMO, it's only here because it was Rey's return.

Stretcher Match
Rey Mysterio vs. Finlay
Cyber Sunday 27th October, 2007 - I liked this match. I rarely say that about ppv openers.

Putting the Mask on the Line

If Rey Mysterio Loses, He Must Unmask
Rey Mysterio vs. Kane
No Mercy 5th October, 2008 - I feel they've had better matches. I don't know why but I just couldn't get into this one till near the end.

Intercontinental Championship Match
Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho
Judgment Day 17th May, 2009 - Their GAB match would've also been a welcome addition. But this was really good too because these 2 gelled very well together everytime I've seen them against each other.

The Art of Mysterio

Intercontinental Championship Match
Rey Mysterio vs. John Morrison
SmackDown 4th September, 2009 - GOOD match here!!

Disk Three

#1 Contenders Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Rey Mysterio vs. Batista
SmackDown 18th December, 2009 - Two friends turned bitter enemies. Glad their SSeries match isn't here. I really liked their Steel Cage match. But this was a good one too.

Rey Mysterio vs. Shawn Michaels
SmackDown 29th January, 2010 - TOO GOOD FOR WORDS!!! Watch for HBK's Sweet Chin Music in the end. It's similar to the one he gave Shelton Benjamin when they met on RAW in 2005.

Coping with Injuries

World Heavyweight Championship Match
The Undertaker vs. Rey Mysterio
Royal Rumble 31st January, 2010 - Many think this was bad because of the match time. But I really like it a lot. Wouldn't mind seeing it go longer. These 2 really work well together which doesn't surprise me at all.

Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match
Rey Mysterio vs. Dolph Ziggler
SmackDown 5th February, 2010 - While this was really good, is it just me or was their SSslam 09 match better?

Alone Time

Rey Mysterio Joins the SES vs. CM Punk's Hair
Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk
Over the Limit 23rd May, 2010 - A really good one. Too bad they didn't get the time they deserved at WM.

""I Can't Do It Solo.""

Fatal 4-Way World Heavyweight Championship Match
Jack Swagger vs. Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk vs. The Big Show
WWE Fatal 4-Way 20th June, 2010 - VERY GOOD because of Rey & Punk's involvement.

Opportunity Knocks

Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto Del Rio
SmackDown 18th October, 2010 - I liked this match.

Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes
WrestleMania XXVII 3rd April, 2011 - Like his WM match with Punk, this just wasn't given the time I feel it deserved to have. They should have put their other ppv match here instead.

Overall, while some matches could be added in additon to what's here with others being replaced, this is still a good set & should be purchased if you're a Rey Mysterio fan or a fan of his style. I love these sit down sets. HBK's was great. Rey's was good. Bret Hart should be next IMO as should Stone Cold with others to follow. I know they're doing Rivalry DVD sets too. I think the Bret/HBK one that that's being worked on is the first (not sure though). They're also working on or will work on a Stone Cold vs Rock set. But I think Rey should get one too - Rey vs Eddie.",1310601600,,6773,4.484502446982056
4485224,4,B004W48KJ8,"When I heard this DVD was going to feature a sit down interview with Rey Mysterio discussing his career (similar to Shawn Michaels in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Shawn-Michaels-My-Journey/dp/B0030BS1HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Shawn Michaels - My Journey</a>&nbsp;DVD)
I knew I had to pick this one up. I hoped the interview would be good, but it far exceeded my expectations. This may be the WWE's best interview they've ever produced for a DVD. Rey openly discusses
his career. You'll hear insider information like what Rey's masks and tattoos mean, how he developed a friendship with the legendary Mil Mascaras, his induction into the AAA Hall of Fame, his time in
AAA & CMLL, his ECW experience and what it meant to his career, favorite matches and opponents, the legacy of the mask in lucha libre and tons more! If this DVD set was just Rey talking about his
career, I would've been very pleased with that. Matt Stryker is the host and he does an excellent job interviewing Rey. Their conversation sounds like two old friends just kicking back and reminiscing.
I have just two small complaints with the interview, they ignored the fact that Rey lost his mask in WCW and there were a few times when the interview turned kayfabe (when Rey talks about his feud
with Kane for instance). Those two flaws aside, the interview is easily the main reason to pick this one up. Now, let's talk about the match selection...

Unfortunately, the match selection is what really brings this DVD set down. The majority of these matches are no where near what I would consider to be the best of Rey's work. I guess WWE went with
lesser known, mediocre matches because Rey's best matches have already been released multiple times on previous WWE DVDs. For example, in the interview Rey talks about how his match with
Eddie Guerrero from WrestleMania XXI wasn't very good, so what does WWE do? They put it on the DVD. What I wish WWE had done for this release to really make it special is what they've done for
Chris Jericho's and Chris Benoit's DVDs and that's license footage from tape libraries they don't own. For example, they could've licensed some matches from AAA and CMLL. I don't know if they tried
to do this and were denied or they just didn't want to spend the money, but that would've put this release over the top for me. Rey talked so much about his time in Mexico during the interview that
it really makes you want to see some of his work from those promotions. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some great matches on this set. Rey Mysterio vs John Morrison for the Intercontinental
Title from Smackdown is here and it's a WrestleMania worthy match! Rey vs Shawn Michaels from Smackdown is also included and this is a much better match than their tribute match to Eddie Guerrero
from Raw. Rey's favorite tag-team match of his career thus far is also included: Rey & Billy Kidman vs The World's Greatest Tag-Team from Vengeance '03. So while there are some mediocre matches
that really bring this set down, there are some must see bouts here. I just wish WWE had gone the extra mile for Rey since he's one of their top stars.

Overall, if your a casual fan of Rey, I would recommend starting off with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Rey-Mysterio-619/dp/B00008HCA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - Rey Mysterio 619</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Rey-Mysterio-The-Biggest-Little-Man/dp/B000LC3ILK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Rey Mysterio - The Biggest Little Man</a>&nbsp;since those
DVDs contain his best matches and just skipping this one. However, if you're a fan of Rey's this is a must buy for the interview segments and the handful of must-see matches. I wish WWE would do
more sit down interview style DVDs with top wrestlers, it's a great format.

For what it's worth, the packaging is some of the best I've ever seen for a WWE DVD. The case opens up to reveal some killer images of Rey and while there's no insert, they did print the track listing
on the back cover for easy reference.",1310515200,3,4167,5.134020618556701
4485225,5,B004W48KJ8,"This new DVD on Rey Mysterio is excellently produced. The format of the production is a sit-down interview conducted by Matt Striker in which they get into the beginnings of Rey Mysterio, from when he was ""The Green Lizard"", ""Colibri"" and finally Rey Mysterio Jr, as well as comments on his extremely succesful run in the WWE. The sequence followed throughout the DVD is a small portion of the interview followed by two consecutive matches.
The following are a few characteristics about the presentation:
*This DVD set works great as a ""visual aid"" to the book ""Rey Mysterio: Behind The Mask"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/By-Jeremy-Roberts-Rey-Mysterio-Behind-the-Mask-Wwe/dp/B004T4NHT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">By Jeremy Roberts: Rey Mysterio: Behind the Mask (Wwe)</a>
*The DVD doesn't come with an insert with the content listing, instead it comes printed on the inside cover.
*The cover picture is very cool, they added a shiny effect to it.

Overall, this is a great product. The production values are awesome, excellent matches, and great insight from the man once known as ""The Green Lizard"", Rey Mysterio! This is a must-have for any collection and for any hardcore fan!

8444348,4,B004W48KJ8,"WWE proclaims himself as the greatest ""underdog"" in sports entertainment & with him being one of the most popular stars in the ""WWE Universe"", another DVD set has been released featuring Rey Mysterio. Now this DVD is setup the same way that the previous Shawn Michaels ""My Journey"" DVD is setup where they are in a studio for a sitdown one on one interview (conducted by Matt Striker) surrounded by various photos & mask from Mysterio's career. In between matches we'll hear Mysterio comment on various subjects such as what attracted him to the business, earning the name ""Rey Mysterio"", Konnan's influence on lucha libre in the United States, differences between performing on & off television, the funny story behind the first time he met Chris Jericho, designing the mask & his favorites from other wrestlers, what the rapper Ludacris had to do with one of his signature moves, his unique WrestleMania ring outfits, going into the Hall Of Fame in Mexico, describing his tattoos & injuries, what his dream matches are, ect.

Matches Include:
w/Konnan vs. La Parka & Psicosis - This match was edited for television as ECW used to do that with various matches back when they syndicated the show but was a good showcase for Mysterio showing off his high flying tactics such as a somersault splash onto the outside along with a frankensteiner off the top rope to the floor along with other unique moves such as a drop toehold on Psicosis that sent him out of the ring.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Oct. 95

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match vs. Juventud Guerrera - Rey started out early going for a submission with a move straight out of Great Muta's playbook with a combination of a leg scissors & facelock while performing his high risk offense such as a slingshot moonsault onto Juvi on the outside while Juvi went for more high impact moves such as a brainbuster & a springboard somersault kick that hit Rey right in the mouth. They got more creative as Rey did a frankensteiner off the top rope onto Juvi who was on the apron to the floor & using the referee as a springboard for a somersault dive onto the outside. It was during the final fall where both men really took it to the ""extreme"" with both executing springboard moonsaults into the crowd & one man catching the other coming off the top rope into a powerbomb before the fight went outside where the famous scene happened with Mysterio doing the frankensteiner off the hood of a car. This was probably each man's most famous match in ECW as this had the best case of lucha libre mixed with the ""hardcore"" ECW environment & say tune after the match as the hardcore action wasn't over.
""ECW Extreme Bash"" Mar. 96
[ECW Hardcore History]

vs. Juventud Guerrera - To my knowledge, this is the first ever ""WCW Pro"" match that's ever been released onto DVD but the only downside to this is that with this not being one of the top WCW shows, the matches were mostly just a background for the announcers to plug the upcoming Nitro & top storylines in the company than calling the match. This had it's moments like Juvi executing a flip sitdown splash & an attempted top rope powerbomb reversed in midair into a frankensteiner but past this, it was just a short average match.
""WCW Pro Wrestling"" Nov. 96

vs. Chavo Guerrero Jr. - Before they would go on to have their most famous matches in WWE, this happened back when Chavo was still in the early stages of his career & had the strategy of countering Mysterio's fast paced high flying match by doing the complete opposite of working a slower pace & grounding Mysterio with moves such as the camel clutch & boston crab submissions. We got the usual performance from Mysterio here but it was an impressive showcase for Chavo in his early years.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Jan. 97

vs. Eddie Guerrero - According to Mike Tenay on commentary, this was the first solo meeting between both men while also Mysterio's first match back from his feud against Konnan that injured his knee. Eddie went right after Rey's arm working it over with various shoulderbreakers & armbars while doing very impactful moves such as a backbreaker & powerbomb but Rey relied on his usual fast paced high flying offense but ended up tweaking his knee in the process that caused him to favor it throughout the match. This was more like a preview for their upcoming matches in both WCW & WWE but still quality for television.
""WCW Nitro"" Sept. 97

vs. Chris Jericho - Just like the previous match with Eddie, this was also the first one on one meeting between both of these men with you getting a chuckle out of how Jericho reacted to the fact that he had pyro during his entrance for the first time. Jericho showcased his strength advantage in the beginning with moves such as super gorilla press slam off the top rope before Jericho started foreshadowing his eventual heel turn by being more aggressive such as dragging Mysterio around by his mask & kicking him straight in the face along with constantly picking Rey up at one moment just to keep delivering backbreakers & later do the same with a powerbomb. This was very similar to the previous match in that this was more of a preview for their more classic quality encounters to come but still a good match.
""WCW Nitro"" Nov. 97

w/Super Calo & Hector Garza vs. Psychosis, La Parka, Silver King - This was a short but fun six man tag team match that had it's moments such as each team ganging up on one member of the other team, tons of high flying from everyone involved, and Rey's springboard frankensteiner on La Parka who was crotched on the top rope.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Jan. 98

w/Billy Kidman vs. Eddie Guerrero & Juventud Guerrera - During this time, Eddie Guerrero had a factor called the Latino World Order (L.W.O.) which included Juventud Guerrera but also forced Rey Mysterio to be a member as well (just like the John Cena/Nexus storyline). This match happened the night after Starrcade where both Eddie & Juvi were pinned by Kidman in back to back Crusierweight title matches so there was tension between Eddie & Juvi due to that. Juvi kept trying to prove himself to Eddie causing both men to be unable to get on the same page causing Rey & Kidman being able to take advantage at times such as dropkicking Juvi into Eddie causing both to go over the top rope followed by dual somersault flips. This match got more impactful & fast paced as time went as such as Eddie working over the neck with an impactful powerbomb & a giant swing that turned into a neckbreaker along with Rey & Kidman later delivering a powerbomb/West Coast Pop combination.
""WCW Nitro"" Dec. 98

w/Edge vs. Eddie & Chavo Guerrero - During this period on SmackDown, new tag team titles were created for SmackDown & the tournament was won by Chris Benoit & Kurt Angle so this was the #1 contenders match. Eddie & Chavo singled out Rey & worked him over throughout the match including using him as a battery ram to take out Edge only for them to return the favor later by taking out Eddie so Chavo would be singled out This was full of fast paced action with both teams trying to give the other a taste of their own medicine.
""SmackDown"" Oct. 02

w/Billy Kidman vs. WWE Tag Team Champions World's Greatest Tag Team - Hass & Benjamin singled out Rey at the start of the match & worked him over by making quick tags to keep a fresh member in the ring while also grounding him while later focusing on Kidman's back as Hass & Benjamin performed such double team moves such as a backbreaker & even the Road Warriors' Doomsday Device. Rey & Kidman stuck to what they did best with their aerial offense including Kidman doing a shooting star press from the middle of the top rope onto the floor at one point. There is too much action for me to try to summarize & describe it all but Rey stated that this was the best tag team match was ever in & you can you see why he thought that here as Michael Cole described this match perfectly, ""fast & furious action!""
Vengeance 03

vs. Kurt Angle - Both men attempted to play mind games with each other early (down to Mysterio's ring attire) with Rey getting the upper hand causing Kurt to get frustrated. Kurt used the strategy of trying to ground Rey & work a slower pace via such moves as the various german suplexes he delivered throughout the match. Mysterio kept trying to pick up the pace & pulled off some quick moves on Angle such as a tilt-a-wirl DDT along with a bulldog. With this being a preview of the upcoming Survivor Series elimination match, you saw members of each team throughout the match but this was still a good encounter.
""SmackDown"" Oct. 04

WWE Tag Team Championship Match w/Rob Van Dam vs. Eddie Guerrero & Booker T - For a short time, Eddie & Booker T were a tag team & were personally selected by RVD & Rey to defend their titles against. This was a very good back & forth match that started off slow & built up the pace over time with both teams knowing the other so well that we had a bunch of counters of the others signature moves. During the short time Mysterio & RVD were tag team champions, this was the most competitive they had as all four men knew each other real well along with the little trivia fact that one member of one team either was (RVD/Booker) or would be (Mysterio/Eddie) a tag team champion with a member of the opposite team.
""SmackDown"" Dec. 04

vs. Eddie Guerrero - Both men walked into this match as WWE Tag Team Championship partners while Rey came out in his traditional unique WrestleMania outfit that definately represented his Mexican heritage being in Los Angeles. Both men did some back & forth wrestling with Eddie getting getting the upper hand by monkeyflipping Mysterio to the outside of the ring. Eddie tried various submission holds such as the surfboard & STF while also delievering various backbreakers & vertical suplexes while Rey relied on an aerial attack such as the corkscrew plancha over the top & later a seated senton. Both men knew each other so well that we got a bunch of sequences out counter & escaping each others holds in what was a great opening match for WrestleMania.
As a special side note, pay attention to one of Mysterio's interviews on this DVD to find out a ""behind the scenes"" story about the issues Rey was having that effected this match.
WrestleMania 21

w/Batista vs. WWE Tag Team Champions MNM - They didn't show this on the DVD but earlier in the night, Melina tried to ""influence"" Batista into not taking this match but once she was done, he just thanked her for the ""warm up"" which led to Melina being so upset that she didn't do her normal entrance here & wanted the paparazzi away from her. Rey & Batista dominated here with their combination of speed & power to the point where MNM had to cheat with double teams & dirty tactics to gain an advantage. This was classic tag team wrestling here with MNM using the strategy of working over the weaker (on in this case, smaller) member of the team in Rey & keeping him from Batista with even Melina getting involved building up to the hot tag to Batista. Good quality match with the bigger issue here being two of Eddie Guerrero's close friends winning a championship in dedication to him.
""SmackDown"" Dec. 05

vs. Randy Orton - I won't waste space about the Eddie Guerrero storyline going into this except for the fact that I didn't like it PERIOD! As for the match, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything memorable. You would think they would have the whole ""Mysterio's gonna kill him"" mentality based off everything involving the storyline but Mysterio had no emotion in this match & just ""walked through"" his performance while Orton just DOMINATED the whole match and got a cheap pin at the end. If you get the chance, check out the match they had on the ""History Of World Heavyweight Championship"" DVD as that was quality.
No Way Out 06

vs. Chavo Guerrero - Before I get started, what was Rey thinking with that body paint? He came off as someone who forgot to rub in his lotion instead of the intended ""Silver Surfer"" character. This surpassed their match the previous year but not their greatest encounter (which I thought was their Bash '04 match). Chavo working on Rey's leg that he injured a year ago & Rey heavily selling it made for good in-ring storytelling.
SummerSlam 07

Stretcher Match vs. Finlay - Although it was a stretcher match, you could tell they had a plan set up no matter what the match was since they're all no disqualification as they used the sheiligh (sp?) on the pole anyways. This was a nice opener as Mysterio was bounced on the stretch various times & used kicks that were straight out of Tajiri's old playbook. Good match.
Cyber Sunday 07

vs. Kane - The stipulation here was that if Mysterio loses, he must unmask. Normally I don't like these ""David vs. Goliath"" matches with Mysterio as he's just regulated to being nothing more than a spot monkey to make the other guy look big & dominate (just look at his World Title reign) but that wasn't the case here as Rey got some good offense in, was able to hold his own against Kane here, and took one hell of a chairshot.
No Mercy 08

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Chris Jericho - The entire match was around what Chris Jericho guaranteed wouldn't happened, Mysterio wouldn't hit the 6-1-9 on him. Great back & forth paced match here with Jericho pulling out some moves like TNA wrestler Abyss' ""Shock Treatment"" backbreaker along with other counters to Mysterio's fast high flying offense like the Walls Of Jericho at one point. One point of this match would also plant the seeds for what the future basis of their feud would be based off. Another great match here with the crowd getting more into it over time.
Judgment Day 09

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. John Morrison - The match started off quick paced & kept that way throughout the bout leading a match full of non-stop action such as Mysterio rotating about Morrison's body twice to get a head scissors, Morrison doing a backwards flip kick to Mysterio's face & later doing a dropkick onto Mysterio in mid-air while delivering the most impactful ""Starship Pain"" I've seen. Add in both men giving each other loud kick & so many close near falls that the crowd couldn't help but chant ""THIS IS AWESOME!"" in a performance that had Jim Ross say, ""No one can say that John Morrison didn't earn the Intercontinental Championship."" This was one of the best matches on free television throughout the year.
""SmackDown"" Sept. 09
[John Morrison: Rock Star]

vs. Batista - Rey was out for revenge here due to Batista completely destroying him in their last encounter at Survivor Series with the extra stipulation that the winner of this match would get a shot at Undertaker's World Title. Batista grounded Rey & used his superiors power advantage early as Rey had to counter with his speed & aerial assault such as his seated senton onto Batista on the floor. Various times throughout the match, Batista was able to catch Rey & just pound on him slowing down the pace in the process while Rey didn't give up & kept a fast pace that worked to his advantage. This was a nice match between the two that would only be topped by their steel cage match a month later (that was on the ""Best Of SmackDown 2009-2010"" DVD).
""SmackDown"" Dec. 09

vs. Shawn Michaels - This is only the second time they've met one on one (first time on the Eddie Guerrero RAW tribute show) making this one of the rare times Shawn went against someone who was smaller & quicker than himself which did ending up catching HBK off guard including one moment where he went for Sweet Chin Music & Rey slid under his leg. Shawn focused on keeping Mysterio down through various chops while Rey went after his legs with various kicks only for Shawn to do the same thing later on. They were able to come up with some unique counters & ways to execute their trademark moves off Sweet Chin Music & 619 on each other towards the end in what was a real good quality match for SmackDown.
""SmackDown"" Jan. 10
[Best Of SmackDown 2009-2010 (Blu-Ray Edition)]

vs. World Champion Undertaker - Just by looking at these two, you got the type of match expected here in that it was ""David vs. Goliath"" and just like usual when Mysterio plays the ""David"" role, he puts up one hell of a fight. Taker showcased his superior power early by just tossing Mysterio over the top in the opening moments & blocking Mysterio's high flying moves. Mysterio did the old Bret Hart strategy by working on Taker's legs, made Taker's nose bleed from various kicks to the face, and even hit two 619's before he got caught with the Last Ride. This was the best non-Rumble match of the night & was a good encounter.
Royal Rumble 10

vs. Dolph Ziggler - This was a qualifying match for the Elimination Chamber match as Rey came into the match with bruised ribs which Dolph targeted with various backbreakers & even dropkicking Rey in mid-air right into his ribs but Mysterio refused to stay down. This was pretty short & good for what it was but I would have preferred to see one of their matches from their series over the Intercontinental Championship months earlier.
""SmackDown"" Feb. 10

vs. C.M. Punk - At WrestleMania, Mysterio won the match where he would have to join the S.E.S. if he won while Punk won the rematch where his hair was on the line...so this is the final encounter with both stipulations from the previous matches applying here while the S.E.S. were banned from ringside. The match started off quick before Mysterio did a head scissors that drove Punk into the ringside barrier that caused him to start bleeding before he retailed in the ring by tossing Rey out of the ring under the bottom ropes that caused him to hit the barber chair, set up at ringside, headfirst which knocked him silly for a bit while Punk got attended to. The match was stopped before Punk came aggressive at Mysterio after being patched up and focusing on Rey's head with various kids before Mysterio rebounded with a quick win resulting in Punk being forced to get his head shaved...with a little help from ""The Big Red Machine"" & some funny chants from the fans who wished for Rey to shave another part of Punk's body.
As a side note, if you don't enjoy the bickering between Lawler & Striker then I suggest you watch this match on mute since they kept going at each other throughout the match.
Over The Limit 10

vs. World Champion Jack Swagger vs. Big Show vs. C.M. Punk - With the names involved in this match, this was disappointing as they didn't do anything that stood out or was really memorable pass Jack Swagger executing a double suplex on both Mysterio & Punk. I'll give them credit in keeping this a fast paced match that never got slow while telling the story of everyone else teaming up together to take out the biggest threat in Big Show. The ""elephant in the room"" was the appearance of Kane looking for revenge for his brother Undertaker being attacked and he appeared as expected with his casket & judged who he thought was the guilty party before Mysterio was able to score the win to become World Champion for the second time in his career.
Fatal 4-Way 10

vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was Rey's return from his injury by Del Rio along with his debut on SmackDown since moving to SyFy & he was clearly out for revenge. We saw a more aggressive side from Mysterio than usual with him using objects around ringside such as a drop toehold into the steel steps, baseball sliding Del Rio's arm into the steel post, and stomping the arm on the steps. Rey was very dominate causing Del Rio to go after the previously injured arm to try to get somewhat of an advantage but he couldn't stop Rey who would eventually get his revenge.
As a side note, their first encounter is on the ""Best Of SmackDown 2009-2010"" DVD
""SmackDown"" Oct. 10

vs. Cody Rhodes - Cody was out for revenge here for no longer allowing himself to be called ""Dashing"" after the damage to his face while Rey wanted his own revenge for the attacks leading up to this event & for the record, the comic book outfit Rey has this year is Captain America. Cody used his mask as a weapon & targeted Rey's face with various headbutts & even going a springboard kick to the face onto Rey while also delivering impactful moves like Hardcore Holly's ""Alabama Slam"" & Davey Boy Smith's delayed vertical suplex from the top rope while able to keep breaking whatever momentum Rey kept trying to build throughout the match. Rey went after Cody's face as well including a head scissors to the outside with Cody's face smacking the ringside mat while later executing the 619 & a kick to Cody's exposed face. Both men went after each others weakness as Rey was able to remove Cody's mask & got payback for using it earlier while Rhodes was able to remove Rey's knee brace & had that play a factor in end.
WrestleMania XXVII

In the end, this was a nice collection of Mysterio as the interview segments were Mysterio got her personal with various subjects than he did on his previous two sets while he got a mix of some nice rare matches & career highlights with a very minimal amount of repeats from previous WWE collections (the John Morrison match & the HBK match if you have the Blu-Ray DVD as the ECW Juventud match was on a DVD release from the original ECW, not WWE). There are a few matches I would trade around for a better quality encounter but this was a release that satisfied me so I would recommend.",1312848000,,21430,4.541688244432937
8444349,5,B004W48KJ8,"Rey Mysterio has never disappointed me, and this video proves it. From his early years to 2009, he's unbelievably talented. If you're a true Rey fan, you need this dvd.",1312070400,,168,4.633333333333334
8444350,5,B004W48KJ8,"He is ""the human highlight reel"", ""the high flyer"", ""the ultimate underdog"", he is Rey Mysterio. This is a look into his life in and out of the ring, as we hear from the man himself over the next 3 discs. Matt Striker interviews Rey on a variety of topics then we cut to a match, its similar to the format of the Shawn Michaels, My Journey DVD.

Disc 1

-Rey talks about his childhood, his uncle Rey Mysterio and how he learned to wrestle at a very early age. Also how he had early gimmicks known as The Green Lizard then The Hummingbird and how he had to earn he name Rey Mysterio Jr. I also liked how he talked about his friend Konnan and how he helped put Mexican lucha libre on the map.

-10/28/95, ECW Hardcore TV: w/Konnan vs. La Parka & Psicosis: Good lucha tag team match with 4 of the greatest mexican wrestlers in modern history. This does appear to be somewhat clipped though the action they do show is good. Nice springboard into a hurricarana on Psicosis on the outside. There's some good high flying action by both Rey and Konnan just too bad its clipped. Rey and Konnan win after La Parka and Psicosis can't get back into the ring. 6/10.

-3/9/96, ECW Extreme Bash, 2 out of 3 Falls Match: vs. Juventud Guerrera: This match features at the time two of the youngest wrestlers from Mexico and with the 2 out of 3 falls stipulation it just makes it more worth watching. We get some good back and forth action then Juvi hits a full nelson suplex to take the first fall. Rey comes back hitting a nice hurricarana on Juvi, sending him to the floor and later hits a sit out powerbomb to even this match at 1 fall apiece. Juvi hits a springboard moonsault on Rey over the guardrail. Later Rey hits his own dive over the guardrail and the action then spills to outside where Juvi powerbombs Rey onto a car, then Rey comes back with a hurricarana off the hood of the car. Rey counters a splash mountain bomb from the top into a hurricarana to win the third fall. 9/10. Good post match with Rey powerbombing Juvi through a table on the outside.

-The ECW fans are discussed as Rey says the experience was unlike anything he'd ever been around. Also he says the fans drove him to work harder and about how Juventud was one of his best feuds in his career.

-11/3/96, WCW Pro: vs. Juventud Guerrera: I completely forgot about WCW Pro, but I'm glad they put this match on here, but don't blink or you'll miss it. Its good action but very short. Rey wins with a hurricarana off the top rope. 5/10.

-1/11/97, WCW Saturday Night: vs. Chavo Guerrero Jr.: This was when Chavo was younger and was actually allowed to wrestle unlike when he was in WWE. Its a decent match that showcases both men, though Chavo does slip while attempting a splash and Rey hits the springboard hurricarana for the win. 6/10.

-Eddie Guerrero is discussed and how Rey met him at an early age and how Eddie pushed him to his limits in their matches.

-9/8/97, WCW Monday Nitro: vs. Eddie Guerrero: These two were always magic in the ring and this match is no exception. Eddie works on Rey's back while Rey tries to come back hitting various head scissors and arm drags. Rey wins after hitting the springboard hurricarana for the win. 7/10.

-11/17/97, WCW Monday Nitro: vs. Chris Jericho: Besides Eddie I feel Rey's best matches were against Jericho as they just had that natural good guy/bad guy chemistry that worked so well. rey uses his quickness while Chris uses his strength advantage to wear down Mysterio, even hitting a gorilla press slam off the top rope. Rey comes back but his back has been worked over by Jericho so he can't put moves together. He does hit the springboard hurricarana out of nowhere for the win. 7/10.

-His first time meeting Jericho is talked about and how Chris thought at first that he was a little kid. Also how the designs of the masks have evolved over the years and what masks he admires.

-1/17/98, WCW Saturday Night: w/Super Calo & Hector Garza vs. Psychosis, La Parka & Silver King: Its 6 man lucha action and while short its a good match, I've always been a mark for La Parka as I've always found him entertaining. Garza seems to hurt his knee badly and Psychosis takes over on Calo, who comes back with a nice tilt a whirl backbreaker. We then get some good back and forth action from Parka and Rey then Rey hits a hurricarana on Parka for the win. 7/10.

-12/28/98, WCW Monday Nitro: w/Billy Kidman vs. Eddie Guerrero & Juventud Guerrera: This was during the infamous LWO storyline where Rey was forced to be a member of the group, obviously against his will, so there is some clear tension between all these men especially Eddie and Juvi. This is a good match, with some great back and forth action, Rey does get worked over a lot, epsecially taking a nasty snap powerbomb from Eddie. While there's good action it seems to be more about putting over a storyline than the match itself. Eddie hits the frog splash on Kidman for the win. 8/10.

-The closing of WCW is talked about and how it was great for him to be able to see his daughter being born. Also how he was able to wrestle for CMLL in mexico and that wrestling at Arena Mexico was a dream of his. He also went to work for Carlos Colon in Puerto Rico and that it was a good moment in his career. He was asked if he felt he would become such a huge star in WWE like he has and he said no.

-10/24/02, Smackdown, #1 Contenders Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship: w/Edge vs. Eddie & Chavo Guerrero: This was before the Los Guerreros gimmick but it was obvious from growing up together that these two had great chemistry as a team and Edge and Rey weren't far behind. This is a very good match where both teams get a chance to shine through various double team moves. Eddie and Chavo cut off the ring and wear down Rey. Once Edge gets the tag things pick up, Eddie hits a splash over the top and puts Chavo on Edge, but the ref is distracted by Eddie and Rey hits a leg drop on Chavo and Edge makes the cover for the win. 8/10.

-7/27/03, Vengeance, WWE Tag Team Championship Match: w/ Kidman vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team (Champions): This was just a classic tag team match, the momentum changed throughout, Benjamin and Hass use their obvious amateur wrestling edge to try to ground the high flyers while Rey and Kidman do a great job using their quickness to throw their opponents off their game. Benjamin hits a huge clothesline from the top on Rey for the pinfall to retain their titles. 8/10.

-Rey calls the previous match the greatest tag team match he's ever been in and how he and Kidman worked very well together and were even the Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions when WCW closed down. Surprisingly Kurt Angle is discussed and how Kurt was a great guy backstage but when it came to being in the ring you had to perform at his level. Also how hip-hop influenced the names of his moves.

-10/28/04, Smackdown: vs. Kurt Angle: These two have always had good matches as both have different styles but they work so well together. Early on Angle domintaes Rey and just seems to be toying with him, then Rey stomps on his foot and the action picks up. Nice belly to belly overhead suplex by Angle throwing Rey over the top rope. Kurt wears down Rey on the mat with body scissors and a sleephold. Rey comes back with a swinging DDT and he turns up the quickness. Jindrak and Reigns comes down to beat up Rey, RVD fights them off. Eddie interferes and hits a frog splash on Angle, then puts Rey on Kurt for the win. 8/10.

-12/30/04, Smackdown, WWE Tag Team Championship Match: w/ RVD (Champions) vs. Booker T & Eddie Guerrero: Before the match begins we get footage of WWE's trip to Iraq and how Eddie and Booker were both affected. We get some early counter wrestling from Rey and Eddie before Booker gets the tag, but Booker gets a high dropkick to the face from Rey. The action stays pretty fast and furious between all four men and Eddie and booker cut the ring off and work Rey over then after RVD gets the tag he gets worked over. The antics of Eddie using the tag belt come back to bite him as the ref catches him and Rey hits a roll-up for the win to retain the tag titles. 10/10.

Disc 2

-His influences are brought up maily Eddie Guerrero, how he was always there whenever he needed advice and how much he misses him even to this day. Their Wrestlemania 21 match is brought up and how his mask started to give him problems and thats why the match may have not been the classic it could've been. Also how being in Wrestlemania is always special for him.

-4/3/05, Wrestlemania 21 Tag Team Champion vs. Tag Team Champion: vs. Eddie Guerrero: This was about Eddie proving he could still compete at a main event level and that he wanted to prove he could beat Rey Mysterio. The before-mentioned mask issues are obvious but it actually is a good match, good counter wrestling and quickness by both men. Eddie nails a powerbomb for 2 then Rey hits a hurricarana for the win. 7/10.

-12/16/05, Smackdown, WWE Tag Team Championship Match: w/Batista (World Champion) vs. MNM: This was all about Rey and Batista winning one for Eddie (who died a month earlier), and while MNM got their spots in, the animal and Rey were too much. Rey hits the 619 on Melina and Mercury, Batista hits the Batista bomb on Mercury for the win as they captured the tag titles. 7/10.

-Batista is brought up, how their lifestyles do mesh well and how they got along very well in and out of the ring and how his winning the Royal Rumble was one for Eddie. Winning the World Title was a dream come true and all the sadness from Eddie's death melted away, even though he was with him in spirit.

-2/19/06, No Way Out, For Rey's #1 Contender's Spot at Wrestlemania 22, vs. Randy Orton: Randy had hammered Eddie in promos for weeks to draw Rey into this match. Its actually quite a good match as Rey took it to Orton early on for all Randy had said, but after that it turned into a good back and forth contest. Orton goes for the RKO but Rey counters with a dropkick, goes for the 619 and misses, Randy rolls him up and uses the ropes for the win. 7/10.

-AAA in Mexico honored Rey by inducting him into their hall of fame and that Rey felt very humbled cause thats where he got his start in wrestling. How important his heritage is and that when WWE tours Mexico that the fans never forget what he means to them. He talks about working with Chavo in his first WWE match and how it went all the way to a Falls Count Anywhere match where Rey took time off to get knee surgery.

-9/26/07, Summerslam: vs. Chavo Guerrero: This was Rey's return after almost a year off thanks to Chavo destroying his knee. All I'll say is the best part about this match was the entrance by Rey but he looked so weird with that silver bodypaint. It isn't a bad match, the crowd popped big for Rey's moves but it just seemed off, probably do to Rey being out of the ring for so long. rey hits the 619 and the splash off the top rope for the win. 5/10.

-10/28/07, Cyber Sunday, Stretcher Match: vs. Finlay: I forgot all about this match and its certainly a unique stipulation for these two. Early on Finaly works over Rey just beating him down with his own set of European offense. Rey comes back hitting a low, low baseball slide to even the odds. Rey rams the stretcher into Finlay then hits a modified 619 and a splash on Finlay who was on the strecther. Rey ends up pushing the stretcher over the white line to win the match. 7/10.

-His rivalry with Kane in '08 is brought up including Rey putting his mask on the line in their match at No Mercy and the importance of the mask and its connection with the fans. How he met Mil Mascaras who didn't wear his mask, when they were gonna do an interview for a magazine. He said he it was awesome to just chat with him.

-10/5/08, No Mercy, If Rey Loses He Must Unmask: vs. Kane: Rey tries to chop down Kane, while ""The Big Red Machine"" uses his power to just beat Rey into submission. He slams, stomps and works on Rey's back and head for a good few minutes, using a backbreaker and a chinlock. Rey hits a moonsault and his knee hits Kane in the head and targets Kane's knee knocking him down to his size. Kane goes for the chokeslam its countered and Rey hits an odd looking DDT for 2. Rey goes for a dive to the outside but Kane smashes a chair into his face, the ref calls for the DQ. 7/10.

-5/17/09, Judgement Day, Intercontinental Championship Match: vs. Chris Jericho: Like I said earlier besides Eddie, Rey always had some of his best matches with Jericho and this is no different. The crowd is a usual defiant Chicago crowd, as many fans are cheering for Jericho. There's some early high flying offense from Mysterio, before Chris takes over slamming Rey into the barricade and hits a nice springboard dropkick to knock Rey off the ring apron. The action stays at a good pace as both men counter each others moves on numerous occasions. Rey hits a 619 and then the splash off the top rope to retain his title. Great, great match. 10/10.

-We hear about Rey's friends in the music scene, especially about P.O.D. and how he even went to schoold with one of the band members. Also how he contributed lyrics to his current theme song. What his tattoos mean, even having his kid's names on his body and how his faith is his driving force in life.

-9/4/09, Smackdown, Intercontinental Championship Match: vs. John Morrison: Well this is the definition of athleticism as these two display a lot of quickness, high flying moves and Rey has the unusual task of competiting against a man who is just as skilled as he is. Morrison works on Rey's arm, who comes back hitting a tilt a whirl head scissors with 2 revolutions, nice move. This is the first time they've wrestled each other but you'd never know it from how well they work together. Morrison hits Starship Pain to become the I.C. champion. This is one classic match, especially for TV. 10/10.

Disc 3

-Rey talks about when he does and doesn't wear the mask, also how fans are respectful of asking if its ok to take a picture when he doesn't have the mask on.

-12/18/09, Smackdown, #1 Contender's Match for the World Heavyweight Championship: vs. Batista: These 2 former best friends face off in what I feel is one of the better little man/big man matches on TV in a while. Batista works over Rey's back and midsection with a back breaker and a slam into the ring post then just pounds him into the mat with a few slams. After Rey counters with a dropkick, he hits a bulldog and keeps the animal on the mat but not for the 3 count. Batista hits a spear but Rey kicks out, Rey then counters a spinebuster and rolls up Batista for the win. 8/10.

-1/29/10, Smackdown: vs. Shawn Michaels: This is a true dream match as these men only face each other one other time on the Eddie Guerrero tribute show in '05. Even at the stages of their careers they were at, these two do quite well at keeping a good past pace and Shawn even has a strength advantage over his opponent, which was rare in most of his matches. Shawn chops away at Rey's chest, while later Rey works on Shawn's knee with kicks and he even pulls out a unique leg submission on the knee. Shawn even uses the figure four to hurt Rey's knee. Rey hits the 619, goes for a dive but gets hit with Sweet Chin Music. Batista interferes and causes a DQ, Triple H comes down and we have a mini brawl between the 2, then the Undertaker appears in the ring, and chokeslams both men. 8/10 for the match.

-His list of injuries his discussed and how he has had to adapt his style to work around them, especially his ACL injury in his left knee and how his bicep injury in '08 caused him to miss Wrestlemania 24. He says Dr. James Andrews is a great doctor and knows him very well, cause of his injuries.

-1/31/10, Royal Rumble, World Heavyweight Championship Match: vs. The Undertaker (Champion): Maybe its just me but I didn't feel this was a good match-up, I mean both guys tried but this one didn't gel that good for me, mainly cause you knew Taker would win and Rey had no chance. Early on though Rey kicks away at Taker and his braced knee ends up busting open Taker's nose, which does seem to fuel the Deadman's rage. Taker wins after hitting a high impact Last Ride. 5/10.

-2/5/10, Smackdown, Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match: vs. Dolph Ziggler: These two had faced off in the past so they were able to counter each others moves better than most opponents. Rey was still showing the injuries from his match with Taker 5 days before. Ziggler did do a good job grounding Rey and almost had him beat on a few occasions even hitting a powerslam out of nowhere for 2. Rey hits a reverse roll-up for the win. 7/10.

-We hear about how Rey loved his ladder match with Eddie which was Rey's first in WWE and how the Elimination Chamber of this year and how they are two of his favorites in his career. He also says he tries to make as much time for his family as he can and that he loves riding motorcycles.

-5/23/10, Over The Limit, If Rey Loses He Must Join The Straight Edge Society, If Punk Loses He'll Have His Head Shaved: vs. CM Punk: These two had a good rivalry leading up to this match, Rey hits a head scissors launching Punk into the barricade which busted him open, Punk comes back throwing Rey under the bottom rope into the barber's chair at ring side. The referee and a doctor tries working on Punk's cut, which all through it Punk looks pretty upset about the delay. Punk comes out attacking Rey, slamming him into the barricade and just beating on Mysterio, which did get the crowd back into the match. After some great counter wrestling, Rey uses a crucifix pin to pick up the win. 9/10. Afterwards a mystery member of the S.E.S. and Luke Gallows and Serena make their appearance. Then Kane come down and destroys Gallows, the mystery man and Punk. Rey handcuffs Punk to the ring ropes and nails a 619, cuffs his other hand then uses the razor on Punk's head which is kinda graphic.

-Rey talks about his fanbase and how young people are affected by his character. Over the years he's realized how important and humbling it is to have someone look up to him and what he says to any of the fans he goes forehead to forehead with on his way to the ring. Also he says he hopes his children grow up and remember what he's taught them.

-6/20/10, Fatal 4-Way, 4 Way World Heavyweight Championship Match: vs. Big Show, CM Punk vs. Jack Swagger (Champion): Each man gets a chance to shine here, there's a good face-off between Show and Rey even with Show palming Mysterio's head and pulling him up to the ring apron. Swagger does have a good showing here as well, but I don't think WWE's office or the fans really bought into him as world champion. At one point in the match Kane comes down with a casket, trying to search for the Undertaker's attacker, he targets CM Punk, but Luke Gallows comes down and he and Punk run to the back. Rey hits a splash onto Swagger and makes the cover to win his second World title. 7/10.

-We hear about how Rey felt when he won the World title not once but twice and how it was an amazing feeling. He also talks about how he feels more lucha stars will cross into WWE because of his success.

-10/8/10, Smackdown: vs. Alberto Del Rio: This is Rey's first match back after Del Rio injured Mysterio's arm over a month ago. Rey was a lot more aggressive than usual, putting more emphasis on kicks and dives that he uses to really hurt Del Rio. Its actually a very well done match that re-established Rey and still built up Del Rio as an upcoming star. Rey knocks Del Rio into his ring announcer, hits the 619 and the top rope splash for the win. 7/10.

-4/3/11, Wrestlemania 27: vs. Cody Rhodes: Due to Rey's injuries halting enough decent face-offs before this, the build-up for this match seemed a little under-whelming, but Cody sure brought his A-game to this match. The Captain America outfit by Rey continues his tradition of comic book/movie inspired attire, but adds little to the bout. Cody pulls off some nice moves like a delayed veritcal suplex, and a jumping kick in the corner to Mysertio. Rey also pulls off some good moves after he takes off Cody's protective mask. The finish comes when Cody uses Rey's knee brace to knock him out then hits his Crossroads neckbreaker for the win. 8/10.

-Rey talks about what is next, say he always have his eyes on the future even outside of wrestling once his career is over. He also talks about wrestlers he wishes he could get in the ring with including Tiger Mask and Dynamite Kid from the past, Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin and future stars maybe even his son if he wanted to step into the ring.

-This is well worth getting, the interview segments are very insightful and the match selection is different from most as there are more TV matches and less PPV bouts, which makes this a good set to purchase.",1311206400,11,20912,4.3731650785475145
