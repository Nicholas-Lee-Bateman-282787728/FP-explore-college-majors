8098896,4,B000CFYAXQ,"I think it is a fantastic DVD for learning Taekkyon. You may have to rewind the DVD a lot, but in the west we seem to have a need for constant written instructions and explanations on which way we should move or what stance we should use. Eastern martial arts is based more on learning through physical practice. You can't understand the true feeling of a martial art by reading a critical manual, you need to get physically involved (granted, written theory is also important). It will be difficult at first, but over a long time of practice, you will get used to the speed of the DVD, all it takes is practice. It's not the same as being taught by Grandmaster Lee Yong Bok in the flesh, but it's a start. I recommend this DVD to anyone who would like to learn or know more about Taekkyon.",1344816000,2,790,4.344594594594595
8098897,4,B000CFYAXQ,"I've been interesting in learning Taekkyon for a while now; however, the only place to learn Taekkyon is Folk Village, Korea, and most of the sites with in-depth explanations on Taekkyon are in Korean!  I searched Taekkyon on Amazon and there were only 6 items Taekkyon related!

Taekkyon has been practiced in the late B.C./early A.D.s and continued to thrive into the second millenium.  But due to Japanese occupation of Korea in the 1900s Taekkyon almost vanished completely!  Due to one old man who practiced Taekkyon as a boy it has been reborn in Korea but is still fairly new in this day and age.

That being said this is some of the only information available in the United States regarding Taekkyon.

Taekkyon isn't really taught in this DVD.  The shots show a group of Taekkyon practitioners going through all (or most of the basic) techniques of the style.  The korean names are given but translations of what the techniques are called in english are not.  There is no explanation on how to perform the techniques and if you wish to learn be expecting to rewind about 200 times for each technique.  Also the techniques shown are very brief usually only spending half a minute to a minute per move.  Because there is a lot going on behind the footwork and the rhythmn you would be hard-pressed to learn this on your own without prior dancing/music experience.

This DVD has the most in-depth history of Taekkyon that I could find anywhere.  However, there is no explaination whatsoever on how to perform the forms and the interview with Grandmaster Lee Yong Bok was very brief.  But what can you expect with only 75 minutes of running time?  Overall they squish a whole lot of information into such a short time.  They pretty much cover all there is to know about Taekkyon but in a compressed not-so-great version.  Don't expect to learn the style from this DVD though because the instruction is non-existent.  If you're someone interested in Taekkyon then you NEED THIS DVD!  It is the greatest source of information you can get on the subject in english.",1254096000,4,2066,4.7366946778711485
