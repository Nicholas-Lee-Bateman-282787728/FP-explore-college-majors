8540777,1,B009EU0YPS,Wish i knew it wouldn't play on US Blue Ray before I before I bought it! Amazon - real rubbish - pleased you now tell people but didn't help me - will you take it back?,1431993600,,168,3.6944444444444446
8540778,5,B009EU0YPS,The day that man dies is the day I curse nature. I wish he was my long-lost grandfather and would read me stories as I fall asleep.,1423180800,,131,3.888888888888889
8540779,1,B009EU0YPS,"THIS FILM WILL NOT PLAY ON AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS!@!!!  IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE WHERE THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAILS ARE PUT, NAMELY, PRICE, BLUE-RAY, ETC., THERE IS NOTHING, AND I MEAN NOTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS FILM WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE PLAYED EXCEPT ON A FOREIGN TYPE RECEIVER.

Be very careful to look at the DETAILS and if it says REGION 2, don't buy it unless you want to go to the trouble of purchasing a separate REGION 2 receiver, disconnect your regular VCR player and connected a new receiver to watch these films.  I am a David Attenboreough fan and have purchased all of his films, but have run into this problem for the second time.  The Lives of Plants 3D is another film that shouldn't be advsertised in the U.S. unless it says right on the top of the ad that it is a REGION 2 film and needs a special receiver which generally speaking, Americans do not have.",1418342400,,899,4.333333333333333

8540781,1,B009EU0YPS,The format did not work on American DVD player and therefore I had to return it.  This is very disappointing.  The other BBC nature DVDs from Amazon did work.  Amazon should investigate this and fix it.,1378252800,2,202,4.555555555555555

His narration is the best!

8540783,5,B009EU0YPS,Of course it is excellent. A wonderful way to gain insight on both the man and his incredible influence with the nature documentary development.,1362528000,6,144,5.041666666666667
