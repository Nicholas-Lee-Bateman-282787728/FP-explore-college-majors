8247404,4,B0012RD3ZY,"Kuu is enrolled in a new school. She learns that many of the students have powers to materialized weapons similar to mecha. There are fights occurring all over the place. A young man named Kyoshiro transfers in and bears a strong resemblance to a man that she sees in her dreams. After saving her from a battle they begin to have a strong relationship.

This anime reminded me a lot of My-Hime. It has a very similar story line. The animation in this series is way better though. It's done very beautifully. All the way from the character designs, to the coloration and backgrounds. Like My-Hime it is a very touching and emotional story. The ending is especially tearful. My only complaint about this series is the length. It's amazing that they were able to fit so much emotion into a short series, but if it had been longer it may have bordered on epic. I don't like the word ""epic"" because it's used way too much, but this story would have been if it had been a bit more in depth. That being said Shattered Angels is a really good anime at a great price!",1354924800,,1058,4.3979591836734695
8247405,4,B0012RD3ZY,"Fans of other Kaishaku series, such as Kannazuki no Miko and Steel Angel Kurumi are going to want to see this series. This is a mashup of other Kaishaku worlds, stuck into a blender and pourned back out in similar molds. Many characters and types from previous series are rehashed, but in a way that does not lessen the enjoyment.

The same fetishes as always are involved - maids, catgirls, Yuri, etc.

It's a must-see for Kaishaku fans.",1245888000,,438,4.602564102564102
