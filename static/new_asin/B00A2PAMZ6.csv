8546318,3,B00A2PAMZ6,"The pamphlet included with the BluRay makes an elaborate point on why Maurice Maeterinck, the librettist, uses old fairy tales to convey his message. So why have a production that is as far away from a fairy tale as possible? This modern and down-to-earth production has some good features and ideas, but seems to me it misses the whole point of the story.  In essence it is related to the liberation of women, and how Ariane stands up to the oppressor, but fails miserably in convincing the other wives of the freedom outside.  The portraying of the other wives as mentally sick not only misses the point, but betrays the essential message.
Charbonnet as Ariane is a mismatch.  It is a very difficult character to play, since it needs to convert from an innocent bride to an assertive woman. Her singing is also not convincing and sometimes out of tune, or at least it sounds like that.
On the other hand, the opera is interesting and some of the music is beautiful and suggestive. The prelude to Act III stands by itself. With a different production I would have enjoyed the opera much more.  I don't know of any other DVD or BluRay recording, so I will have to stay with this one until another one is produced.  The opera is worth it.",1369440000,3,1237,4.5291479820627805
8546319,3,B00A2PAMZ6,"I was totally unfamiliar with this composer or this opera. But in my zeal to uncover new operas, I watched this release from Opera Barcelona.

Conclusion- I didn't like the opera at all, but I thought the production was pretty good.

Paul Dukas (1865-1935) is a little known French composer, who made his musical bones more as a critic and teacher than composer. This is his only opera, and it is not frequently performed,especially outside France. This performance though was in Barcelona.

The opera deals with the Bluebeard legend, and the myth of his 6 wives, the five previous to the present one, Ariane, having disappeared. She, having just married him, is given 6 keys but warned to stay away from the seventh door. She doesn't, and it leads to the ""dungeon"" where she encounters the other wives very much alive, though imprisoned. She frees them, and after the peasants have revolted and attacked Bluebeard (off stage), the wives fuss over him.

The story is mildly interesting, but I found the music almost unlistenable. It is almost entirely ""dialogue"" rather than arias. The singing is highly arched, with Ariane (Jeanne-Michele Charbonnet) practically shrieking in some parts. It wasn't atonal- but it wasn't enjoyable, either. Orchestrally, the music was much more interesting, especially the prelude to Act 3.

Apparently, Dukas was much influenced by Debussey, but, for me, I heard much more of a Wagner influence (which is not a bad thing), especially in the orchestration.

Ms. Charbonnet has received criticism in other reviews for her singing, and I didn't like it either. But,I think the fault here lies three ways- on the composer (for a bad score), on the producer for choosing a singer for whom the tessitura of the part is out of her comfort range, and Ms. Charbonnet for taking the part and doing a poor job with it.

Although, I didn't like the opera, I thought the stage production was fairly effective. It is NOT the traditional Bluebeard setting of a castle, etc. Instead, it is set in a modern suburban home in a leafy area. No dungeon, obviously, but the floor opened up to the basement below. I thought it all worked fairly well.

As for the technical dvd stuff, they were all excellent- video, camera work, sound, lighting, subtitles, etc.

So, was disappointed in this. I won't go see it on stage (not likely anyway), and probably won't watch this again. But, still I do love to try new things, even if they aren't all winners.",1364342400,2,2461,4.826603325415677
8546320,4,B00A2PAMZ6,"Ariane was much admired by some of the most important composers of our time, yet its greatness is not too apparent on a single viewing.  There is much use of the whole tone scale and thus some melodies do not stick in your mind on first hearing.  The plot which outlines the tribulations of women obsessed by an attraction to an  unsuitable male and one woman's unsuccessful  attempt to free them from this bondage and only partial success in freeing herself is not particularly exciting.  Yet the opera has its moments and requires repeated listening.",1364169600,4,552,4.768421052631579
8546321,3,B00A2PAMZ6,"This is a wistfully beautiful score, an emotionally-charged, quasi-Wagnerian opera, with scents of Massenet and Faure, and a nod to Debussy. It is set to the Bluebeard story, from the play by symbolist writer Maurice Maeterlinck. He wrote the story with an idea for an opera, and Grieg in mind for the composer. Grieg lost interest and Maeterlinck sought out Dukas who took up the mantle.

It has a good pedigree. Toscanini gave its U.S. premiere with the Metropolitan Opera in 1911 and it has been recorded several times in audio. This is its first performance on DVD; it's a mystery why it hasn't been filmed before. Dukas is far more than the popular Sorcerer's Apprentice's. His Symphony and the ballet La Peri are first-rate French romantic works and Ariane et Barbe-blue grips the listener with its searing beauty.

This 2011 performance from Barcelona has some important strengths. The orchestra is a major component of the work and conductor Stephane Deneve brings sweep, sensitivity and color to the music, with the Liceu Orchestra in fine fettle. Unfortunately, as much as the sounds from the pit are lovely, they cannot fully overcome lead singer Jeanne-Michele Charbonnet and director Claus Guth. Charbonnet, an American soprano, has a warm middle and lower register and is a sensitive actress. She is onstage seemingly the entire almost two-hour opera, and unfortunately, the unsteadiness and strain in her upper register in louder passages is too often and detrimentally on display. That's especially so in the first scene of act three where I began to dread it every time she began to sing.(Charbonnet has also recorded the role of Judith in Bartok's version of Bluebeard's Castle, with the BBC Symphony in 2005, although it seems currently unavailable).

While Ariane is easily the major figure onstage, the nurse who accompanies her has the next biggest role and thankfully is sung with security and color by Patricia Bardon. Jose van Dam's Bluebeard is onstage in each act but only briefly and sings only a little in the first act.

Guth has made his mark with controversial and - although I may be in the minority - compelling, updated stagings of the Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cosi fan tutte. Here he has also modernized the scene but to less convincing results. Dukas' castle has turned into a house which looks sterile and institutional on the inside, where almost all the action takes place. The opera mentions peasants, drawbridges, pitchforks, moats and carriages, and none of these are seen. His modernized view makes these images seem incongruous. Guth also plays fast and loose with some of the stage directions.

His offstage use, however, of the Peter Grimes-like vindictive community (here peasant) choir is a nice element which emphasizes the wives and propels the imagination. Guth also makes some good use of light, shade and darkness and has some interesting video backdrops which help bring some atmosphere to the proceedings. He needed more of these creative touches. The staging isn't ""Eurotrash."" It's not insulting. It's just pretty lifeless and insipid. This beautiful score deserves better.

The costumes, simple white dresses for Ariane and Bluebeard's five wives, also seem spartan, incompatible with Maeterlinck's images from another era, although the actresses do their most to engage the viewer, neurotic as they are. Dukas' score has much mystery and magic. What we see on screen and hear from Charbonnet has far too little.",1363824000,9,3483,5.101754385964912
8546322,1,B00A2PAMZ6,"Yet another rarely-staged opera gets wretchedly misrepresented/Eurotrashed in its 1st commercial DVD release.

Claus Guth's ""updated"" staging obsessively ignores the libretto, with nearly every action & object referred to in the text nowhere to be seen.

Making this misguided production even more appalling is the ghastly-looking-&-sounding Jeanne-Michele Charbonnet, dominating every scene as Ariane, her hideous wobble & shrill voice made even uglier by her inability to sing more than 1 out of every 10 notes at the correct pitch.

I forced myself to sit though the entire mess this 1 time, but never again.  Consider yourselves warned.",1362873600,15,640,5.56701030927835
8546323,5,B00A2PAMZ6,"There are many meanings and cautionary messages that can be drawn from the fairytales of Charles Perrault, but 'Bluebeard' - the tale of an aristocratic serial killer who murders his wives - is surely one of the most gruesome and darkly enigmatic. Even more so in Ariane et Barbe-bleue, the version penned by the Symbolist Belgian dramatist Maurice Maeterlinck, the author of Pellas et Mlisande, who himself adapted the work - again practically intact - as a libretto for the French composer Paul Dukas. Comparisons with Debussy's opera - written only five years previously in 1902 - are inevitable, but if the musical influences that Dukas draws from are more evident and less distinctive than Debussy, the turn of the 20th century psychological exploration of Maeterlinck's characters is no less endlessly fascinating and deeply compelling.

Although it is rather more emphatic in highlighting the specifics of the drama and the words than Debussy, Dukas' score also hints at those other meanings and ambiguities. The references to Debussy's impressionism may be apparent - just as Maeterlinck uses characters from his other works (like Mlisande) for Bluebeard's wives - but Dukas more obviously draws from Wagner and particularly Strauss in Salome (in the scoring of the dark undercurrents in the relationship between Salome and Jochanaan) for more explicit, direct expression. It's a fascinating and rich musical exploration by Dukas in his only opera work, powerful, beautiful and modern, possibly even more influential than Debussy's unique and inimitable opera, with the associations and female psychology explored here evidently influential on Strauss and Hofmannstahl's fairytale-like Die Frau ohne Schatten and its extraordinary use of female voices is matched only by Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmlites.

Considering the psychological nature of the work and the necessity of allowing its openness, ambiguity and symbolism to speak for itself, it's perhaps not surprising that director Claus Guth doesn't follow the libretto too literally. He avoids what would now be considered clichd imagery in the opening scene of mobs of angry townspeople bearing pitchforks and firebrands, as the latest young bride seems to go willingly to her doom in Bluebeard's castle. The castle here is nothing more than a modern suburban residence, but it's what it represents that is important, and evidently the house is Bluebeard himself and it's the uncomfortable and dangerous nature of the masculinity that Ariane examines, challenges and delves into, not only opening doors, but breaking through the surface of the floor to the horrors that lie underneath. The set design works well in this respect, keeping the visuals clean, simple and symbolic, allowing the singers the necessary space to express the layers of meaning that lie within Maeterlinck's libretto and Dukas' seething score.

Much of the power of the work is indeed delivered through the scoring for powerful mezzo-soprano and contralto female voices and this cast proves to be highly effective in conveying its force. Ariane requires a strong Wagnerian soprano to express her character's inner strength of personality and purposefulness and Jeanne-Michle Charbonnet's rich tone is commanding and persuasive, yet sensitive to the shimmering suggestion of the score. She is well supported by an equally strong and wonderfully measured Patricia Bardon as the nurse, but all of the female cast here are impressive here as the other wives, although Gemma Coma-Alabert's fiery Slysette is the only one with a significant role. As the male at the centre of the work, Bluebeard is evidently an important role in Ariane et Barbe-bleue, even if the singing is limited to only a few lines. Jos van Dam - who has mostly retired from big-scale stage productions - is no longer in possession of a voice as commanding as it once was, but there's consequently a vulnerability as well as a necessary strength of personality here that puts an interesting spin on his Barbe-bleue.

This is an extremely rare work but one that deserves to be better known, and - appearing for the first time on either DVD or Blu-ray - this is a marvellous production of a fascinating work, emphatically delivered with force and sensitivity by the orchestra of the Liceu under Stphane Denve. The quality of the Blu-ray's HD image and high resolution sound mixes ensures that the performance is given the best possible presentation. I personally found the surround DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mix a little too open, and that it suited the more direct stereo PCM mix better, with the full detail of the orchestration clearer through headphones. Other than a Cast Gallery, there are no extra features on the disc, but the booklet contains a good essay by Gavin Plumley, and there's a full, detailed synopsis. The BD is all-region compatible with subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Catalan, Japanese and Korean.",1359849600,17,4945,5.247787610619469
