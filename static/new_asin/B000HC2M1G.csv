2633548,4,B000HC2M1G,"FIXING FRANK is somewhat of a rarity these days - a film well made form script to production that puts a hot topic on the table and challenges the viewer to think, all the while providing a very entertaining movie experience.  The work began as a play by Ken Hayes who also adapted his play for the screen and while the 'opening up' of a stage play on the cinematic format is successful, in many way the dialogue feels very theatrical and the method of production stagy.  That fact may annoy some viewers: for this viewer it worked, allowing us to here the superb script delivered in its entirety without frosting it with unnecessary visuals.

Credit director Michael Selditch for the creative approach to this filmed play. He keeps the story moving and integrated and draws exceptionally fine performances from his superb cast.  In essence this is a three person film - two apposing therapists who are at opposite poles of dealing with the concept that being gay is an immutable inherited trait versus the possibility that with therapy the gay behavior can be changed to heterosexual behavior if the patient desires that 'change'.

Frank (Andrew Elvis Miller), a writer who is in the process of exposing a therapist Dr. Aspey (Dan Butler) who claims he can 'cure' gay men - at least according to Frank's lover Dr. Baldwin (Paul Provenza), an activist gay therapist.  Frank, coached by Baldwin,  has sessions with Aspey with the idea of trapping him into revealing his 'damage' to gay patients who have complained to Baldwin of Aspey's techniques.  But what Frank discovers is a that Aspey deals with choices and changes on a strictly therapeutic angle, not basing claims for 'cures'  for a lifestyle he does not condemn.  In the process of the 'therapy' sessions, Frank grows into his own identity - a fact that alters his relationship with Baldwin and opens many closed doors of thought for all three characters - and us.

The actors are all excellent: one wonders if they played these roles on the stage.  The intermingling of the sessions with conversations outside of sessions is additive and while many may object to the theatrical use of placing all three actors on the screen simultaneously when a 'session; is in progress, the format works well in allowing the script to be heard and maintain its punch.  This is a thinkers' movie, the concepts are controversial and may find some viewers anger points, but as a film it works exceptionally well.

2633549,4,B000HC2M1G,"Perhaps it might be possible to review a film without revealing every detail and interjecting one's own interpretation of it.

This film chronicles the struggle between two opposing therapists who view each other as working at cross-purposes, to state it mildly.  In order to ""expose"" the other, one therapist sends in his male lover to pose as someone interested in being converted to a heterosexual, but nothing goes as planned and the damage to everyone is considerable.

My expectations for this film were low, given the viewer ratings, but it is more interesting and more thought-provoking than most people probably give it credit for.  It's not light, it's not funny, and it's primarily about gay people struggling with their beliefs and examining their relationships.  The ""villain,"" in this film is pretty sympathetic, perhaps more sympathetic than the ""super-gay"" man that is supposed to be saving everyone.  Indeed, there is nobody here without a dark steak, and nobody here without some redeeming qualities.

I also appreciated the commentary/testimony that occurs occasionally during the film.  It explains the characters' points of view and makes more sense as the film continues.  The dialog in this film is fascinating overall and I found myself rewinding to hear the banter a second time.

I didn't like the squeaky and unsatisfying ending and I didn't find it believable or logical, but the rest is really quite intelligent and thoughtful.  If you're in the mood for something more substantive than another frothy romantic comedy, then this might be intriguing.",1161561600,6,1578,5.222222222222222

8138231,5,B000HC2M1G,"Fixing Frank had been in my rental queue for a while. I kept pushing it down because of its mediocre reviews, but finally it was the best one left, and it came today. I watched the first third, then I skipped to the end to see how it ended, because I hate surprises. I was so put off by the ending that I almost returned the DVD right away, but I figured I might as well watch it anyway. I'm glad I did.

All the even slightly negative reviews are wrong, whatever their particular criticisms are. This is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time, and I've seen lots of good ones in the past year. Fixing Frank is smart, riveting, moving, completely believable, beautifully balanced both ideologically and emotionally, brutal and lyrical at the same time, with perfect performances from all three principal actors. It took longer for one character's humanity to show through, but it was well worth the wait.

I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. I'm going to watch it again before sending it back, and I just ordered a copy of my own.",1260576000,3,1046,4.471204188481676
8138232,3,B000HC2M1G,"This was not exactly what I expected, but although disappointed, I did find the film intriging. Only three actors in the entire film which was a rather different concept, and through the plot I was wondering to myself ""Where is this leading and just what are they trying to promote in this movie""? I still can't tell you for certain what their aim was as it is entirely possible to walk away with two different opinions of what message the writer was trying to get across. Very good acting and very thought provoking. Regardless of which side of the issue at hand you support, the decision remains yours at the end, as neither side really ever won the argument.

Unusual, entertaining, but a great let down overall as the description of the film really wasn't very accurate. I didn't hate the film, but I really wouldn't recommend it either. It's one of those films that if you see it fine, if not, you're really not missing anything. I am very neutral on this one.",1185062400,,965,4.545977011494253
8138233,4,B000HC2M1G,"If the topic of reparative therapy is of interest to you, this movie offers an inside view to the methods of ""questioning self"" no matter what your preference. If you seek entertainment skip Fixing Frank. The film requires your full attention from the start and boldly challenges ethics of the psychology profession as well as the gay agenda. Who wins at the end of this theatrical chess game? Depending upon the circle of friends you keep the answer is worth exploring especially if some friends are afraid to speak.",1169337600,3,517,4.820224719101123
8138234,4,B000HC2M1G,"This was an excellent film.  However, you'll need to get through the first 30 minutes before it starts grabbing you.  For me, I found myself wandering through the first part of the film wondering exactly where this story was headed.

The story just starts, and you need to pay careful attention to understand the relationship between the 3 characters.  All 3 stars (Dan Butler, Andrew Elvis Miller, Paul Provenza) are excellent in their roles!  At moments, Butler and Miller capture the screen.

At first, I did NOT like some of the filming techniques, at all!  I got use to it, maybe half way through the film.  This is a personal taste, and you'll either like the style, or hate it.  Rather then lay out the premise of the film in the beginning, the viewer must watch and learn to understand how the 3 characters develop.  The film uses flash-forward sequences, which at times were annoying.

Storyline: Dr Apsey (Butler) plays a psychologist who is believed by many to convert gay man to straight.  ""Frank"", for whom the film is titled, is setup by his boyfriend, Dr Baldwin, to play a patient who desires to be ""fixed"" (i.e. made straight).  Frank is a writer, and intends to tell the story. About a 1/3 of the way into the film, things take a dramatically different direction.  At this point, only each individual watching the film can determine what they consider to be ""right or wrong"".

You should try and watch the film with friends, and be prepared for a lively discussion afterwards.  Personally, no one could convert me to be someone other then who I am.  But the film raises questions, that MAY not be easy for everyone to answer.

There are a few exceptional portions of the film, and the second half is clearly better then the first.  The film is occasionally slow, mostly in the beginning.  You'll need to watch it carefully to stay focused on the story.  The end result is an intense film that deals with the issue of ""conversion therapy"".  Again, I already have my personal opinions, but you may find yourself leaning to both sides of the fence after watching ""Fixing Frank"".",1167091200,6,2093,4.66120218579235
8138235,5,B000HC2M1G,"I found the first part of this movie difficult going because it is so obviously a filmed play. Talk, talk, talk. That's all. And more talking. However, by the end of the movie I became very invested in the characters and the story. If you enjoy language, this movie is for you. Also, the performances by Dan Butler and Andrew Elvis Miller are extraordinary. I could have watched them forever.",1162425600,12,392,4.614285714285714
