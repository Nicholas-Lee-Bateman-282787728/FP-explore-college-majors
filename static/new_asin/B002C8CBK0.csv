Vinay Pathak:: Seriously this guy needs no intros. He is just spot-on. Others do their part as per the demands.
Going by the demands of the content, the movie is aptly based in London and the spirit is very well captured. Cinematography is of high standards and very much comparable to the likes of stalwarts viz. P C Sreeram/ Ravi Chandran.
The screenplay is written and executed extremely well ensuring it binds the viewers at all times.
The plot could have been completely linear. Jumping back and forth didn't seem quite right. Also the opening credits could have been more bland as opposed to the existing sci-fi touch.
Special mention is deserved for the director Parvati Balagopalan who handles the reigns quite efficiently.

Finally at the risk of being repetitive, should have been given more publicity - at the bare minimum it would fared better at the box-office in UK.",1302220800,,959,4.847560975609756
