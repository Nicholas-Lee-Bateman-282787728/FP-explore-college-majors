7905535,4,B000009N2E,"From the director of <I>Boat People<i> and <I>Song of Exile<i> (who just won the Hong Kong Academy Award in 2000), this film definitely shows the serious (but interesting) side of Hong Kong's  independent filmmaking.  The film examines the cultural differences between  East and West by focusing on a grandfather who looks after his 12-yr-old  American Grandson.  Very insightful and humorously done!  Ann Hui herself,  a director who separated from her family in mainland China and struggled to  establish her career in Hong Kong, understands cultural differences.  I  would not say that this film is Ann Hui's best, but her better ones are not  yet availiable in North America.",961459200,,679,5.194444444444445
