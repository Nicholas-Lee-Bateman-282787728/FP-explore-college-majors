8154178,5,B000K2V7IW,"I wondered about the quality, but even a 320x240 rip to mpg file shows very well. We have watched all H.C. movies, and all of Season one plus 4 of Season 2 episodes. I looked around, several places and this was the best price. 4 DVDS, you can't go wrong...We look forward to seeing the rest of these.

Will update when finished.",1395705600,,328,4.290322580645161
8154179,5,B000K2V7IW,This compilation showcases Hopalong Cassidy and his sidekicks providing humor and excitement in the old West.

8154181,5,B000K2V7IW,Hoppy was such a character from the days of classic western TV (and movie) viewing.  To relive that thrill you have to have this Hopalong Cassidy DVD set.  Pour yourself a glass of Sasparilla (As Hoppy used to do) and enjoy the show>,1286755200,2,233,4.395348837209302
8154182,5,B000K2V7IW,"This collection is just, well, plain wonderful! William Boyd is older, of course, actually nearing the end of the fabulous Hoppy saga (his interpretation of it), but these are still wonderful in every way. The stories are fine, the characters authentic, the scenery excellent. Enough just hasn't been said about what a magnificent horse Topper really was! Look at that tail, that majestic gait! What a beautiful horse! And Hoppy, well, what youngster didn't want to know someone like that? He was and still is a true mentor thanks to the timelessness of film.

8154183,5,B000K2V7IW,The re mastering of William Boyd's tv series is excellent. Although not as agile as in the movie series he still commands an authority figure. Sometimes the action is slow in some episodes and Edgar Buchanan can sometimes go over the top. However the quality of the prints is excellent and makes the viewing doubly enjoyable. A must for Hoppy fans.,1179014400,10,348,4.721311475409836
