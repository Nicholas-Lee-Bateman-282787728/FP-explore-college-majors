It is a great ranch album that commurates the way the ranches used to be and some still are today if you are invovled in the ranching community at all. My family was very happy with this video as well as was i, i wish there were more videos out there for sale like this one.",1313193600,,334,4.0
8621672,5,6302374480,"I've had this since 1990 and we love watching it.  It is wonderfully documented, like a national geographic special, with original music and real ranch cowboys and their wives and children.  Excellent for family viewing, school reports, show and tell.  Great gift for a child who loves to watch other children riding horses and roping and branding in real life, humbly and authentically, helping their parents.  Also, great talk-overs, interviews by the real cowboys and their families.  From winter, spring, summer, and fall, every aspect of working cow ranch in New Mexico.",1007596800,2,575,5.206521739130435
