4498898,2,B004YCKJVA,"This DVD has a low price but the video quality was disappointing. Mosquito noise, and block noise in fast motion scenes are noticeable.

A thing that surprised me was that the four movies were stored on one SINGLE-layer (not dual-layer) double-sided DVD. In addition to the above shortcoming, not all of the 4.7 GB space available on each side of the DVD was utilized, unnecessarily lowering video quality.

Side 1:
Pokemon - 4Ever (in 16:9 AR)
Pokemon - Heroes The Movie (in 4:3 AR)
3.11 GB

Side 2:
Pokemon - Jirachi Wish Maker (in 4:3 AR)
Pokemon - Destiny Deoxys (in 16:9 AR)
3.66 GB

And there are no subtitles nor closed captions nor extras at all. And the menus are very simple and plain.

Price aside, this DVD is a disappointment. There are no subtitles. If you are going to watch it on a big screen TV, be prepared for not-so-good video quality.",1314921600,22,855,4.525974025974026

4498904,4,B004YCKJVA,Great set with good quality picture. Price point is excellent due to getting 4 movies for the price of one. The only unfortunate thing is that all 4 of the movies do not come with the pikachu shorts that typically accompany each movie. Also - they are not in the correct chronological order on the title menu.,1399075200,,309,4.43859649122807

4498913,5,B004YCKJVA,"Do you know how lucky I am? No. No you don't.

I've been using gift cards to buy my animes, and I had some money left over from my last purchase. I was just a FEW CENTS away from being able to get this because it had cost 2 dollars something cents plus 3.99 shipping, but it dropped in price to .50 cents plus 3.99 shipping and I was able to afford four Pokemon movies for such an amazingly cheap price!! I'm positively thrilled. I hope that nothing was wrong with it or something... if it was sold for so cheap, you can't help but be paranoid, you know?

EDIT: The disk seems okay, and the coverart is awesome but MAN! This dvd was obviously not kept well. You have no idea how dirty it was! I thought it was messed up beyond repair!! I won't rate this any lower thoguh (there should seriosuly be two ratings on amazon: one for the product when it was recieved, and one for giving many stars to the show you love on dvds). Many people end up rating something super low because even thoguh they loved the series, the product they got was bad. That's unfair, don't you think?",1376524800,,1074,4.20873786407767

4498917,4,B004YCKJVA,"This a pretty decent set of movies. I like 3 of them. The ones that are good are Jirachi Wish Maker, 4ever and, Heros. If you read the review I wrote on Destiny Deoxys you will know why. The best movie is Jirachi Wish Maker because of the really good story. The 2nd best moie is Heros because of some of my favorite pokemon (Latios and Latias) are in the movie.",1375574400,,361,4.098591549295775
4498918,5,B004YCKJVA,"This is a wonderful bundle that I would recommend to any Pokmon fan. This is a two-sided disc so extra care must be taken when handling this disc or you could damage the disc. Think of this as a mini laserdisc.

Side A
Pokmon 4Ever/Pokmon Heroes

Side B
Pokmon Destiny Deoxys/Pokmon Jirachi Wish Maker

Now about the flaws. It depends on your DVD player. I tried this on an Xbox 360 S set to 1080p via HDMI. The results were mixed. Side A had issues playing in 1080p. In Pokmon Heroes, my favorite Pokmon movie, some of the colors were off. For example, Pikachu's thunderbolt was a yellow-green instead of yellow. There were black lines going through all moving objects. There is even some pixilation. There was some shaking the video. Pokmon 4Ever had the same issues. Side B doesn't seem to have the issues that plague Side A. Destiny Deoxys plays fine, as does Jirachi Wish Maker. I was about to give up on this set when I tried this disc in my JVC XV-511 DVD player hooked up through Component video at 480i. The results were much better. All four movies looked much better and the colors were perfect. Those black lines were gone. The shaky video on Side A was only slightly and only appeared in Pokmon 4Ever for a little bit. Side B had no issues at all. These are the only flaws that I can find. Other reviews on Amazon complained about the lack of disc artwork. Those people don't understand that you can't put artwork on a double-sided disc because the data is on both sides. If you covered up that data, the laser cannot read that data. If you don't mind those minor flaws, then get this collection. If you want the best quality, buy the movies separately. Overall, it is a great bundle and if you like these movies, I strongly recommend this collector's set!

UPDATE:
I tried this set on my Panasonic DVD/VCR Combo unit(I don't know what the model is) hooked up via Component video. Everything works perfectly. The movies look the way they should. The only problem is that it is a little fuzzy on my HDTV, but for a 480i resolution, that's normal. A simple fix for that is a Component Video to HDMI converter. I now firmly believe that the video quality depends on your DVD player.",1373846400,,2192,4.4725
4498919,5,B004YCKJVA,"Being a fan of the series, I have been looking for all four of these movies.  To get them all in one is awesome!",1373846400,,112,3.6666666666666665

4498922,5,B004YCKJVA,Pokemon Is a series that is widely known and so for that reason its products get quite expensive. This dvd contained four of the movies which is a great deal. Also it shipped really fast which makes me happy since I buy a lot of products off of Amazon.,1370563200,,252,4.163265306122449
4498923,5,B004YCKJVA,The set was great for a gift for my niece.  She loved it and also the fact that it contained more than one episode/movie.,1368748800,,121,4.041666666666667
4498924,5,B004YCKJVA,This was actually a really good buy. Yes it doesn't have any special features and yes there are 2 on one side and 2 on the other side but it was still really good! Either way this is a great buy to get 4 movies for this price!,1368662400,,226,3.7291666666666665
4498925,4,B004YCKJVA,its great for the most parts its everything as advertised four movies in one package. the only problem is that its all on one disk and its a double sided disk and there's no right way to handle it with out smugging it especially when putting it away in its case. aside from the form of data storage it is a great purchase for what i paid for,1368230400,,341,4.029411764705882

4498927,4,B004YCKJVA,"As with all Pokemon movies there are morals and attention paid to honesty and friendship. Also there is an environmental element to these two movies I didn't mind my son being exposed to, all things considered. I love Pokemon.",1365724800,,226,4.82051282051282
4498928,5,B004YCKJVA,I bought this for my grand son who is a Pokemon lover. The disk was reasonably priced as it has two sides and contains at least six full length cartoon adventures. He loves it.,1365292800,,176,4.205882352941177
4498929,5,B004YCKJVA,"Great product if you can find for a decent price. Has four awesome Pokemon movies in it. If you don't watch any of the previous ones, I think its fine but to watch any that come later, these are a must watch.",1363478400,,208,3.9761904761904763

4498934,5,B004YCKJVA,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest,1355788800,,135,4.666666666666667

4498938,4,B004YCKJVA,"So even after all the reviews, the warnings of buzzing noises and poor quality, I decided to buy it myself. Honestly, it came to my house very fast, and I was happy with it. The only one that really had a buzzing noise for me was the Pokmon 4Ever movie. All of the others were in decent quality. Yes, it does not have anything ""extra"" just the four movies. But for any collection, I feel that it is perfectly fine. If you just want to enjoy the Pokmon movies, then this is worth your money. If you would rather have perfection, then I would try them separately.",1330387200,2,561,4.252336448598131
4498939,4,B004YCKJVA,"im a huge Pokemon fan and this is a good deal for 10 dollars it may be on one disk but its good movies and i loved it shipping was decent and it wasn't scratched, id recommend it if you like Pokemon , i just wish they had the fist 4 for the same price xD",1329782400,,254,3.5535714285714284
4498940,3,B004YCKJVA,"I bought this ""collection"" from my local Target store for only $4.99 thinking I was getting a bargain, which I did. I had no problem with the DVD case or cover/back art either, it wasn't fantastic but what can you really ask for? I opened my copy a few hours after getting home with it to find that its just a plain, literally no disc artwork, NOTHING disc that contains all 4 of the movies listed that it comes with on ONE double sided disc. I honestly didn't care for this, at least slap some god damn artwork on the disc to make it look a little bit less like a bootleg/the cheap release it really is.

I'm a huge Pokemon fan, and instead of paying $10+ dollars for each of these movies I won't lie, its easily a better deal to just settle for this, and trust me when I say SETTLE for this. All 4 of these movies (as far as I know) are out of print so finding them new in the original 2003-2007 releases could prove to be an issue and if you just wanna complete your collection or just have all of these movie like me, a classic long time fan of the old series back when 4Kids was doing their version of the dub and not the terrible Pokemon USA dub that is released these days.

OVERALL: If you are looking for an absolutely bare-bones, no inserts, no extras, no disc art, double sided release for all 4 of these movies this is the product for you. If you are looking for the original extras (Suicune card, Pikachu Shorts, Inserts, etc) then have a nice time trying to find those new and unopened. My only advice is to check your local Toys R Us, Wal-Mart or Target before placing an order for this online. I found mine for $4.99 at my local Target down the street like I said and I was pretty pleased (again, settling) for what I paid.. in the end it comes down to can you settle for less? If yes, buy. If no, search for the original releases.",1329350400,10,1847,4.156424581005586
4498941,5,B004YCKJVA,"This was available at a great price.  All 4 movies are on the one DVD, as it's a dual-sided disc. The odds of one of the sides getting scratched and becoming unplayable is pretty high considering that this was purchased for an 8 year old little boy.  I have to admit that it isn't the best video or sound quality either.  However, because of the great price, I can definitely overlook these things.",1328054400,2,398,4.424657534246576
4498942,3,B004YCKJVA,"The product itself was fine, each of the movies ran without any real issues. However, there are no extra features at all, just the movies, no subtitles or anything. Being a two sided disc, it can be a bit confusing, as well as easily running the risk of scratches. If handled by a child, it is very likely that the movies will stop working very quickly. A single good scratch on one side could cut out two movies. If handled by children, it certainly won't last. Good product idea, though, to get the movies out there and for a better price than if purchased separately.

At the time, I had paid more than the current price. Shipping had been fast, yes, even with the free shipping. However, I found this product cheaper at my local Target store for $5.00. Had I known this originally, I just would have gotten it there.",1327276800,,820,4.430463576158941
4498943,5,B004YCKJVA,My 8 yr old son loves this dvd.  We have not noticed any of the image quality issues that were noted by other reviewers.  You should know that there are videos on both sides of the dvd--just wanted you to know so you don't miss half of the episodes.  I recommend this dvd for any lover of pokemon.,1326672000,2,297,4.086206896551724
4498944,5,B004YCKJVA,"I was wary of buying this because of the review stating that the video quality is bad.  I disagree.  We have a 61"" HD at 720dpi (not 1080 as it's several years old) and bought the DVD (not blu-ray) for our kids for Christmas, and the video quality to me is just as good, and actually better, than the quality of the TV shows that come on DirecTV.  The regular shows are just cartoons with nothing special in the graphics, whereas the DVD has come computer-generated images that actually look pretty good.  Will this blow you away like some fantastic 1080 resolution blu-ray movie might?  No, but who cares?  It's not drawn that way and it looks better than what my kids are used to.  Also, there aren't any noise problems on the disk that I have.  The movies play just fine, and they sound fine, too.  I would not hesitate to get this DVD again or recommend it to someone else.  I mean, for under $10 for four movies, how can you go wrong?  This purchase was WELL worth the money to me.  I have no reservations whatsoever.  My kids love it, and that's the main thing.",1325030400,2,1067,4.328282828282828
4498945,4,B004YCKJVA,"I was a bit worried when I opened the case, the disc was not snapped down, but I didn't see any scratches. I was very surprised to find all 4 movies on a dual sided disc instead of on two - four discs. If this movie is scratched it's likely I'll lose a minimum of 2 movies possibly all 4. I've stressed this to my children who are 8 and 10 but let's face it.. they are kids. I really hope someone releases ALL of the Pokemon movies on DVD so that I can purchase those. For the price I paid this disc is a good value. Take care of it if you choose to purchase.",1321401600,,559,3.8275862068965516
4498946,5,B004YCKJVA,"The video quality is fine, its not below average or anything, what you see is what you get, this definately is worth $12. I loved watching these movies as a kid and its great to have them in one CD, even though i recommend to anyone looking to buy a cheap set of the movies, i suggest you save up your money for better versions of the DVDs. All in all great product worth the money, the case was in perfect condition and came a couple of days early.",1317081600,13,449,4.056179775280899
