6433413,4,B00KLIXDMS,"This is a old Nicole Kidman movie that is released under two different titles. ""The Christmas Stallion"" and ""A Bush Christmas"".  It is a nice little adventure flick about a group of children in Australia chasing down a couple of horse thieves who have stolen their family race horse that they were counting on racing on New Years Day and saving their ranch.  Entertaining.  It does need to be pointed out that this was one of Nicole Kidman's early roles.  Also humorous is the fact that she was so tall even as a young teen and she is well over a foot taller than the young cousin from England that has a crush on her.",1416268800,9,618,4.3478260869565215

6433417,2,B00KLIXDMS,"This was a really old movie and I didn't realize that when I ordered it for a Christmas gift.  It's one of Nicole Kidman's first movie roles, information which wasn't readily available in the description.  It was cheap, and maybe it's good, but I was under the impression it was a nice DVD for Christmas and was disappointed.",1409011200,,325,4.586206896551724
