8356565,5,B0028ON788,"""Terrie Anne Bennett was the key to most of the improvement in my own skiing and coaching over the last couple of seasons. This DVD provides a wealth of information, and it captures Terrie Anne at her best: her explanations are clear and concise, her demonstrations illuminating, and her enthusiasm contagious. And, as always, her skiing inspires me!"" --Gerry Bell, PSIA Level II, Sunday River Perfect Turn",1242259200,5,406,5.074626865671642
