8442774,4,B004V2FUF8,"Its the 80s of Bollywood , so what do ya expect? Its melodrama, dance , music , fun all the way!
The hero, seems to be the Michael Jackson of India & it shows in an utterly entertaining way. Just remember to keep aside any logic whatsoever , grab yer pop corn & soda ...enjoy all the way! Its hilarious(unintentionally) , has lots of dance , music and fun. Basically a revenge story of a kid whose father is brutally murdered and he grows up to avenge ; only as a disco dancer. This is similar to movies like DISCO DANCER, DANCE DANCE etc. but probably more entertaining.",1305849600,,571,4.296296296296297
