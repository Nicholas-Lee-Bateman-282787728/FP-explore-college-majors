8103188,3,B000E0OBFQ,"It's hard to comment on or even say anything about Cambrian without feeling awkward. On one hand, it feels like I finally encountered the anime of my dreams: a considerably non-violent tentacle/monster hentai with a moody artistic presentation, interesting characters and soundtrack complete with steamy sexual encounters. On the other hand, it feels like a pretentious, incomplete piece of crap that forces you to invest more time, money and consideration into it than its worth. Seriously, I've never felt more impressed and cheated watching hentai in my life!

Firstly, let me talk about what this OVA does right: the animation is near perfection in this title. The characters are fantastically well drawn and there's very little continuity/editing errors, all of which are huge pluses on my part. Sure, there's that odd fact that most of the Asian female cast have downright rockin' racks like they're all Kei Kishimoto clones (hoh, I wish), but they're all drawn really well regardless.

The soundtrack is actually pretty effective here and is quite more noticeable than most hentai. Most the time, the hentai is dead quiet as if it's trying to go for a Horror movie angle, but when the music does come up it's really moody and even manages to be steamy when there's a strange sexual encounter. Also, in regards to horror themes and moodiness, Cambrian is a relatively clean hentai for the most part. The most disturbing scene of sexuality and violence mixed in is when a character has an almost paranoiac induced flashback where they recall losing their virginity from being raped by a random scum-bag.
A monster hentai that has uncomfortable human sex? Y'know, that's actually more effective for a shocking/brutal monster hentai. Instead of throwing random full-body mutilation, castration or instant dehydration during the monster sex scenes, throw in human sex that's more violent than the monster sex! Maybe this is one of few hentais that can actually pass as artistic rather than childish or smutty.

Of course, all of this is destroyed in the beginning by a rather pointless and inexplicable scene of a nameless dark haired woman getting pleased by tentacles... who dies for no reason whatsoever! Okay, maybe the series will later explain this, but one minute this woman is writhing in joy whereupon tentacles just suddenly show up from... someplace that I hope they didn't show-up from. The next ten seconds, the woman is on the floor in a puddle of blood. We later see this woman's body with the tentacles and what appears to be barnacles on her limbs and there's not a drop of blood around her. GREAT. So much for the whole `art' argument, let alone good continuity!

Also, while most the editing is okay, there are a few sex-scene padding choices I can't help but question. In the two present-time sex scenes involving the main character - which comprises 85% of the sex scenes - there are these awkward shots that focus entirely on the heroine getting screwed. But the shot doesn't go anywhere! It doesn't pan or zoom or pivot or turn in place... the shot just stays on Keiko getting slammed in one position for about ten seconds before moving on to a better shot.

What gets to me about this hentai is the fact that it has the title `Cambrian' in it, yet no where in this hentai do we see anything Cambrain related. Okay, we see some tentacles and a mutant with wonky appendages, but that's selling it short!! Nowhere in this hentai do we see a giant, sentient Anamalocarus or a horny humanoid Opabinia or even a lustful Trilobite! The creature design for this hentai could've been outright brilliant, yet all we get are some octopi tentacles and a hyper advanced, over-sexed Steve Burnside clone... thank God there's no random Bullet Time action sequences in this!

I really don't know what to think of this title: the animation is absolutely fantastic with very few errors in continuity, a surprisingly effective and moody soundtrack, decent characters and some good sexual content. Unfortunately, it takes FOR-****ING-EVER to get to any tentacle scenes with acceptable length; most Urotsukidoji episodes had more sex per Part. Yet, once the story to Cambrian actually gets going the episode immediately ends. That's the worst part about this hentai: the disc has only ONE episode with a run time of less than 30 minutes!! Perhaps I'm losing my respect for art in its various forms, but for an anime hentai, this is inexcusable on a technical level. You know what this means... the second part of this series is going to be as short and it's on another disc; you mean to tell me that Milky's DVD distributor didn't have enough money to put BOTH episodes on a single disc? Put together, these episodes would last the length of the average movie and trust me, that's not a bad thing!

Oh well, if you want some brief, but nice tentacle sex and good animation then I suppose you could get this. The stupid opening aside, the hentai has its unique disturbing moments that are certainly better than most... but why do I get the feeling that all of this is for naught? Why do I have this terrible feeling that this hentai is going to go somewhere it shouldn't?? Maybe its because the next part is merely the end of the full-length feature here..? And usually, the end of a hentai series is almost always the worst part...",1259452800,,5336,4.825136612021858
