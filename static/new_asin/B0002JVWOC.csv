WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS

Cheburashka is found in a crate of oranges and since the guy who found him thinks he's clumbsy and doesn't know what the heck he's supposted to be, he calls him Cheburashka.  So he takes him to the zoo, but the zoo rejects poor Cheb (sort of Cheburashka).

Meanwhile it turns out that the animals in the zoo are just there for work and not to live.  One of them is Crocodile Gena, who for some reason is a really nice crocodile.  Well Gena is lonely and is looking for some company, so he sends out a message saying he wants a new friend.  A dog and a girl come to his appartment and so does Cheb, who now lives in a phone booth all bored.  Well nobody still knows what in the heck Cheb is supposted to be, but they befriend him anyways.

Meanwhile there is this old woman named Shapoklyak, she goes around town, with her pet rat, playing tricks on people, and even tries to get Cheb and his new friends to do the same thing.  They think it's silly and she vows revenge on the Cheb Gang.  So anyways to make a long story short, the Cheb Gang builds a home for people who are having trouble finding friends.

There are also three other stories about Cheb and Crocodile Gena in this DVD.  It's very almost goody-tooshoo for me.  But it's defently for children.  I recommend it highly, and the best thing of all, not propaganda related!  It's probably the best thing that ever came out of the Soviet Union period!  So just watch Cheb and Crocodile Gena and be dazzeled!",1201132800,6,1601,4.351351351351352
