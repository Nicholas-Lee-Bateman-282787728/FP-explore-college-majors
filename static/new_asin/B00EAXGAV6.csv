8603348,5,B00EAXGAV6,Richard Rohr's teachings just make sense - are easy to understand and grasp. He places God here with us. He debunks many of the controlling beliefs of our main line churches. He takes God out of the confines of our churches and puts God with us - his people and all of His creation.,1431561600,2,282,4.2407407407407405
8603349,4,B00EAXGAV6,Very well received in our church study group.  Rohr is charming on the video. This can lead to very deep theological discussion which was right for our group but might be new territory to others.,1419724800,,195,4.571428571428571
8603350,5,B00EAXGAV6,"This DVD, in my opinion, is an eye-opener for those of us who sometimes get stuck in the old legalistic notion of theology. I loved this DVD and truly feel like it has had an impact on my life.  I heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more realistic view of religion.",1411862400,4,282,4.127272727272727
8603351,5,B00EAXGAV6,"Fr. Richard speaks from experience and is one of the most profound writers on Christian spirituality today!  The idea of ""Alternative Orthodoxy"" is powerful and as the church today redefines itself to the modern era, this may be a glimpse of one of the most lasting theologies of the 21st century.",1403654400,4,297,4.823529411764706
