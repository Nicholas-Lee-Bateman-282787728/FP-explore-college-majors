529210,4,630297352X,"A grubby Spader is barely recognizable and proves why Hollywood needs a B Movie Awards Show; he really excels as this seedy soul living hand-to-mouth. And who knew Mandy has all those muscles! I found this sparsely decorated movie intriguing. With hardly any budget spent on plot, costumes, or musical score, and all of it put into the actors, I HAD to learn what became of this pair. Spader and Mandy are the music and they're random meeting is the chance. Like a piece of music that saddens you, yet holds your attention, so is this little movie. It plays out like it plays out; like life plays out for each of us.

529212,4,630297352X,"James Spader and his ""True Colors"" co-star Mandy Patinkin play a pair of newly-acquainted men who hope to out-play an eccentric pair of millionaires in a high-stakes poker game.  Not only do they lose, but they must work off their debt in a rather unorthodox indentured-servitude kind of way.  Both men had their own financial troubles and reasons for getting into the poker game in the first place, but neither of them realized exactly how costly their repayment would be.
In an interesting casting twist, Spader plays the oily, hustling loser of the two.
The final scene poses an interesting possibility  - that the end result of their misadventure is part of the cyclic karma that put them there in the first place.  Or something like that.",1029196800,18,743,4.826771653543307
529213,5,630297352X,"Making a film from a brilliant novel is a risky venture any way you look at it. The list of failures would run into the thousands. Granted, there have been some good ones: 'The Godfather' series comes to mind. So when I came across ~ The Music of Chance~ in the video store, I thought, ""Will I take the chance?"" How could anyone make or even think about making a film from this exceptional novel? It would be too difficult. Well, without question, director and co-screenwriter, Phillip Haas, pulled it off with such flair and elegance that it drove to return to the novel and experience once again.
James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) has taken to the road without any particular destination in mind, and has been travelling for over two years. One day he picks up Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a poker player of apparent talent. An instant friendship follows, and they go in for a bizzare game of poker with two millionare, highly eccentric recluses in a far off manor in Pennsylvania. A strange twist of chance occurs during the game and our two protagonists lose everything. The two recluses make a deal to even up the debt, which James and Jack will regret for the rest of their lives.
The movie and novel's genius is the surface-mundane plot and the profound themes simmering underneath the day to day. What does it really mean to take responsibility for one's actions? How far do we take responsibility with others? Is there such a thing as luck? Are we fated to suffer as human beings? Is there growth in suffering? Can we control our destinies and how do we react when hard times befall us? The novel and surprisingly the film ask these weighty questions directly and through metaphor, pushing us to think about our lives.
One of the disappointing aspects about watching a film adaptation is the characters and environment never match-up to what one mentally generated while reading the book. Directors, too, will use creative licence and insert their own interpretation, at times ruining the original plot. Haas remained on task, however, and the film ran very close to the novel. Mandy Patinkin is James Nashe and James Spader as Jack Pozzi was as close to an accurate interpretation of a literary charcter as one could possibly attain: first class acting.
~The Music of Chance~ has been described by some as being a parable on the human condition. If one watches closeley, this film, without being entirely conscious of it, guides you through the big questions, and gently leaves you pondering.
This film is very cool, intelligent with an incredible amount of panache.",1019001600,17,2569,4.788288288288288
529214,5,630297352X,"What a mysterious and subsuming story. This movie is so obscure and inconspicuous in its packaging it's lucky anyone has seen it at all. But I keep coming back to it. For me it begins with Mandy Pantinkin being such a subtle and sincere and moving actor. And his character, the way that he accepts his predicament and abstains from negativity, doing whatever his captors ask of him. And then his deep brooding silence late at night in the trailer. The obscurity of his background and his future. This is a very personal film to me. There is so much going on under the surface. And then James Spader, the somewhat shallow foil, but not insincere person, who is ultimately ruined by his inability to follow the rules. My only criticism is that there are too many loose ends toward the end of the picture. Somehow that doesn't lessen my opinion of the movie though. This one got me turned on to Paul Auster. I've now read several of his books and loved them.",1018656000,6,955,4.494252873563219
529215,4,630297352X,"Not for all tastes, this film combines the unique film making approach of Philip Haas (Angels and Insects) with a story by one of our most profoundly intellectual novelists of the 20th century, Paul Auster.
Dramatically  understated, `The Music of Chance' chronicles one man's search (Mandy  Patinkin plays Jim Nash) for himself, as he quits his job, loads his car  and heads cross country. That his path crosses that of Jack  Pozzi (James  Spader) a drifter, card-sharp, down on his luck today, but eye's on the  `big score' ahead, is not exactly unpredictable. What they encounter as a  result is indeed surprising, as well as strenuous, and all together  inappropriate to be delivered in the fantasy medium of film.
When I read  the book, I stumbled over the text, the words weighing heavy on my being.  Reading and rereading, the labor of the learning was far more than that  which had yielded the purchase price.
Every twist and turn of the plot  deals more multiple metaphor. Don't look to walk away from this one with a  pleasant taste in your mouth, but you may find yourself a better person  having watched it. Look for a Paul Auster cameo at the end.",952992000,9,1160,4.706467661691542
529216,5,630297352X,"This was a very enchanting and absorbing story, with wonderful acting and some memorable lines of dialogue. What particularly stuck with me was the character Nash(played by Mandy Patinkin)and his attitude about misfortune  in life. No one is totally in control of what happens to him, and  misfortune befalls everyone. The point is that it serves no purpose to feel  sorry for yourself when something goes wrong for you, you should just work  work towards getting out of the predicament you are in(and accept whatever  you can't change). Everyone has things they want in life, and everyone has  to undergo some kind of hardship to get them. It made me feel that there is  a kind of inspiration even in what you have you have to suffer when  overcoming your setbacks, because it is all part of the same process of  setting yourself free to realise your dreams. This idea was symbolised in  the story when the two main characters are held in a seemingly inescapable  situation on the grounds of a mansion, working off their debt to two  millionares by building a wall for them. It's the kind of film that could  lead you to great things-it could inspire you to accept austerity  unflinchingly to get what you want. What a blessing this film!",945561600,8,1239,4.702325581395349

7833238,4,630297352X,I worked on this movie and I never got to see it as the cast & crew screening was in NY and I lived in LA. We filmed in North Carolina but most of the crew was from NY and a handful from LA. I recently decided to buy it so I could finally see it. So much was left on the cutting room floor. Entire scenes that were important are missing. I always felt the script was very good and the casting was amazing. The director was very green but thankfully he had seasoned actors that didn't have to rely on his lack of experience. It's a shame so much was left out of the film.,1411862400,6,570,3.8803418803418803

7833241,5,630297352X,"Paul Auster is a brilliant screenwriter (see SMOKE), and this haunting film (which seems to have been shown in only a few theaters) is truly fascinating.  I'd call it a parable of contemporary life, but thematic analyzing is above my pay grade, so watch it and decide for yourself.  One of my top 20 films.",1394582400,2,306,4.545454545454546
7833242,3,630297352X,This is a strange little art-house film that holds your attention simply because you have no idea just where it is going or why. I found the ending unnerving but oddly fitting. A surprisingly different role for James Spader to play and I am not sure he pulled it off in his usual competent way.,1168473600,,294,4.363636363636363
7833243,5,630297352X,"I simply can't imagine why this terrific film is not available on DVD.  If you like James Spader, and watch ""Boston Legal"", here is a chance to see him early on.  This was one very, very, VERY strange film, with Spader and Mandy Patinkin, among others.  ""Darkly funny"" many critics said; and it was indeed dark, and perhaps, wryly humorous.  A wonderful, stark fable about freedom . . . ?  Do not see it alone, gather a bunch of friends, and be prepared for a great discussion afterwards.",1140566400,6,488,4.5
