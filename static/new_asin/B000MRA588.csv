The comedians complement each other well, with different styles, type of jokes, and being from various parts of the Middle East.

I got the dvd used through amazon for $3 and includes free shipping so that was fair to try out this dvd.  I was definitly fooled with the 4.5 star rating.

My favorite by far is Aron and Dead follows. I'm of Palestinian decent so it's great to see Arab comedians especially Palestinians try to promote stand up in the Arab world.

2740682,5,B000MRA588,"This is a live performance of 4 Middle-Eastern American stand-up comedians before an audience that appears to be mainly Middle-Eastern-American. Each comedian, including a Palestinian-American, an Iranian-American, and others, gives a 15-20 minute performance focused on the post-9/11 status of Middle-Eastern Americans in the U.S. They are all hilarious and enlightening, but Maz Jobrani, the Iranian-American, is the best.

I have used this dvd, or portions of it, for teaching 2 different courses. I played the whole thing for a 10th grade history course on the Middle East. The students found it hilarious, and were able to apply their newly acquired knowledge of the Middle East to their appreciation of the comedy. I am also using it in a freshman composition course at a 2-year technical college. As a writing exercise, I am showing 1 of the 20-minute performances (Maz Jobrani), and asking the following questions: What information does Jobrani provide about Iran, Iranian culture, the Persian language, and Iranian-Americans? What issues does he raise that Iranian-Americans are faced with? How does he characterize the way other Americans perceive him as an Iranian-American? How does he make use of humor to convey a message about Iranian-Americans to his audience? What possibilities does he suggest for bridging the gap between Iranian-Americans and other Americans? How would you describe his overall attitude about being an Iranian-American in America (angry, resentful, bitter, cynical, hopeful, etc.?)

As a teaching tool, the only drawback is that the F-word is used liberally throughout all of the performances, and there are some non-verbal scatalogical and sexual references that might not be appropriate in the classroom. I found that, with the proper introduction, my 10th grade students were able to have an intelligent discussion after viewing it, without descending into inappropriate talk.

This live stand-up comedy collection is both entertaining and educational.",1290297600,2,1992,5.546052631578948

While there were some funny bits and chuckles, I really didn't feel like the 4 comics had successfully drawn me into their world or shared with me how they had overcome ""evil"" (such as discrimination, or stereotyping) with laughter. So it was all good fun, but nothing really edgy or insightful.

Airport security was prime target for most if not all of them, but most comics, even the non-middle-eastern ones had also poked fun at that. So they offered little in terms of fresh perspectives.

I'm not sure whether the comedians' tame tone on this DVD reflects their true dispositions, or whether it's due to the fact that they feel they're in a precarious position in the Western world. Either way, the result is an entertaining, generally unchallenging set of reflections and life stories.

However one of the comics does manage to jolt us down to a deeper level of understanding about how dangerous schisms can suddenly form. He says that for most of his life, he was just an American, just a guy - then 9/11 happened - and probably forever after, he will be perceived first and foremost as ""an Arab.""",1192233600,3,888,4.649681528662421

2740799,5,B000MRA588,"If you've seen the Axis of Evil on Comedy Central, you should know they cut out about 20 minutes of the show in order to fit it into a 1 hour time slot.  What got left on the cutting room floor ranged from inconsequential bits to some segments that were actually pretty funny.  When you watch the full length show, it's fall-on-the-floor hilarious.

Aron Kader is the weakest of the comics, but he's still pretty good.  The strongest are Ahmed Ahmed and Maz Jobrani with Dean Obeidallah somewhere in the middle.  These guys are exactly what we need right now:  laughter and humour aimed at our current neurosis, terrorism.

You won't be disappointed.",1186358400,2,650,4.699115044247788

2740841,5,B000MRA588,"Since the Blue Collar team, it was a challenge for me to find a team that could bring laughter on everyday facts of life.  The Axis team brought a new perspective on being a part of middle-eastern heritage and the effects of post 9/11.  Although the quad team touched on certain sensitive issues on eating pork, national security, Jews - it was done with a dosage just enough to let a sensible and logical person understand the challenges we face in today's society (with the flavor of humor).  Among the quad team, in my opinion, Maz Jobrani and Dean Obeidallah are the cream-of-the-crop in the team.  Especially Maz, he is totally hilarious.  Although Ahmed and Aron are funny on their part, the delivery method or Maz and Dean are outstanding, fresh and at the same time provoking.  This DVD will definately be in my permanant collection.  This is money well-spent and entertainment worth watching (and listening to).  2-thumbs up + 2-big toes up!!!",1184371200,3,952,4.7975460122699385

2740844,4,B000MRA588,"All four of the comedians treated their sensitive subject matter with dignity yet with a great comedic flair. They could each poke fun at their own nationality's foibles and stereotypes while making me as the viewer, stop and think whether I had ever unconsciously put a person in a generalized category, instead of treating him or her as a unique individual.",1183420800,,359,4.901639344262295
2740845,5,B000MRA588,"My husband and I saw the shorter premier on Comedy Central and immediately bought this dvd.  And I don't regret it ONE bit!!  We're kind of comedy nuts, but we have watched this with a very diverse group of friends, and they all enjoyed it.  It's really refreshing to see a modern and liberal perspective of Muslims and Arabs.  And I really liked that it shows the mass public that not all Arabs are Muslim, and that not all Muslims are Arab.  I mean, c'mon, a Mormon Arab!

The show is completely quotable and, for me, that's a sign of how entertaining it is!",1180742400,4,560,4.336538461538462
2740846,4,B000MRA588,"The Axis of Evil Comedy Tour DVD is quite entertaining.  No matter what you nationality, race, or religion - you will enjoy watching this.  The four comedians Ahmed Ahmed, Aron Kader, Maz Jobrani and Dean Obeidallah are quite a dynamic quad in this DVD.  They each perform about a 20 min act drawing from their own experiences and background.  Interestingly enough, after watching this DVD, I decided to see them in a live show in Chicago.  I thought Dean Obeidallah, Aron Kader and Maz Jobrani were excellent (even though a lot of the material was identical to the DVD, so I was slightly a little bored).  I was extremely  disappointed in Ahmed Ahmed's act.  If I had known that there would be some negative religious antics about Prophets (of any religious orientation)  I would not have went.  Ahmed Ahmed's poor taste reflected his poor deliverance as well.  He seemed unsure of himself when he was describing Prophet Moses's delusional experience with the burning bush and being lost for 40  years (Ahmed Ahmed described this experience with the likely hood of weed being involved, hence it is ok to smoke) .  I am not a religious zealous, however, unlike the act in the DVD, he was insulting Prophet Moses. Many in the audience and I found this extremely disrespectful and distasteful.  He received no laughs and a lot of heckling, appropriately.  Ahmed Ahmed mumbled something about hypocrites after the negative response.  He should know is audience.

Just a caveat, there is a lot of profanity in the DVD as well as the live act.

I do want to applaud the four comedians for their contribution to better the Arab American cause through comedy.  Laughter makes the world a happier place.",1180656000,2,1695,4.802768166089965

These guys are simply the best! I wish they had some more deleted scenes, or special material.

This would have been a nice addition to the hilarious comedy already on DVD",1179705600,4,370,4.6923076923076925
2740850,5,B000MRA588,"This DVD is fantastic. All four comedians are hilarious and the DVD has more of their jokes than the Comedy Central special (which was also good). If you saw the special, the DVD is still worth it because of the extra material.

Also, not only can you jump from comedian to comedian, you can jump from one joke to another if you want. It also has extras which are cool.

I definitely recommend this DVD to any comedy lover.",1179619200,3,423,4.341772151898734
