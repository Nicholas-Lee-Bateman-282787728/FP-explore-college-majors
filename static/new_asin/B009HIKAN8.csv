5338301,1,B009HIKAN8,"I'm a big fan of Willis and D'Onofrio and it would seem after watching this picture that they did Fire with Fire for the gas money. Both of these excellent actors were hardly in the film as the movie revolved around Josh Duhamel's part. And boy did he stink in this. He was barely believable as a fireman, let alone a vengeance filled bad guy in this. If he got kicked around like that in real life, he would have been road kill inside of ten minutes. I was hoping for a smart action film and ended up with mere minutes of Willis, D'Onofrio with a really bad accent (what was that supposed to be anyway) and a really bad tattoo, and a total waste of Rosario Dawson - who is better eye candy than Duhamel. This was a predicable movie plot, a wasted cast and a waste of my time and money. Want better Willis? Go see Looper. Want better D'Onofrio? Go see any of the Law and Order repeats. Want better Duhamel? Don't hold your breath.",1352505600,7,930,4.230337078651686
5338302,5,B009HIKAN8,"For those of you who haven't watched this movie yet, believe me when I tell you that you're missing out on a great crime thriller starring Bruce Willis teaming up with Josh Duhamel. The story will blow you away and Bruce's character as a cop along with josh's character as a vigilante once again gets out the best of them. I don't know why this movie didn't hit the theaters first, it's almost on the top of the chart because of it's storyline. ONCE AGAIN BOYS, YOU'RE ON FIRE!!!",1352505600,2,479,4.393258426966292
5338303,3,B009HIKAN8,"In Long Beach, there is a turf war going on. Firefighter Jeremy Coleman (Josh Duhamel) is a witness to a murder and has been placed in the witness protection program where he falls in love with a US Marshall (Rosario Dawson). Bruce Willis plays local police chief Mike Cella who would like very much to see crime boss David Hagan (Vincent D'Onofrio) go to jail.

While in the program, the bad guys find out where Jeremy is located and threaten to kill everyone Jeremy knows and their family. Jeremy goes vigilante in order to save himself and everyone else. He also gives us overwhelming clues about the ending.

I liked the climax of the film, in spite of the fact I knew it was coming from 30 minutes into the film. The script was overly predictable and the dialogue wasn't moving. Vinnie Jones gives us a brief bad guy, and likewise 50 Cent wasn't on screen that long. I would have liked to have seen more of Willis in the film.

Might work as a 99 cent rental for some people. Not a keeper.

5338304,3,B009HIKAN8,"The other reviewers have already supplied the general plot details, so I'll just add my overall opinion.  As my review title states, there is more talk than action, but the action sequences are good and entertaining.  One sore spot with me is that Bruce Willis was given first billing as the star, yet in the film he is nothing more than a paper pusher office detective who does not see any action.  He contributes very little to the general plot, and ZERO to the few action sequences.  Gosh, the producers could have used a fifth-rate, unknown actor from Iowa at 5% the cost of Willis, and the plot would have moved along just as well.  But I guess they just wanted to capitalize on his famous name, not caring that they were actually deceiving the movie viewers.  Makes me think this macho-man hero is getting too old and can't fight bad guys anymore (just like Steven Siegal).  No more Willis movies for me. This movie was a general disappointment.",1352073600,5,951,4.591715976331361
5338305,3,B009HIKAN8,"""I'm a ghost, I don't exist. I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna disappear and noone is ever gonna know."" After stopping at a convenience store and talking to his owner friend Jeremy Coleman (Duhamel) becomes witness to a double murder. When they decide not to kill him Jeremy is left alone to ID the murderer. Not wanting loose ends Jeremy is now a target and he must now fight for his life to survive and also to take care of the killer the the cops have been trying to get for years. I will start by saying that I am a pretty big Bruce Willis fan but he has been very hit or miss lately. I really liked ""Catch .44"" but thought ""Set-Up"" was lame. Also as a disclaimer the quote I used is actually from this movie, not from the movie Taken so don't let that confuse you. The movie itself isn't anything new or amazing but it is actually pretty fast paced and keeps you interested and watching the entire time. The movie when you break it down is just another vigilante type revenge movie but again because it's so fast paced and entertaining you can't stop watching. Also Vincent D'Onofrio gives such a great performance in this that watching for just for him is almost enough to keep you till the end. Overall, this is a fast paced exciting action movie that is the perfect kind to just put in and veg out to. I liked it. I give it a B.",1351814400,7,1355,4.2153846153846155
5338306,5,B009HIKAN8,"I thoroughly enjoyed Fire With Fire from start to finish. I very much identified with it and felt this could happen to me... or to you. I loved the storyline. If you are a Josh Duhamel fan, you won't be disappointed; he is great eye candy and his acting is consistent with his other roles. I thought many of the other actors were absolutely superb such as Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Vincent D'Onofrio (awesomely scary), Anthony Michael Frederick, Eric Winter, even 50 cent! This is a great movie for date night and both will feel satisfied that it was well worth the money. I recommend to not miss this great action crime thriller!",1351123200,,634,4.619469026548672

5338308,1,B009HIKAN8,"The fastest way to destroy a movie, is for the screenplay to be absolutely impossible, unrealistic, and to contain scenes and situations which could and would never happen. Such a film is usually finished as soon as a bad enough mistake or discrepancy presents itself. Sometimes if the ending is good and the film is overall entertaining enough, -and if these fatal mistakes I'm referring to are minor enough to be forgiven, the film can be salvaged to some extent in the minds of the viewers. But there comes a point, when even the intellect of the average person, is insulted so much, and the scenes are so unrealistic, that they make the film unwatchable. At that point it has to be turned off, and the time spent watching it to that point, must be considered wasted. Such is the case time and again, with this film. I really wanted to like it. But as soon as one fatal flaw presented itself, I knew the film could not be salvaged. That fatal flaw was when this so-called firefighter hero, that had the foresight to ask his firefighter buddy for his gear back (that belongs to the city), was allowed to keep his personal cell phone when going into the witness protection program. When going into witness protection, the agencies involved have to have as much intelligence about the person being protected as possible (such as their phone, cell number, and all communications with family, friends, etc.). Why? Because otherwise, it can totally destroy the program, waste resources and taxpayer dollars, and endanger the lives of the officers, agents, marshals, and other personnel involved. This is not something they take lightly. There is protocol which is always followed by necessity. Such as for an agent or marshal to never date a protected witness. Such a mistake is a career ending and potentially life threatening move. But in regards to this film, that was just the tip of the iceburg. There was so many inconsistencies and ridiculous scenes, it was totally unwatchable. I had to turn it off.",1523318400,,2004,4.794797687861272

I believe that's one reason we have corruption in law enforcement, the judicial system, and higher up, from pure fear. Sometimes, the scariest movies are true.",1522800000,,368,5.049180327868853

5338380,3,B009HIKAN8,"Sometimes films can be entertaining, but for one reason or another are utterly forgettable. In the case of Fire With Fire, I enjoyed the film, but even a few weeks later, I had a difficult time remembering the plot. This is because once again we have an action film that is completely average in every way possible. It's a common story, with a lot of bullets, f words, and bodies, featuring a cast that was far from superb. Jeremy Coleman (Josh Duhamel) is a firefighter who witness a horrible crime. As a result, Coleman is put into the Witness Protection Program, which according to Hollywood is completely inept. Once found, Coleman and his significant other are forced to go on the run and ultimately decide to take the fight to their pursuers, with mixed results. This film was completely predictable and lacked any originality what so ever. Josh Duhamel stars and while he is a good looking, gigantic man, he's not much of an action star. He's lanky, awkward, and simply doesn't have the moves or personality to be believable as an action star. The Director tries to correct this by surrounding him with veteran action stars like Bruce Willis and Vincent D'Onofrio, but it is still painfully obvious that Duhamel got the role simply to be eye candy, further proven by the amount of times he unnecessarily takes his shirt off. As with all action films, Fire With Fire has it's moments, and Vincent D'Onofrio is always an entertaining villain, but aside from that, this film is good for nothing more than a 90 minute distraction, that you probably won't even remember it a few days later.",1440028800,,1592,4.73021582733813

5338422,4,B009HIKAN8,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie - for what it is.  It's a (or should be) low-budget straight-to-DVD movie.

But...the acting is pretty good. I especially enjoyed Vincent D'Onofrio in a bad guy role. And he was an Aryan very bad guy in this film. Josh Duhamel was the protagonist of the film and he played a fairly inept average Joe for about 2/3 of the movie. Then vengeance mode kicked in and he went after the bad guys that dared threaten his girl and his best friends.

Bruce Willis had a very minor role but he was good in it.

So - watching this made for a good movie night with hubby. We both enjoyed the film. And how often does that happen?",1411344000,5,652,4.192
5338423,3,B009HIKAN8,Bruce Willis did not need to be in this movie. He must have done it for the money only. Otherwise not too bad.,1410998400,,110,3.8260869565217392

5338427,4,B009HIKAN8,"Everybody loves a good revenge movie.  This definitely fits the bill.  The movie's hero, a firefighter, is in a store during an execution by an Aryan Crime Lord.  He witnesses the entire thing and is not only able to identify the trigger puller but is willing to testify against the leader.  Federal marshalls put him in witnesses protection but that is eventually compromised.  When the leader starts messing with people close to the hero, the hero gets mad.

Bruce Willis plays a police officer from a small town.  During the entire film he only gets to hurt one guy.  Imagine!  Bruce Willis only hurting, much less killing one guy.

Revenge films are always good for action.  This film doesn't skimp there either.  The good guys remain good while the bad guys get their collective butts kicked.",1409356800,,797,4.779411764705882

Fantasy: In the movie, white neo-Nazis with Southern accents terrorize a black owned convenience store in a black neighborhood, shooting the blacks inside for no reason.
It would be like making a movie about slavery in the south, casting whites as the slaves and blacks as the plantation owners. The Japanese tortured and beheaded our WW2 POWs. The Germans treated our POWs well. The Holocaust story turned out to be false wartime propaganda (no gassings, planned exterminations, etc. See CODOH). The Germans never attacked the US. But who is still depicted as the definition of evil 70 years later? Not the Japanese. The anti-white media wants a White bogeyman.",1404000000,,914,5.1

5338443,3,B009HIKAN8,"The acting is convincing especially the actors who play the lawyer and David Hagan. They make me really hate the characters.

There are some touching scenes. For example the scene relates to Jeremys lover in the first 20 minutes of the movie. The dialogue between them is funny and interesting too.

The action scenes in the first 30 minutes are gripping and suspenseful.

It is outrageously far-fetched with gigantic logical holes. It depicts one ex-fire fighter who successfully fights against the whole group of professional criminals. Yeah right!

It is absolutely predictable from the beginning till the end. I do not know why the criminals who killed cops in the past became so stupid when they confronted the fireman.

In summary, it is worth watching once for fun. Just put your logic to sleep while at it",1399420800,,813,4.905109489051095

5338474,3,B009HIKAN8,"Brice Willis may be on the DVD jacket, but the star of ""Fire with Fire"" is Josh Duhamel playing a Los Angeles firefighter Jeremy Coleman in witness protection program. Though he has agreed to testify against a violent mobster David Hagan (Vincent D'Onofrio), Jeremy decides that it is up to him to protect those he loves from the sociopathic Hagan, so he takes some extreme measures, despite the advice from Rosario Dawson's deputy marshal assigned to the case (who is also Jeremy's girlfriend).

""Fire with Fire"" is a typical case of straight-to-DVD films, with a few A-list actors in a B movie format. You will notice a wealth of familiar faces like Kevin Dunn, Vinnie Jones and Richard Schiff, all typecast. The story may be as incredible as that of ""Collateral Damage,"" but it is not boring. Actions are not big, but acceptable.

In some low-budget action flicks, ""name"" actors are there to draw the attention of potential customers, but their roles in the actual films are often miniscule or at best extended cameos. In ""Fire with Fire"" second-billed Bruce Willis is wasted in a pointless role that is slightly better than the ones he played in ""Set Up"" and ""Catch .44.""

Keep your expectation level low, and you may find ""Fire with Fire"" pretty good. Except the climax scene (based on a questionable idea about fire and firefighter) the film does not have much new to offer, but is still watchable.",1367366400,,1404,4.793388429752066

Generally good cinematography and acting: Though I've never been a big Bruce Willis fan, his role here fits him well. Good supporting cast and characters, particularly Kevin Dunn as Agent Mullens. Though the film starts out promisingly, it later degenerates into a series of predictabilities, unrealisms, too-easies, and general corninesses, with dialogue that becomes flatter and less realistic as it proceeds. Still, it is very difficult to make a film that's totally clean of such elements, and here, as in many others, they do not come close to being completely ruinous.

A fireman testified against an organized crime syndicate and obviously some things go wrong so he has to fight his way out of trouble. The main character is kind of arrogant and cocky but overall likeable. The subplot with the romance was a little unbelievable but it wasn't bad. Not my ultimate favorite but I enjoyed it.

The ending doesn't spell out the future but I think the conclusion is a happy one.  The final actions aim you in a positive direction where you can be satisfied.

5338498,4,B009HIKAN8,I really liked this movie and the actors. Great story and was not boring at all. Josh Duhamel as always comes through. He is such a natural actor. And it helps that Bruce Willis was in it.,1360022400,,188,4.108108108108108

5338500,4,B009HIKAN8,"Very compelling movie about a fireman who is witness to a set of cold-blooded murders and how he uses his courage and creativity to resolve a dilemma beyond the scope of the criminal justice system.  Our hero is a reluctant hero - albeit a very capable one.  If action, heroism by the street guy and mayhem appeal to you, you should enjoy this movie a lot.  Violence is graphic.",1360022400,,378,4.449275362318841

5338505,2,B009HIKAN8,"First, Bruce Willis has barely a supporting actor role. He's hardly in it.

The script and the plot line is shallow.

It's a fun action movie, but definitely a B movie, which is surprising for these actors.

The movie never makes you really believe it and it's rather predictable.

All that being said, hubby and I enjoyed a good laugh with this cheesy but somewhat fun movie.",1359676800,,376,4.567164179104478

5338510,3,B009HIKAN8,"I figured this would be like most Bruce Willis films, action, action, action. But Bruce was barely in the movie and the parts he was in were dull, he's the office guy.

But it was a good movie, the other characters do very well, but just not an action flick, more of a drama maybe. I have to say though when Olephant gets going, his subdued violence was exciting, I think this was one of the only movies where I said ""Alright! out loud numerous times.",1359072000,,451,4.244186046511628

And like some other reviewers, I was surprised to see a movie with Bruce Willis included in both the cover art AND the script! I like movies that entertain me, not generally films that are too cerebral. This one has plenty of action, and in my opinion was some of Willis' best work since 'Tears of the Sun'. Oh, and Josh was pretty good too :-)",1358899200,,532,4.33

5338532,5,B009HIKAN8,I highly recommend this movie.  I always like it when good triumpts.  It's hard to go wrong with a Bruce Willis movie.  This will not disappoint.  Good cast of characters.  Lots of action.  Will have you on the edge of your seat.,1357257600,,229,4.333333333333333
5338533,2,B009HIKAN8,"Given the familiar story line of ""Fire with Fire"" it would have taken a good script just to get it to the level of 'same old same old.' But the script here is stupid to the point it barely reaches above bad.

Here's the scoop. Jeremy Coleman is a fireman in Long Beach. One night he's in a convenience store when Nazi thugs enter and kill the owner and the owner's son because they won't sign over the store lease.  He escapes and can rat on the group's leader (Vince D'Onofrio) but will need to go into protective custody. He agrees and, in the process, falls for his guardian U.S. Marshall (Rosario Dawson) when everything falls apart. Seems D'Onofrio is very resourceful and can track him and her down and kill both. Now our hero firefighter must fight ""Fire with Fire."" (right)

What a screw-up. This script is dumb beyond the meaning of the word. There are so many lapses in logic and procedure it's difficult to imagine how it ever got a green light. In one scene the marshals leave the hero alone which allows him to escape. Is that S.O.P.? It is also cliche ridden. This scenario has been done before. Many times. You need something really clever to raise it above the fray and that isn't happening here. It's one plodding, dumb scene after another.

Bruce Willis is on hand as a detective out to get D'Onofrio. Why is Bruce doing this part? He looks tired and bored. Does he really need the paycheck? I liked Josh Duhamel in ""Transformers"" but he just doesn't have the gravity to pull off the hero role here. I'm in love with Rosario Dawson but her role here is nowhere near deep enough for her to rap her talent around. The only standout part for me was D'Onoforio. He was the only character written with any depth. The directing never rose above hack level and all the production values were assembly line.

I knew this wasn't going to be great when I went in but I expected more than this. I expected at least some level of competency, but it just wasn't happening. Don't waste your time.",1357257600,3,2000,4.453551912568306
5338534,3,B009HIKAN8,"I think that Bruce Willis just makes movies to make movies these days.  Either he is in some financial trouble or just bored.  Who knows, but he continues to put out these ""half hearted"" movies.  I watched until the end, mostly because I had hoped it would get better.  It didn't and I like Josh also.  Somewhat disappointing and I probably was harder on this movie than most just because of the expectations.  Somebody please give Bruce a good movie!",1357257600,,451,4.575
5338535,5,B009HIKAN8,Action as usual with Bruce Willis.  I'll never tire of this man.  I enjoyed this movie as well.  Rosario & Josh are also good action players.,1357171200,,141,4.346153846153846

5338543,3,B009HIKAN8,"Wasn't sure what I was getting with this film. Somewhat surprised it went straight-to-dvd given a cast that includes, Josh, Willis, Rosario, Vincent, and 50 Cent. Really not a bad cast at all. As already mentioned, 50 and Willis have small roles. 50 Cent's role especially exited quick. There were a few things that were easy to guess about the film, but it was kind of nice to see the witness get extremely proactive and not stand around playing victim. Realistic, no. But still I enjoyed that twist. Managed to get in a little humor now and then while doing it too, which is always welcomed.",1356566400,,593,4.60377358490566
5338544,3,B009HIKAN8,"Although the plot becomes increasingly unrealistic as the story unfolds, I found this film entertaining and at times laughable.

5338576,3,B009HIKAN8,"Josh Duhamel stars in this fairly star-studded cast about a California fireman who's taken into witness protection after witnessing a brutal murder in a convenience store. The murderer ends up being a big time white supremacist, played by a scary and superb Vincent D'Onofrio. The opening scene involving a fire was stunningly show, suggesting the film would be a surprise, but as soon as the dialog began I was slightly disappointed. The acting is overall great, but some of the dialog and situations didn't seem natural. Otherwise the film was highly entertaining and great to look at.

5338577,3,B009HIKAN8,"I choose this movie because Bruce Willies was there, but actually he isn't there that much, not as I was expecting.
Thanks to Mr. Willies that is simply aging without botox or plastic surgeries, very remarkable in the Hollywood's panorama!
The movie is an ok action movie with a very bad SOB and our good-guys ready to die to make the truth win, nothing new under the sun.
It is nevertheless watchable.",1353974400,,402,4.597222222222222
5338578,4,B009HIKAN8,"I would recommend this movie for ppl that like action Survivial, mystery to put the movie in a couple of caterories",1353974400,,115,4.523809523809524
5338579,1,B009HIKAN8,"this movie is not your standard Bruce Willis movie. Too slow for me. Not worth watching the movie.
Go Bruce",1353974400,2,107,4.4
5338580,3,B009HIKAN8,"It was a decent action flick. The plot was predictable of course but it was one of those movies that ends like you expect but it was a satisfying ending. I am a fan of both Rosario Dawson and Bruce Willis but they seemed like they were just phoning in their performances, almost like the did the movie just as a favor to somebody. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as the bad guy was the best in the film. I liked the movie but I wasn't expecting a high budget, Oscar winning script and set. I would have been disappointed if I had been. It was a good entertaining B movie nothing wrong with that.",1353801600,,595,4.274336283185841
5338581,3,B009HIKAN8,"It seemed like the typical good guy got screwed, then get's pist and fights back. Considering the actors I did have higher expectations. I would probably watch it again but not for like a year or two. It's not one I would buy when the DVD is available.",1353715200,,252,4.270833333333333
5338582,3,B009HIKAN8,"Watched this with my dad and both of us enjoyed it for different reasons.  Him cause it was a shoot-me-up guy movie with typical guy plot.  I liked it cause of how cute the main actor is.  :)  WARNING: alot of cursing in the beginning that faises out throughout.  Very enjoyable if you don't mind the ""Die Hard"" type plot.",1353715200,,322,4.3
5338583,2,B009HIKAN8,"I am a Heat 1995 fan. Just couldn't get into this movie its so predictavle and corny. The main character I have seen in Transformers, he did well in it, (transformers) but he absolutley sucks in this. He has a hard time acting this one out.",1353715200,,240,4.239130434782608
5338584,3,B009HIKAN8,This movie was pretty much a feeble attempt at an old concept. Pretty much a B rated movie with a small cameo by Bruce Willis.,1353715200,,126,4.08
5338585,5,B009HIKAN8,"I think the movie was great and I (Herukhuti Ausar) was especially excited for having two of my songs featured in the movie. Show support for the movie and for the soundtrack that contains my two tracks ""Blood On My Shoes"" and ""Didn't Kill 'Em"". Much respect.",1353456000,,259,4.531914893617022
5338586,1,B009HIKAN8,"How can an action movie be so DULL?  How can so many good actors be in such a mess? It has to be a combination of bad editing and bad directing, right?  The director has done a lot of solid work and the action in the film is good, but the story seems lame somehow, and did not keep my interest, maybe i had seen the same sort of story before too many times?
  It just didn't compel me.",1353456000,4,385,3.8354430379746836
5338587,2,B009HIKAN8,"This film was the usual plot, usual characters, usual setting.  blah blah blah.  If you seen one; you've seen them all.",1353283200,,119,4.619047619047619
5338588,4,B009HIKAN8,"Bruce Willis is still Bruce. Maybe a little slower, not as dynamic, but still fun to watch. Josh Duhamel carried the action smoothly, along with Rosario Dawson. Overall, the movie was a very good action thriller. The script worked, the editing was tight, well, as tight as it could be for this genre. When things get slow, I'll probably watch it again.",1353196800,,352,4.693548387096774
5338589,3,B009HIKAN8,"You've seen this flapping turkey before. My biggest complaint is that i bought it instead or renting it via Netflix, cuz this is a one shot deal. Bruce Willis looked like he was on pain killers and never fired a round in this routine good guy on the run from the baddied. I counted three times when the heroes (a fireman who saw murders committed and a nicely-shaped US marshal who falls for the big lug) scuffle and lose their weapons and watch them skid across the smooth floor. Once, maybe, not three times in a movie. Willis could have been replaced with a cardboard cutout and we would have gotten the same visual results. Time for him to retire.
One major plus, the bad guy and his pack of blood-thirsty goons are terrific. They radiate evil and you want them to perish by the sword and slowly. I won't give away the main villain's name but he was in 'Full Metal Jacket' and he was masterful as the head whacko - one problem, not enough mayham by the vicious pack of mad dogs to really make them stand out among mad dog movie killeers - still, not too shabby as bad guys often make the film memorable.
Basic plot line that has been run over by Hollyweird writers scores of times over the decades, tired dialog and lots of mumbling draw this one down two stars and that modern director's flawed fast, lets strain older viewer's eyeballs type camera work knocks this down another half star. A few loose ends, some decent shoot-em ups (without old Bruce bustin' caps) and some vile baddies waiting to die make this one watchable - one time. Anyone want to buy a slightly used DVD in excellent condition? Only viewed once.",1353196800,15,1624,4.453020134228188
5338590,3,B009HIKAN8,"Firstly Bruce may be on the cover, but he is not on the screen for too long.  Instead Josh Duhamel is the lead and he does an admirable job of keeping the action looking believable.  This is not for the squeemish as some scenes are hard to watch, so if Reservoir Dogs' ear scene was tough to watch you may want to steer clear of this one.  I am happy I picked it up, but you may want to wait until it is under $10 before buying this one.",1353110400,,437,3.8876404494382024
5338591,5,B009HIKAN8,"Fast paced, great acting and a good story.  Perfect Saturday night movie. I thought that Josh Duhamel & Rosario Dawson are really solid in this movie.",1353110400,,150,4.769230769230769
5338592,3,B009HIKAN8,"Seems odd to have Bruce Willis and Josh Duhamel yet such a weak script and such an unassuming, joke of a putz for a ""bad guy""? He looks more like a janitor or used car salesman than a crime lord! If only they had a bit more quality on the script and a named actor up there with Willis for the ""bad guy"" this could've been a much better movie. if not for Bruce Willis and Josh Duhamel this wouldn't even be worth watching yet was a real waste of Willis's talents. In the era of bad retreads and just plain unwatchable movies I sat and watched this one which puts it in a certain class I just wish they'd gone the extra mile and a couple extra bucks and made this ""great"" instead of just ""ok"".",1352764800,,691,4.0510948905109485
5338593,3,B009HIKAN8,"I like Josh Duhamel. I thought he made the TV series LAS VEGAS interesting when he was there and he certainly fit the bill when he starred in the TRANSFORMER films. Why he hasn't been used more as a leading man I'll never know, but if his output is limited to direct to DVD films then I don't expect him to become the major player he should.

This brings me to FIRE WITH FIRE, the latest direct to DVD flick to highlight the fact it was produced by the same people who brought you RIGHTEOUS KILL and 16 BLOCKS. Come on folks, we really don't care who produces a film because for the most part that's rarely a guarantee that the film will be any good. Fortunately here it turns out that it is.

Duhamel plays Jerry Coleman, a good guy and a fire fighter who witnesses a murder at the local quick mart after stopping in for snacks. The owner and his son are shot and killed in front of Jerry and only through some quick thinking does he escape only to be wounded in the process. Jerry goes to the police and with the sketch they do of the suspect the case pulls in Det. Mike Cella (Bruce Willis). The killer is David Hagan (Vincent D'Onofrio), a white supremacist who killed Cella's partner years ago. Released for that crime, Cella wants desperately to put him behind bars. With Jerry's testimony he can do that.

But things start off bad and eventually get worse. While in a line up to be identified, Hagan lets Jerry know he knows who he is and where he can find him. The D.A. offers Jerry witness protection via the U. S. Marshall Service and he takes the offer. His identity erased from all databases and moved to New Orleans, 8 months go by and the trial date is approaching. But that's not all that's happened.

While being guarded, Jerry has fallen in love with his protector in the Marshall Service, Talia Durham (Rosario Dawson). A big no no in the Service, she plans on moving back to his home town once the case is settled. Too bad Hagan was able to find their location and send in a hit man to kill them both. With Durham wounded, Jerry is able to contact the Marshall Service for help. Though they plan on protecting him more thoroughly this time a phone call from Hagan prompts Jerry to decide to stop running and take the man on on his own terms.

Dropping his agents, Jerry makes his way back home. Knowing that Hagan has been trying to take over turf held by the Crips, Jerry approaches them for a weapon. Once he's armed, he sets out to make sure that he gets Hagan before Hagan can get him.

So the revenge film is set in motion and the side characters offer nice support in this film that actually turns out to be quite well done. The look of the film is completely professional and looks slick. The acting is believable by all involved here. And the story isn't near as thin as a number of main stream major releases seen of late.

Going in I think that most people will know what to expect from this film. Willis has taken on the duties of packing the deck in a number of low budget films in the past few years and my guess is he's trying to pay back helping others on the way up. His name will draw viewers to this film even though he isn't the main focus of the film. But once you get started with this movie you'll find yourself drawn in and watch from beginning to end. It's not a bad movie and you'll get your money's worth with a rental.",1352764800,4,3364,4.25508607198748
5338594,4,B009HIKAN8,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Fire with Fire"" (An Action/Thriller DVD
review)...LIKED IT!!!

Genre: 8 Movie: 7

Checkout ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook

What's it about?
A fireman takes an unexpected course of action when a man whom he's
been ordered to testify against, after being held up at a local
convenience store, threatens him.

What did I think?
Having low expectations gave big rewards on this one.  I have seen a
few ""straight to dvd titles"" with Bruce Willis on the cover only to
find that he only has a small part in the movie.  In this movie, he
actually has a primary role and does well with it.  This is a
sleeper pick to put in your players...enjoy!",1352678400,,656,4.508474576271187
5338595,4,B009HIKAN8,"The reason I deducted one star was because the ending was left open. I hate when a movie leaves the audience with a question, especially if that question pertains to the status of the main characters. It is a fatal flaw that I believe some film makers do not grasp. If I spend 90 minutes or so watching the story unfold, it makes sense that I am interested in something about the story... Since I am interested in the story, it makes further sense that I want to know about the problems the characters are dealing with, how they respond, and what happens to them. Does the cowboy win the battle and the girl and ride off into the sunset? Does ET call home and get through? Does Batman and Robin escape the trap the Joker snared them in?  That is why I will tune in tomorrow night, same Bat time, same Bat channel. So it kindly torques my constitution when I give the writer/director my undivided time to follow the story, care about the characters, cheer them on and pray they are victorious...only to leave the theater wondering what happened to them. I want the story to have a solid ending, a firm conclusion. I want to know what really happened. The story was a little bit weak in that it was highly implausible. I will not drop spoilers. But I will just say that more time should have been spent on the front end, demonstrating that the hero didn't go from Common Joe to Billy Bad Ass overnight with little or no training. Bruce Willis' role is rather limited and more of a supporting nature. That was a let down as I have grown accustomed use to Bruce kicking bad guy rear-end.

Fifty-Cent has a minor supporting role, a cameo really, sporting a 1973 Jim Kelly look, which was kind of comical. I expected him to say: ""Man, you come right out of a comic book!""

The Fiver-Star winner in this movie was Bonnie Somerville. I was unfamiliar with her prior to this movie. The Irish Catholic from Flatbush, NY is quite the lass. Her supporting role could have been better defined but her screen appeal made up for the shortcomings in the script.

Rent it?  YES  Own it?  NAH!
