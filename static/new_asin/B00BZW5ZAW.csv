8575937,4,B00BZW5ZAW,"Beware: This's not an official DVD made by Ellen. They put Ellen's quote on the cover but below it says ""unauthorized."" Most of the content inside are just video clips I sometimes found on youtube and put together into a DVD. Because of that, the video resolution isn't very good. It doesn't have much recent updates either.

This DVD could be good for fans who have not searched around the internet/youtube much about Ellen's life, or have done so but have not already downloaded those material to their personal collection.

The merit of this DVD is that it has some 60% of important highlights in her life and career. So, it is somewhat informative. However, one important piece missing is an old ""E! True Hollywood Story"" about behind the scene situation of Ellen sitcom season 4. I stumbled upon that clip on youtube few years ago and only then I realized how much work went behind the scene to get the Puppy Episode on air. That was the video that made me realize of Ellen's serious side, her determination and dedication. If they're going to compile Ellen's highlights from youtube videos, they should include that story, also in a higher resolution than this.

Edit: I increase the rating because, as the time goes by, some of these old youtube clips are becoming harder to find. Channels that upload the clips get closed down or abandoned. So, a DVD like this does have a merit of serving as an archive for those clips. A lesson learned: if you are hardcore fans, you'd better download the clips after watching online.",1396742400,4,1527,4.690298507462686
8575938,1,B00BZW5ZAW,"This is the worst quality filming I have ever seen. Plus there is NOTHING funny in the whole very short ""documentary"".",1393545600,,118,4.666666666666667
8575939,4,B00BZW5ZAW,"Informative, but not what I was expecting. It takes about ten minutes for it to get interesting. I did learn a few things about Ellen that I had never heard before.",1380758400,5,164,4.32258064516129
