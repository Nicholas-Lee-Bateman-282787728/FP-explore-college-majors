4989381,4,B006HFXFAY,"This may be a bit confusing, but there are actually 2 Borgia series that were made in 2011:

- Borgia - a series made by Canal + (the European 'HBO'). To date, there is only 1 Season. Entire season is in English.
- The Borgias - a series made by Showtime. 2 Seasons to date, one on DVD/Bluray. Entire season is in English.

Borgia (Canal +): 4 out of 5 stars

- This series is very similar in nature with Rome and Mad Men. It deals with the politics of the time, has mostly brilliant writing and acting and tries to stay historically accurate, through most of the episodes. This is an adult show, with lots of violence and nudity - similar to Spartacus and Game of Thrones.
- Characters are well written and ruthless. Rodrigo Borgia is made similar to Rome's Caesar and played brilliantly by John Doman, an American actor.
- There is only one negative to an otherwise excellent show: the last episode has very weak writing (almost seems written by somebody else), hence the 4 stars.

The Borgias (Showtime): 3 out of 5 stars

- Writing is a notch better than Camelot and Tudors, but maintains the 'soap-y' aspect of these type of shows. Acting is very good, but characters are not developed well enough.
- Take first episode for example: 'Borgia' spends 2 episodes on how Rodrigo Borgia manages to outplay the Italian powerful families (Orsini, Sforza, etc) and become Pope. This is probably one of the biggest achievements of his life and an incredible one, considering he was Spanish and really an outsider among the Italian Cardinals. In 'The Borgias', the election takes 10 minutes of one episode. There is no explanation on how he manages to outsmart the other Cardinals or even who they are. And - that's ok, because this series is not Rome or Mad Men. Story is much lighter and historical accuracy is not such a big deal. Neil Jordan is a brilliant director, knows entertainment and that's exactly what this series is.
- Cesare is very much a soap character here, unlike the Canal + series where he is a complex character, fighting his inner demons. Same with Juan - almost a naughty teenager here vs the vicious and ruthless Juan in the other series. Still, both entertaining.
- On the negative side: what would it take for Showtime to add subtitles to their series? This is Closed Caption (like the Tudors too), but most older LCDs cannot display CC on HDMI ports. Thus, no subtitles.
- This series is entertaining, but nowhere as deep or powerful as 'Borgia', thus 3 stars.",1325030400,13,2483,4.595936794582393
4989382,5,B006HFXFAY,"Having now watched the first seasons of both the ""Showtime version *the Borgias*"". And this rendition "" Borgia""  both more than once... I can honestly say that there is no comparison. Borgia ( this version) is quite simply better in every aspect. Dont take my word for it, check it out on Netflix, you won't be disappointed.",1324339200,12,324,4.684210526315789
4989383,5,B006HFXFAY,"FANTASTIC !!!!! Everything is beautiful. The scenes the costumes the writing, the acting. I love this Mini Series. This one stars John Doman as the Pope and was made by the same man that makes mini-series for HBO. This is not ""The Borgias"" starring Jeremy Irons. It is ""BORGIA"" and it's SO MUCH BETTER than the Jeremy Irons version. This mini series is Wonderful. After seeing this one and then trying to sit thru ""The Borgias"" with Jeremy Irons I almost died of boredom.
This version is definately not for the faint of heart though. There is alot of blood, sex, sex and more sex, and tears. I was so engrossed I watched the entire first season, one episode after the other. I really enjoyed this mini-series. I loved the Tudors but this one is even better than the Tudors. It was filmed in France but filmed in English. I'm glad it's widescreen because the scenery is simply Stunning. After seeing this on Netflix (they have both versions) I tried to find it to buy and found it wasn't coming out until February 2012. Great mini-series. You'll love it. I Just wish it was coming out in Blu Ray.

03/07/2012 - UPDATE !!! WARNING !!!! Just a warning for those who are purchasing this DVD set. I pre-ordered from Amazon LLC and the 3rd disc would not load or play. I returned that set for a replacement and the replacement would not load or play either. I have asked for a refund and ordered a new copy from another seller. I'll let you know if all of the discs in the one from another seller play when they arrive but I don't suggest buying this one from Amazon LLC. I think they got a bad batch.

I understand that this version (Netflix) is said to be more factually accurate than that offered by the folks over at Showtime.  Nonetheless, I have enjoyed this version as well and all the new information presented that closed some of the gaps left by the incomplete Showtime rendition.  Admittedly, I still have some trouble with John Doman's American accent amidst so many Europeans.

4989390,5,B006HFXFAY,"I watched the Showtime series and liked it a lot, but was very disappointed to have it end so abruptly. I was excited to see the Netflix version but was apprehensive. The first few episodes were hard to get used to. It seems all the actors have different accents and seeing a familiar face, John Doman, among all the actors I knew nothing about was distracting. Soon though I was loving it. The acting is superb and the the story gritty and raw. I have read that this version is more historically accurate than the Showtime version for which I am grateful. It is not for the fainthearted or prudish. Lots of full frontal nudity, sex and violence. I have watched all 3 seasons and it just got better and better with a wonderful ending.",1451779200,,734,4.444444444444445

4989392,4,B006HFXFAY,"Like most here, I can't help but compare ""Borgia"" to ""The Borgias"" Showtime series.  Both take historical license, but as a longtime Borgia family ""fan"" and student, I believe ""Borgia"" is truer to the actual characters and the complex political machinations of the time.  I think the writing, acting, sets, cinematography, and costuming are better as well. At first, I was put off by John Doman's ""Rodrigo"", specifically the American accent.  But after a while, Doman's ability to capture the breadth and depth of Rodrigo's/Alexander's personality makes you forget about the accent.  Mark Ryder's ""Cesare"" is the gold standard by which I think future fictional portrayals of Cesare will be judged.  He delivers in spades the passion, genius, scheming, relentlessness, and overwhelming self-aggrandizement the historical Cesare is famous for, and is equally adept at showing the conflicted, occasionally compassionate, and even loving side of this impossible to categorize character.  As for Isolda Dychauk, she hits it out of the park as Lucrezia.  She displays all the Borgia character complexities coupled with wisdom, mercy, and in her capacity for strategic thought, actually surpasses her brother and father.  She quickly matures from being a helpless, childish pawn in her father's scheming to a strong, independent and wise beyond her years leader in her own right.  I always had a historical ""crush"" on Lucrezia, who seemed to embody beauty, sweetness, intellect, and cunning, and Dychauk hits all the right notes with her acting, manner, and beauty.  Even supporting characters are complex and engaging, and I liked the fact they're generally played by actors of the approximate age as the characters themselves.  As someone who's a stickler for historical costuming accuracy, it rivals the best historical dramas.  The exteriors are beautiful, and the generous use of natural light and candles for the interior scenes adds a richness and realism that many big budget movies don't do as well.  Many scenes have beautiful sacred period music in them.  The armor and weaponry is also correct for the period.  In short, history buffs of the period should find it has a nice turn of the 16th century feel.  If it hadn't been for several wild plot elements that have no basis in historical fact, I'd have given it five stars.  But in bringing the Borgia trio and their times to life in an entertaining and informative way, I think it does a superb job.",1448582400,,2456,5.130653266331659

4989410,3,B006HFXFAY,"We've only watched three episodes.  On the plus side, if this is remotely accurate historically, it's unbelievable how depraved life was in 1492 Rome, and it's a good history lesson.  You can see why Machiavelli wrote what he did - somebody needed to establish order.  The costumes and settings are beautiful, although some of the scenery depicting Rome from afar is obviously not real.  On the minus side, the mix of accents is disconcerting.  Rodrigo has an American accent, there are British, Italian and possibly Hungarian accents mixed in also.  The acting is not the greatest.  The actors are often sweating, so then why are they wearing those heavy velvet outfits?",1437523200,,671,4.990990990990991

4989431,1,B006HFXFAY,"I admit that before watching this I saw the Showtime version so I may be a little biased. But I love Italian history and was curious to see how a different director would interpret the same historical events.

 I am totally ok with how these actors look and I don't care whether they look like the historical portraits or not, so for me it is not really a matter of who is the best Pope  Jeremy Irons or John Doman?, but it was more like What on Earth is this?!.

The pilot starts with a map of Italy and a monotonous voice describing the political situation of the moment. A bit too obvious, but ok, why not. But what follows seems like a chain of poorly connected short scenes, mostly of unexplained violence and passionless but very graphic sex. The whole thing mostly resembles a rehearsal of a school play where instead of proper dialogues actors loudly and flatly read paragraphs from a history books . Many people here criticize the accents, but the main problem is not really the accents  it is the weird way the lines are delivered  no emotions, no drama, no feeling behind them, no connection to the actions. Are they even real actors? For example, the actress who plays Vanozza seems to uncontrollably laugh all the time when she speaks.

Characters motivations are almost absent for some reason  no built-up, no development, nothing to explain why they do what they do. Why does Cesare cut off that guys fingers? Why Lucrezia is always yelling at Giulia? Looks like the authors just wanted to put as many things as possible in each scene, not bothering with any development or revealing dialogues.

Peoples feelings are not shown through cinematographic means, but are bluntly stated by the actors, almost turning to the camera and flatly pronouncing something like, literally: I am suffering, because I want what my brother has. Seriously?! Compare how the same jealousy was expressed in the Showtime version  very subtle, slowly building up, a glance, a teasing word Hey,  you have a whole arsenal of cinematographic means to show and express things, so why with all that budget and beautiful costumes do you make an amateurish school play with boring lines, bad lightning, no varying or interesting camera angles, no drama and unnatural and wooden actors?

Also, the gore factor. I am not a hypocrite, I love European cinema and I am against over-glossing and excessive glamourizing, but this was too much even for me. Of course those were cruel and dirty times, but why do sex/blood/feces take up about 80 percent of screen time? Why not balance them a little with something beautiful and nice to look at? Also, why make the sex scenes so un-erotic and unattractive? Seems like the authors just wanted to put naked bodies (especially breasts) in every scene, even where no sex was involved: breastfeeding a dying Pope - ???!, Cesare threatening the witch with no sexual subtext whatsoever suddenly touching her nipples  why??? And where there was no possibility to put naked breasts, it had to be compensated with an unexpected brutal fight and lots of blood.

As the authors overdid with sex and grisliness, they also overdid with the evilness of characters. There is literally no-one you can root for in this show, everyone seems pretty much one-sided, downright selfish jerks, ready to sell or kill anyone at the first possibility. Of course they were no angels, but the audience needs to prove some positive emotions too while watching, not only disgust Also,  as I already said, the feelings expressed by the actors seem so unfounded and not believable that it makes it even harder to feel any sympathy for them.

I really wanted to like this show because the historical material is so rich and interesting, but after watching 2 episodes of this and struggling (in vain) to find anything remotely attractive or captivating, I gave up, sorry  Maybe they just wanted to put too many events and shocking details in the first two episodes to attract certain type of viewers, and after that it gets more reasonable, coherent and gripping, and dialogues and acting start to make sense?",1419811200,2,4100,4.809388335704125

4989446,5,B006HFXFAY,"For me, it is impossible to try to compare Borgia and The Borgias.  Both are excellent and aside from the subject matter, very different.  I first watched The Borgias and absolutely loved it.  I stumbled upon this presentation and thanks to some informative reviews, I had to leap - and so glad I did.

In some other reviews, much has been made about the ""accent issue,"" most specifically John Doman's American accent.  Because his accent is so different from that of the other actors, I did notice it initially, but after half an hour or so, it didn't matter at all.  In fact, I thought John Dorman did an excellent job portraying Rodrigo Borgia and looked so much more like him as well.

As in The Borgias, great detail was taken in costuming and set detail.  And, in some of the retelling of stories based in murky facts, some liberties were also taken.  Borgia requires much more viewer participation, I think, because there are more characters to keep up with. One thing that struck me about Borgia is how the film-makers portrayed the people, cast and extras.  There were men and women of all sizes and physical descriptions.  There was tremendous realism in Borgia, all the way through.

After watching The Borgias, it took me a minute to ""accept"" the actors in Borgia, as I am so fond of the ones in the former.  What allowed me to enjoy Borgia equally is that these two series are SO completely different.  Each one stands by itself and should be appreciated that way.  These characters are so interesting and both gave me a completely different understanding and appreciation for the Borgias and their times.

If you are intrigued by the Borgia family, I recommend BOTH versions of their story.  Each paints a different view of the same story and makes a highly entertaining experience in the bargain.",1415491200,11,1811,4.698412698412699

4989452,4,B006HFXFAY,"I have watched both versions of Borgia's, this version and the Showtime version. I will say that I liked this version, but I loved the Showtime version. This version had a different story line than THE Borgia's, and I liked that. So if you have watched THE Borgia's and are wondering if you will be bored with this version, I don't think you will, the storyline is different enough to keep you watching. The acting in this version is nothing compared to THE Borgias. I couldn't stand Lucrezia for the first season and half of the second, and a lot of the scenes with Cesare and Rodrigo are way too over dramatized (that is, their acting is a bit much). I do like that we get to know Alessandro Farnese in this version, but his sister Giulia (the Pope's mistress) is annoying. I loved the female trio in THE Borgias and was disappointed to see that Giulia did not get along with ANYONE other than her own family and Rodrigo. I disliked the costumes in this version as well, just look at the crosses that the Cardinals wear, in this version they look like FAKE rubies glued on a spray painted cross, and in THE Borgias the Cardinals crosses looked amazing. (That is just an example of the wardrobe) The girl that plays Lucrezia in this version can't act either. The only thing she can really do is move her lips around a BUNCH, which was distracting and annoying. Obviously I liked it enough to give it 4 stars, it is worth watching. Get through the first season and it starts to get better, the acting and storyline starts to pick up in season 2! In fact, at the end of season 2 I found myself very anxious for season 3. I am hoping they have some more Lucrezia/Cesare scenes. We hardly have any of those so far and I love their chemisty (in BOTH versions) So I recommend watching both versions. If you haven't watched any version, I suggest watching this one first and then the showtime version. Just a suggestion. Happy watching! :)",1407283200,,1933,4.447887323943662

4989466,2,B006HFXFAY,"I know I'm never going to be fully happy with the veracity of these historical shows; occasionally they (some more often than not) throw in some historical analysis that is stimulating and intriguing. Borgia is no exception -- it isn't all correct, nor is it grievously incorrect. I am enjoying the reviews, however, of those who feel more intellectual because they hate Showtime's version and love this one -- that is delightful.

Lets not forget, though, why these shows exist: to entertain. And in that sense, Borgia does not compare to Showtime's The Borgias. For one, it is terribly cast. Why they cast John Doman, who is better suited for cops, cowboys, and Wall Street roles, I'm sure I do not know. He brings a brash John Wayne flavor to a character that should be refined, oily, and suavely intelligent. Let's not even get into his accent. No wait, let's do, let's talk about accents.

Lucrezia Borgia has a Russian accent, Vanozza has a Spanish accent, Juan has a French accent, and Cesare has an English accent. And then, Rodrigo blusters in with his heartland American accent. If they were trying to entertain and present this as a polished, worthy piece of cinema, and European historical drama, then they failed by fault of distracting the watcher with the cornucopia of accents they threw in. It sounds haphazard, unplanned, lacking in quality...more like a community theater than a first class production. The casting director and the production director might have collaborated more on how to smooth this out. It's one thing to have a cast of English accents on Italian characters, or Pidgin Chinese on any and all Asian characters, but it's entirely another thing to go all willy-nilly and declare that anything goes. If they cared so much about the sets and costumes (which they clearly did), why wasn't the same effort put into the delivery of lines? Hire actors who can do an accent other than their own -- they're out there in abundance. At least then, you'd have a more believable family.

Next, let talk about the casting of Cesare Borgia. Contemporary portraits show him to be swarthy, lush, and hyper-masculine in appearance. Accounts of his behavior portray his behavior as brutal, ruthless, rebellious without excuse. Yet they've cast Mark Ryder -- delicate and effeminate in appearance with his thin-lipped, dainty mouth, his beady, squinty, blue eyes, blond hair, and porcelain, library-rat complexion. Worst of all, and least believable, is that this character is dishonest and cruel in a far more weasely, obsequious fashion than one should expect of Cesare Borgia. A submissive to his far more domineering brother, Juan. Mark Ryder is nothing to behold, a mere to androgynous cherub trying to play one of the most savage men in Italian history. Just another sad example of someone's crush getting in the way of judicious cast selection.

Finally, the cheesy dialogue. If you don't already get what I mean by that, then we might just disagree and there's no sense in elucidating.

There were things to enjoy about this show, as I said, but the inconsistencies, bad casting, and plain disregard for the audience's sagacity ruined it. Two stars for wonderful sets and costumes.

Note: I entered this review before, only to be set upon by angry fandom members having meltdowns, taking it personally because I didn't love this show, and demanding that I acknowledge their disappointment in my verdict. How cute. SO, to all who really love this show, and who take my review as a personal attack on your taste: your need to control is not my problem. I'm here to give MY opinion for this show. YOUR opinion of this show, or indeed your opinion of my opinion, is none of my business. I do not feel the need to justify my review to you, or to watch this show again so that I may fall more in line with your thinking. Just telling you now, so you know that while you're free to throw a tantrum in reply to my review, you are not entitled to my concern or to my response.

4989467,1,B006HFXFAY,"If your the kind of person that needs a director to go to great lengths to show you why you should respect the characters, love them, hate them, etc etc, then you'll hate this show. If your imagination is vivid and you can easily fall in line with whatever you are watching without questioning the plot, then you'll love this show.

Poor Acting:
Perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen on a large scale series. There are plenty of moments where it feels like your watching the bloopers but your not. Not to mention, so many situations are forced. Forced tears, forced sadness, forced joy, the actors do a terrible job at switching from one emotion to the next.

There are numerous Americans on the show who are speaking with absolutely NO attempted European accents of any kind, that includes the main character. Everyone around him is using an italian, British, spanish, or danish, accent yet himself and one other Cardinal speak like their straight from Boston. I got over that after a while, but if your a history nut it would be hard to.

Violence and Gore:
Far more violent and graphic than it needs to be. There are shows that have been more violent but they allow the plot to justify it much better than this one.

The other version with Jeremy Irons is on a completely different plane. You cannot compare the two. I loved that show. This one was quite possibly the worst series I have every watched of all time. Its only saving grace was that the character Giulia Farnese might have the best buttocks every filmed on camera. After you get the opportunity to see it, stop watching this show.",1395014400,5,1613,4.570934256055363
4989468,3,B006HFXFAY,"After watching every episode of The Borgias and being disappointed to find out it was canceled, I thought I would give this European production a try.

I am amazed by how many people think it compares favorably to The Borgias. There is one thing that simply ruins this version as a serious competitor to the Showtime version: THE ACTING AND WRITING IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

Borgia is just not as compelling. I was particularly disappointed with John Doman, who was great on the wire but seems uncomfortable and wooden in the role of Rodrigo Borgia. Many of the supporting cast are also quite weak, including the roles of Giulia Farnesi and Lucrezia Borgia. The writing for the show as a whole is unnatural and contrived, with an overly-complex sentence structure and too much forced exposition worked in for our benefit.

That's it. All the whining about the accents? Come on, who cares? Having everyone speak in the Queen's English as in the Showtime series is no more accurate that this version, displaying badly accented English from all over Europe AND an American Pope.

This version of the show features much more graphic depictions of violence and sex. I read a blogger on the DailyKos describe this as ""more authentic"" because Americans are afraid of sexualized sex. I don't know about that. I think it is these elements which lead the other reviewers, more than anything else, to praise this show as more historically accurate. While the violence in this version can be almost stomach-turning, it was indeed a dark time in history at the same time that the Renaissance was hitting its stride. Given that, I don't really hold it against the show that they are using sex and violence to the best of their ability, but would it be too much to ask for them to have tightened down on the quality of the acting?

As a final aside, I've heard some say that Borgia's casting gave some importance to finding people who LOOK similar to the images we have of the actual historical characters. If true, I think that was a mistake which becomes plain when one sees the terrible acting. Jeremy Irons may look nothing like the historical pontiff, but he was able to play the character expertly. The Borgias' Rodrigo was a deeply flawed character who lusted for power, loved his family, struggled with his faith, did evil deeds, but still somehow seemed likable and human. John Doman's Rodrigo Borgia is woodenly acted, seems not to understand his own motivation, and seems cold and inauthentic. That's a fatal flaw when comparing these two shows.",1394150400,2,2540,4.803203661327231

Have fallen asleep at some point during them all.

NOT the case with the Canal/Tom Fontana version. The show is riveting, draws you in, holds you captive and makes you feel a part of the history and the story. Frankly, I find all the complaints about historical accuracy tiresome. It is entertainment. Not a lesson. If I wanted a lesson I would read a book or watch a documentary. That said, this version is SO realistic and engrossing you forget you're watching a TV show. John Doman's accent (while out of place at first) grows on you because his acting is so superb and so ""real"". He truly becomes Rodrigo Borgia. The real show stopper is Mark Ryder as Cesare. All I can say is WOW. This up and comer is in a class all his own. He is exactly how I always imagined Cesare to be!!! He truly does the character (both real and contrived) justice and again, you forget you're watching a TV show. I felt like I was really peering back at history in the making.

He is painful to watch and worse to listen to. It makes one wonder if he even understands what the lines he is delivering actually mean. He brings a new meaning to the word ""wooden"". His fellow cast is not much better. The international cast all speak English in their native tongues---accents that are in some cases, almost impossible to understand.

In a medium like television, where even a serial killer can be made into a sympathetic character, they definitely didn't try to do that with the Borgais clan. The thing that kept me coming back (beside having watched everything netflix had to offer) was trying to figure out which member of this family was the most repugnant. Cesare; doing his ""bull in a China shop"" with everything and everyone who he thinks is getting in the way of his goal of.....? Who knows, he didn't. Was it the pope? Who cared far more in feeding his wants than the souls of the people. Lucratia? Who went through life thinking she was a fairy princess, and just assumed the world agreed. Or Juan, whose character was written as more of an afterthought. Personally, I'm going with the daughter.
I've read how much better this series is compared to the Showtime series. I'll have to take their word for it, but this is atrocious. While the set, costumes and locations are beautiful, the dialogue, cast choice and acting leaves much to be desired. Having watched John Dorman in the wire, I was left thinking he must have had something else on his mind when doing this role. His deadpan delivery was so phone in bland, it seemed like he was doing his lines to allow the other actors to do theirs, it sounded like he was reading them off the script for the first time while shooting. He was really bad, by far the worse of the bunch. The actor that played Cesare had a false intensity that I found difficult to watch. There were scenes where I thought ""are they trying to do this? "" at times it seemed like a parody of itself.
After Juan was killed, the pope was locked in his room, smashing things around and wailing; it was hilarious. It sounded so fake, like a petulant teenager making as big a scene as possible, while doing it behind close doors so it didn't look like they're trying to get attention. There's another scene where two men, the ex-husband and the other a love interest for Lucretia. She's in her bed when her ex comes in to tell her he still loves her. She throws him out, and less than 5 second later, the other comes in to do the same. The scene was so contrived, it was laughable.
There wasn't one character who wasn't a complete self serving scum bag in the whole show, not a shred of integrity (with the exception of one monk, who was tortured and killed for it, no good deed goes unpunished). It reminded me of those action cartoons, where the bad guy would say things like, ""by all that is evil, I will..... "". Everyone had to say out loud what they planned on doing next. I find this type of dialog is put in because the writers don't think their audience would be able to figure it out if they don't telegraph everything for us.

4989505,5,B006HFXFAY,"This show took me completely by surprise, especially after reading a bunch of negative reviews here and in other places. Most of them, it seems, are written by people who saw one or two episodes and quickly dismissed it as a complete disaster and inferior to the other Borgia show produced by Neil Jordan for Showtime. Well, I'm happy to report, that my own opinion is quite different. The first episodes did take some getting used, particularly the mishmash of various accents, clunky exposition, overabundance of supporting characters and political details and an unexpected approach to character development of younger Borgias (particularly Cesare - he seems to be really polarizing for many viewers). Also, compared to the polished Showtime version, which I saw first, it seemed somewhat gloomy and even drab.

However, there was something that made me keep watching. Even though I was far from expert on the Borgias, I recognized it was much better researched than the Showtime version, both in terms of historical events and a look and feel of times. The political intrigues were actually quite interesting and I was also curious to see how they were going to do with Cesare - can this volatile teenager really transform into a credible prototype for Machiavelli's The Prince? Then, after the first 3 or 4 episodes I was suddenly hooked and tried to glom the rest of the series as fast as I possibly could in one sitting. It's a good thing both seasons are available on Netflix now! Although I admit, it wasn't until season 2 when I realized I was watching the best adult historical show since Rome, and possibly my favorite period drama ever (I think Mark Ryder's fantastic performance as a more mature Cesare Borgia in season 2 has something to with that, too). But I promise I'll try to contain this review to season 1 as much as I can.

Performances range from adequate to great (my favorites are Mark Ryder and Isolda Dychauk). Most people will probably recognize John Doman and Art Malik as well as guest actors from The Game of Thrones. The Borgia children and other youngsters are closer to the actual age of their characters in 1492, when Rodrigo was elected Pope. Isolda is more believable as a childlike Lucrezia, and Mark and Stanley Weber (Juan) as young adults. They grow together with their characters as the series progresses. They even resemble the portraits from the era quite a bit.

John Doman (Rodrigo) seems to be a deal breaker for many, especially his American accent. Which seems rather strange to me: why do we expect people in medieval Italy speak with posh British accent (which is not used by most Brits, by the way). In fact, the American accent even stresses Rodrigo's position as an outsider, a brash barbarian in the more refined culture. Doman might not be my first choice to play the Borgia patriarch but he does bring commanding presence expected of someone who's been a second man in the Vatican for several decades while patiently waiting for his own turn. I only wish the writers had given him more opportunities to display fatherly affection towards his children.

Mark Ryder is given the most challenging role in the series, and he's doing it amazingly well for such a young actor. In season one, Cesare is a very complex character confronted with many issues and goes from one extreme to another, torn between his own dreams of glory and a need to prove to his father than he's more worthy of his love than his brother Juan. He needs to learn to leash his aggression, pride and arrogance in a way that will help his ambitions rather than hinder them. I think it's rather bold on Tom Fontana's part to remind us that Cesare is still 18 when his father becomes Pope and not to make him a badass right away, but rather an impulsive young man with great potential who still has to find his way in life. Some might consider it's a weakness, but I believe it allows for far more interesting character development (especially since season 2 delivers in spades). We have to wait for Season 3 for the final verdict, but it's the best portrayal of a young man's rise to power I've seen on TV so far.

This show also features a surprising number of supporting roles, most of whom are based on actual historic personalities and have their own backstory (although they do play loose with some of them). All of them contribute to the story and look like real people with their own agendas rather than simply plot devices. There're even personas - like Spain's monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella and the German Emperor - that never actually show up on screen, but nevertheless influence the politics of Rome quite a bit.

I realize the main characters on the show might be hard to empathize with if you expect to find them to be likable in a traditional sense. While they're not the monsters from the Borgia legend (they do address some juicy gossip such as incest and poisonings), they're complex characters who fight their inner demons (Cesare is the most obvious example, but it's true to some extent with others). The writers are not afraid to give them unbecoming qualities such as petty jealousy or vanity or put them into embarrassing situations. And of course, most of them accept violence as a method to defend their honor or achieve their political goals far more readily than we do (true to the times, but might be off-putting to some viewers). In the end, I still ended up rooting for Cesare, Lucrezia, Rodrigo and, of course, Giulia's brother Alessandro Farnese who seems to be the only really decent person on the show.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying the show is entirely flawless. I think the first 3 or 4 episodes are really the weakest (they also have the largest amount of gratuitous nudity and violence), although I've come to appreciate them more now since they're actually doing a very good job of setting up the rest of the series. Some of the invented side stories are really over the top, some of the made-up conflicts are too soapy and some of the actors struggle with saying lines in English. I don't mind different accents at all, the only problem is, sometimes it's just hard to understand what they're saying (I had to turn on subtitles on a few occasions). I also wish they had a bigger budget for grander sets (not that they're not doing a great job with what they have). Finally, I think they should've allocated more time to develop Cesare and Lucrezia's relationship more naturally (I felt they threw it in at the last moment because it's what the audience expected). But overall, I firmly believe that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses by far.

So how does this version compare to Showtime? As someone who's seen two season of Borgia and all three of Showtime before actually checking out Camal+ version, I have a few things to say on the matter (but take it as a grain of salt as I'm squarely in Tom Fontana's camp).

I have to say, there're quite a few things to love about Neil Jordan's effort which I actually liked quite a bit. First of all, they do have a substantially bigger budget which allows for more sumptuous (but not particularly accurate) sets and visually stunning costumes. They also set up Cesare and Lucrezia's love story much better and the cast is generally more solid.

On the other hand, Borgia definitely wins in the character development and amount of historical research (I'm not going to say accuracy since they both take significant liberties with the private lives of the characters). Borgia's writers are much better of following the major historical events and showing the political and cultural background of the day (not without some simplification or dramatic license, of course). Despite some anachronisms, Fontana's Borgia actually feels like Renaissance Italy rather than a vaguely historic fantasyland where the characters appear to be too modern and do very little of what their prototypes actually did.

Canal+ version is definitely more challenging of the two and is not an easily digestible entertainment for the casual viewers. It requires at least some basic knowledge of the era, attention to detail, patience when it comes to characters' growth and willingness to look deeper where things are left open to interpretation.

Even though I enjoyed The Borgias when I first saw it I don't really feel like watching it again (ok, maybe only Cesare and Lucrezia scenes). However, I've already watched Borgia's two seasons three times and look forward to season three. Hopefully, unlike Showtime, Canal+ is going to allow for a proper ending to the series.",1376179200,11,8567,4.781081081081081

I am watching for the plot, the production which is richly detailed, and the two gorgeous nephews, Cesare and Juan, Mark Ryder and Stanley Webber, good actors and nice to look at.",1491868800,,788,4.751824817518248

8498328,1,B006HFXFAY,"I wasted my money and want to warn others not to do the same by putting my honest review up here for an absolutely awful show, instead of what I believe are either paid reviews or biased reviews by those involved in producing the show.

This was the all time worst show I have ever watched.

I bought it because on Amazon it was rated with a 4-star average and in IMDB it had a 7.9 star average. But it was awful and a complete waste of money! I don't know who is rating this show highly, maybe the partially comatose actors or the film makers or producers. But don't be fooled and save your money - this show is simply unwatchable.

To summarize, the acting was terribly WOODEN across the board, the dialogue was awful, the characters had no development and portrayed no emotions at all, the plots made no sense, and there was not a single redeeming quality about the show.

More Details: The main actor, John Doman, who plays Rodrigo Borgia / Pope Alexander VI is the most wooden and awful performance I have ever seen. He is absolutely awful. His American accent in the middle of everyone else being European is also jarring. But if his acting were decent, it could be overlooked. But his acting was not only not decent, it was completely wooden acting.

The dialogue was also bad and boring. There was no character to the characters. There was no build up to the plot. The other actors were also boring and shallow. There were no emotions portrayed and no drama at all. Just lots of wooden acting. The plots made little sense the way they were portrayed with no connection from one event to another. Even the camera work was amateur.

I wanted to like this show, I really did, because period shows are my favorite and there are too few of them out there because they are expensive to produce. I tried so very hard to like this show, watched another episode and yet another just to see if it got any better. But it never got better and only got worse. The same wooden acting, bad dialogue, plot that made no sense, no character development, terrible filming one episode after another.

Another reviewer said this show looked like a high school play rehearsal. It was worse than that!",1468713600,,2186,4.477386934673367
