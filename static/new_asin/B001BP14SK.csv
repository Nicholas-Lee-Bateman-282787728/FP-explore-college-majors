Soul Reapers come from the afterlife, an alternate dimension known as The Soul Society and it is their job to police our world, bring peace to errant souls, and destroy those back go mad, becoming massive soul-devouring monstrosities known as Hollows.  So basically, the them is a blurring of the line between life and afterlife.  It's chock full of action, sports a cast of characters so massive I can't recall most of their names at any given time, and an extremely complex history and series of rules that it operates by.  These things make ""Bleach"" one of the outstanding ongoing anime series, but they also make it extremely hard on new viewers.  ""Memories of Nobody"" does as good a job as can be expected in welcoming Bleach newcomers, but it will mostly appeal to fans of the television series as an interesting and charming standalone addition to its canon.

The star of the show is a girl named Senna, who Ichigo and Rukia encounter while investigating a creepy phenomena of faceless apparitions gathering in the world of the living.  While humans can see none of this, it is a bad omen of things to come and while the Soul Society researches on their end, Ichigo and Rukia have to attempt to sort things out in the world of the living.  Senna is easily among the most instantly lovable characters in the Bleach pantheon.  She embodies all that is carefree and charming about anime characters.  But while she jerks Ichigo around, the Soul Society comes to a staggering conclusion about her and sends several powerful Captains to take her into custody.  A typically good-hearted and hard-headed Ichigo resists, but before a fight breaks out several powerful and mysterious warriors appear to claim Senna as well.  The end result is a potential cataclysmic collision between the worlds of the living and the dead, eradicating both.  Bleach fans, start your engines.

As with most anime films based on ongoing series', the story is set up not to affect existing continuity in any way.  However, ""Memories of Nobody"" makes for a surprisingly poignant tale.  Bleach usually keeps the tone fairly light and tends to focus on the humor and idiosyncrasies of the characters as well as the perpetually escalating multiple plotlines.  Here, the focus is almost entirely on Ichigo and Senna and their story produces some surprising results. The idea of the blank souls combining and searching for lost memories was both interesting and tragic.  The action is pretty sweet here with ban-kais (powerful attacks used conservatively but spectacularly in the series) being unleashed left-and-right.  Several of the Soul Society's finest make appearances in the climax and show their stuff.  New viewers can either enjoy the eye candy or spend that time saying ""who's that?  And that?  What was that thing she just did?"" and the like.  Lots of little cool character moments -including one between Rukia and her brother, who was once intent on executing her- will be lost on them, but fans will cheer.  The ending was extremely emotional -though a bit confusing- and left me pretty shellshocked which is what really caught me off guard about this film.  I was expecting fluff and got some genuinely moving drama.  Not too shabby.

""Memories of Nobody"" is a definite must-see for fans of the anime, but newcomers would be advised to watch ""Bleach"" at least through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B001ASQ9MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>&nbsp;to know what the hell is going on a lot of the time.  Fans of Chad, Uryu, and Orehime: sorry.  Better luck next time.",1224806400,16,3864,5.257748776508972
3496680,4,B001BP14SK,"I enjoyed Memories of Nobody very much. I thought the story was strong and got back to the kind of elements the show had during the attempt to rescue Rukia. The action and story were well done.  My only regret may be that I didn't get to see it in the thearter. I would recommend it to Bleach fans in the US.

One of the best parts of the special features was seeing the behind the scenes of the show. Especially the voice actors. It always amazes me how the picture you have in your head based on a voice is never anything like the people in real life.

This was a great buy.",1224201600,6,576,4.035087719298246
3496681,4,B001BP14SK,"What needs to be remembered about this movie is: it's an anime movie, and anime movies have a few certain traits that, while annoying, are hard to avoid. Mainly that they bring a new character into the story (usually an ideal ""mary sue"" character), and make the entire plot revolve around them for a few hours, and then they usually die so they can't mess with the canon later on. The worst part about this is how the other characters all develop this hugely detailed relationship with them and start doing things completely out of character (like risking their lives for said character). I understand that this is kind of the only way to deal with filler in general. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

Thankfully for Bleach, this reaction isn't so out of character for Ichigo, who constantly risks his life for random people, and this movie really doesn't go over the top on this point. Now then, on with the review.

This movie is very good: it has humor, angst, action, and an enjoyable plot (especially as filler/anime movies go). My list of highlights: The part at the beginning about what happens when Ichigo just drops his body to go into shinigami (ahem, 'scuse me, ""soul reaper"") form is great. The whole sequence near the end with Kenpachi is marvelous! And the bit with Byakuya is breathtaking, as is any time Senna uses her sword. There are some great cameos of old favorite characters throughout, especially once the plot moves along and Senna's character becomes better defined.

I also have to say that in the dub, Troy Baker, (who does the voice for the main bad guy) has an amazing voice. He really makes the character. The dubbing for all the characters is very good throughout, and the behind-the-scenes parts with the voice actors are great, and well worth buying the DVD for.

This movie also gave the Bleach universe some wonderful new music, especially the track entitled ""Senna"" (think violin). I wouldn't say it raised the bar for Bleach or anime movies in general, but it was worth watching and definitely far from unbearable.",1221350400,,2059,4.711111111111111
3496682,4,B001BP14SK,"Many anime movies based on a TV series are basically like extremely long episodes, though often with with better animation and music.

And such is the case with the first movie based on the hit anime series, ""Bleach: Memories of Nobody."" It's not a perfect movie adaptation -- several regulars are reduced to brief cameos -- but it is graced with some extremely solid action sequences, lovely animation, a solid mix of comedy and tragedy, and a nice little storyline for the perpetually stressed-out Ichigo.

After disposing of a Hollow, Ichigo and Rukia encounter puffy creatures with pointed red heads. When the things start getting pushy, a strange Shinigami girl named Senna appears and wipes many of them out.

Turns out these things are Blank (amnesiac) souls from the Valley of Screams in the Severed World, and the only way to get rid of 'em is to find the Memory Rosary, a being that contains all their memories. As Ichigo struggles to keep an eye on the flighty Senna, he is charged with finding the Memory Rosary and protecting it from the mysterious man who is leading the Blanks.

Guess who the Memory Rosary is. I'll give you a hint: it's someone not in the regular cast.

Anyway, a bunch of Soul Reapers are dispatched to bring the Memory Rosary back with them, only to have her snatched away by a strange man named Ganryu, who has a grudge against the Soul Reapers. Ichigo and Rukia discover the portal into the Severed World -- but there's only an hour before the worlds of the living and the dead collide, with devastating results. And even with the help of all his Soul Reaper friends, Ichigo may not be able to prevail...

Anyone not familiar with Tite Kubo's ""Bleach"" series will probably be utterly lost during ""Memories of Nobody,"" especially given the vast cast of Good Guys who show up without introduction. The entire movie plays out like a very long anime filler episode, but with a lot more new characters, villains, and introducing an entire dimension between the Soul Society and the living world. And an accidental Ichigo-Kon kiss.

Fortunately ""Memories of Nobody"" does a good job preserving the flavor of the ""Bleach"" anime series. It starts off rather lightweight and a bit talk-heavy until Ganryu decides to show himself, leading into a clash between the Soul Reapers and his nasty little minions. Those rapid-fire battles are astounding -- quick, lethal and full of special powers (including Ichigo riding on Renji's zanpakuto). And the climax is simply spectacular -- a bloody savage duel between Ganryu and Ichigo on a vast leafless tree, even as the Severed World starts falling apart.

And the writers strike a good balance in ""Memories of Nobody"" -- we have acrobatic battles, flashy powers, a bit of Hollow-slaying, and some poignant moments for Ichigo and Senna. Fortunately amid all this serious stuff, there's some humor as well -- including a running gag about ambulance crews trying to resuscitate Ichigo's soulless body, which he has a bad habit of simply dropping any old place. I've always wanted to see that happen.

Even the animation has been souped-up here. It's a little more detailed and defined than animation for a weekly TV show, and there are some lovely visuals -- sprays of maple leaves, the nighttime lights of Karakura, and the explosive battles between Soul Reapers. And the soundtrack -- particularly the violin solo -- is simply lovely.

The characterization is one weak spot, though. Most of the main cast -- including Uryu, Chad, Orihime and all of Urahara's little gang -- are reduced to standing on a bridge waiting for Ichigo to come back. And somehow Ganryu is never quite compelling -- we never find out why he was exiled, or what motivations he has beyond wanting revenge on the Soul Society.

But this is a well-written story for Ichigo Kurosaki, -- his gruff, slightly awkward personality is captured beautifully, as well as his iron-clad determination to protect anybody he's become fond of. Senna is a character so completely flaky that she makes Orihime look like Eeyore, but she does manage to be likable and good-hearted despite that.

""Bleach: Memories of Nobody"" is not quite as good as it could have been, but it's a solid adventure for Ichigo and his assorted Soul Reaper friends. An entertaining, fast-paced little ride.",1219017600,33,4307,4.868852459016393
3496683,5,B001BP14SK,"I feel this is the second best Bleach movie (the best being Fade To Black). The story is good and most all of the characters are in this movie at one time or another. This is one story that I feel touched Ichigo's heart. It also expands on the relationship between the world of the living and the world of the soul reapers. It shows how much everyone is willing to support Ichigo in his decisions and time of need. Great battle scenes as well. A very good story overall and definitely to be added to your collection.

The action was decent, but there wasn't enough in this film imo. The whole movie seemed to focus on Senna and Ichigo running around. BORING! The final scene was okay, the banished clan got defeated quite to fast, which was stupid since they didn't even have much screentime. This movie is blah.",1323129600,,616,4.318965517241379

Though It has that Shojo feel leading up to the Shonen, it could have been kind of mixed together as they did in bleach season one, instead of putting one after the other. Not the best anime movie but not the worst.",1248825600,,424,4.108433734939759

3496738,4,B001BP14SK,This was a decent movie for those of you who haven't ever seen Bleach before.  Diehard fans may be a little disappointed simply because you're too involved with the series.  Lighten up this one is okay.,1234396800,,202,4.583333333333333
3496739,3,B001BP14SK,"My multi-disabled adult son wanted it. He was happy with it. Personally, I don't agree with a lot of what''s out today and this anime has guys with long spiked hair (the Bible says that it is a shame for a man to have long hair. Also ones wearing womans jewelry like earings, bracelets and necklaces is a symbol of homosexuality on men. Violence, etc. and attitudes have given my son a manner of disagreeing with laws and saying it's okay to break them if you dnt like them. These type movies should be banned",1234051200,,509,4.368421052631579

8284017,5,B001BP14SK,This could have easily been the title of the Fade to Black Bleach movie; they both had a similar premise of missing individuals.  As usual the animation in the Bleach movies is top notch and worthy of the purchase.,1405468800,,214,4.487179487179487
