7119795,4,B00W3W2QGE,"Samuel (Cuba Goodling jr. ) and his family are seeking freedom on the Underground Railroad in 1856. They are aided by Thomas Garrett (Michael Goodwin) and a host of Quakers who don't care that they are breaking the Fugitive Slave Act. A man named Plimpton (William Sadler) has been hired to find and return the family to the Richmond Plantation. Along the way they meet Frederick Douglas (Byron Utley).

In a subplot, a century earlier, Samuel's great-grandfather is being brought over as a slave by John Newton (Bernhard Forcher) who would later renounce slave trading and write ""Amazing Grace."" His conversion is not an accurate representation, which occurred while his ship was en route to Ireland, but this version makes better drama and inspiration.

The acting was low key. The performances while solid, were not outstanding. This is an inspiring emotional film about hope and redemption.  ""Family Approved""",1434153600,5,913,5.155405405405405

We will never be able to comprehend  greatness of suffering individual people went through, we can just try and will never be close to it. But we can comprehend that grace and understanding can exist in hearts of people of every creed if they have heart to begin with.

There is light shining on the darkness in this world because of Jesus Christ in, through and all around those who belong to him. These tormented yet precious souls will be rewarded in heaven. I am inspired and encouraged to continue to pray for this movie to reach everyone it is meant to. Although a movie, it is inspired by true events. Just as the Crucifixion of Christ is almost impossible for me to truly comprehend, the suffering of all slaves throughout history is hard for me to comprehend. Yet as I watch these stories played out, interestingly during black history month, I am keeping my focus on praying for the human trafficking situation and slavery still here on earth. And according to reported statistics, at an all time high. Shocking! I absolutely loved this movie. The music is lovely. The characters so soulful. Thank you to all who had a hand in this movie.",1519603200,,941,4.607142857142857
7119832,1,B00W3W2QGE,"This is a pitiful excuse for a film. To start the depiction they try to paint that white slave masters cared about the slaves they were bringing to the western world is so wrong. In one of the scenes several slaves had died on the trip coming to America and they show the slave masters in a sad state and actually giving them a funeral of some sort. This is so irresponsible because they are tying to show that white slave owners cared for the humans that they were forcefully taking. There is no such thing as a nice slave owner lets be very clear. If you will tell the story tell the whole story truthfully. Slave catchers-buyers were not gentle, remorseful or kind. Im overall annoyed with this movie for its inaccuracies and all its not so subtle cultural appropriation. Lastly, the end of the movie was a stretch beyond measures there is no way a slave catcher, on his death bed wishes a runaway slave good luck and gives them money. This film was poorly written and I am very disappointed if you couldn't tell. I wish there was a -2 star option.",1519430400,,1051,4.394871794871795

7119834,2,B00W3W2QGE,"Pretty awful movie. Was a great story, with good bones, ruined by terrible dialogue, atrocious and predictable directing, and absolutely no creativity except for weaving a few songs in, and ridiculously historically inaccurate.  Which adds the question, was this supposed to be a music of sorts? Cuba Gooding Jr. was given nothing to work with, and even he looked like a terrible actor with his boring lines. The ONLY redeeming value to this movie and for why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that Jubilant Sykes sings twice (best voice in the world), and possibly also because I learned about the underground railroad somewhat, though not sure I can trust anything given how much they botched John Newton (someone I know a lot about).",1519171200,,736,4.7952755905511815

7119845,1,B00W3W2QGE,"This white person can't believe anyone would think this is an accurate portrayal of life for black people on the plantations of colonial America or the dangers they faced in their pursuit of freedom. Maybe it happens to have some factual basis, but for me, it's just an embarrassment.

This entire film is nothing more than a romanticized, twisted tale of life as a slave. It is an attempt to ease the conscience of white people, as if to say that life wasn't really so bad. Isn't it bad enough that we are educated with watered down facts as young children in a public school system?

The foundation of the United States was built on the backs of black people. Let's honor them and their descendants with a brutally honest film, not an uplifting musical.",1518998400,,755,4.5851851851851855

7119853,2,B00W3W2QGE,"Much of the dialog was stilted. Poor character development, especially Cuba Gooding Jr. character, Samuel. Most of the white characters appeared to be caricatures of stereotypes that present day viewers hold of southern contemporaries. The accents of the actors need work. The lack of appropriate colloquialisms and dialects in the script didn't help. Several historical oversights occurred the most obvious being that several of the hymns that were sung, weren't written until after the Civil War, and Amazing Grace wasn't put to that tune until 1835. In the movie, Newton sang it at his wedding. The movie also lacked attention to detail. In several closeups of the pistols, there were no percussion caps on the nipples of the revolvers.
Despite these flaws, I found the story to be uplifting. It is a story of redemption and faith, that anyone can find salvation. That true freedom is not earned or won, but is the free gift of God, grace. With a good rewrite, and better direction it could have been a good movie.",1518307200,,1017,4.9186046511627906

7119865,4,B00W3W2QGE,"I enjoyed the dual storyline separated by several generations of history, and also enjoyed the musical aspects of the film.  Well-acted and fact-based, the film tells the story of a family escaping slavery through the underground railroad with a secondary storyline of the man's great-grandfather's journey into slavery when he was just a lad on John Newton's ship (the writer of the beloved hymn Amazing Grace).  One enjoyable moment in the film is a unique arrangement of ""Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior"" that made me smile.  I highly recommend the film.",1517184000,2,554,5.0

7119873,1,B00W3W2QGE,"While I imagine it was the film maker's intent to inspire and edify people of faith, the movie itself in about as historically inaccurate as it possibly could be.  They have characters singing hymns that weren't even written for another 100 years- they use weapons and coins that appear to be from the 1970's, and all the characters seem to be comical caricatures of real people. Most appalling is the white wash treatment of Newton's time in slave trading- even Newton himself has to be rolling over in his grave at the sugary innocence with which his character is portrayed. He was a ruthless slave trader and to picture him going below decks to help feed a young slave boy who refused to eat is a blasphemous portrayal of men who's deeds deserve to be remembered by history as utterly and irredeemably wicked (not that the men themselves can't be redeemed, but their deeds should not be sugar-coated to lull white Christians into thinking slavery was more inconvenient to the black man than it was evil).  Beyond that, this movie tries to make heroes out of the very people responsible for the lightly portrayed horror of chattel slavery; it's a slap in the face to the truth.  This story is pure fantasy masquerading as a historical film.",1516060800,7,1242,4.714285714285714

7119889,1,B00W3W2QGE,"Three things have been appropriated to lend this movie legitimacy- Cuba Gooding Jr., Frederick Douglas, and the underground railroad. But this movie is about excusing 'God fearing Christians"" for their role in slavery, with a special focus on John Newton, a slave trader who converted to Christianity and later became an evangelist.  The  truth is that the institution of slavery was upheld by church-going, god-fearing citizens of Christian nations.  In fact, John Newton continued to participate in slave trade long after he had converted, a thing for which he is widely criticized. It is only in his retirement (when others had already raised their voices) that he himself became an abolitionist.  It is true that he was imprisoned in West Africa by a slave dealer in his younger years, but he did not consider himself an equal to the slaves with whom he was held captive. He thought it unthinkable that he should be treated ""like a slave"" as his character revealingly says in the movie.  But unlike in the movie, it was decades before he spoke out against the injustices of his trade. This movie whitewashes a horrific personal history and by association, through other events in the story, that of an entire religion. Someone else should re-write it for historical and, most importantly, moral accuracy.",1514419200,7,1308,5.009216589861751

The music is moving and emotional particularly the songs sung by Jubilant Sykes including A City Called Heaven and Motherless Child.

7119910,4,B00W3W2QGE,"Freedom is a pretty great movie.  It's certainly moving and certainly reveals the struggles African Americans had to endure during the years of slavery, but not quite the masterpiece I thought it'd be.  I think my biggest gripe is all the singing.  Quite often story segments are interrupted to allow one of the slaves to break out into a song, and while I understand it's done to help the slaves escape the harsh world they're living in and find solace, it feels a little tacky to me.

The story is told decently.  It's actually two stories blended together.  One story is that, in 1856, Cuba Gooding Jr. and his family are lucky to find the underground railroad to take them up north where the quakers are there to offer support, and the second story involves Cuba's grandfather as a slave on a ship by Captain John Newton back in the mid 1700's.  This is the story that involves most of the singing.

Both are inspirational stories.  We see John Newton (played by Bernhard Forcher) who doesn't initially think much of God's existence, only to end up believing when a huge storm rolls in and his fellow shipmen -along with the slaves- are barely able to survive it.  Thanks to support from one of his slaves, Daniel J. Watts, and his undeniable belief in God, Bernhard has a change of heart.  This is a touching part of the story, as is the little boy who's nursed back to health.

Meanwhile, many years later in the mid 1800's, William Sadler is hunting for Cuba's family out in the woods, but he doesn't believe in killing unlike his two ruthless partners who think all colored people should be killed.  No, William just wants to locate the slaves and bring them in, but unfortuntaely for him Cuba and his family are able to escape (for a little while that is).

This movie stays away from using any racist words (well except for one big instance later on that leads to a shooting segment) and for the most part avoids showing any of the slaves being beaten on (again, except for one or two scenes).  This movie really lives up to its name.  These slaves head north to the Mason Dixon line (which is 20 minutes from my house!) and continuing north to New York and Canada to create a new life there.  Along the way they have to deal with and avoid William and his men.

Speaking of the Mason Dixon line, another portion of the story that feels out of place is the stage theater segment.  Wow is this really weird!  I didn't realize people acted this way in the mid 1800's, haha.  I guess looking back I shouldn't be surprised.  I'm aware theater existed back then- just surprised it happened the way it's written in the movie.  These people are acting goofy!  Could have been exaggerated less.

So yeah, great movie either way.  The abundance of singing is a bit much to take since it's out of place (pretty sure the whites wouldn't allow their slaves to sing while standing right next to them on a ship- pretty unrealistic there) but it's nothing really bad since these moments are usually short.  However there is one important thing to note here- this movie reveals where the song ""Amazing Grace"" originated so that's pretty awesome.  Right when I was about to say I've had enough of that song too (and there *were* moments I was thinking ""No please, don't sing it again!"")  But now that I know the history behind the song, it's okay it played so much.

Basically Freedom takes elements of slavery and sort of rushes through it to focus on the actual freedom of the slaves.  You have slaves hiding, getting whipped and mistreated, etc, but it's really brief.  Oddly we barely ever see the slaves working the fields.  The movie as a whole is less than 90 minutes which is short.  The emphasis here are the two stories showing an inspirational take on slaves overcoming the odds and the whites showing remorse, but told in different ways.  For that I recommend it.  Otherwise the acting is really good as you'd expect.",1481673600,,3922,4.54493580599144

7119919,2,B00W3W2QGE,"Since his Academy Award victory for Jerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr.s career as a leading man has been patchy, at best. Laughably-terrible Hollywood flops Chill Factor, Boat Trip and Dirty led to a series of straight-to-video fare, like End Game, Hero Wanted, Line Watch, Hardwired, Ticking Clock and Sacrifice. Those generic titles, resembling mid-1990s Mark Dacascos films (Sanctuary anyone?), speak for themselves: the poor guys career, save for a few minor supporting turns in Hollywood flicks, has been on a steady decline. Unfortunately, his latest starring vehicle, Freedom  which he also executive produced  gives little sign of a much-needed comeback for the once-inspired actor.

The feature-length debut of Peter Cousins, known mostly for his role as Luke Carlyle on the obscure 1980s soap Sons and Daughters, Freedom was also written by Timothy A. Chey, whose credits sure strike a pattern: Impact: The Passion of the Christ, David and Goliath, Final: The Rapture I have absolutely nothing against religious beliefs, nor have I seen any of Cheys films, but this whole project gives off a mild riff of propaganda, the similar kind witnessed in the recent array of faith-based creatively bankrupt pictures (see: God Is Not Dead), driven by a forceful moral message, aimed at specific groups of religious fanatics, most of whom have no appreciation of true cinema. Thats not to say Freedom lacks any semblance of creative ambition  its certainly earnest and pretty to look at  it just constantly steps wrong, displaying an evident absence of filmmaking proficiency, screenwriting prowess and, as a result, originality, laying on its goodwill message way too thick.

The film jumps incoherently between two disparate storylines. The first, taking place in 1856, sees Cuba Gooding Jr. sleepwalking through his role as Samuel who, along with his family, attempts to escape from the Monroe foundation in Virginia, assisted on their way by the Underground Railroad, a secret organization that helped slaves flee to Canada. A potentially-fascinating and harrowing journey is rendered monotonous and clich-ridden, led by indifferent performances, with the sole exceptions of William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption), who almost saves this storyline with his sneering, impassioned portrayal of Plimpton, a morally-torn slave hunter, and the great character actor David Rasche (Burn After Reading), who provides solid, albeit very brief, support as Jefferson Monroe, the owner of the estate from which the Woodward family escaped.

The other storyline, narrated by Samuels mother over a crackling fire, takes place in 1748, and follows John Newtons journey back from Africa; hes the captain of a slave ship, and observes their miserable fates dejectedly (Bernhard Forcher in the role is as wooden as his ship)But its really about how he came up with the song Amazing Grace, and how the song went on to influence millions to drop arms and have faith in humanity. Hallelujah.

To say that the film is riddled with clich would be a gross underestimation. Within the very first minute, there are four glaring ones: the inspired by a true story chestnut; the unnecessary, exceedingly schmaltzy voice-over narration; the thunderous score; the old scrolls, depicting the characters journey with Indiana Jones-style traceable lines

Some memorable bits of dialogue include the following gems: In the smallest of things, I see a glimmer of hope; If I don't come back, I want you to be careful; We must go quickly, theres not much time! Hope can be found in the darkest of places (wait, I thought hope was in the smallest of things?); With forgiveness comes true freedom and, my personal favorite, the somehow wildly inappropriate, My dear, we are slaves to the critics! The words freedom, faith and hope are persistently uttered on so many different occasions, one truly begins to feel like the filmmakers are shoving their doctrine down their throat, as earnest as the directors and screenwriters efforts may be.

Both storylines are regularly disrupted by musical numbers which, though thankfully toned down and avoid the exuberance normally prevalent in musicals, come off as misguided and unfinished, and do nothing to help drive the story or evoke any emotion (if in doubt, just check out Cuba Gooding Jr.s own blank reaction to a particularly over-stretched choral piece). A story like this should be powerful enough on its own merits and does not need to be embellished by such flatulent, oddly contemporary touches.

But Freedoms greatest flaw is its resolute lack of complexity; the film provides no real insight into the origins of slavery or the psychology behind it. It lacks Amistads epic scope, 12 Years A Slaves power and intelligence, and Django Unchaineds humor and drive. The dark irony lies in the fact that the story Freedom tells about the depths of human depravity and prejudice is in itself riddled with stereotypes and sermonizing, rendering it inconsequential, and further tarnishing Cuba Gooding Jr.s ever-fledging resume.",1453334400,,5039,5.270573566084788

7119991,5,B00W3W2QGE,"""Freedom"" illustrated excellent cinematography, as well as story-telling.  There are two stories concurrently displayed, one being a conversion of the writer of the classic hymn ""Amazing Grace"" and the other of a family of slaves on their journey toward freedom taking the Underground Railroad.  The spiritual symbolism woven throughout is evident, and this movie tugs at the heartstrings and consciences of everyone who watches it.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. does a fantastic portrayal of the father in the slave family who is desperately wrestling with his faith.  His mother, whose faith is constant, recounts the tale of how his grandfather received a beloved family treasure: a Bible.  It was the Bible given by John Newton, who lived agnostically and eventually converted to Christianity after running a slave ship that came to the Americas.

I would recommend this movie for families, except it is not advisable for young children.  There are some scenes of violence, insinuation of rape, and the ""n"" word is used once.  For older children (age 12+), this movie would be a great conversation starter about justice and equality, as well as the importance of faith in difficult or impossible circumstances.  It also serves as a supplement for historical education about slavery and its abolishment in the USA.",1436745600,9,1306,5.2105263157894735

I found this movie to be a sobering reminder of America's past and a reminder of what true courage looks like. I recognize the dialog could have been much more vulgar but that would not have added to the story for me. If a picture is worth a thousand words, certain images spoke more than a thousand words to me.  If you are looking for mere entertainment, look for movies with a shallow story line.
