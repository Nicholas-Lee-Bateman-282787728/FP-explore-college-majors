8199432,2,B000R8PWMQ,"I have a bootleg videocassette of this movie from a Portuguese telecast, which has two or three scenes that were cut from this official Italian release. Normally, I would be against bootlegged videos, but in this instance it's the only way to get the full movie uncut. The edits were not even smooth, especially one of the last scenes; it looks like a weird, unexplained cut. The movie itself is a precursor to Malizia (another Salvatore Samperi film): it has the same director, it uses half of the same cast, it uses the same music composer, it has the same theme, and was made within the same year. Malizia is available uncut either as an old English-dubbed videocassette (""Malicious"") from Paramount or as a Italian-only dvd from General, so I'd recommend buying that movie instead of this one. Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this overpriced dvd (I see some sellers trying to rip unsuspecting buyers by selling them at sticker-shock prices). The Peccato Veniale dvd originally retailed for $23... and even then it was exorbitantly priced (the only good thing about it was its oversized box/cover).",1231632000,9,1109,4.873015873015873
