The characters are so colorful and hilarious that everyone who watches ends up having a different favorite, my personal favorite is Marco - gotta love the underdog!!  This DVD is a must own for anyone who loves to laugh.",990576000,3,313,4.654545454545454
1420066,4,B00005B1WI,"Often when viewing a small budget independent film, you do not know what you are getting in to and it winds up being a pleasant surprise.  This was clearly the case with All Saint's Day which I viewed in advance several months ago.  And, just as I did not know what I was in for by watching this film, the characters did not know what they were getting in to as they hatched a plan for a ""simple"" heist.  The misadventures that the group gets into as they attempt to execute their plan leaves the viewer in stitches and not knowing what lies ahead for them.  There are many comedic overtones, and whether you are a fan of over-the-top slapstick, or refined, subtle humor, you WILL find something to your liking in this movie.  If you have nothing to do, pop in All Saint's Day and you won't be disappointed, if you have something to do, cancel your plans and buy this video now!",985910400,6,878,4.329268292682927

1420085,1,B00005B1WI,"Nauseating nonsense without a single laugh.  Though I did find the opening ""Brooklyn travelogue"" laughable, as it skipped from here, there, and everywhere in the borough without any rhyme or reason.  I can't begrudge the film makers for giving it the ""old community college try"" but why on Earth it ended up as a 4 star choice on this desperate website is beyond my understanding.",1439596800,,380,4.8307692307692305

1420088,1,B00005B1WI,You'd enjoy sticking your hand in the garbage disposal more than watching this piece of crap.,1429660800,,93,4.875
1420089,5,B00005B1WI,"You wouldn't expect me to say anything else, because my son is in the film. I have the film on vhs and most company's wanted $25.00 to transfer it to a cd. This was a better choice it looks good and played without any problems.",1355356800,,227,4.066666666666666
1420090,1,B00005B1WI,"I too thought this was the sequel to Boondock Saints.  I saw that this movie recieved 4.5 stars, from 15 reviewers, and all I can say is that the ratings must have come from the cast, because this movie was absolutely horrible, I am so sorry I can not get my 13.99 + shipping not to mention the 30 minutes I did watch (waiting for it to get better) back.  Out of 400+ Movies in my collection, I would just as soon throw this one in the garbage rather than subject anyone else to wasting their time watching it by trying to re-sell it...I would be surprised if I got 1$.  Please do not buy this film....I wouldn't even watch it boot-leg....
I hope this was helpful....",1247184000,2,667,4.2362204724409445

This dvd is the perfect stocking stuffer ! !",1006646400,,101,5.375
1420093,4,B00005B1WI,"This was a fresh look at young,energetic and wholesome boys trying to find themselves in a stereotypical neighborhood environment. They try to take the easy way out instead of being real men and work hard for a living. It is both delightful and fulfilling. You almost feel kind of sympathetic towards these young wannabes. With a cute cast of main characters and unforgettable extras, this film was truly entertaining. I can't wait to see if there is a sequel.",997401600,,460,4.8354430379746836
1420140,5,B00005B1WI,"This film was a treat to watch.  It made all of us laugh out loud.  It gave me a whole new appreciation for independent cinema.  It's a wacky story about these pathetic yet likely characters who are trying to elevate their social status via an overnight heist on Halloween Night.  Unlike many ""caper gone wrong"" films, ALL SAINTS DAY manages to transcend the cliches and stereotypes that these films tend to possess.  I highly recommned this amusing film!",995587200,,455,4.782051282051282
1420141,5,B00005B1WI,"Tommy LaSorsa is a great director, actor, and writer.  I cannot wait to see what he comes up with next as I enjoyed ""All Saints Day"" so much that I purchased it.  A Clerks-esque dialog coupled with solid acting and direction makes ""All Saints Day"" at the very least a must-rent, and for most of us; a must-buy to have for our personal collections.",994809600,2,347,4.40625
1420142,5,B00005B1WI,"All Saint's Day is an EXCELLENT film, it is very cleverly written with a great setting and cast.  Tommy La Sorsa does an excellent job directing this film and I look foward to seeing more of his work very soon!!!  Since I am from Brooklyn and in the entertainment industry, I can appreciate the dedication and hard work involved in bringing this wonderful film to life, and it is EXCELLENT !!! A must see for everyone",993600000,,417,4.473684210526316
1420143,4,B00005B1WI,"A very amusing tale of a couple of guys from the neighborhood planning & poorly executing a ""heist"".  Darkly humorous, with very likable & well fleshed-out characters.  You really want these guys to get away with it.  Even the DVD interview of LaSorsa is amusing.  Well worth your time, and better than most flicks I've seen lately.  I hope these guys get ""discovered"" soon, I'd love to see what they could do with a real budget.",993427200,,429,4.592105263157895
1420144,5,B00005B1WI,"I'm a big fan of Tommy LaSorsa's work.  This movie is destined to be a classic--perhaps along the lines of Evil Dead II.  This is one you would sit down with a bunch of your friends and just laugh hysterically from beginning to end.  I haven't seen the DVD release as of yet (I'm purchasing it now), but I have seen it in the theater!  The whole place was in a constant state of laughter at the barrage of LaSorsa's native Brooklyn humor and wit!  I would recommend this escapade of five schmucks and the adventure that they go through to teach their evil boss a lesson to anyone!!!!",992822400,,583,4.3119266055045875
1420145,5,B00005B1WI,This is a fantastic movie ! ! ! Tommy La Sorsa has done a masterful job of depicting a local heist gone bad in Brooklyn !! Not since Saturday Night Fever have we been able to relive the true flavor of this urban city!! I loved it in the theaters and even more at home!! I am definitley looking foward to Mr. La Sorsa's next feature.  You have got to see this if you are a fan of movies like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction!!  Truly a work done in the eyes of a young Quetinn Tarantino!!!!,992476800,,487,4.010309278350515

1420148,5,B00005B1WI,"A very funny movie.  A real slice of Brooklyn through the eyes of Tommy J. La Sorsa, a promising new director. A special mention to the cast of local characters in the film, down to the smallest extra - these authentic gems are definetly worth watching. I look forward to more work to come from Mr. La Sorsa.",991785600,,308,4.310344827586207
1420149,5,B00005B1WI,"Funny, and entertaining.  Location (brooklyn) epic, a rare glimpse into a neighborhood saga.  Writing, and direction FIRST CLASS.

C,mon - who wants to watch idiot scumbags acting violent and stupid. IT""S NOT FUNNY - IT""S JUST DEPRESSING TO THINK THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY PEOPLE THIS DYSFUNCTIONAL WHO AREN'T INSTITUTIONALIZED! I don't know what is sadder - that this movie was made or that people watch it and don't think it's the worst piece of garbage ever made.

The very worst part is that there is a small proportion of the population who think this is a reasonable depiction of human behavior - they are or eventually will be diagnosed as psychopaths or schizoid depressants.",1449705600,,705,4.92436974789916
