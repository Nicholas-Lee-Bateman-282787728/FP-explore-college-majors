If you want to enjoy yourself a bit with your baby and you are not fit enough yet, then buy it but if you want to go beyond, to feel and work your body and mind a little bit more, use her usual dvds.
Nevertheless, she is the best!

I literally lost a pound every time I did this video (once a week) - She works on detoxifying as well as strengthening your core muscles.  Though I coudln't do hardly any of the exercises at first, I gained strength and continue to do some of them on my own.
The first 45 minutes or so of the video is exercise for Mom and the last 15 minutes or so if for baby.
Great DVD!",1276732800,6,471,4.153846153846154
