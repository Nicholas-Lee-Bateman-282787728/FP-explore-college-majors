2452382,4,B000C20VK0,"I really like Bob Dylan's albums that he devoted to faith and God. I know many people find this period of his carreer odd or even annoying but I think it was really courageous of him to write and sing what he felt no matter what people thought - he was and still is his own person!

The artists who sing on this film are all terrific musicians. This is one of the best features of this DVD. They also give great commentary on what the songs mean to them which is interesting to hear and gives their renditions of the songs that much more force and intensity.

What is not so interesting are some of the historians and writers who comment on Dylan and this period of his career. They try to explain it or justify it etc. I think that the songs and the artists comments would have been sufficient leaving it up to the viewer to decided his or her own opinion on Dylan and these Gospel songs.

I do recommend this DVD though highly and I think the CD would also be a great purchase!",1189382400,,979,4.169312169312169
2452383,5,B000C20VK0,"In Gotta Serve Somebody, director Michael Borofsky presents us with a documentary about this controversial and enthralling segment of Bob Dylan's storied career. Basically, Serve Somebody documents the making of the 2003 Columbia Records album Gotta Serve Somebody, a record which stitched together some of the greatest Gospel voices of our time (Shirley Caesar; Dottie Peoples; Rance Allen; The Fairfield Four) doing vintage interpretations of Dylan's oft-disregarded Gospel catalog. This is beautiful and timeless music which strikes at the cores of psyche and soul like a triumphant hammer. Simply, this is the music from which legends and poets and seers are brewed. Gotta Serve Somebody swells and bulges with great music. How does one pick centerpieces? No review could ignore Dottie People's riveting version of I Believe In You-- And then there's Rance Allen in the studio doing his version of When He Returns. The Chicago Mass Choir's rendition of Pressing On (led by Dylan's former back-up singer Regina McCrary who stops singing momentarily to candidly speak of how the loss of her child forged a deep undying faith) will make you want to cry: McCrary's vocal teems and soars, her bloody and brazen belief in the aura of the Christ pushing these crystal storms of music to invisible pinnacles -suddenly, it becomes impossible to question a piece of art this multi-dimesional and confessional and pure. Aside from being about great `Gospel' songs, Gotta Serve Somebody comes to collect a sheaf of great poems which speak to a journey isolated in time, speaking to a quest for Christ amid the personal challenges of being a rock-n-roll star. In short, this film serves as a beautiful testament to the growth of a seminal American artist, and it will no doubt be remembered as an important component to Dylan's vast body of work.",1183766400,5,1837,5.106312292358804
2452384,5,B000C20VK0,great! I want to get the cd as well. a great witness to how God can touch someone's heart,1175472000,,89,3.736842105263158
2452385,5,B000C20VK0,He was touched again by the hand that made him.  He quietly holds that hand today.  The music brought tears of joy to my heart.,1175385600,2,127,4.04
2452386,5,B000C20VK0,"As a long-time Dylan fan, I was lucky enough (or should I say blessed), to witness one of the dates on his gospel tour of 1980. I had already read the reviews of the shows, of the near riots over the new material and Dylan's apparent converstion to Christianity. I had also heard his recently released ""Slow Train Coming"" LP. I was taken by the music and the power of Dylan's conviction during the performance. The audience in Birmingham, Alabama seemed much more open to the changes, and lack of Mr. Tambourine Man, and cheered the Dylan Gospel Tour on to great heights. The arrival of a CD and DVD, a quarter of a century later, celebrating the gospel period with some of today's greatest gospel singers and musicians gives justification, once again, to Mr. Dylan's forsight and artistry. The songs and performances, especially Helen Baylor, make this an appealing collection for any fan of Dylan or a music historian. The backstory tales from the musicians performing on the original tracks and tour, and on the current production, add to the enjoyment of hearing the songs done in this fashion. While the originals appeared to be a stumbling block in Dylan's career, they turned out to be a stepping stone in a lifetime of great music.",1164844800,8,1239,4.7407407407407405
2452387,5,B000C20VK0,"A crowd making their way to their destinations in a New York City subway: a blind man with his walking cane; another man doing a soft shoe dance; a woman putting some spare money in a hat; people spilling out of escalators, the humdrum of daily city life...Yet amid this concrete world of souls we see and hear Arlethia Lindsey singing a beautiful version of Bob Dylan's ""Every Grain of Sand.""  Fittingly, this is how the DVD ""Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan"" begins and ends--along with official footage of Dylan himself at the piano in 1980, belting out a heartfelt ""When He Returns.""  And the 80 minutes wedged in between these opening and closing scenes is well worth the $17.99.  Jeff Gaskill, its executive producer, who, as a 17-year-old in May 1980, watched in stunned wonderment as Dylan delivered up his all-gospel show in Worcester, Massachusetts, should be saluted in a big way for creating and bringing forth this project.

I recently discovered that this DVD was featured at the 2006 Park City (Utah) Film & Music Festival--and won the Gold Medal for Excellence for Best Music Documentary.  When it comes to Dylan's so-called gospel years, this is the ultimate DVD to watch and own.  It is a stunning combination of musical performances in the studio by traditional and contemporary gospel artists who are covering Dylan's songs from ""Slow Train Coming"" (1979) and ""Saved"" (1980); this project is the companion piece to the Grammy-nominated CD, ""Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan"" (2003).  Contrary to what one reviewer has suggested, this IS a documentary and brings with it professional graphics, directing, and editing--not to mention a powerful narrative.

In addition to the inspiring performances in the studio (I don't say this lightly), there are a number of interviews with the performers, as well as interviews with those who recorded and/or performed with Dylan back in 1979-1980: drummer Jim Keltner, guitarist Fred Tackett, keyboardist Spooner Oldham, producer Jerry Wexler, and singers Regina McCrary, Terry and Mona Lisa Young.  Also featured are previously unpublished photographs of Dylan recording in Muscle Shoals Sound Studio during the sessions for ""Slow Train Coming"" and ""Saved.""

Oftentimes, when critics are interviewed, it can make for paralyzing analysis; however, in this DVD we hear from Alan Light, a longtime journalist who has obviously thought about this period of Dylan's career, and consequently issues some fresh insight.  And for those who have never seen Paul Williams, author of ""Dylan--What Happened?""--the groundbreaking book written right after Williams absorbed seven of Dylan's concerts in November 1979 (Dylan actually purchased copies for his friends)--we see and hear his unique take on this historical period of Dylan's life and career.

It's worth mentioning that this project is the only outside Dylan tribute project that Dylan himself became involved in.  After becoming aware of the project and reportedly being honored by the artists who were choosing to cover these songs, he chipped in by rewriting his 1979 composition ""Gonna Change My Way of Thinking"" (featured as the closing song on the CD, a duet with Mavis Staples).  This DVD is a wonderful extension of the CD and is something every Dylan fan and appreciator should have.

Just over 20 years ago, in 1985, Dylan said this: ""Regina McCrary played with me for a while.  She's the daughter of Preacher Sam McCrary from Nashville who used to have the old gospel group the Fairfield Four.  Anyway, she would open these shows [Dylan's all-gospel gigs of 1979-1980] with a monologue about a woman on a train; she was so incredibly moving.  I wanted to expose people to that sort of thing because I loved it and it's the real roots of all modern music, but nobody cared.""

Well, now somebody cares: via this DVD, you can catch Regina McCrary leading the Chicago Mass Choir in a spiritually uplifting version of Dylan's ""Pressing On""--as well as the Fairfield Four covering ""Are You Ready?""  Shirley Caesar's ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" will make most anybody care and Dottie Peoples, Helen Baylor and Rance Allen, doing ""I Believe in You,"" ""What Can I Do For You?"" and ""When He Returns,"" respectively, will likely open up your tear ducts.

If the real root of all modern music is gospel music, as Dylan has asserted, then this DVD will provide spiritual nourishment for anyone in these modern times--whether they find themselves in a subway or in their own living room.

2452388,5,B000C20VK0,"Wow, I had the opportunity to see the DVD ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" at a program at my college and I was absolutely amazed at the documentary. I was only able to see about 45 minutes of it and I enjoyed every minute of it. I was actually upset that I didn't get to finish the entire DVD. I wasn't familiar with Bob Dylan until my sophomore year of college. My professor was a huge fan of Mr. Dylan and he introduced us to his music and other aspects of his life. The song that I remember hearing from that year was ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" I immediately fell in love with the song. I was very excited to hear Shirley Caesar sing the song and add her personal touch to the dynamic song. One of the best songs on the DVD was ""Pressing On"" which was preformed by the Chicago Mass Choir. When I heard this song, it literally made me want to jump out my seat and run around the auditorium. I never would have known that the song was by Bob Dylan. The DVD also featured the great Helen Baylor and the song ""What Can I Do For You."" It had been a long time since I had heard her voice (and her testimony) so both of those were a blessing. The DVD is awesome and it is a must have for Bob Dylan fans and Gospel music lovers. Every song and story behind has the potential to impact your life. My only regret with this DVD is that I didn't get to see all of it the night I viewed it, but trust me, I will be watching it in its entirety.",1144195200,7,1420,4.003521126760563
2452389,5,B000C20VK0,"For the Dylan faithful who never overcame their dismay of the gospel years, this DVD brings it all back home and puts that contentious time into perspective. The film adds solid context to the acclaimed CD by interviewing participants and, more importantly, those who lived through that time with Dylan. If you want to know what happened and how, this is the real deal. For the fan, this DVD features footage of Dylan performing ""When He Returns"" in 1980; that's the value of such an authorized project. Plus, if you appreciate the power of good music, you MUST see Rance Allen's performance. Love that period or not, this package tells the powerful story of Dylan at his iconoclastic best.",1144108800,9,690,4.80672268907563
2452390,1,B000C20VK0,"I'm a fan of Dylan's gospel music; but this dvd was nothing but boring.  If you have the cd; there is no point in buying the dvd.  It doesn't make it a documentary simply because you film people recording a cd!  For anyone interested in Dylan's gospel period; i would recommend instead; Bob Dylan 1975-1981 Rolling Thunder and The Gospel Years.  This dvd has about fifteen very revelatory interviews on this entire period of time. This would include Dylan's Bible Class teacher, producer, and background singer.  Along with a lot of great music.",1140393600,14,545,4.817204301075269
2452391,4,B000C20VK0,"If you didn't like Bob Dylan's ""gospel era"" songs, you probably will not appreciate this DVD, but for those of us who do this video is a worthwhile purchase.  Most of the songs from the 2003 ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" album are featured, with commentary by the artists and film of the recording sessions.  Also commentary by Jerry Wexler, Dylan biographer Paul Williams, and other musicians & writers.  It's amazing to see the emotion the performers invested in their recordings.
Not included from the CD are When You Gonna Wake Up by Lee Williams & Spiritual QCs and the Bob Dylan/Mavis Staples duet of Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking.
Solid Rock by Sounds of Blackness is featured but not presented as a complete track.
The other tracks from the CD are featured in the documentary, with the full uninterupted tracks available as bonus tracks.
Two songs not on the CD are included, possibly due to lesser audio quality.  Every Grain Of Sand by Arlethia Lindsay was recorded while busking in a NY subway station,  and In the Garden by the Great Day Chorale was recorded in a church, not a studio.
For Dylan fans, the DVD contains footage of Bob performing When He Returns from Toronto 1980, the first official release of any gospel era video.  Unfortunately, it is not presented continuously, most of it is there but's it's intercut with commentary and not available as an uninterupted bonus track.  Still nice to see though.  The other Bob content is a 1983 animated film set to his original version of Gotta Serve Somebody.
A good DVD for what is included. Only 4 stars due to the missing Bob & Mavis duet and non-continuous Dylan video.",1140048000,18,1635,4.712280701754386
2452418,5,B000C20VK0,"What a pleasant surprise!  I did not know it existed, but ran across it by accident.  Ordered my own personal copy immediately.  I do not love all of the songs nor all of these renditions, but several of them are my new favorites.  Great DVD.",1384992000,,242,4.311111111111111
2452419,3,B000C20VK0,"Why are Bob Dylan covers often so oversung, overplayed, and overpolished?  The one exception is original backup singer Regina McCrary.  3 stars only because these songs deserved acknowledgement and the commentary was basically ok.",1339718400,,230,5.735294117647059
2452420,4,B000C20VK0,"Going by the title, I honestly watched the video expecting to hear a story about Bob Dylan's gospel days/conversion and to see him perform those songs.  Much to my surprise, and pleasure it turned out to be more about later recordings and adaptations of Dylan's gospel songs- most of which were by gospel singers.  First, let me say, I have been a musician and interested in music all of my life, and enjoy any and all types of music.  I am also a Christian, white male, and the gospel version of Pressing on, featuring Regina McCrary along with the Chicago Mass Choir (starts around 1:05 into the video) was so powerful and captivating that it brought me to tears of spiritual joy- I kid you not.  Much of the footage, was either shot in recording studios, churches, along with a bit of commentary from musicians and others others who worked with Dylan over the years.  Don't expect a lot of Dylan concert footage, because there is only a bit of scratchy late 70's film footage in the beginning of the video.  However, the real and absoulte beauty of this video is in the gospel versions of Dylan's songs that you see performed and being recorded by some amazing gospel artists whose passion for their faith and musical talent really reaches out and grabs you.  Watch it, take in some beautiful gospel music performed by tremendously talented people of faith, and hopefully you'll similar experience spirit-filled moments joy that I did while watching. As I started, I'll finish htis review...This video wasn't what I expected from the title, but turned out to be a pleasant surprise.",1325894400,,1585,4.741818181818182
2452421,4,B000C20VK0,"The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan (DVD): There are only a few snippets of Bob himself on this DVD and that is fine because this DVD is not about Bob's performances but about how the Black Gospel Groups embraced Bob's great Gospel songs.  This DVD has some Amazing performances from those Gospel Groups.  Shirley Caesars version of ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" is not to be missed.  This DVD also includes the original animated version of ""Gotta Serve somebody"" (which is sung by Bob but he does not appear in the animated film) and to say that this cartoon is ODD, is to understate how strange it really is.  This film is far from perfect, but it is worth watching and owning.  Four Stars",1325721600,,678,4.524590163934426
2452422,5,B000C20VK0,"Good film! Interesting to see how the die hard liberals came to his concerts only to diss him for playing gospel; holding up ""protest"" signs while booing him, and demanding he play his old songs as if they owned him. As is stated in the film they ""loved him for saying,`I aint gonna work on maggie's farm no more"" but the public ""screamed outrage"" when they felt that Dylan had left ""their farm."" One has to ask why they came anyway? Evidently they came to disrupt what they did not understand, and what they hated; the whole time thinking they could control Dylan and force him into their manageable little box so they could hold him up as if too say, ""look at what we have created, he belongs to us, he is our slave."" Dylan ""presses on to the higher callin of the Lord"" never giving in to their demands and instead embraces the Holy.

People who think they own Dylan, or his music are delusional. The same applies to any other artist or person, no one owns anybody. The slave drivers who have never given up their dream of the Southern slave state continue to find ways of expressing their desire to hold slaves in any format they can conjure, and the demands of conformity to their paradigm are just another expression of that perverse ideology. The music in this film, Dylan's gospel music, is some of the most poignant gospel music ever written. You will not find any fluff here, just straight up music written and performed by a broken human being, who just like most of the rest of us realizes there is something more, something greater than ourselves and who he identifies as ""the mighty God"" (when he returns). Dylan shows his connection to that God when he speaks of himself as ""the property of Jesus,"" and ""I've been saved by the blood of the lamb."" But, as Dylan wrote; and it seems to apply to those who sought to control him, ""you've got something better, you've got a heart of stone.""",1308787200,,1899,4.472622478386167
2452423,1,B000C20VK0,"I urge shoppers to buy the CD rather than the DVD, because the editing of the DVD is astoundingly atrocious.  Most of the shots less less than one second, so that very often each second features several jump cuts, literally more frequent than every half second!  Actually this DVD (or at least, the copy I rented from Netflix) offers the viewer two options, and this review refers only to the option of viewing the ""interrupted"" version of each performance.  The default option, I think, interrupts each song to intersperse interviews.  I presume the default version is edited like a standard documentary, not so much of interest to someone who'd like to see how each performance works as a whole song.  There was no option to watch the interrupted performances and then interviews (unless one cares to watch the songs a second time to catch the interspersed interviews).  (In order to cut to each song's ""uninterrupted"" version, the viewer must press ""enter"" on the remote when a treble clef appears onscreen near the start of each song-segment.  One annoying problem is that the DVD tends to revert to the start of the *previous* segment you just watched, rather than to the start of the onscreen one you're trying to watch.  Not only is this very inconvenient, moreover it means that you can't just let it play the interrupted songs the way you would a CD.)

A few of the performances on the CD are great, and well worth hearing, but I found them all unwatchable because all the jump cuts, several per second, made me queasy.  One of the great performances is simply one singer and one pianist, yet there were two cameras on the singer:  even when the editor chose to show the singer singing more than one consecutive phrase, the edit jumps back and forth between the two camera angles.  It's sickening, and utterly out of keeping with the songs.

Worse still, this DVD has value as documentation of interracial crossover, but the editing struck me as racist because it features the White studio musicians noticeably more than the Black performers. It's a terrible irony.  How wonderful that Dylan used Black Gospel music to great effect in his compositions, and that these world-beating Black performers honored these compositions by giving their all to perform them as Black Gospel songs.  How atrocious that some editor not only made a stroboscopic edit of every single song, but also focused the video way inordinately on the White studio musicians.",1308614400,2,2456,4.856115107913669

2452427,5,B000C20VK0,"Gotta Serve Somebody is a well-produced music documentary that showcases highly-skilled and creative artists in studio recording sessions. Individually, and inter-dependently, they attempt to reach personal pinnacles of expression in their interpretations of some well-chosen Dylan `gospel' songs. Opportunities to view musicians recording in a studio are rare; recording sessions produced with such attention to technical details of filming are even rarer and Gotta Serve Somebody may be in a class all its own. Some of the vocalists are well-known; others are probably known to followers of gospel music; their performances are strong and triumphant - even delicate and powerful, at the same time - as they react to the lyrics and the other musicians. Each and every musician, not only the vocalists, is emotionally invested in this music; their collaboration during recordings is a focus, in itself. The interviews with musicians are enlightening but the film is mostly about Bob Dylan's music. Dylan obviously chose gospel as the most easily identifiable and naturally adaptive style to express his words and sentiments in these songs. The music, lyrics excluded, is worthy of reflection to anyone who is interested in what constitutes `great artists' - their development through time and their exploration of nearly every possible genre as a means of personal expression. The lyrics reflect Dylan's personal longing for salvation and joy in the mystery of his own transformation, in contemporary Christian religious vernacular. For those who think that his gospel songs are best left to people with similar religious beliefs, adjust your attitudes. These songs represent each and every descendant of humanity who thinks, wonders, stumbles and falls, and seeks direction outside of what is only obvious and potentially disappointing. It isn't the target of salvation, but the act of seeking it that is, in itself, redemptive.",1189814400,2,1929,5.476510067114094
