5086948,5,B007HMCQBA,"To understand the Lupin megafranchise one must understand the first TV series. This series is not only historically significant but an interesting lesson on what happens when the directors get shifted in a TV series. This can be seen as representative of the entire Lupin franchise--It starts out harder-edged and violent but goes into a transition period where it gradually becomes more family-friendly and marketable. In a sense it has every interpretation of Lupin--the hard edge of the manga, the light-hearted but still violent Red Jacket series, and the wacky capers of the Pink Jacket series (by the way, Discotek--I would love you forever if you brought this over)and Discotek Media's wonderful set brings the original TV series over on DVD remastered and subtitled only.
The extras are great, more than anime fans are used to but no doubt less than a fan of bigger blockbusters would expect.
The series is a delight, the disc is a delight--everything's great! Buy this disc if you're a Lupin fan--and despite the dated animation, it's a great place to start if you're new to Lupin.
Definitely one of the better sets in my collection!",1350950400,8,1142,4.984293193717278
5086949,5,B007HMCQBA,"I haven't seen these episodes of Lupin since my college days back during the early '80s when I would watch multi-generational VHS copies of Lupin and other anime with my friends at a local anime club.  This box set certainly brings back some wonderful memories. I especially enjoyed watching the episodes directed by Miyazaki.  I'll admit that the opening theme song is a bit annoying.  The various opening theme songs from the second Lupin TV series was much better.  Those songs had more of a Jazz flavor.  The antics of Lupin and company are a treat.  This crew doesn't always get to keep the loot nor does Lupin always get the girl, especially, if her name happens to be Fujiko!  Come to think of it she often stiffs Lupin and makes off with the loot.  Watch Lupin's first TV show and see how it all began.  You'll be in for a hilarious and wild ride.  Enjoy!",1348272000,5,863,4.4743589743589745
5086950,5,B007HMCQBA,"This set contains the first series of Lupin the 3rd which is a very good series for the most part. The show is older which would be a turn off to some people but it is to good to just let it pass. Anyone who is a fan of Lupin will enjoy this set.

While the show alone would make me give this set a five star rating Discotek impresses me with their special features. Included both versions of the pilot Lupin films and notes on every episode. Even after that the set has essays and commentaries from Lupin fans and are really worth listening to.

All in all for those who have seen something Lupin the 3rd in the past and enjoy the adventures of the master thief, this set should be considered for a purchase to go into your collection.",1344643200,4,736,4.176056338028169
5086951,5,B007HMCQBA,"When we think of Lupin today, we think of a funny, amicable thief who has a heart of gold. That's why some fans were a little put off by the fact that the newest Lupin TV series, ""The Woman Named Fujiko Mine"", was incredibly dark and disparate in its approach to the franchise. What those fans may not remember, however, is that the latest series is actually closer to the master thief's beginnings than any of the entries released in the last 20 years or so. ""Lupin the 3rd: Series One"" is sinister and mysterious, and much of its humor is perverted or black. However, this is not a knock on the show. In fact, it is a complement, for it is undoubtedly a classic that anybody, anime fan or no, will enjoy.

The shtick is pretty familiar at this point, so I'll keep it brief. Titular protagonist Arsene Lupin III is a master thief, known for his vivacious personality, ability to defy common logic, and weakness for women. His partner is Daisuke Jigen, a sharpshooter with a sharp wit to match; later, stoic master samurai Goemon Ishikawa XIII joins his team. Throughout it all, femme fatale Fujiko Mine constantly seduces and subsequently undermines the main trio's heists. Unlike her appearances in later entries, this Fujiko is coldhearted, and is more of a villain than fans of the second series would be led to believe. Underscoring this groups exploits is the brave, bumbling Inspector Zenigata, who is always just ONE STEP AWAY from catching Lupin. Together, this motley crew of characters get into various tight spots, helping and hindering each other in varying amounts.

While the routine is similar to contemporary entries, the direction is anything but. The first nine episodes helm closer to Monkey Punch's original manga than any series up until ""The Woman Named Fujiko Mine"", nailing effortless coolness and seedy undertones with the minimalist stylings of director Masaaki Osumi. Fan service and sex jokes, though tame by today's standards, abound in these episodes. Lupin is more carnal, and the plots are more intricate. In my opinion, the best of these episodes is the fourth, ""One Chance To Break Out"", in which Lupin makes one of his most daring and intelligent escapes in the history of the series for the sole purpose of humiliating Zenigata. It's a joy to watch, and strikes the perfect balance of grime and whimsy.

The latter of those two traits takes over after episode nine, however, when Osumi was kicked off the show for refusing to make it more family-friendly. That's when little-known talents Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata (yes, THOSE guys) were brought in and given a chance to shine. The sensibilities and sense of wonder that would later define their Studio Ghibli films are all here; their episodes wash off excess grime and focus on crazy capers, turning Lupin into more of the lovable knucklehead we know him as today. While the early episodes are amazing in their own right, the series would have arguably not had its perpetual popularity without Miyazaki and Takahata's magic touch. It could be said that these two men defined the Lupin character as we know him today. Given that he is one of anime's definitive characters, this is no small accomplishment.

What remains consistent are both the excellent voicework and jazzy soundtrack. Yasuo Yamada, who retained the role of Lupin (with one exception in ""The Fuma Conspiracy"") until his 1995 death, is wonderful here. Seeing him slowly get the feel for a character that would define his career is a joy to watch. The same goes for the other actors, who stayed on board until the latest film, ""Blood Seal - Eternal Mermaid."" The soundtrack is a prime slice of old school jazz by Takeo Yamashita and Charlie Kosei, made before composer Yuji Ohno came in and decided he wanted to stay on board for every single piece of Lupin animation from the second series onward. Music here is a clear inspiration for Yoko Kanno's soundtrack in the 1998 masterpiece, ""Cowboy Bebop.""

The same goes for this whole series, as Shinichiro Watanabe has admitted in interviews before. Needless to say, a direct inspiration for such a stroke of brilliance can't be that bad. While some of the more hardcore Lupin fans (although I find it hard to imagine there are those more obsessed with the franchise than me) will argue which half of the show is better, I choose to sit back and take in the whole experience. This show is a true classic, and one of the first examples of true maturity and sophistication in Japanese animation. Lupin has stolen countless treasures in his forty-plus year run, but with this series, he manages to capture the hearts and minds of viewers. And that, as Zenigata puts it in the timeless ""The Castle of Cagliostro"", is the most precious treasure of all.

5086952,5,B007HMCQBA,"Lupin the Third series is one of the long running TV animation series in Japan. Its TV-special programs are also an annual fixture in Japan and its film releases have been countering well even with Ghibli and Doraemon ones. The first season aired in 1971 is also known as Miyazaki-Takabata team's early works before they formed Ghibli. To be more exact both Miyazaki and Takabata worked as A-production partly from early episodes and their names are not credited in either Opening or Ending theme endrolls. They got involved with this TV animation on condition that their names are not credited. While its early episodes are faithful to Monkey Punch's original comic book stories which are rather tailored to adult audience, the latter episodes directed by A-production led by Takabata-Miyazaki team made it comprehensible even understandable to children.

Three different openings are used and the latter two of them are no doubt by A-production which are really comprehensive. The first four episodes are raw in animation sequence but the story line is well-structured and impressive. The protagonist Lupin the third is the grandson of Arsene Lupin the popular French hero and a great thief created by Maurice Leblanc. Daisuke Jigen is the A-1 gunman who always assists Lupin's work. Goemon Ishikawa XIII is the swordsman who uses iron-cutting sword. Goemon first appears in this series on episode #5 as Lupin's adversary. But he eventually joins Lupin team in episode #7. Inspector Zenigata is the archrival of Lupin who devotes his life to capture Lupin. As episode #4 shows he actually likes Lupin and does not want Lupin to get executed. Fujiko Mine is Lupin's current girlfriend but she often moves in her own accord and often uses Lupin team for her own plan. Fujiko first appears as long-haired sexy girl typical heroine Yasuo Otsuka the director of the animation series love. But when drawn by Miyazaki Fujiko has red short hair and intelligent look and often operates kyte-plane. When Miyazaki-style Fujiko appeared for the first time in episode 14 most of the viewers might have wondered ""who is that girl?"". So latter episodes sometimes miss Fujiko partly because Miyazaki was not satisfied with his version of Fujiko. A-production led latter half is filled with action after another.

Verdict: Lupin series with two different styles but both are nice in its own right.
Rating: 90 out of 100
Recommended for: The fans of James Bond styled action dramas, fans of Japanese animation.",1342742400,5,2494,5.080487804878048
5086953,5,B007HMCQBA,"Since its creation in the late 60's, Lupin the 3rd has had several television series and feature-length adaptations of the original manga created by Monkey Punch.  This DVD collects the first-and arguably, the best-series, with many episodes directed by legendary anime filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki.  This is the first time that this series has been brought over for an official release here in the States, and as such, these episodes have never been dubbed.  The language options are Japanese in 2.0, and Japanese in 5.1, with English subtitles, which is how the majority of Lupin fans would argue the series was meant to be seen anyway.

The package itself doesn't contain too many frills--liner notes for each episode and a couple episode commentary tracks by American ""Lupin experts"" are the two main bonus features, but it does contain both versions (theatrical and TV edit) of the Lupin feature-length pilot.  It's not quite barebones, but it isn't ""deluxe"" either, and for the $50 pricetag, that could be a dealbreaker for some.  Personally, for a collection of what might be the best 23 episodes of one of my favorite animated franchises, it was absolutely worth it.",1340668800,30,1170,5.036269430051814
5086954,4,B007HMCQBA,"This Anime is truly a really old one. The character hardly move at all (There is tons of standing still, only mouth moving scenes), each episodes story is predictable and the series isn't as perverted as the new Lupin. But is it entertaining? Hell yeah!

The music is one of the highlights here. The theme song consists entirely of a man reapeating ""Lupin the 3rd"" in different tones. The BGM is really awesome too. One infamous track is ""Lupin - Nice Guy"", a song where a man brags about Lupin in weird ways. The intro uses scenes from the episodes, but in a really amusing, 70's kind of way. It's like the cartoons you used to watch when you were a kid. Most of the episodes isn't continuous, so you can basicly watch any episode you watch. The only episode that proves different, is when Goemon arrives.

Since Hayao Miyazaki took over the show after episode 8, there is almost none nudity after this. The first 8 episodes have fanservice, but much milder than today. The story telling is also really good and keeps you glued to the screen for at least 4 episodes! And the detailed characters, it's freaking epic! When was the last time you say an young Anime character with hairy legs and even hands?

This may serve great for people who have never watched Lupin before. Or just Lupin fans who love this guy. This is, by my opinion, the best Lupin series ever. Miyazaki proves to us that Lupin really is a nice guy, even though he is a thief. He is kindhearted, always there for his friends and doesn't shoot people just for fun. The voices fits the characters perfectly, and even though the audio is only available in mono sound (The JP track) the series doesn't get bad because of that.",1335398400,23,1692,4.487012987012987

5086970,5,B007HMCQBA,"As a serious Lupin III fan since the 80's, I am thrilled to have this set (my old, used, and abused VHS tapes are long gone).  The transfer is excellent, the sound is as good as it can reasonably get, given the limitations of the period in which it was originally recorded, and the sub-titling is quality.  Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that newer anime fans (and I mean the ones that turn their noses up at anything more than ten years old and whine about the quality of the animation) will suddenly love decades-old anime.  They will probably be particularly stunned by the soundtrack, which was groundbreaking at the time.

To kill the suspense, the episodes that Miyazaki was involved in were #'s 8, 10, 11, and 13 ~ 23.  His influence is obvious.  Bits of anime that he re-purposed for later productions are everywhere, and his downplay of the hard-edged violence that marked the earlier episodes changed the course of anime-Lupin, making it a distinctly different series from Monkey Punch's original manga-Lupin.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing - I love both versions of Lupin III - just that this series is where that happened, and anyone interested to see how such a transition takes place would do well to watch this.",1402790400,2,1233,4.706976744186046

First half is more hard-boiled and dark while still featuring campy thrills and the lighthearted character interactions and personalities. Second half is less intense in regards to tone but still full of action and intrigue, as well as a bit more of a whimsical adventure side. Both tones are extremely enjoyable to watch because at the end of the day these characters simply never get old and it will always be entertaining to see what shenanigans they get themselves into. The animation and directing holds up relatively well, especially in the Miyazaki and Takahata directed later episodes. Music is also surprisingly enjoyable. Not nearly as iconic as the Yuji Ohno music that was introduced in Part 2 and has become synonymous with almost every entry to this day, but still quite good by its own merits. Certainly deserving of more recognition than it gets in future installments in the franchise (i.e. none). The quality of the actual release is what you'd expect from an early 70's anime on DVD.
