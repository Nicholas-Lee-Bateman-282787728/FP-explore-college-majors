2699509,4,B000L2129U,"This is one of the best detective shows ever.  John Nettles is terrific!  The acting and the writing are outstanding.  Even if you're not usually into mysteries, the regular cast and writing make it worth a try.

I was disappointed that there are only 3 discs, yet the cost is the same as the 4 disc sets have been.  That's a rip, so I only gave 4 stars.  It's also always disappointed me that these are not released in order and not all of the episodes are released.  The Maiden episode is clearly an earlier one when Dan Scott and Barnaby are still trying to get used to each other.  The writers were trying to loosen Dan up and make him a bit more like Troy -- a mistake.  I do miss Troy.  He had much more humor than Scott does and he screwed up now and then, like a young, over-eager detective may do.  Mostly, his driving ""skills"" made for some good laughs.  Scott doesn't provide too many laughs, so the whole series has less right now.

Still, John and the other cast members make the show so good, it's worth buying this set.  Christmas episodes tend to be overly sentimental and sugary sweet, but this one isn't -- Thankfully!  The writers did a great job, as usual.",1175904000,,1176,4.30593607305936
2699510,5,B000L2129U,"For many years now, I've been able to depend on the ""Midsommer Murders"" series bring me good entertainment that always resulted in me having extreme comfort in the knowledge that I would be viewing a series that contained some wonderful acting, great stories with ""jolly good"" mysteries and some very interesting characters. This three disc, three episode (about a 100 minutes each) Season Eight is no exception.  Barnaby played wonderfully by John Nettles is back along with his ""new"" sidekick a kind of cynical Sergeant Dan Scott as played by John Hopkins.  As in season seven, they are still making a ""good team"" solving dastardly murders in supposedly peaceful Midsommer village.  Barnaby on an occasion does wonderfully lose his patience with Sergeant Dan Scott; however, as I've said before, he does it like a ""favorite"" uncle would do it and Sergeant Dan Scott does in this season deserve to be taken down a ""notch or two""---he does seem to think that he has all of the ladies in a swoon including Barnaby's wife and daughter.  Nevertheless, on my part, there were never any longings for homophobic Troy (Barnaby's former partner).  I do still like Scott's demeanor and humor and I do think he and Barnaby make a good team for as long as it may last.

All in all this is a really good season with murder/mysteries that are intriguing and interesting  enough to keep one awake and alert; however, complicated enough to keep one guessing  just who might have done the deed. The ""body count"" is still rather large; however, the length (about 100 minutes)of each episode, allows each case to be solved splendidly with many false leads of ""who done it?""; plus, it allows a fine introduction to some eccentric and fascinating inhabitants of Midsommer--what a great assortment!  It kept me always guessing the outcome--jolly good!

(By the way, the episode called ""The  ghosts of Christmas Past"" is marvelous.  It is filled with villiagers singing Xmas Carols, plum pudding, questionable suicides, magic, murders, spooky houses, a very precocious kid, etc.  After one views that episode ""visions of sugar plums"" WON'T be dancing through one's head.  It's really good and mysterious!)",1175472000,13,2183,4.994475138121547

The  lush meadows, spooky woods, fairy tale cottages and mansions, and characters, so eccentric they could only live in insular English villages, all combine to trap the viewer in a world that probably doesn't exist anymore if it ever really did. I defy anyone to hate being so trapped.

And the murders!

2699536,5,B000L2129U,"This review will have to suffice for all the other ""Midsomer Murders"" DVD's we have purchased and will buy in the future!

These Amazon issued Midsomer Murders are truly magnificent!  Each takes place in a small British village that has been around for centuries.  The people have secrets that have been around nearly as long and festered!  Everyone thinks that they know all there is to know about one another, but they don't.  Something happens to rile someone enough to off his or her neighbor which brings in our familiar, reliable, intelligent Chief Inspector Barnaby and while he and his assistant attempt to find out what has happened yet another person bites the dust!  We get involved in the lives of the police and C.I. Barnaby's family and, of course, the people in the villages.

Each ""Murder"" in each Set lasts nearly 2 hours and there are nearly always 4 units in each Set so one gets nearly 8 wonderful hours of viewing.  We ration ours carefully.  We were delighted to find out that there are far more sets than we had been seeing on our PBS TV station, which seems to have gotten to only Set 8 or 9.  Maybe 10?  Having seen those 2 or 3 times each and now seeing that the sets go up to number 22 via Amazon we are very, very happy.",1378684800,,1248,4.4298245614035086

2699560,5,B000L2129U,"""Midsomer Murders Set Eight"" is a boxed, 3-volume set of three contemporary, stand-alone British mysteries, each approximately 100 minutes long, from the popular British TV hit, which first aired in the United Kingdom in March, 1997.  The series has been seen on ""A & E"" and ""The Biography Channel,"" in the United States. The characters are based on those created by Caroline Graham, a modern mistress of the English village cozy mystery: the series was originally adapted by highly talented and acclaimed scriptwriter Anthony Horowitz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Sets-1-5-Bundle-Amazon-com-Exclusive/dp/B001EWF7VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Sets 1-5 Bundle (Amazon.com Exclusive)</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-of-Sherwood-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00180IPQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin of Sherwood: The Complete Collection</a>).

Special features include a Graham biography, John Nettles interview, Midsomer map, and cast filmographies.  But, unfortunately, no subtitles; as all the characters speak rather softly, and John Nettles, the series' star, tends to swallow his words.  However, you should be able to follow the action well enough without the subtitles.

The series is set in the fictional, lovely, countryside village of Midsomer; and it certainly is green, quaint, and scenic.  It's a classic ""cozy"" setting; lovely village, denizens upset by murder, villain found; everything back to normal again.  It stars John Nettles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BERGERAC-SERIES-1-COMPLETE/dp/B001VWMY9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BERGERAC - SERIES 1 - COMPLETE </a>) as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, hard-working family man and astute detective; and John Hopkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-in-a-Cold-Climate/dp/B000A6T1W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love in a Cold Climate</a>) as his brash young assistant Sergeant Dan Scott.  Jane Wymark and Laura Howard costar as Joyce and Cully Barnaby, the detective's wife and daughter.  The series also features many esteemed guest stars, including John Burgess, William Gaunt, Freddie Jones, Keith Barron, and Margery Mason: the supporting players bring a lot of spice to the screen. Nor have the makers stinted in the making of this series: they've supplied beautiful landscapes, plenty of extras, animal and human, lots of local color.  The mysteries are:
1. The Maid in Splendour.  Midsomer Worthy's favorite pub is suddenly awash in secret business deals, unrequited loves, passionate affairs, and murder.
2. The Straw Woman. In Midsomer Parva, a local schoolteacher tries to revive an ancient local festival, with disastrous results.  A curate dies violently, to be followed by other violent deaths.  The village suspects black magic: the detectives solve a centuries-old mystery.  Viewers may be reminded of some of Stephen King's work; but that's not where the plot is ultimately going.
3. Ghosts of Christmas Past.  The Villiers family gathers to celebrate Christmas exactly nine years after Ferdy Villiers committed suicide, a suicide that was soon followed by that of his attractive assistant/lover.  Another member of the family dies mysteriously; the secrets of the past seem to reach out to the present.

These mysteries are greatly enriched by the fact that they are feature length, allowing screenwriters and cast sufficient time to develop them subtly and with wit and flavor.  They are complex, intelligent and original; perhaps a little unlikely, but involving all the same.",1246579200,6,3660,6.465163934426229

Found Sergeant Scott to be a bit less 'smirky' than in his few earlier episodes - but his night with a suspect/then victim in one episode didn't add much to either his character or plot development.

As usual Midsomer Murders delivers charming bucolic English murder mysteries.  The characters are quirky, John Nettles is wonderful and John Hopkins is starting to come into his own as DS Scott.

However there are a few negative.  First this is actually the second half of the seventh season, which makes numbering the DVD sets annoying for those of us who are anal retentive.  (It still somewhat bothers me that the Travelling Wilburys labelled their two albums, volume I and volume III)

Also this set is shorter than the previous sets having only three episodes.  The series finally gets around to the ""themed"" shows having what can only be lablelled their Halloween and Christmas episodes.  The Halloween episode was more than a bit contrived, but the Christmas episode made up for it.

All in all, this series is a predictable and enjoyable bit of English cosy and I do recommend you watch it with a nice pot of Darjeeling tea and some shortbread.",1182211200,15,1065,4.802197802197802

The mysteries are well written and I really enjoyed the ""Straw Woman"" as it got Sergeant Scott a larger than normal part in a well written and thought provoking case.  I enjoyed all three episodes and look forward to more Midsomer Murders in the future.",1178409600,,552,4.49

tv series, ""Bergerac"". I wasn't sure I would like the new ones with

a new side kick, John Hopkins but as much as I loved the old ones,

I think the new ones are even better. I am looking forward to more in this series.",1176681600,5,286,4.071428571428571

8159831,5,B000L2129U,"Elegant country estates and picturesque cottages hide dastardly activities in Englands Midsomer County, where corpses seem to stack like kindling, murders are often remarkably grotesque, and motives range from bizarre to out-and-out kinky. Based on novels and characters created by Caroline Graham and debuting in 1997, the long-running BBC series MIDSOMER MURDERS features Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles), his slightly daffy wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), and their theatrically ambitious daughter Cully (Laura Howard.) Tom is assisted in his cases by the sleek and cynical D.S. Dan Scott (John Hopkins), ) and a number of medical men, most often the dryly comic Dr. Bullard (Barry Johnson.) The repeating characters are often supported by luminaires from the British stage, screen, and television, and the scripts are memorable for their dark witbut in spite of the humor, episodes often include a strange sense of tragedy. Although the central characters sometimes have overarching storylines, each episode stands alone, a complete story told in about an hour and forty minutes.

Set Eight is confusing, for there are two collections so described.  This version contains only three titles.  The first is The Maid In Splendor, clever story that involves offensive gentrification, battle for ownership of a pub, and old love affairs that spill over into present day.  The Straw Woman is the first title in the series that I saw, and it is a remarkably creepy one.  A young school teacher revives the tradition of the straw woman, in which villagers burn an effigy of a giant womanbut when the effigy burns, a man burns with it.  Add in a fast-living Hugh Heifer-type publisher, a pigs head, and several more burnings, and soon accusations of witchcraft abound.  The third title is Ghosts of Christmas Past, in which Barnaby dodges a visit from his in-laws via a case that seems to be tied to a decade-old suicide.

In addition to memorable performances, great scripts, and first rate production values, MIDSOMER MURDERS also has an intriguing score and makes effective, often paranoia-inducing, use of prowling cameras that sometimes take the killers point of view. And it is the rare episode that stops at one or murders. Three is commonplace, four is not exactly unknow, and fans of the cozy genre may well find the series a bit too disturbing for their tastes. But if you like a good murder mystery, youll find it in this series. Its immediately addictive. Strongly recommended.
