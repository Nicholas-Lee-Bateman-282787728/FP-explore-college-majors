8224562,5,B000WOSB3W,"The Biography Channel biography of Anna Nicole Smith was truly an eye opener--she went thru so much and still came out ahead. Finally when she thought it had all come together, she left way too early.  We got the movie ahead of schedule and in perfect condition--Your Awesome and  above average",1464998400,,294,4.745098039215686
8224563,5,B000WOSB3W,We love Anna Nicole Smith. I had some of her dvd's that I don't have anymore. This is from Biography on A&E and it is informative and gives you insight about her life and its ups and downs. She was beautiful but when she got into drugs her looks changed. She was still beautiful but something was missing. Feb. 8 is the anniversary of her tragic death.,1457136000,,352,4.268656716417911
8224564,2,B000WOSB3W,if you love anna its good to have but as many of the documentaries made about her its a kind of negative view especially because they have that douche bag (the author of big beautiful doll) speaking through most of it.,1421798400,,218,4.341463414634147
8224565,5,B000WOSB3W,"I ordered this DVD. It Came on Time. I like the Story of Anna Nicole Smith, I would Order this DVD again for my Family to Watch it.
The Picture and Sound Quality is Great, I would Recommend it.",1395100800,2,193,3.9743589743589745
8224566,3,B000WOSB3W,it wasn't what I completely expected but I was still okay and I got it fast. I thought that it would be longer and contain more footage of her. it was okay though.,1372723200,2,163,3.9696969696969697
8224567,3,B000WOSB3W,"I would say that this is a must-have for any die-hard Anna Nicole Smith fan. Just because if you are a die-hard, this will have information that you probably already know, but footage that has probably long since seen the light of day. The problem with this biography is that it rushes through Anna's life at lightening speed. If you're looking for something that goes more in depth, this is not something you will want to buy. If you are someone who wants everything Anna Nicole, and want to have something just to have some different interviews, pictures, shots, etc, then you will enjoy this. Again, the problem is the speed at which this program goes. Anyone who knows anything about Anna Nicole knows her life was one rollercoaster full of ups and downs, and things that soap opearas are made of. It somehow manages to stuff Anna's entire life into 50 minutes. So, it is pretty surfacey stuff. Also, the people they chose to talk to, or were able to get to talk to them, are probably people who didn't really know that much about her. They talked to people who knew the old Vickie Lynn Hogan, which I'm sure everyone who is a fan of Anna's saw on the E! True Hollywood Story. They also talk with Eric Redding, author of the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Big-Beautiful-Doll-The-Anna-Nicole-Smith-Story/dp/1569803285/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Big Beautiful Doll: The Anna Nicole Smith Story</a>&nbsp;and also appeared on the E! THS special. He doesn't seem to speak to highly of her, in his book, or on the THS. Although on this program, I don't remember him seeming specifically negative. I just got the impression from the ETHS that he has a stick up his @%% about her. I have not finished reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Big-Beautiful-Doll-The-Anna-Nicole-Smith-Story/dp/1569803285/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Big Beautiful Doll: The Anna Nicole Smith Story</a>, so I can't say entirely what I think of him or it. Thusfar, it seems like he takes a lot of credit for her fame. And yes, he did ""discover"" her in the sense that he shot the pictures to be sent to Playboy, but I find that he has a biased opinion of her. Maybe even some bitterness towards her. They also speak with the same relatives as on that program, and most of it is the same stories, maybe repeated in different words. They don't talk to anyone who was close to Anna near the end of her life. There was a program on E! that aired shortly after the two year anniversary of her death, which I found to be much better. This is all sort of regurgitated information. Also, as I stated, because of speed, they did not go really in depth on anything. If you want to know the story of Anna Nicole Smith, yes, you will enjoy this and get something out of it. If you are die-hard and like to see every snippet possible, then you will enjoy it as well, because there are shots of Anna and interviews with her interpserced troughout. But if you are looking for something that goes into the depths of the life, more behind the scenes, this is not something for you. I would recommend trying to find the E! special if it ever goes to DVD. It is two or three hours. They definitely should have made this biography longer in order for it to be anything great. But, if you need everything Anna, then this is something you would want to by. They just crunch a lot of her life into a 50 minute time span, which I'm sure was difficult. Oh yes, they also have Perez Hilton on, as I suppose, a sort of objective on-loooker? Although I am not really sure why he was chosen specifically for the show. I would recommend this for people who want to know the surface story of Anna Nicole Smith, or die-hards who just can't get enough even if it's information they already know.",1237766400,4,3851,4.827534039334342
8224568,4,B000WOSB3W,"I have almost no idea why Lindsay Lohan, Katie Holmes, and Paris Hilton are famous and always in front of the cameras.  I know much more about Anna Nicole Smith, but for people who haven't this will be quite informative.

This work uses her marriage to an 80 year-old as its focal point.  In fact, it doesn't speak about her childhood until 10 minutes in.  In all these facts about her topsy-turvy life, I kept thinking, ""Now who's caring for her son during all this!""  However, he was often in photos, so maybe he saw firsthand all the drama.  I learned stuff.  I knew Anna Nicole worshipped Marilyn Monroe, but I never knew her name too was different on her birth certificate.  I'm not surprised, but this confirmed that her upstairs was surgeon-created.  I think the work only hinted at her same-sex attractions and other sources say more fervently that she was bisexual.

Like many a documentary, this interviewed both everyday acquaintances and media experts.  Still, I felt like the media experts were just people who are up on the tabloids too.  I think many of them could yak about Ms. Smith like they could about any celebrity.  I know a lot of folk can't stand Perez Hilton, but I think he's a hot oso cubano.  Here, his hair is a natural color, rather than blue or purple.  Still, he has this nasty shave marks in his eyebrow like Vanilla Ice.  I don't know why he went there.  Of course, his comments were the liveliest and most memorable in the documentary, but again, I hardly doubt he's an Anna expert.

The narrator who speaks about Anna's last child is different from the one who speaks about her death.  Like the documentary on Strom Thurmond, I think A&E tacked on an epilogue after Ms. Smith passed away.  I don't even recall them saying Larry Birkhead was proved to be the child's father.",1201564800,8,1809,4.576323987538941
