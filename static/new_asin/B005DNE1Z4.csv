8467223,1,B005DNE1Z4,"This film is not a serious educational film but is a Hollywood entertainment movie. If I can, I would rate this entertainment film a 0 star for entertainment (boring Hollywood movie) and a 0 star for its attempt to be a serious educational or informative film. The movie was made by a magician. A magician succeeds when he fools the eye and mind. Magicians serve to entertain us, like this film. That is what this entertainment movie is, just a magic trick, not a serious educational documentary. The creator of this DVD can't compare with greats of the art world like Penn Jillette, Raymond Joseph Teller and Tim Jenison.",1410912000,,622,4.715596330275229
