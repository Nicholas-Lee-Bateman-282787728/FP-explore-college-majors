7731705,4,B01E6E50HI,I was a little disappointed by the use of English-speaking actors and actresses rather than Japanese-speaking with subtitles. It would have been more authentic. Movie just didn't have the right effect.,1470873600,,201,5.516129032258065
7731706,5,B01E6E50HI,"I too received a copy of this movie through digital download. First off, the visual style of this film is quite unlike anything out there.  As the last reviewer mentioned, this is clearly not a big studio movie.  But the filmmakers did not intend this to look like a generic Hollywood studio pic. In fact this film benefits tremendously for having a smaller budget. What the filmmakers have done is create a work of much higher artistic merit and integrity than most big studio type of films. Visually stunning and poetic. The bombing sequence is particularly powerful, conveying the horror without making it unwatchable. The performances of the lead actors are all top notch, with Leo Ashizawa embodying the role of Takashi Nagai. This is a film to watch again and again.",1464480000,6,772,4.840909090909091
7731707,4,B01E6E50HI,"I won't be an ""Amazon Confirmed Purchase"" or whatever because I received a digital download of this movie last week as a gift for having, several years ago, contributed to its production through the crowdfunding campaign. It is a very interesting movie, clearly not a major studio production but artistically effective in conveying the powerful story of Dr. Takeshi Nagai, a Christian convert who survived the initial bomb-blast at Nagasaki only to die of its long-term effects a few years later, but only after having made great strides toward bringing reconciliation and spiritual healing to Japan, in large part through his interpretation of Nagasaki in terms of the Passion and Death of Our Lord.",1464393600,5,700,5.149122807017544
8757857,3,B01E6E50HI,"I wanted to like this more than I did.  This didn't really scratch the surface of Takashi Nagai's story,though there are a couple strong scenes.  It would've worked better as a documentary and not a biopic.  The filmmaker also used a weird filter that made most scenes look overexposed.  It is well acted, but if you care to learn about Nagai, read ""A Song for Nagasaki"".",1535328000,,371,4.575757575757576
8757858,4,B01E6E50HI,"I went into this film with low expectations, based on reviews and based on having been not too crazy about _The Thirteenth Day_ (another Higgins piece). To concur with other reviewers: it would probably be hard to follow for those not yet familiar with Nagai. (I've read _A Song for Nagasaki_ twice.) The filmmaking choices don't always cohere; the acting is not much to write home about. All that said, I was moved, especially in the third act, in the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Especially in those parts of the film, I found new food for reflection and was held captive by the message of hope evoked. So, though it moves slowly, I found it worthwhile in the end.",1498608000,,682,4.598360655737705
8757859,1,B01E6E50HI,The Amazon Video  is a different movie than the DVD.  If you buy the Amazon Video you are purchasing a different MOVIE.  Amazon needs to fix this mistake.,1490313600,,154,4.428571428571429
8757860,1,B01E6E50HI,"I really wanted to like this movie. Our son is named after Takashi Nagai. We greatly admire this man. However, this movie was downright confusing even for people who know the outline of biographical events. It was unclear who many actors were portrating until many scenes later. There are strange special effects, such as drifting dust or snow, in nearly every shot. The CGI is terrible. The music and continuity is bizarre. We had to keep referring to Wikipedia to figure out what was going on. I highly recommend reading Nagai's book and skipping this movie entirely.",1485302400,4,569,4.876288659793815
8757861,5,B01E6E50HI,"Takashi Nagai was born in 1908. His birth was described as difficult and nearly killed both him and his mother. His family lineage was one of doctors as both his father and grandfather were doctors, with the former being trained in Western medicine and the latter practicing herbal medicine. His mother, on the other hand, was the descendant of a samurai family. Nagai was raised in the Confucius and Shinto religion and became interested in Christianity while attending school. When he was 20, his family hoped that he would go to school in Tokyo. He instead went to Nagasaki, and this decision forever changed his life. He became a physician who specialized in radiology and a convert to Roman Catholicism. He was also a survivor of the atomic bombing at Nagasaki, and is currently on the path to Catholic sainthood, being given the title Servant of God. The film All That Remains tells his story.

In this film, we live Nagai's journey. We see his childhood and his mother raising him to be strong. We see him meet his wife, Midori, who helps bring him to Catholicism. We also see Japan's government being taken control of and thus forcing Japan to enter World War II. Dr. Nagai, buries himself in his work, putting his health and family harmony in peril, but this quickly changes when the bomb takes the life of Midori. He now must raise his two children on his own, while battling leukemia. He also tries to help rebuild Nagasaki. This is done through his writings, which help inspire a nation and rebuild through the power of love. It is no wonder he is so highly revered in Japan.

The DVD is approximately two hours long. It contains live action acting, archival footage, and CGI. This creates for a unique viewing experience. Also included on the DVD is a documentary film on Dr. Nagai and an animated short film, entitled ""The 26 Martyrs of Nagasaki."" These make for fascinating viewing after viewing the initial film. I am grateful for getting the opportunity to review this film, as I'm not sure I would have ever learned about the remarkable Catholic man that Dr. Nagai was otherwise. It has also made me interested in reading the book A Song for Nagasaki to help fill in the holes that the film had. (Note: This is not a critical statement against the film. It's just the nature of the media, and that items have to be cut to make a reasonably timed movie.) If you are interested in World War II, Japan, and/or potential Catholic saints, you will want to watch this movie.",1479427200,3,2486,4.634920634920635
8757862,3,B01E6E50HI,"Important subject.  The life of Takashi Nagai is inspiring and encourages further discussion and thought.  The film covered his life to some extent.  Be aware that this film is not linear as an historical account, however.  I think it would be confusing for people who are not familiar with the events of Nagai's life.  The significance of specific scenes can be lost and the symbolism of objects, sounds and lighting overlooked if one has not read Nagai's books or biographies about him.  The film has a stark beauty and intensity; the filmmakers clearly care about Nagai.  I could call this more of an impressionist art film than a biography.",1477526400,2,644,4.853211009174312
8757863,5,B01E6E50HI,"""All That Remains"" is the story of Dr. Takashi Nagai, a husband, a father, a doctor, and a convert to Catholicism who survived the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Mourning his wife killed in the blast, and weakened by his own injuries, he worked with other medical professionals to care for the many victims who survived the blast. Dying of leukemia because of his research into x-rays, Dr. Nagai devoted the last years of his life to caring for his children, illustrating and writing books sharing his insights into the meaning and lessons of the atomic bomb, and welcoming visitors who came to see him in his small hut. His writings helped Japan to recover after the war and challenged the world to recognize the dangers of atomic destruction, pleading that the Nagasaki Holocaust would have meaning if the world learned never to use the atom bomb again.
The director chose to use a variety of techniques: drama, documentary, and Computer Generated Images to share Dr. Nagai's amazing story.",1472947200,2,994,4.887573964497041
8757864,5,B01E6E50HI,"I just finished watching 'All that Remains: The True story of Takashi Nagai' a survivor and hero of Nagasaki. Wow! It is very slow moving in the beginning but as you get into the story, it takes you into such a contemplative journey into this great man's spirituality. I highly recommend it. They weave the stories of the martyrs of Nagasaki, including Magdalena of Nagasaki, into the very fabric of the story. But I think everyone should see it because it presents us with an alternative window into these events which is very holy, very inspiring, very sad, but profoundly life-changing. Takashi Nagai, a Blessed of the Catholic Church, was a hero in Japan and loved the world over by the great peace-makers of his time. But yet, he remains almost completely unknown in the Western world. I highly recommend this to anyone . . . but be patient in the beginning, it moves slowly, but this slow moving becomes a part of the weaving into his soul which becomes an energy you carry with you until the end.",1471996800,2,1003,4.608938547486034
8757865,5,B01E6E50HI,Some stories must never be forgotten.,1471564800,2,37,5.333333333333333
8757866,5,B01E6E50HI,"I read A Song for Nagasaki some years ago, it was phenomenal. The story helped me discover Blaise Pascal and his Pensees. This film, though it is obvious that they were not working with an infinite budget, was very well done. It retold the story well in a way that held my attention like the book did. One thing that could of improved the movie is if they could of got Setsuko Hara to play Midori, but unfortunately she was born far too early. Yuna Shin did a great job too. Highly recommended.",1470960000,3,494,4.32258064516129
