8627059,5,B00GSTHC80,"""Dirty Jobs"" is always entertaining and educational. It is, of course, also dirty, but in this case it's also dangerous. In some cases very, very dangerous. This DVD contains all four episodes Mike Rowe and company made in Australia, and one of them is above and beyond scary. In ""Deadly Snake Wrangler"" Mike helps catch the second most venomous snake in the world, the Brown Snake, using a pillowcase and his bare hands. I couldn't decide which was scarier, getting the huge snake out a kitchen cupboard or getting a clutch of baby snakes out of a swimming pool filter. Either way, my hat's off to Mike for even thinking of attempting this one, particularly after the gentleman conducting his training got a hideous bite (from a non-venomous snake) at the beginning of the day's work. In a ridiculous bit of governmental regulation, it's illegal to kill the snakes, so they have to be turned loose in the wild, free to find another pantry to invade at their leisure.

The other episodes are not as scary as snake wrangling, but present challenges of their own. ""Outback Treasure Hunter"" shows how truly desolate parts of Australia are (watch for Mike's closing song about Coober Pedy and for a truly unusual golf game). ""Journey to Croc Country"" offers some more lessons on the scary things in Australia that can kill you, while the single most trying episode of ""Dirty Jobs"" in history has to be ""Lost in Aboriginal Land"" where dealing with locals ensures that nobody in the cast or crew ever knows what is going to happen next. I definitely got the feeling that Mike was mentally exhausted after this one.

If you want to see Mike Rowe deal with odd or scary animals (did I mention the toad races?) in a place like no other, ""Dirty Jobs Down Under"" is for you!",1484870400,,1763,4.647435897435898
