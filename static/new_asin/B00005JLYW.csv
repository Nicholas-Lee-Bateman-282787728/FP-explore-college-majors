1471293,1,B00005JLYW,"This is Hollywoods attempt to make a Summer Blockbuster that will appeal to women and men (""boys, we gotta make a film for da broads too..""). I cringe whenever I hear Hoochie #1: Cameron Diaz, talk about this dreck and ""positive female roles"" in the same sentence. What a mess.
 First off, lets not forget the golden rule: Lucy Lui = Bad Movie, so you have already been warned.
Then there's the ""action"" scenes: just plain pathetic, really sad. ""Fun"" it is not.
Sure, there is plenty of scenes of the three ""actresses"" bumping and grinding while wearing fetish gear or next to nothing, but so what. Pornos have better plots and acting.
 If you really want to see these hoochies prance around, spare yourself the pain of listening to the insipid dialog and bad acting and rent the film later this year. Then you can fast forward through the dull parts.",1056672000,,851,4.592105263157895
1471294,5,B00005JLYW,"it's better than the one, there is more action.
the actors act very well, particularly Cameron Diaz. the  new bosley is funnier than the other.
the story is more interesting too.
I very enjoyed it, I've seen it twice!",1056672000,,217,4.564102564102564
1471295,5,B00005JLYW,"This is the best movie I've seen this year! And it is also one of Cameron Diaz's best movies!
The special effects are impressing, and not like in the first movie, the story is original and highly interessing. The actresses are fabulous, especially Cameron Diaz (as usual). I liked it so much I saw it twice in a row! Really an outcomming movie! GO SEE IT!",1056585600,,355,4.393939393939394
1471296,3,B00005JLYW,"The eagerly anticipated sequel to the hit Charlie Angels in 2000 returns with a big bang with a double whammy in fun and preposterous sass. Like a glossy MTV of an action-comedy, Natalie (Diaz),Alex (Lucy Liu) and Dylan (Barrymore) provide eye-popping stunts that segue from jumping out of planes, a motorcycle race and dishing out graceful acrobatics and kongfu. Never mind the flimsy plot of ferreting out the mastermind behind the theft of two rings secreting information of FBI witness program. This movie is a joyous celebration of the chemistry and girl power when the trio hams it up like the bestest of friends. Cameos includes the comically larcenous Matt LeBlanc, John Cleese, Crispin Glover as the returning Thin Man, Luke Wilson and ex-angel Jaclyn Smith. Snazzy costumes, retro-dances and an unexpected treat in the form of Demi Moore striking out her first appearance after a three-year hiatus as Madison the villain gets things pumped up with energy and zest. The girls are so infectiously fun that this sequel delivers top notch angel-delic entertainment.",1056499200,,1071,5.160919540229885
1471297,3,B00005JLYW,"I just returned from watching the extremely highly anticipated (2nd highest anticipated film of the year behind October 10th's Kill Bill) Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.  As high as my anticipation was, I was bound to be slightly dissapointed, yet I seemed it unlikely, but boy was I wrong, I was very dissapointed.  The film is still curculating through my head and I'm still wondering if I really even liked the film that much at all.  Of course, I'll be watching it several more times to see how it holds up, but theres no way I'm beating my viewings of the first film (23 times in the theater)  These are some of the things I disliked about the film....
Bernie Mac-  I love Bernie, he is very funny and a lot of fun to watch.....but, he's gotta stop getting these kinda roles, Murrey's Bosley was a very well made character, he felt 2 dimensional, Bernie's Bosley (the Bosley's are brothers, somehow) is your average 1 dimensional token black guy, with a bunch of one liners that can usually be funny, but it doesn't make the character, Bernie is always getting garbage roles, for once I thought it would be different here, but it wasn't.
John Cleese-  John is also a very funny man, but in Angels he plays the father to the most unlikely angel, you guessed it (maybe) Lucy Lui, John is an englishman, Lucy is asian, what were they thinking?
Drew Barrymore-  There was so much fun with the Dylan character in the first film, but this time around shes all mopey and sad most of the time, lessening the fun.
Luke Wilson-  I'm all about Natalie having a man, and the relationship made many scenes in the first film so much fun, but this time around Luke's character is pretty much pointless.
the action-  I'm not saying I hated the action scenes, but none of them held the intensity and excitement that the first one provided even to this day, I love the action in the original.  They try every way to get the angels in as many action settings and outfits as possible, but it gets excessive and a little out of hand.  Although, I don't criticize the unrealness of the scenes, because they do get extremely unreal, and I expected that.
the story-  ....or lack of, which is weird cause woman just kicking butt for no reason seems to sound damn good, but I'm not saying there was no story, they kicked butt for reasons, but the story was......I really don't know how to describe it, of course there was a story but it wasn't even remotely close to the story in the original.
Demi Moore-  Sure, she was hotter than ever before, but being hot doesn't increase your acting abilities, and her bad acting really showed, which is weird because usually that doesn't bother me, but it was so obvious that it did this time.
the opening-  the first films opening is hard to top, but I was so sure they were gonna do it, but just like the rest of the film, very dissapointed.

Finally, the thing about the film that really [*] me off....Crispin Glover-  Creepy Thin Man is so mysterious, and such a great character, I was awaiting his arrival with much enthusiasm, SPOILER AHEAD.....Skip  paragraph if you don't wanna know, he first showed up in a dirt bike race with a helmet on, I knew it was him right away, later you actually get some history of the character, including a first name, then came the best part in the film, during a fight of a rooftop towards the end, Thin Man comes to the rescue, which results into the funniest scene, after kissing,  both Dylan and Thin Man have strands of each others hair in thier hands, Thin smells hers, then Dylan very awkwardly smells his.......then.......remember stop reading if you don't wanna know...........last chance...........okay, I warned you, Thin Man gets a swords (I believe his) through the heart from the back, since they are on an edge of a rooftop this makes him very far to his death.........sorry, believe me, I felt bad too, up to that point it wasn't as good as the first, but at least it was somewhat fun, and it didn't take itself too seriously, but killing Thin Man was a wrong move, and it really bothered me.",1056499200,,4066,4.531420765027322
1471298,2,B00005JLYW,"The original ""Charlie's Angels"" was a goofy, tongue-in-cheek adventure that pitted critics in two camps: Those who could accept the sweet, fun trio of Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lio for who they were and what the movie made them to be, and those who saw an empty, stupid, pointless, constantly-winking-at-itself motion picture that existed for no better reason than to wink.
In round one, I went with the girls.
In round two, I'm leaning toward Charlie's Party Poopers.
Director McG's aptly titled creation, ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" needed less skit and more skirt. McG opted for the skit, realized in endless, one-after-another action setpieces that, in this already drenched-with-CGI climate, are not likely to stand out. There is nothing here to make one rethink the list of the summer's best stunts; nothing up McG's sleeve matches the active virtuosity of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or the opener in ""X2"" or the desert battle in ""Hulk."" In fact, McG is still employing the stop-the-frame, bullet-time CGI that ""The Matrix"" has moved past.
There's is an arrogance at work in McG's approach, as well, that echoes, sadly, Michael Bay, a kind of impending pressure that if you don't find this mayhem abosolutely stunning, if you can't appreciate the various shades of red, blue and pink splashed across the screen, than you're a stiff. In the wake of the big, unexpected success of the first film, McG, along with producer Barrymore and everyone else that cheerfully poured their talents into this mess, clearly thought they had stumbled upon a kitschy, T&A version of James Bond or something.
How else to explain the opening sequence, the one you've seen in the trailers, that bears the mark of ""this is one of our long line of trademark boffo opening sequences!"" How else to explain the plot, an ominous piece of goods about two rings that reveal the identities of every person in the FBi Witness Protection program? And how else to explain the dead-in-the-water return of Demi Moore, who never had much fun in her movies in the first place (I do not recall the woman laughing...ever). The ""fun"" is the same ""fun"" from the first movie. The same boyfriends even come back. And Bosley, now played by Bernie Mac, is the same flat, straight man from the first picture.
I have to admit it takes a little effort to refuse bubble gum this sweet. But harmless as the movie may be, it is tedious, and very empty, and it seems to demand that no one acknowledge that it has flaws that can be fairly attributed to ""fun"" movies. As if to prove that emptiness can never be proverbial, McG keeps cutting and shooting and making his actors mug, all in an effort to prevent and mask over the dead air. But the dead air is still there, underneath, and it's a deadlier kind, because it hints at the sound of fury, signifying just what you think it does.",1056412800,17,2852,4.763636363636364
1471299,4,B00005JLYW,"I just finished watching the Japanese premier release of ""Charlie's Angels--Full Throttle"" and have now very mixed feelings about it.  I gave this one 4 stars, but the fact is it is slightly lower than that.  Though not as much as the original movie's fun, it is still fun anyway.  Maybe I expected much actions.  Well, let me explain.
Don't think about the story, and that's the rule of the original series in 1970s, and the first picture.  The same thing can be said again.  All I can say is that you will see some conspiracy about two stolen rings, a former Angel Madison (Demi Moore), Dylan's ex-boyfriend who suddenly shows up (not that 'Chad' ... thank Heaven), witness protection program, and many, many costumes.  Anyway, you don't summerize the first one's, let's skip this part.
Three Angels -- Cameron Diaz's 'Natalie,' Drew Barrymore's 'Dylan,' and Lucy Liu's ""Alex' are all back.  They are still fun/danger-loving three secret agents, but actions are less compared with the first movie.  Or I should say, if you expect to see the wire actions they showed surprisingly well on the former occasion, you might be disappointed.  The film gives more stress on comic/sexy aspect of the original, and you notice the increased amount of special effects used here.  Actions themselves are done competently, but about the CGIs, not every part is perfect.  Oh, and as to costumes, especially those of Natalie, I might add that her revealing attires are not changing, so ... you know what I mean.
Perhaps most interesting part of ""Full Throttle"" is its supporting or guest stars.  Several members from the original film's cast come back again -- Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and  Crispin Glover as The Thin Man -- but Bosley's role is replaced by 'his brother' Bernie Mac, so you won't see Bill's face except briefly on a photo hanging on the wall.  Many guests are added this time, though, among whom you will see Robert Patrick, Robert Forster, Justin Theroux, John Cleese, and one of the real original Angels.  And you see famous twin sisters in a hilarious way.
But it is Demi Moore who will astonish you, in a good sense, or a bad sense (you choose it).  First she appears just like the first Bond girl (don't miss the surfing scene).  Then she gets more and more ... campy, perhaps intentionally, I hope.  I almost forgot one important thing.  One big star appears as a cameo who gets killed.  And if you know who he is, and later comes to realize who kills him, this is the biggest in-jokes the film offers.
Suppose this film is a comedy, just harmless fun.  Some of you might dislike this one, but the chances are you have already seen the original one, so in that case, especially when you loved its comic side, you won't be disapointed.  But I expected some actions, and I knew that Yuen Cheung-Yan was involved again for the producion (and he is brother of Woo-Ping, famous for his work in ""Matrix"").  Impresssive (but often very ridiculous) bike stunts or skateboarding ride are there, but I find they are not enough.  Instead, you see lots of gags, verbal or physical, gross-out or sexual.  And they included many, many references to other famous films, which are certainly funny.  So, when one of the angels appears as cheerleader, you hear the song ""Mickey"" (yeah, ""Bring it On"")  And when these Angels stake out, welding, yes, you hear Irene Cara song.  Maybe too predictable, but it's just OK.
Don't think this sequel is improvement on the first film.  It is like ""Austin Powers""; the first one's sensation and funny is reduced, but the good supporting actors/actresses are still helpful.  More jokes, less actions, but still fun.",1056153600,8,3646,4.748807631160572
1471300,2,B00005JLYW,"I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE, I'M SURE THE GIRLS DO A FINE JOB JUST LIKE THEY DID IN THE FIRST ONE.

1471301,5,B00005JLYW,"Come June 27th the Angels will be back in theatres with its follow up sequel to the 2000 Action blockbuster hit Charlies Angels with Charlies Angels: Full Throttle. Seeing as the movie isn't out for another few weeks, I'll simply be going over some aspects of what to expect from this upcoming action hit. Comparing and contrasting the original to the sequel. Furthermore, I will also review the movie and edit this review when its released in cinemas.
But what's to be expected from this movie Franchise?
So far we can only go with what the trailers and blurbs tell us.
So lets start with the plot - The Angels are ready to strike without warning and kick some serious [rear-end] as they go undercover to retrieve two missing silver bands. These are no ordinary wedding rings. They contain valuable encrypted information that reveals the new identities of every person in the federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses start to turn up dead, only the Angels can stop the perpetrator, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts.
Any people who have seen the first movie would know that the film wasn`t meant to be a `serious' action flick. Drew Barrymore, who had the idea for doing a Charlie's Angels movie, is responsible for the tone that the movie would portray. Although the film is a revised and recast take off of the old 70's show, it can still make fun of itself which is always a good aspect to have in filmmaking.
But we should meet the Angels before we go any further. First, we have Alex (Lucy Liu), trying to develop her cooking skills to try and be incognito as an aspiring housewife. Although her cooking falls sub-par as the muffins she cooks can break through doors. Then there's Dylan (Drew Barrymore) trying to find her other half, to only be teamed up with the `Chad'. And finally we have Natalie (Cameron Diaz), the geeky virgin who lives her fantasy showbiz lifestyle in dreams. And remember `Feel free to stick things in her slot'. All team together to become the cool, sexy, lethal weapon packing, espionage trio that are Charlie's Angels.
We then have the Charlie's Angels other half....Charlie. Of course Charlie is one of the most famous voice overs in television (and now movie) history. But of course seeing as he is undercover, his identity can never be revealed. So he puts all of his mission stats through Bosley, played by Bill Murray in the original. But seeing as movie's change through sequels, Bill Murray will not be present in this film. Instead Bernie Mac will take his place to be the new comic relief that we all love. Speaking of new additions we have Demi Moore instated to play the antagonistic femme fatale. Also `Creepy Thin Guy' is back once again, I believe. The cast who have signed on for this sequel, as you can see, are above average and should contribute to us putting down our money to see this movie. My fingers are still crossed for the sensational Tim Curry to be present in Full Throttle.
But what also made the first film so successful (and may contribute to spending our time seeing the sequel) was the outrageous stunts and the plentifulness of outfits with the mix of humour and energy from both cast and crew. This can also be seen in the trailers for `Full Throttle'. We have the Angels dressed up in all kinds of outfits, ranging from Cowgirl to Biker girl ensembles.  We have explosions from tanks and rockets. We have the humour and layed back persona's of the Angels. And all these ingredients make for a good recipe of Action-Comedy with a very heroine angle (Which is always nice to see).
Although, whether the director McG (yes, that is his name) will deliver an enjoyable sequel will only be known by June 27th. But if you're in the mood for a fun, raunchy, action packed movie. I suggest to give Charlies Angels: Full Throttle a viewing.
Stay tuned for my review when its been released in cinemas.",1053648000,4,3910,4.666666666666667

1471583,2,B00005JLYW,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is an action comedy film. It is the sequel to 2000's Charlie's Angels. In an ensemble cast, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu return as Natalie, Dylan, and Alex respectively. It also features Demi Moore, Shia LaBeouf, Robert Patrick, Crispin Glover, Justin Theroux, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson, John Cleese, and, replacing Bill Murray in the role of Bosley, Bernie Mac. It was directed by McG.

The three most glamorous and butt-kicking private detectives in the business are back and ready to take on bad guys in this sequel to the screen adaptation of the once-popular television series. Dylan, Natalie, and Alex are once again summoned to the office of their boss Charlie, where they're introduced to his new right-hand man Bosley and given their latest assignment. It seems a pair of rings have gone missing and need to be recovered, but this was no ordinary jewel heist -- the rings have been coded with special information that can be used to access a list of every person in the FBI's Witness Protection Program, and when a handful of protected informants are murdered, the Angels are brought in to help crack the case. As the women search for the culprits, they encounter Madison Lee, one of Charlie's former agents who decided that the wrong side of the law pays better, and Seamus, who once dated Dylan and wants revenge for her decision to turn him over to the police.

This was a bad sequel as it has no sensible plot and flat line performances from most of the cast. The special effects sequences, silly jokes, tantalizing outfits and overbearing soundtrack seem painfully forced and fake. And most of all,it was shallow.",1428278400,,1673,4.866666666666666

Unless you think it is perfectly rational that one could survive jumping through a window of a cliff house on stilts buck naked or change clothes mid-run or survive jumping a Formula 1 car off a bridge or use a arrow to grappling hook a helicopter. Those stuck on Bosley's change like Bill Murray a little too much. Bosley's performance in Full Throttle was an improvement. The replacement of Bosely needed no explanation; but it was, in fact, explained very well. The cameos were very funny and the use of color was second only to Speed Racer. My wife and I both loved the sequel. Recommended for people who's expectations don't get in the way of enjoying a sequel that ""one up's"" its predecessor.",1415318400,,875,4.615384615384615

Based at least on hair color Dylan, Natalie, and Alex were like Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup all grown up.  Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu were smashing portraying their respective roles and they kicked butt against the bad guys.  Jaclyn Smith reprised her role of Kelly Garrett from the original series and she came across to Dylan the same way PPG teacher Ms. Keane was towards Townsville's darlings but Demi Moore's character Madison Lee who was the angel gone bad was as much the serpent as PPG adversary Sedusa in snaring all three of the good angels.  They, however would eventually save the day and foil the rogue angel's plot.  Worth mentioning also is that was the last time John Forsythe would portray the unseen Charlie Townsend and the late Bernie Mac as Bosley who unfortunately died just 5 years after the movie was in theaters.

1471656,3,B00005JLYW,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is an interesting but not-very-funny action-comedy.  I say ""interesting"" because of all the wildly complex stunts, the fierce gun battles, the references to other movies across a wide variety of genres, the many cameo appearances, and the inside jokes from the movie industry.  The segment featuring MC Hammer and Cameron Diaz imitating his hyper-kinetic dance routine was a hilarious surprise and, unintentionally, the best part of the movie!  The portrayal of Bosley as a clueless, cowardly black idiot was a serious mistake. The original Bosley, while he was the odd-man-out, was none of those. Bernie Mac's role as Bosley will make many viewers uneasy primarily because it is a worn-out throwback to the racist American film-making of the 1930s and 40s. It is a sign of director McG's social and political immaturity. This Bosley made me squirm with embarrassment, especially since the late Bernie Mac was a very talented comedic actor. But, generally, I liked the movie because the Angels were charismatic, sexy, smart, very athletic, and highly individualized but with a genuine sense of camaraderie, and the villains, especially Demi Moore, are oh so bad!  As I've already indicated, it is an interesting comedy to study, but not especially funny, except for Cameron Diaz doing MC Hammer's signature dance.  She was great!",1402444800,,1361,5.253456221198157

For a movie based on a campy tv series from the 70s, it certainly delivers.  All the guest appearances alone are worth the view.  It is a shame that Bernie Mac was miscast as Bosley because he is certainly talented, but not right for the part.  His role feels very forced, but that was the only drawback for me.  A lot of action pictures take themselves so seriously.  I think action pictures are more enjoyable with a sense of humor.

Teaming up with the original film's director McG (who,to date,has yet to helm any film aside from these two),the original cast return also for a sequel which manages to be just as loud,colourful,sexy,fun and exciting as it's predecessor.  Aside from a seemingly endless array of celebrity cameos,there are some exciting new additions to the credited cast list as well. To begin with,we have the growingly popular Bernie Mac replacing Bill Murray as Bosley. It's a pretty huge plot contrievance to explain how a black man has taken over a role originally played by a white man,but I'm sure Bill had his reasons for pulling out and Mac is well worth the replacement,as he provides the film with some sassing black attitude in the Shaft vein,matched by some hilariously funny moments on his behalf. Speaking of humour,comedy legend John Cleese turns up as Alex's (Lucy Liu) father (her mother must have been black).His appearance in a film is no guarantee of quality,as the James Bond film The World is Not Enough proved,but here he adds a pleasant air of fun by providing the already good time flick with some more amusing comic relief. And finally,we have a screen comeback (she'd disagree with me on that count,but it's my review,hahaha) from Demi Moore as the villainess of the piece,who,it has to be said,looks absolutely fabulous at 40,displaying a body and curves for a woman of her advancing years to be very proud of. How much of this is down to surgery or just ageing well is unclear,but it sure rubbed off on this viewer.  Of the remaining central cast,Liu and Drew Barrymore are appealing enough,but the star (or,at least,the babe) of the show remains the gorgeous Cameron Diaz,the ultimate chick of the piece,sassy,seductive and just fine to look at.  There's some fine dialogue and one liners on offer here as well,complimented by a brilliant soundtrack and a lot of explosive,exciting action sequences. Sure,the vast majority of them are totally implausible,but it's not as if this pretended to be anything other than a no brainer piece of eye candy.  And of course,although in fairness it's equally as good,it can't match up to the original on the grounds that the original is the original. And the story is somewhat incoherent,wavey and off course. But given the success of the original,it was inevitable that this was going to be made anyway,and if it stands a chance of being any more of a ride than the first two films,a third instalment is greatly anticipated.

Who can forget those sci-fi and horror classics, Ronald Reagan and the chimp classics, or Doris Day masterpieces that were so real, so full of thought-provoking dialogue, and so powerfully driven by their ironclad plots? Must be nice to have such a selective memory. As for me, I know that Hollywood is by and large a crap factory and it's simply a matter of the flavor you choose. If Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is anything it is a harmless bit of cinematic fun. I'm not stupid as some reviewers suggest because I enjoyed it. In fact, I dare say that calling someone stupid because they like something so innocuous is, well, stupid, but I digress.
I found this franchise and in particular this installment highly amusing, entertaining, and fun to watch and I've seen it a good half dozen times on tv here and there and I enjoy it every time. Bernie Mac is his irascible funny self, Demi Moore plays the villain with relish and joy, the cameos by the Wilson brothers, Crispin Glover, et al are additional cheese, and the ladies do a good job as fun-loving butt-kicking detectives. Let's remember we're talking about an MTV version of a tv show that was little more than an excuse for prime time soft core titillation. Anyone who attempts to argue the strength of the original series is also the same person who will tell you that Playboy is really best enjoyed for the articles.
If you went into this movie looking for anything other than beaucoup explosions, cartoon action sequences, and painfully corny dialogue than you missed the boat completely. We're talking mindless amusement and not high art and in Hollywood's long history, they've always done much more of the former than the latter if for no other reason than because movies are ENTERTAINMENT FIRST AND FOREMOST.

A puerile hodgepodge of special effects, allegedly hot women in skintight clothes, explosions, and more explosions. Watching this inane movie I had to plug my ears with cotton to keep my brains from pouring out of them. I've seen MST3K movies that made more sense.

Say what you will about the original 70's TV show it was never as mindless as this waste of celluloid. In addition to the ""jiggle"", there was some semblance of a plot and a story in each episode. This movie is nothing more than a bunch of ridiculous action scenes and special effects pasted together and set to 1980's music. The script has no dialogue the characters have no personality, and the special effects are just there to be there.

The plot if you can call it one: Two rings contain the world's -whatever are stolen by a rogue angel played by washed up Demi Moore trying to make a comeback ten years too late. Charlie sends his three stooges (Barrymore looks like Larry to me in this movie, Liu, acts like Moe, and Cameron Diaz might make a decent Curly if she shaved her head.) to go after her and get the rings back. Everything leads up to a big fight between the three stooges and Shemp. (Moore)

Director McG is has revolutionized filmmaking with this movie: He's the first man able to direct a movie dumber than a box of rocks. No, strike that, it's offensive to both the intelligence of the box and the rocks inside it. I actually think if I put a picture a box of rocks onscreen for two hours it would be more entertaining and make more sense than this movie. The fast moving frames of this brain melting drivel don't come together to form a cohesive story; they just seem to be there because he wants them there.

I don't know who's more retarded the braindead executives who greenlit these orange crayon scribbles calling itself a screenplay, the producers who invested over a hundred million dollars to make this dreck, or the stars who agreed to act in it after reading the puerile script written by chimpanzees high on LSD and Red Bull. Perhaps we the audience are the most mentally deficient because we keep spending money to see this trash even though we know it's garbage. I just know this: I will never watch another movie directed by guys with pretentious one-word names like McG, or Pitof.

There are no good performances here. Everyone in this movie is just here for the paycheck. Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore are just three cardboard cutouts with cell phones taped to them. Bernie Mac needs something to do in between takes for the Bernie Mac show, and Demi Moore is just here to show off what $20,000 worth of plastic surgery bought her. She'd have been better off spending her money on acting lessons, yoga, and groceries for her household or something else worthwhile.

IF YOU VALUE YOUR BRAIN AVOID THIS MOVIE! If you want to watch a silly ""jiggle"" movie, pick up Hamburger: the Movie, Porky's or Hot Dog: The movie.

Yes! We know it's suppose to be a campy chick flick of the T.V. show and not to be taken seriously, but they could have done much better with the casting and the movie as a whole. Instead, we get this Matrix/Batman wannabe, flying off the bridge, too many cameos B.S.  This movie was a disaster, and did a serious unjustice to the original series.

Since, we all grew up in the seventies watching shows like Swat, Starsky & Hutch, the Rookies and of course this, me and my sister-in-law, was discussing is, why the studios just didn't make this into a more dramatic feature film with a better cast?

I like you Drew and Demi, but I feel both of you just, didn't fit these roles.  As far as Camron Diaz and Lucy Lou

(and they are not all that) What were they smoking when they decided to cast them?  Neither one of them (in my opinion) is  NOT HOT!!!  I mean, dam!  Both of them are so caked with

make-up, their faces look 3-D.  They don't turn this man's head twice at all, their looks are average at best, so enough about them already.

What I was about to say earlier is, what they should have done is, taken the original characters from the T.V. show (Jill, Sabrina and Kelly) recast them with Hollywood's better more mature looking actresses, for example the so-called it girl today I guess, you know?  Someone like Angelina Jolie, could have been cast as the new Kelly Garrett.  Of course every

Anglo-Saxon red blooded male has to have his ""Blonde Bombshell"" so what the hell!  Why not the new Farrah of the 90's back then, Miss Pamela Anderson as the new Jill Monroe?  The character is practically tailer made for her.

This might sound a little controversial, not making this out to be a race issue either, but even though Charlie's Angeles didn't have a black angel, I think Halle Berry could have pulled it off cast as the new Sabrina Duncan.  If not her, than Katerine Zeta Jones.  BOOM!!!  There's your stars for the new Charlie's Angeles feature film, that should have been cast that way, several years ago, if the movie studios were serious about making this a good dramatic movie.

But, forget it, the damage is done now, so we're stuck with Miss Berrymore and these two other goofy looking, clown acting, not even qute actresses.  I'll be honest here, you young turks can rave about them all you want to (each to its own), but Diaz and Lou just don't cut it for me.  Not only that, but they both became more annoying to me through out the middle of the movie for some reason.

I think I lost interest in this junk somewhat, after Jacklyn Smith cameo apperance.  She still looks pretty good, to be honest she was the only high light(literally) to me of the movie.",1143244800,,2884,4.431558935361217

Dallas and get this, The Dirty Dozen!?! Now is NOTHING sacred any longer? Can't wait for Miami Vice (sic) I'm sure that will be just great.

Not to be picky. but cameron and drew are getting up here as far as age, lucy liu is the hottest and the cutest. Dont get me wrong some scenes cameron looked great in bikini's, and drew looked scary at the end. with that big ol chin of hers,not to be mean. and drew use to be a hottie?? but there were only a few scenes when she looked hot and it was when she had two gallons of makeup on, cameron also.. cameron was also hotter years before especially in THE MASK with jim carrey. wow what a babe. Demi moore still is in great shape, but you can always spot wrinkles on her face especially when she smiles. cameron as well. I shouldnt be making these comments because i too will know whats its like to lose my looks as i get older, i'm 24 now but times flies. I especially enjoyed the music in this film. yes some terrible lines and some cheesy dialogue and barely a plot. still great action. although exteremely unrealistic it was still a fun film at the movies just us girls. still a great time. and i especially like it when they changed into new outfits and disguises in almost every scene.

1472062,5,B00005JLYW,"In 2000, director McG had given us CHARLIE'S ANGELS, the movie, where Charlie had recruited his third batch of Angels. Well, in the summer of 2003, Charlie's Angels are back for another round of kick-a** action.

  NATALIE COOK (again played by Cameron Diaz), DYLAN SAUNDERS (again played by Drew Barrymore), and ALEX MUNDAY (again played by Lucy Liu) have moved on from their first assignment and have been settling on new ones. Their newest assignment is to retrieve the HALO rings. They were stolen by someone unknown to them. BOSLEY is back with the angels, but apparently, JOHN BOSELY has left the agency. He was replaced by his stepbrother, JIMMY BOSLEY (played by Bernie Mac). CHARLIE (again played by the voice of John Forsythe) is back to give the angels their assignment.

  They track their clues down to a drag racing track, where one of the racers seems to be a suspect. In the race is 15-year-old MAX (played by Shia LaBeouf). The suspect tries to kill Max, but some unknown drag race kills the suspect. The unknown racer that killed the angels' suspect is...CREEPY THIN MAN (again played by Crispin Glover). Seems he survived the explosion in the first film. At that moment of meeting Max, their computer brings up a file on a woman named Helen Zaas. Helen Zaas turns out to be...Dylan.

  Helen Zaas was Dylan's real name before she went into the Witness Protection Program eight years earlier. She was dating a guy named Seamus O'Grady, who is one of the crooks involved in the theft of the Halo Rings. She witnessed O'Grady kill somebody, forcing Dylan to put him away. O'Grady even killed Max's parents. Max had been in an orphanage. The angels realize that Thin Man had gone to the same orphanage a long while back. The angels head out there, while Bosely takes Max to his house under protection.

  They receive information on Thin Man and head out on their way. They find their way to a huge garage-like storage facility, where they find the Halo Rings. But they are interrupted by...O'Grady and his gang. They battle it out, where O'Grady, to Dylan, threatens to kill her mates.

  That night, while Alex talks with her father, MR. MUNDAY (played by John Cleese), and her boyfriend, JASON GIBBONS (again played Matt LeBlanc), who is filming MAXIMUM EXTREME 2, the sequel to his first film and who is on a break with Alex, while Natalie and PETE (again played by Luke Wilson, who has just moved in with Natalie, attend Pete's high school reunion, Dylan leaves the agency, for she does not want her two best friends getting hurt.

  Natalie and Alex try going on without her. They have gotten back the two Halo Rings and handed them both to RAY CARTER (played by Robert Patrick), who had been injured and rescued by the angels on their previous assignment. His injury resulted in a few fractured ribs, but the way he caught his car keys from Bosely indicated that he faked the injury, leading Alex and Natalie to find out that he had been working with the mystery person who wanted the rings. The mystery person kills Carter. That mystery person turns out to be...MADISON LEE (played by Demi Moore). Madison had been an Angel before Natalie, Alex, and Dylan. For some reason, she has gone bad.

  Dylan, after receiving advice and wisdom from KELLY GARRETT (played by Jaclyn Smith), one of Charlie's first-ever angels, returns to battle Madison. She shoots the angels off the roof and goes out on her way. But the Angels survived the shootings. That night, while Jason arrives at his premier for MAXIMUM EXTREME 2, the angels battle Madison Lee. After a brief and painful a**-kicking, the angels send Madison, a former angel, into Hell.

1472155,5,B00005JLYW,"McG directs like a music video director. He uses tons of slowmotion and all sorts of unnecessarily swishy camera moves. He only bothers with enough plot to move the Angels from one location to the next. And almost every second of the movie contains some kind of background music, usually at full volume.

I should add that most of the humor in the film (with the exception of one scene) elicits smiles rather than laughs. Nobody in the film acts very well. The plot is more like a sketch on draft paper than an actual blueprint.

And yet this would be the most purely enjoyable film I've seen in the last two years.

CT: FT never takes itself seriously. It *knows* it's a dumb movie. It *knows* its audience has come to see a dumb movie. So McG doesn't have any hesitation in showing us stuff like the Angels driving a truck over a dam wall and flying a helicopter (!) to safety. Or a motorcross race that includes one guy flipping himself upside-down above his handlebars and firing two pistols at our heroes. Or a main character (Demi Moore's, in fact) literally flying.

Music video directors are supposed to come from the armpit of Satan or something, but McG's bacground doesn't seem to have hurt his style much. He times things perfectly, always knowing when to cut to give maximum impact to the fight scenes. (You may find yourself wincing in sympathy for some of the bad guys). He keeps it all moving, switching from scene to scene at just the right time and somehow holding our interest despite the flimsy plot. And he somehow avoids cliche (unless the point of a scene is to knowingly invoke cliche) - this doesn't look like any other movie.

So many of the criticisms of this movie are off base. ""The plot is weak"" - it doesn't matter. ""Style over substance"" - tell us something we can't see for ourselves. Think of it like this: CA: FT is an amusement park ride. There's nothing *wrong* with amusement park rides. We're all happy to shell out our money for them 'cause we get shot full of adrenaline and leave laughing at the end. Now movies *can* be so much more - a film like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now is a work of art that can deepen your understanding of the world - but did The Godfather make you want to stand on your seat and shout ""HELL YEAH!""?

Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a Hell Yeah movie. And if you didn't like it, watch out, because there's a lot more movies like it coming.",1111104000,4,2413,4.447963800904978

A dumb movie can be good, if it knows its crowd and doesn't take it itself too seriously, but this movie has an element of extreme _strangeness_ which makes it impossible to enjoy. The pacing and the dialogue are all wrong. It doesn't seem to know what effect it wants to have, and jokes are delivered in a bizzare deadpan fashion which forbids laughter. Also it clips along at a fairly breakneak speed, giving no pause for laughter; one joke (which isn't really funny anyway) is piled on top of another, as though to compensate for quality with volume. Then there's the plot, which tries too hard to actually exist and keeps distracting from the action. Information is always being introduced by way of some clumsy exposition, in a way that makes you feel you should be paying attention, even though you know the plot doesn't matter. Then there's the tone. That indecision is really what characterizes Full Throttle. You don't know what you're supposed to take seriously. It just can't strike the right balance between comedy and drama. There are moments near the end which are really grotesque or depressing, and they just take all of the force out of the jokes, but then the jokes make it impossible to take the drama seriously.
Still, the overall production is impressive, and it does have a few nice moments (the menacing Irish gangster, about as out-of-place in this movie as a classy villain like Hannibal Lechter would be), and John Cleese as Lucy Liu's father in a typically good performance. It might just be worth seeing, if only to see the unique way in which they managed to botch it.",1087776000,2,1694,4.6879194630872485
1472281,1,B00005JLYW,"I have had the priviledge of watching the worst film ever. It was Plan 9 from Outer Space, by Ed Wood. It was brilliant. Ed Wood took no money, no talent, no acting ability, no coherance and no plot and turned it into the most entertaining movie I have ever seen.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, meanwhile, took millions of dollars, reasonable (I'll go no further) talent and acting ability, and no coherence or plot, and churned out the worst pile of crap I have ever had the misfortune to be in the same room as.
From the moment the film opens, you know your braincells are doomed. The idiocy-rays beaming from the screen penetrate through your eyes and you suffer the anguished screams of your braincells dying as all logic is stripped away.
And despite what anyone else says, I was resolutely unattracted to the Angels; I find it impossible to like someone whose idea of a snappy line is 'Just once I'd like to leave a bar by the door.' Throughout the movie you can hear the original Angels spinning in their graves. And if they're not dead, this movie will kill them off.",1087084800,5,1077,4.528205128205128

The Special effects are A+ grade and the camera moves swiftly and smoothly through the films many amazing setpieces especially the breathtaking final rooftop scene where the angels battle it out with the sizzling Demi Moore.

1472402,1,B00005JLYW,"Much could be said about the first Charlie's Angels movie from late in 2000. It was fun, and full of action without going over the top to where it would've ruined the film. It's nothing to make history out of but it is plenty of fun and worth watching if you turn your `thinking' brain into off mode. Unfortunately I could never say the same positive things about it's disastrous sequel ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"". I had a lot of expectations for more fun in ""Full Throttle"" but This sequel is like a rehash of the original except that all of the fun innocent flamboyance of the first one is thrown right out the window and the massive void left is nothing but a massive hodgepodge of eardrum-busting loud special effects, highly unrealistic stunts and nauseating and tacky innuendos which together completely ruin this lame excuse for a film.
 The plot is just hilariously bad and goes nowhere from the very start. The threesome trio are now assigned on a mission to recover some device that has top secret inscriptions in it that has gone missing and the witnesses to the crime have been turning up dead right and left and the three hunt down the culprit of the slayings and they discover that the villainess is actually a `fallen angel' named Madison Lee (Demi Moore) who betrayed them and went bad and now the mission is to recover the device before Madison gets a hold of it.
 A lot of the stunts are laughable and highly unrealistic even for most of the best stuntmen in the world and some of the chases and motorcycle stunts by both the good and bad guys would make even Evel Knievel cringe. How do they dodge bullets that are fired at them while they are in mid-air? Hell both the good and bad guys fire enormous hailstorms of bullets at each other while in mid-air on the motorcycles but not one of the rounds come close to their targets even though they are no more than a few feet away. Strange huh? The various special effects are just messy and excessively loud and overblown plus some scenes felt more like ripoffs of some sequences from the ""Matrix"" trilogy but faring much worse.
 The characters in the movie are absolutely stupid and completely kill off anything that could've been even remotely good about this film. The threesome trio resort to some of the dumbest female heroine behavior that I've ever seen in any movie and resorting to trashy behavior like some drunken stripper after having no sleep for several days. I'm no prude but this movie is just a sickening example of the exploitation of both genders and rendering the women characters as nothing but objects and the men as nothing but like canines going into season. I'm sorry but the characters come off as being absolutely stupid and without any personality.
 The cast of this movie is really excellent and could've been made a really spectacular movie but almost every actress and actor completely drops the ball on this one with completely bone dry acting and the script is weak and has no chance of being anywhere near consistent. The jokes by the minor background characters are not even funny and are just plain stupid to say the least. Demi Moore as the villainess Madison Lee isn't bad in my opinion but she really squandered her chance at creating a really formidable villainous character and comes off as being nothing more than a caffeine-drenched cat that has gone into it's season. And Moore went through heavy exercise training just for a measley few minutes throughout the whole film? They really squandered their chance at making Madison Lee a really formidable villainess. What a waste of a great opportunity! Bernie Mac is really funny as Bosley and I really liked Bernie's portrayal of Bosley because he is a really excellent comedian but even he could not save this sequel from becoming thermal depolymerization plant material. Madison Lee and Bosley were the only good things about this movie but their meager screen time could not add up to enough to save this movie from falling into the extreme end of mediocrity.
 This movie is a sad example of how the seedy parts of Hollywood are brought up from the bottom of the barrel right up to the big screen where both men and women are reduced to nothing but nymphomaniac puppies in season. I for one and not turned on by excessive innuendos. The first movie was saved by limiting such excessive tackiness but this sequel is loaded with completely repulsive innuendos throughout the movie and it's not even appealing at all. It's disgusting and absolutely insulting to anyone who values the other gender.
 This sequel ruins the fun legacy of the ""Charlie's Angels"" franchise and this movie has no destiny other than heading straight from the garbage truck right into the landfill or better yet, the thermal depolymerization plant where it belongs. It's really sad how we are wasting our natural resources in manufacturing awful movies like this. Don't even rent this garbage. There is no point in wasting one's time on such a lousy and pathetic film like this. If there is to be a third installment in the series, I have very low expectations for it being good but even then, I fear it will disappoint once again the same way ""Full Throttle"" did with me.
This could really have been a great sequel but they totally blew it with this one. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1086220800,7,5327,4.685897435897436

Demi Moore is the one exception. She still looks good in a bikini, even without the natural advantage of being twenty-something. She snarls her way through her role with just the right campiness. Even so, she's not enough to salvage this one.

1472404,1,B00005JLYW,"this is about as bad as it gets. I was really bored and pulled it up on my cables on demand, and I turned it off after the diving off the damn scene (which was in the first 5-8 minutes). A high budget cheesy movie is about as bad as a low budget one. This stinks, and I don't care who is in it!",1085616000,3,294,3.609375
1472405,2,B00005JLYW,"You're walking down the sidewalk, minding your own business, when you hear the squeal of tires and the dreadful sound of metal hitting metal at high velocity.  Yes, it's a car accident.  You look over, and see two cars joined at the fender, smoke billowing out of both engines.  Sirens start wailing and lights start flashing.  You really have somewhere to be, something better to do, but you can't pull yourself away.  Somebody could be dead in there!  We're all attracted to blood, even when we are sickened by it.
I felt that way two weeks ago, when I turned on Movie Central and saw that Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was on.  I meant to just leave it on and read my book while my wife did whatever she was doing on the computer.  But I found myself constantly looking up, and finally just put the book down.  Much like the above mentioned wreck, I was sickened yet fascinated.  Also like the above accident, it was sort of neat to see the explosions but I wasn't happy with myself afterward for staying and observing it.
I will give the movie credit for one thing.  It takes you by the throat at the beginning and says ""don't expect any semblance of realism in the following 105 minutes.  You won't be getting any.  Take my advice, or you'll be even more disappointed.""  After finally letting me down (my throat still hurts), I was equipped to watch it without engaging any brain cells whatsoever.  It was amazing.  I tried to take a poll afterwards, but all of the cells were out for the night (there was a sign on the door that said ""since you won't be using us tonight, we'll be down at the pub"").  The movie does this by having a completely impossible sequence where a helicopter starts up and takes off as it's falling off of a dam (face-down).  It does a neat 90 degree turn, just as it's about to hit the water, and flies away.  And that's the most believable thing in the movie!
The plot, what there is of it, is about a rogue Angel trying to sell an encrypted list of FBI witness protection people to the highest bidder.  It's no spoiler that Moore is the bad gal in this one, as the marketing of the movie trumpeted the fact.  Our three Angels begin the movie by rescuing Ray Carter from North Korea, and then being tasked with finding out who killed the other person who has a key to the encryption.  There are a couple of ""twists"" that are seen miles away, and Moore gets to be super-threatening (showing how evil she is by double-crossing somebody and blowing them away).
While it's a thin plot, it's also incoherent, held together by the barest of bikini straps as we are led from one soft-core male fantasy to another.  In one sequence, in order to get a valuable key and security card from a dock worker, the Angels do a long involved strip-tease.  I didn't time it, but I would guess the sequence took almost five minutes.  As a full-blooded male, I can't say I was that disappointed, but it's a good thing my brain cells were off getting drunk, because they would have rebelled otherwise.  It's obvious that the three ladies were just having fun with this flick, and perhaps this scene just let them be the exhibitionist they always wanted to be.
Barrymore's character also gets a little bit of angst, as we find out that she was on the list for something that happened years ago.  She quits the team and heads of to Mexico, where she has a vision of one of the earlier Angels (Jacqueline Smith, who doesn't look too bad, but you have to wonder what she would look like without the soft-focus lens) that prompts her to come back into the fold.  I thought it was a nice homage back to the original series, and something that the first movie could have used, but oh well.  The other characters don't get much to do other than fight and look beautiful.  They're all given love-interests, but there's no chemistry between them.  Liu's character is given an English father, which could have been interesting if anything had been done with it.  However, that wouldn't do in a popcorn movie like this one, so instead we get a Three's Company rip-off that's painful to watch.  Thankfully, both scenes are pretty short.
Moore is interesting, however.  She treats it like the fluff role it is, but she gives it just enough bite to wish that she had killed off the other three and taken over the agency herself.  She lights up the screen whenever she's on, and it's probably her best role in a while.  The other actor who acquits himself well is Bernie Mac.  He brings a lot of fun to the picture, and I loved his ""Black Irish"" exchange with one of the dock workers.  I found his presence completely implausible, especially with the reference to the previous Bosley (Bill Murray), but I loved the way Mac portrayed his character.  There is an homage to Murray's not being around, but it would been nice to include the other previous Bosley from the series in the homage.  Oh well, I guess you can't have everything.
Everybody else either chews the scenery with relish or just has a blast without exercising any of their acting chops.  The action is frenetic and well-choreographed, and there's something to be said for watching beautiful women kick a bunch of guys' butts, so the movie has that as well.  However, the above compliments encompass the only good things in this movie.  If you happen to stumble across it during your movie travels, and you can't find anything else to watch, then you may be rewarded.  But c'mon.  There's got to be some yard work to do or something.

Everyone involved with this picture should be ashamed beyond belief, and anyone who gave this movie a positive review, you have a serious problem.",1085011200,6,710,4.386363636363637
1472407,4,B00005JLYW,"""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" is most simply a perfect popcorn movie. You pop this in the DVD player, turn the speakers up, sit down, turn your brain off, and watch the action sequences unfold, one after another. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are back, sans Bill Murray's Bosley in the second installment for more insane action sequences, fight scenes, and gratuitous booty shots. The plot is really quite simple. The government hid the names of people in the Witness Protection Program on two rings, one containing the real names and the other containing the aliases. Someone has stolen them and its the Angel's job to get them both back. Seems simple enough. Its not.
From the first explosion to the last landed blow, this film is a mess, but it benefits from being so. If it were to take itself as a serious action movie, it would've been the first ""Mission: Impossible"" (which actually had the same plot) just with three really hot chicks. Since the producers of the movie decided to let everyone know the major surprise twist in the casting announcements and even the films trailer, finding out that Demi Moore was the villian didn't come as a shock but they did do a good job of hiding it from people who hadn't seen the trailer.
Bernie Mac does a pretty good job of replacing Bill Murray as Bosley, who wasn't such a big part of the first film anyway. John Cleese is good as Lucy Liu's father, seeming disappointed and shocked in his daughter's chosen line of work (after a bit of a mix-up due to Alex's ex-boyfriend, Matt LeBlanc). Justin Theroux, Shia LeBeouf, and Crispin Glover (reprising his Creepy Thin Man role) are all good, even though the latter never says a word except ""AAAHHHH!!!"".
The one thing that really bothered me about this film was the last act, where Demi Moore jumps off a building and literally flies for 5 blocks with these attachments on her dress. It was aforementioned in the film that she had won a Nobel Prize for her research on flying mammals, so that figures that she would know how to do it, but come on. Even in action movies some things are a little over the top. The special effects are real bad there. Otherwise, they were okay. Nothing Oscar worthy in this film.
The score for this movie is exponentially better than that of the first film. There is an internal conflict within Drew Barrymore's character so there are some real somber musical moments. The show's theme is used a few times and of course, the ""plot thickens"" theme is used to great effect. Even the songs in the movie were good, like ""Breathe"" and ""Firestarter"", during the Coal Bowl and sailor fight, respectively, by Prodigy.
Buy it if you want a good, funny action movie to spend a Friday night watching. Avoid it if you don't like over-the-top action. Lord knows theres plenty of it in this movie. He should after all...it is a movie about Angels.",1084752000,,2879,4.636007827788649

There are a few laugh out loud moments, especially when I realised that the old grey haired man (who appears for one scene, and who I couldn't see in the credits) was infact Bruce Willis.
What's great about this movie once more, is the Angels never use guns - unless you count the fallen Angel, played by Demi Moore. Who used this movie to make her comeback. And how much did she look like Catherine Zeta Jones in certain shots? When her hair wasn't poker straight, and was actually nice and wavy, and the makeup was the exact same as Mrs Douglas herself. No matter what the press say about Demi, she still looks good, although she'll never be as pretty as she was in Ghost. And no amount of Botox can remove those lines around your mouth honey!
There's a lot of allusions to other movies in this - Flashdance, Sound of Music, Singin' In The Rain, and even Grease gets a mention! (Cameron Diaz's boyfriend in the movie, goes to his high school reunion at Rydell!)

The fight scenes were ridiculous. At least make them a little believable. There is no way they can do Matrix like jumps and kicks. The fact they never reload and miss is also stupid.
The plot is so lame anybody could follow it. Demi Moore plays a renegade angel who is out for payback. The only good thing about Demi was how incredible she looked to be 40+ years old.

1472625,4,B00005JLYW,"The ""Charlie's Angels"" films are much like the opera. You either love it or hate it. I personally like 'em (this film was much better than ""The Matrix Reloaded"". That movie was pure geekboy trash (yes, I got all the metaphysical monkey crap & I still hated it)).
  In ""Full Throttle"", the Angels are hired by the Justice Department to retrieve a set of titanium rings that have secured files (once hooked up and downloaded onto a computer) of all the applicants of the witness protection program. If fallen into the wrong hands, these files can be bought and sold at a mighty high price.
  The film itself, just like the original, doesn't take itself seriously (come on people, its based on a jiggly 70's T.V. show for God's sake!). The Angels do have there own personal problems, among the best of them is, Dylan worrying if the Angels might be splitting up (Dylan has a vision of the future Angels, among them, her being teamed up with the Olsen twins!). The soundtrack is great including songs from Rob Zombie, Loverboy, The Beach Boys, and Pink.
  The action is, sadly, what bogs the movie down. It's great to have a cool action sequence in a film like this, but, when the film relies way, way too much on ""Matrix"" style fighting and ""Bullit"" Time slow-motion, you can't help, but, role your eyes and feel there should be something original in its place. The action is also way too cartoonish. I'm not a big fan of motorcross but even I know a cyclist can't do a handstand, pull out a gun, fire off three shots, turn back around, and land perfectly on the ground! If there is a third film, McG should calm the action down quite a bit(how about just a plain old shoot out or bar fight w/ no slow-motion?) and have a  good solid plotline (how about something along the lines: The Angels have to catch a killer who is slowly wiping out former Angel members). Overall, the movie is worth the rent.",1080518400,11,1897,4.481159420289855
1472626,5,B00005JLYW,"""Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle"" reunites Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore as Natalie Cook, Alex Munday and Dylan Sanders for another fun romp to save the world.
THE STORY:
The Angels are called in to recover the stolen One Ring of Sauron (well, no actually), but they are called in to recover a stolen pair of power rings before they fall into the wrong hands.  Not too sure WHAT the rings were supposed to be able to do but the actual plotline of the movie was not its strong point.  In a moment of character development the girls also come to realize what true friendship is as changes in their lives threaten to break them apart.
THE COOL THINGS:
Like the first movie, the plot was simply a good excuse for the three ladies to get out into the world in their cool outfits, kick some booty girl power style and generally have fun.  Trust me, this movie was TONS of fun.
The action and undercover hijinks are WAAAY up from the first movie as it is obvious the girls are now comfortable in their roles and it is OBVIOUS they are having a blast out there.  The fight scenes and action sequences are more daring them the first movie and the pop culture parodies are even funnier than the last (including homages to MC Hammer and CSI!!!).
BEST SCENES:
1. CSI Parody Scene
2. `O Grady Wharehouse Battle
3. The Motocross Scene
4. The Final Battle

8. Trailers for Charlie's Angels I and II, Bad Boys II, Mona Lisa Smile, Something's Gotta Give, and S.W.A.T.
THE VERDICT:
Overall this was just a REAL fun film to watch.  The story was forgettable, but it wasn't really about the story.  The film was what it was, a simple fun 2 hour escape from reality featuring great action, beautiful girls in great costumes and an overall fun look at our lives through the pop culture pokes.  The DVD package outdid itself as you get TONS of great extras.  Obviously a lot of love and fun went into this film and it shows.
Final Grades:
Movie:  4 stars
Extras:  5 stars
Total:  4.5 stars

1472628,1,B00005JLYW,"""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" is one of the most boring, mind-numbing, dim-witted and utterly pointless films I've seen all year.  Being a fan of the first film, I was first in line to see it.  I left the theater thoroughly disappointed.  All the freshness, cuteness, and, shall I say, ""funness"" that made the original so likable is gone.  And what is with Demi Moore?  She had about 10 minutes screen time yet somehow managed to become the ""main attraction"".  The woman is just so horribly smug, arrogant and downright vain that it shows in her performance and therefore made her insufferable to watch.  Hey, maybe that's a good thing seeing as how she was playing the villain and all.
Cameron, Lucy, and Drew are no longer charming and adorable as they were in the first film.  In ""Full Throttle"", they come off as obnoxious, slutty, and stupid.  I actually found myself rooting against the angels! :-O  Bill Murray does not reprise his role as Bosley and is instead replaced by Bernie Mac.  In my opinion, Murray's wit and lovable personality brought some much-needed humor to the original and without him; ""Full Throttle"" really lacks any actual humor.  In addition, the script/plot is silly and predictable, the action sequences are cartoonish and stale, and the special effects are tiresome.  The only positive thing I have to say about ""Full Throttle"" is that Justin Theroux has the most amazing six-pack I have ever seen.  Or was it an eight-pack?  A ten-pack maybe?",1079308800,10,1478,4.856
1472629,1,B00005JLYW,"This movie was by far one of the worst movies I have even seen in a movie theater (second only to He Got Game and Cabin Fever).  I know, I know, this movie isn't meant to be realistic or have a riviting plot...but COME ON!
The plot was atricious, the dialog was cliched and pathetic, the acting was horrible, and it was obvious the director had made his money directing music videos.  What the hell is McG anyway?
I admit, I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, but I was still hugely disappointed.  I liked the first movie because of Bill Murray (who was inadequately replaced with Bernie Mac) and the action scenes, which I thought was very well choriographed.  The action scenes in this movie however were very (and I'm talking VERY) unrealistic, overdone, and copied from other movies.  I don't look for realism in action movies, but this was just so over the top I couldn't help it.
The other thing that made me mad about this movie was I couldn't get over the sense that the makers of the movie were targeting the male audience, and suckering them into paying to watch a terrible movie just to see scantily clad women.  There are many GOOD movies that I can watch for that and still enjoy the movie.  Bottom line, if a crappy movie has pretty girls in it, it's still a crappy movie.
Do not waste your time with this movie.  If you just want to see the girls, see the first one.  If you want to actually see a good action movie, there are tons out there that are a lot better than this.",1079049600,5,1504,4.3428571428571425

1472732,1,B00005JLYW,"Sweet Pete, what a monstrous turd.  Worse, a betrayal.
To preface my comments, I absolutely loved the first one.  Loved it.  And I'm a guy who roots for a movie to be good; I'm no critic or ""film buff"".  I am a fan of movies and you gotta' really pooch-it big time for me to give it a thumbs down.  Man, this thing stinks on its own terms.  Within the context of the world the first movie created so wonderfully, this movie is a betrayal of everything that made you want to see another Charlie's Angels flick.  Where to begin?  First, the action scenes are boring.  When they're silly it's an improvement.  The special effects are, simply, BAD.  There is no suspension of belief whatsoever and the majority of the fight work is OBVIOUSLY computer generated.  PU.  Second, what the hell did they do to the girls?  The way their makeup and lighting was done makes them look... spoiled somehow, over exposed.  Either way, it's disturbing.  I'm not the dude who's checking out the wardrobe, but you can't get around it.  They look like the goal was to make them look overcooked or something.  It's so profound and in your face that it's actually distracting, even to someone who would normally care less.  Third, the things about the movie that made you like the characters are GONE.  They're bimbo-fied in the worst way imaginable.  The fact that there are large portions of this movie where you have no idea what's happening won't bother you much because you will not care.  I went from a full plate of positive thoughts about these characters to hoping the movie would end ASAP.  Fourth, oh man, what the hell did they do to Bernie Mack?  You will forever respect Bill Murray for managing to limit his association with this lump of crap to appearing in a photograph for about 5 seconds.  Poor Bernie - who is very funny - is turned into some kind of nimrod.  Fifth, a ten year old could watch and enjoy the first film, and so could an adult.  This movie has content that is not cool for kids.  It adds nothing and ruins the film for younger viewers.  Not a huge deal, but one more example of the back stab this steamy dog pile represents.
I could go on and on. I guess my point is this; it's not just bad, it seems to have been designed to sabotage the warm feelings and enjoyment anyone ever got out of the first movie.  I suppose this is actual mild anger, and I am venting.  I'm sort of sorry, but not anything like a grief you'll feel if you see this heap.",1078099200,9,2459,4.385809312638581

Once we saw the first and said ""only fair and the effects are far too stupid to be believable,"" perhaps now we're past that and can just enjoy this one on its own level.

1472736,3,B00005JLYW,"Fans of the modern theatrical incarnation of the hit 70s T&A-a-rama shouldn't be too disappointed with the second cinematic outing staring three of the hottest ladies in film today. It's a thrill ride of bombastic, baroque proportions where every action sequence blows off the screen like a James Bond flick on steroids. There's something to be said of the steam-generating hotness of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Lui, but all the butt-kickin' action, cleverly orchestrated comedic scripting and eye-popping, scantily-clad flesh isn't enough to make it memorable. After the ride, it's quickly forgotten. Still, it's one of those movies one likes in the collection to pull out once a year for surely escapist purposes.
If you're looking for mindless fun with a generous payoff in humorous and sexy antics pureed with flashy unrealistic action sequences, fun cameos and over-the-top acting that doesn't take itself too seriously, give the dvd a whirl. Don't bother searching high & low or paying extra for the ""Unrated"" version; the changes are barely noticeable. Further, while the slick, shadowy and suggestive cover art entices the prurient mind and the wandering eye, there is no extra skin in this flick, just a few drawn out action scenes and a little blood.",1077494400,,1271,5.174757281553398

1472739,3,B00005JLYW,"This movie is a few stories all woven into a bigger story.  Not only do we learn some history about the different characters, heroes and villains, but we also learn the history of the agency.  Unfortunately, this prevents the film as a whole from resonating with the audience.
Although the larger story concerns a stolen list of people being hidden in witness protection, the larger theme is one of identity.  Who are the killers?  Who needs protection?  Yes, the list is one element of unknown identity, but the audience will take a tour through each of the angels' history.  No one is quite sure she really knows who the other angel is.  Each has so many stories to protect herself and her work that the confusion creates the comedy or drama.
Lucy Liu's character has not told her father what she does for a living.  As a subplot, we see the humor that comes from trying to keep up a cover story then creating more confusion when both think the other understands, yet neither does.
Drew Barrymore's character provides us with the drama as during her journey she speaks with a past angel, Jaclyn Smith, who has a cameo role.
Demi Moore was an angel, but isn't any more.  Her quest for identity is to find who the best angel is.
None of these give away the story or the main plot; however, these tips help you to see how the different subplots underline the main plot.  I am not sure I would recommend the movie.  The film can't seem to decide whether it is comedy or action, and as a result, the movie undercuts its power.  There is nothing wrong with comedy in action and action in comedy, but going overboard with either distracts the audience from the finer points.",1076630400,,1669,4.5083056478405314
1472740,4,B00005JLYW,"It happened with 'The Avengers', to an extent it happened with 'Batman Returns', and now it's happening with 'Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle'. Critics and audiences alike lambasting a perfectly entertaining movie becuase of it's OTT-ness and refusal to adhere to the principles lain down in the original media.
Except what audiences and critics seem unable to remember is that for a modern remake of a classic comic/pulp TV show you can't just adhere to the situations and plotlines of the original becuase they would look silly and outdated. What the above mentioned movies have done, to one degree of success or another, is take a well-loved premise and updated it witha hefty dose of fun and irony, and thankfully, 'Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle' is one of the more successful ventures.
Reprising their roles as Dylan, Alex and Natalie, Drew barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz look like they're having the on-screen time of their lives, as they follow a perfunctory plot about FBI Information and an ngel-turned-Bad, Madison Lee (Demi Moore in a fne return to top form). Helped by an all-new Bosley (Bernie Mac in an entertaining, if hugely predictable turn) and some wildly unbelievable stunt-work, the Angels punch, kick and simper their way across all 107 minutes of this picture.
The chemistry between the three leads is as unmistakable as it is central to the success of the movie. Moore as Lee is suitably devilish as the sexually ambiguous powermonger, and other supporting cast nods go to Mac, Crispin glover as the ridiculously OTT Thin Man and a wonderful cameo from the still-gorgeous jaclyn Smith as Kelley Garrett (from the original TV run, but we can't help but wonder how fabulous she would have been in Moore's role).
Directorially this movie doesn't do anything big or clever - as with all matrix-effects-clones, the action comes thick and fast - but it's enjoyable, just the same. McG does a very good job at keeping us sucked in and laughing.
All in all, this is a total no-brainer of an action flick. It doesn't ask you to think, rather sits you down and does all the work by itself. It's a shallow, glamorous and totally fun roll in the hay with three fabulous femmes fatale. Fans of story-driven action may want to go elsewhere, but leave your brain at reception and you'll love it just as much as the original movie.

1472815,3,B00005JLYW,"A film by McG
I started watching this movie with the expectation that I would absolutely hate it.  I had enjoyed the first ""Charlie's Angels"" movie, but the overwhelming number of negative reviews for ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" dropped my expectations to zero.  I didn't hate the movie, but I can't say that I really liked it either.  The content of the movie was about what you would expect.
The three angels, Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are back and are still working for Charlie.  This time they are involved on a case that involves the FBI's list of everyone in the Witness Protection Program.  There are two rings, that when brought together, contain the codes to reveal the entire list.  This is very dangerous information to let fall into the wrong hands.  Naturally, it does.  The angels are trying to reclaim the rings and stop the bad guy.  They are given their missions from Charlie, relayed through Bosley (Bernie Mac).  You might remember that Bill Murray was Bosley in the first movie.  This Bosley is the step brother of Bill Murray's character.
When the first movie came out, it was silly, but it was also fresh.  ""Charlie's Angels"" did not take itself seriously, and it was a lot of fun to watch.  The fight/action scenes in the first gave us ""Matrix"" like effects, but it was done well enough, and appropriately enough, that it worked in the context of the movie.  This time around the Matrix-effect is used far too often, sometimes at inappropriate times, and it is used in such a way that the angels would give Neo and Trinity a run for their money.  We accept that the angels can do things that they shouldn't be able to physically do...but ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" stretches credulity a bit too thin.
There are some things that work in this movie.  The relationship between the three angels is a major selling point for the movie.  It seems like they are honestly friends, and it plays very well.  The character of Madison Lee (Demi Moore) is another strong point for the movie.  Madison is a former angel, one who left Charlie's employ but still bears a grudge.  Madison was the most interesting character in the movie, despite her lack of screen time.  The other interesting character was the returning Thin Man (Crispin Glover), but he wasn't really given anything to do.  Just when it looked like his character might develop, he was off the screen again.
The bottom line is that this is a fast-paced, silly action movie.  I didn't think it was very good, but at least I wasn't checking the clock every 5 minutes.  That's really the best I can say for it.  It was dumb, but it wasn't boring.  ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" will never be confused with a good movie, but it isn't the worst movie of the year, either.",1074729600,,2798,4.670756646216769
1472816,1,B00005JLYW,"Not nearly as entertaining as its predecessor, Full Throttle relies heavily upon admittedly dazzling CG special effects to compensate for the fact that the plot is thoroughly underdeveloped.  Demi Moore's return to the big screen is largely wasted, as her character seems more interested in showing skin than making any meaningful contribution to the plot.  And no, boys and girls, that's not why this is an ""unrated"" version.  Frankly, I'm even not sure what footage makes the Unrated version ""unrated.""  Perhaps there were a few scenes that had to be cut or shortened to retain the PG-13 rating, but the ""unrated"" label amounts to a mere marketing ploy since ""unrated"" DVDs are all the rage these days.
Another grossly underutilized character in the film is Crispin Glover's ""Thin Man,"" who is the only character who is remotely interesting beyond the eye candy level.  Finally, Bernie Mac as Bosley lacks any of the qualities that Bill Murray brought to the first film, which was at least more tolerable than this piece of cinematic refuse.
I understand that this film was intended to be a ""popcorn movie,"" but even popcorn movies can only ask the viewer to suspend their disbelief so far.  Full Throttle clearly crosses this line in the first five minutes of the film, and then proceeds to new heights of absurdity.  Sure, a certain amount of ""camp"" was inherent in the adaptation from 1970s TV, but McG sends the viewer directly to Camp Ludicrous.
""McG"" should go back to making McMusic videos for Smashmouth and Sugar Ray.  Unlike music videos, in a feature film one cannot substitute style for substance and call it anything but what it is: a B-movie marketed as a blockbuster.",1073952000,2,1684,4.88421052631579

From the very beginning of the movie, I knew that ""suspension of disbelief"" would not get me through the film.  So, I turned-off the analytical portion of my brain-pan, and rolled with it.  I found myself laughing, out loud, while watching ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.""
Everything about this movie cracks me up--from the girl's goofy behavior, Spoofy Slapstick Comedy, and hilarious Over-The-Top Deductions that would make Sherlock Holmes raise and eyebrow... to the fact that ""The Boss"" has no clue what he is supposed to do and the Villain plays such a Straight-faced counterpart to the movie's general Free-for-all Goofiness.
Also, this DVD comes with a video (and guest performance) by one of my favorite Singers:  ""Pink.""

The stunts, for example, I love a good action, but I really am frustrated when all the hyped stunts are overly edited and processed with all the pretentious slow-motion tricks and multi-angle camera movements. It actually ruins any potential viewing enjoyment. The more slow motion and rapid cuts there are, the less impressed I am.
The music is also a lead character in this movie, because obviously the dialog is of no importance, otherwise they wouldn't drown out all the good jokes with the plodding music.
Let's see though, there were a few good moments: Bernie Mac, John Cleese and Crispin Glover are in it. Crispin is such a cool and creepy 'baddy'. Demi, well, Demi is her usual gorgeous liposucked enhanced self. Oh and Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu are in it too.
I suppose the best scene would be the fight at the cargo warehouse at the harbour between Seamus and his gang versus the Angels. Not that the scene really needed it, but the Prodigy song lands an additional punch to the already fiesty, dirty, brutal hand-to-hand brawl. Nice and gritty.
As for the DVD: No deleted scenes even though some do appear briefly in the outtakes or the Making Of documentaries. The Full Throttle Jukebox is silly, especially since the director and his music supervisor's comments are, like, you know, totally, cool, like, ya know.

Apart from this gripe, which I could put aside as Demi Moore is only one women, but the plot is unsalvageable and only falls further downhill as the movie progesses. This movie may have made money, but not sense. At least in the first movie suspending disbelief was possible (and Sam Rockwell, a great actor, made an amazing villain, unlike Ms Moore and Justin Theroux- he was just too much), but in this one forget it.
On a better note there are some good moments in the film notably when it's doing the comedy thing... maybe thats something to look out for if your forced to watch this movie!

This movie doesn't portray any sense of reality to absolute impossible stunts that could never happen. But it wasn't just the over the top stunts that stunk up this film. A combination of sudden magic when the girls would be in one place then all of a sudden somewhere else, then poof, they disappeared to another location.

1472885,4,B00005JLYW,"Movie:  Okay, did anyone expect great cinematic art here? No, and why should they. The first Charlie's Angels was one of the dumbest no-brainer movies ever made, and Full Throttle keeps that tradition alive. While I did enjoy Charlie's Angels more than Full Throttle, I have to admit I did have a damn fun time watching it.  After all, everyone needs a good dumb film like this every once in a while. I won't even begin to get into the plot, as there isn't much of one, anyway. As Natalie, Dylan, and Alex, the three Angels, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are obviously having the time of their lives. Despite looking very hot, they bring a fun energy to the movie that you just have to love. Demi Moore, in one of the best comebacks of the new millennium, is not only hotter than ever, but is also having a blast as an ex-angel gone bad.  All in all, one of the dumbest movies ever, but it's so much fun, who really cares?  (4/5)
Picture: Full Throttle comes to DVD in an ""Unrated"" 2.40:1 anamorphic widescren version, and the theatrical version is presented in full frame 1.33:1. Seeing as the film was shot open matte, the full screen version contains more visual information on the top and bottom of the screen, while being very slightly cropped on the sides. The widescreen version loses some information on the top and bottom, but opens up a bit on the sides. Both look pretty good. Colors are very strong, and clarity is good. However, the picture can look a little too sharp at times.  Not a bad transfer, though.  (4/5)
Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is excellent.  The surrounds are active most of the time, and are put to effective use.  A highlight is the motorcycle racing scene.  While not as good as the excellent DTS track on the Superbit Charlie's Angels DVD, this does serve the film well.  (5/5)
Extras: There is a commentary by director McG, a study on the cars in Full Throttle, interviews, trailers, and the P!NK music video ""Feel Good Time."" There are quite a few nice extras here that are fun and informative.  (4/5)
Overall:  A pretty good movie gets a pretty good DVD. Recommended.  (4/5)",1072828800,,2130,4.544502617801047

All three lead actresses were charming and had great chemistry together, the action scenes were surprisingly exciting and it didn't take itself too seriously. It was just fun. The sequel, ""Full Throttle"", however, is a letdown. Although Cameron, Drew and Lucy are still sexy and adorable, the script is awful. It's just an incoherent mess. Almost all of the jokes fall flat, and this time the action sequences are poorly conceived and executed. The only thing I really found interesting about the film was the casting of Demi Moore as ""fallen angel"" Madison Lee. Moore is diabolically sexy in the role, so it's too bad the script doesn't give her enough to do. With four of the most exciting actresses in Hollywood in one film, it's really a shame the writers and director couldn't make this film work.",1072310400,,845,4.834482758620689
1473014,2,B00005JLYW,This film was one of the stinkers of 2003. Not a cereberal film at all but I wasn't expecting it to be. The leading ladies were of course the main attraction. Cameron Diaz is great for eye candy in this film. The Sweetest Thing wasn't exactly Cocteau but I enjoyed it even though it wasn't that good. It would've been hilarious if Sean Young was the villianess instead of Demi Moore. The plot didn't exist and Bernie Mac was annoying.,1072051200,,434,4.4375
1473015,1,B00005JLYW,"The movie is 106 minutes long.  I feel asleep, so I don't know how this ends.  The last scene I remember is people jumping off a roof, then back on the roof, then falling to their death, then coming back to life, then villain turns good guy, then dies again.
Confused?  I know I am.  The wire work exceeded what was done in the Matrix.  While the Matrix was a fantasy world, the angels take themselves far too seriously to have their acrobatics believable.  In one of the opening scenes, they were all plunging to their deaths in a stalled helicopter.  Had the helicopter impacted with terrain, the movie could have made a good short film.  I forget how they survive, or why the aircraft took so long to drop, but none of this is really important.
It was far less cute than the original - no quick thinking and sharp wit, just lots of flips, blood and explosions with no plot.  While Bill Murray brought the classical comical side to Bosley in the first movie, Bernie Mac's style is awkward and out of place.  People are murdered, stabbed, shot, and drop dead all over the place, which should question the movie's PG-13 rating.  The Thin Man pops in to make a cameo, for no apparent reason, changes side, falls off a roof, comes back, then is horribly murdered - this is where I was so confused that turned the movie off in favor of whatever was on television.
Oh, am I giving away the plot?  Not to worry.  There is no plot.  Bruce Willis makes an extremely short appearance, then had his name removed from the credits when he saw how bad the movie was.  Yes, this movie makes the Die Hard series look good.  Jaclyn Smith also makes an appearance and provides several minutes of coherent plot line amid the blood, gore, explosions, and comic strip style special effects - making me wish she had appeared much earlier in the film.

The plot is very weak and it does seem as if the writers threw together a bunch of fight scenes, revealing outfits, and special effects. Drew, Cameron and Lucy are still a great team and their chemistry together shines on screen. Bernie Mac as Bosley was the worst choice ever. I like Bernie but he was not suited for this role. Bosley is always a bit bumbling but smart and he always finds a way to come through for the girls. In this film Bosley is a moron. They tried to make him funny but it's just bad. It even seems as though Cameron, Drew and Lucy have a hard time pretending to laugh at his jokes. Demi plays an ex- Angel bent on revenge. Her character isn't developed but we learn she always had a problem with teamwork. The best part of the movie is when Cameron and Demi are fighting and Cameron tells her she has one important thing Demi will never have. Friends! Then Drew and Lucy fly in and help her.

1473022,2,B00005JLYW,"McG got his start making music videos and that's clearly evident in this movie which only has about thirty seconds of screen time with no songs playing in the background. Not only that, but the movie really isn't a movie at all, but is more like a bunch of comical music videos lightly stiched together through a semi-decent plot. Besides the babes, the only thing good about the movie is the plot. Unfortunately, due to poor acting, editing, writing, and directing the plot is buried beneath landfill of pop-cultural mediocrity.

The movie goes something like this. There is a list that contains all the files for people in the witness protection program on two separate titanium rings. These rings are worn by two separate individuals who have very little communication with each other. Some one is out to get the rings and make a profit and the Angels are called in to find out who and stop them.

Bill Murray passed as Bosley on this one (Bernie Mac fills in as his adopted brother) and it's easy to see why. It's difficult to believe that this movie actually passes as entertainment. I mean, I thought the first movie was bad, but this film makes the first CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie look like a cinematic masterpiece. It's so sad, too. The series was much more intelligent and entertaining than either of the movies have been. Not only that, this film had a decent plot and could have made a decent movie. Alas, it wasn't too be. Instead, all we get is a film full of pretentious people who think they are funny and worth watching.

It seems like the unrated title was slapped onto the cover just so more copies would sell. Anyway, on with the review: As I said in my title, Full Throttle definately lives up to it's predecessor. The returning characters in Full Throttle are Bosley who this time is played by Bernie Mac, which I prefered him as Bosley over Bill Murray and the Thin Man played again by Crispin Glover from the first movie. Demi Moore does a good job playing the sexy villain. The new disguieses and the motorcyle race are also a plus. I can't believe the number of people who gave negative reviews towards this movie! In my opinion, Full Throttle is one of many examples on how sequels aren't always a bad idea. As for specail features on the DVD, the unrated and theatrical version aren't much different.",1069545600,,958,4.505747126436781
1473229,2,B00005JLYW,"Before I start, I should admit that I haven't seen the first CA film and the only reason why I saw Full Throttle in the first place was because Justin Theroux (Seamus -not 'Shamus' people- O'Grady) is in it. Same reason applies to why I bought the DVD.
That said, CA:FT is the most ridiculous and over-the-top film. I don't even know why people are explaining the 'plot' when there is NO PLOT. It seemed like it was simply an excuse for Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu to get together. I swear, none of them even tried to act (which is a great disappointment for me, since Diaz and Barrymore can be good actresses when they want to be. ie Riding in Cars With Boys; Being John Malkovich). Ditto for Luke Wilson and Demi Moore. The only saving graces in this film were John Cleese and Justin Theroux...and even then I cringed a couple of times at the brogue. But I can forgive an imperfect Irish accent, given that it is one of the most difficult accents to master....and, you know, how bloody hot he is (Good Lord did he ever get ripped! See his eppie on Sex and The City and you'll really appreciate how much he had to work out to get those abs). Yeah, I can be shamelessly shallow. Still not shallow enough to love this film simply for the sexiness that is JT.

However, this movie suffers from the same banal writing as the first.  Most of the movie consists of cue-card dialogue and cookie cutter action sequences.  There are a few gems in the rough, including a scene where Drew Barrymore runs into machismo in Mexico, and a really funny rendition of MC Hammer dancing.  The unfolding helicopter is impressive.  If you're looking for a light fluffy movie for a date, where you don't have to pay close attention to get the drift of what's going on, this is it.",1069372800,2,639,4.660714285714286
1473231,5,B00005JLYW,"The Charlie's Angels series of movies improves greatly with this second one.  The action has been powered up, the story is more interesting, and the humor works a little better.  In other words, the whole thing has been put on overdrive.  One of the big changes is that Bill Murray has been replaced with Bernie Mac as Bosley.  I love Bill Murray's comedy, but he didn't fit in well with the first Angels movie, so I think this is an improvement.  Another thing is the use of wire action and CG has increased to good effect.  Also, Tom Green is absent from this movie (thank goodness).
The Angels are played by Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu.  I particularly enjoyed Cameron Diaz's performance.  Her portrayal of Natalie added a lot of energy and freshness to the movie.  Without her performance, I would probably drop the rating.  I just can't say it enough--Cameron is a great actress.
The basic plot of this sexy comic action movie is that two rings have been stolen from the government.  When the two rings are combined, they release the identity and location of everyone on the witness protection program.  The Angels must stop the shadowy figure who is threatening to sell these rings to the highest bidder.
One of the scenes that was a stand-out for me was the one at a motorcross rally.  Several dirt bike racers jump and flip and shoot and generally cause a lot of destruction while the Angels try to catch a surfer assasin.  It's really thrilling to watch.",1069113600,,1478,4.634615384615385

1473234,4,B00005JLYW,"McG (Hot Wheels, Fast Lane) directed this sequel to his first film which was well received but the critics and the public. This film has the same flashing cuts, shots and fast action that it is really eye candy for the audiences.
The other thing this movie has going for it is the ability to make the absurd fun and believable in the story of the movie. It is funny and sharp and it looks like all three angels are having great fun doing this movie.
Cameron Diaz (Shred 1 & 2, Vanilla Sky) , Drew Barrymore (E.T., Everafter, Batman Forever) and Lucy Liu (Chicago, Kill Bill, Alley McBeal) are fantastic, funny, witty, sharp and energetic. They bring color and amazing electricity to the screen. Drew and Cameron look like they have known each other for years. And Drew really shines in this film with an emotional side that saves the lives of her co-workers.
Now this movie has agreat villan and played by a talented and fine looking actress named Demi Moore (GI Jane, Hunchbakc of Notre Dame) Demi is funny and amazingly evil. (Not to mention she looks good in a bikini on the beach! Her ex - Bruce Willis (Die Hard 1, 2 & 3) even makes an appearance..although short.
Crispen Glover (Back To the Future, Willard)  is cleverly back as well as Mat Lablanc (Lost In Space, Friends) from the first film. They are hysterical. John Cleese (Die Another Day, Harry Potter 1, 2 & 3) and Robert Patrick (Terminator 2, X-Files) are new comers who add to the story and are quite funny.
The worst part of the movie was Bernie Mac (Life, Oceans Eleven). Why was he cast as Bosley? Why him? Gross! I know there was a problem with the studio or stars about Bill Murry - But he was a much better Bosley. Just ignore him......and the movie is really good.

What you have to put up with is, quite possibly, the most poorly written script that any major Hollywood release has ever had.  Bad movies are one thing and some are even fun in their badness.  This movie skirts around fun and just settles into uncomfortable.
Scenes run together with no connecting elements whatsoever beyond the foolish whims of so-called director McG and whatever chimp wrote the film.  The performances from the actors are as unbelievable as the foolish and poorly choreographed stunts they spend the entire film throwing at us.
The Matrix offered moviegoers an asounding array of stunts.  Charlie's Angels, attempting to captilize on that, offers a wide array of ludicrous, unbelievable, unimpressive and cartoonish stunts.  And let's not forget numerous useless celebrity cameos.  And why is Demi Moore in this movie?  Who knows.

1473237,4,B00005JLYW,"Bigger, louder, more preposterous than the first movie, yet it slips in and out of your head about as easily.  In this episode (movie, I meant movie!!) the angels must recover two rings upon which are encoded the names of thousands of innocent people currently in the Witness Protection Program. Should both rings fall into the wriong hands (the same hands - the code requires both rings) the lives of innocents will fall to the whims of the evil crime lords who put then away.  One of these dark figures is an Irish enforcer with a link to the past of one of the angels.  But an even darker force is at work pulling the strings...
...which is as good an excuse as any to craft a film that alternates between stylized action sequences (with the angels fighting in mid-air, flying off buildings, speeding cars or helicopters) with countless visual gags (the Olsen twins as future Angels; the Angels as nuns; Cameron Diaz as a teenager, complete with nightbrace!; Bernie Mac as the new Bosley)  and TV in-jokes (Starsky and Hutch's car; Mr. Rourke's car from ""Fantasy Island""; the steel-welders from ""Flashdance"") and Hollywood cameos (Bruce Willis looking older than he can; Carrie Fisher as Mother Superior; Bela Karolyi as Lucy Liu's coach).  This is the sort of nonsensical Hollywood action epic that we thought only existed as jokes on sitcoms.  It's a lot of preposterous fun, not dampened for those who caught the first movie.  If the flick is less-then-perfect, we can blame Demi Moore as a former Angel now working for herself, a performance that is conspicuously bloodless in an otherwise pumping flick.  Crispin Glover is back (which kind of makes you wonder what exactly happened at the end of the last movie) but not as much psychotic fun as in the first movie.  The flick has John Cleese as Lucy Liu's father who somehow gets the idea that his daughter is some kind of high-priced call-girl (a running joke that gets tired fast) while Shia LeBouf (""Holes"") rounds out the cast as a member of witness protection who gets taken in by the angels, but is otherwise wasted.  Though little more than an extended music video, ""Angels"" has a message for those who must have one: the Angels never use guns!  If you've got your friends (and some Kevlar), you're more powerful than a horde of gun wielding psychotics.

1473338,2,B00005JLYW,"Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle
It should have worked.  It had all the elements of success:  a hot cast, nostalgic appeal, a retro `80s soundtrack, and plenty of action (the self-parodying, deliberately over-the-top kind). But somehow, Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle missed its mark by a mile.
The sequel to the original Charlie's Angels movie has the sexy trio trying to recover two stolen rings that hold the secrets of HALO, a witness protection type program.  Naturally, the bad guys are after the rings as well, which are being held hostage for the highest bidder by a mysterious third party.  Along the way, the Angels get into plenty of covert ops that require high-tech stakeouts, lowbrow cheesecake, thrilling chase scenes and spoofy kick-bum, incredible (literally, not to be believed) fight sequences.  To complicate matters, the girls are each dealing with domestic and romantic entanglements in their private lives and personal demons.  In the end, a big moral lesson is learned by all.
Now I realize that this type of movie is not to be taken seriously; it was after all written to be a comedy.  Even a comedy, however, needs a little more substance than the thin plot of CA:  FT.  It could be forgiven its other mistakes if only it managed to be funny on some level, but instead, we're left with that vague feeling that our intelligence was just insulted.  Even a cast with greats like John Cleese, Lucy Liu and Bernie Mac couldn't salvage the bad script, lack of plot and downright unfunny sitcom-style jokes.  Need examples?  Here:
John Cleese plays Liu's dad visiting from out of town, who runs into her boyfriend unexpectedly.  In true predictable tv style, the boyfriend lets slip her ""secret"" profession in just such a way that dad misinterprets and thinks she's a call girl.  From then on we are haunted by the painfully unfunny running joke as Liu and boyfriend innocently deliver one double entendre after another to poor suffering dad who's trying to be a good sport about it all.  Oh, the hilarity that almost ensued!
Bernie Mac is the new Bosley.  This normally brilliant comedian is reduced to a hammy, self-conscious buffoon that seems to have no real pupose in the organization except perhaps to underscore how smart the Angels are. Bosley fumbles around incompetently while the girls are out getting the job done, ha ha.  None of Mac's wit or wordplay is showcased here.  Why oh why was this done to Bernie?!?
To top it off, the ""chemistry"" between the Angels is forced and syrupy.  None of them manage to pull off convincing emotional interactions, but ironically this appears to be the one serious concept the writers were trying to convey.  .  After I heard the ""we're a family"" line for the umpteenth time I just wanted to throw the Dvd case at the tv screen.
If it weren't for the fact that Kill Bill was released months after, I would have accused CA:  FT of trying to tap into this newly-created ultraviolence/comedy genre (but of course failing).  Thanks Columbia Tristar for wasting yet another two hours of my life that I won't get back!

The 'angels' are all on top-form and are pretty well fitting in their roles. But Demi Moore's fallen angel Madison Lee is one of the best villains I've seen in a while, she's creepy in her wickedness! Moore may be 40, but she can still seer up the screen even if only in unnecessary beach bathing scenes with a Lamborghini.
What really shines amidst the high-octane action though is the fantastic soundtrack. Loads of cool numbers that lend the film its breakneck upbeat pace.
The plot is certainly the glaring weakness, a bare skeleton for the film to stick to. The story of a list of people using the Witness Protection Programme certainly isn't what 'Charlie's Angels' will be remembered for. Action sequences and CG are expected to be perfect in today's high-tech world, thus, all visual points are well choreographed and conceived.
All in all, 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' is good guilty fun. It's not Godfather or Se7en, but it isn't as brainless and inept as some of the reviews will have you believe.

Lucy Lui, Cameron Diaz, and Drew Barrymore play Charlie's angels, superhero crime fighters employed by mysterious never-seen Charlie.  Bosely (who was played by Bill Murray) is now played by Bernie Mac, who is always funny.  Demi Moore (who is seriously fit for a woman 40 years old) plays Madison, an angel-gone-bad.  It is a typical case of good vs. evil.  The plot is wish-washed and a mess.  The characters are not developed well, mainly because the first one developed them.  There is little drama, mainly only a seriously lame nostalgia between Dillon (Barrymore) and Shamus the big bad guy, who Dillon locked up.  That should have seriously been left out of the movie.  The most dissapointing aspect of the film is the sub-par action sequences.  I'm an action man, and this movie has action sequences that are still cool, but really sub-par compared to the first flick.
The film is always fun to watch, like the first.  Some serious skin is shown, but nothing completly.  Although some may disagree, I think the film DOES warrent only a PG-13 and it is not a stretch.

1473443,1,B00005JLYW,"I can't remember the last time I felt so uncomfortable and uneasy in a film than while watching Charlie's Angels Full Throttle, and it has been a very long time since I felt so happy to see the credits roll!
Far from meeting my expectations, this second adventure of the Angels was a very badly written and directed film (by original director Mc G), and this is why,
First of all, the action is the backbone of these films,often lightened up with humour and some sexiness. The decision of director Mc G to show every fall and jump in slow motion was very annoying and ruined the whole action sequences. They did appear very 'digital' without being impressive or exciting.
The humour was supposed mainly to come courtesy of the great John Cleese, but yet again Mc G fails miserably to invest funnily in such a comic talent, and Cleese does look uncomfortable.
Bosely's character played by Bernie Mac appeared too dim witted for no apparent reason.
Moreover, I cringed at the many references to other films, supposedly to add a cheeky humour: Cape Fear (the prisoner with tattoos bent on revenge),Terminator (the naked kneeling posture of Arnie), and the Matrix.
Had this been a parody like Scary Movie or Naked Gun, then these references would be expected and funny, but it is not and I found them out of place.
In addition, the directing style is very pretentiously mediocre instead of the 'hip' and 'cool' it is supposed to be. It is fine if the viewers have the attention span of a goldfish, but regardless of their age group or tastes, they have not.(It is time some directors and studios treat their audiences with greater respect.)
Another point is the long list of cameos appearing in Full Throttle: Bruce Willis, Carrie Fisher, Eric Bogosian, Jacklyn Smith, Olson Twins, Pink, and Robert Foster. My only explanation for this is simply this film looked much more promising on paper and an expected huge hit due to the success of the original.
The only redeeming factor in this movie is Demi Moore who makes a fresh comeback playing a sort of 'fallen' angel. She is still gorgeous and very sexy!

1473444,2,B00005JLYW,"I'm not sure why Roger Ebert hated the first one, yet he was softer on this one eventhough he didn't recommend it. The first wasn't great don't get me wrong but it was still superior. The Matrix wannabe action was cool even if it didn't make sense that they can dodge bullets when they actually aren't inside the Matrix. In this one though it's even more silly though. I mean dodging bullets when you're jumping in the air on a motorcycle ?  It's funny finding a movie entertaining but lame at the same time. That's a weird combo lol. I guess when you have Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Luci Luu and Demi Moore in one movie, it's just hard to hate it, well when you're a guy anyway lol. They all are having fun and they at least make the movie watchable.
  I must say I hated the whole Cape Fear spoof thing though with Drew's ex con/ex b/f getting out of prison to get revenge on her. It just didn't work and was like is this an action movie or a spoof ?  Bernie Mac as Billy Murrie's brother who has the same name as him doesn't work either.

1473446,3,B00005JLYW,"I enjoyed the first Charlie's Angels movie.  It had some good laughs and the fight sequences were so well done, it didn't matter that the plot was non-existant.  Unfortunately, everything that worked in the first movie is hardly used in ""Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle""
  The biggest problem is Demi Moore... or rather, THE COMPLETE LACK OF DEMI MOORE!!  After months of advertising this movie as Demi's big comeback and hyping how Demi would play an Angel gone bad, Demi only appears for about 7 minutes of screen time.  Despite that it was told in advance that Demi was the villain, the movie is played as a whodunit, where Demi doesn't even appear until towards the end (except for a brief cameo on the beach).  Even worse, her character is poorly written, and the interesting idea of an ""Evil Angel"" is completely misused.  The only saving grace is Demi Moore herself, who is such a great actress, her performance alone makes you care about her and distracts you from how awful her dialogue is.
  Another baffling decision is the lack of martial arts sequences.  While the first movie was packed with great Angel fighting, this movie only has two fight scenes.  One in a warehouse that is shot rather poorly and nowhere near as good as what we saw in the first movie.  The second one is at the end, and ends way too quickly.  Instead of fight sequences, this time the director went with vehicle chases instead, which are not well-filmed or exciting at all.  (A certain dirtbike sequence especially seems to drag on forever.)
  Also, the movie is stuffed with lame subplots.  If you think it's not at all funny when Alex's (Lucy Lui) father (John Cleese) thinks his daughter is working as a prostitute, just wait for the almost sickening moment when the father APPROVES of his daughter being a prostitute... ""as long as it makes her happy"".  Natalie (Cameron Diaz) doesn't fare much better, with a drawn-out subplot involving her boyfriend that fizzles to a unsatisfying ending.  Instead of going off in these directions, the movie should have used this time to delve more into Madison Lee's (Demi Moore) character.  And don't get me started on Bernie Mac, who's talent is wasted as much in this movie as Bill Murray's was in the first one.  Speaking of underused characters, why is The Thin Man (Crispin Glover) even in this movie???  The Thin Man has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot, and after being a villain in ""Charlie's Angels"", now he's suddenly a good guy.  It feels as if the Thin Man was only thrown in for the audience to go, ""Cool, that's the guy from the first movie""!  Only Dylan (Drew Barrymore) is spared, as her subplot involving an abusive ex-boyfriend is effective enough to give her more depth
  Still, the movie isn't a total waste.  The acting is actually very good.  Demi Moore wasn't given much screen time but made the most of what she had to work with.  Also, all three angels were well-played, especially Drew Barrymore, who I truly think is one of the most under-rated actresses in Hollywood.  Drew makes you feel for her character.  Justin Theroux also comes through with a truly frighting performance as Drew's violent ex.  And for every 10 jokes that don't work, there is one that actually does.

1473451,3,B00005JLYW,"The first ""Charlie's Angels"" movies was a lot of fun and rather endearing in a kitschy sort of way, which was rather surprising.  But you know the ways of Hollywood.  Instead of building on that strong beginning director and McG have opted for providing more of the same and end up serving up less than before.  If you saw the first film and enjoyed it, then it is hard not to be disappointed in this 2003 sequel.  You will probably want to go rewatch the original after seeing this one to remember why you liked the first one in the first place.
All three of the Angels are back for this go around, but the rest of the cast of characters is a curious hodgepodge.  ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" brings back Luke Wilson as Pete only so Drew Barrymore's Dylan Sanders can fret that Cameron Diaz's Natalie Cook is going to leave the group (which does provide the biggest laugh in the film when Dylan pictures herself as the last of the trio to remain).  I was surprised to see that Matt LeBlanc had returned as Jason since I thought Lucy Liu's Alex Munday had disposed of him, but he does have some fun scene with John Cleese, a welcome addition as Alex's father.  But Bernie Mac as the new Bosley is a complete waste of talent (you can just imagine a cutting room floor filled with stuff that was too raunchy for the finished film), and Crispin Glover's Thin Man, who was so memorable in the first film, is back for no other reason apparently than he was so memorable in the first film.  But his stylish sense of menace is now turned into a screeching joke.
Then there is Demi Moore as Madison Lee, former angel.  The idea of her being the villain is pretty good, although the betrayal element was part of the first film as well.  But besides proving she looks better in a bikini than the three stars of the film, Moore is just not given anything great to do in this film.  There is an overwhelming sense of ""waste"" that permeates ""Full Throttle.""  The scene with the Angels dressed up as nuns to talk to Carrie Fischer is not only not as funny as the frauline scene in the first film, it is not as funny as the same scene in ""The Blues Brothers.""  I would think that this might kill the franchise, but Barrymore is one of the producers and Diaz and Liu are clearly all having fun doing this so it will probably endure for at least one more film.  But these films are heading downward, which is both the wrong direction for Angels and Hollywood franchises.",1067212800,,2458,4.373626373626373
1473452,2,B00005JLYW,"First off, I'll start by saying that I hated the first CHARLIES ANGELS movie. I thought it had absolutely no story and, aside from starring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, offered nothing noteworthy at all other than how bad I thought it was. So, of course I was hesitant to say the least to see the sequel, although I thought the trailers made the film look ""fun"".  That ""fun"" vibe (and Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz) is what made me eventually give the film a look see.  What did I think?
Packed with jump cuts, slow motion sequences, freeze frames, celebrity cameos (Bruce Willis, Robert Forster, The Olsen Twins, Eve, and more), song after song after song, and scantly clad women, the first thirty minutes of CHARLIES ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE are fun, exciting, and at times, even intentionally funny (something the first film never accomplished in my opinion). However, after the first thirty or so minutes the film begins to run out of steam. While the visuals are nice for a while, the film has no identifiable plot and the action and the visuals eventually become tiresome and repetitive. I like the style of the film and I thoroughly enjoyed the motorbike chase scene. One day I'm almost sure that director McG is going to make something that will blow me and everyone else away but this just isn't it. If the film had a thirty-minute running time I would have thought it was excellent but as a movie pushing two hours it had me constantly checking my watch for the time. While it would have made a great, kick a-- episode of the CHARLIES ANGELS television show it ends up falling flat as a film.

1473563,3,B00005JLYW,"MY FEEDBACK:
1) If you could enjoy the first movie you should be able to enjoy this one. It was the same comedy/action found in the first but with a bit more sensuality.

2) Speaking about sensuality, it did get tiring after a while seeing all the butt and cleavage shots. It is like McG had to add a little something more than the first movie and he opted for more sex instead of better story. Too bad, which is why I knocked this rating down.

3) He did try to get a bit more characterization going by introducing a past to Barrymore's character and Lui's character. Cameron's character doesn't have so much as a past as an attempt to develop her continuing relationship with Wilson. Overall, I like the attempt made at deepening the characters. Whether the attempt was successful or not is a matter of opinion.

4) Demi Moore, was great! Her raspy voice and great 40+yr old chisled body didn't seem at all out of place in a movie dominated by 20 year old women. Hats off to Demi.

OVERALL: I'm glad I rented it and didn't see it at the going movie theater rate. Will I own it? Probably not because my wife didn't like it at all and I thought it was only a tad better than GOOD, but far from GREAT. If they come out a with a third installment to the series I will definitely watch, but I won't be holding my breath for it. This is a take it or leave it flick.",1067212800,,1361,4.203065134099617

1473566,1,B00005JLYW,"Ordinarily, I wouldn't even waste time even thinking about ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle."" Then I realized that somebody, somewhere, must speak out against this idiotic excuse for a movie. We rented this flick on a slow (slow, sloooow) weekend night and somehow sat through to the end. A few of the gags and cameos at the beginning of the movie provoked some unexpected laughs from Yours Truly. Then, after about half an hour, I realized what a boondoggle mess ""Full Throttle"" is and the laughter ceased.
I hate this movie NOT because I am ""anti chick-flick"" or ""anti-women"" or because I doubt whether female actors can produce a mindless action flick as well as a Tom Cruise or a Harrison Ford can. I hate this movie because it represents a kind of death of cinema. Because it has no plot, no story WHATSOEVER, merely a series of lame, pointless action scenes building up to nothing at all. I hate it because it cheats the audience with one gimmicky, ridiculous, unbelievable CGI action sequence after another. I sat staring at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief during so many scenes. I mean, does producer Drew Barrymore think we're stupid, or what?
""The Matrix"" movies contain just as many CGI shots (OK, more), but at least they contain a kernel of plot, some semblance of story. I could go back into ancient mythology and find the inspirations for Neo, Morpheus and the like. Not so ""Full Throttle."" Its most basic inspiration is, like so many of today's big-budget Hollywood train wrecks, a TV crime show that's more than 25 years old. It's so bad that it doesn't even qualify as a bad sequel -- it couldn't possibly make any difference that this film had a predecessor. Its real inspiration is cynicism; Drew Barrymore hit upon an idea for a pop cultural franchise that would keep her career alive, and Sony is going to milk it for every dollar.
Fortunately, ""Full Throttle"" wasn't exactly ""full throttle"" at the box office. People caught a whiff and stayed away.
This movie is why I loved ""Open Range.""
Everyone associated with any ""Charlie's Angels"" movie should be ashamed. It's certainly a black mark on Cameron Diaz.

1473567,1,B00005JLYW,"Charlies Angels:Full Throttle is a major disappointment...aimed at teens and CGI enthusiasts...this sequel loses the experienced film-watcher right away.
First the cast: I am fond of Drew Barrymore - but let's face it -she's marginally talented as an actress, and likes to portray herself as a bad-ass when you know the girl has never yearned for a hot meal in her life... Lucy Lui: The only Angel to escape this ground-zero with any dignity - eventhough she's not even in the film (consciously)...and no one thinks Cameron Diaz is cuter than Cameron Diaz - if I have to endure another goofy smile or butt-shaking dance-by-herself sequence, I swear I'm gonna retch.
Bill Murray: Absent and missed. Bernie Mac: Dull and uninfluential (but that's probably the script's fault, which can be blamed for a fair share of this mess) Demi Moore: Finally, a role that requires litte effort on her part - superb**ch...
Directed with the obvious burden of topping the original, this 2hr. music video is shockingly violent (eventhough the Angels don't use handguns - there are plenty of bullets and blood - coupled with militaristic references and settings - just in case your belly isn't full of war...)
The special effects are not believable - and I don't know about you, but that ruins it for me. In a word - a total joke that's not wotrth the plastic it's pressed on.",1066953600,,1358,4.832618025751073

1473571,1,B00005JLYW,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle should have been renamed to
Charlie's Angels: Everything But The Kitchen Sink.
Because?
Well because the director took it upon himself to throw just about every plot cliche and pop idol, explosion, popular actor/actress to get you the viewer to see this drivel.
Say what is the plot to this film?
Plot?  I equate the plot to Swiss cheese.  Swiss has holes and the plot to Full Throttle has plot holes so big I can drive my car through them (I drive a Buick LeSabre BTW).  I always thought that Charlie Townsend ran a detective agency and not a top secrete spy shop ala CIA, NSA...etc.
 The beginning of the film has the angels in Mongolia of all places trying to bust out a justice department workers.  My question, which never is addressed, is how did this guy end
up in Mongolia, especially if he holds one piece of a ring that holds encrypted ids for the witness protection program?
On top of that, the other ring, on the hands of another justice department worker is assassinated along with a whole team of agents.  My question is if you knew the first ring was stolen, wouldn't you want to maybe lockup the 2nd ring instead of
giving it to some guy to waltz around with?  Or better yet, why store this info on rings to begin with?
Then lets stretch our disbelief by having 3 chicks perform all these physics defying martial art moves and escape Mongolia with the kidnapped worker sans the ring.
Of course as the angels try to track down who stole the ring, they uncover that Dylan (Drew Barymore's character) is in the witness protection program (plot cliche).  Why who would've thunk of that?!
Also lets add that Dylan's ex-boyfriend, get released from a maximum security prison. Only after serving 8 years in jail. Well - I guess thats believable, right? Sort of like having John Giotti get out of jail and nobody says anything.
 Hello?
While we're at it, why not throw in Crispin Glover's Thin Man character from the 1st Charlie Angels film.  Crispin's character is now reduced to a mysterious screaming, hair sniffing Gomez Adams wannabe instead of the more intriguing martial arts sword
wielding henchman of the first film.  Also the director and writers try, why I'll never know, to make Glover's character sympathetic and get the audience to feel for this guy.
Like all of a sudden the movie wants to be character driven instead of plot driven?  My response to this is perhaps the director needs to get off the junk and think about where this story is going.
But, hey, lets not stop there.  Perhaps the audience will become board at lack of plot and the switching between driving this puppy by character or something trying to be a plot.  Lets throw in some pop stars like Pink or hey, Bruce Willis into the mix to generate some interest!  Hey, how about throwing in Jacqueline Smith into the film to give a T.V. Charlie's Angels passing the mantle to the new Charlie Angels.  Wouldn't that be great.
By this time my wife is asking me why I'm more interested in reading my Newsweek magazine instead of watching anymore of this nightmare.

1473689,4,B00005JLYW,"Sometimes going into a movie with REALLY lowered expectations is a good thing, and that's exactly what I did when I saw ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle."" Though the first film had its good, fun moments, it inevitably grew old and tiresome toward the end and never really solidified itself as even a ""good bad"" movie. ""Full Throttle,"" though, is somehow amazingly fun and even some kind of a good movie. Director McG takes modern pop filmmaking to its zenith with Matrix-inspired fight scenes, outlandish special effects, and (surprisingly) laugh-out-loud comedy. Not to mention a few PG-13-envelope-pushing scenes that make this an instant classic for any guy.
Sure, the plot of the movie is REALLY thin, if even existent, and some of the subplots test a sensible viewer's patience (one involving Barrymore's character and a Witness Protection Program is eye-rollingly ridiculous). McG knows that his movies would pretty much flop if heavy on plot, so he fills the void with fantastic action sequences and cleverly executed pop culture references that are more of a film-lover's treat than a spoof (look for nods to ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""Night of the Hunter,"" and even TV's ""CSI""). Much like first movie, though, it does have its rough spots where it sags, but they are not as numerous as ""Full Throttle""'s predecessor and they are redeemed. How can one forget a drop-dead sexy Demi Moore; Cameron Diaz swimming in a martini glass or riding a mechanical bull; or the Angels grooving and writhing in a seductively bawdy, full-blown dance number?
That's the great thing about ""Full Throttle."" It manages to coast COMPLETELY on brainless whimsy and not really insult the viewer in the process. In fact, in a way, it's kind of rewarding. ""Full Throttle"" has the look of a cutting-edge action spectacle, but the sensibility of a classic adventure flick. Guys may be taken by the female beauty in the film (as this reviewer was), and women may scoff at it, but even the serious filmgoer won't be able to keep a grin off their face. It's great fun, but don't go into this expecting a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-quality picture, because ""Raiders"" this ain't. This review may be glowing, but it's still not hard to see the dramatic and narrative limitations of such a film. Do yourself a favor, though, and forget all of that heavy film jargon. Why beat ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" down when it succeeds so well in being the funnest, most viscerally exciting movie of the year?",1066608000,2,2476,4.897619047619048
1473690,2,B00005JLYW,"Attacking ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" is a bit like shooting secret agents in a barrel; there's just not a lot of sport in it because it's way too easy to do.
Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore return as the giggly, jiggly trio who, we're supposed to believe, are amazing, expert crime fighters.  About the only way this material stands even a chance of succeeding is if the filmmakers treat it like some over-the-top, live action cartoon (or is it video game?) - which is pretty much what they've done.  Unfortunately, it turns out to be a cartoon almost totally devoid of wit, creativity and charm.  The plot mainly consists of finding ways to get the girls into campy costumes and situations.  Thus we have the angels as nuns, the angels as welders, the angels as exotic dancers.  The problem is that this cutesiness wears awfully thin after awhile, especially since that is pretty much all the screenplay manages to come up with in the way of entertainment.
The stunt sequences - which consist mainly of tedious slow-motion shots of the girls flipping through the air, karate-chopping the bad guys and dodging bullets - are so excessive in nature that we begin to understand what a detrimental effect ""The Matrix"" (however inadvertently) has had on filmmaking in the past few years.  When any physical action - no matter how contrary to the laws of physics and gravity - is possible, how are we supposed to care what happens to the people involved?  If no one seems to be in any real danger, all possible suspense is eliminated and we are left admiring the work of the special effects team and very little else.  The ""Charlie's Angels"" films are not alone in this regard, but they do serve as handy warning signs of the potentially debilitating effect of this trend on the future of action movies.
About halfway through the film, Jaclyn Smith, one of the angels from the original TV series, shows up to dispense some veteran advice to one of our intrepid little cherubs.  Though long past her prime, Smith is so goddess-y beautiful in her brief moments on screen that, not only does she outclass all three of the leading players, but she makes us, heaven forbid, even feel a twinge of nostalgia - however faint - for the original series.  Frankly, I didn't think that was possible.  Credit the makers of this fiasco for achieving at least that much with their film.",1066521600,20,2382,4.701923076923077

This is a great fun movie.  It has tons of action, and comedy.  This is one of the best movies of the summer.  Though it a bubbly fun movie does not make it stupid.  It is not suposed to be taken seriously.  The points is to have fun, and laugh.  If I could I'd give this movie a 10/5, just for taking a risk, and succeeding.  Trust me I wouldn't have gone to see it in theaters four times if it had not been a good fun movie.  This would have to be my favorite movie of all time, which is also tied with the origional "" Charlie's Angels"".  I cannont decide which one I like better.",1066089600,3,850,4.153374233128834
1473794,4,B00005JLYW,"This movie was silly, dumb, an unnecessary sequel to a fluffy, ridiculous film. CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE gives its viewers an excuse to ogle Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Demi Moore in revealing, tight costumes while barely supplying its viewers with a plot and forcing us to watch a film so freakishly edited together that it feels like a two-hour music video. The stunts are so fake that you start thinking, ""Hey, the green-screen appears so often it should get a screen credit and percentage of the gross."" It's a ludicrous film.
That said, damn if the thing isn't occasionally lots and lots of fun.
Like its predecessor, FULL THROTTLE gives us hot chicks, hot guys, loads of fun action and ridiculously contrived situations. The jokes, though they fly as often as they did in the first movie, aren't as funny, but you still get to see Cameron Diaz dress as a really, really butch lesbian AND dance to MC Hammer, so who cares?
The DVD is unrated. I don't know exactly how exploitative this new version of the film is going to get, other than through adding more dumb sex jokes. But if there are more scenes added where the sweaty, buff and bad-accented Justin Theroux or any of the Angels go shirtless, then I hate to admit it ... but I'm so there.",1064966400,3,1271,4.60352422907489

But let me tell you that after 30 minutes I was coming crazy with it because there was nothing good about it and I was hoping Demi would kill the angels so it could be over so I could leave the theatre and the most important thing that there will never be Charlie's angels 3.
I may be hard about this movie but I'm being honest, if you haven't seen it you don't know how borring and stupid it is. Besides I don't understand how Jackelyn Smith (singer Pink also appears in the film) agreed to appear in the movie because honestly it's an insult to her good work as an original angel.

To further explain: this movie is far from finished - you get the distinct impression you are watching a rough draft, as this isn't so much a movie as a sequence of (oftentimes unrelated) scenes watched back to back.  The plot was so thin, it was utterly incapable of holding this hodge-podge of scenes together; what results is some lame jokes (almost all repeats from the first film), a lot of pointless action, several pointless characters (what was the point of that orphan kid, or the ""thin man"" from the first movie, anyway?), and about 2 wasted hours of your time.

I realized, that the second movie made after a big success is never as good as the first one ... but even that idea could not have explained how bad this film was.

I cannot think of a worst way to spend an evening when you would like to relax and enjoy time with friends. At a certain point, the film became so boring and predictable that I started to look at my watch to see when the torture would end.
These girls (I admit, very good looking and sexy) are involved in a mission to save several lives, but the plot is mindless, exaggerated, and all the fighting and kicking seems to be badly copied from The Matrix, in terms of film technology used. The story is silly and goofy, and the film tries to cover that up using too many special effects and sound that is too loud. It's a complete waste if we judge by the big budget this movie had.

If you don't want to have a ruined evening, I suggest you stay home and pass your time in a different way.

1473892,2,B00005JLYW,"I loved the first Charlie's Angels.  It was kitchy, outrageous, funny and had three girls kicking butt.  It didn't take itself seriously -- kind of like the show -- and that was the reason it was fun.  It wasn't supposed to be Indiana Jones-serious and I went into it knowing that.  The sequel... could have been done better, unfortunately.  But, it's not without it's charm.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.
The good:
Well, the three original characters are back and they have more adventures, more stunts, more fights and plays up to all of them nicely.  You have Demi Moore playing an angel gone bad, which was a nice twist and a handful of cameos.  Cameron Diaz being the loveable ditz is hysterical.
The bad:
There's a number of things here that I just have to write about.  The storyline is choppy and ill-written.  The first's storyline was outrageous, but it worked.  This one is so out there with too many characters, too many bad guys, too many subplots that it was overkill.  You have Dylan's past coming back to haunt her, Alex's father thinking she's into prostitution, Natalie's relationship with her now live-in boyfriend, creepy thin-man with absolutely no purpose and Matt LeBlanc who should have never been written back in, top that off with the Halo rings that have been stolen and so many characters playing bad guys you get lost.  The script should have been worked on much harder and longer; it's like the first Tomb Raider, it just concentrates too much on action and the serious moments are really unnecessary.  This movie tries to be more dramatic in areas that really are wasted, (i.e., Dylan coming to terms with the fact that the Angels will eventually split up down the road, sob! sob! Oh, c'mon!)
There's too many one-liners, (they actually use the term bee-yatch... GAG! Why didn't they just throw in blang, blang, while they were at it?) making it highly annoying at times.  Bernie Mac, although I love his show, was VERY much badly cast as Bosley.  They should have offered Murray a lot of money to reprise his role because there are just too many times that the Mac is just annoying and wasted.  Creepy thin man (Crispin Glover) who was brilliant in the first movie, reprises his role and unfortunately they give some of his background.  WHY was this necessary!?!  Plus, for absolutely no reason, he gets involved with the Angels which you will see.  They kill the mystery of the creepy thin man in this sequel.
Matt LeBlanc and John Cleese's roles are completely wasted on a useless subplot around Alex (mistakening her for a prostitute, Charlie being her pimp.)  Demi Moore makes a great bad angel.  She's hip, fun and wicked... she's just overdone.  Her role starts too far into the movie and she acts like she's making up  for it.  She only surfaces in the last third of the movie.  Plus, it's really obvious she's trying to upstage her three younger costars.  Demi is definitely lovely eyecandy for the guys out there, and considering how the world knew that she spent a lot of money on resculpting, concentration is focused on how she looks rather than her role.
Plus, it's really obvious that Drew Barrymore had a lot of creative control in this flick.  She's heavily into gun control (so only the bad guys have guns, and they kinda make a point of that, which gets a little preachy) her plots/subplots overshadow her two costars, which I found annoying and she has the most camera time.  Drew, next time, share.  The one thing I did like is that she's not as glamorous as her two partners, which was a nice twist.
So, it's with heavy hesitation that I say it was fair.  I had hoped that it would have been as good as the first, but apparently it didn't do too well in the box office, so if there's a third installment, I'll be surprised.  I won't be buying this... maybe rent it if there's nothing else to rent, but I'd recommend sticking to the first.  Two out of five stars for bad script and bad focus.",1062288000,2,3940,4.614942528735632

1473897,4,B00005JLYW,"`Full Throttle' embraces better stunts than the first Charlie's Angels, in addition to better laughs and a whole new kick bum dance routine from Natalie (Miss Diaz), which is now becoming an anticipated groove in the box office flick.
As a relaxing remedy, food and drink usually have presence when I watch a film. Unfortunately `Full Throttle' barely gives you time to digest the snowball of stunts which are so breath-taking even a glimpse away from the screen to reach for the popcorn would cause non-stop choking.  I really cannot remember a better 10-minute opening sequence full of hard-hitting action events since `Indian Jones The Temple Of Doom.'  The visual effects team from the Matrix will surely feel embarrassed by the sheer efforts of this film.
The plot. Who needs one?  No really. This time the angels investigate a series of murders that occur due to the possession of some vital wedding rings that hold confidential identity information. As usual they use their clever disguises to fool high authorities and law enforcers in order to unravel the mysterious deaths that are occurring. An ex-boyfriend of Dylan (Drew Barrymore) gets a suspicious release from prison despite having a life sentence for a murder, which consequently was witnessed by Dylan several years in the past.  Crispin Glover plays the Thin man, who has an obsession with pulling peoples hair out and then sniffing it. Madison (Demi Moore) is the ex-Charlie's angel who is overwhelming idolised by her successors Alex (Lucy Liu), Dylan and Natalie.
The ex-boyfriend, the thin man and Madison become prime suspects for the murders and with the release of her ex-boyfriend, Dylan decides that it would be best if she left the angels because she could be putting her two best friends lives at risk.  Alex's father (John Cleese) steals the show with his unexpected arrival. Unaware that his daughter is actually a special agent is led to believe that Alex works in a hospital. Later, Alex's film star boyfriend Jason (Matt Le Blanc) spills the beans to her father making him think that his daughter is actually a prostitute and not a nurse after all.
You have 105 minutes of enthralling action; three young sexy ladies strutting their stuff in direct homage to MC Hammer; beautifully choreographed acrobats and martial arts and above all - really cool motorbike stunt races!  You will laugh your socks off!
Things to look out for: - P!nk whose acting is surprisingly worse than her singing; who would have guessed?  A quick cameo shot of an elderly Bruce Willis. Matt Le Blanc still playing nothing other than his usual Joey character...how predictable!

1474024,3,B00005JLYW,"Yeah, it's mindless, loud, excessive, gratuitous, and even flawed -- but who cares? I've seen this film twice, and it hasn't yet kept a smile off my face. Mind you, I'm not usually entertained by this sort of... stuff. I'm more of an avid watcher of the Sundance and Independent Film Channel, than HBO, Showtime, and Starz. Why, I ask, should I feel guilty about a film that makes me feel this giddy -- critically panned or not -- I just don't know.
Part of the movie's charm lies in the performances by the three Angels. No, they don't give any Oscar-worthy perfs. But for a sequel -- a sequel destined for negative reviews from high-minded critics -- Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz, perform with the abandone of child actors unaware of silly movie business things, like critics and box-office. Whose only inspiration for performing in this franchise, anyway, is just to have a good ol' time.
And in having such a good ol' time, the Angels celebrate girl power, by using their sex appeal as a weapon to deter guys too horny to learn of their schemes. But at the same time as they are proving women's superiority over men, they're giving their libido's a treat. There's a sequence late in the film when the Angels perform as Pussycat Dolls. And despite the limitations of the PG-13 rating, it's easily the sexiest scene in a film starring sexy women, directed by a filmmaker who acknowledges their sex-appeal, and exploits it.
While the film contains a great amount of action sequences, the movie never asks that you feel danger for the well-being of the characters. You know none of them will die, let alone get a scratch. The purpose of the action scenes, it seems, is simply that you awe at the rediculousness of it all (and if you aren't humored by the film's first action sequence, then you might as well just walk out).
There have been criticisms pointed at the film for ripping-off the gravity-defying fighting scenes of The Matrix for superficial reasons. But Angels is more homage, or parody, than a rip-off that asks you to take it seriously. Too much of what occurs in this movie would most certainly not happen in reality. But these are Angels, after all. And first and foremost, they're characters of a fictional film. Who says their actions have to obey by the laws of reality? Watch a Dogme film for that.
But if the excessiveness and implausibility of the action scenes don't tickle your funny bone, then maybe Bernie Mac will, who is my favorite comedian working today. At first, he seemed to be overwhelmed by the presence of the gorgeous Angels. But upon second view, I found him funnier and a lot more relaxed. However, the funniest bits of the film surprisingly come from an actor who may or may not be reaching for laughs.
Justin Theroux, of David Lynch's Mulholland Dr., plays the ex-lover of Barrymore's character. He's got a thick Irish accent that is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. And when he says, ""Give us the rings,"" I couldn't stop lauging. He's also got a physique that is too exaggerated in its chisledness to not be humorous.
I Don't Wanna Grow Up, I'm a Charlie's Angel
Speaking of adolescence, there's a bit of business in the film about the Angels fearing the actual entrance into adulthood. Barrymore's character suspects that Diaz's boyfriend, played by Luke Wilson, is going to ask her to marry him. After which, Barrymore daydreams of the Angels gradually breaking up, and -- whatdoyahknow -- eventually growing old. There's also a scene between Liu and her father, played by John Cleese (his facial-expressions of shock after learning of what his little angel actually does for a living are hilarious), where she tells him that being an Angel makes her feel alive -- as opposed to being a Neurosurgeon, which would otherwise make her feel like just an ordinary adult working for the dollar.
Considering this, you get the feeling that, for the most part of the Angels' crime-fighting life, mentally, they're still the little girls hovering over Superwoman comics that they once were: Dreaming of one day kicking the butts of baddies, and never once ruining their make-up and angelic faces; and at the end of the day, making-out with their gorgeous boyfriends.
However, they're eventually going to have to ""grow-up."" They will age. And they will have to quit being Angels. But for now -- to quote Gene Hackman from The Royal Tenenbaums -- they're ""living' it up,"" and ""loving every damn moment with this crew."" And so are we -- or, so am I, rather. I could give a damn what anyone else thinks.",1058572800,2,4557,4.718946047678796

Two of the angels are trying to rescue an important person held hostage while the other one rides a mechanical bull in a skimpy fluffy white dress. Moving in slo-mo for many scenes in the movie, this movie is usually hard to follow. The all-out action sequences are sometimes cool but get tiring after they repeat themselves.

1474028,5,B00005JLYW,"""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" just may be the hottest ticket going this summer, and with good reason. With three beautiful ""Angels"" showing they can deliver the goods while kicking some major butt in the process (complete with an action-packed storyline), it's one motion picture that's difficult to resist, let alone ignore. The film's plotline finds Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) on the trail of two pricey gold rings. Major adventure and high-speed mayhem ensues, as the Angels employ some divine intervention to try to recover the lost rings. Along the way, our dynamite trio meet another Angel, one Madison Lee (Demi Moore), whom we learn is the mastermind behind the entire smugging ""ring"". We also learn Lee was once part of the Angels' team, and has vowed to terminate our beloved debonair ladies once and for all. Moore's ex-husband Bruce Willis has a major role (although somewhat brief) as the original boss and holder of the rings, but is somewhat of a disappointment as his character is killed off. At least it was nice to see him get some screen time in. It's also great to see John Cleese make an appearance as Alex's father, although the comedy that was brought to the forefront in his Monty Python films really isn't present here. Even Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith have brief cameos here, for it wouldn't be a Charlie's Angels movie without them present. Bernie Mac as Bosley adds the perfect comedic touch to a dramatic display that's one part James Bond combined with one part, shall we say, Monty Python (!)?  Well, maybe not Python, but as for the ""comedy"" aspect of ""CA:FT"", maybe something more along the lines of the ""Airplane"" movies would be a more accurate description. Although this sequel tends to drag in a few places, it is worthy of all five stars for its star factor and rewatchability quality, which makes ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"", an all-out, horsepower-driven affair that's sure to entice, as well as delight, even the most fussy of moviegoers this summer season. Be sure to seek some ""divine intervention"" at your local theater today!",1058140800,,2124,4.932960893854749
1474029,3,B00005JLYW,"Utterly ridiculous, completely brainless, and a goofy, giggly, guilty pleasure, Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle is a mesmerizing display of what modern cinema can accomplish when a director is given a blank check and unlimited access to the wardrobe and special effects departments.  You know what to expect when the girls take on an entire camp of Mongolian thugs, dodge tank fire and missile launchers, crash through the top of a mile-high dam, hitch a ride on a helicopter on the way down with hostage in tow, and still manage to laugh their way back to Los Angeles.  We also find out Cameron Diaz can ride a mechanical bull, Drew Barrymore can out drink any man, and Lucy Liu can unscrew twelve-inch wood screws with her rear-end, all within the first five minutes of the movie.
Forget jiggle television, this is the new Charlie's Angels.  These girls are hot and director McG forces you to accept this.  From the close-up shots and leering camera angles, to the outfits that never last more than three minutes, to the suggestive dance numbers and dialogue, these girls spin, kick, fly, motocross, luge, and catch bullets in their Wonderbra kevlar vests without any hairs getting out of place.  But don't worry girls, you'll be happy to know all men have six-pack abs and never wear shirts.
I suppose I could take the popular route and trash this movie like the majority of the critics.  It's aimed squarely at the A.D.D. generation that can't watch a music video without additional stimulation. The freshness of the ""girl power"" television show was beat to death on the first movie.  This time it was flattened with a steamroller.  And the inane, nonstop giggling of these teenagers trapped in adult bodies is enough to drive you to self-mutilation.  It's one movie that is much improved with the sound off.  Yet somehow Full Throttle succeeds in spite of it all.  Perhaps it's because I was expecting all of this upfront?  I don't know - I still haven't turned my brain back on.",1057968000,,1985,4.771929824561403

The over load of action does not make up for the lack of story. And get this.. the villian is played by Gumby wearing a Demi Moore mask. I even noticed some wires that failed to be edited out. Here is the plot in one sentence. Two rings must come together. Sorry but I forgot why. It just wasn't worth remembering. I thought that director McG did a pretty good job with the first, but he simply over did everything with this one. You've heard of an artist spashing on a little color and he ends up with a masterpeice. But if he doesn't know when to stop he ruins it. This is where the ignorant saying ""Less is more"" comes in to play. Better luck with CA3.",1057363200,3,814,4.158227848101266
1474031,5,B00005JLYW,"This movie was a feel good time.  Pink put it so perfectly.  The movie had a fun matrix feel to it and it was easy to follow.  Obviously the movie is very predictable; however it was much better than the first one.  It was loud, exciting, mindless fun.  Each angel is great. Camron D. is hysterical and seems to be the head angel b/c she does most of the stuff.  Drew and Lucy Lui are great and fun.  The fashion in the movie is amazing.  Each girl looks amazing in each scene.  Their outfits are amazing.  They wear great boots also.  The clothes would be the one reason I would go to see this movie.  Okay Demi Moore looks good from far away.  In her close ups her skin kinda hangs; it is a little gross.  The movie was fun. Now go see it!!!",1057363200,,743,4.069444444444445
1474032,4,B00005JLYW,"There was no question that the extremely popular, highly profitable 2000 film version of the TV series,Charlie's Angels, would have a sequel. And now, here it is, with the three beautful and talented ladies returning to their roles. This time, they are joined by 'original' angel Kelly Garett, played by Jaclyn Smith, and 'fallen' angel Madison Lee, played by a beautifully remade Demi Moore. Clever cameos add to the excitement, making this installment as good as the first.
These angels get to kick...in sexy clothes and stiletto heels. They get to run in slow motion as highly flammable stuff explodes behind them. They get to save the day and look fabulous doing it. And all the while, in true girl-power movie fashion, they stay true to each other. Sure, things get a little ridiculous sometimes, but it's all extremely entertaining and so much fun.
In the opening sequence, for example, after effortlessly fighting off a room full of angry Mongolians, they plunge off a bridge in an armored truck to what should be their fiery death. But angels Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are so plucky, so resourceful, so gosh-darned indefatigable, they just hop onto a helicopter - which happened to be inside the armored truck - and fly away to safety. ""I'm afraid I underestimated you guys,"" a U.S. marshal they've rescued (played by Robert Patrick) remarks afterward. ""Yeah,"" perky Natalie replies, her blinding grin seemingly taking up her entire face. ""That happens a lot."" Maybe our heroines get shortchanged in the plot and dialogue departments - but as was the case with the '70s TV show the movie is based on, those things don't really matter, do they? That's not what you came to see.
The ""Charlie's Angels"" movies are all about having an unabashedly campy good time - and this is where a music-video background comes in handy for director McG, who made his feature-film debut with the original. ""Full Throttle"" is bigger, better, faster and more fun than the first - self-aware without being too cutesy, savvy without being tragically hip. It's a great addition to the long line of summer sequels. And wow, those outfits!",1057363200,,2163,4.928767123287671
1474033,4,B00005JLYW,"That's the phrase that kept popping into my head every time the Angels--Cameron, Drew, and Lucy--engaged in one of their frequent kicking and punching ecstasies. Cameron especially seemed to glory in her role as a violent cheerleader type. Plot has to do with retrieving two rings that if used together, reveal the new names and locations of every single person in the witness protection program--including, shockingly, one of the Angels herself!
So we also have soul-searching episodes when one of the Angels knows fear deep down inside that if she doesn't leave the trio, the other two gals might get hurt. An interesting aside to this (which probably wasn't intentional) is that there is something a little too real to the Angel's somewhat paralyzed response to seeing her former abusive boyfriend. Here we've seen her beat all manner of people up in the movie, but she seems terrified of this guy, so it brings to mind the emotional problems many abused women do have trying to sever from an abuser.
However, not to dwell on that too much. I didn't see the first movie, so in reading other reviews, I see that there have been cast changes and continuing characters as well. Doesn't matter a jot if you're new to the ""Charlie's Angels"" scene. It was interesting to see that Demi Moore is our villainess, and that many of the reviewers are, ""wow, she's really old at 40"". Mix of age-ism and sexism, I guess, on their parts.
Shakespeare it ain't. If, however, you want to vege out in an air-conditioned theatre and watch an upbeat nonsensical action movie, then ""Full Throttle""'s for you.",1057363200,,1589,4.802919708029197
1474147,1,B00005JLYW,"I loved the first one. This one looks like a [bad] ten minute sketch from Saturday Night Live spoofing Hollywood expanded to movie length. I really need a thesaurus to give this movie its true description. I just don't have all the words I need. But, I can start with inane, insipid, incomprehensible, idiotic. What a waste of cuties in this extended music video. It wanders and never ends up anywhere. It reminds me of a couple of stoners let loose in a movie studio. ""OOooh, we can get John Cleese and Demi Moore. Ooooh, let's put in that Who song.""",1057276800,,551,4.465346534653466

1474149,4,B00005JLYW,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, let me explain that I loved the first Charlie's Angels and was really looking forward to the sequal. I was hoping for the same blend of silly fun, girl power, great stunts, and that we-don't-take-any-of-this-too-seriously tone of the first that gelled into high marks on the likeability scale, the only scale that counts for a fluff movie like this one. After all, it's unrealistic to hope for a great plot - this isn't the type of movie that depends on plot.
Anyway, the first film gelled and is one I can watch over and over for fun and simple pleasure. For many reasons, the sequal is not a movie I expect to own once it comes out on DVD.
The Angels are as great as ever, the action sequences, as promised, are overblown, intense, and highly implausible. The girls prove once again that nothing is beyond their power. They can hop on any machine and excel in any extreme sport. They look like an ad for Sobe drinks.
Unfortunately, the action scenes are too implausible to be believed and the wire work is much more obvious this time around. People defy gravity, walk through towering flames shirtless without getting burned, many times I found myself thinking ""Oh yeah right!"" instead of ""Yeah, right on!""
Bruce Willis makes a cameo and gets to die on screen for perhaps the first time. Bernie Mac is a wonderful comic but he doesn't seem at ease in this film. He just seems out of place. He doesn't know what function he's supposed to perform for the agency! And when he's called into action he's a nervous wreck. Some people found it funny but I thought it was mean.
As befits a sequel we get to see more of how the Angels are faring in their personal lives. Are their romances progressing?
John Cleese makes an appearance as Lucy Liu's father (they show a family picture, only her mother is Asian). It's an obvious attempt to get some humor in the movie but is so tacked-on and unnecessary that it seems more an attempt to get in some cheaper screen filler. Matt Le Blanc reappears as the boyfriend, but isn't given much to do, and their relationship doesn't progress at all.
Cameron and her beau move in together, making Dylan feel insecure about the Angels breaking up sooner than expected. To reassure her, Jaclyn Smith makes a nice cameo appearence, looking great with her special brand of soft beauty and poise.
Where they really went wrong was with the casting of the bad guys. The Irish mob guy wanting to exact revenge on Dylan (who we find out, has a past that includes the Witness Protection Program) is just plain silly. He's trying to be Colin Farrel but he doesn't have the looks or charisma. When he struts around like a bad [...] you just want to roll your eyes. The actor who played T2000 in T2 is also on board, another rather unexpressionless automaton. The first rule of any thriller is we have to be afraid of the bad guys, we have to respect them as threats to our heroines. The creepy thin guy (professional weirdo Crispin Glover, always a pleasure) also returns but this time as a rather good guy. This is a fun choice but how it all turns out is extremely disappointing, another big mark dragging down the likeability scale.
Demi Moore looked way too thin, both physically and emotionally. Her eyes were dead empty (which made sense for the character I guess), it almost seemed like she was characteurizing her ex-hubby's acting style of complete non-reaction as the best response for everything. The only reason she's a threat to the Angels is because she's packing guns, something the first movie did without, a choice I much applauded it for. This movie goes back to using guns and it's just too bad that they did.
The opening sequence is so totally perfect, the best representation of why we love the Angels so much because it has the right blend of sillyness with Cameron Diaz playing a Swedish blond bimbo distracting a bunch of hardened soldiers by riding a mechanical bull. Her infectious grin and unique cackle makes this totally plausible. They escape by piloting a falling plane in mid-air, very much like the opening scene from the 007 film, ""Goldeneye."" Unfortunately, after that the movie's tone becomes either all action or all bad comedy (McG really has to learn how to use different lenses, he tends to only use extreme close-ups as if to say ""you should be laughing at Cleese now."").
If nothing else, this movie could be a documentary for fads of the new milleneum.
In short, while there's great action, a wonderful attitude about girl power, the three stars don't seem as great somehow because the bad guys don't force them to be interesting, they've already been introduced and their personal lives aren't engaging or surprising, the dialogue attempts to be witty through the use of excessive puns, and there's too much angst on the part of Dylan for the girls to keep that happy-go-lucky attitude they had in the first film. You may enjoy it somewhat while you're watching it, but soon you'll be wondering why the use of wires is so obvious, and why the laughs they strive too hard for just don't come. Something's not quite right...
So I recommend you only pay matinee prices if you want to see the special effects and great pyrotechnics on the big screen, otherwise wait for it to appear on cable. I'm giving this 4 stars because the Angels are awesome but I really expected better.",1057190400,,5375,4.623430962343096
1474150,5,B00005JLYW,"I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it the day it came out. The action was much bigger, the dancing was much cooler, and it was sillier than the first. Bernie Mac and Demi Moore made great additions to the sequel. The whole thing about Dylan's name in the past (Helen Zaas) was very funny. The cameos were cool( the Olsen Twins and Eve). As soon as this movie comes out on DVD, I'm going to go get it. Go see this movie. It's really good and you won't have fun at any other movie.",1057190400,,479,4.052631578947368
1474151,4,B00005JLYW,"I went to see this movie on opening weekend and expected to be packed in with hundreds of other people.  When I walked in (during previews) the theater was less than half full.  Anyway, about the movie.  I must say that the movie was funny.  With all of the inside jokes and endless physical humor going on, what else would it be.  I must say that casting Demi Moore as the Angel gone bad was a bit of a stretch. I do disagree with one reviewer of this film, who stated that replacing the Bosley character was a mistake.  If the Charlie's Angels films stayed with the same format as the television series then the Angels would carry guns, instead of using their intelligence to reason through a situation.  In this way, I applaud what Drew Barrymore has tried to do in remaking the ""Angels"".  There are a lot of movies out there which use guns endlessly.  I prefer to go to a movie that allows you to watch a hero or heroine reason their way out of a situation, instead of falling back on bang, bang, shoot 'em dead.  I am very glad that they brought back Jacqueline Smith in a cameo.  This is a great way of continuing the tradition and passing on the wisdom of one Angel to another.  I guess you could say that aside from a few points in the movie that didn't quite make sense (i.e. The Thin Man turning good and no explanation why) I enjoyed this movie a great deal and will purchase it when it comes out on videotape.",1057017600,,1421,4.2611940298507465

1474153,4,B00005JLYW,"Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle is going to be one of those great unintentional parody movies and has cult movie potential.
Unlike ""Loaded Weapon"" or ""Naked Gun"", ""Full Throttle"" appears to be attempting serious action sequences and a real story line.  The fun part is that the action sequences are so completely over the top that you can't help but laugh and not take the film seriously.
This move ends up being pure camp.  I'm looking forward to seeing this one again just to take a closer look at the various references like:
- The scene where one of the bad-guys walks straight through/out of a fire just like in the Terminator movies.
- Magical jumping, flying, spinning, marital arts moves ala the Matrix.
- Spiderman style swinging through downtown Hollywood on a string of christmas lights.
The other fun element to this movie is the soundtrack and its music video-like application.

1474154,1,B00005JLYW,"I rarely post one-star reviews here,but this movie,and common morality,demands an attempt to save others from the spirit-crushing,mind-numbing experience of watching this movie. The record number amount of overhype and commericals that preceded the film's release should have been a giveaway. They weren't expecting us to stay long enough to see all of the product placements. OK,where to start...bad writing,bad script,bad directing,bad acting,lousy special effects,zero suspension of disbelief,replacement WITHOUT EXPLANATION of one of the main characters... OK,here's a few things you should consider before spending money on this awful piece of cinema. I'll attempt not to spoil any ""suprises"" that may be in store for anyone: 1)Bosley,played by Bill Murray in the first movie,is replaced without ANY explanation by,get this,his black brother.(!)Turns out Bill(Bosley)was adopted and raised in the ghetto,though he apparently cleaned up his diction quite admirably. 2)Sample of the sly,witty humor that permeates the film:One of the Angels is found to have a previous name:Helen Zass. Get it?Haha! Loads of fun are had by all with this nugget of hilarity. 3)In spite of heroic efforts by the director's to expose the Angels in every possible way,the girls look sickly and anorexic. CA2:FT is the least sexy T&A movie I have ever seen. 4)The Angels and myriad evil villans have inexplicably acquired super Matrix-like powers. 5)I would like to tell the director,whose name appers seven times that I counted(""McG"",I got it),that just because the computers will allow you to achieve some special effect,doesn't mean you SHOULD achieve it. 6)Charaters in this walk through blazing infernos without a scratch,fall and/or jump from heights of over 200 feet and land on the ground perfectly,produce lifelike disguises from nowhere(unless stored in those skimpy outfits),etc. This  movie makes recent 007 flicks look like models for hyper-realistic film-making. 7)In what can only be described as stupendous failure,Mr. McG fails to utilize even a tiny fraction of the talents of some of the best comic actors of our time. You've have been warned. They're not funny,which is irritating,because they SHOULD be. 8)The movie is crammed with pointless cameos from a variety of pop music stars,actors and actresses. These are largely boring and would have been edited out if Hollywood had any sanity left. 9)By the end, I was feeling embarrased for the three big actresses(Cameron Diaz,Lucy Liu,Drew Barrymore),and I got the sense that most of the audience was as well. They strip,perform in a soapy car-wash scene,simulate many lesbian sex acts, and make complete Zasses out of themselves. I suspect that this will be a major career-damaging move for the three actresses. CONCLUSION:If you love the Charlie's Angels franchise,AVOID this film!

Forget an intricate plot or anything that will set you to thinking too heavy----this film is about fun, hotties--both female and male, cool effects and lots of laughs.

1474156,4,B00005JLYW,"If you saw the first Charlie's Angels movie then you know what to expect here. The truth is, Charlie's Angles: Full Throttle offers nothing that the first Charlie's Angels movie didn't. It follows our scantily-clad heroes through another outlandish big-budget adventure that takes them from Northern Mongolia to Hollywood and many places in between. But it is undeniably fun and a great action movie.
Don't try and make sense of the story; the suspension of disbelief required to follow this movie is astronomical, and the stunts and action sequences are beyond ridiculous, but if you're prepared to let go and immerse yourself in this audio-visual feast then you're guaranteed to have some fun.
Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore shine as the title characters, they offer good performances without ever taking themselves too seriously, much like the movie itself. Demi Moore plays Madison Lee, the movie's villain, who was once a Charlie's Angel herself before she decided to quit and work for herself. Her performance is disappointing; whenever she's on screen there's a sense of ""look at me, I'm making a comeback"", but her role is shallow anyway so it isn't all her fault. Justin Theroux gives a delicious performance as an Irish mobster, and it's nice to see that Robert Patrick, who has fun with his double-crossing role, is getting noticed by Hollywood.
There are lots of celebrity cameo roles to be found in this movie, most of which work well, such as Bruce Willis, and a couple which fall flat, such as pop star Pink. I was pleasantly surprised to see comic legend John Cleese playing Lucy Liu's father, although sadly he is given little room for any comedy and is present only as a novelty. Bernie Mac is hilarious as Bosley, the girls' link with the mysterious millionaire Charlie.
This sequel has a more complex plot structure than its predecessor, which serves it well. It also tries to add some emotional depth by taking Drew Barrymore's character on a difficult personal journey, but whenever it does this the movie falls flat and feels totally forced, such as when Drew trudges alone into a Mexican bar for no apparent reason other than to show one of the original Charlie's Angels TV show actresses (and I'll leave you guessing which one) in a silly cameo role, by far the movie's weakest moment.
Even though it's basically the same as the first film, it's very hard not to like this film. A brainless summer blockbuster to be sure, but well worth seeing. You'll definitely get your $7.50's worth of entertainment.",1056758400,,2539,4.893271461716937

But if you are looking for an action movie that doesn't take it self too seriously with a good dose of comedy thrown in, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is the ultimate tongue in cheek, campy, action flick. Everything about the first film is basically just increased a level for this film. In other words, if you enjoyed the first film, you should love this film. It's the perfect sequel that doesn't try to mess with the formula. In fact, it's almost the exact same formula, just with better action scenes and bigger special effects. This can sometimes be a bad idea as people who really didn't like the first film, should dislike this one as well.
I find myself having difficulty reviewing this film because of it's nature. Things in this movie that would be critiques of other films are part of this movie's charm. It's not the best movie ever. It's not even the best movie of the year. But for what it is, it's extremely entertaining.

1474281,3,B00005JLYW,"Rude and Crude, Loud and Crass on the outside but gooey as a Marshmallow on the inside, ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" comes screeching onto a million screens this weekend. And Drew Barrymore, Lisa Lui and Cameron Diaz seem to be having loads of fun karate chopping a couple dozen men and one woman: the commandingly sexy Demi Moore, a former Angel gone bad.
The Women are beautiful as are the men, the action is feverish and Bernie Mac as the new Bosley is a hoot. And it all adds up to a fun, though empty-headed time.",1056672000,,523,4.458333333333333
1474282,5,B00005JLYW,"For anyone who loved the first movie, this is hands down a must see.  Cameron, Lucy, and Drew all seriously rock as the angels.  While the first movie was a modest action film with a witty sense of humor, Full Throttle goes all out with big action scenes, more jokes, and more skin.  (And of course, more Moore.)
The movie parades around from one action sequence, to one musical sequence, to a comedy sequence, doubles up and goes through it all over again.  A lot of action movies these days seem really hollow and mass market produced for a dime a dozen, but through McG's direction and the hot stars, Full Throttle never lets up and never feels old or tired.
Some of the scenes I really liked were the opening rescue (which had a lot of action, plus a lot of laughs), the high powered motor cycle race, and the over-the-top pussycat strip dance!
I have to admit, Bearnie Mac was a pretty good Bosley, but I liked Bill Murry better in the role.  However, one newcomer I liked a lot more was Ms. Moore.  Demi rocked the house in this movie!  She's the baddest and hottest angel you could image, and I loved seeing her on the screen.
I'm not sure if the angels will come back yet again.  If McG and the girls can pull it off, I'd love it.  But, I'm thinking the franchise might run out of steam if a third film is made.  But, we'll see.
Overall, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is like a big party you'll have a blast at for 2 hours.  My advice: have fun!",1056672000,6,1454,4.2700729927007295
