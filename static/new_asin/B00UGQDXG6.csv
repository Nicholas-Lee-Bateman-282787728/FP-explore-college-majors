8706648,3,B00UGQDXG6,"Warner Archive has released the 1929 and 1937 versions of the classic tear-jerker ""Madame X"" as a two DVD set. I only purchased it as a big fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-William/dp/0786448784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren William</a>, who stars in the 1937 version, to add to my collection. The story, from a 1908 play by Alexandre Bisson, has been filmed NINE times so far, in 1916, 1920, 1929, 1937, 1948, 1952, 1954, 1966 and 1981! (WARNING! there are many spoilers ahead) The plot concerns a woman who left her husband and young child for another man. She attempts a reconciliation when she learns the child is ill, but the cold-hearted cuckolded husband will not forgive her. She begins a downhill spiral of alcohol, drugs, and prostitution, eventually becoming the mistress of a criminal. When the criminal threatens expose her secret she kills him, and being destitute she's assigned a lawyer who turns out to be her now grown son. Recognizing him she refuses to divulge any personal information, hence ""Madame X."" While testifying, her husband arrives to support their son and recognizes her, but she's able to stop him from divulging her identity, eventually dying in her son's arms. Whew! In true movie fashion, both films play loose with the original plot. Here's the breakdown......

The 1929 version stars Ruth Chatterton in the lead, one of MGM's first female stars. Chatterton was a respected stage actress, signed at the dawn of ""talking pictures"" when the movie studios were raiding Broadway to sign actors with experience in actually talking while they are acting.  During the early 1930's she became one of MGM's leading stars. Most of her famous pictures were filmed before the Production Code that sanitized movies for almost three decades went into effect. These ""Pre-Code"" films were able to be frank about topics such as premarital sex, adultery, addiction, abortion, and so forth in a realistic manner. Chatterton, whose last film was made in 1938 is mostly forgotten today, but viewing her performance in ""Madame X"" it's easy to see why see was so popular with female movie audiences. Although her line readings can be a little too ""stagey,"" her gradual transformation from a beautiful young mother to a broken old woman whose life of depravity shows in every line on her face attests to her estimable talent. The print is in fairly rough shape, especially the soundtrack which is very hissy and needs the volume raised to understand the dialog. The director was also a famous presence on the stage scooped up by MGM due to his experience with dialog, Lionel Barrymore. Although hired by MGM for his talent behind the scenes, Barrymore was soon to become one of the studios most beloved (and profitable) stars.  The film's lack of a musical score was intentional, Barrymore didn't want the actor's emotions compromised, using the silences for impact. He also was one of the first to use a microphone on a ""boom"" (in this case a fishing rod!) that followed the actors overhead so they could move around naturally. Before this, microphones were either stationary over the actors or hidden in the set's decor. Both Chatterton and Barrymore were nominated for Academy Awards, in Oscar's second year, losing Best Actress to Mary Pickford for ""Coquette"" and Best Director to Frank Lloyd for ""The Divine Lady."" With Lewis Stone (GRAND HOTEL, THREE GODFATHERS (1936), The ANDY HARDY Series) as the hardhearted husband, Raymond Hackett (THE SEA WOLF) as their son, and Sidney Toler (The CHARLIE CHAN Series) as her victim, the movie may seem creaky by today's standards, but the ending courtroom scene, especially Hackett's impassioned plea for her acquittal, is still quite powerful today. I would also challenge anyone to not be moved by their brief reunion at the end, dated maybe, but still powerful stuff......(3 stars)

What sinks this version is the Production Code. Where the 1929 version spoke of her adultery in no uncertain terms and showed her participation (and enjoyment) in her own depravity, here it's mostly implied. The censorship starts from the beginning, the wife is shown breaking off the relationship with her lover, who soon after is murdered by HIS wife, throwing our heroine into scandal, with both now conveniently punished for their sins. Her punishment has just begun, however, their son becomes seriously ill (the doctor is played by George Zucco) and the husband throws her out. In the earlier film she falls into a life of depravity, here she gets a job as a governess and falls in love with another man. It's only when she finds out he's married that her downward spiral begins. The plot follows the same trajectory as the earlier film, but is tame in comparison, and her decision to disappear when her husband remits just doesn't ring true here. Things almost look like they're going to pick up when she gets involved with a cardsharp played by the requisitely oily Henry Daniell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JANE-EYRE/dp/B000MGBLHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JANE EYRE</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BODY-SNATCHER/dp/B003GAJL9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BODY SNATCHER</a>), but their relationship goes by too quick. Unlike the first film, where she blurts out her secret while drunk later into her affair, she blurts it out soon after meeting him. At least from here on George finally looks the part of a destroyed woman. Everything seems condensed when compared to the earlier picture, which ran 95 minutes compared to this brisk 72 minute remake. Both films also excise the role of the mother-in-law, who serves as an important plot hinge in the original play. The role was reinstated in the popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1966-remake-with-Lana-Turner/dp/B000XT1P48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1966 remake with Lana Turner</a>. As for the all-important finale and denouement, George and Beal do a decent job, but I have to give the nod to the earlier version. Hackett's impassioned plea in her defense runs rings around Beal's. Either way, unless you're made of stone, tears will fall......(2 stars)

Unlike the the 1929 film, this retread has music, Gladys George even gets to sing a (torch) song. Warren's role, although second billed, is mostly limited to the first and last fifteen minutes, if that. This was his second of four films made under contract to MGM, beginning with the Jeanette McDonald vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FIREFLY/dp/B009JZTM5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FIREFLY</a>&nbsp;and ending with his best for the studio,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ARSENE-LUPIN-RETURNS/dp/B00KB49ME0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ARSENE LUPIN RETURNS</a>. The print is much better than the early film, not surprising due to the battered condition of the former. A short trailer in decent shape is included as well. Both films come across as creaky and dated due to the extreme changes of moral acceptability since their inception. Now mostly curiosities for the film buff or fans of the stars, but if weepy melodrama is your thing, they're right up your valley of tears......",1459900800,,8189,5.942324003392706
