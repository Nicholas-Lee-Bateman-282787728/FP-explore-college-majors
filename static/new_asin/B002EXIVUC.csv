it is beautifully shot and the transfer is crisp and clean.  The lead actor is also a hottie for the 70s-80s So thats a plus.... Its a good movie for a rainy dark night.",1327017600,3,359,3.9722222222222223

8368476,5,B002EXIVUC,"This movie was made from  a virtually non-existent plot and without a reasonable budget. However, you can see why Riccardo Fredda is reputed to be one of the greatest horror film directors in Italy. Rarely have I seen a movie this nice to watch throughout, just because of the staging, lighting and settings. The restoration work looks incredibly nice on Blu-ray. The great minimalist piano score is also a plus. Good interviews and extras, even though Claudio Simonetti from Goblin or the Albanesi guy don't really have anything to do with the movie. A giallo  thriller ""premise,"" not a very plausible one,  made like an old gothic movie, with a very arthouse  directorial approach  and, at the same time, tons of nudity, gore, -not very well executed, but great in concept- and sleaziness, which is expected in this kind of movies.

8368479,5,B002EXIVUC,"this is one of the more deranged films to come foom the 1980's Italian horror film bonanza.  The giallo , or crime horror flick had faded away after 11 years at the top.  And 400 movies.  What were they to do? Well the Italians went horror big time and this lasted for ten years until the whole italian film industry basically collapsed for good. mainly.  But at this time they were churning out horror films and it was working for them.  This one features screen goddess anita stringbergs' last film , as she had had enough ,  and in this one she plays a guys mom who is near her age. SO , she probably said.  That's it , I am done. Which is a shame.  but by now she's 70 years old or near it. This film features witchcraft and incest , but like I said.  anitas fine and supposedly the character used witchcraft not to age. And she wants her son , who is her husband reincarnated to come back to her.  So it's a nice deranged moive on many levels.  It was like they were making a giallo about a murderer and then threw in horror.  In real giallos the murderers were not supernatural.  They were slasher films with style or not.  This was made in 1981 and giallos had only died in 1980. sooo.  The picture looks the best it's been since it was shown at theaters back in the early 80's.  we have good acting in this one but it's a horror film in the end . part of the great 80's italain horror fest that ended in 1992 or so.  As the whole Italian film industry bascially died and became a shadow of itself.  Here we have a horror film masked as a giallo.  sort of.",1454284800,3,1563,4.1158940397351
8368480,4,B002EXIVUC,"This was the last directorial effort by Riccardo Freda (who sometimes used the pseudonym ""Robert Hampton""), who had many of his horror films shown on TV in the 70's, including CALTIKI THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959), THE WITCH'S CURSE (1962) and THE HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK (1962) and also made such sexual horror films like TRAGIC CEREMONY (1973), which could never be shown on TV, not even today, without extensive cuts. The same could be said about this Italian/French co-production, which is a sexy mix of horror and giallo genres. If all the nudity and gory violence were to be edited from this film so it could be shown on non-pay cable stations, it would only be 30 minutes long. And a word of warning: Since this is the complete Italian version of the film (all the U.S. VHS releases were severely edited, but more on that later), the portions of the film that never made it into the English-dubbed versions of this film are shown in Italian with English subtitles. If you believe that ""Books are for readin' and films are for watchin'"" (and you probably poop in your Depends because you are too lazy to get off the couch to go to the bathroom), you may want to skip this rather involving and suspenseful film. The film opens with a quote from Hieronimus A. Steinback: ""For centuries philosophers and poets have searched the universe for evidence of the existence of the Devil. However, it would have sufficed to look for it at the bottom of their souls."" (Truer words have never been spoken, especially for this film.). We then see a woman being stripped topless in her apartment by an intruder dressed in black leather. He then throws her down on her bed, strips her naked and begins assaulting her, while choking her with his hands. It is then revealed that this was all a scene for a film that is being made, and the actor playing the intruder, Michael Stanford (Stefano Patrizi; ROME: ARMED TO THE TEETH - 1976), was getting a little too involved in his role and has to be pulled off actress Beryl (Laura Gemser; BLACK COBRA - 1976; and too many EMMANUELLE films to mention) by the film crew. Michael takes a big swig of J&B Scotch (a staple in Italian films) while the film's director, Hans Schwartz (Henri Garcin; SOMEONE BEHIND THE DOOR - 1971), congratulates him on a ""very effective scene"" and goes on to say ""It looked like you really wanted to murder her!"" (anything for a shot!). While at his home, Michael relaxes by playing guitar and singing a sappy love song (that doesn't match his lip movements), when a gust of wind blows open a window. This somehow give him the idea of looking at some old childhood photos, which triggers a flashback where a young Michael runs into his loving mother's arms in a beautiful backyard. For some reason, Michael hasn't talked to his mother in over 15 years, so he calls her and says that he and his girlfriend Deborah Jordan (Silvia Dionisio; TERROR EXPRESS - 1979) are coming to spend a few days with her at her country estate and he has invited three more friends to join them later. Michael has always had frequent flashbacks about him and his mother Glenda (Anita Strindberg; WHO SAW HER DIE? - 1972) and how, as a young boy, he stabbed his father (a famous orchestra conductor) to death when he saw him beating up his mother (he was found holding the bloody knife). Michael was committed to an institution as a child and has partial amnesia about the event, only remembering bits and pieces about it. When Michael and Deborah arrive at his mother's country estate, Glenda's longtime personal assistant (i.e. butler) Oliver (John Richardson; EYEBALL - 1975) stares at Michael and says his resemblance to the ""Maestro"" is uncanny. Michael swears he heard some music coming from the house when he pulled up, but Oliver says that no music has played in that house since the Maestro died. Oliver also tells Michael that his mother is very sick and not to tell her he told him (one of the first things Michael does when he meets his her!) and that the electricity is out because the wiring in the house is old and even a gust of wind knocks it out. Oliver gives Michael his father's old bedroom to sleep in, while he escorts Deborah to her bedroom, which is clear across the huge mansion. Deborah is ticked-off at Michael for introducing her to his mother as his secretary (there's a good reason for that) and it is apparent as soon as his mother locks eyes on Michael after such a long period of time, that she has incestual feelings for him (It could be because he looks like his father or his mother is just into incest). It could also be that Michael feels the same (It would be one reason whey he introduced Deborah as his secretary). Glenda also shows Michael a portrait of her father and how much he looks like him (In his head, Michael hears his father say, ""Michael, why did you do this to me?""). Is it no wonder Michael hasn't visited his mother for so many years? To prove his non-incestual masculinity, a totally nude Michael and Deborah make love on the couch. The next day, Michael's three other friends show up at the house: Director and avid photographer Hans (When Hans tries to take a photo of Oliver, he shields his face with his arms); Actress Beryl (who has still remained friends with Michael even after almost killing her on the movie set); and Assistant Director Shirley (Martine Brochard; THE VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS - 1973), who has brought her tiny pet dog with her. When Hans asks Oliver why he didn't want his picture taken, Beryl interjects and says, ""They say when you photograph someone, you take away a small part of his soul. It can make him very ill...or even kill him."" Beryl says her birthplace on the Island of Martinique believes in such customs (Which begs the question: Why did Beryl become a film actress?). A short time later, they all get into a discussion about the occult, where Glenda says that even if it is not real, if you believe in it strong enough, it can still kill you (This is one of the many scenes that is not in the English language version, yet it really is important to the story). When everyone goes to sleep Glenda and Hans have a private conversation on how Michael was sent to a mental institution after he killed his father and was surprised how such a ""gentle soul"" could commit such a heinous crime (Hans' mind goes back to when Michael was choking Beryl on the movie set just a few days ago). She begs Hans not to tell Michael what she just told him and he agrees (Believe me, all this long-windedness really is an important part of the plot). They also talk about reincarnation, which reveals a lot about Glenda and Hans' personalities. In a strange scene, we see and invisible person leaving wet footprints on the ground as it walks into Shirley's bedroom and she screams. Beryl sees a shadow holding a crossbow and Shirley denies to Beryl that she ever screamed. Beryl decides to take a bath and then the lights go out, someone wearing black gloves trying to drown her in the tub. Shirley's dog saves the day, barking at the intruder and chasing him away, saving Beryl from a certain death. Michael begins acting like his father and when Deborah notices a strange ritualistic icon in a painting, she has a strange dream (?) where a zombie-faced monk makes her go to the basement of the mansion (her breasts are always popping-out of her nightgown), but she finds a door that leads to outside which she thinks will be safe, but she runs directly into a giant spider web, complete with a HUGE black spider hanging from the web. She escapes, only to find herself attacked by bats in a windy tunnel. Next, she finds herself in the thick brush of the woods, where she loses the top half of her nightgown and scratches her upper torso and breasts while a bunch of human skulls above her bleed from their mouths and eyes sockets all over her. Finally, she is tied to the wall of the basement while a giant crucifix on the wall opposite her is burning. Classical music plays (Franz Liszt's ""From the Cradle to the Grave"") and a nun rips off all of Deborah's clothes, while snakes slither at her feet and a deformed nun makes her drink the blood of a chicken she just decapitated. Then the large spider approaches her and grabs her legs, only to discover that the huge spider has black hands for legs. And you thought Michael was having problems? (Be aware that most of this sequence also doesn't appear in the English language version of the film, but, it too, plays an important part of the plot). Michael take all his friends to his childhood ""private kingdom"": a beautiful river with a really nice waterfall, where everyone discuss with each other all the strange things they dreamed or happened the night before. It's not long before most of these people will never make it out of the estate alive. Michael tells everyone he was in a trance last night, something his overpriced psychiatrist calls ""disassociation"" and ""psychosomatic"". Hans mentions he saw Oliver walking around in a trance last night and Michael says that ever since he was a child, he saw Oliver sleepwalking all the time, and admits to everyone that he did kill his father for beating up his mother. Michael cheats on Deborah and makes love to Beryl on the banks of the river, but when he wakes up, he discovers Beryl dead, her torso cut from her breasts down to her nether regions and Michael is holding the bloody knife (just like when he killed his father). Hans, who we learn saw the whole thing happen, writes a note saying that he is going to the police, but as he is walking through his bedroom door, someone splits his skull in two with an axe and splatters his brains all over the place. The bloody black-gloved killer then destroys the note and drives Hans' car off to make it look as if Hans is leaving by himself. As Shirley sees Hans' car drive away, she notices that he has left his precious camera behind, something that Hans would never do if he were leaving. She begins to develop the negatives and notices something interesting on one of them, but before she can tell anyone, she has her head nearly cut off with a chainsaw (the same chainsaw we saw Oliver using to make logs for the fireplace), while Deborah notices black leather gloves in Glenda's bedroom. When Oliver serves dinner, only Glenda and Deborah attend and Deborah notices that Glenda is wearing the same ritualistic icon around her neck that triggered her nightmare earlier. Or was it a nightmare at all? I'll never tell. I'll leave it up to you to discover who the killer is (the clues are in this review and, no. it's not Shirley's dog!). Like most giallo films, nearly everyone is hiding a secret from their past that they are trying to keep hidden. I will tell you this because you probably already guessed it: Michael did not kill his father. He was an easy patsy to blame since he was so young. It looks like years of psychotherapy have done him more harm than good. A tape recording left behind explains it all, but there's an unexpected supernatural angle at the finale tied to Deborah's dreams which make the killings all the more sinister. That's all I'll say, except if you are expecting a happy ending, you will be bitterly disappointed.  Director Riccardo Freda (who passed away in 1999 at the age of 90) keeps you guessing from beginning to end. When you think you have it all figured out, the screenplay, by Freda, Antonio Cesare Corti (CITY OF THE WAKLING DEAD - 1980) and Fabio Piccione (QUEEN KONG - 1976), gives you another piece of information which tosses your ideas into the garbage. While there are extreme bits of gore (some of the effects are done by Italian effects master Sergio Stivaletti, this being his first film), the film doesn't dwell on them. It's basically hit and run, which is best displayed in Hans' death by axe, It's just a quick hit, some brain matter flying in the air and on to the next scene. If it plays for more than two seconds, you are lucky. Too bad we can't say the same thing about the giant spider. It is shown way too long and looks as realistic as a Sharknado. The film (made under the title FOLLIA OMICIDA) was originally released on VHS in the U.S. by Wizard Video under the title FEAR, missing over ten minutes of footage. The British VHS tapes, released under the titles THE WAILING and SATAN'S ALTAR, are missing nearly twenty minutes of footage. Thankfully, Raro Video has released the fully uncut 95 minute version on DVD, so you won't be left scratching your heads wondering what the hell is going on in the abridged versions. The pristine widescreen DVD also contains some cut scenes and an interview with Sergio Stivaletti. If you want to watch this film the way it was originally meant to be seen, go for the DVD.

8368481,2,B002EXIVUC,"Stefano Patrizi plays an actor of little merit who almost loses himself while filming a scene where he is called upon to pretend to strangle an actress/character (but doesn't have the sense to know when to stop).  That no one on that set thought anything about this is a great indication of the prevailing cynicism seen throughout this sordid tale of deception, betrayal, madness, and murder.  After said incident, the actor gets the bright idea to visit his obnoxious mother with his girlfriend in tow.  He introduces her as his secretary and proceeds to treat her in an indifferent manner befitting a creep.  Later, the actress he almost strangled to death shows up with their director and another woman.  Nothing happens........nothing happens..........nothing happens...........wait for it.......finally, the creep actor has sex with the actress he almost killed.  He wakes up to find her dead.  The director took photos of the incident so he had to be killed, and so on until the final BIG reveal, which wasn't a shock or a surprise (a bit of a letdown actually).  The main problem with this lackluster effort is that every member of the cast plays a character with no quotient of sympathy, they are all uniformly unlikable.  It doesn't really matter what happens to any of them because they're either unsavory, crazy, snotty, or snooty.  And because it was already a senseless plot as is, they also thought to throw in a bit of the occult while they were at it.  Heavy on style, lax on substance, this film ends up an exercise in futility.  There's a perfectly good reason why this film was lost to obscurity, it deserves to be forgotten.

Filled with nudity and killings that are the stock of the trade, there's really nothing unique about this movie.  It's loud, garish, melodramatic, bombastic, and slightly overdone.  I can't think of one reason to keep it.",1433548800,,1867,4.882539682539683
8368482,5,B002EXIVUC,"""Murder Obsession"" (AKA: ""Follia Omicida,"" ""Murder Syndrone"", etc.) was directed by Riccardo Freda and is attributed as his last directorial effort, although he lived nearly another twenty years and gave his ideas to further films (He died in 1999).  He was born in 1909 making him about seventy when he directed ""Murder Obsession"" (1980) and previously he directed some well known horror films in the sixties starring Barbara Steele like ""The Terrible Dr. Hitchcock"" and ""The Spectre"" (AKA:  ""The Ghost"") and numerous sword and sandal epics, etc. and in 1957 is credited with directing Italy's first horror film, ""I Vampiri.""  ""Murder Obsession"" (especially the Blu-ray edition) is very beautiful at times with exquisite cinematography by Cristiano Pogany and equally extraordinary music by Franco Mannino which beautifully complements the images Freda envisions with the help of screenwriter Antonio Cesare Corti.  There are times when one wonders if Freda really is the maestro who can pull off making a success of the picture as elements of the picture like dream sequences feature many props, set pieces and familiar but off-putting gothic touches like the devoted but suspicious and eerie butler (played by John Richardson, who not even twenty years before had the leading roles in such pictures like Hammer's ""She"" opposite Ursula Andress (1965), or the setting of an eerie mansion and the giant rubber spiders and fake webs just out of a Roger Corman Poe quickie from the early sixties.  Also in the very able cast are Anita Strindberg (so good in Sergio Martino's giallo ""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key""), Stefano Patrizi, Silvia Dionisio and Laura Gemser among others.  Riccardo Freda also brought a lot of style to his pictures and beauty of the live flowers in many scenes, the playing of the classical music and the composition of images to depict great art and the fact that Freda and his co-workers bring all of these elements into near mastery.  The very fine Blu-ray from Raro Video has the Italian version with removable subtitles and also a shorter English language version, cut scene footage, interviews including with S. Stivaletti and Claudio Simonetti and a booklet containing critical analysis.  Having directed a number of video productions, I know how hard it is to keep a film from sinking with a low budget, this film ends up brilliantly on the final page, eliciting true terror in the viewer.",1388534400,3,2441,5.054726368159204
8368483,2,B002EXIVUC,"The two stars are rather a rating of the DVD than the film itself.

8368484,5,B002EXIVUC,"Raro Video has given Euro Horror fans an important release Directed by an icon of Italian cinema, Riccardo Freda.  The film is known under so many titles that you need a scorecard: The Raro release is 'MURDER OBSESSION' aka 'FOLLIA OMICIDA'-1981 and the other titles in case you have already viewed them are 'DELIRIA', L'OSSESSIONE CHE UCCIDE', 'UNCONSCIOUS' , 'SATAN'S ALTAR', 'THE WAILING', 'FEAR', and 'MURDER SYNDROME'.  Coming back from a sabbatical off an interesting failure from 9 years previous 'TRAGIC CEREMONY', this film blends all of Freda's visual styles from his early works with his then assistant Mario Bava and actress Barbara Steele fusing them into what I think is his best film.  Working from a script co- written by Fabio Piccioni and Antonio Cesare Corti , he surpasses the usual slice and dice murder format and creates a compelling nightmare culminating into a down beat ending which will take you by surprise no matter how many thrillers you've seen.  It has a first rate cast including genre stalwarts John Richardson who worked with Bava and Director Sergio Martino, Black Emmanuelle herself Laura Gemser, and the beautiful underrated Anita Strindberg who also worked with Director Martino and turns in one of her best performances as the mother of our main character played by Stefano Patrizi.  Utilizing hallucinogenic flashbacks and dream sequences enhanced by the beautiful camera work of Cristiano Pogany and musical motifs blending Franz Lizst and Johann Sebastian Bach with an original score by Franco Mannino , the film emerges as part Giallo/ part supernatural but never crossing the line in overwhelming the audience.  Raro Video releases it in a gorgeous 1.85 transfer in English and although there is a Blu-Ray release, it looks just as good. It also has added scenes which they discovered but unfortunately are in Italian with English subtitles.  Extras include a booklet with notes on the film and a bio/filmography on Freda and a great 15 minute interview with Director /Special Effects man Sergio Stivaletti who explains how he got started with Director Dario Argento and worked with Angelo Mattei in creating the effects for this film under Freda's utter annoyance with him.  Recommended for fans of Italian Horror, it emerges as Freda's most accomplished work and shows the importance of this great artist in the annals of cinema. Sadly, it would be his last film until working behind the scenes in 1987 as a second unit director for Bertrand Tavernier's 'LA PASSION BEATRICE'. He died in 1999 leaving behind a legacy of messages showing the many distortions which encompass the human mind.",1347926400,,2636,5.113953488372093
8368485,5,B002EXIVUC,"""For centuries, theologians, philosophers, and poets have delved into the universe in search of proof of the existence of the devil. It would have sufficed to look into the depths of their own souls."" This is some fascinating statement, don't you think? But, I suspect it is not taken from the classic ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" Rather, these are the words of Hieronimus A. Steinback, during the XVII Century, and they are precisely the ones used to open the enormously engrossing ""Murder Obsession,"" an erotic, murder thriller that will keep you glued to your seat until the final credits.

Once we read the aforementioned quote, the film goes to a dramatic scene, in which a killer proceeds to strangle his lady victim. The scene is intense, as the assassin tries really hard to kill the woman. For our surprise, we suddenly hear, ""Cut!"", and realize that is was only a movie. However, Michael's (the actor, played by Stefano Patrizi) behavior worries his coworkers. Michael then decides to take a break from filming, and plans a trip to visit Glenda, his mother (Anita Strindberg), who lives at the countryside. He takes Deborah, his girlfriend (Silvia Dionisio); Hans Schwartz (Henri Garcin), the director; Shirley (Martine Brochard), the director's assistant; and Beryl (Laura Gemser - yes, ""Black Emmanuelle's"" Laura Gemser). Once there, they not only meet Michael's mother, but also Oliver (John Richardson), the scary butler. Right from the start, too, we discover that Michael's relationship with his mother is quite strange, yet strong - with an incestuous feel to it --, and that Michael killed his father when he was a child. And, you guessed right, the killings begin again, and it is your job to figure out who is doing it.

""Murder Obsession"" (also called ""Murder Syndrome), which Italian name is ""Follia Omicida,"" was director Riccardo Freda's last film. It is said that is was Freda who made the first horror Italian thriller (""I Vampiri"" - The Devil's Commandment, 1956), so ""Murder Obsession"" was quite the movie to close his long career. The film is colorful, with many twists and turns, and with plenty nudity, especially from, yes, your guessed again, Miss Gemser. Good stuff, believe me. I wonder what she is doing these days. By the way, while researching Hieronimus A. Steinback, I found out that his quote has also been used in other films. The Blu-ray edition includes a documented booklet about the film and the director, deleted scenes, interviews with some Italian composers and directors, and more.
