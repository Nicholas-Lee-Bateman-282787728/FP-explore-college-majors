What Bruce Bennett has done in about 90 minutes is capture what's best about David's approach to 'the creative'... what it is that moves him, how he learns, how he addresses the challenges, and why he's a continuing source of great ideas and good feeling.

As I told both Bruce and David, the best thing about the film is that I found out a number of (important) things regarding David's view on his craft and his life that I'd not known.  And, at the same time, I came away with the same feeling of satisfaction, pleasure, irritation and enjoyment I have after spending a pleasant Saturday evening with David talking about ... pretty much anything.",1260057600,,837,4.597315436241611
8518309,5,B002X78QEA,"Fans of Mr. Hoffman's work will enjoy this in-depth documentary that takes an intimate look into his life, work and creative approach.

As a creative professional myself, I was able to appreciate Mr. Hoffman's stories and insights into the TV and film industries.  He offers worthwhile advice to others as he explains his history and accomplishments as a filmmaker.  Both young professionals and veterans in the media industry will be able to relate to Mr. Hoffman's struggles and achievements since he talks about them on such a personal level.

I was engaged throughout most of the film, especially when Mr. Hoffman took the camera crew into a room where he keeps his personal belongings that survived a fire.  This is where he really opens up and gives the viewers a sense of who he is and his appreciation for history.

I would recommend this film to any creative person, especially aspiring and veteran filmmakers.",1258848000,,919,4.935064935064935
