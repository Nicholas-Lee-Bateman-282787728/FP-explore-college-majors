2553167,5,B000F6IHRM,"I never, ever believed anyone would release this movie on DVD.  Having seen it in a film class and hoping I'd maybe find a run-down VHS copy to have if I could ever get around to it, I was very, very surprised to go into work today and see it sitting so happily in the new arrivals section.  I bought it immediately, before I even clocked on.

I can't comment on the quality of the disc quite yet, as I haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet, but the wonderful thing about this movie is that a bad transfer, although still a nuisance, can kind of add to its griminess.  This movie is very documentary-esque in the sense that it looks like its shot on film taped together from single frames, early neo-realism style.  Except what sets this film apart from the type of films that look like they were shot on somebody's parents' videocamera is that it's really well written, and the grime fits the tone.

It is ten years after the ""Second American Revolution,"" and the leader of the Women's Army mysteriously dies... setting off women across the nation to take down The System.  Honestly, this movie makes one think that they must have missed something while sleeping through classes.... ""Second American Revolution?  When did that happen?""  It's plausible enough.

A few images might seem dated, but I think they only increase the symbolic effect.  Stuff like the World Trade Center...  very powerful symbol today.  And the way the film analyzes the media and its use is very important to.  On many fronts, in many ways, and in many senses this is a brilliant movie, one that just gets better the longer one takes to sit back and think, ""Huh, crazy, that makes a lot of sense.""  Above all, it's visionary, pointing out the problems with feminism itself as well as promoting it.

The film also highlights most of the threads of feminist thought going on during the 60's-70's and contrasts them nicely through the main character's discussions.

2553169,4,B000F6IHRM,"It's the tenth anniversary of a Socialist being elected President of the United States...and very little has changed for women. Granted that great strides have been made for equality and social justice, but the economy has suffered and much of the great changes have been mostly talk. Women are still the last ones hired and the first ones fired. Two groups of activist women (or should that be ""womyn""?) decide to take their rage to the streets, voicing their opinions on two pirate radio stations; Radio Regazza (led by a white lesbian radical) and Phoenix Radio (led by a soft-spoken black woman). Granted the technical qualities of this film betray very small budget, but it is made with spirit, drive and passion. I've seen Hollywood films with one hundred times the budget that weren't this good, nor that packed a message as powerful. (Also, don't be confused by the director's name. From what I know, she has no relation to the axe murder.)",998611200,20,948,4.822085889570552

8117941,2,B000F6IHRM,"The only value of this film is the premise that electing a socialist government won't create significant social change and may simply dampen any revolutionary fervor.

Beyond that, it was a celebration of radical feminist misandry and violence - the social qualities that the ""revolutionary"" lesbian militants purport to want to transcend while themselves descending into the worst of human nature.",1416441600,3,398,5.524590163934426

8117943,5,B000F6IHRM,"This is a very radical political film. As a black lesbian feminist, I could relate to the premise of this film. The plot unfolds in a semi-documentary style, making this film all the more interesting. Set against the gritty backdrop of NYC, the film has a distinctly apocalyptic feel to it. This movie harks back to the militant, left-wing revolutionary fervor, of the 60s and early 70s.

Despite the changes in society resulting from feminism, gay rights, and the civil rights movement in the last 40 years, this movie shows that there's still much work to be done, to achieve real equality for all. It's not surprising to me that the radical political movement in the film, is led by a working-class black lesbian. Women who happen to be lesbian, blue-collar, and of color, are still the most oppressed people in our society.

Jean Satterfield is superb as Adelaide Norris, the dedicated member of the Women's Army. Jean conveys the militant stance of Adelaide, in a very visceral way. The supporting cast of this film, was also compelling. Especially Honey as Honey, the feminist revolutionary radio DJ. The film was slow-moving at times, but packed an emotional punch.

Rights of the oppressed in society, have been rolled-back by right-wing conservatives for the past 28 years. So, we could use a radical political strategy that addresses the rights of the oppressed again, like we did in the 60s and 70s. History has been known to repeat itself. In this day and age, a radical uprising by women in pursuit of equality, is needed more than ever. This movie could very well be a sign of things to come, in that regard. I recommend this film, to all who take women's rights seriously, and want to become more aware of women's oppression in society.",1261872000,9,1751,4.791390728476821
8117944,3,B000F6IHRM,"I will totally cop to buying this movie soley because it was highly recommended by Kathleen Hanna (love). Needless to say once I had this dvd in my dirty little hands I was pretty stoked to give it a shot. Now, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film so I guess I shouldn't have been suprised that by the time the credits started rolling I was in a state of utter confusion. What had just taken place? I mean sure I guess that I understood the general concept of the movie but why did I feel like I was missing something? Now, 4 months later I am still scratching my head. Sure, I appreciate the idea of a feminist force with the power to exact real social change(though I fear that this concept is merely a pipe dream) but I think I may be missing the point. Did this women make any real progress? What am I supposed to make of the ending, which felt so unfinished? Are any of these questions even relevant? I don't know. Maybe you do. This movie certainly made me think even though its lack of substantial answers frustrated me to no end. I do believe there is something to be gained from watching this film. Its certainly worth a shot.",1207440000,2,1149,4.251141552511416
