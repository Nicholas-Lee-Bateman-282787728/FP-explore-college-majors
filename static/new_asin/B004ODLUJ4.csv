4439460,5,B004ODLUJ4,Martin Short is the perfect actor for these wonderful Cat In The Hat videos. Short's voice brings so much goofiness to the character. Adults will enjoy this every bit as much as the children. I've been grabbing the new ones as soon as they come out. I pretend that I'm buying them for my 5 year old grandson but they're just as much for me. They are destined to become classics.,1325030400,2,378,4.338028169014085

It features fun Cat in the Hat fun, snowman, penguins and more!  As an adult I think its neat because Martin Short is the voice behind The Cat in the Hat, my boys just think he's silly.

2. Flight of the Penguin
3.  A Long Winter's Nap
4. Reindeer Games
45 minutes, Spanish language option
This can be played continuously through all 4 episodes. If you do however, there is advertisement between each episode. They are very educational. It teaches about cold weather, winter, hibernation, bears, penguins, cold weather birds, reindeer diets. It has catchy songs.  There is competition between characters in some of these episodes, that teaches about good sportsmanship, which was an unexpected bonus.",1399507200,,531,5.463414634146342

4439499,3,B004ODLUJ4,I ordered this movie as a gift for my 2 year old grandson. I'm really hoping the movie itself is not damaged because the box came with a small hole in it. It looks like a puncture from opening a large box of movies and the knife might have went too deep. I guess we'll find out on Christmas. I'm sure he'll love the movie if it will play.,1387152000,,338,3.9130434782608696

It contains 4 episodes--Snowman's Land, Flight of the Penguin, A Long Winter's Nap, and Reindeer Games.  Each is educational and FUN in Cat in the Hat style.  :)",1368403200,3,314,4.535714285714286
4439502,5,B004ODLUJ4,"My daughter Paige loves The Cat in the Hat and adores all animals so this was the perfect set for her! The Cat in the Hat: Safari So Good is a new DVD and book. She actually chose to read the book before watching the movie.

Sally and Nick go on a trip with the cat to Africa. They get to see all kinds of wild animals on their grand adventure. My daughter was naming all the animals and telling me she wanted each one as a pet! This prompted a discussion on the difference between wild animals and pets. I love how much my kids learn each time we read one of Dr. Seusss books. For some reason, the lessons stick more than they do with others. I think it has something to do with the rhyming found in his books.

The DVD is also about the safari adventure but obviously much more engaging! Paige loved all of the animals and hearing the different sounds they made and learning all about them. She particularly loved the part about footprints and we had a long talk about it. Now she shows me whenever she makes her own footprints. On a recent hike she also pointed out and named the animal footprints. (She guessed safari animals but I was still proud of her for noticing!)

Dr. Seuss has been around for so many generations because of his broad appeal to kids of all ages  and moms! Safari So Good is another winner for Dr. Seuss and is sure to be as beloved as all his other stories.",1362268800,,1385,4.195488721804511

8437166,4,B004ODLUJ4,We are Japanese learning English. My 3 year old daughter liked Cat in the Hat and she always sing along the song. If only it had English subtitles for non-native speakers like us.,1464480000,,179,4.454545454545454
8437167,1,B004ODLUJ4,"I ordered this around the holiday season, to surprise the kids. I usually like these videos, they are little more educational than some of the other things out there, and I find that some educational value is better than mind numbing crap. This particular video, is not worth the money. I have tried to watch it at least three times with the kids, and even they can't seem to understand what is going on. They seem to prefer the other ones, they own one about reptiles, one about outer space, and the human body. I would recommend getting any of those versions of Cat in the Hat, but this one is a waste of time and money.",1452729600,,622,4.3247863247863245
