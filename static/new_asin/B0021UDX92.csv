8349526,4,B0021UDX92,"This is a series of 4 lectures on ufos, crop circles, etc. My favorite was the 'star kids' one. Having watched Volume 1 I was ready to dig into this one and it delivered the goods.",1359676800,,180,4.027777777777778
8349527,3,B0021UDX92,"The description of the contents pretty much says it all.  This DVD is a compilation of lectures about UFOs from some of the top researchers on the subject.  If you're into UFOs and don't mind getting your information in a fairly dry lecture format, this DVD is must for you.  If you're new to the subject, you should check this out for avenues of further reading and viewing.  For me, Dr. Richard Boylan and Peter Khoury are both lecturers I'd like to hear more from.  This is not a slick presentation but a good quantity of raw material to chew on here.",1276214400,,554,4.392156862745098

Richard Boylan talks about ""Star Kids,"" Freddy Silva covers crop circles, Peter Khoury recounts his personal experience with a UFO, and it wraps with a lecture on Paranormal Aspects of UFO Phenomenon from Keith Basterfield.
