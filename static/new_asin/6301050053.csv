7810221,5,6301050053,"This is an amazingly great Hogan video.  It chronicles Hogan's feud with Andre the Giant in depth.  You will see the Piper's Pit interviews that lead up to the Hogan Andre match at WMIII as well as the contract signing.  This is Hogan at his best, this feud is what turned Hogan from just a great WWF champion to the undisputed top man in the history of the business.  A great addition to this video is the infamous match where Hogan loses the title after a 4 year reign to the Giant due to a referee that was payed off by the Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase.  This video is a must see for any Hulkamaniac as well as any wrestling fan in general.",1023580800,4,645,4.169354838709677
