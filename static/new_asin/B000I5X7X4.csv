8144043,3,B000I5X7X4,"Unlike Usual Suspects this dvd is much better. Better lit, much better and lively crowd, and more match variety.

Brian Kendrick vs. Roderick Strong - 8:10 3/5
MVP vs. Ryze - 6:27 2/5
Rainman vs. Sal Rinauro vs. Jared Steel vs. Kahagas
Dunn vs. Eddie Vegas 12:22 - 2/5
Jarelle Clark vs. Jimmy Rave 10:44 - 4/5
Carnage Crew/Marcos vs. Heartbreak Express/Don Juan - 14:09 - 5/5
Jamie Noble vs. Steve Madison 10:54 - 2/5
Homicide vs. CM Punk 16:12 - 5/5

Positives:
*MVP dominates!
*Dave Prazak's involvement in the Rave vs. Clark match
*The six man tag match is created because one team likes to eat potato chips, drink beer, and watch tv, can't find a more awesome way to create a 6-man tag than that lol
*Homicide rips off Hulk Hogan! you can't find more awesomeness than that

Negatives:
*Some promos are cut out (badly I might ad)
*It jumps from match to match to match without any breaks, obviously cut for time (The dvd is 1 hour, and 47 mins)

The constant cuts from match to match are a pain, but regardless it's a good FIP show",1338163200,,1034,4.426315789473684
8144044,3,B000I5X7X4,"Well the first few FIP events have not been very good. I am hoping to see something a bit more exciting. Today they had a ""full house"" 60 people maybe? The announcers are sub par as usual. It was a nice feature that you could actually hear the wrestlers when they cut a promo.

Spanky vs Roderick Strong- Ok match, not nearly as good as either of these guys could do, but much better then the average FIP match. It's nice to see a match where a hammer lock, and then a chin lock take up a majority of the match. Grade B-

Antonio Banks vs Ryze- Banks was not as smooth as he usually is. Ryze is really good if you like the Great Khali, he isn't as mobile or as big, and he doesn't speak English. WWE is chomping at the bit to sign him. Antonio Banks might have the worst finishing move ever. Grade C-

Sal Rinauro vs Jared Steel vs Rainman vs Kahagas- This match was slow paced and boring. Just when you think it will start going, someone is randomly eliminated. This match was not well paced, and nobody really stood out. Steel, Kahagas and Rinauro seem destined for jobber land (well they will push rinauro in other DVD's). Rainman seems like he might have some talent but never wins. Grade D

Fast Eddie vs Dunn- Vegas plays the heel roll very well. He just can not wrestler very well. Dunn had some decent skill but also never wins. Grade C-

Jerelle Clark vs Jimmy Rave- The first 10 minutes of the match is the classic one arm bar, one chin lock. If you didn't fall asleep during that, you got to see 2 good wrestlers go at it. Then we saw some nice high flying moves from Clark and Rave, leading to Clark finishing him off. Grade C+

The heartbreak Express + Don Juan vs Carnage Crew and Marcos- I like carnage crew they cut some interesting promos, and can put on a decent match. However tonight the promos stunk, the match was worse. Grade F

James Gibson vs Steve Madison- This was a nice match. Both men went all out and the action was fast paced. Some of the other wrestlers should take note of this. Some very hard hitting moves combined with some high spots made this very enjoyable. Grade B+

CM Punk vs Homicide- Another great match. This match was a street fight so they let both wrestlers really go at it. We saw a few weapons used bit overall what made this match great was the all out action we saw out of both competitors. Its easy to see a great match because the competitors throw themselves at each others and its all action. This is the type of match I want to see more of. Grade A-

Overall this was the best of the 5 FIP DVD's I have seen. It had a few good matches mixed in with the usual boring sub par matches. They need more talent, and a few more exciting matches. Grade B-",1190592000,,2705,4.206563706563706
8144045,5,B000I5X7X4,"Full Impact Pro made its debut in Arcadia to what I would guess was their biggest crowd to date. Coming off what I would call their worst show ever, they certainly hit a home run with this event. They started with a bang as two of the top independent wrestlers in the country put on a wrestling clinic in the opening match. Spanky vs Roderick Strong was perhaps the 2nd best match of the night behind the main event ( 8 / 10 ).

The second match pitted Dave Prazak's Asian giant Ryze taking on the rising star Antonio Banks. I still think Ryze is really green but has the potential to be something big in the wrestling business with the proper guidance. Antonio Banks continues to impress me and he is building momentum with each and every victory in an FIP ring ( 6 / 10 ).

The four-way fray was won by Salvatore Rinauro and involved Jared Steel, Rainman and Kahagas. The storyline here was that Sal Rinauro is the new ""protg"" of Spanky, who was at ringside cheering for his buddy ( 6 / 10 ).

Dave Prazak deprived the Arcadia fans of seeing a Tag Team championship match, but instead let his DP Associates compete in separate singles matches. First up, Fast Eddie Vegas defeated Dunn (from the Ring Crew Express) but it took interference from Jimmy Rave to score the victory ( 6.5 / 10 ). It was really fun to see Dunn, and later Marcos, wrestling outside of the spot fest ROH-style they have become known for. They are actually really good wrestlers as singles and as a team. Jerrelle Clark showed up to make the save and morphed into a match where he pinned Jimmy Rave in a 1-on-1 bout ( 7.5 / 10 ).

The Carnage Crew joined forces with Marcos (of the Ring Crew Express) for a six man tag team match against The Heartbreak Express & Don Juan. I have always hated the Carnage Crew, I still don't understand The Heartbreak Express, and Don Juan annoys me -- despite all that I have to admit it was a decent match ( 6 / 10 ).

In a grudge match stemming from an incident that happened the night before, the ""Modern Miracle"" Steve Madison finally showed some personality and challenged former WWE Superstar James Gibson. It was a heated affair with both men doing their best to destroy the other, but it was Steve Madison who had his hand raised at the end of the match. Scoring a victory over James Gibson is a huge feather in your cap, even if Madison had to wrap a steel chain around his fist and crack Gibson in the head to do it! ( 7.5 / 10 ).

The main event was an ""Anything Goes"" match between FIP Champion Homicide and C.M. Punk. Punk stole the FIP belt several months ago at an ROH show in New Jersey and has been claiming to be the FIP Champion ever since. Good prevailed over evil on this occasion as Homicide defeated Punk and reclaimed possession of the FIP belt. It was an incredible match and the crowd was emotionally invested into every intense moment ( 9 / 10 ).

Final Thoughts: I'm really happy to see attendance growing for FIP events. The crowd was really vocal during this show and there were a lot of kids there having the time of their lives. That's what wrestling is all about. Good on Full Impact Pro for putting out a quality family-friendly product.",1166227200,,3180,4.334453781512605
