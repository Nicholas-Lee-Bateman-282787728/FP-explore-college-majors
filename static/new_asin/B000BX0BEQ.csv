8093648,2,B000BX0BEQ,"Vulgar and disgusting dialogue from a certain portrayal of a french director.  Jiminy Glick is hilarious!  So is Jan Hooks.  However, this french director part is too frequently in each scene and he spoils the movie.",1526083200,,216,4.944444444444445
8093649,5,B000BX0BEQ,Jiminy Glick is hilarious and this DVD was too!  I enjoyed it thoroughly.,1432598400,,73,4.615384615384615
8093650,2,B000BX0BEQ,"I like Martin Short. I like everything about him. I think he's a great singer and entertainer, he's smart, he's lovable, and he's apparently very funny because he's always cracking up the cast and behind camera crew. He and his style appeal to me, and I just like him.

But this movie just isn't funny. And Glick isn't funny. Short tries to carry Glick with the same funny speech patterns that carried Ed Grimley... ""I'm as doomed as doomed could be, ya' know."" Grimley and Glick use similar speech patterns. But that's not enough to carry this character or this movie.

Short says in the DVD commentary that they improvised most scenes with no or very little script, though his commentary partner calls him on that and disagrees with him and insists there was a script. Now that's funny. But anyway, as the Beatles learned when filming ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" hoping that people will be naturally funny and interesting doesn't work. You have to put some hard work and long hours into a polished script to get anything worth shooting. This movie (if there really was no script) again affirms that truth.

This movie features a lot of vulgar material and I think that was a big mistake. The larger plot and story and comedy style would have appealed to young people and families and Short sacrificed that entire viewing audience for the coarse material and it really doesn't add anything. I guess Short felt an R rating was what was needed at this point in his career.

Very little in this movie works. The boyfriend/manager character was the only one that was funny, yes he was over the top but at least he was actually somewhat funny. Glick is best when Hollywood celebrity Short shows through the character while giving a good natured ribbing to Hollywood giants like Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, and Kurt Russel (Hanks does not appear in this movie but Glick has interviewed him elsewhere to great results). The interviews that Glick does with Martin and Russel, and especially the deleted outtake footage of those interviews are the only thing that works in this movie.

The production and story were much bigger than what I expected. The plot explanation at the end is pretty good, creative, outlandish, unexpected, and funny. There's a part that was scripted. The movie has good production values, but what it needed was a script that actually contained some jokes.",1264809600,,2367,4.791666666666667
8093651,5,B000BX0BEQ,"I first caught ""Primetime with Jiminy Glick"" on Comedy Central about a year or so back. It took me a few episodes to catch on, but Martin Short is amazing as this character. I suggest you start with ""Primetime"", but once you watch it, you'll love this movie. Written in old-fashioned Hollywood style, it is a strong storyline and cast of characters. Like most movies of its type, it doesnt take itself too seriously and is filled with hilarious laughs all the way to the end. It follows Jiminy's rise to fame through the Toronto film festival and a string of unbelievable events.

I have not seen a comedy this good in a long time!",1142812800,3,631,4.48695652173913
