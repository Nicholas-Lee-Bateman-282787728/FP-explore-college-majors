4538998,5,B0053O89U6,"This show is hilariously funny.  We couldn't stop watching.  We missed the first two seasons and caught up by buying the DVDs.  Our kids suggested the show to us.  I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a sitcom.  The family is just dysfunctional enough to funny, but not so much as to be condescending and they, in a comical way, broach a lot of controversial subjects.  We're going to watch them all again and we hardly ever watch reruns of TV shows until about 10 years time has gone by.",1321660800,22,494,4.315217391304348
4538999,5,B0053O89U6,"As I have come to expect, I had a good laugh while watching yet another hilarious Modern Family. The writers and actors are so talented, being able to pull off such humor week after week. Loved the start of Season 3, and am already counting down the hours until the next episode, I completely recommend this season for anyone who loves to smile! Buy this now!

4539000,5,B0053O89U6,"This show is so well written and acted that it is a real treat to watch it each week. This week all three families are their usual hilarious selves. Haley visits college with Phil and he goes predictably bonkers there.  Ty Burrell is totally hilarious in this episode as he is back on his home college turf with his Bulldog sweatshirt, barking everywhere he goes.  He is now my favorite character whereas when I started the series he was way in the back for me.  His wife Claire wants a night out with the gays, through her brother and Cam, so that she can safely let off some steam. Gloria and Jay think Manny is going through the full awakening to girls.  He is but in a way one would never expect. You can't miss with this show.  Buy the whole season.",1319241600,,754,4.28169014084507
4539001,5,B0053O89U6,"With a second Emmy under their belts for best comedy, with Phil and Clair both getting comedy Emmys, with most of the rest of the cast also nominated, what's not to like?  Without missing a beat, we opened with the first episode with the whole family at a dude ranch.  Then on the same night moved into this episode, which was life as usual back home.  Our favorite gay couple want to adopt a boy, their daughter Lily is against it, and everyone else erupts into their usual zaniness until the grand adoption announcement is made. This comes on the heels of Clair's getting store security footage to play for everyone (on Phil's back ending her into a pile of cans at the grocery store as he makes eyes at another pretty woman).

I just love this show. If you haven't seen it, you are missing the best comedy on tv.",1316822400,,815,4.377483443708609

4539116,1,B0053O89U6,"This has always been the worst of all the politically correct sitcoms on TV in this decade (and there's a lot of them). It's easily the most corrected of them all with the infinite deliberate PC statements they've been trying to shove down Americans' throats since the beginning. They pretend as if having a white family with an infantile pathetic father, an interracial family with an obese son, and the most random, a flamboyant homosexual couple adopting an Asian daughter immigrated from Vietnam all in the same blood-related family is a perfectly normal stereotype circa 2011. The problem is that I lived in multiple upper-middle class suburbs (which they all ironically seem to be) and have never seen a family as intentionally eclectic as this all living on the same block as one another. This isn't even an aggregate statistic in an inner city hair salon. It's just an attempt by the PC media to put these elements everywhere until everyone accepts it. Furthermore, the show just isn't funny. The writers and characters are afraid to be improper, irreverent, or think outside of their predictable politically correct limitations which ironically prevent the show from ever being the innovative, unprecedented humor that it's brainwashed fan-base pretended it was during its far too prolonged run on major network television. Unlike the liberal production team at ABC, any sane person should avoid this show and not add to its false credit of being ""very good"".",1500508800,,1468,5.070247933884297

I've watched Big bang theory, which is great if you like intelligent humor, and Parks and Rec, for those of you (like myself) who may enjoy that quirky/slapstick/absurd humor. The way I would describe Modern Family is that after every episode  I feel very entertained. It's not always ""piss your pants"" hilarious but I haven't came away from the an episode feeling like I wasted my time. Because there are so many different personalities on the show and you're bound to find a some

I bought season 3 because I needed something to do/watch on an 8hr flight home. Having Amazon instant video allows you to download your purchases on to approved devices, so I  bought season 3 and loaded it on to my ipod. I watched this about 3/4 of this season on my ipod for about 6 hrs straight, and it felt like the time ""flew"" literally.

I had been afraid that they had lost it by season three, while there were some highlights in the early episodes, a lot of the early shows just didn't seem as good as the previous two seasons.

Although there may be a dud episode (rare) or two weaker ones, I am still very much enjoying this show into the third season. This is a good investment because I know my family will re-watch the discs and make it worth the money to have it in-house. But the Blu-ray formatting and menu Drive Me Crazy--just like with previous seson! I don't know about the DVD, but the Blu-ray takes Forever (relatively) to load, even when its already in the player. I can usually just hit Play and my Blu-ray player will just power on start up where it left off, but with Modern Family, I can't tell for a couple of minutes if anything is happening, then I have to go back through the menu and maybe the FBI stuff again and...Arrrgh!

From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.

Season 3 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",1397520000,,760,4.770992366412214

I am a huge Disneyland fan and when I saw some promos for this episode I just had to see it. I don't usually buy TV episodes but I had this feeling it was going to be something I would watch again. :)

Since I'm not really familiar with the characters are storyline I didn't know what to expect. I thoroughly enjoyed the episode though. There were a lot of things in it that I could relate to. I've gone to Disneyland several times in my life and it was funny seeing things that I've personally gone through or seen while at Disneyland. I found it very funny and very easy to watch.

I recommend this to anyone who loves Disneyland. If you don't know the characters or haven't really seen the show (like me) it's still a great episode to watch for Disney fans.

4541800,5,B0053O89U6,I love this show. It was a great buy. Its got the whole season plus a bunch of bonus features that are super funny. My husband and I don't have cable so we don't get to catch these shows until they're on DVD and we have to spread the show out over a couple of weeks so that we don't spend ridiculous amounts of money on movies and series on DVD.

With a few rare exceptions, I enjoyed almost every episode of Seasons 1 and 2 and laughed out loud quite often.  Season 3 shows a few more weak areas.  The show, overall, is still highly entertaining, but I can tell things are not as ""fresh"" as before and they seem to be struggling to come up with new material.

Season 3 is still very good, but Seasons 1 and 2 set a very high bar for TV comedy.",1375228800,,639,4.291666666666667

I know it's very difficult to write comedy and this show started out so hilariously funny that subsequent seasons just haven't been able to live up to the bar the first (and second) season set. It's still worth watching. I hope it has just hit a temporary lull and will bounce back with some great episodes. This is a phenomenal show afterall.,1363305600,3,466,4.306818181818182

4542450,5,B0053O89U6,"I was introduced to this show after season 1 was on DVD a few years ago. I received season 1 as a birthday present and I have loved the show ever since. Season 3 was no different. The characters are still up to their hilarious shenanigans and evolving as the show continues. With all the Emmies and nominations this show is definitely one of the best on television and I hope it continues for quite a few more seasons.

I'm a bit of a weird-o and I don't like to watch television shows while they are being broadcast, I have a tendency to wait for the show to be released on DVD and then have a binge extravaganza. I enjoy this show so much I attempted to watch the first few episodes of this season on Hulu, but my crappy bandwidth didn't allow that to happen for long.

""Leap Day"" is by far my favorite episode of this season. It is Cameron's birthday and he is turning 10, or is he turning 40? Phil likes to do something awesome with the extra 24 hours he is presented with on Leap Day and this year the family is going to take trapeze lessons. But we are presented with a rather hilarious plot twist, all of the girls in the Dunphy house are getting their periods--many laugh out loud moments came from this.

""Disneyland"" is a humorous episode filled with poignant moments of the family that is reminiscing and creating new memories in this famous amusement park. I really enjoy the moment Jay has towards the end with his family, almost brought tears to my eyes.

My favorite family dynamic is Jay, Gloria and Manny. They have some of the most heart warming moments for me. This season is no different as Jay and Manny's relationship grows even more.

Phil and Cameron are definitely the funniest characters to me. They are both free spirited and kind people and the actors playing them are so animated and free in their portrayal of the characters.

This season has some great guest appearances my favorite being Leslie Mann as a woman Cameron picks up ""as a straight man"" and David Cross as a mouthy politician.

All in all this show is great. Season 3 did not disappoint at all. With a great cast and wonderful writing I can see this show continuing for quite some time. I can't wait to see what is happening in Season 4.

My boyfriend and I, on more than one occasion, have had to pause the DVD because we are laughing so hard! The actors all have great comedic timing and the writing is extremely clever but often irreverent and slightly 'racy' (as my parents would say), but I really think it plays to a very wide audience. Part of the 'cast' includes a gay male couple who live together with their adopted child, so if you're extremely conservative this might not be for you...that said, get a sense of humor (hah) because some of the most hilarious scenes involve the gay couple! I have recommended this show to a lot of people and they all love it...but then, they all have my highly sophisticated sense of humor (<--that was a joke...I really am very humble. Hah again.)

4542606,4,B0053O89U6,"Modern Family has come to be synonymous with high praise and award show dominance.  Season three proves that the hyperbole surrounding this hit-show are not chimerical and are, if anything, not strong enough.  The wonderful cast, led by Ed O'Neil, always finds a way to be utterly believable to the point that it's easy to think of the characters as actual people, not invented personalities for the sake of entertainment. Eric Stonestreet, who portrays Cameron, is especially noteworthy for his flawless performance in each episode. The writing, though, is what really makes the show outstanding.  A combination of touching, witty, and smart humour pervades each episode often pairing comedic antics with meaningful asides about family, the parent/child dynamic, etc.  The pairing of intelligent scripts and phenomenal acting easily makes Modern Family a show worth watching but also a show worth owning for viewing when new episodes aren't airing.  This is show is a classic in the making and may ultimately join the pantheon of iconic television shows against which all others are compared.",1354492800,,1093,5.294797687861272

It would be hard to pick a favorite but if I had to, it would be Phil who is so naive and loveable and the perfect husband for Claire who is a little nutty herself.

There are definitely some memorable episodes this season. Phil and Cam remain my favorite characters and my least favorite, Luke, seemed to noticably improve. However, I wouldn't say season 3 is on par with the previous two, and I'm not exactly sure why that is. Perhaps it's the change in the actress who plays Lilly, maybe it was due to Cam & Mitch and Phil & Claire getting into arguements practically every ep, or perhaps it's just that I enjoyed more eps in the prior seasons than this one; I don't know but there it is. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes good old-fashioned family television because there's something for everybody in it, especially if you've seen at least some of the show already but not yet S3. I can say that this is the season that 'stole the show' as it were with awards, and also why they all received a salary increase for season 4; I just hope they can keep up the quality.",1350259200,,1071,4.386934673366834

Thanks to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) for the Emmy Awards for the show in the best comedy category, and to a well deserved Julie Bowen.  I think she is very funny and so is her onscreen husband Ty Burrell and step mother Sophia Vergara. Currently this is one of the best sitcoms on television, and I am looking forward to enjoying the fourth season.

Jay is the patriach of the family and is remarried to a much younger sexy, saucy Colombian wife Gloria are raising her son Manny. Gloria is actually slightly younger than Jay's daughter Claire. Claire and Phil are a married couple with the ""traditional"" family - two daughters and a son. Claire's brother Mitchell lives with his gay partner Cam and their adopted Vietnamese daughter Lilly. Hence, we have the modern family - a blended mix of cultures and non-traditional families together as one big, loving family.
The show is incredibly well-written and the cast is a pure delight. They all live near to each other so the lives of parents and children and cousins constantly merge. Gloria with her feisty Latina temper and heavy accent brings a special love and joy to the family. Goofy Phil Dunphy is the kind of silly but loving father that we all wish we had had. Gloria's son Manny is the glue that binds everyone together. This 13 year old is wiser and more mature than any of the adults. The show does play on stereotypes at times--the fiery latina and the effeminate gay men, yet somehow it is all done in good fun and respectable good taste. There is no meanness to the humor. Just sit back and roar with the laughter. There is a particularly finally episode of the family spending the day at the Disneyland Resort. Don't miss this season!",1348444800,3,1686,4.642140468227424
4542901,5,B0053O89U6,"This was the first season I really started to watch Modern Family and I am glad that I did. Unfortunately it was about half of the way through the season. Thus, for me this was a great set to grab and to watch, not only because I missed half of the season, but because it was hilarious! Now that I went back and watched this season, I can see that I will be looking for the first two seasons either in my local library or in a local store or online as this series is great! The writing is funny, and the characters are so memorable! The Blu-ray has some great Bonus Features on it that bring you behind the scenes to really get to see some funny family interviews as well as gag reels (my favorite) among other things. If you are already a fan, this is a great set to have at home, if you are just watching for the first time, you can definitely jump right in and enjoy it and catch up with the past seasons in the time to come!",1347926400,5,928,4.021621621621621

4542978,5,B0053O89U6,"I have been a HUGE Modern Family fan since its beginning in 2009. It never fails to deliver gut-aching laughs on a weekly basis. All of the characters are relatable and are extremely well acted by a SUPERB cast. I have introduced dozens of people to this show and it is now many of my friends favorite. When introducing the show, I usually start off by saying a standout on the show is Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphey but then I also add that Eric Stonestreet is amazing as Cam. Then I must add that, oh, Julie Bowen plays a perfect crazy mom, Claire Dunphy and Sofia Vergara plays an amazingly extravagant and always hilarious Gloria. My friends usually end up saying ""So basically what you're saying is that the whole cast is amazing?"" And my answer is always yes. And that's what makes this show so perfect. I totally believe every single actor is the character they are portraying.

The other thing that makes this show the best show on television is the writing. The writing is what wins this show its Outstanding Comedy Emmy every year. The writing is smart, witty, outrageous and perfect. It enters about 10 episodes a year to the Emmy's for consideration in the Writing for a Comedy Series category and won its first two years. This year, the third year, it was snubbed in the category, most likely because there were split votes between separate MF episodes.

I can't explain how much this show means to me. Whenever I need to have my spirits lifted, I simply put in my Disc Two of Season Two and watch ""Caught in the Act"", my favorite episode and the episode that won Steve Levitan his second Emmy for Writing of a Comedy Series.

I believe EVERYONE should watch and enjoy this show as much as I do. Season 3 is exceptional and sure to take home the big Emmy once again. I can't wait for September because with it comes my birthday, the season 4 premiere of MF and the release of the Season 3 DVD! All always highlights in my September!",1343433600,5,1941,4.446629213483146
4542979,5,B0053O89U6,"The third season is the best yet! The characters continue to grow, and the comedy never gets stale. I look forward to the next season!",1342051200,,134,4.4
4542980,5,B0053O89U6,"i first learned about this series when it won the emmy for best sitcom in its first season.  it has been a big emmy winner ever since.  if you are new to this show, it involves an extended family living in LA and their adventures in coping with modern life.  it is laugh out loud funny.  the escapades they get into on a weekly basis are something that are so everyday but played for maximum hilarity. a big winner often cannot keep up quality from season to season but this show is the exception.  the third season is every bit as good as the first. when i first started out watching, the gay couple made up my favorite characters.  although i still like them a lot, that has now been eclipsed by the very solid performance by ty burrell as phil the realtor married to claire.  he won the emmy for his performance last year and fully deserved it. in the season closer to season three we got to see phil react to his daughter's announcement to she was going to live with her boyfriend in an apartment.  utter mayhem ensued!  i can't recommend this show highly enough and i am sorry i cannot watch it again until fall.

Great comedic actors and great script.  a win-win comedy!",1330041600,3,283,4.714285714285714
4543031,5,B0053O89U6,"Sofia Vergara, what can one say about this lovely, voluptuous, and talented woman who seems completely unimpressed with her looks, body, and comedic innocence.

The straight guy, Eric Stonestreet, acting as gay man, is the best since Robin Williams in La Cage. He has nailed this role.

We in this household have watched every episode at least 3 times, and some we will likely watch every time we need a laugh.

We brought them on holiday to fill in our evenings when staying in was preferable than going out.  We stayed in more just to re-watch seasons 1 and 2. Visitors who came for a week who do not watch television and do not allow there 14 and 16 yr old to do so, were persuaded to join us one evening and by the end of the Pilot, were totally hooked and every evening but two they insisted on watching at least 3 episodes each evening for a week.

One hopes that the writers, actors, and editors continue for many seasons to literally make the world a more tolerant place to live in.  There is absolutely no downside to this  series. It is that good.",1327795200,8,1057,4.38974358974359
