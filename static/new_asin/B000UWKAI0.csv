8607167,1,B000UWKAI0,"This video does not contain any of the footage advertised. The *only* thing on this entire DVD is a cheesy and very boring 25 minute documentary about the 1984 elections. It was so bad that I can't even recall if it was made by the USIA or AID! Either way, the production value is that of a third-grade class, and the focus is on peripheral parties, not even ARENA or the PDC. Do not buy this DVD unless you want to waste your money. I had to give it one star otherwise I would have given it no stars or negative 10!",1232668800,5,516,4.068627450980392
