6112842,4,B00GU05MU2,"The DVD arrived in good time.  It has four helpful exercise sessions, with a variety of exercises included.  I use closed captioning when I watch Sit and be Fit on television, and the DVD does not include those, so that was the only way in which it wasn't a perfect five stars for me.",1398729600,14,284,4.2407407407407405
6112843,5,B00GU05MU2,I usually do workouts than anyone else can do but on those days when my arthritis is bad or I don't want to work too hard this is great. There's always a seated and standing version so it can be as easy or as hard as you can make it.,1389830400,25,233,3.68

6112885,3,B00GU05MU2,"This was a disappointment but not completely worthless. Clearly it was a slapped together 4 episodes from other videos and it was also too costly for that. Either do it right, or don't do it.",1485475200,,191,4.485714285714286
6112886,5,B00GU05MU2,The exercises are great for senior citizens but anyone who is an exercise novice will benefit from completing the workouts.,1484092800,,123,5.2

6112904,1,B00GU05MU2,"I bought a Sit and be Fit from ""Go Peachy"" early in August.  It was labeled Season 10 and had four workouts on it, which I liked doing.  I then ordered another Sit and be Fit through Amazon with a completely different front cover and back cover and found it to be the same exercise routines as the dvd from ""Go Peachy""  I paid $16.95 from Amazon and $14.90 from ""Go Peachy"".  There was no way to tell that both videos were exactly the same.  I would appreciate an opportunity to receive a reimbursement for either video or the opportunity to pick another exercise video and receive it as a replacement for free.",1473724800,,611,4.371681415929204

6112910,5,B00GU05MU2,Great. Suited perfectly for our SENOIRS high rise for weekly exercises without special staff. Present or encouraging with reasonable pace for all to keep up. Makes it fun!,1457913600,,171,5.142857142857143
6112911,4,B00GU05MU2,Very good video. It is just enough of a workout to work up a sweat but never hurt your muscles if done properly. I try to do it a couple times a week when I don't walk. I would recommend it.,1456012800,3,190,3.658536585365854
6112912,2,B00GU05MU2,I was looking for something a little more movement to stimulate heart rate.,1454976000,,75,4.846153846153846

6112925,3,B00GU05MU2,"I truly appreciate some of the exercises Mary Ann demonstrates on the video.  I have 2 issues with the DVDs - in some instances there is unnecessarily wasted time and I would like to have seen her guests fully demonstrate techniques from their field.  Otherwise, I found a lot of useful information which I generally do without the DVD at a pace I like.",1448496000,8,353,4.5
6112926,5,B00GU05MU2,"Excellent! I have a chronic condition that affects my balance, as well as strength. I have been using the program for several weeks and already am seeing a difference in my abilities. I will definitely purchase more of sit and be fit DVDs to change up my routines!",1443916800,2,264,4.520833333333333
6112927,2,B00GU05MU2,BE forewarned--NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!!!!!  My mother is 90 years old and MUST have subtitles or closed captioning.  She cannot hear any programs and needs closed captioning.  I never dreamed that this would not have closed captioning as a large portion of its viewing audience/participants would probably be seniors (many with hearing problems).  Shame on whoever put this video out--it needs closed captioning!!!  It would be a great video if closed captioning were included and I would probably rate it 4 or 5.  Closed captioning is a big thing for me and takes away greatly from any rating I give something.,1441238400,,609,5.04
6112928,5,B00GU05MU2,Good and gentle. Easy for ANYONE to use.,1441152000,,40,4.125
6112929,1,B00GU05MU2,Not what I expected.  Not much of a challenge; boring.,1440806400,,54,4.4
6112930,3,B00GU05MU2,"I bought this for my mom, who is in her seventies with significant back problems.  Then I sat down and did one of the four segments with her.  It was challenging for her, but definitely not for me, which is probably the right difficulty level for most seniors.

However, the pacing was not what I would want in a workout video.  She spent too much time talking at different points, but then when it was time to do the exercises she transitioned too quickly from one movement to another.  It was a very amateurish production.",1439942400,6,524,4.473684210526316
6112931,3,B00GU05MU2,it's not for me,1439769600,,15,3.0
6112932,2,B00GU05MU2,"It may be the age of the DVD production, however, the use of this dvd has been very difficult on my parents DVD player.  I purchased it for my 83 year old father to use.  We haven't been able to get to the various chapters.  Other than that the actual content is okay.  The pace of the activites is just right for him.  We are dissapointed that we are unable to get the other chapters to work.",1439424000,2,393,4.0519480519480515

6112936,5,B00GU05MU2,"I work for a retirement community and my residents love this work-out. They say that she keeps them on their toes and thinking because she moves from one movement to the next so quickly.

For these workouts you'll need: towels, resistance bands, weights, and small golf ball sized balls (preferrably stress balls so they can be squeezed).",1432598400,16,338,4.9298245614035086

6112943,5,B00GU05MU2,"This was a gift for an 83 year old who is recovering from shoulder surgery.  She loves it!  She especially likes the fact that you can either stand or sit for many of the exercises and the hosts (instructors) don't pressure into feeling like your a failure if you cannot do ""ten"" but only three or four of the exercises.  She also likes that the exercises are shown in both a sitting action and the standing actions.  To hear how happy my friend feels about working out with this disk makes the money spent an excellent investment!",1425945600,12,531,4.443298969072165

6112959,3,B00GU05MU2,"Her first exercise DVD was better.  She needs to do more repetitions for each exercise.  Also the editor should delete or reduce the number of voluntary laughs which I found distracting.  In essence, the editor or director needs to do a better job.",1409443200,10,248,4.72093023255814

6112961,3,B00GU05MU2,WOW I have never thought moving my fingers around was exercise! Perfect if you are in your 90's but I have Multiple Sclerosis and I need a little more intensity than that. Glad I tried it though!,1406678400,,195,4.297297297297297

6112963,5,B00GU05MU2,"I am a long-time fan of Mary Ann Wilson's television exercise program. When I came to the assissted-living facility, I could no longer get her program and the planned exercise activities were not daily. I now can do my exercises in my room as often as I want. I hope everyone, but especially us experienced (Notice I did not say old!) people will discover how beneficial exercise can be.",1399420800,28,387,4.6231884057971016
8627515,5,B00GU05MU2,"Mary Ann is such a gentle, effective leader/tutor/coach as she goes through and explains the exercise workout.  Exceedingly easy to follow along, and she explains -- and makes it interesting and fun -- to work along with her.  She's a talented, knowledgable fitness coach and offers varieties of positions for exercises if somone is not able to do them standing, or needs extra support.  The exercises work, at improving my balance, strength in my legs and overall flexibility.  Well work the investment and i truly enjoy the CDs.  Demographic may be for those recovering from injury, the disabled, the elderly, or the couch potato who wants to start moving.  i've got spinal cord issues, osteoarthritis, have had multiple surgeries, and  yet her guiding kind encouragement and matter-of-fact approach makes the viewer want to participate.  i'm very glad i do. My knees, hop back are easier getting stronger to keep s[asms at bay, and my balance is improving.",1532131200,,959,5.063694267515924
