BRINGING UP BABY: An eccentric heiress (Katharine Hepburn) and a stuffy professor (Cary Grant) chase a pet leopard all over the town in Howard Hawks' celebrated masterpiece of screwball comedy.  Special Features: audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich.

THE PHILADELPHIA STORY: Philip Barry's Broadway play comes to splendid life with Katharine Hepburn in her stage role of spoiled heiress Tracy Lord, whose ex-husband (Cary Grant) comes back into her life on the eve of her second wedding.  Special Features: audio commentary by Jeanine Basinger, and a trailer gallery for George Cukor.

WOMAN OF THE YEAR: The first of Hepburn's several teamings with Spencer Tracy, the only actor who could ever cut The Great Kate down to size.

3674303,5,B001KXZGNW,"TCM (Turner Classic Movies) could not have chosen four better examples of classic golden-era romantic comedies, and it's no coincidence that Katharine Hepburn stars in all four. At the same time, it makes you wonder why they simply didn't call this DVD set the Katharine Hepburn Romantic Comedy Collection. After all, there's an equally reasonable case to include classics from the likes of Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne or Rosalind Russell. To allow for the bargain price offered, the four films are presented on two double-sided discs. The print conditions are gratefully clean for the most part.

Director Howard Hawks, a master of this genre as well as many others, guided 1938's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Up-Baby/dp/B0007TKNCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Up Baby</a>&nbsp;(*****) and catches Hepburn and Cary Grant at their zenith in buoyant comic energy and youthful vigor. Amazingly, this wacky 1938 screwball classic was her first real foray into farcical comedy, and she makes her exasperating character Susan Vance the definitive madcap heiress. Cross-pollinating the pratfall wackiness of Lucille Ball with the Fifth Avenue glamour of Carole Lombard, Hepburn filters it all through her braying, haughty New England manner. Grant is her perfect match as David Huxley, the befuddled, bespectacled paleontologist, who aptly describes his inadvertent relationship with Susan as ""a series of misadventures from beginning to end"". Together, they keep up with the breathless pace Hawks sets with a hair-brained plot involving an elusive research grant, a pet leopard that can only be soothed by one song (""I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby""), a mischievous dog with a yen for a missing intercostal clavicle (i.e., a dinosaur bone) and a gallery of comic character actors who make the mistake of trying to make sense of all the shenanigans. The veteran supporting cast is incomparably stellar, in particular, May Robson as no-nonsense Aunt Elizabeth, Charlie Ruggles as the likeably pompous Major Horace Applegate and Walter Catlett as the perennially confused Constable Slocum. With the crack timing of the comedy, the movie is filled with wonderful sight gags, and the sharp script (written by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde) has an abundance of clever lines and witty asides. Director Peter Bogdanovich, who paid tribute to this film with his partial remake,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-Up-Doc/dp/B00006FDC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's Up, Doc?</a>, provides insightful commentary on an alternate track.

Hepburn was born to play imperious Main Line socialite Tracy Lord in 1940's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Philadelphia-Story/dp/B0006Z2KXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Philadelphia Story</a>&nbsp;(*****). On the eve of her second marriage, Tracy is surrounded by three men who lay claim to her. With whom she ends up is no surprise, but the journey there contains all the biting wit and human insight that one could hope for in what is essentially a drawing room comedy. As Tracy's ex-husband, the pretentiously named C.K. Dexter Haven, Grant plays the most grounded character in the story, a romantic in cynic's clothing, watching others get caught in the fear of commitment and a gauzy haze of indecision. As the third point, a young and refreshingly cynical James Stewart portrays Macauley ""Mike"" Connor, a tabloid reporter covering Tracy's nuptials. Connor turns out to be a talented author, which Tracy finds immediately attractive. What is so refreshing about this triangle is that it never reduces itself to some heroic duel to win the damsel. In fact, both men have understandable reservations about Tracy's high-and-mighty stance and her inability to tolerate others' weaknesses. Further complications ensue with Mike's unspoken relationship with Liz Imbrie, his smart-mouthed photographer sidekick who of course, pines for him. As you can imagine, it all ties up beautifully, and all these complications come through with a great deal of humanity thanks to the wonderful, sometimes surprisingly edgy dialogue in Philip Barry's original play and Donald Ogden Stewart's screen adaptation. It is fair to say that the rest of the cast is fine but overshadowed by the three superb and fully embodied leads. A major portion of the credit for this first-class production needs to go to estimable filmmaker George Cukor, who is completely in his element here guiding his players to their peak. There is an informative albeit rather enthusiastic commentary by film historian and critic Jeannine Basinger.

Having already established the headstrong aspect of her screen persona, Hepburn added a worldly intellect and beguiling sexual ardor in her portrayal of multilingual political journalist Tess Harding in 1942's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-of-the-Year/dp/B00004TJOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman of the Year</a>&nbsp;(****) directed by George Stevens. In her first teaming with lifelong off-screen partner Spencer Tracy, she sets off palpable sparks with the normally taciturn actor, who plays sportswriter Sam Craig working at the same newspaper. Written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin, the plot is about the characters' whirlwind courtship from an immediate sexual attraction to an impulsive marriage, all the while struggling with each other's priorities. Needless to say, given that it's a product of its era, it becomes a matter of time before Tess bends to Sam's will but not until some intriguing observations are made about sex roles in a basically fractious relationship. However, rather than the comic fireworks generated by their later collaborations, this film treads in unexpectedly sentimental melodrama, especially in the episodes where Tess has to let go of a Greek orphan she wants to adopt and in the climactic scene when she tearfully recognizes her wifely responsibilities as her aunt Ellen marries her father. Still, the pair's familiar bantering occurs when Sam explains the rules of baseball to Tess and in the final feminist reversal as she fails miserably in her attempt at domesticity. Intriguingly, for a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle, it feels much more like her movie than his, and consequently their rapport is not quite up to their normal standard here.

Seven years into their screen partnership, Tracy and Hepburn made what is arguably their best effort together, 1949's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-s-Rib/dp/B00004TJOD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam's Rib</a>&nbsp;(*****), the sixth of nine movies they made together. The zingy repartee and old-shoe comfort in their relationship are in full bloom here as directed by Cukor. Written by the legendary husband and wife writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, the plot focuses on a headline-grabbing court case involving Doris Attinger, a dim-witted wife who shoots her philandering husband Warren just as he is caught with his blowsy mistress Beryl Caighn. Representing the wounded husband is Assistant DA Adam Bonner who is looking for a quick conviction of the wife. However, his proto-feminist attorney wife Amanda sees the alleged crime as an act of justifiable defiance and decides to defend the wife. This potentially tense set-up leads to a trial where Amanda sets out to prove that a double standard exists for women and that Doris was merely defending her family and home. Adam, however, believes that the law is the law no matter the gender of those involved and that a murder was indeed attempted. Consequently, the story is not so much about Adam's inherent sexism as it is about Amanda's single-minded determination to prove her point even as the case degrades into a media sideshow. Hepburn plays such a convincing litigator that her case actually sounds persuasive at times, and Tracy brings his unique combination of sympathy and combustible bluster to a man who respects his wife deeply but becomes increasingly disillusioned with her unlawful stance. As Doris, Judy Holliday delivers in her first significant screen role, bringing a deeper pathos to the scorned wife than you would expect. Tom Ewell plays Warren for the smarmy, sexist cheater that he is, while Jean Hagen expertly plays Beryl as a media-hungry floozy. As the Bonners' next door neighbor Kip, David Wayne acts rather fey for someone who supposedly wants to run away with Amanda, but I suppose the approach was intentional to ensure nothing would really threaten the Bonner marriage except the case. However dated some of the sexual politics feel, the film is still one of the most smartly played of romantic comedies.",1236643200,4,8796,5.712213740458015

  This recent purchase a gold mine to someone who revels in fine directing, witty dialog and talented, dedicated actors.  I was a little thrown off when I saw the unlabeled discs, but, believe me, I'll take great movies on plain discs over the fancier-packaged second-rate ones any day.
  The quality of the picture and sound for each of the 4 movies is very good.  The only extras for ""Adam's Rib"" and ""Woman of the Year"" besides their movie trailers are subtitles.  The other two offer some commentaries, subtitles and their original movie trailers.
  Since I almost never view the unnecessary baggage usually included on movie discs, this is no loss to me.  Turner Classic Movies can leave off all the fluff they want as long as they continue to offer this kind of quality at such a remarkable price.
  ""Adam's Rib"" and ""Woman of the Year"" pair Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy and I always enjoy these two playing off each other.  (An additional bonus for old movie buffs like me is that you'll see Judy Holliday, showing some of her wonderful flair for comedy, in a supporting role in ""Adam's Rib.""  And Tom Ewell as Judy's philandering husband is no slouch, either.)
  I will admit I prefer some of the later Hepburn/Tracy films more (e.g., ""Pat and Mike"", ""State of the Union"", ""Desk Set""), but the two films in this collection do show two wonderful actors in top form.
  In my opinion, ""Bringing Up Baby"" remains one of the finest screwball comedies ever made.  Hepburn and Cary Grant are perfectly matched in both this one and ""The Philadelphia Story.""  You just don't get better than these two.  Add Jimmy Stewart and Ruth Hussey in major supporting roles in ""The Philadelphia Story"" and you've got a real winner!
  One note:  Each film is on 1 side of this 2-disc set.  Many of you may have come across this before, but it took a moment of thought before I realized I had to flip the discs to see the 3rd and 4th movies.
  If you enjoy quality comedies, I can't recommend this one highly enough.",1236384000,3,2383,5.218997361477572
3674305,5,B001KXZGNW,"I purchased this set of movies at wal-mart. (Sorry Amazon!!)This is a WONDERFUL set of classic romantic comedies at a GREAT price! I have always wanted BRINGING UP BABY but have found that it is rather expensive by itself. It's a hilarious comedy with Katherine Hepburn & Cary Grant. Grant is a palentologist waiting on the last bone to complete a dinosaur exhibit. Hepburn is a socialite who ""runs into"" Grant on the golf course, who just happens to have a leopard named ""Baby"". Needless to say, Grant & Hepburn stumble through crazy shenanigans to fall hopelessly in love. The other movies are just as good or better. Jimmy Stewart & once again, Cary Grant come to review the social highlight of the year. The marriage of Hepburn to one of society's finest, most eligible bachelors. Grant, happened to be Hepburn's first husband, reviewing the marriage in the society pages, along with Stewart. Well the reviews lead to a rekindling of an old flame. Needless to say, Grant has to write his ""own"" review. Loaded with LOTS of laughs!!ADAM'S RIB is Hepburn & Tracy at their finest as huband & wife lawyers. Hepburn comes to represent a woman who shot her philandering husband caught in the act. Tracy is the District Attorney who she has to defend her client against. Tracy & Hepburn's ""magic"" is evident in this funny, romantic comedy. WOMAN OF THE YEAR is Hepburn & Tracy's first movie together. The screen sizzles as Hepburn a political pundit, battles Tracy a sports writer. Fortunately, all the sparks that fly kindle a romance. This is a great way to introduce yourself or your teenagers to ""classic movies""!!! I love this set at such a wonderful price! You can't go wrong with this set.",1234483200,28,1692,4.758503401360544
3674306,5,B001KXZGNW,"This is one of 27 sets of four movie packs that Warner Home Video plans to release in the next few years. Their purpose is to introduce classic film to people previously unaware of these films via very affordable bare bones versions of these movies. This set has four very good films, all featuring Katharine Hepburn.
Woman of the Year (1941) - The film that introduced Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy and sparked a long relationship both on and offscreen. Here Hepburn plays an early feminist who goes around collecting causes. Spencer Tracy is the sportswriter that loves her. They marry, but things go downhill quickly since Kate is really already married to her causes.

Adam's Rib (1951) - Ten years have passed and Hepburn and Tracy have aged a bit, but the spark and the chemistry is still there. This time the pair are married lawyers. He is a prosecutor and she a defense attorney. Problems arise when Hepburn defends a woman who shot her husband when she caught him cheating on her and Tracy is the prosecuting attorney in the same case.

Bringing Up Baby (1938) - One of the original screwball comedies. Stars Cary Grant as an anthropologist who gets mixed up with a very dizzy young woman played by Hepburn. The plot involves a tame leopard - Baby - and a dinosaur bone buried by a dog - the exact whereabouts are unknown.

The Philadelphia Story (1940) - Reteams Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant as a divorced pair of socialites. Hepburn's character is about to marry a man of the people who pulled himself up by his bootstraps, and also happens to be one of the most annoying people who has ever lived. James Stewart oddly won a Best Actor award for what is essentially a supporting role. It is especially odd when you think about all of the other great performances in which he was the undisputed lead and he wasn't even nominated.

3674414,5,B001KXZGNW,"Great collection.  I just wish TCM would get into the modern age and offer these collections on Blu Ray (even better 4K downloads).  What really is irritating is that when these films were transferred they didn't just make 1080p masters in the first place.  The amount of work would have been about the same.  Sure the equipment was more expensive they only had to buy it once and use it for multiple films, the real cost is labor which shouldn't have been much different.  In the long run it would have been much cheaper.  Now they have to do it twice.

Most of these digital transfers were done when HDTV was already on the market and starting to gain traction.

Hopefully they will be smarter this time and do it in 4K or even 8K so they don't have to do it again.",1428710400,,767,4.314685314685315

They work so well together in both Adam's Rib and Woman of the Year.  Very enjoyable as they work through completely different problems in each movie as a married couple.  Enjoyed Philadelphia  Story and Bringing Up Baby very much as well.  Cary Grant is his charming and funny self in both, as he takes on 2 completely different characters.  Both movies I found to be hilarious and a lot of fun to watch.  Jimmy Stewart wasn't bad, either!",1420502400,,551,4.551020408163265

3674460,1,B001KXZGNW,"Although this collection is 4 films there are only 2 DVD's. That's fine. What is horrible is that it is impossible to read the fine print in the center of each of the 2 DVD's indicating what films are on each DVD and the fact that one film is on one side with the 2nd film on the reverse side of the disk. I had to find a magnifying glass to attempt to read the labeling of each disk and even using that I had great difficulty reading the extremely fine print. I cannot comment on the quality of any of the films as I have not viewed them yet. However the labeling of the disks is a major turn off and that is the sole reason for the 1 star review. This is the first time I can recall running into this kind of issue and I own around 1,000 DVD'S. The DVD's are distributed by Warner Home Video.",1392595200,3,794,3.96875

3674467,5,B001KXZGNW,"Loved watching these old movies especially Adam's Rib. Considered their finest pairing, Adam's Rib stars Hepburn and Tracy as the married prosecutor and defense lawyer in a sensational murder trial, with Hepburn defending a woman (Judy Holliday's first role) who shoots her unfaithful husband.  Based on a a true story, the couple battles in the courtroom and at home, over equality, womens rights and the law - and the resulting tension leads each to consider the attractions of someone new. Intelligent, funny and beautifully written by another husband-wife team, Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin.",1387324800,,595,5.329787234042553

3674471,5,B001KXZGNW,"I love these films and I've seen them a number of times, but it's wonderful to get uncut, clear transfers. These are a great group of films to have together and a wonderful introduction to classic comedies. The Hepburn's partnership with Grant in _Bringing Up Baby_ and _Philadelphia Story_ is spirited and inspired. BUB also features some amazing camerawork for the time--the film required finding new ways to get the stars of the film and a leopard in the same shot. _Adam's Rib_ and _Woman of the Year_ offer interesting gender dynamics and may well inspire debates and arguments in your living room. It's harder for me to watch _WotY_ without some cringing these days, but _Adam's Rib_ actually provides some very interesting commentary on gender inequality despite being hamstrung (by the era perhaps?) in just how far the film might assert female power.",1384992000,,859,4.972222222222222
3674472,2,B001KXZGNW,"One of only two DVD's in recent years that didn't play right and had to be returned. My copy ""stalled"" on ""Bringing Up Baby"". No visible ""scar"" or smudge on disc. If you can find a good disc, ""Bringing Up Baby"" and ""Adam's Rib"" are the best (funniest) of the 4 films, so I bought 1-movie disc copies of these 2 films.

3674477,3,B001KXZGNW,"First off I love every single one of these movies, but I was a little disappointed with how the set came.  I own at least four of these TCM collections, and this is the only set that I have received that is on double-sided disks.  Yes, I know that it says in the descriptions that it the films are on double-sided, but so did the other collections I bought and when I received them they were all on separate DVDs.  I just figured they had updated their sets onto four separate disks. One side of one of the disks came really scratched, and I just feel like they could repackage these items so they don't have a risk of being scratched.",1380585600,,635,4.231404958677686

3674485,5,B001KXZGNW,Adam's Rib is perhaps my favorite of them but Bringing up Baby is a close 2nd. The Philadelphia Story is Romantic Comedy with nothing held back. Kate Hepburn is a classy lady and she does comedy spectacularly.,1374969600,,209,4.675675675675675

Just two discs, with one film on each side, and a very few ""extra"" features.  For very little money.  The first set included a damaged DVD that would not play the whole films, but I returned it for a replacement and had no problems with that one.  I'd hesitate to give it as a gift, knowing that many customers have had quality issues with the TCM series, unless the recipient is someone I knew well enough to be sure they'd feel comfortable telling me if theirs was damaged.  On the plus side, I got four flicks for less than $1 each, and they are ones we won't mind watching many, many times.

3674520,4,B001KXZGNW,"For under $20 this collection of 4 classic films is quite a bargain.  Yet, the movies themselves are not among my favorites.  The actors are all wonderful, but the stories just leave me a bit unsatisfied.  I purchased this for ""Adam's Rib"" and ""Woman of the Year"", since I already have ""The Philadelphia Story"" and have never cared for ""Bringing Up Baby"" (I'm just not a fan of this type of screwball comedy wherein the heroine acts selfishly and preposterously most of the film, driving the leading man crazy, yet they still fall in love).  Yet even if you only want half of the films, it's still a bargain.

Both ""Adams Rib"" and ""Woman of the Year"" have top-notch performances from Hepburn and Tracy, but both stories are essentially anti-feminist morality tales.  In the films, Hepburn's character is self-centered and manipulative, though not entirely unlikable, but Tracy's character is depicted as nobly self-sacrificing, even though he's not always better than she.  At the end of the movies I'm left with the strong impression that these marriages are not going to last -- Tracy and Hepburn's characters just don't see eye-to-eye -- so, I'm left feeling unsatisfied, despite some fine acting and production.",1358467200,2,1215,4.985148514851486

In a nutshell, they are basically ""boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back"" movies.  Sure when you have seen one you have seen them all, but unlike movies from the 1950s and beyond, there is no blood and guts, there is good music, clean humor, and fabulous fashion.",1357862400,,469,4.63855421686747

Four movies, all featuring the queen of all queens, Katharine Hepburn, that showcase what romantic comedies should be but rarely are. Adam's Rib and Woman of the Year team up real life couple Kate and Spencer Tracy; both very different movies that deal with the evolution of the female role in society. Bringing Up Baby costars the always delicious Cary Grant. You will love Kate's comedic timing on this one. Last but least, the classic The Philadelphia Story. The cast, composed by Grant, Hepburn and James Stewart, is top notch. Literally, the best of the best.
All four movies are grade A+ classics. And for this price, do yourself the favor and BUY THIS SET! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",1351036800,,745,4.7384615384615385
