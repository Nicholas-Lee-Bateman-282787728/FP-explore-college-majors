147700,5,079284209X,"When do we think the last great Robert De Niro film was? I believe Ronin is the film that capped off his career. If you take a look at his IMDb page you can see that after 1998s Ronin, his choices of movies have been, how do we say this nicely, terrible. Honestly though, if you want to end your career on a high note, Ronin would be the way to do it. Its a fast-paced thrill ride that doesnt give up until the final credits roll. Featuring numerous car chases, shootouts, double crosses, triple crosses; Ronin is one film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I try to avoid recapping a movie in my reviews, and in Ronins case, it would be an entirely complicated thing to do, as the plot is somewhat convoluted when you take in account all the characters switching motives and stabbing each other in the back. All you need to know is that a group of people with particular skills are trying to steal a briefcase (the contents of which we never find out) before the bad guys sell the case to the rowdy Ruskies. Things aren't so simple, though, as complications start piling up as people in the group have their ulterior motives.

Ronin flows from one action filled scene to the next, continuously upping the ante each time. If the movie does slow down, its only for a few minutes, and those slower scenes are still quite entertaining thanks to the performances.

Speaking of the performances, I had a blast picking out all the actors who have starred in James Bond films. We have Sean Bean, who is in the movie and surprisingly doesnt have something happen to him that typically occurs in everything else he stars in (no spoilers, but I think you can figure it out). We also have Jonathan Pryce, a mysterious Irishman whom you will know from Tomorrow Never Dies. Further on the James Bond list is Michael Lonsdale, who played Hugo Drax in Moonraker.

Of course, the highlight of performances goes to our three leading players. First, we have Robert De Niro, who hasn't yet got his sleeping pill subscription. Second, we have Jean Reno playing a suave Frenchman like he always does. He bounces off Robert De Niros character quite well, and the two perform excellently together. Lastly, we have the lead female role played by the beautiful Natascha McElhone. She has plenty to do in the film; she isn't just your typical damsel in distress.

I watched Ronin on Arrow Videos new Blu-ray release, and its interesting to note that Arrow on the back of the cover mentions that this film was like a precursor to the more grounded action flicks that we would come to know like The Bourne Identity. That is very much true, but what I would like to point out is that Ronin does something that most action films tend to avoid nowadays. Director John Frankenheimer and DP Robert Fraisse dared to have the camera be steady and allow the viewer to see what the hell is going on. After vomiting up my lunch on the later Bourne films, I appreciate the steadiness of a movie like Ronin.

Arrow Video has done a superb job on releasing Ronin in a stellar Blu-ray package. The brand new 4K restoration of the film from the original camera negative is phenomenal, with no video issues apparent. The audio provided by Arrow is in both DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0 stereo, with the 5.1 sounding fantastic. It certainly fills the room when you listen to the 5.1 surround track. Of course, you cant forget that Arrow also provides plenty of extra features. The only new feature is an interview with the director of photography Robert Fraisse. Everything else is archival features, but its, of course, nice to have everything together in one package.

I think its safe to say that Ronin is a guaranteed purchase. The flicks story will keep your eyes glued to the screen and will blow your mind at how many times a double cross can happen in one film. Arrow Video provides a slam dunk once again with their action-packed Blu Ray release. You would be wise to pick it up right away.",1517356800,2,3967,4.524407252440725
147701,5,079284209X,"While I get a chuckle from John Wick I don't watch it as often as Ronin. Perhaps I prefer the realism that the film offers rather than the romanticism in other adventure films. It's not just De Niro but the entire cast who should take a bow for their parts in this Frankenheimer film. It reminds me of his other film, The Train, with Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield along with another fine cast. Even today I'm surprised how well De Niro and Lancaster fit into their roles for the films. Of course The Train is a darker film about the struggle between the SS and Resistance over a cargo of precious art aboard the train while it's being shipped to Nazi Germany from Paris towards the end of the war. Ronin concerns a field operation by an intelligence agency against a terrorist although it begins in Paris with the recruitment of a few hitmen for a job. Frankenheimer never reveals what's in the box. All the audience need know is its valuable and two gangs, Irish and Russian, will kill to get it. How neither side obtains the box and it finally falls into friendly hands, is the story of the film. In The Train when Lancaster finally stops and kills Scofield he sees it as little more than a Pyrrhic victory. In Ronin the good guys really do win and some awfully fine villains get what they deserve. While the chase scenes are good, they are plenty of fine scenes all through the film that are overlooked. After Sam (De Niro) and Vincent (Jean Reno) learn about Grigor's betrayal of them, they are sitting in a coffee shop and the ""where could he be"" scene starts until it's conclusion when it occurs to Vincent that they are following the wrong person. Then the exchange near the end of the film between Grigor and Mikhi, the Russian gangster, is priceless. There's a look of disappointment on Grigor's face when he realizes that the Russian would rather let his girl friend die than let him go! As other posters have noted it's a film that you can watch quite often and the addition of the DVD to your collection is well worth the purchase.  .",1517270400,,2049,4.464

147713,4,079284209X,"Most movie thrillers involve non-stop shooting and car chases but little else. There is rarely any story applied to them. Those that choose to offer story are often the most successful, the Bourne series for example, but have slowly been replaced with the non-stop action instead. RONIN is a great example of a movie with depth of story as well as plenty of action on hand.

A group of mercenaries gather in a caf in Paris before being taken to a special location for a meeting with Irish Deirdre (Natascha McElhorne). The group includes Sam (Robert DeNiro), Vincent (Jean Reno), Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard), Larry (Skip Sudduth) and Spence (Sean Bean). Deirdre briefs the men on why they were hired, to steal a metal briefcase from their target. No information about what it contains or who the man is, just that they need to take it.

As the team prepares they go to a meeting with a local arms dealer to pick up some of the equipment that they need. What they find is an ambush during which Spence shows that hes been all talk and with little to back up his bravado. Surviving the encounter he is turned out from the group who now heads to Nice to do the task at hand. What they don't know is that the Russian mob is also after the same case, something Deirdre knows having been told by her handle, Seamus (Jonathan Pryce).

What should be an easy take down turns into one of the best car chases ever filmed (and thats coming from someone whos not a fan of car chases). Eventually the team is able to capture the briefcase but soon discovers theyve been sold out by one of their own. Now not only must they find the briefcase and steal it once again, they need to take on the Russians while doing so. They also have their mind set on revenge for this treasonous act.

The film works on numerous levels. The story is well plotted out and twisted enough to hold your interest and have you guessing from start to finish. The combination of actors from various locations around the world helps in this case and offers a chance for some to make an appearance in an American film that helped promote their careers here. And all of the actors involved make their characters so believable, a sure sign of acting ability. DeNiro, never a name I would associate with an action film, comes across as both a deep thinking mercenary and a man who can handle himself in a fight. Reno, who had already proven himself in THE PROFESSIONAL, just adds to his status here.

The movie was the next to last film directed by John Frankenheimer, no stranger to thrillers or action films. Frankenheimer was the director of films like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THE TRAIN, GRAND PRIX and BLACK SUNDAY. His legacy is one thats hard to beat and this movie shows why.

I already owned a copy of this movie and many others may as well. So why bother picking up a new copy of it? The answer is easy. This new version is being released by Arrow Video. Ive said before that Arrow is a company to be reckoned with when it comes to quality releases on blu-ray.

The movies appearance is a great place to start with a 4K restoration of the film from the original camera negative produced by Arrow Video exclusively for this release, supervised and approved by director of photography Robert Fraisse. The extras are just so much icing on the cake and plentiful. They include an audio commentary track by director Frankenheimer, a brand new video interview with director of photography Fraisse, a Paul Joyce documentary on Robert DeNiro, RONIN: FILMING IN THE FAST LANE an archival behind the scenes featurette, THROUGH THE LENS an archival interview with Fraisse, THE DRIVING IN RONIN an archival featurette on the legendary car stunts in the film, NATASCHA McELHONE: AN ACTORS PROCESS an archival interview with the actress, COMPOSING THE RONIN SCORE an archival interview with composer Elia Cmiral, IN THE RONIN CUTTING ROOM an archival interview with editor Tony Gibbs, Venice Film Festival interviews with DeNiro, Reno and McElhone, an alternate ending, the theatrical trailer and a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork. In other words you get quite a bang for your buck.

I remember when I first saw this film I wasn't all that impressed with it. I mean I enjoyed it but it didn't leave a huge impression on me. Time has changed that opinion. Watching it now Im more impressed with what is on the screen. The car chase, as I said, is more outstanding to me, especially in a world where directors now seem to think the best way to pad out a movie is to include a boring standard car chase. This one is one of the best. If youve never seen the movie don't buy the cheap used flat DVD out there, pick this one up. Youll be glad you did.",1506988800,,4752,4.56924882629108

147722,4,079284209X,"After the wilderness years in the 80's where drinking influenced his choices of projects (1979's ""The Prophecy"" , the mess of a movie ""The Challenge"") John  Frankenheimer's ""Ronin"" was a return to form with the creation of a suspenseful crime thriller. Frankenheimer took on plenty of projects just for the work but ""Ronin"" wasn't one of them. Here the director proves himself up to the challenging material in a way that hadn't been seen since his classic 70's films.

 A group of mercenaries gather to steal a briefcase.  No one really knows what's inside nor do they care as they are there for the payday from Deirdre (Natasha McElhone) who represents a crime syndicate. The thieves include a burned out former CIA agent (Robert De Niro), French thief who knows his way around guns (Jean Reno) who lead a team (Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean) who have their own mysterious reasons beyond  the cash to work with them.

Like ""The French Connection"", Frankenheimer (""Seconds"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Seven Days in May"" and ""The French Connection II"") creates a kinetic, memorable film. The script written by J.D. Zeolite (with additional rewriting from David Mamet) has plenty of droll lines and allows the actors to build their characters out of their actions as much as their words.

The film receives a beautiful 4K transfer from the original negative and carries over the commentary from Frankenheimer from the DVD as well as new video interviews and featurettes with the cast and crew discussing the making of the film. Make no mistake this isn't the Frankenheimer of ""The Iceman Cometh"", "" Seconds"" but one who has found a renewed sense of purpose in this powerful thriller.

The 5.1 lossless mix sounds great and we also get a great stereo mix of the sound as well. Subtitles are only in English.",1504051200,,1807,4.901639344262295
147723,3,079284209X,"Ronin stars Robert De Niro. The title is a Japanese term for wandering samurai warriors whove been disgraced by their failure to protect their masters. The film concerns a band of international soldiers of fortune who rendezvous in a Paris Bistro summoned by a mysterious Irish woman named Deirdre (Natascha McElhone).

Hired to retrieve by force a briefcase of undetermined contents from a shady group of men, the group includes two Americans, logistician/intelligence expert Sam (De Niro) and driver Larry (Skipp Sudduth); laid back French triggerman Vincent (Jean Reno); former KGB agent and electronics expert Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard); and British military veteran Spence (Sean Bean).

Ronin benefits from an A-list class and an A-list director (John Frankenheimer, The Manchurian Candidate), but is a fairly routine thriller with some spectacularly staged car chases and action sequences. The plot is murky, and contains implausibilities and convenient coincidences. But the pace is brisk, and Frankenheimer doesnt leave us with too much time to pick at the scripts shortcomings.

The contents of the briefcase are never revealed, but are beside the point. Its simply the McGuffin  a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock to refer to the item that sets the plot in motion but is not the primary concern of the audience. Ronin is a competent action film, the French locations are picturesque backgrounds for the action, and the central characters an interesting cross section of men willing to risk their lives for the right price.

Bonus materials on the R-rated, widescreen Blu-ray release include audio commentary by director John Frankenheimer; new video interview with director of photography Robert Fraisse; documentary about Robert De Niro; archival behind-the-scenes featurette; archival feature on the films car stunts; archival interview with actress Natascha McElhone; alternate ending; theatrical trailer; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork; and collectors illustrated booklet containing new critical writing.",1504051200,,2054,5.677524429967427

Arrow Video are now my new heroes.

The 4K scan from the original negative is gorgeous. As advertised it was all supervised by the films original cinematographer. It is very unfortunate that the films director could not have lived to see this, but I think he would have been impressed.

In this case there are 1733 reviews (!) of Ronin) listed here, under the Special Edition which won't be released until August 29, 2017 (Three weeks after Im posting this). I was provided an advance screener in exchange for an OBJECTIVE review.

I won't discuss the plot of the1988 film itself very much. You can read some of that (if you want) on other reviews. And, I don't like Spoilers, so you won't find those here either. I will say that if youve seen the film The French Connection, you will know that Director John Frankenheimer LOVES car chases. You will also only remember the car chases from TFC and probably not the plot. (Well, I dont). Thats also the case here. There are a bunch of loose ends and a real McGuffin here (to get you off the trail) but Its the car scenes and the actors that will keep you busy. One car chase runs a full eight minutes!

Now to this Special Edition from Arrow Films. They had the film beautifully remastered and had it checked by the films Director of Photography Robert Fraisse. It looks gorgeous. They then added all the bonuses that were on the previous MGM edition of the film (on DVD and BD). These include over an hour of featurettes. (And if you want to see how much the restoration process brought out , you Have only to compare the quality of the images in the MGM featurettes with the images in the Arrow restoration.) And there is the full length commentary by Frankenheimer.  But for this special edition, Arrow sat down with Fraisse in May 2017 and did a 25 minute interview, which is here. They also included a 28 minute appreciation of star Robert DiNiro done in 1994 by Quentin Tarrantino. This doesnt concentrate at all on Ronin, but his earlier films. Its worth a look. There is also the alternate ending. So in total  not counting the Frankenheimer commentary  the total special features are longer than the 122 minute film itself. Theres more too! A nice 36-page color booklet with a lengthy essay on the film by film journalist Travis Crawford. All the bonuses and reading the essay should be delayed until after you see the film.

No this is not Citizen Kane. Its not that much of a classic, but it is exciting to watch and the bonuses make it a film course on a single BD disc. Arrow has been remastering lots of films lately, but many are horror films, of no interest to me. But its film like Stormy Monday and Crimes of Passion (both of which I awarded five star reviews to recently, that have me anxious to see what other films they plan to release in special Editions like this one.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The possibilities arising from this array for violence and betrayal are fully exploited in the quite convoluted but essentially clear plot.  The film features some great photography of Paris and southern France, and a series of cinematic set pieces, including not one but two car chases which are so good that they are exciting even if you've gotten tired of movie car chases, an extended urban shoot out, ditto, and some beautiful figure skating, something you don't expect to see in an action movie.  Notable among the cast is Sean Bean in an atypical non-heroic role. Definitely an above average action film which anyone who likes that genre will want to see.

For yet the umpteenth time (it feels like), please allow me to begin a movie review by stating that Director John Frankenheimer's Ronin is just one more movie I ""discovered"" on TNT, initially watching bits and pieces of it. Finally, a day came when this movie was on and not opposite any football or baseball games so I viewed it in its entirety. I'm glad I did. It is a great movie, and yes, I now own the dvd.

* ""Ronin"" is the name given to masterless samurai warriors.

Story

Ronin is a European action/suspense/thriller--set entirely in and around Paris--which begins with Sam (Robert De Niro--no last name is ever given), a world-weary, mercenary-for-hire walking down the alleyways of old Paris and entering a tavern--ostensibly for a drink, but he is actually looking for a job.

Already inside the tavern, and pretending (not so successfully) to be either patrons or barkeeps are Sam's soon-to-be teammates. Among these are Deirdre (Natascha McElhone--the group's organizer) and Vincent (Jean Reno).

Sam is taken into a large, abandoned warehouse where Deidre explains to him, and the others, that they are being contracted to steal a briefcase. ""What is in it?"", Sam wants to know. He isn't told.

It must be something pretty damn important, because it turns out that Russian Mercenaries are also after it and it is going to take  more than one attempt for ""our heroes"" to obtain it. But, once they do--the action and suspense really start to build as the double--and triple (!)--crosses begin. All of this action takes place throughout the burghs and streets of Paris and features one of the best car chase sequences ever put onto film...culminating, ironically, with a quiet, poignant ending.

What is in the briefcase? Who is playing whom? Who are the real good guys in this film? You will find yourself asking these questions throughout this smart, stylistically produced and choreographed, movie.

So, naturally, I do not want to spoil it for you...and, I won't.

However, A Few Comments on What I Particularly Liked

* Robert De Niro and Jean Reno. These two (of our best) actors have an incredible on-screen rapport. I like how they establish their characters' friendship. It begins with the subtle approving of the other's methods by a ""nod and wink."" Then, when the movie's first action sequence begins--at night, with the Eiffel Tower gleaming beautifully in the background--Sam has a moment where he is going to have to put his full trust in Vincent. He does, and a bond forms that lasts throughout the entire movie.

* Natascha McElhone. Even in a gritty movie/role such as this, this red-haired Irish beauty radiates the screen...and no, this is not a bias in any way on my part because I am part-Irish, myself. Furthermore, there is an underlying romantic tension between her character, Deirdre, and De Niro's Sam that will, in addition to the movie's main plot-line, also keep you guessing as to just exactly how this relationship is going to turn out.

* The car chase(s). Contrary to what you may have read, this is decidedly not a filmed car chase in which a movie happens to ""break out."" It is exactly the opposite, but when the time comes to race, be ready. You are in for a treat as our mercenaries, good and bad, light up the streets (and skies) of Paris, Old and New. These sequences last for several minutes and it is very hard for me to believe that nobody was harmed over the course of their filming.

* The interaction (once again) of Sam with fellow-merc, Spence (Sean Bean). Spence is a loud, obnoxious punk who thinks yelling and cursing is the secret to making one's self a ""bada**"" (if only it were that easy, Spence). After Spence utterly falls short on the group's first time out, he immediately comes back and tries to pick up where he left off...saying he is going to lead everyone on an ambush their next time out. Sam has had enough (you will have seen this coming) and ambushes Spence using only a cup of coffee. Yet another great sequence between De Niro and one of his cast mates.

* Sam's bullet removal. Obviously, he can't seek help at the local hospitals, so Vincent takes him to a safe house whereupon arrival, Sam (having only taken a local anesthetic) talks Vincent and (Vincent's friend) Jean-Pierre through the entire procedure. When the bullet is finally extracted, Sam leans back, sighs, and remarks, ""Go ahead and sew me up on your own, I think I'll pass out now.""

* The rest of the cast: Stellan Skarsgard, Jonathan Pryce,Skipp Suddeth and Michael Lonsdale all turn in (as usual) fine performances. I also like that, former Olympic and World Figure Skating Champion, Katarina Witt (one of mrroland's ""all-time favorite 'babes' ""), has a small role in this film, too.

The DVD

Special features on this dvd include:

* A ""Never-Before-Seen"" alternate ending, and

* An excellent, full-length commentary by director John Frankheimer. He gives us much-insight into this picture's making, including the car chases (of course).

Furthermore, he gives us  interesting tid-bits of information--for example, porn star Ron Jeremy had a small role in the film but he (Frankenheimer) was forced to cut his scene because test audiences broke up laughing upon seeing him, breaking the film's tense, dramatic ambiance.

Frankenheimer also states he lived in Paris for several years and wanted to shoot a movie there.

Finally, I also enjoyed hearing Frankenheimer's commentary during a steamy scene between De Niro and McElhone. He explains why he chose to not go sexually explicit in this scene.

This commentary is Filmmaking 101 for all aspiring filmmakers out there.

So Finally

Ronin was among the final films of Director John Frankenheimer's legendary career, and the first one of his films I ever viewed. Subsequently, I have come to learn he was considered in Hollywood to be the ""master"" of the political thriller. I believe this whole-heartedly. This first impression certainly made a big one on me.

Five stars

Thank you for reading.

Perhaps it still is, if only for the action, amazing car chases, good score,  and great plot.

It is not bloated with dull CGI effects and does not have a long running time. Please, fans of this movie, go watch a film by Frankenheimer called The Train. It is in glorious B/W and starring the legendary Burt Lancaster. You will not be disappointed. I wish Amazon would show The Train and other Frankenheimer movies.

There were two amazing (at times unbelievable) car chase sequences. My one gripe is De Niro, not that he's a bad actor. It's the fact that De Niro is De Niro. His familiar presence spoils the illusion somehow and the bromance between him and Jean Reno became increasingly annoying at the end.

148656,5,079284209X,"I first saw the movie ""Ronin"" over ten years ago; and to this day, I don't think a better spy movie has ever been made. Everything in the film just fits and works together to make this an extremely watchable movie. Interestingly, it's able to do this without the dynamic fight scenes that are a staple of many of the genre's films these days (although the car chases wouldn't look out of place at all in one of the more recent Bond films or in a Bourne movie). Whether by design, chance or both, everything (cast, dialogue, story, etc.) just works together to make a movie that is just right in its composition. It's not too much and not too little in almost every way. The end result is a classic spy film. Highly recommended.",1461369600,,727,4.392592592592592

148676,5,079284209X,"Possibly an acquired taste, I've seen it three times over the years and would definitely fish it out of the Walmart $5 bin as a keeper.  All of the acting is precisely suited for this type of low-key noir intrigue, most of the actors are familiar faces, and DeNiro and Reno do their usual understated tension, brooding just below the surface, awaiting the signal for abrupt, controlled demolition.  In fact, they all do this.  Not much plot, Ronin isn't about plot.  It's about performances.",1461283200,,491,4.809523809523809

148688,4,079284209X,"I have watched this multiple times. As far as spy movies go, this one is more realistic IMO. There is no super villain, super-human science or John Woo Katana wielding motor cycle jousts. Plenty of car chases and gun fire though. It is interesting to watch Robert De Niro's character develop in the plot. Clearly more trained then the other operators and you are always guessing if he is working for the U.S. or really some kind of ""free agent"" who was possibly disgraced and likely the ""Ronin"" of the title. If you watch the movie, while De Niro's character really steals many of the scenes, Jean Reno is also quite awesome. Particularly when Reno's character ask's De Niro's how he knew they were about to be ambushed and De Niro's replies to his two questions are absolutely priceless. This movie sports an all-star cast that is fun to watch and Stellan Skarsgard and Jonathan Price are just *evil* as bad guys.",1461110400,,914,4.648148148148148

The 'rogue agents' angle of former spies now turned guns-for-hire in post Cold War Europe vying for the secret case was a brilliant comparison to the original Ronin, the disgraced Samurai. Sean Bean was played against his usual type, didn't add to the SeanBeanDeathReel so typical of his other roles. I would have liked to wrap things up with 'the girl' at the end but I understand why they deleted the scene and left it a mystery. The car chases were best ever filmed, better than To Live and Die in LA, or French Connection, and equal to the Bourne movies.

A ""ronin"" in Japan was a mercenary soldier, formerly a samurai whose original sponsor was killed.  The resulting shame forced his samurai soldiers to give up that title nad roam the country looking for work, exactly as today's soldiers of fortune do.  The film is gritty and seems to be true-to-life-- ex intelligence officers work hand in hand with treacherous IRA operatives to assassinate a political figure.  The car chase is classic.

148817,5,079284209X,"I just watched this again because it appeared on Prime. What a great movie it is. This is a spy movie for adults, even more mature than a Bourne movie. Robert De Niro gives a wonderful, understated performance. His character is tough as nails, but also obviously vulnerable in the way only a seasoned actor can be. As you watch this, contrast it with a James Bond film. Bond inevitably smirks through every scene, De Niro in Ronin, on the other hand, looks like he's constantly nervous about his surroundings. Sure, it's not as ""cool,"" but it sure brings you into the world of the film.

I remember seeing this when it first came out in theaters and enjoying it but not being as impressed as I was with this most recent viewing. Sometimes a film grows on you over time, and that's certainly the case here. There are a couple moments that I don't like, but they are very minor. I can recall two instances where the director set up a scene by flashing to some object before the object became relevant, and in both cases the forward flashes struck me as a bit clumsy. The ""wrong way"" sign is the more egregious of the two accompanied as it is by a surge in the music that doesn't quite work. The ""wrong way on the highway"" chase scene is very good...but it's impossible to do a better chase scene like that than the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Live-and-Die-in-L-A-Special-Edition/dp/B0007XBK7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Live and Die in L.A. (Special Edition)</a>. But Ronin is overall a better movie than that one.

The acting is top notch throughout. You expect greatness from Robert De Niro (and he delivers) and Jean Reno (who is also tremendous here). Sean Bean is perfect, and Stellan Skarsgard is a revelation. I believe this was the first time I saw him on film and he brings a tremendous presence to the screen.

There will be a few scenes that stick with you after watching this. The ""reflex"" scene, the ""ambush with a cup of coffee"" scene, the ""home surger"" scene, and ""post surgery discussion"" scene where the film gets its title. That last is actually a very polite interrogation as Michael Lonsdale tries to figure out if he's about to be murdered by the man whose life he has just saved.

The subtext is everything in this film. Even if you don't grab it the first time, chances are the scenes will linger with you. Maybe I thought it was a little too sure of itself on the first viewing, but with reflection I've come to realize that yes, it is that good.",1460246400,5,2528,4.712669683257919

The story is well-plotted, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing.  There's also plenty of action to keep things moving at a good pace, including some of the better car chases on film (there's a scene in one of the chases that will remind you Popeye Doyle chasing a New York El-train in ""The French Connection"").

Finally, the two-disc collector's edition is great choice if, like me, you enjoy taking a peek behind the scenes to see how movies are made.  The extras here include several very good making-of featurettes.

Keep in mind, this film isn't about the destination as much as it is about taking an interesting journey. All in all, this is two hours of fun escapism, where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1439251200,2,990,4.628571428571429

True...he is a bit old to be believably cast as the 'love interest' to the 'babe' in the plot...but it works fine.  For me, this film is strongly atmospheric.  I come back to it again and again to revisit the wet and cold Paris backstreets, the excitement of setting up the heist, the thrill of the car chases and the 'centered' warrior mentality De Niro projects so forcefully throughout the film.  Editing here is first-rate.  Cast could not be bettered--from the 'wanna-be Mercenary De Niro's character exposes to the 'Russians' who step in on the action to Katerina Witt in her one great movie role as an adored figure skating champion.

You wouldn't find ""Bourne"" style action or car chases, more like typical 70s and 80s wide shots.

I had a bit of a hard time getting past some of the other actors, as there were 3 James Bond villains!

The Byzantine plot is irrelevant as the viewer is blown away by intelligent, crisp dialog and mind-blowing action scenes and car chases that make ""French Connection"" and ""The Seven-Ups"" look like mere dry runs. Frankenheimer channels ""Bullitt"" director Peter Yates on this incredible whodunit, in the Alfred Hitchcock mold, and leaves the audience stunned. Prepare to be amazed. De Niro is the new Steve McQueen, due in large part to a talented supporting cast, including Jonathan Pryce, who memorably portrays a depraved Russian affiliate with exceptional aplomb. Frankenheimer excels at casting, and it really shows here, and naturally he gets the very best performances from every player. The film echoes ""Bulllitt"" because it is often difficult to ascertain what is transpiring, but the action is so compelling and the characters so fascinating that the viewer may not care.

They include THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THE TRAIN, SECONDS and GRAND PRIX. All those are among my favorite films. RONIN is a very good spy film that is characterized by great location cinematography, car chases, sets and great performances from a very solid cast that includes Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgrd, Sean Bean, Michael Lonsdale, Jonathan Pryce and Katarina Witt. French cinematographer Robert Fraisse achieved a look of realism in color similar to what John Frankenheimer had envisioned similar to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE shot in black and white. With the Production Design by Michael Z. Hanan, Art Direction by Grard Viard and Jean-Claude Lagniez supervising over 100 stunt drivers with Frankenheimer's close direction and sense of realism is achieved much like seen in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE TRAIN and GRAND PRIX.",1421280000,6,1048,5.396341463414634

The meet this Irish Lady who is the front man for whoever is hiring them to get this case . The cast is great , Robert DeNiro , Jean Reno , Sean Bean and many more . All these rouge agents are Irish , Russian , American, British  and French backgrounds  and the plot has many twists and back stabbing to get this case . Many reviews I read said its stupid because You don't get to know what's in the case , it really don't matter , many films have use this same plot device and it works here as well . John Frankenheimer is the Director and does magic with this film , and whoever was the second Unit Director who did the car chases without CGI is terrific , not one but two good chases. Now here is the downside of this Blu ray release , on the DVD version there was deleted scenes and on this release there's only a trailer. The picture and sound is okay with Me , since I mostly buy Bluray for CGI but I bought it for a low price and still liked it  .

148927,4,079284209X,"This is a wonderful movie well worth five stars, as has been eloquently highlighted by other reviewers. Ronin would easily get six stars from me--it is one of my favorites--but my pique is with the Blu-ray release. Colors and detail have improved, looking sharp and natural, but what is gone versus the DVD is John Frankenheimer's director's commentary. Ronin is not just an adventure-spy story, but also features some of the most superbly realistic car chases and special effects ever committed to celluloid before the age of CGI fakery. Frankenheimer's insights on how he achieved all this, of historical note, are an integral part of Ronin's enjoyment. The well-done booklet that came with the DVD, limning Ronin's back story and technical realization, is gone as well. One star less for that.

Thank you MGM UA for releasing this gem on Blu-ray, but let's hope your treatment of surrounding elements is not a telltale of diminishing standards. Your 90th Anniversary deserves better.",1412553600,,986,5.124223602484472

Attempted coercion by threatening to kill a person totally unrelated to the action. Self-surgery to remove a bullet from a belly shot, sort of an analogy to taking out your own appendix.

148951,5,079284209X,"Full of suspense, this action thriller hits on all cylinders. There are shootouts, gun fights, fist fights, car chases and all sorts of other action. As a matter of fact, this film has enough action in it for two films. The characters were well developed and the movie had me on edge the entire time. I simply could not get enough of it.

Robert De Niro plays an ex Agency spook who goes to work as a mercenary for hire in this well-made spy thriller. His accomplices all play mercenaries too; each one has his own job and task to perform and as we see as this film develops, some of them play their roles too well. From the rip off seen early in the film to the movie's culmination, where the rip off man is himself ripped off, we have an unending swirl of action and suspense where we literally don't know what is going to happen next. This movie will literally keep you on the edge of your seat!

I saw this on DVD for the first time since it was in theatres and I was shocked to see how much of the film I'd forgotten in that time. I remember the idiot fraudster and I remember the pretty girl and Jean Reno, but many of the other specifics I'd forgotten about; for instance, certain characters were killed in situations I'd forgotten about. Yet this only heightened my intense desire for the film as I did not know for certain how it would unfold.

See John Frankenheimer's audio track on the DVD extras. He goes into quite a bit of details concerning the film. I really liked the car chase scenes; but what really enthralled me was they were live action shots. No computer generated animation but just plain old fashioned cars driven by real life stunt drivers. That will always set this movie apart from others of its era and later years. The fact that things were really done only made the movie that much more realistic.

There is even a bit of comic relief in the movie but it's a kind of dry humor that one has to look for to find amusing. I'm the 329th person to give this film a Five Star rating and the 620th overall to rate it. Buy this film and you won't be disappointed.

Robert DeNiro challenges everyone involved, especially the lady that hired them for the job, Diedre, played by Nastasha McElhone. Soon the crew is weeded out and the double crosses become triple crosses. The end comes the hard way, after lots of hard knocks. Directed by John Frankenheimer, the chase scenes are exciting, the plot full of twists, and you'll forgive the odd absurdity, such as DeNiro's character performing surgery on himself. If you enjoy intrigue you'll enjoy this movie, as DeNiro and Jean Reno unravel what's really going on.

Robert De Niro and Jean Reno star as two of five members of a squad collected to get ""the case"".  What's in the case?  Who knows?  How valuable is it?  More than many people's lives.

I've yet to watch a movie with Reno in it that I haven't liked and that includes Steve Martin's Pink Panther movies.  Reno's action movies are as good as any kick boxing, kung fu, karate man's films.  Reno can be intense, loving, funny or straight forward.  In Ronin he is pretty much straight forward and intense.  De Niro seems to have enjoyed working with Reno.  Whether that's true or not, it seems to show as truthfully on screen.

Spend 2 hours of your life to watch a movie that works.  This film has more twists and turns in it than the streets of Paris does where it's filmed.",1408320000,,897,4.331325301204819
148972,5,079284209X,"One of the great action thrillers; tremendously underrated.  This is a great entry point for people who are unfamiliar with David Mamet.  Many reviewers comment on the car chase scenes, which are great, but make the mistake of thinking this a vapid action film.  But this is only because the philosophical themes are so skillfully and subtly woven into the plot.

The foundation of the film is an incredible script and intelligent characters.  Smart scripts and directors draw great actors, and this is obviously the case for Ronin - Robert De Niro, Sean Bean, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgard, Jonathan Pryce, and Natasha McElhone - are each capable carrying major films by themselves.  And there isn't a false note in the cast.  Even the small supporting roles feature fine performances: Michael Lonsdale, for example, who tells the tale of the 47 Ronin.

Mamet's plots are an exact opposite of the lazy writing style of typical Hollywood thrillers where stupid characters make mistakes in order to advance the plot.  (Think of the scene in Jurassic Park where the kids fumble with the flashlight and attract the T-rex).  Instead of preserving the fools, Mamet's moral logic eliminates them quickly so we can concentrate on smart characters overcoming impossible situations through perception and cunning.  The ruthless logic of the plot makes watching and rewatching a pleasure.

And like other Mamet films, Ronin is filled with clever turns of phrase, and subtle double entendres.  Befitting the high-stakes of their covert operation, the heroes speak carefully and elliptically in abstractions and streetwise metaphors.  An event is said to have happened ""in the late unpleasantness in your neck of the woods"", for example.  Elegant language, where the lack of clarity serves an important point.  The plot focuses around pursuit of a macguffin.  Some reviewers perceived this as a tiresome and worn clich, but for Mamet it's central to the plot's structure and themes.

""But who are we working for?"", De Niro's character asks.  It's a film about the relationship between identity, purpose and pursuit.  Who are these characters?  What are they pursuing and why?  Mamet hints at the film's philosophical purpose in the story of the 47 Samurai, the Ronin of the title, who, having avenged the honor of their dead master, have no further purpose, and commit ritual suicide.  The story of Ronin is the pursuit of an unnamed goal, by heroes of uncertain identity.  Mamet is always hinting, but never directly telling.

For example, this sequence:

Sam: Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt. That's the first thing they teach you.
Vincent: Who taught you?
Sam: I don't remember. That's the second thing they teach you.

Through such indirection Mamet's develops broader themes out of what otherwise is a simple heist film.  The hero must pursue a goal, a goal must serve a purpose, but what is a worthy purpose?  Mamet is never so inelegant as to raise theses questions directly, which is what makes this story such a pleasure to watch.",1408233600,,3041,5.038076152304609

I'm no world traveler but I certainly have heard of Arles. There are several lapses in the script like this that hurt the story's credibility but the action more than makes up for it.

149078,5,079284209X,"what's in the box?

I saw this film when it was in the theaters. I tend to watch it at least once a year. This has to be one of the best thriller/spy/action flicks I have seen.

The conversations are intelligent as is the entire film. They don't try to spell everything out for you but instead offer the benefit of the doubt that the viewer is in fact using his or her head. The violence in the film is done only when necessary and is not over the top by any means. Very refreshing for this type of film. Each of the characters has a past to which the film refers either directly or indirectly, but they do not go into too much unnecessary detail with these things. This all makes the characters seem real. These are real people. Many films have car chases, but this is the first time in years that I actually enjoyed watching one. the drivers looked like they were driving and they looked as though they were trying to avoid a crash. I will say this about the two chases, after multiple viewings these can get old. I'm not a fan of car chases, but I do recall liking the ones this film the first time I saw it.

There are many good actors in this film. I recognized most of the main characters as having been in other really good or great films. What was especially refreshing was that the actors gave us believable characters. I know I keep mentioning the characters, but I found this to be one of the main strengths of this film; something very very lacking in most. Robert DeNiro is a great actor, but often times we only get to see that Mafia personality that has haunted his career since the Godfather days. DeNiro is someone that can really transform himself when needed. The first time I saw this film, I did not who Sean Bean was. But he got my attention in this film. Everyone in this film turned in an outstanding performance.

The filmmakers chose to concentrate on important aspects of the story and stay away from using too many gimmicks. The story does not get sidetracked by an unnecessary and unbelievable romance, nor the usual empty sound byte of a character's past and not-so-hidden demons. Instead everything is alluded through their mannerisms, through knowing statements made to each other. We can see glimpses of each person's character and personality while the film continues through the heart of the story. I think it is beautifully handled.

After about an hour of extended firefights, car chases, and betrayals it is revealed that main characters are looking for a briefcase; that's it.  Another hour of firefights and car chases ensues, briefly punctuated by more betrayals.  At last a bloodied and broken De Niro limps off with the precious briefcase.  So what was in that briefcase that motivated government agents, terrorists, and mercenaries to rip Europe apart to get it?  We'll never know.

As I mentioned before the contents of the briefcase aren't even hinted at.  For all we know De Niro could have spent the entire film chasing after a briefcase full of gummy bears;  the kind of gummy bears that taste so good you'd kill for them.  What about De Niro's character? The film reveals little more about him then it does about the briefcase.  All we know about De Niro's character is that he's a paranoid old American male with some form or another of government training.

To be clear this isn't the kind of movie that keeps you guessing till the end, it's the kind of movie that keeps you guessing after the end; presumably so you'll pay to see the sequel (which in this case was never made nor planned).",1386892800,2,1315,4.625

Even a cameo by German Olympic skater, and super-hottie, Katarina Witt. Then throw in that the whole thing was filmed in France (Paris, Arles, Nice, etc.),  and add to that unbelievable car chases and shoot-outs. You get perfection. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie and I never tire of it. Kudos to director John Frankenheimer !!  This movie easily beats the 'Jason Bourne' series with Matt Damon.

I didn't even watch the on-line version but I did watch the movie nearer the time it was originally released.  I just remember that the movie never disappoints and it seems like he brings his co-actors into a higher state of performance.  Nothing really specific for you to latch on to in my remarks but talent is talent.  Period.

Buy it, watch it, enjoy it, in that order  : )

I bought it, couldn't watch it, couldn't enjoy it.  The first disc, with the movie on it, wouldn't play in any of my players - it wouldn't load or display anything.

The script seemed canned and by the numbers instead of creative cinema art. De Niro is one of my favorites, but even he couldn't overcome the lousy directing and crummy script. The accents of the characters were transparently fake. There was little suspense as every scene was so predictable.

149317,4,079284209X,"I have always felt that Ronin was greatly under rated as both a fine film and great acting by DeNiro whose more recent films clearly show him to have become a caricature of his own persona.  I have watched the standard version of Ronin several times and have finally picked up the Blu-ray edition.  Unfortunately, the Blu ray version has no extras while the original release had alternate endings and others.  The Blu-ray versions audio makes excellent use of the surrounds both front and back where appropriate though there is little use, if any, of the subwoofer when, clearly, there are many opportunities for it.  That perplexes me to no end.  The car chases are some of the most exciting and unique found in any film and have a very real purpose.  If the mulitple  cast of characters who contribute to the various sub plots and mysteries are sometimes a touch confusing, the 'silver case' is reduced to nothing more than a prop for the world of Ronin to surround around.  One never finds out exactly what is in that case but that is not even important.  The video itself is of 'okay' quality.  Nothing wrong with it, no artifacts, no issues but I see little difference between it and the original DVD release.  As I stated, the audio is excellent tho the lack of sub usage is criminal and, for a movie of such action, the audio becomes more important to me than the video with its muted colors anyway.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

149319,5,079284209X,"Ever since I first saw this movie I've never tired of seeing it again. Robert De Niro plays one of his best roles as the calm, cool, collective former American intelligence operative who's hired to assist in the retrieval of a case - contents unknown - for which the client is willing to pay quite handsomely. The title of the movie ""Ronin"" was the name given to a Samurai Warrior during the Feudal Period of Japan (1185 - 1868), who became master-less as a result of either the loss of his master's favor, or his master's death. In this case, the word defines a group of special ops soldiers who no longer operate under the leadership of one's country, and are instead internationally hiring out their services as independents. This movie includes one of the best car chase scenes that you will see described in detail in the ""Extras"".

That said, I'm reviewing the feature (Ronin) as offered on Blueray.  The movie and audio quality are great, no complaints.  I'm disappointed that there were no additional features added, however.  I'm relatively new to the Blueray world, and with all the extra disk space BD has, I thought there would be a directors commentary.  I don't fault anyone for this, it wasn't advertised that way and shame on me for making the assumption.  I normally wouldn't care about it either, except that after I got it, a friend recommended I watch the commentary and that's when I realized there wasn't one.

so yeah, its not the prettiest picture, but its a HUGE uptick from the dvd, i think. especially the scenes at the colisseum, which i recall looking blurry, look, y'know, watchable now.

i saw it in the cinema, and don't remember it being a visual powerhouse, maybe thats just how it transfers over.

Two fantastic car chases do not make a good movie, especially when wedged in between a rudimentary caper flick involving a metal case that could contain anything from a bomb to dirty laundry, the contents are never revealed.  I have the suspicion that they didn't know what to put in this mystery case that would justified the cons and double crosses and all the forced urgency, so they decided nothing would do just as well as something.  The sad thing is I really didn't care what was in this case (worth killing and dying for) as it is not a movie I will ever watch again.  Not a keeper in any case.",1307232000,,919,4.364705882352941

I read on Rotten tomatoes from the critics more often that they felt this movie was okay.  In the end it comes down to personal preference.  Although I do believe quality is an important factor in any film ie; story, characters, direction, special affects and writing.  Robert De Niro has some of the greatest one liners in the film and Jean Reno as a supporting actor opposite was a perfect choice.  I'm someone who likes to watch the extras or the making of for my favorite films.. I watched the extras on the second disc.. and was a little borish.

149332,5,079284209X,"If you're looking for a great action packed adventure with lots of shooting and phenomenal car chases you need look no further, this is it!

The title Ronin, according to the booklet that accompanies the DVD, is from Japanese legends and described a disgraced Samurai warrior who had allowed their master to be slain and was forced to wander the land looking for work. After the cold war was essentially over, covert agents had to look for employment elsewhere as mercenaries.

When a special job required the assembly of a team of crack mercenaries a group was brought together for a one-time job that turned out to challenge even their special skills at mayhem and carnage. This movie picks the viewer up and carries them along on a thrill ride that doesn't stop.

The cast features Robert De Niro heading a number of very familiar actors whose names may not be all that familiar to the average viewer. The result is an intense action film that is completely involving to those who enjoy action films. I've viewed it many times and enjoy it all over every single time.

Directed by John Frankenheimer, the film used a stark camera effect, much of which was shot ""with a Steadicam hand-held Camera, giving Ronin a realistic documentary look."" The film was shot in France in a number of well known locations and ""the climactic finale was filmed in Paris' Zenith arena, where nearly 2,000 extras were used in the chaotic sequence.""

This is one terrific action film that will stand repeated viewings. If you enjoy the genre you'll definitely want to add this one to your collection.",1303084800,3,1581,4.755474452554744

However, a second viewing with the director's commentary switched on revealed an actually very intelligent and well-acted film. While this extra input should not really have been necessary, it was worth it for this film. If you pay very close attention and/or are have seen lots of examples of the spy/crime genre and are therefore used to the perhaps inevitably twisted story-lines, you may even get it in one! However, even if you do, Frankenheimer's wonderfully intelligent explanation of his work is very highly recommended, and a major treat in itself. (Where would we have been in the days before the DVD special features section?!) So, while a little unbelievable at times, the film itself is generally quite a treat too, with some genuinely great performances (especially De Niro's), highly filmic Parisian and Riviera locations and neat camerawork - not least in relation to the truly outstanding car-chase sequences.

First of all, it uses old-school, low bitrate MPEG-2 encoding (so much for the the ""superior"" picture quality of Blu-Ray).

Fine, I could have lived with that... except for the fact that, as others have mentioned, the Blu-ray release contains absolutely no special features at all! None. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Not even the stuff on the DVD release! WTF!?!?

I suppose MGM will eventually come out with a ""Special Edition"" Blu-Ray with the missing features, expecting us to also purchase that. No Way!!!

I'm returning this for a refund. I've spent quite a bit of money buying stuff off of Amazon over the years, and this is the first time I'm returning anything. It should tell you how ticked off I am about this.

Now on to the movie: Every time I see this movie I am amazed at the car scenes. How did they film this on location Paris, Nice without killing anyone (maybe they did and I just don't know about it)?  The direction and how the cameras do not jitter at high speeds are amazing. It never looks like any of this was shot at slow speeds and then had the film sped up.

While, some might say the plot is contrived, I disagree.  I thought the plot was very good and engaging.  It created interest in all the characters early on and throughout the movie.

The chase scenes are some of the most epic put on film, if a tad redundant and somewhat long. A solid and thoughtful spy/action movie.

Briefly on extras: Unlike some other writers, I simply don't care about them. I was really into extras when DVD's first came out about 10 years ago, but I have long since lost interest and rarely do I view extras of any kind.

149378,4,079284209X,"*** BLU RAY REVIEW ***

For the first 20 minutes of John Frankenheimer's 1998 brilliant chase movie, you look at the BLU RAY box and wonder where the hell is the improvement? At the time they made it, they weren't of course thinking about future formats and their picture quality exposing limitations - they were just thinking about getting the mood right and setting up the plot. Filmed in a dark alley and then a dim French cafe at night, and staying there for quite a while - the opening clarity isn't great and I find that the BLU RAY format only accentuates this - the deficiencies of indoor lighting. But once you get to the daytime scenes that follow, then the fabulous city locations after that and especially to the close-up shots of the actor's faces, things improve dramatically.

And like that other genius caper movie of the Nineties ""The Usual Suspects"", not only could you not pay for such a stunning and diverse cast now - ""Ronin"" has admirably stood the test of time. It bears repeated viewing which of course makes it ideal BLU RAY replacement-fodder.

For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed the picture improvements - Nastasha McElhone's gorgeously huge eyes - De Niro's mole - Jean Reno's stubble - Sean Bean's sweaty brow - it's all there and amplified. And those fantastic car-chases that ""Bourne"" surely aped... There's even an unintentionally funny moment when Stellan Skarsgard is in his car with a gun and silencer about to trade the silver case to some dodgy type - you can see the lipstick accentuating his lips - its looks comical. And then that famous De Niro scene where he instructs Michael Lonsdale and Jean Reno to surgically remove a Teflon-laced bullet from his stomach without anaesthetic so he can remain conscious throughout and direct them properly - is just priceless (the title of this review is the dialogue De Niro speaks after the operation is over).

But as other reviewers have noted, the big let down is the lack of extras - and especially the absence of the startling brutal alternative ending where Natasha McElhone's Belfast character 'Deirdre' is involved - it's missing - and many thought it a better ending than the one used in cinema's.

And worse than that - there's no insights? I mean if ever a film deserved commentaries and a more than a few making-of features - then it's ""Ronin"".

Still - a great film - now visually improved - and as wicked a movie as you remember it.

Despite its bare-bones presentation - it's recommended.",1248307200,13,2489,4.721198156682028
149379,2,079284209X,"In feudal Japan warriors who did not have a lord but were free-lancers were called ""Ronin"", or mercenaries. This film begins in Paris. A man watches from the shadows. A woman enters a bar. Another man watches. [We know something will happen.] They are summoned to a meeting. ""Labor or management?"" They are to ambush a vehicle to hijack a container. The guards are well-armed, more information will be available. Sam asks questions. There is a meeting to buy the guns from strangers. Is there trust? Will something go wrong? Will there be a chase? ""Who are our employers?"" The details about the hijack are given. Is one of them unreliable?

The team arrives in Nice to scout the location. They photograph the target. [Nobody notices this!] There is surveillance at night. Can traffic lights be remotely controlled? The ambush occurs on a city street. How many inconvenient bystanders? Next is the car chase through the country and narrow streets. There is a shoot-out between the groups. Something goes very wrong. A meeting is arranged, the disagreement is resolved. What next? ""I know those men."" Cell phones provide instant communication. There is a chase through the Colosseum of Arles, more shooting, then an escape. Were they sold out? There is an operation to remove a bullet. No anesthetic for a tough guy. Will they get the keys?

So when I heard it was coming out on Blu-Ray, I was excited.  I love the high definition picture and high quality sound that Blu-Ray offers, as well as the ability to fit those and a slew of extras on a single disc.

Unfortunately, MGM/Fox decided to treat this great movie poorly for its Blu-Ray debut.  The picture quality is improved, but not up to par with the more impressive Blu-Ray catalog releases we've seen so far.  It is a single-layered release (using only 25GB of the 50GB available on a dual-layered disc), and uses a compression codec (MPEG-2) that has largely been abandoned in favor of better ones.

Worse, all the great extras from both DVDs are absent from the Blu-Ray.  Even the original DVD from 1999(!) had a commentary and alternate ending.  The 2006 DVD had those, a documentary, and a bunch of featurettes.

Ronin is undoubtedly John Frankenheimer's final masterpiece. Here is a film that stands out from the majority of the other large-scale productions that surrounded it in its day. Looking back on it now, a decade has passed since I saw this at the theatre although it sure doesn't feel like it at all. 1998 was a high-water mark year for film, unfortunately this film wasn't recognized at all during its release because of the heavy competition. But there was an initial buzz generated about the level of skill concerning the car chase scenes and was another vehicle for the much loved Jean Reno.

Ronin has an old world, classic film feel to it. It hits you from the first moments with the headshakingly unnecessary on-screen text of the story of the 47 Ronin, to the slowly fading in of the music, the gothic titles, the low lit caf and sullen look on Robert DeNiro's face that seems to be locked in place. Leading the viewer to believe that the protagonist Sam, is sizing up the French Caf when the films begins so he can either gun everyone down, or select a target, is the first of a thousand twists to the plot that get unwound, one by one, as the film progresses. David Mamet, who ghost wrote the screenplay and probably thought that it would be a clever idea to go left - each and every time you thought he was about to go right. A lot of negative things can be said about Ronin, but being predictable is not one of them.

The dialogue and the interplay between DeNiro and Reno is absolutely believable and the best part the film. Cigarette smoke seems to rise into the air from almost every surface, unshaved faces are peering out from every corner and middle-aged, out-of-work Intelligence Operatives chew on the meager remains of base and amateur criminal activity. DeNiro sleeps in his clothes, Jean Reno chain smokes and looks like he hasn't had a sober day in a lustrum. Ambushing Sean Bean (a guy with probably the most annoying name ever, playing one of the most annoying characters ever) with a cup of coffee is one of my favourite scenes.

""What's the colour of the boathouse at Hereford?""

The downfall of Ronin is the downfall that is seen in other movies. The same is attempted in Untamed Heart and also fails just as badly. When any film introduces important characters way-too late in the game, works out the final resolution at a sports event, or employ thuggish looking Russians wearing matching tracksuits and gold chains is usually just too much. Frankenheimer jumped the shark tank here when he introduced the figure-skating angle. Maybe they thought: ""Hey, this is cool. It's like the terror at the Munich Games in 1972."" The problem with that is, is that most people don't remember ""the terror"", or they just don't remember the situation at all, so the suspense is completely lost and the scene is too jarring and comes across as out of place. For this portion of the film, it becomes the perfect candidate for a fan edit at faneditdotcom and a deletion of the last twenty-five minutes.

As a short aside that might only be important to die hard U2 fans, such as myself, on the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop/dp/B000001EAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop</a>, which came out the year previous, track eight is a song titled ""Miami"". This song, according to Bono, was written while he was hanging around on set of Ronin. The lyric ""What's he got inside the case?"" is a direct reference to this film and not Pulp Fiction as previously suggested in a few other reviews of the album on Amazon. Just a piece of trivia, that's all.

Below I've made a short list of some of the films that came out in 1998. 98 was definitely a good year in cinema, and for the movies that I listed, I probably could've listed several more.

149412,4,079284209X,"Ronin is not your typical CIA spy movie ala James Bond, it's actually realistic.  Maybe that's what hurt this movie with some reviewers and at the box office.  What we get with Ronin is a serious spy/action movie of that genre that brings together a ragtag group of mercenaries who are hired to retrieve a briefcase at any cost.  What's inside the briefcase?  Well, we never know.  But who cares, really?  It's not about that really.  It's about the suspense, espionage, and double-crossing this movie brings to life in the streets of France.  This is probably how hired contracts are actually drawn up and executed in the real world.  When a superpower wants a piece of information, this is how they go about getting it.  But who can you trust?  Absolutely no one.

What steals the show in this movie more than the overall plot, is by far the car chase scenes on the streets of France.  I believe Ronin to have the best car chase scene to date.  I haven't seen one to come close yet.  Obviously the streets have been closed off and the cars are driven by stunt drivers, but you will be at the edge of your seat at a car chase that comes pretty close to 10 minutes in length.  How these guys managed to pull it off is amazing.  Kudos to those stuntmen. Hair-pinning turns at disastrous speeds absolutely draw you into the action.  While some of the acting may lack just that, you have to remember that real-life mercs are probably just like that.  Stoic, secret, and plain.  That's how they get the job done.  Overall an excellent thriller of a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  De Niro is top notch as well.  He can sell any role.  4 stars",1205280000,,1658,4.396039603960396
149413,4,079284209X,"John Frankenheimer's 1999 ""Ronin"" could easily have been another forgetable action movie.  Instead, Frankenheimer manages to invest the plot with real tension and the characters with significant depth.  The result, a loose riff on a Japanese legend about 47 masterless samurai, is an atmospheric thriller.

Robert DeNiro stars as a ostensibly out-of-work covert operative who answers a job interview in Nice, France, for an unidentified project on behalf of an unnamed sponsor.  The mission, as described by the nominal leader (played with silky Irish menance by Natscha McElhone), is to steal a suitcase containing a sensitive cargo.

DeNiro and his fellow operatives, notably Sean Bean as an alleged former SAS member, Jean Reno as a former French operative, and Stellan Skarsgard as a former KGB computer expert, put together and execute an ambush, only to lose the suitcase to another covert operation.  The stage is set for a series of thrilling car chases, betrayals, and a final confrontation with the real leader of the theft operation.  The loyalties of the various operatives are suspect right up to the finish.

The movie was filmed on location in and around Nice and Paris.  The dialogue is usually first-rate.  The interaction between DeNiro and his ally of the moment Reno is priceless, as two professionals do their job while trying to ferret out the real alligences of the other.

Frankenheimer tries to present the theme of the rogue agent by obscuring the purpose of the mission and the true motivation of the characters involved.  Unfortunutely, this leaves the film with a minimal plot where no one knows much about the background of the characters or the real purpose of their mission.  What is in the box?  Who are all of the characters really working for?  What are their backgrounds and real specialties?  Nobody knows.  Nice try but this attempt at presenting a plot of mystery seems to misfire leaving simply no real plot at all to cling to.  Good car chases but somewhat your typical Hollywood exagerrations with infinite obstacles avoided at unbelievable speeds and, of course, your gratuitous scene showing the spontaneous combustion of car wrecks.  The gun fights are completely unbelievable and make you wonder where these agents were trained to be so brazen in accomplishing their mission.

In short, the film has some good action sequences but leaves much to be desired in terms of plot and character development making it just another average action/suspense thriller.",1200960000,,1370,5.177272727272728

All are excellent and the opening setup scenes are tremendously well-done, with Frankenheimer making proper use of DeNiro and Reno's magnetic screen presences.

The plot concerns the retrivial of a mysterious brief case. All of the above cast members are hired mercenaries paid to get it back for an Irish lady. This is where the title comes from.

This film left me cold. The car chases were well staged, but after a while (and after 3 of them), I thought, isn't there anything more to this?  I agree with another reviewer where the Ronin references were contrived and meant to add some ""class"" but it didn't really work.  DeNiro was good, as usual and if he hadn't been in it, I wouldn't have cared at all.

The other thing about this film is that most of the action involved outsiders and innocents (people not involved in the plot)getting killed just because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Such carnage seems a bit cold, and also unrealistic. Such events would make international news--and when have we ever seen such events happening? Tourists in the Roman ruins, and how many in all the car chases--in major public areas (Paris, Nice)?

There's a reference to the 47 Ronin here, but the only reason that I can think of as to why it was included in this film was just for the screenwriter to make himself feel superior.  The story of the 47 Ronin has nothing to do with the characters here.  Ronin is a term meaning masterless samurai.  It initiated between 2 Lords, Asano and Kira.  Kira was an older master, and he treated Asano very shabbily.  Asano had tried to please Kira, but lost his temper and attacked Asano with a dagger.  Asano did no real damage, but an attack like this was forbidden by the laws at the time.  Asano was ordered to commit seppuku, which he did, but Kira escaped punishment.  Out of Asano's 300 Samurai, 47 decided to take revenge for this injustice.  They killed Kira, and then they themselves were executed, but they became heroes and remain heroes to this day in Japan and around the world.

149480,4,079284209X,"Ronin is a lesson in how to combine minimalism with an effort to be all things at once.  Ronin works well as a heist picture, and as such can be put on a double-bill with Ocean's Eleven.  Ronin is a relentless action extravaganza that pairs off well with Speed.  Ronin is part espionage thriller, and could be watched along with one of the Mission Impossible movies.  Or, forget about Ocean's Eleven, Speed, and Mission Impossible, and just watch Ronin, especially if you haven't seen it.

In Paris, an Irish woman called Deirdre hires several cloak-and-dagger types, of varying backgrounds, to steal a mysterious briefcase from some fella who wants to sell it to some Russian bidders.  A natural leader of the team emerges--Sam, played by Robert De Niro.  Even the early scenes, where Sam meets his edgy associates and quietly takes their measure, allow us to see how formidable an opponent he would make for anyone trying to hang onto invaluable luggage, or anyone who might be thinking of double-crossing him.  We see he is no stranger to black-bag operations, he is not afraid to ask key questions that may save his life, he knows how to smile and keep his own secrets so they can't be used against him, he assesses peoples' weak points from a few hints, and he is a master of anticipating what lies ahead and laying contingency plans.  This comes to serve him in great stead when the mission goes horribly wrong and he can't manage to liberate the invaluable suitcase and people double-cross him.  Various picturesque areas of France come off the worse for the resulting car chases, gun battles, hostage-grabbings, sniper attacks, slashings and beatings.  Sam and Vincent--Vincent (Jean Reno) seeming to be the only teammate he can trust--fight their way through all obstacles but never manage to get within about ten feet of the precious case before fate, or a betrayer, takes it beyond their grasp.  Then all of Sam's smarts can't help him as he takes a bullet through a bullet-proof vest.

This film is a sleek, streamlined affair that does not have the time or interest in letting us know too much about the characters.  From a person's accent, some lines of chitchat or verbal sparring, one has to fill in the gaps, between cars streaking by or shootouts erupting in the streets.  Always, always, it is about pursuing the prize past the bloody victims of whomever has decided to grab the briefcase and run.  The plot thrives because things go wrong--unlike watching Ocean's Eleven where we are to be dazzled by everything going right.  And things go wrong to excess in Ronin because no one does what they are supposed to do, everyone has their own agenda, everyone wants to win big by keeping the payoff money and the briefcase.  Sam plays this game very well but soon there is so much chaos that it is unclear whether he will live long enough to see what is in the case.

The actors--De Niro, Jean Reno, Sean Bean, Stellan Skarsgard, and Natascha McElhone, among other familiar faces--all bow to the briefcase's domination of their enclosed and violent world, and with their edgy, tight-lipped, shifty-eyed, sometimes paranoid, interaction, make us interested in who they are and what will happen to them, despite complete dossiers on them being denied us.  Even the film Speed gave us more human-interest stuff than what we get in Ronin, so if you really want to be hanging on by the tips of your fingers while a film races along, forget Speed.  And if you're more curious about what ex-spies and disgraced spooks do to earn money and get the thrill of danger than you are about pretty-boy goody-goody type spies with everlasting consciences, then pick Ronin over MI3.

What was in the briefcase everyone wants: maybe a copy of Ronin.  Enjoy.",1173571200,4,3754,4.786046511627907

What I would write is this, Robert DeNiro definitely carried this movie with an able help from Jean Reno. This is a movie about treachery, betrayal and self interest. A simple mission with complex characters who have their own agenda even although they need each other for the moment, to make it happened.

Just about everything in this movie worked superbly well. The car chase scene was exciting and well done, the plot moves along at a brisk pace even during the ""quiet scenes"" and characters proves to be believable and they act that way. Much of this can be credited to John Frankenheimer who directed his final movie with such skill and finese.

If there was a weakness in this movie, its that we have all seen this type of movie before. But then, its rarely done this good. I also thought Robert DeNiro's character was just too pat and by the middle of the movie, I began to realized that he was still on the official payroll unlike the others. Certain parts of the movie was bit predictable although entertaining.

The movie is well worth buying since despite of what I wrote about predictable, its a type of movie that will definitely be seen over and over if you have it in your collection.

(It kind of sad that this movie was Jean Reno's last good movie until he appeared on the Da Vinci Code. Of course, some might question if that movie was ""good"".)

This two disc Collector's Edition proves to be pretty good. The image is clear, color is good and sound is pretty aggressive. The extras are entertaining although like most extras, you can only watch it once. The commentary by John Frankenheimer is pretty good, he keep the narrative going and overall, this is a worthy upgrade.

149483,2,079284209X,"""Ronin"" sets out by telling the viewer about some Samurai warriors who were shamed when their lord was killed, via treachery, by another lord. This made them ""Ronin"" - or rogues. The movie itself bore scant resemblance to the legend it quoted -- which was only one of its shortcomings. Robert DeNiro phones in another performance, though Jean Reno did a creditable job as his ally Vincent.

The film follows the formation of a mysterious, multi-national gang of criminals hired by a mysterious Irish woman to retrieve a mysterious silver case. The gang doesn't know what's in the case, who they are working for or about each other. There's lots of gunplay, plenty of car chases, faintly interesting locales on the French Riviera and Paris, and lots of collateral damage to civilians. What seems to propel the movie is the lack of clarity about the motives of the gang members and the purpose of their activities. Seemingly, this was intended by the writers, who wanted to show criminals (or are they?) furiously fighting and dying for a cause they did not understand, as long as a lucrative reward awaited them. For the viewer, however, the unfolding drama was the only reason to keep watching this dud of a film.

For all its vaunted Samurai connections, Ronin was disappointing. The car chases were dull and seemed interminable. The accidents caused thereby were ludicrously overdramatic, with lots of flying sparks and gasoline explosions. The gunfights were ridiculously one-sided. By the end of the film, the silver case had changed hands so many times that the movie started to look like a comedy routine.

""Ronin"" is a standard shoot-em-up thriller that fails to deliver on its pretentious samurai metaphor. Hence, the 3 stars and a shrug-shouldered ""eh.""",1168387200,2,1762,4.98639455782313

Though he is the headline star, Robert DeNiro proves what a great acting talent he is and gives a completely selfless performance, stepping back, and giving his co-stars Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Skipp Sudduth, Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce room to shine. Written, interestingly, actress Rachel Weisz and J.D. Zeik, director John Frankenheimer brings intelligence and tense, high-octane action on to the streets of Paris.

149518,5,079284209X,"I have no idea why I had never heard of this movie before because Ronin is a whale of a good film.  I can take or leave most action films, but give me a taut, intelligent, suspenseful thriller filled with great action, wicked twists, and some of the best car-chasing footage you'll ever see, and I'm happy.  Throw Jean Reno and the one and only Robert De Niro into the mix, as well, and I'm happier than any clam has a right to be.  Director John Frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone doesn't make for a good action film, and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene.

The title is derived from the term for masterless Samurai of feudal Japan - warriors who failed their master and were left to wander in the shame of their failure.  In modern parlance (and in this movie), the term applies to special agents of various governments who find themselves quite on their own thanks to the end of the Cold War.  These men still put their skills to good use by selling their services to those willing to pay them for handling sensitive, usually dirty, jobs.  In this case, Sam (De Niro), Vincent (Reno), and three others are brought together in France by an Irish lass named Deirdre and charged with acquiring a metal case well-protected by its current carrier.  It sounds easy - ambush the target and his security force, snatch the case, exchange it for cash, and move on.  Naturally, the mission turns out to be extremely complicated, as a couple of powerful parties want whatever is in that case, and a certain individual proves less than trustworthy.  What's the world coming to when you can't even trust a selfish, independent-minded, well-trained gun-for-hire?  De Niro has to run over and shoot up half of France before everything gets resolved in this film.

The only problem I had with this movie came in the form of the thick accents of some of the characters, especially the Irish ones - you may want to use closed captioning at times to really understand everything that is said.  The actors themselves, though, were quite good, especially De Niro and Reno, who make a great team.  As for the mix of bad guys, how about three - count 'em, three - former adversaries of James Bond (Michael Lonsdale, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce)?  Not only that, the script is worthy of all these fine actors.

As I've mentioned already, though, the chase scenes are really the most memorable aspect of this film.  Frankenheimer doesn't have any use for these fancy-schmancy new digital means for manufacturing this kind of action, instead treating the viewer to several good, old-fashioned thrill rides through the streets of Paris and its local environs.  Besides filming an incredible number of scenes live, he also chose to forego the accompaniment of a musical score in these situations, letting the revving engines, squealing brakes, and numerous crashes and explosions present the action as authentically as possible.  They had to have had an incredible number of stunt drivers and stunt men involved, as folks were constantly crashing or jumping out of the path of oncoming cars - not to mention the extended high speed chase down one-way streets into busy oncoming traffic.  I'm telling you - these chase scenes are flat-out impressive.

Obviously, I think Ronin has it all.  Without De Niro, it still would have been a fantastic film; with him, it's a must-see in my book.",1158105600,,3462,4.7254575707154745
149519,5,079284209X,"When your heart races, when you sweat, when a movie envelopes you in a sea of intensity where you feel you are in the thing...the director has done his/her job.

I first noted Frankenheimer's work in the movie ""Grand Prix,"" just released on DVD.  I had never seen the movie prior, but it has aged well and I heartly recommend it.  I mention this because A) it is how I found this one, (a Blockbuster reccommendation based on Grand Prix), and B) because Frankenheimer notes his experience in Grand Prix being so integral to this one (lots for the car guys...).

This move starts slowly, but increasingly builds it's intensity all the way through to the end.  The extras provide an alternate ending, which is worth the view in my opinion, and settled some of my angst remaining upon completion.  Frankenheimer takes advantage of principles of information sufficency - he tells you enough to understand without (ever) revealing some of the fundamental mystery.  And he succeeds - the contents of the case will remain a mystery, as will the relationship between Deidre and Sam.  From that perspective, it's more like a book; you have to use your imagination to construct a satisfactory  synthesis, and in the end, that is more than enough.  -Alan",1156982400,,1242,4.788732394366197
149520,4,079284209X,"The entirety of Ronin involves a narrative that exists on just the other side of ""real"" -- competing political factions vying for a metal briefcase whose contents are a perpetual mystery.  The ""good guys"", if they can be called that, are a small coterie of mercenaries who were presumably relieved of their legitimate jobs with the winding down of the Cold War.  They're hired by an Irish faction operating in Paris represented by Dierdre (Natascha McElhone) via the unseen ""man in a wheelchair"", an agent for these ""ronin for hire"".  (Ronin were the ancient Japanese samurai who were cast out of their fiefdom for failure to adequately protect their liege, essentially becoming free-agent wandering warriors.)  They are of different nationalities, backgrounds, and possess different talents.  Sam the American (Robert De Niro), develops a kinship with the Frenchman Vincent (Jean Reno) and becomes de facto leader of the band. After a planned exchange for the briefcase goes awry, they devise and execute a violent ambush in the streets of Nice to get the briefcase and take out its current possessors.  When Plan B fails, the fun begins.

Through double-cross and intrigue, the briefcase remains elusive.  Plans are revised, payments are ""re-negotiated"", and hunters become hunted to the point of making for a five-sided chase. Even the Russians become involved, including an unassuming touring figure skater played by Katarina Witt.  It all sounds very contrived and even trite to a degree, but attached to this story are some of the fiercest street gunfights and most exciting car chases any action film fan could hope for!  Many innocents (and vehicles!) become victims, but these adversaries in espionage openly shop, dine, and roam the streets as if they're tourists and the French authorities are on some far-off planet. Through death and deceit, De Niro and Reno eventually form a buddy-buddy duo to exact revenge and extract payment.  ""Old friends from high school"" appear out of nowhere to aid in the alternating pursuits and escapes. Ironically, actor Michael Lonsdale, who was so great as the assassin-pursuing French Inspector Lebel in Fred Zinneman's The Day of the Jackal, does a marvelous turn as one of these convenient ""friends"", providing refuge to the pair for some do-it-yourself surgery.  While the hunt and chase is on, viewers are also treated to some marvelous French town and cityscapes, including the ancient Roman amphitheater at Arles and the traffic tunnels of Paris.

Ronin is a film for those who can suspend their sense of logic to allow themselves to be taken for the ride.  Thankfully, nothing devolves into outright camp a la James Bond. The danger of this approach is that for the film to be effective, the viewer must be held in thrall by these contrived characters and their actions to the point of being oblivious to their real-world consequences. De Niro, director John Frankenheimer and company manage to pull it off.  Because of its sheer unabashed cinematicism and no-holds-barred direction, Ronin succeeds in pushing this reviewer's grade one star above average when the film's holes could just as easily have let it fall one star below.",1155513600,,3183,5.117760617760617
149521,5,079284209X,"So you think you've seen car chase movies? Ronin is one heck of a ride! There are mutiple aspects to the movie which make such an awesome one that can be seen again and again (but yes, please don't sit with your reality-thinking cap on, just enjoy the flick)

1. The cast & characters : Ronin is one of those movies which has about 8-10 key people in the movie, and is probably the only movie I have come across where every single character is etched out to near perfection and played by its actor to the hilt. Be it De Niro as the supercool ex CIA agent, Jean Reno as the frenchman, the KGB dudes... each and every one of them, even if only in a cameo - every character has enriched the movie. And in doing so, the movie softly caresses themes like male bonding without probably really intending to, but does so in a brilliant manner.

2. The plot : Typical of any thriller, the suspense is kept till the end. The extra features DVD shows two alternative endings, showing clearly how complex a task it must have been for the director to actually end such a high paced and good movie. From the very first scene till the end, it is a plot that will keep you glued and waiting for the next scene!

3. Locations & Car chase sequences : Its a bit like ""Tour de France"" in a car, at 120mph. The locales from Paris to Nice to another small town with its own amphitheater, the angles in which the locations are shot and introduced, the narrow streets, the market on the roads, the coffee shop with the sit-out in the sun, the guided tours of tourists... its wonderfully pretty on the one hand & is the scene of some incredible high speed car chases that has one truly at the very edge of ones seat. I keep wishing I'd seen this movie on the cinema full screen, and hope its released someday again!

Once again - probably amongst De Niro's top 10 movies, Definitely worth a watch.

PS : The musical score is a haunting melody which is another reason to return to this movie time and again!",1154476800,,1981,4.272
149522,5,079284209X,"I love to watch action movies. Better still, I love to watch Robert de Niro in action movies (15 Minutes, Men of Honour, Godfather...). I also love to watch Jean Reno in action movies (The Professional, Mission Impossible, Wasabi...)

Imagine my surprise, when I saw both Robert de Niro & Jean Reno in the same action movie!

Ronin is a very interesting movie. Very exciting, too. It has a complex theme, a twisting plot as well as perplexing subplots, exotic settings, rising & falling actions, a critical but unknown object of pursuit, witty dialogue, all compounded by a host of mysterious key characters & their vague relationships (IRA terrorist, Russian mobsters, ex-CIA & ex-KGB operatives).

What I have enjoyed most from this movie is watching Sam (Robert de Niro) assuming the role of a strategist in the snatch team. As a strategist, he is always asking clarifying questions & verifying details. I am amazed at his astute power of observation, as shown below...just to name a few scenes:

- scanning the surroundings from various angles before entering the pub & checking out possible escape routes;
- sensing danger & spotting a sniper at the bridge while conducting a covert weapon buying exchange near the bridge;
- sizing up each member of the snatch team, especially Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard playing the rogue electronics expert) by intentionally pushing a cup over the table edge;
- reconnaissance, testing the camera & taking photographs unsuspectingly at a hotel lobby & creating a diversion...;
- noticing the wrong suitcase immediately after a ambush/shoot out;
- spotting a wall advertisement as a possible lead to the whereabout of the Russian mafia;

Even Vincent (Jean Reno) demonstrates it, especially when he spots, from a window in a cafe, a young girl carrying a metal suitcase, while trying to figure out with Sam the exact whereabout of Gregor, who had switched & stole the original suitcase earlier.

The Power of Observation is obviously a very important character trait of a Ronin.

I understand a Ronin is a masterless samurai. A lone-wolf. A maverick. A mercenary. Apparently, in the movie, each member of the snatch team is a Ronin.

In the movie, there is even a short history lesson about the exploits of the famous 47 Ronins & their eventual suicide ritual known as sepaku, as told by Jean Pierre (Michael Lonsdale). [Based on actual historical events, only 46 of them committed sepaku. The last one was pardoned by the Shogun.]

The most exhilarating parts of the movie are obviously the high-octane car chases & rampant shoot-outs in both Nice & Paris settings...on a quiet country road, a highway then through busy side streets & a tunnel. There is even an amazing scene, showing Sam doing his own surgery to remove a bullet from his stomach with a mirror & knife.

The most touching scenes in the movie are the dynamic comradeship & seemingly mutual respect between Sam & Vincent, despite the fact that each of them has his own agenda in the snatch team.

In the final scene, - & in fact throughout the movie' running time -, the critical but unknown object of pursuit remains a mystery.

To conclude this review, I have really enjoyed watching Ronin very much. Once again, I have also learned that human ingenuity & creativity are very important life (or survival) skills, as characterised in the movie. This is another addition to my resource repertoire.",1153612800,2,3401,4.9162303664921465
149523,3,079284209X,"*WARNING* Review full of SPOILERS

A masterless samurai? I suppose if Samurai had a complete and utter disregard for human life, maybe the premise of the move works. Maybe Ronin roamed the countryside randomly attacking their enemies and killing any number of innocent civilians who were just in the way. If they did, then De Niro as a modern Ronin is quite believable.

De Niro is a talented actor, and Jean Reno does a great job as his partner in crime. The supporting cast all play their roles excellently. If I was judging the movie on acting alone, it would get five stars.

The plot of the movie frustrated me. In the real world, there are no such people as these characters. If a group of such competent criminals existed in the world, they would rule us all. De Niro's incredible driving skill, shooting skill and ability to calmly direct crude surgery on his own body without the benefit of local anesthetic were all a little over the top.

Here's the thing - you can't just run around Europe getting into random gun battles and killing multiple people the way the crew in Ronin does. The amount of random violence between pursuer and pursuee is overwhelming and we see at least a dozen or more helpless civilians shot down during the multiple gun battles.

These are the sort of wanton scenes of violence we've all seen 1,000 times.

What's good: De Niro is always asking questions, looking at angles, and preparing an escape route. Very believeable and I liked that aspect of his character. I also liked the friendship that developed between Reno and De Niro's characters.

What's bad: The car chases are unbelievable. In real life, they would end with death. The gun battles are also hard to fathom - you cannot just run around a city with that much firepower and not get noticed and find yourself in the middle of a massive lockdown. The wanton destruction and ensuing escapes were too many too close together.

In the end, I let myself enjoy the story because it had good dialogue and good acting and that was enough to (barely) cover up my lack of suspension of disbelief. I was left wondering what was in that case that was worth so many lives.",1150243200,2,2160,4.606770833333333
149524,5,079284209X,"Ronin is quite an interesting movie. It has a stellar cast including Jean Reno as Vincent, Robert De Niro as Sam, Stellan Skarsgard as Gregor, Natasha McElhorne as Dierdre and Sean Bean as Spence. They are all professionals and when there are car chases and gun fights then you can imagine what kind of profession they are in. Yes they are sort of bad guys, yet they are clever and cunning and each one has a specialty that the others lack.

Vincent is a French coordinator, Gregor a German electronics expert, Larry played by Skipp Sudduth is the driver, Spence a veteran from United Kingdom and Sam, played by the often talented De Niro was a strategist. They find themselves in a room together after being hired by the long haired Natasha McElhorne who doesn't want to reveal what is in the silver cases they need to steal and more importantly who her boss is.

This movie struck me as if it ran on the principals of prison movies. The code of honor in prisoners, trust and honor between thieves and criminals who form loyalties even though they are not supposed to trust anyone. In Ronin the simple job of ambushing a three car caravan on a quiet road in cozy Niece, France turns out to be a tangled mess of suspense. The car chases were insane, performed through extremly intricate little European roads at top speed providing for long intense moments. There was even a chase in a tunnel with cars going  in the wrong direction at full speed.

De Niro and Reno quickly end up trusting each other yet they are never sure of what the other person really does in their spare time as everything is top secret. The whole cast of characters was wonderful, fully of trickery and false personalities as the viewer got to travel through the route to ultimate truth and the result of the ambush.",1150070400,13,1790,4.549689440993789
149525,4,079284209X,"When one considers director John Frankenheimer's career, it's almost a wonder he was ranked up there with other top names of his time like Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorcese; because for as many classic hits that he turned out (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE TRAIN, BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ, GRAND PRIX & BLACK SUNDAY), there were just as many stinkers.  Anyone remember FRENCH CONNECTION II, 52 PICK-UP and a particularly bad monster movie called PROPHECY?  His 1996 remake of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU was so bad, I concluded then and there that Marlon Brando should never again be in front of the camera!  Perhaps if RONIN had been released a couple of years later, Frankenheimer's final swan song would not have been the forgettable REINDEER GAMES.

Through all of its tense spy thriller action and several genuine car chase scenes, the viewer hardly feels cheated by never knowing what's inside the mysterious case (a-la PULP FICTION) that the team of mercenaries, lead by Robert DeNiro, is after.  Jonathon Pryce plays a chilling, frightening role as Seamus, a rogue Irish terrorist hell-bent on retrieving the case for himself.  Hard to believe this guy is a song-and-dance man, also.

Hands-down, RONIN is one of the most intelligent action spy thrillers ever made; a film that easily puts the more popular genre of DIE HARD and LEATHAL WEAPON movies to shame.",1149206400,,1362,4.973568281938326
149526,5,079284209X,"Director John Frankenheimer gained notoriety for his several critically acclaimed intelligent actioners and political thrillers of the 1960s, most notably his films ""The Manchurian Candidate"" which was held back for 30 years for its controversial plot and recently remade, ""Seven Days In May"" (a Rod Serling Script), and ""The Train"" with Burt Lancaster; and, for his critically acclaimed serious drama, ""Birdman From Alcatraz"".  ""Ronin"" is one of Frankenheimer's last films before his death in 2002 and it is his last intelligent actioner, except for his BMW-produced short car chase film following ""Ronin"" entitled ""Ambush"".  ""Ronin"" is the summary and mesh of his talent as an action director, and lies in the wake of his 1966 Cinerama/Ultra Panavision 70 film on the international race of Formula 1  entitled ""Grand Prix"", his 1975 thriller and car chase sequel

""The French Connection 2"", and also ""The Train"" for its several train crashes, political espionage, and explosion scenes.  As an action director, newer directors should pay close attention to Frankenheimer's films because they provide a great education.

The title, ""Ronin"", has no direct meaning to the plot of the movie, except in its parallel of meaning which is basically a statement that says the age of warriors never dies, that all people at times resort to an existential code above themselves.  I've heard a coined phrase of relevance, ""old-school"", or simply meaning a resort to an old way.  This film is about this contemporary version of existential honor and loyalty.

To show a direct example of this correlation, consider the film's middle scene with Robert DeNiro and Michael Lonsdale when they speak about the miniatures of the 47 Ronin.  Lonsdale describes the 47 Ronin miniatures to DeNiro by talking about the need to serve something outside of one's self, a man without a master.  After the death of the Samurai's master, the samurai has to revenge the responsible party.  If the samurai completes the mission of revenge, he then commits sepaku in order to end living with the shame of losing his master.  Sepaku is a form of ritualistic suicide where the samurai slices open his own abdomen and painfully dies from this wound.  The reason for it is that, once the samurai completes the task of revenge for his master's death, he has appropriately fulfilled his life.  He can then end it in this ritual manner.  Lonsdale picks up an Exacto knife with which he sculpts his miniature ronin, points it at his own belly, and moves it from camera right to left to describe this suicide.  Instantly after this motion with the Exacto knife, the movie cuts to the next scene to a passing car flashing across the screen in the same direction.

My theory is on the relevance of ancient times of history to modern contemporary times, that somehow they are connected to each other, and that this is the key to developing significant meanings from this movie.  It is about this logic pattern of evoking the past and ancient ways to handle personal crises.  It is about ""rite of passage"".  In some ways, this Frankenheimer film is very developed in symbolic value, even though very little of it bothers to describe its purpose.  However, this key scene deepens its subconscious waters.  The rest of the film, when seen through this metaphor on warrior codes, gives significance to understanding not only the characters, but the plot itself.

The several car chase scenes can and should be read as a contemporary version of ancient battles with swords.  In this way, the cars become symbols of the action scenes just as swords in a movie like ""Spartacus"" or ""Gladiator"" (2000), or any film with a duel.

Therefore, the act of knowing the contents of the briefcase, a holy grail to some, is not as important to define as the reason for living, to serve a cause.  When the film is read in this way, knowing what's in the case becomes less relevant than the acts a person will go through in achieving it, to which the film is actually about examining, questioning, and understanding the logic, reasons, and necessity for those acts.  A briefcase cannot be as significant of an object as an ideal, which is exactly why the movie ends the way it does.",1147478400,,4218,4.88623595505618

149548,5,079284209X,"The definition of the Japanese word ronin describes it as a samurai who has lost his master from the ruin of or the fall of his master. John Frankenheimer (with some final draft help with the script from David Mamet) takes this notion of a masterless samurai and brings to it a post-Cold War setting and sensibility that more than pay homage to the great stories and film of the ronin. One particular story about ronin that Frankenheimer references in detail is the classic story of the 47 Ronin. Ronin shows that in the latter-stages of his career, Frankenheimer was still the master of the political/spy-thriller genre. He infuses the film with a real hard-edge and was able to mix together both intelligence and energy in both the quieter and action-packed sequences in the film.

The film begins quietly with the introduction of the characters to be involved. We meet each individual in this quiet 10-minute scene that shows Frankenheimer's skill as a director more than Michael Bay can in two-hours of mind-numbing action. Robert De Niro as one of the two American mercenaries (or contractors) instantly becomes the focal point for everyone. His casual, but attentive reconnoitering of the Paris bar where the first meet occurs helps build tension without being overt. It's with the introduction of Jean Reno as the Frenchman in the group that we get the buddy-film dynamic as De Niro and Reno quickly create a believable camaraderie born of the times for such men during and after the Cold War. The rest of the cast is rounded out by an excellent and high-energy turn from Sean Bean as an English contractor who might not be all that he brags to be. The other American in the group was played by Skipp Sudduth who in his own understated way more than kept up with the high-caliber of actors around him. Finishing off and adding the darker and seedier aspects of the cast were Stellan Skarsgard as a former Eastern Bloc (maybe ex-KGB) operative and Jonathan Pryce as a wanted IRA commander wanted by all. The only break in all the male testosterone in the film was able played by the beautiful, yet tough Natasha McElhone. Like Sudduth, McElhone more than keeps up and matches acting skills with the likes of De Niro, Reno and Skarsgard.

The film moves from the meeting of the group to the actual operation which brought all these disparate characters together. Taking a page from Hitchcock, Frankenheimer and Mamet introduces what would become the film's MacGuffin. A MacGuffin being a plot device which helps motivates each character of its importance and yet we're left to believe only that the item is important without ever finding out why. The MacGuffin in Ronin ends up being a silver case which the IRA terrorists, the Russian Mob and seemingly every intelligence agency in Europe wants to get their hands on. It's up to De Niro and his group to steal the case from another party and this was where Frankenheimer's skill in seemlessly blending spy-thriller and action film shows. From the set-up of the team and their plans, to a near double-cross during an arms deal to the actual operation to take the case, Ronin begins to move at a clipped and tension-filled pace. There's no overly extraneous dialogue. Mamet's script-doctoring fleshes out the story and adds a sense and feel of intelligent professionalism to the characters. Outside of the Bean's braggart Englishman who gets his commeuppance from DeNiro's strict professional, everyone in the group had a skill to contribute to the operation and all did it well and believable.

The action sequences mostly involved car chases through the narrow streets of Nice, France to the metropolitan thoroughfares and tunnels of Paris. Frankenheimer shines in creating and directing these sequences. Sequences which he'd decided against the use of CGI. Using what he'd learned and perfected from his own past as a former race car driver and from his own classic film Grand Prix, Frankenheimer used real life cars and drove them through real (albeit choreographed) traffic to give the sequences that sense of reality and speed that one couldn't get with CGI. The car chase scene within the Paris thoroughfare tunnel against traffic has to go down as one of the best car chase put on film. I and those I saw the film with were on the edge of our seats as both protagonists and antagonists weaved their way through Parisian traffic at high-speed and gunfire. The crashes caused by this car chase looked believable and horrific yet the audience doesn't glance away from the screen. With just abit of help from second unit directors Luc Etienne and Michel Cheyko, Frankenheimer pretty much did most of the filming of the car chases. At times being in the car itself and doing some of the driving.

The story itself, after all the characterizations and high-energy, tense action sequences, was really bare bones and in itself its own MacGuffin. The story just becomes a prop device to help show the mercenaries' special sense of honor in regards to working with people who might've been enemies in the past and the murky world they now live in after the collapse of the black and white sensibility that was the Cold War. One little bit of trivia that I found interesting was the fact that Ronin included quite abit of actors who portrayed past James Bond villains: Sean Bean (Janus), Jonathan Pryce (Carver) and Michael Lonsdale (Drax).

In the end, Ronin became the last great film from a great director. I don't count Reindeer Games as anything but Frankenheimer picking up a check and the studio dabbling overmuch in the final look and feel of that film. Frankenheimer's Ronin is a blend of smart dialogue, hard-edged characters, and tense-filled action that he manages to blend together to make a fine and intelligent film. The story may not have made real sense in the end, but the journey the audience takes with DeNiro, Reno and McElhone's character in getting there made for a great time for all.",1142899200,99,5959,4.849705304518664

Inquiries and cars ambush, rush, collide through all the scenery of Paris, Nice and Arles. In some cases, even parking a car propelled the plot. The chases  zoom right up there with McQueen's Bullit. (Confused that I was sitting next to DeNiro or Reno, I kept reaching for my seatbelt.) The title offers a poetic metaphor that boosts the storytelling from a mundane shoot-em-up to a MacGuffin that would make Hitchcock take notice. The photography is stellar. The stunt work is amazing. The writing is good.  It warms up from a Pintaresque rhythm and then, through action and spoken word, plan and carry out the job and everthing else after. The actors masterfully embody the pros going after the package.  The villains are cold and evil. If there are good guys (I ain't spoilin' the surprises), they are played with all the complexity of humans having to find truth and making heavy choices. I adore the casting.

The scenery around Nice and Villefranche sur mer is wonderful to look at.  The director's commentary on the DVD is actually educational as, among many other things, he discusses the difficulties of showing small passages of time in a movie, issues of framing scenes, and test audience reaction to the various endings.

There is also just a lot that happens in this movie, you might think that it was three or four hours long.

There is a realism about this movie that most spy thrillers lack.  There is a nice sub-text going on critiquing the gung ho, invade first plan later approach to violence with a more experienced, careful approach.

And, on top of all else, there are a handful of marvelous one-liners in here as well.  Punk trying to show off: ""You ever kill anyone?""  DeNiro: (dismissively) ""I hurt somebody's feelings once.""",1141171200,,919,4.808917197452229

It features Mr. Deniro (before he got into comedy) as an American in on a deal to rescue a case for Natascha McElhone, a great and unusual beauty doing a convincing North Irish accent. His partners are internationals, a Swede, a Brit, and a Frenchman (the admirable Jean Reno, who looks like he smells like a wet cigarette). Much danger and excitment quickly follow. It's all the better for it's constant affirmation of its gritty, intelligent, and suddenly violent reality. And even if you don't like car chases, well, you might after you listen to the director's commentary. You'll know as much about cars as the guys on the radio. I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it. It's the work of a very experienced man (Frankenheimer), who feels that understatement, restraint, and timing are the most powerful parts of storytelling. The story is a spy game, post cold-war, so no Bad Russians..oh wait, there are some bad russians. But it's clear that Frankenheimer cares less about the politics and more about the players. In the commentary Frankenheimer talks about not only the function and performance of the actors, but he gives us an inspiring lesson on his technical craft.

The sound of the engine in the tunnel were dead on..

I might be a bit biased here because I have an E39//M5 and I am a car person so I am more inclined to give the movie a 5 star rating just for the car chases (Audi S8 and //M5 chases)

It is a film of subtlety as well as heart-pounding, beautifully-filmed action. Courage, love, honesty, and loyalty in the midst of betrayal are all themes that the movie artfully explores and develops. Alert viewers will note how the theme of ""waiting"" is woven through the plot. The development of the relationships between the characters is wonderful to watch. The conversation between Sam and the Ronin model-maker is especially delightful, as they speak a ""language"" they both understand, but you don't. My only caveat are several instances of unnecessary profanity (""Unnecessary profanity"" is, of course, redundant). I watch the movie with a ClearPlay DVD player and filter so the profanity is muted out when I watch it, but if you don't have a ClearPlay DVD machine, you will hear it. Also, there is considerable violence in certain scenes as ""civilians"" get caught in crossfire. I rate it only four stars for these reasons.

149582,3,079284209X,"I was given this film, purely because it's impossible to resell, and the person who gave me it got it on special edition. So this is now taking pride & place in my DVD collection. I've apparently seen this movie before, but didn't review it at the time, but rewatching it, I don't remember a thing about it. I remember the second car chase, where they go through the Paris tunnel, where Diana & Dodi Fayed died, and although this car chase was just as spectacular, the first, more simplistic one was great too. And I don't remember that! But I'll review it now. Just to make sure.

The car chases are pure spectacular in this. There's no CGI, unlike Matrix Reloaded, or no major jumps over 50ft gaps, like Speed. Just simple speeding, and crashing into other cars. I'll never understand how car chases like this how managed! Stunt drivers are used, but it must take a hell of a lot of work to get it right. To make it look like Robert De Niro and Natasha McElhone were actually driving during the car chase, right hand drive cars were used, with the passenger side made up to mirror the real controls. The actors then mimicked the stunt drivers movements.

My favourite character in this was Natasha McElhone (Deirdre) - try saying that when you've had a few! The last name is a real tongue twister, and it took me most of the duration of the movie to get my tongue around it. She's great looking, and has gorgeous clear skin, and gorgeous hair. I felt there was a real chemistry between her & Robert De Niro's character, even though he's loads older, and lets face it, not exactly Mr Hunk of the century!

Robert De Niro I think, looking back on the movie is perfect for this role of Sam he played. He's quiet, resourceful and deliberate, and plays the part perfectly. He's not a typical in-your-face hardman hitman. Him & Jean Reno make a great team together.

I found in this movie a lot gets pushed aside to keep the action flowing throughout, and not have any dull moments. I found this particularly with the would-be romance between Sam & Deirdre, that could have been brought forward, just slightly more, instead of one big kiss and that's it. Nothing more.

The scenery is fantastic in this movie, based all (or nearly all) in France, around Nice & Paris, but with not many great landmarks, so you can come into the middle of the film, and not where the hell it's based. There's not constant shots of the Eiffel Tower, or other French landmarks.

You never find out what's in the case during this, which in some ways, can be bad, and can be good. For instance, you can use your imagination as to what's in the case, and not feel stupid for thinking that it's this, that or the next thing.

I loved the fact that Natasha and Jonathan Pryce spoke with Irish accents in this. Previous reviewers have said they found this irritating, and although Jonathan didn't speak that much, they were great voices to listen to. Lovely.

I found the finale of the movie to be a major disappointment. The last half hour absolutely dragged, and the finale just didn't work out the way I would have liked. But I'm a romantic at heart, and although I draw the line at Sam & Deirdre running across a meadow with a blue sky, all alone in the world, and into each others arms, I would have liked a happy ending. And then I watched the alternative ending featured on the DVD (no TRAILER?! Sacriledge!), and was even more disappointed. I ended up wishing I'd not bothered watching the alternative ending, cos it was even more disappointing than the original in the movie! I want a happy ending please.

This is a good movie if you want a fast action film with lots of twists & turns, and stunning car chase sequences, which will take your breath away. For me, the finale lowered my rating. Boo. But it's very watchable. Get it. Or get the special edition.",1099094400,9,3838,4.4714285714285715
149583,5,079284209X,"This movie rightfully goes into the roster of classic spy flicks, like NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, DAY OF THE JACKAL, and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.

Written by David Mamet (see the 2004 Val Kilmer movie SPARTAN, which Mamet wrote and directed), this is a very understated spy thriller that has great car chases, confused motivations, and cool explosions. It doesn't get any better than that. What really pulls it off, however, is a script that elegantly reflects a sort of post-COLD WAR vacuum in the intelligence world, a situation that the movie has as parallel to the collapsing feudal order in medieval Japan, when wandering ronin samurai moved fluidly in a disintegrating social order (see Kurosawa's YOJIMBO).

There are two car chases in this film that are unbelievable. The direction is just fantastic. The character development--particularly of the protaganist ""Sam"" and Reno's ""Vincent""--is also superb. The reality of the events is shown in the vulnerability DeNiro's character exhibits. Sort of an anti-Rambo.

Even the music is subtle and well done, enhancing the murkiness of the plot. A really elegant film; very well-edited. I rarely give five star reviews for movies, but this is easily one of my favorite movies that I return to again and again.",1093219200,15,1278,5.164251207729468
149584,5,079284209X,"This 1998 spy-thriller from the late John Frankenheimer more than makes up for the current crop of spy-thrillers to come out of Hollywood: The Sum of All Fears, The Bourne Identity and The Recruit to name a few. The plot is straighforward enough for even the most slow audience to follow. Out of work former covert operatives hire themselves out to the highest bidder to acquire an item other parties are intent on acquiring themselves. The title comes from the Japanese word describing masterless samurai who have become lost and hire themselves out as brigands, mercenaries, etc...

Robert DeNiro's work as the lead is exemplary and shows why he's considered one of the best actors of the last 30 years. His portrayal of his character is understated when compared to his more notable roles. The other stand out in Ronin is French-actor Jean Reno. The professional relationship between DeNiro's and Reno's characters help pull together the rest of the cast and the rest did a very good job with the parts they were given. Even Sean Bean's small time onscreen is time well spent.

The other thing that I must point out as a plus about this film is Frankenheimer's work on shooting the film's many car chase sequence. Instead of relying on lots of explosions, FX-work and over-the-top stunt work, Frankenheimer's car chase scenes has the look of realism that is rare in many action-films these days.

Naturally: lead is flying, the tires are burned by former Formula 1 drivers, and the cast proves to be an ensemble that could light up more than one firmament. A recipe for cashing-in -- one could say -- but rarely a recipe for an instant classic. Ronin, however, just clicks. Clicks as Rubik's cube would and pulls us into a ninety-degree spin and onward to enchantment and an immense adrenaline rush. Why? Because it treads on irresistible subjects of solitude, camaraderie, love and betrayal -- here all served on the palette of the post-cold-war games -- and does so with a seductive flair. From the first group scene in a decrepit Montmartre bar, we are reminded that people often need to be distrustful in order to survive and that the sinister in life might be only an inch away. John Frenkenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate) captures that exceptionally well and leaves little to chance: the careful selection of actors, locations and camera movements solidifies this movie. The story never falters, even though the main price and the stated opposition are both rather enigmatic. The dialogues between Sam (Robert De Niro) and Vincent (Jean Reno) are lean and unforgettable: ""whenever there is doubt, there is no doubt...that's the first thing they teach you."" A propos teaching, watching the movie with the director's commentary is an eye-opener and it should be a treat for those who make or aspire to make motion pictures. The slick soundtrack, the use of blue lens and the novel fonts used in the credits frame it well. Ronin is a delight.

149619,5,079284209X,"""Ronin"" is an incredibly rare film these days, a white-knuckle action ride that makes you think, and doesn't insult your intelligence. The plot is deceptively simple; a group of mercenaries, the Ronin of the title, are brought together in Paris (France) by an Irish terrorist to acquire a particular case from a shadowy group who are willing to sell it to the highest bidder, including the Russian Mafia.
Each member of the group has a particular specialty, weapons, driving, IT, intelligence gathering etc, and has been hand picked for this one job. Information is passed to the group on an extraordinarily strict ""need to know"" basis, and attempts by one particular member of the group to find out what's actually inside the case, the type that ice skaters keep their skates in, and for which they could lose their lives, are continuously frustrated by this restriction. Never-the-less, plans are made and put into effect, but you know what they say about the ""Best laid plans of Mice and Men?"" Mayhem, double, triple and seemingly quadruple crosses ensue as the whole operation falls victim to Murphy's Law with a vengeance... ""Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong!""
Although Robert DeNiro is the nominal star, this is a superb ensemble cast, each one note-perfect in their role. The planners of the operation are ""Deirdre"" and ""Seamus,"" played by Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce respectively. McElhone positively glows in the role of the contact and go-between, and viewers who will most recently have seen Pryce as ""Governor Swann"" in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may be surprised by his performance here, but you may also remember him as ""Cardinal Houseman"" in ""Stigmata,"" not exactly a good-guy!
""Gregor"" the IT guy, played by Stellan Skarsgard, ""Spence"" the weapons man, played by Sean Bean, and ""Larry"" the driver, played by Skipp Sudduth, are three vital parts of the team. But it's ""Sam"" the ex Intelligence Operative, played by DeNiro, and ""Vincent"" the ""supplies manager,"" played by Jean Reno, who hold your attention... and no wonder!!! DeNiro and Reno are superb in their portrayal of two world-weary men who have paid a heavy price for the lives they've lead in the shadows. Their characters strike up an unlikely friendship almost immediately, and there's a real chemistry between the two of them up on the screen that really shows through; the two of them, I think, surpassing their performances in ""Heat"" and ""Leon"" respectively.
There are three further ""stars"" of the film that also deserve the highest praise, the tight and economical script, the gritty European locations, primarily Nice and Paris, and two magnificent car chases. One of these is staged in the twisting, incredibly narrow back streets of Paris, and then down into it's claustrophobic underpasses (tunnels) - although NOT the one in which Princess Diana was killed - at times AGAINST the flow of traffic! These are quite possibly the greatest car chases ever committed to celluloid, incredible adrenaline charged, white-knuckle rides with not a single CGI shot in the lot. These were filmed for real, and some of the actors in the cars were genuinely afraid as they flew through the constricted streets at speeds approaching 100mph!!!
There's also an ""Alternate Ending"" that is superb, explains what happens to one of the main characters, and is Frankenheimer's preferred resolution to the story. Unfortunately the preview audiences hated it - too downbeat - and so we have the ""Theatrical Release"" ending... take a look and make up your own mind, I just wish they could have ""branched"" it seamlessly into the film. All in all this is an excellent and intelligent thriller, one I would definitely put in the same class as the two ""French Connections,"" and ""Heat.""
And finally we come to the question of... ""WHAT'S IN THE CASE?""
One of the main criticisms of the film, both when it was released and in some of these reviews, is that ""What's in the case"" was never fully explained. What follows is MY interpretation... so please don't read any further if you haven't seen the film yet and don't want a major plot-spoiler revealed, but DO come back after you've watched the film and see if your interpretation agrees with my own!
Both Deirdre and Seamus are Irish terrorists, and the film is set during the run-up to the current cease-fire between the IRA and the British government. At the very end of the film, and within days of the death of Seamus and the recovery of the case, we hear a BBC news broadcast saying that the cease-fire is now in effect, and that Seamus was a rogue element within the Organization. So, what could fit inside a skater's case that would make an isolated fanatical terrorist not only be willing to double-cross his own people, but also go up against the Russian Mob? Gold? Diamonds? Counterfeit currency? An as-yet unseen Paris Hilton vid?! No, in my opinion the case contains a ""Suitcase Nuke"" that Seamus was probably planning to detonate outside Buckingham Palace!

The unique element is the band of mercenaries who cannot trust each other long enough to complete their mission. The cast is great: De Niro and Jonathan Pryce are Mamet veterans. Jean Reno is quite at home playing the Jean Reno character. Natasha McElhone is painfully beautiful, and one of the most capable actresses working today. She more than holds her own with the boys.

Oh, did I mention it has a car chase or two?
As car chases go, I always considered the best to be The French Connection and Bullitt, but I think Ronin takes the crown. Part of it is the European setting, where everything is smaller, tighter, and just magnified. The other component is the camera-work, which puts you right in the action. You feel like you're part of the chase, not just a bystander about to be run over.
I think this film is one of those easily overlooked gems that you should go out and watch immediately!

149623,4,079284209X,"This is a gritty, cold war drama without the cold war. The old pro at this sort of thing, John Frankenheimer, does it up right with this extremely well done film. This is the world of men with guns and cars, and Frankenheimer really excels at portraying this dangerous culture that exists right beneath the one you and I live in. The plot is perfect: There exists a case that everyone must have: the French, the Russians, and the IRA. The Irish put together a team of highly trained, out-of-work and somewhat tainted international professionals (thus the title of the film) to get it. Simple as that. Everyone chases the case, killing and double crossing all the way. This is a movie filled with men creeping in and out of shadows, walking like small swat teams through crowds of normal people, and coming together often in very realistic gun battles. In other words, just what the doctor ordered after your girlfriend sweet talks you into watching Titanic or some Merchant Ivory snooze fest one more goddamn time.
The DVD insert explains how Frankenheimer went to great lengths to assure realism in this movie, and it shows. Everything is stark and nearly sepia colored, the streets of Paris (where the movie begins) resemble an open, dripping sewer. Also, the car chase scene is an actual tire-squealing, engine-overdriving, steel crunching car chase  without digital help or ridiculous comic book stunts. Just high-performance cars tearing through the streets with muscular precision. This car chase will probably be remembered in the same class as the classic car romp in Bullett (though I have to say, I still prefer Steve McQueen behind the wheel of that extremely buffed GT Mustang).
The tone is real, and the cast is well chosen: De Niro, of course, is always the seasoned pro, just like the character, Sam, he plays in the film. The scene where he calls out Spence (Sean Bean) is a whole lot of fun. Spence is a one of the professionals contracted for the job, and he and Sam don't get along from the get-go. You see it coming from the beginning, and when it comes it doesnt disappoint. Jonathan Pryce is a scary surprise as the nearly demented, lethal IRA rouge, Seamus; and Jean Reno (Vincent) is so completely word-weary and French, you sense that after he killed you he would feel very sad about it.
Im not sure why, but this movie really improves with second or third viewings. Perhaps it is the statuesque, ice-melting presence of Katarina Witt, who has a small but important part in the film as a, well, statuesque, ice-melting Russian figure skater.

Ronin has classic DeNiro, a sterling international cast, great scenery, two absolutely astonishing chase scenes through the narrow busy streets, over the winding roads, into the tunnels, and in the wrong-direction on a multi-lane highway of several French cities where the actors were actually in the cars traveling in excess of 100+ mph being driven from the passenger-side controls (if you think American-made cars) by top race drivers and talented stunt men, but filmed to look as if the stars were driving. In fact, some of the driving was done by Skipp Sudduth (Sully in TV's 'Third Watch').  Add explicit blow-by-blow commentary by director John Frankenheimer including a description of exactly how these real-life, no film-magic, chase scenes where filmed in intricate detail and you've got yourself a breath-taking tour of France from a vantage point most of us could never hope to experience.

149652,5,079284209X,"This is an absolutely AWESOME movie!  I can't emphasize that enough - this is one of the best suspense thrillers you're likely to see anytime soon.  Though it was made in the 1990s, it recalls the glory days of the 1970s thrillers and is in fact directed by one of that genre's masters, John Frankenheimer.  He has made some excellent films, including the Manchurian Candidate and The French Connection II (often overshadowed by the original but showcasing an even better performance by Gene Hackman).
You know Ronin will be good with this director at the helm.  And check out the rest of the pedigree - Robert de Niro (Raging Bull, Godfather 2), Jean Reno (Leon - now this is also a great film but catch the European version if you can), Johnathan Pryce (Evita, Tomorrow Never Dies), and Sean Bean (superb as the tragic Boromir in Fellowship of the Ring).  With this cast and crew alone, the film will already be superb.  In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a planned heist to acquire a briefcase with some top secret...something or other inside.  But wait - there's more!  It's filled with clandestine meetings, shadowy locations, gun fights, betrayals, revenge, car chases, murder, etc.
All good spy suspense thrillers are filmed in Europe, and this is no exception.  It takes advantage of many wonderful locales for its scenes.  The gun fights are expertly photographed and edited for maximal excitement and are quite brutal and unforgiving.  Yet the film always maintains an aura of realism about it - no Mission Impossible 2 gun ballets but just realistic and often painful and bloody gun fights.  No one is invulnerable to bullets, which makes the film quite gruesome at times.  Ironically, the most squeamish moment is not a gunfight but rather is an impromptu surgery when an injured character guides another character to help fish a bullet out of his body.
But wait, there's more!  You know how everyone says Steve McQueen's Bullitt has the best movie car chase ever?  Well, it's darn good, but the first car chase in Ronin comes VERY close to matching the intensity, raw power, merciless editing, and excitement of Bullitt's chase.  Plus, the car chase starts and ends with a vicious gunfight.  Darn good stuff.  But WAIT - if you thought the first car chase was great, wait until you see the SECOND car chase, which gets my award for the BEST movie car chase of all time.  Basically, Robert de Niro is chasing someone else in a car, and they drive through heavily congested streets and tunnels and sidewalks and even in ONCOMING traffic.  The way it's filmed and edited makes the entire chase seem extremely realistic and DANGEROUS (unlike the bland Hollywood car chases you always see) and unsurpassed in its virtuosity.  By the second half of this masterpiece of a car chase, if your jaw hasn't dropped in amazement, you're probably blind.
But WAIT - there's more!  Katarina Witt, that's right, the Olympic champion, has nice role in this film as a Russian ice skating champ.  There's one simple scene when she steps out of a car, and she looks SO darling and beautiful your heart will melt.  But my favorite spot of the entire film comes in the middle of her skating program near the finale.  It's short, only a couple of seconds long, but it's SO unexpected during this graceful beautiful performance that it leaves quite an impact; I won't reveal it but you'll know it when you see it.
I could go on, but you get the picture.  FIVE STARS!  ABSOLUTELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1034985600,5,3491,4.765391014975042
149653,5,079284209X,"In these days of such overdone action movies like M:I-2, XXX, World is Not Enough, and Fast and the Furious, it's so refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't need CGI or overblown explosions every 5 seconds to make it exciting.
DeNiro, in his last great role, plays Sam, a mysterious ex-CIA agent (or so he says) who joins a group of mysterious international gunslingers to retrieve an equally mysterious briefcase for a mysterious boss.  Supported by an excellent supporting cast including Jean Reno and Sean Bean, these five mercenaries, or Ronin, literally wage a small war across southern France.  It's almost like an all-action interpretation of Reservoir Dogs- they are comlete strangers, they don't know who they're working for, and they are motivated only by money.
Along the way, there are twists and turns but unlike most movies, these twists are here for a reason.  They make sense and actually aid the story instead of bog it down.
So we have shady characters, none of whom are real nice angels, a great plot, and a brilliant set-up.  What about the action?  Well if you want to experience the most realistic shoot outs and car chases ever on film, then you'll be in heaven.  From the firefight/getaway under the bridge to the spectacular ambush in the city of Nice to the final harrowing car chase throughout Paris, every shot fired creates a hole in something, and every character actually aims to put down his opponent.  Amazingly, though these scenes are incredibly realistic, they are never boring.
Few action movies can qualify as brilliant, but Frankenheimer's Ronin surely does.  It's like no other action movie you've ever seen, and if Michael Bay and John Woo keep making movies, you probably never will for a long time.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie- it's intelligent and intense.
It's unforunate that Frankenheimer died recently, because if there's one movie that deserves a sequel, this is it; I'd love to see what happens to the survivors of this film.  Odds are that this will never happen.",1033084800,,2033,4.866666666666666

This DVD is an extremely high-quality product.  My personal ratings would be Picture = 4.5 and Sound = 5.0.  There is a bit of grain and some tiny ""flecks"" but overall the picture is very, very clean.
Photography is fantastic especially during the car chase scenes.  Despite all the action, most of the shots are smooth and I cannot figure out how the filmmakers did that.
Music and sound is the real gem here and surround-sound is used effectively.  The soundtrack is impressive as the music seems to be based on drumming and interesting drum patterns.  There are plenty of low frequencies used and some action punctuations that will test your woofer for sure.  Classical music standards are also used at times (for background) and sound wonderful.

149697,4,079284209X,"Ronin, directed by John Frankenheimer, may not be his best movie, but it still delivers the action that most people today would want in a movie like this.
Ronin's plot is very simple. It's basically about a group of mercenaries that are being paid to find a case. That's about it. There are many plot twists and turns as the loyalty of some of the mercenaries turns from good to bad.
The action is well filmed. There are 2 very exciting car chases and numerous shootouts throughout the movie. There is also a lot of different cities and towns (all in France) that the mercenaries travel to. So by the end of the movie, it'll feel like you've just watched a huge 3-hour epic when you've only watched a 2-hour movie.
The acting is great. Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Jonathan Pryce, Stellan Skarsgard, and Sean Bean all give outstanding performances. The DVD is OK. It has a nice commentary by John Frankenheimer, an alternate ending, (which isn't that different from the original ending.) and a little booklet that chronicles the making of the film.

149699,3,079284209X,"In ancient Japan, a ronin was a samurai warrior whose master had been killed in disgrace. When this happened, the ronin lost his reason for being a soldier and often began a career as a hired assassin or mercenary. This bit of history acts as a metaphor for the characters in the film, Ronin.
Robert de Niro is Sam, a middle-aged former CIA agent who, claiming to be broke, takes a job with a mysterious group in France. In Paris he meets the rest of the team. They include Vincent [Jean Reno], an ex French espionage agent, and Diedre [Natascha McElhone], who is in charge of the group and who was probably a major player in the IRA. The mission is to steal a package from another group, which is apparently manned with other former agents. The metaphor quickly begins to unfold. Like those ancient ronins, these people were fighters in causes that have ceased to exist. The difference is that their masters were political ones. They now double-cross and double deal for no noble purpose.
In true thriller style, neither we nor the gang members are privy to the contents of this package. The contents become almost beside the point, as we watch these cynical, disenchanted characters chase after something they are willing to kill for. It's what they were trained to do, and that's what they do, even now that their reasons are vague, if not nonexistent.
There are many good things about Ronin. I do not entirely agree with the general critical consensus that this is a grand return to days of stylish, inventive movie thrillers. True, there is no reliance on computerized special effects. It does contain two of the most spectacular car chases ever put on film. De Niro, as can be expected, is head and shoulders above the average modern anti-hero. But hasn't he always been better? Currently, as shown by him in Wag the Dog, Jackie Brown and this movie, he is in his deeply cynical phase. Expect him to mellow out in a few years.
It is great to see 69-year old director John Frankenheimer back in the genre that made him famous. Two of his movies, The Manchurian Candidate [1962] and Seconds [1966], are two of the greatest thrillers ever made. But Ronin, while retaining essence of his earlier work, displays some unpleasant modern traits. Traditionally, the great car chases, as well as those on foot, have taken place in crowded cities or on busy highways. This heightens the suspense. The prototype of the modern chase was created in a brilliant 1969 film called Bullet. In it, cars careened around in a most spectacular setting - the streets of San Francisco. The ones in Ronin take place in the twisting streets of European cities, but unlike their predecessors, Ronin's characters manage to kill a number of innocent bystanders in the process. In real life, that's exactly what would happen, but this realistic approach backfires. I was disturbed by the fact that none of these deaths were ever referred to either in the film or by anyone I know who saw it. Movies about morally corrupt characters are acceptable, but it seems to me that some film makers today assume the audience is also corrupt. Surely, that's a fallacy on their part.",1017187200,2,3147,4.723636363636364

149701,3,079284209X,"You'd think the combination of Robert DeNiro and action/thriller director John Frankenheimer (""Grand Prix,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate"") would give audiences a thrill ride to remember. Unfortunately, that's not the case.
A potentially intriguing idea falls short of real satisfaction. In the post Cold War era, former agents, smugglers, spies, mercenaries and the like stay in business by selling their services to anyone who needs a job done discreetly and quietly-with no questions asked. Like the masterless samurai of old (hence the title), these individuals are men and women without a country, with no ties and often no loyalties. A loose group of mercenaries--American, Irish, French, etc--is offered substantial money to transport a briefcase--contents unknown--to a client. But other seek to capture the briefcase, and there may be treachery in the group's midst.
There's really no character development, mostly short snippets of personal information that's supposed to pass for substance and motivation (although money motivates them all), and there's not much story to fill the spaces between some truly hair-raising and dynamic car chases (a Frankenheimer specialty; see ""Grand Prix""). The performances aren't bad, with DeNiro making his character moderately interesting. The always welcome (and often underused and underrated) French actor Jean Reno provides the best performance, giving his character a certain cocky confidence. A few other action segments may hold a viewer's interest, and there are a couple of twists near the end. (Sharp observors may see them coming, though.) But there's so little else to hold the film together that one may become bored waiting for the next chase or shootout.
Ultimately, ""Ronin"" disappoints, though there's enough
action and intrigue to provide decent entertainment. The chases alone--especially the one on the narrow mountain road--are worth the price of the movie--some stunt coordinator certainly earned his pay! See also Luc Besson's ""The Professional,"" and fans of ""Ronin"" may also like ""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection,"" both known for action, intrigue, and fantastic chases.",1013126400,,2160,5.608562691131499
149702,5,079284209X,"I didn't think I would like this flick but after watching it once, I was hooked. It's a good story of people whose lives were spent fighting for idealogies that no longer exist. How do they fill the void? Money, danger, the usual opiates of society.
De Niro plays a member of a ragtag group of former spies, etc. who are hired by an Irish group to steal a briefcase. No one knows what is in it, and honestly no one cares. De Niro is excellent, as in everything he does, and believable as an ex-CIA burned out hasbeen.
The action is terrific, with some of the best driving sequences I've seen. Double-crossing and double-double crossing is the rule of the day. Eventually, it turns out that De Niro is actually after the head of the Irish group, a known terrorist, who is a major impediment to peace talks in N. Ireland. At the end of the flick, a radio announcer comments that with the recent death of this leader, peace is assured in Ireland after centuries of fighting. This answers the question of whether everything was worth it.
The DVD shows an alternative ending that is grimmer and probably more realistic. But sometimes, too much realism [hurts].

149703,2,079284209X,"'Ronin' is a perpetuum mobile of action set-pieces, pursuit and flight, by car or on foot.  Fans were delighted that in an age of limitless technological gadgetry, the tough, narrow, 70s-style crime thriller could still find a place, where speeding cars genuinely terrorised crowded streets, where market barrows were set up to be knocked down, where ancient monuments and picturesque old lanes gave a Hitchcockian frisson to the various chases.  The dank and dark atmosphere, the shorthand psychology, the terse dialogue and tough poses all added to a nostaliga of integrity harking bak to 'Bullit' and 'The French Connection'.  It didn't seem to matter that the various plot points necessary to drive and tidy up the plot were preposterously contrived; that the backdrop of Russians and rogue-IRA operatives was closer to cartoon than James Bond ever was; that grimaces and twitches were substituted for actual acting (with the honorable eception of Jonathan Pryce who, despite borrowing his Irish accent from Julia Roberts, has a genius moment when long-wished for success is interrupted).
Not only does the film recall 'classic' 70s policiers, but also the film that influenced them, Melville's 'Le Samourai', as it transposes Japanese warrior culture to pastiche film noir.  Here, however, the Orientalism seems tacked on, the idea of 'masterless samurai' a nonsense not fully worked out in its 'modernised' context, and 'explained' by one silly dialogue scene between De Niro and an againg Matt Groening-lookalike, which suggests the screenwriters weren't totally convinced either.  No, it is Melville's master whose spirit drives this film, John Huston: 'Ronin' is a study in male endeavour, female treachery and the elevation of failure to a moral code.

149706,5,079284209X,"John Frankenheimer didn't have a lot of credibility in his last few years. His final film was the rather crap Reindeer Games, with Ben Affleck, and in 1996 he gave us the utterly terrible Island Of Doctor Moreau. However, he did do Ronin in 1998, which makes up for absolutely everything.

It is a detachment from glossy, MTV-directed, Hollywood action movies. If you want trash, like Bad Boys 2, then this isn't for you. Ronin returns to the gritty, rustic and deadly serious actioners of the Seventies, much like Frankenheimer's own French Connection 2.

The title refers to Samurai warriors in ancient Japan who were left with no cause, or purpose, if their master was killed. They'd roam the countryside, pretending to be thieves, beggars, even madmen and hiring their skills out to the highest bidder. Much like the lost, wandering freelancers that make up our cast of characters.

Robert De Niro is Sam, an ex-CIA agent (or is he?), who bands together with a ragtag group of similar ex-spies for a ""no questions asked"" job with what appears to be the IRA. First we have Vincent (the wonderful Jean Reno), as a French agent who knows where to find just about anything you want. Spence (Sean Bean) is a gung-ho SAS dropout who is waaaaay out of his depth and ends up jeopardizing the whole mission. Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard), an ex-KGB spy who knows his gadgets and another American called Larry (who is rather disposable). All of these men are led by Deirdre (Natascha McElhone), a young Irish woman who answers to Seamus O'Rourke (Jonathan Price), an IRA boss who is in a lot of trouble with his superiors.

Still with me? No? Well I'm gonna continue anyway. The group's mission is to steal a metallic briefcase from the Russian Mafia. The contents of this case are a mystery; all we know is that a lot of people are willing to pay mucho plento to get their hands on it.

As if the set-up wasn't tenuous enough, there is immediately too much suspicion within the group to bear. And the already complicated plot is thrown into endless chaos as double-crosses, double-double-crosses, secrets and lies screw things up in a big, big way.

It sounds tough going, but it's not really. I'll admit I didn't really like Ronin when I first saw it (or the second or third for that matter), but it's one of those movies that creeps back on you. Frankenheimer's direction is so flawless and masterful that every frame of every scene flows effortlessly The acting is so well rehearsed and the cast so well chosen that even in every gesture, idiosyncrasy and subtle glance you can read into the characters' hidden motives. It takes a good number of viewings to decipher Ronin, but when the story is this well done, who cares? Since its release there have been few action films that have come close to its intensity. Some, like Bourne Identity/Supremacy try to emulate its bleak tone, but don't match up. Supremacy has a car chase that was desperate to beat Ronin's, but is far too flashy.

That's also the ace up it's sleeve. About 80 minutes into the film, the second car chase is a juggernaut of film-making. Never before and probably never again for a long, long time, has there been a car chase so completely mental. No Michael Bay 1000 cuts a second, no slow-motion, no stunts silhouetted against the sunset, just sheer, relentless adrenaline, as DeNiro and Reno tear up the streets of Paris. It's the centerpiece of the movie and a perfect example of what REAL action film-making is.

Elia Cmiral's score is the other utterly perfect aspect of the movie. Simultaneously lonely, seductive and mysterious, it surely is one of the best themes ever and anyone with sense would go out and buy the soundtrack CD right away.

Ronin is perfection from beginning to end, from Frankenheimer's strong, imposing direction to David Mamet's script, riddled with cryptic dialogue and double-meanings.

No one can deny Ronin's importance as a real action picture. No one can watch crap like xXx, or 6 Fast 6 Furious, and claim Ronin to be a bad movie. It has enough, maybe too much, integrity and intelligence to shame anything that comes even halfway close. If you're sick of action flicks, or films in general, where the audience just sits there passively and is fed information, then Ronin is the cure.

It may sound like a bizarre comparison, but it's on par with Lost Highway, as one of those movies you have to figure out in your own damn time.

The Blu Ray looks merely okay with a 1080p transfer.

In most car chases they drive slow and use tricks to make it seem more dramatic, or everything is so well choreographed that it's just unbelievable.  But in Ronin they did it right.  They drove real cars at real speeds on real roads (narrow ones at that), and half the time you are certain they are going to wreck.

The details are purposefully vague (what is in the suitcase?? why do the Russians want it?? why do the Irish want it??), but certain points are left unexplained to convey the mercenary feeling. The movie is definitely classy, with a pleasant European atmosphere to it. John Frankenhemier did a great job of making a smart movie. It is heavy on action, but smart enough that it cannot be categorized with braincell-lite action movies. Top-notch acting, especially from De Niro and Jean Reno. They were both very likable and intelligent characters, but were not afraid to get their hands dirty (especially De Niro). Sean Bean also was very good as the clueless chump.  And if you like car chases, this is the movie for you. Where else can you see fast European cars speeding down the opposite side of the highway (or whatever they call it in Europe)? Also, the action was very believable. I especially enjoyed how they used a wide variety of modern-day weapons and gadgets to achieve their objectives (where can I get a traffic light changer?).

The story is an inventory of cliches and formulas. As for the car chase, I was not impressed. To be fair, it may have been better on a full movie screen in a real theater.

149735,4,079284209X,"I really like this movie.  Ronin is about a group of spies/mercenaries who are seeking work in the post-Cold War world.  Robert Deniro plays Sam, an American who is clearly an experienced player in the espionage world.  Sam gets hired by Deirdre, an attractive Irish woman who is looking for a team of mercenaries to steal a mysterious brief case.  Deirdre is played by Natascha McElhone.  There are also excellent supporting performances by Jean Reno, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Price.  The entire plot is shrouded in mystery as none of the mercenaries really know who they can trust.  However, this is more than a cloak & dagger film but an action film as well.  The action sequences are amazingly well done.  This movie may contain the best car chase ever captured on film.  It should be noted that all of the chase sequences were filmed with actual cars, with no computer touch ups.  The action is hard core and gritty.  Innocent bystanders are often caught in the fray.  The only thing this film lacks is a strong love story or any sort of graphic sex.  The focus is more on the goals of the mercenaries and the relationships of these hardened men.  However, it should be noted that Katarina Witt does have a small part.  The movie itself is a smart thriller with a gritty edge.  It is certainly a far cry from a James Bond film.
The DVD production is excellent.  The print is relatively clean and I didn't really notice any speckling.  Much of the movie is in the shadows and the dark colors are contrasted well.  I didn't notice any image wash in the shadows.  The sound is nice and full, especially in the action sequences.  The only possible shortcoming of the DVD production is the lack of extras.  There is a director's commentary and an alternative ending.  The alternative ending is insightful, but you'll certainly realize why they cut it from the movie.  I would've loved to see some other deleted scenes or perhaps some comments from the actors.  I probably would've given this production 5 stars if there had just been a few more extras.
On a personal note, I first saw this movie on pan & scan video tape.  A friend of mine, who had seen it in the theater, raved about the action sequences.  I enjoyed the film on VHS but couldn't understand the hype.  I understand it now.  This movie looks completely different in wide screen format and I can't say enough about what the wide screen DVD adds from the pan & scan production.  However, it should be noted that this DVD contains both a pan & scan and widescreen version on alternate sides of the disk. If you're into espionage/noir type films, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",993340800,6,2645,4.587606837606837
149736,5,079284209X,"Having recently seen and written an Amazon.com review for ""Swordfish"", it got into my mind to take another look at ""Ronin"", the 1998 action/intrigue drama cut from the same cloth as the recent Travolta film.
Directed by John Frankenheimer and written by JD Zeik and (under a pseudonym) David Mamet, ""Ronin"" is the epitome of filmmaking done correctly, combining smart direction, a well-crafted script, and first-rate actors.  It is a spy thriller on par with the great genre films of the 60's and an equal to the best of the James Bond series.  While only modestly successful at the box office upon its release, word of mouth has garnered this film a well-deserved cult following.
The film starts in the Alistair MacLean tradition, with a group of professionals (in this case mercenaries with various skills), none of whom know each other, meeting with a client who has a job for them to do.  Ronin is a Japanese term for a samurai without a master, the ultimate disgrace for a warrior.  The Ronin in this film, taking place in modern day France, are presumably agents without governments either because of their own hidden failures or perhaps because the end of the Cold War leaves them with a bit of a shallow resume for normal forms of employment.  Thus, men and women like this find themselves forced into jobs like the one that drives the film, with strangers they don't know, for reasons they will never be told, and only the promise of enough pay for them to subsist on until the next job comes along.
The beauty of the ""Ronin"" script is that very little (if any) light is shed into the backgrounds of the characters involved.  It is clear that the past is done with these characters, so they are blank slates for the audience, who can paint their opinions with their observations and insights as the film moves along.  Eschewing the traditional path of developing characters through exposition, Mamet and Zeik craft the plot so that the main arc of the story itself reveals understanding enough for the characters.  There is a plot to ""Ronin"", a simple McGuffin tale of desired prizes and double-crosses, but the movie isn't about that.  The theme of ""Ronin"" is inspired by more than just the Japanese term.  It is a descendant of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", where Toshiro Mifune's Sanjuro throws a stick on the ground as a way to decide which direction he will go.  That way will find him great adventure and danger but, in the end, there will just be another crossroads and another stick.  ""Ronin"" is a modern-day meditation on the same type of figure.
Frankenheimer directs it all with great verve and panache, including a number of car chase sequences that leave the viewer with mouth agape.  Rounding out the supreme professionalism of the film is one of the best ensembles to ever grace the genre.  Leading the pack is Robert DeNiro as ""Sam"", and accompanied by an international who's who including Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgrd, Jonathan Pryce, and Michael Lonsdale.  With all the pieces in place, ""Ronin"" is both a great film and a classic of the genre.  Highly recommended.",992217600,2,3082,4.775894538606403

149758,5,079284209X,"Frankenheimer reminds us why he is the master of filming car chases.  This movie was only a moderate hit in theaters, but if you have a large-screen TV and a good sound system you will reap the rewards of this film's action scenes at home.  This is one of the few intelligent espionage thrillers of recent years.  But the absolute highlight of this DVD is Frankenheimer's running audio commentary.  He launches into exquisite detail about the production of this film, and it is all interesting.  The man really loves his high performance cars and drivers!  DeNiro, as usual, is perfect.  Watch for a small but pivotal role by Jan Triska, previously seen on American screens as the would-be assassin in Milos Forman's ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt.""  Largely unknown to American audiences, Triska is regarded as the Lawrence Olivier of Czhekoslovakian stage and screen.  Yes, I know I misspelled Czhekosl-, er... Chzeck-, Checkosl-, oh, whatever.  Let's see YOU do it without looking it up.

****  November 2010 edit:  As of this writing the Blu-ray edition of this film, while reasonably priced, does NOT include the bonus features that came with the DVD releases.  There is no alternate ending and, most criminally, no director's commentary.  John Frankenheimer's director commentary on the DVD is a ""must-hear"" commentary.  It is one of the better director commentaries on the market.  It is a shame that the studio that released the Blu-ray wouldn't pony up the bucks to import it (or any other bonus feature except a trailer) from the DVD.  This is not uncommmon, unfortunately.  The same thing has happened with a number of newly-issued  Blu-rays at bargain prices.  ""The Thing"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" suffered the same fate -- the Blu-ray has fewer features than the DVD.  I can think of a couple of reasons why the studio might make that decision, but at the end of the day it comes down to this: the studios don't even treat their own films with the same reverence that the customers do.

The international cast is top-notch with Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce.  The story takes place in France and provides a nice departure from most action movies that are dominated by American locations.
The mercenary team is DeNiro, Reno, Skarsgard and Bean, ex-military or government employees who have been assembled though secret contacts to acquire the package for an organization with ties to the IRA.  The job is dangerous in that they must take the item from an organized crime element.  They are successful, but in the midst of the ambush operation, Skarsguard as the ex-KGB agent, suddenly makes off with the prize.  Several double-dealing events unfold and DeNiro and Reno soon find themselves alone as the only trusting partners in the ordeal, and begin digging up old government contacts to find their betrayers.  It's high adventure with plenty of fireworks and car chases, particularly the chase in Paris that's a white-knuckle ride when the pursuit goes against traffic on one of the major expressways.

149765,5,079284209X,"Ronin is one of the best action films out there and that has a lot to do with the intelligence and attention to detail that was involved with every element.
However, I only discovered my favorite feature of this DVD the other night when we realized we had never watched the Director's commentary.  John Frankenheimer delivered an incredibly informative narrative, really getting down to the nitty-gritty of technical aspects of creating a film.  He discussed film processing techniques, working with local governmental jurisdictions in France, specific editing and framing techniques, just to name a few. He also covered his overall vision for the movie and it was evident that this was a film in which he takes great pride.  These insights were not only incredibly engaging in the context of this particular film, but taught me new things about the nuts and bolts of the film industry.  Other reviewers have said that the DVD does not contain enough extra materials, but Frankenheimer's commentary was much more worth my time than any European trailer edits.
As for the film itself....The acting is crazy good (c'mon, DeNiro and Jean Reno!! not to mention everyone else on screen) The chase scenes are some of the best out there (though some of the tension is lost on viewers not aquainted with the ridiculously narrow streets of Europe). Also,unlike many other action movies, the plot is complex enough to keep my interest instead of only providing interludes between gunfire.

However, that said, I still think it's a wonderful film.  The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Robert De Niro himself, whose incredible talent and presence is finally showcased to some measure of justice (although in general, I continue to be depressed by his other sub-par projects, like Meet the Parents, but I digress).  The story is wonderful and sharp...the endless chess games and betrayals lend it a gritty, realistic feel that has won me over to spy movies in a way I didn't think could happen (the Bond series and Mission Impossible, the closest Hollywood parallels, are just plain intelligence-insulting).

149777,4,079284209X,"""An Anti-Action, anti-formula movie"" was my initial choice for a tag line for this review...but I wanted something more enticing! If you've gotten this far, you're probably looking for a little clarification. Here it is:
It is indeed rare to encounter a truly original element in any movie. Much rarer still, is to have such originality overlooked completely by the viewing public. When this occurs, it really upsets me. RONIN offers us just such an unheralded moment of cinematic history!
Initially curious to see what percent of Amazon reviewers had commented on the totally unique and unprecedented selection of a female driver, in what is, undoubtedly,the most REALISTIC cinema chase sequence of the past 20 years, systematically, I began scouring the reviews. What I discovered has not ceased to amaze me! I would like to share the results with you, and let you gauge your own reaction.
Out of the 212 reviews that were posted at the time, I carefully went over 70 of them! (About 1/3) Only ONE reviewer used a name clearly belonging to woman. Unfortunately, she restricted herself to only 15 or 20 words, so she really didn't end up saying much of anything! (Of course, there were perhaps 7 or 8 anonymous reviews.)
Of the 70 reviews, 50, or more, made reference to the chase scene .(Between 80 & 90 percent of those comments were basically positive.
Although Robert De Niro and Jean Reno were the only two actors in the film who definitely had more on-screen time than Natascha McElhone,(Dierdre, the chase car driver from HELL!)close to 20 reviewers commented on other actors, whose on-screen time wasn't half that of hers. Only 6 or 7 chose to mention her at all! Probably, more reviewers sited Katarina Witt's 3 or 4 minute cameo spot! (Of course, she was much more scantily clad than Ms. McElhone!)
Finally, out of 50, or so, who did talk about the chase scenes, ONLY ONE linked McElhone to them directly! Amazingly, paraphrasing here the reviewer's words, ""The car chase scenes are very authentic. (Except that Natascha McElhone looks like she has never driven fast in her life!)"" Well, all I can say is, after having screened the scene at least a dozen times, it seems to me that this reviewer was watching a different RONIN!
Some might argue that THELMA & LOUISE had car chases. These were all together different, because the movie revolved entirely around its title characters. In RONIN, nobody seems to make a big deal out of the fact, and it is actually Dierdre's boss who pointedly barks at her, ""YOU DRIVE!""
Is there a lesson to be learned here? Apparently, all this tends to bear out the title of this review...""Clothed women in Action films are invisible to male viewers!"" Sad, because RONIN has a lot more to offer than just the chase scenes. It pays yet another subtle tribute to the prowess of women, when an ex-East German operative (Stellan Skarsgaerd) says, ""I've hired the very best sniper assassin...She never misses!""
More than anything else, RONIN provides an utterly believable inside-track on the post-Cold War mercenary and the shadowy, detached world he inhabits, reminiscent of the insider's glimpse of real-world spies offered in the classic, The SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD.
If it's John Woo style Action films that make your day...You'll probably find RONIN much too realistic, too cerebral, too noir and too explosionless for your tastes! On the other hand, if you like your Action movies well grounded in reality, RONIN is a near classic, anti-action, anti-formula film, with a most refreshing European aftertaste, that you will find quite engrossing and enjoyable!",971481600,3,3608,4.916393442622951

Great action sequences (including two of the best car chases in film), a solid plot, and outstanding acting by Robert De Niro,  Jean Reno, and Jonathan Pryce made this movie my favorite.  I have  personally seen Ronin seven times, and each time I am amazed by the quality  of the film.
There's more to this movie than the action sequences, and it  recalls the days when action movies were not just pure action all the time.  When I first saw the samurai minature sequence, I thought it was uncessary  and boring, but after time, I have come to think it an interesting and  important part of the story.  Some people might find Ronin a bit boring at  times, but it has a strong plotline that is unpredicatble, and just enough  action without going overboard.
This DVD doesn't have many extra features  at all, although I absolutely loved the director's commentary.  Otherwise,  it's sorely lacking in features, despite the alternate ending.  I wish that  MGM would have released this as a special edition - it would have been my  favorite DVD of all time - still, I highly recommend it because Ronin is  such an awesome movie.",964483200,26,1215,4.537037037037037

149784,4,079284209X,"In the post cold war era, many government spooks became freelance or mercenary.  Five of these people find themselves in the employ of an Irish woman, who is reluctant to identify her principle partner.  The task is the  retrieval of a case, the contents of which are unknown to the team hired  for the job.  At least, most of the team doesn't know what is in the  case.
 The team quickly tests each other to see who each believes  they can trust, and who can be counted on.  All of their trusts and  concerns are put to the test when their job doesn't go as planed.
  Ronin was the best action movie of 1998.  It was suspenseful, had nice  scenery, and most admirably, it commonly obeyed the laws of physics.  For  the most part, things only exploded when acted upon by explosives;  People  dropped like a bag of potatoes when killed by gunfire;  With only one  exception, cars impacted allot without any random or unexplained  explosions.  I appreciate realism.  The acting was good, but it was  expected of the lineup.
 Robert De Niro (Academy Award Winner for  ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Godfather Part II"") plays an  American who needs the money from the job in question.  Jean Reno  (""Leon"" aka ""The Professional"", ""La Femme  Nikita"", ""Mission: Impossible"") plays a Frenchman who knows  who will keep him alive.  Stellan Skarsgard (""Good Will Hunting"",  ""Aberdeen"") plays an ex KGB electronics specialist.  Jonathan  Pryce (""Brazil"", Tomorrow Never Dies"", ""Something  Wicked This Way Comes"") plays an Irish nationalist who will do as much  as any other person to take possession of the case.
 The best factor  of this film is the tangled web created by so many parties with interest in  the case, what they do to protect themselves, and what they do to obtain  the case.  The movie is very careful to supply the audience with all of the  relevant information, and to withhold most of the irrelevant information.  The character development was somewhat simple, but as complicated as it  needed to be to support the complications in the story.  It kept me on the  edge of my seat when I saw it in the theaters, and it did a fair job when I  recently viewed it on DVD.
 There were a few shortcomings in this  movie.  It did not always avoid the spy movie clich&eacute;.  I felt that the car  chase in Paris went on far too long, and was very unoriginal.
8.5 on a  scale of 10.

With enough gadgets, cars, and guns to even make James Bond jealous, you definately won't be disappointed watching this one.  This movie doesn't  have a one track mind. It deftly mixes action, suspense, and even a little  romance and humor.  The plot isn't so confusing that you're completely left  out, but it also isn't so simple that you know how it turns out from the  start.  You must pay attention to the end of this movie.  The whole reason  for De Niro's character being part of the group attempting to recover  ""the case""  is revealed in a small snippet of dialogue that, if  you miss, will leave you clueless to the whole point of the film.

Ten or 15 minutes into i was like, ""hold on, there is a plot and I  missed the whole thing? ""  This flick goes from having no apparent  plot to assuming that you already know whats going on, but without telling  you what is going on.  Its one of those movies where you have to figure it  out by 'tough love.'  This is one of those movies where everyone turns on  everyone else, so it goes without saying the plot gets complicated and  convoluted and more or less altogether lost.  After Reno and DeNiro's boss  turns on them (thus leaving them obviously unemployed) why do they keep  going after the case?  What attachment do they have to it?  This doesn't  seem very logical considering they are hired mercanaries - when they don't  need to complete the job, you would think that they would not stay on it  without reason or pay.  There is also a tiny attempt at a love story here  but it is ultimately left stillborn and doesn't contribute anything.

149819,1,079284209X,"This movie had a topnotch cast, talent with the ability to make anything worthwhile, however this movie WAS NOT up to their usual standards as the overdone action scenes and confused plot made this potentially good movie a  real suckfest!
Why did I hate this movie, well thats easy, first off,  one of my absolute fave actors, the extremely talented Jean Reno was cast  as a 'bumboy' to Robert DeNiro (RDN), I mean he was suppose to be RDN  French equivalent, but what we got was a tragic waste of Jean Renos talent,  bascially he was a man who looked as confused as the storyline!
The  action scenes were terribly overdone, I have read other reviews saying the  car chases were the most exciting part in the entire film, which I  wholeheartedly disaggree with!  OVERKILL, COMPLETE AND UTTER OVERKILL, made  it more boring than anything else!  It felt as though the director or  writer new what a waste of time  they had created, that they decided to  give the audience something to disguise the mess they made in the first  place, however the Action scenes only highlighted what was so wrong about  this movie!
Their were some clever ideas dotted throughout Ronin, that  seemed to go somewhere but got lost as soon as the guns started firing, so  instead of 'Masterless Samurai's' we got hired guns running or driving  around a maze of streets and buildings shooting at each other to get a  rather simple prize, a few twists and double dealings are mixed in as well  to enlighten or confuse, take your pick!
No amount of Bandaid (a  small adhesive dressing) will ever make Ronin worthy of the actors who were  unfortunately associated with it.  AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COST, if you  want an exciting car chase scene then watch French Connection or The Blues  Brothers!  far more interesting and thrilling than this!",960681600,8,1816,4.682539682539683
149820,4,079284209X,"I loved the way there was no slow motion during the chase scenes. A common  problem with most hollywood car chases is that the action, for some weird  reason, is slowed down. In my opinion this takes away from the feeling of  speed. Ronin dos a great job in that it shows the action as it would appear  to those involved. And for once, a vegetable or fruit stand isn't dumped  over on the sidewalk. I found the twistey plot a little tough to follow in  the first hour, but it all comes together nicely in the end. It's a very  good ending too i might add. Great acting across the board. I thought  Deniro and Reno were very good together. Interesting relationship.

149822,4,079284209X,"Odd film. Twenty years ago it would have been unremarkable, but nowadays it's almost unique - a straight-faced, serious, 'thick-ear' cold-war thriller, played like a cross between John Le Carre and Alistair McClean,  but not quite as good as either. Everything looks grim and gritty, and  despite the post-cold war setting there isn't any post-modern irony here,  it's square jaws all the way.
A top-notch cast make it what it is,  although it's not really a film about people - it's a film about action and  intrigue, but mostly action. Despite the odd way in which the main  characters can commit mayhem in public without anybody seeming to notice,  the gun-fights seem realistic - brutal, confused affairs - and the two car  chases (featuring an array of exotic European saloons, even a Citroen XM),  and in particular the second, are stunning, draining, and exciting.
(Not  many films have Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno pootling about Europe in a  stolen Volkswagen Golf, come to think of it.)
Ultimately though, it goes  on too long. The film doesn't seem to care much for the plot, and in the  end it all seems strangely forgettable - it goes in one ear, and comes out  the other easily enough, but you probably won't remember it much in a month  or so.

No, all are at least capable actors. Bad  directing? No, the scenes were put together well. Perhaps, bad writing?  That's the ticket laddie. The writing was very confusing, the writers used  reference points such as Military base names, other military terms and  jargon that your just supposed to be familar with i suppose. The actors had  some very notable quotes that seem somewhat interesting, but since i don't  understand military terms they're pretty useless. Maybe there was some bad  directing after all, i mean  guns, bullets, rocket launchers, and fast  paced chases over picnic tables and cafes everywhere but not a cop in  sight. I'm no expert but i have watched ""World's most dangerous police  chases"" a few times and cops worldwide are all over you if you look  like your driving funny. So how can they drive on the wrong side of the  highway for about 2 miles, run people off the street, smash into every  obstacle on the road and not 1 cop show up? I suppose the cops knew they  were all ex military secret service type jerks and were just staying out of  the way.

Those sort of digressions make me wonder about the story. I could  neither stay with it, God forbid ahead of it, as we've been conditioned in  most films today of this genre. There have been wonderful, simple heist  films (The Italian Job) and complicated ones (Heat), but Ronin is neither,  just messy.
What might have been a wonderful,  fast-paced car chase is  destroyed by too many close ups of a very scared Robert Deniro in the chase  car. A needless appearance of Katarina Witt verifies that `sold out for no  good reason' feeling.
The characterizations are all too predictable,  Natasha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce are weak in key roles. Stellan  Skarsgard is superb, however. Jean Reno and Michel Lonsdale, as always, are  excellent.

149833,4,079284209X,"From reading the unfavorable reviews, I see that many watchers were nonplussed by things that an audience trained to enjoy action-film conventions would dislike.  First, not having omniscience of the plot and  all its details, to include the unrevealed contents of the case.  Second,  the relative economy of the dialogue, which wanted for pithy one-liners and  irrelevant references to pop culture.  Third, the small and localized  setting of the action, which seemed not to involve the security of the free  world, justice or some greater truth.
John Frankenheimer explains his  intent with great clarity when you turn the ""Commentary"" option  on.  He explains that the audience never learns the contents of the case  because it's really not important from the protagonists' point of view, and  I agree: these men have no desire to know what they will steal so long as  they are paid adequately.  It follows a sound logic.
As far as the  dialogue is concerned, I can enjoy the fact that the characters speak only  when it suits some purpose, and will often leave things unsaid for the  audience to wonder about.  For example, John Frankenheimer speaks briefly  about the man in the wheelchair, whom three characters discuss without this  man ever appearing in the film.  It's unimportant that we learn more about  him than his position as a fixer and procurer of talent for privately  funded, illegal operations requiring the skills of former secret  operatives.
I appreciate the ingenuity of its presentation.  In other  films, the operatives might have a sheet of information passed from  inviolate sources to plan their attack, or they could watch from high-orbit  satellites as they moved in.  The bit with DeNiro improvising a loud  metallic noise to test the reflexes of the opposing security team was  brilliant - the act of a smart and resourceful man with few assets beyond  his own intelligence.  When these characters speak, they imply a depth of  cunning and experience that shades the action in interesting ways.
Maybe  you didn't like it that much on its first viewing, but if you don't mind a  shift in your viewing paradigms, _Ronin_ is really satisfying.  Again, I  recommend the DVD but even renting and watching it twice should prove  entertaining...if you don't demand to be spoonfed by the films that you  watch.",951523200,10,2335,4.992167101827676

Bullitt, whose car  chase has given it iconic status, its place in the annals of history is  assured, and Ronin will be sure to join it there. John Frankenheimer should  seriously consider just directing car sequences for other peoples' movies  (he did all the second unit directing himself). The second chase through  the streets of Paris is unprecedented, and to those who still think The  French Connection or The Seven Ups reign supreme, this should finally  silence their claims.

To me this  movie possesses a severe crisis of purpose. People come, people go; people  get shot, people - erm, get shot anyway. There seems to be a complete lack  of viewer attachment to the film - we tend not to care one way or another  about any of the characters because as soon as we do? Bam, they're gone.

To criticize the performances as too low-key or boring (as  some have written here) is also missing the point. This is the finest  glimpse into the mercenary lifestyle since THE DOGS OF WAR. The way each of  the _real_ mercenaries in the crew (people who have seen the film know what  I'm referring to here) acts is perfect for making the impression just how  dispassionate these men must be. They are professionals hired to do a job.  The lone passionate one among them stands out like a sore thumb. All the  actors shine in this film, but especially DeNiro, Reno and Skaarsgard (who  is ruthless in the extreme). I agree with many here that the chase scenes  are the best ever done (yes, even better than THE FRENCH CONNECTION). And  the gun battle in the streets of that French town is the equal of the one  in HEAT (although a lot shorter). But it is the twist and turns of the  plot, the world-weary cynicism that pervades the characters' lives, and the  stunning photography that elevates this film into the stratosphere. Plus,  the little set pieces, such as Reno and DeNiro's visit to Reno's retired  friend's house, add even more depth than you would expect to an already  well-textured film. RONIN is easily one of the best thrillers of this  decade or even of the last quarter-century. By the way, the DVD has an  optional alternate ending that is even more downbeat than the original!

Despite the fact that it extended Pulp Fiction's original ""let's run around with a case but never show what's in it"" idea, Ronin has original chase scenes and the  look of a genuine high speed flick that's also a good urban  thriller.
Sort of like the Reservoir Dogs, the ronin have to figure out  who the traitor is; plot twists and deceptions abound and keep the audience  guessing who is really on who's side.
Natascha McElhone was excellent as  the IRA terrorist Deirdre, and Jonathan Pryce delivered a nice cameo as  Seamus.  I loved it!",946339200,,591,4.669902912621359

I was so impressed it was one of the first DVDs I purchased.  The sound techs who worked on the nuances of the different weapons used  should be commended. Awesome in its authenticity.  I knew to expect  terrific car sequences from Frankenheimer, seeing as he directed one of the  great racing movies of all time, Grand Prix.  The chase scene through the  crowded streets and tunnels of Paris is worth the price of admission alone.  The movie is driven and authentic to a fault. Ronin rocks.",945388800,9,649,4.582608695652174

I have often wondered if film students  take a class on car chases and are forced to watch The French Connection  over and over again.  Well, Ronin, on top of being a very good, well  produced and acted film, also has the distinction of having one of the best  car chase sequences ever on film.  The enhanced visuals and sound that DVD  offer make it that much more enjoyable.  If you are a big fan of car  chases, buy this DVD.

The car chases are probably the best ever filmed; they surpass those in Bullit by the same director, and they are not even the best part of the  film, just a bonus!  The plot is not ""thready"" by any means, as  it was dubbed by many critics, rather it is intracately designed for the  alert viewer to spot various clues and keep them guessing until the end.  The action is incomparble for this type of film.  Beyond the filmic  elements, this sort of subject matter is appealing to many, as well as the  beautiful locations of France.  Above all this is the smart man's action  film.  I would not be without it in my DVD library.

149893,5,079284209X,"If half-stars were allowed, I'd give this 4.5 stars. Generally it is worthy of 5 stars but there are several points when the story either lags or isn't quite fleshed out.
I can see how the enigmatic aspects of this  film could be irritating to some viewers. I, however, fell in love with the  whole flavor of the film and accepted its flaws as part of the price of  admission. I love how the characters more or less continually evaluate  their partners for dependability, loyalty, capability and motives. And how  the people that are good at that kind of work recognize what is important  in each other.
It's a classic cold war-type thriller (notwithstanding  that it's post cold war). Sort of a noir James Bond film except way less  cartoonish. The heros and villans are much less clearly defined and  loyalities seem to shift quite a lot.
And, of course, there are the car  chases. What sets the chases apart from other great car chase movies is the  authenticity (except for the fact that Natascha McElhone looks like she's  never driven fast in her life...) The cars handle and sound appropriately  and what a lineup of cars we are treated to! Many of Europe's finer large  high-performance sedans including the great nitrous oxide infused Audi S8  and the classic Mercedes 6.9. I haven't checked out the credits closely,  but I'm assuming they hired some rally pros because they were tossing those  tanks around with beauty and skill.
I showed this DVD to my folks because  I knew my dad would appreciate the automobiles. I was pleased that my mom  became totally captivated by the film's intrigue and gave it two thumbs up.",944784000,4,1629,4.712765957446808

The car chases are the best I have  ever seen in that they have people racing at extremely high speeds (they  really are going over 100mph, the film isn't speeded up)in what looks like  a real Paris city street during normal traffic.  The most interesting thing  however is that they use European only models that you don't see in the  U.S. (example, the Audi S8, Citroen XM, Peugeot 406, Renault  Safrane).

But no. Sure, the colors are subdued and they  may talk a lot, but here's where the misunderstanding begins. Just 'cos  they talk more (which in retrospect, I'm not even sure they do all THAT  much), doesn't necessarily mean it's a slow movie. -There's one vital thing  which distinguish the 70's from the 90's: the editing.

149898,3,079284209X,"John Frankenheimer is at his strongest when combining human endeavour with automated weight, as ""The Train"" and ""Grand Prix"" showed.  In Ronin he tries more of the same, but with patchy results.  Nothing wrong with the casting, or the fundamentals of the plot.  A  collection of strong actors strike sparks off each other as they establish  interrelationships prior to a big heist.  Shades of ""Reservior  Dogs"" perhaps, but here although the director adheres strictly to a  real chronology we soon become aware that we are as much in the dark as the  protagonists, and that treachery and double-dealing can only be just around  the corner.  DeNiro seems to be reprising his role in ""Heat"" and  Reno is as reliable as ever as the film gets into gear.  The first set  piece, a bungled exchange of cash for a cache of arms on the rain-slicked  banks of the Seine, sets the tempo and begins to expose the strengths and  weaknesses of the characters.  We are then quickly brought to the main  heist itself, a protracted and violent sequence which includes bravura car  stunts  done without digital effects, front or back projection and with  very little undercranking.  Cinema at its gripping, visceral best.  But as  the plot begins to twist and develop, Ronin seems to lose its edge and  quality.  Some questionable performances from Jonathan Pryce and others,  very uneven pacing and a rash of storyline quirks combine to stall the  movie just when one expected more.  Perhaps as a traditional three-act  structure this would not have happened, but such devices are no longer  fashionable.  Here, the director has mismanaged foreshadowing, undermined  believability and failed to develop the character arcs sufficiently.  A  second car chase is superficially spectacular but overlong and cliched,  borrowing heavily from ""To Live and Die in LA"".  Worse is the  lamentable climax at an ice rink, of all places, and a lame coda for DeNiro  and Reno that really lets down the ending.  The DVD contains an alternative  ending which is slightly better.  Fans of the genre and the director will  admire Ronin, and it is a good film.  What a pity it did not aspire to be a  great one.",939600000,,2175,4.870523415977962

It has powerful action sequences,  car chases, and the classic intrigue of international espionage.  Spy  movies have thrilled audiences since Hitchcock's ""Torn Curtain""  and will continue to fascinate.  The ending was quite believable although  not too desirable to many.

Natascha McElhone is a lovely dazzler combining a sensuous understated beauty with a journeyman actor's presence. With a simple look or a roll of  her eyes she speaks volumes. De Niro has never been tougher or more  compelling as the everyman, Sam. He reminds me of Bogart in his grittier  roles. Jean Reno is quickly becomming one of my favorite actors. He is a  man's man with a sincere delivery and deep sad eyes. He also adds the aura  of the world weary but stoic Frenchman to the mix. I love French and the  bits of French dialogue interspersed in the movie resonate with wryness.  The interplay and rapport between the Jean Reno and Robert DeNiro  characters  plays true and is one of my favorite things about this  relatively realistic action film. Frankenheimer has a superb eye for detail  and the cutters have done a marvelous job. This story will keep you on edge  for most of its running length.

149956,4,079284209X,"A John Frankenheimer's movie is never innocent. You always have to search what's hidden behind the images this director present, to interpret the silences between the words spoken. And RONIN isn't so different from  Frankenheimer's most interesting movies.
Why RONIN ? A few lines, at the  beginning of the film, explains than, in the medieval Japan, a samurai  whose master has disappeared becomes in a certain way mad and, after having  done reprehensible actions, kills himself by committing seppuku  (hara-kiri). This samurai with a troubled mind is called a RONIN.
Now we  have to remember that Frankenheimer, in 1982, presented a great action  movie, THE CHALLENGE, starring Scott Glenn, whose intention was to confront  american and japanese points of view about moral questions. So why not  concentrate ourselves on RONIN by having in mind that the real subject of  the film is NOT the challenge to present the longest car chase ever filmed  but something else. Hidden between gunshots and fast cars.
Just think of  a recurrent theme of RONIN : the suicidal ritual of the samurai, the  Seppuku. Let's observe how one of the gang's hired man died in his car with  an open throat. And Robert De Niro ! He will symbolically try to commit  seppuku during surgery but will faint.
In fact, the only character that  will follow the strict code of honour of the samurais will be Deirdre. For  sure, she knows exactly what she is doing when she abandons Seamus. But,  here again, John Frankenheimer prefer not to be too explicit about the fate  of the young irish woman. The alternate ending of RONIN would maybe give us  the answer.

They are first and foremost a forum in which to  tell a tale. This movie takes men and women who are in a rarified line of  work, and shows us how they are just like us; that is, they are just trying  to earn a living, and make it day to day. That being the case, it makes  sense that they would be cautious about engaging themselves in an operation  before they are sure they are prepared to do so.
