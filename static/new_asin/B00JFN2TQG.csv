6356586,1,B00JFN2TQG,"It is hard to believe WB has released another version of the Rankin/Bass Hobbit with the botched soundtrack. As other reviews have noted, all DVD versions are missing numerous crucial sound effects and music and dialogue is missing or incorrectly mixed. This is one of my favorite childhood films and the only way to see it correctly is on a 1990s era VHS.  This should have been fixed years ago but apparently WB absolutely does not care about this film or it's many fans.",1408579200,129,473,4.630952380952381
6356587,4,B00JFN2TQG,"They are great movies, in an animated sense. They tell the basic story of Tolkien's novels. They are worth watching if you like animated versions of stories. It's interesting to do a comparison of them since they have completely different animation based on the technology of the time that they were made. The only true difference between them is that the animation changed because the directors changed and that totally changed the movies story and animation. The hobbit and The Return of the King movies were fully animated films by American directors for children. The Lord of the Rings animated version had a director born in Europe and blended Fellowship of the Ring with the Two Towers and the animation was based on live actors and wasn't proper for an animated children's tale. It was too 'dark' for children of the 70's and 80's and I'm one of them",1407888000,2,857,4.758389261744966

The infamous soundtrack issues are still not fixed.  This has the same missing sounds as the last DVD version.  Yet again, something that was right on a decades-old VHS release has been wrong on multiple iterations of the DVD.  I'm returning mine.  I suggest you don't even buy yours.",1405987200,110,432,4.631578947368421
6356589,3,B00JFN2TQG,"I am hesitant for only 1 reason. The DvDs in this set have not come out, but there is one point I want to make. 1 point to rule them all;

The Animated Hobbit needs fully restored sound.

In every DvD edition half of the audio is missing. The depths of chorus music sung by a half dozen men sound like drunken duets, the dragon destroys his cave with fire and brute force and it sounds like a bunny rabbit breaking a thin sheet of styrofoam, and the wealth of the soundtrack that defined my childhood sounds like it is coming out of an iPod ear bud left on my kitchen table at a high volume. If they do not go back to AT LEAST the audio quality of the VHS, I willwell, do nothing honestly but stew like a nerd on the internet (as I always do), but I would WANT to shove my hairy feet up someone's incompetent #%& for making this mistake 3 times in the last 15 years.",1404172800,37,866,4.02906976744186
6356590,2,B00JFN2TQG,"Long before Peter Jackson ever turned the world of J.R.R. Tolkien into a string of blockbusters, there were... there was ANOTHER Tolkien trilogy.

Specifically, there was a trio of animated movies based on Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings""... except they weren't by the same people, didn't have the same style, and didn't even cover the whole plot. And while ""The Hobbit"" is a fairly decent adaptation (if sometimes baffling), the two movies that address the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy are a cornucopia of poor animation, bizarre stylistic choices and strange plotting.

The Rankin-Bass ""The Hobbit"" follows mild-mannered Bilbo Baggins, who is invaded by a bunch of strange dwarves and the wizard Gandalf -- and then dragged on an epic quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. But the little gang runs afoul of wargs, goblins, hostile wood-elves and a strange froglike creature called Gollum -- and worst of all, Bilbo ends up facing the dragon Smaug himself.

Ralph Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"" takes place about sixty years later, when Bilbo suddenly vanishes during his birthday party. He's left all his possessions -- including a magical Ring of invisibility -- to his young nephew Frodo. But then Gandalf reveals to Frodo that the Ring is actually the One Ring, which contains the power and evil of the Dark Lord Sauron.... and it's made Frodo a target for the Black Riders.

So Frodo, his cousins Merry and Pippin and his creepy gardener Sam (seriously, what was Bakshi thinking?) join up with an elf, a Viking, an American Indian king-in-waiting, Gandalf and a very tall dwarf. Not kidding But their quest to destroy the Ring is derailed by two fatalities and the Fellowship being split up.

After hearing that Bakshi's version would remain unfinished, Rankin-Bass decided to make ""The Return of the King"" as an unofficial ""sequel."" You might expect it to pick up where that last one left of... but it doesn't. Instead, it jettisons half the cast, moves several plot points forward, and fills up the space with bad folk-songs.

""The Return of the King"" opens with Sam finding the Ring, while he's trying to free the captive Frodo -- but even if he does, the trek across Mordor may be more than the two hobbits can stand. Meanwhile, Gandalf tries to shore up the city of Minas Tirith, with the help of the Rohirrhim... and the timely arrival of Aragorn, who acts like a plank of wood who has never met Gandalf before.

It should be noted that the ""Hobbit"" adaptation is a pretty decent adaptation of Tolkien's story, despite some peculiar plot and artistic choices (for some reason, the Elfking is blue and wrinkly). ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a somewhat faithful adaptation, but is often made unintentionally ridiculous by weird stylistic choices (why is Boromir a Viking? Why is Elrond a Caesar?), Bakshi's trademark rotoscoping, and his depiction of Samwise Gamgee as a hyperactive gay gnome.

And ""Return of the King""... well, there are a few things in the movie that work. A few. The rest of it is almost mesmerizingly awful. The constant singing, the hyper-eloquent Sam (played by Roddy McDowell), the lack of Legolas and Gimli, the wooden human characters, the framing device that kills all tension... simply nothing works.

But the biggest problem with this trilogy is simply that it does not form a cohesive story. ""Hobbit"" can be enjoyed by newcomers, but the same is not true of the next two movies. Anyone who has not read the books or seen the live-action movies will probably have no idea what is going on -- Bakshi's movie makes no sense if you haven't read the books, and the massive gap between it and ""Return of the King"" leaves several things unanswered.

Furthermore, though ""Return of the King"" is a so-called ""sequel"" to wrap up Bakshi's story, there is no attempt to match his style or characterization. Occasionally this is an improvement (nothing could be worse than Bakshi's Sam), but it ends up depositing a truly dreadful Aragorn, Merry, Pippin and the world's whiniest Frodo in our laps.

""Lord of the Rings/Hobbit/Return of the King"" brings together two pretty awful movies and one decent one. Enjoy ""The Hobbit"" for what it is, but the following movies are confusing, disjointed and bafflingly bad.",1403481600,31,4276,4.867950481430537

6356601,5,B00JFN2TQG,"Two score and a couple of years ago, I first watched Rankin-Bass' versions of The Hobbit and The Return of the King as they originally appeared on TV. Betwixt the two, I sat totally alone in a vast movie theater, watching the Bakshi version of The Fellowship of the Ring combined with The Two Towers.

At last I have had the good fortune to see all three movies in sequence, without being interrupted by TV commercials, or by having to sit on a lumpy chair cushion with freezing air conditioning blasting right down my neck.

Just as with Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde or Lerner and Lowe, there can never be a definitive interpretation of Tolkien's stories. It is worth taking the time to read/view/listen to the interpretations of the stories in the different media. And by all means, take the time to read the original books themselves!

As of this date I have only watched ""The Hobbit,"" and I noticed several sound effects and musical effects were missing. Smaug was missing his roar over Laketown, the flapping of the Thrush as it spoke to Bard, all missing. At first I thought it was a setting on our player, but that turned out to not be the case. Seems that we were not the first or seemingly the last to find these issues.
In all, the movie is still enjoyable, but these missing bits strike memories that I have tried to share, but the experience is sadly, lacking.",1500422400,9,739,4.4411764705882355

In this case the Peter Jackson version is far and away superior.  The Return of the King, ugh, they tried to tell too much story in too short a time frame, and shoe horn in musical numbers.  At the end of the day, the only reason to purchase this set is if you have fond memories of these movies, other wise, purchase the animated The Hobbit by itself and get Peter Jackson;s Lord of the Rings",1482796800,3,576,4.218181818181818

6356667,5,B00JFN2TQG,"I enjoyed watching these 3 animated films again.  I had them all in their original VHS form, but had thrown them
out when I updated many of my video library to DVD.  When I discovered that  all 3 were available together,
I couldn't pass them up.",1417219200,,245,4.282608695652174

8650582,5,B00JFN2TQG,"While certain parts of Tolkien's stories have been removed from these cartoon-version renditions, at least no characters have been butchered.  The feel is much the same, and the music is often formed using words from Tolkien's books- e.g., the ""dark"" riddle in Gollum's cave, which is sung in the background, as we watch Bilbo and Gollum interact.  Regardless of what anyone tells me about the apparent ""overly cute"" aspects of the art, I find it quite pleasing and, while not realistic (Given that these are made-up characters, I find that quite appropriate, personally.), exactly, I find that the mix between realism and fantasy represented in the illustrations comes close to Tolkien's intention of hinting at a possibly connection between hobbits and modern men, over time.",1532649600,,777,5.208
