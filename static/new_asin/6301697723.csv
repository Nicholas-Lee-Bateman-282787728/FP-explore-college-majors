It's always a pleausre to watch, and even if it wasn't period, I'd  love this film. It is much better than the teen melodrama ""Creul  Intentions""",967161600,,301,4.537037037037037
368865,5,6301697723,"What big-budget effort from a major director has ever suffered such  damnable obscurity?  ""Valmont"" is one of the most idiosyncratic  and playful films of latter-day cinema, which might help to explain how it  failed to capture Oscar attention on the heels of ""Dangerous  Liaisons"" but hardly accounts for why it has been so unreadily  available since.  Amongst other things, this film gave Annette Bening and  Colin Firth their first major roles, Fairuza Balk her first adult one, and  proved the parting bow from the enchanting Fabia Drake.  This may yet prove  the best performance from Bening, a major performer still in the midst of a  grand career.  Her interpretation of the Marquise de Merteuil combines the  physical  allure of Giselle before the camera with the verbal vivacity of a  Madonna interview.  Meg Tilly captures the allure of every self-doubting  young married woman in her Tourvel, and Fairuza Balk, in counterpoint to  her tough, Gothy teenagers, plays Cecile as a blushing nymph.  And Colin  Firth is delightful as an unself-conscious rake-- Forman's thorough  rerendering of Laclos' material reinvents each major character, and the  cast uniformly does very well in a film that deliberately thwarts dramatic  intensity in favor of creating a mood of both sensual abandon and moral  ambiguity.  The ending in particular forces the viewer to ask a great deal  about the feelings of each of these characters.  And what a visual  masterpiece!  Forman's pictorial sense, abetted by Miroslav Ondricek's  ingenious cinematography, makes ""Valmont"" one of the most  stunning films ever shot-- if Fragonard had been able to make a film, it  really would have looked like this.  Hopefully this tenderhearted, erotic  film will finally receive the audience it demands.",966297600,15,1781,5.239285714285714

369025,3,6301697723,"***SPOILER ALERT****

As a fan of Dangerous Liaisons (the movie), I stayed away from this because I figured it would be a huge let down after that perfection. Upon seeing the rave reviews here, I thought I'd give it a glance. Wow, what a disappointment. There is so much wrong with this.

1) There is nothing ""dangerous"" about it. Merteuil and Valmont appear immature and childish, not scheming, conniving, lovers of manipulation. Valmont's seduction of Tourvel was a huge yawn. Tourvel throwing over her husband and acting like a stalker was unsavory and out of character. It just made for an odd mix. The book is about revenge over perceived slights. This is just a story about juvenile impulses.

2) There is no chemistry or real history between Merteiul and Valmont. Everything relies on the relationship between these two. Take the ""war"" scene. What is that? Why is there even a declaration of war? It makes no sense. Very weak.

3) There is no period in this period film. People are wonderfully dressed. The settings are fantastic, yet all the people have modern sensibilities, language, and mannerisms. Why is Cecil running around the house like a goof when she's spent the last 4 years in a convent learning how to behave? It completely ruins the whole need for a period at all. Why not just set it in the modern day with a culture that does arranged marriages?

4) Colin Firth was all wrong. This is an American film. A good cast has a single flow and feel. Firth did a great job of blending with that American vibe, but he ends up looking like a joker with a big, toothy grin. He's too well known to go there. It's all wrong. Let Firth be the English Firth that he is. He's not seductive. He's not all testosterone sexy. He does what he does well, and this is not it. Valmont is too big a player to get that part wrong.

5) The ending is a big ""so what."" So, after all the shenanigans, THAT is the ending we get? It is nonsensical for Valmont to show up at a duel drunk. He's a worldly, smart guy. Merteuil just gets off scott free. The aunt is GLAD? Cecil is pregnant?! Cecil marries Gercourt. After the faithful and pious Tourvel TELLS her husband about her affair, she goes back to him like nothing ever happened?! WHAT! Snooze fest.

So, why 3 stars and not one? Truth be told, it is only because there is a fabulous movie and incredible book that this pales so much in comparison. It's a long, nonsensical two hours, but the acting is okay, the costumes and sets are very well done, and despite all the things wrong with it, it was still okay.",1424476800,,2558,4.464668094218416

That expectation proved unfortunate, as ""Valmont"" is ultimately a watered down approximation of a plot, with too much reliance on the book to merit an independent appreciation. True, the film was well acted, but I wanted greater substance. If you haven't read ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" I would recommend steering clear of the film.

369072,5,6301697723,"I had already seen ""Dangerous Liaisons"" with Malcovitch and Glen Close (same story exactly) but I loved this much more. I find the protagonists in this one (Annette Benning and Colin Firth) more believable than Glen Close and John Marcovitch (of the Dangerous Liaisons) and more convincing. It may be because I tend to think that more good looking people are more enticing as seducers. I found Benning warmer and friendlier than Glen Close and more believable to entice the young girl and bring her in her confidence. As regards to Colin Firth, well, he is young and handsome and I would succumb to him any time. One has to see him in this movie as well as the Fever Pitch and Pride and Prejudice to see how different these roles are and how versatile this actor is. The costumes are gorgeous and all the supporting actors very good too. I even like the ending in this one much better.",1391040000,,885,4.5375

The famous lady courtesan promises to become his bedmate only if he can do this, and thus she will also have her secret revenge against the girl's mother, who had once taken her true love from her.
Although Valmont seduces the young bride-to-be, he does not plan on losing his heart to her or to another guest, a virtuous married lady also visiting at his aunt's chateau. Well, he succeeds in seducing both women, but when he goes to claim his reward from his famous lady of the night, she is drunk and simply throws herself invitingly onto her bed as if to say sleeping with Valmont is nothing to her...let's get it over.  Valmont now realizes he would rather have the love of the married woman he met who had loved him only once, but she has fled back to her home and husband! Then, he decides the affection of his teenage lover is the best he can hope for, and so he goes to try to kidnap his teenage lover from her parents and secretly marry her, then at least he can have her love.  However, he finds his escape with her blocked by the girl's maman and servants. The young girl is then hurriedly married off to the General of France. Now, realizing he had won the ""bet"", but lost the love of two better women who could have made him happy, Valmont goes on a nightly drinking binge and finds himself facing a morning duel with a very young music teacher who had also loved the young teenage girl whom they have both lost in marriage to the General.

Liaisons specializes in over-the-top Frenchy behavior, having its own charm and sarcasm.  Valmont expresses the relationships differently with a surprise ending (I don't want to give its different plot away): with less nudity, but more refinement and innocence.  Really can't say which is better.  Both are worth 10 stars.

Both are sublime setpieces about the hypocrisy in society; and in Valmont, self-betrayal is more evident and poignant, maybe.  Worth rewatching on every level.",1326844800,,701,5.425925925925926

Colin Firth is too likable and sympathetic in nature to be cast as Valmont, and this movie will show you that Miss Bening's talents reside in her looks. With the exception of Fairuza Balk, the casting and acting in this version of Dangerous Liaisons smacks of High School Drama Class. A great storyline, beautiful sets, and good costumes will fool some people into thinking this is worth two hours of their time.",1315526400,2,502,4.781609195402299
369229,4,6301697723,"I've seen both Valmont and Dangerous Liaisons and read the book as well. I Know a lot of people will disagree with the title of my review because in comparison to Valmont not only does Dangerous Liaisons has bigger names and obviously budget but it was more successful and earned award nominations including Oscars.

While, there is no denying that Dangerous Liaisons was a perfect movie adoption for the novel and is clearly the *more* faithful to the original story despite it's actors being mis/cast in some roles (ex. Malkovich (not charming enough), Glenn Close (too old), Uma Thurman (too Mature) etc...) I found myself enjoying Valmont as much as Dangerous Liaisons if not more.

The two movies are as two sides of the coin to one story. If DL represented the dark side then Valmont represents the brighter side. The characters here are more cheerful, lively and appear to be *more* socially active. The viewer is also given to see a glimpse of their appearances on several occasions (ex, parties, small gatherings).

Valmont's Colin Firth while doesn't appear as *devilish* or as *heartless* as Malkovich's is more believable as a woman seducer in terms of appearances and charisma. As we see him courting Madame de Tourvel by love sonnets, horse rides and picnics in rural France unlike DL where Valmont looked more uptight and his interactions with Madam de Tourvel were limited to walks in the park and conversations. It helps shows the characters *romantic* side which I think what draws women into Valmont in the first place.

Annette Bening as the wicked Madame de Merteuil doesn't exactly fit in imagination but neither does Glenn Close. Although both actors played the role remarkably with what they were offered I imagine Madame de Merteuil to be played by someone more beautiful and seductive I think someone like Catherine Zeta Jones would've been a good choice in this case but that's just my Opinion.

Meg Tilly as Madame de Tourvel was good but I find myself drawn into Michelle Pfeiffer's performance more perhaps because in this movie we never see the interaction between Valmont and Madame de Tourvel as often. A relationship that I hoped this movie tackled more.

Fairuza Balk plays a very convincing Cecil in terms of acting and appearance as well and thus more believable in the role.

There's a twist in the end that doesn't hold true to the novel but I believe the director wanted to keep the lighter mood going or perhaps making it a bit different for those who've seen DL.

I recommend you rent both movies and maybe borrow the book if you can and see your own preferences and comparisons.",1315180800,2,2621,4.834821428571429

369314,4,6301697723,"This movie was made around the same time as the more famous Dangerous Liaisons, but is a much more enjoyable film. The cast is much better. Cecile and Danceny are appropriate in age and naivety, and Colin Firth and Annette Bening are MUCH more believable as seducer and seductress than are John Malkovich and Glenn Close.  While the latter actors do possess a certain Machiavellian quality, I find them more creepy than attractive in these roles, therefore, hard to accept as successful in the arts of seduction. Meg Tilly's Presidente de Tourvel, while perhaps less overtly appealing than Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays the role in Dangerous Liaisons, is more believable in the role because of her comparative lack of sophistication and worldliness.

Valmont also has a much lighter tone than Dangerous Liaisons, which may belie the title, but in my opinion, is truer to the epistolary novel on which both films are based. My only complaint is with the script of Valmont, which changes some vital aspects of the story and robs the viewer of a bit of satisfaction with the ending. The film has Valmont immediately rejecting Presidente de Tourvel after seducing her, seemingly more eager to claim his reward from Madam de Merteuil, who rejects his claim for no apparent reason. In the novel, Valmont continues to see Presidente de Tourvel and seems to be sincerely falling in love with her. This evokes Madame de Merteuil's jealousy, which is why she rejects Valmont and forces him to abandon Presidente de Tourvel. The film also robs us of Valmont's delicious postmortem revenge on Madame de Merteuil. In the film, she is certainly sad, but her duplicity remains a secret and her face remains unravaged. The book gives us a much more satisfying ending in that respect. It also changes what happens to Presidente de Tourvel. While these changes may be in keeping with the films overall light tone, it is much less satisfying than the more vengeful version.

This is like an indy version as opposed to the lavishly grand hollywood production that came out at the same time:  rather than offer simple moralistic outcomes, its end is far more ambiguous and the characters are deeper, without simple labels that can be attached to them in the facile hollywood manner.

Firth is quite brilliant as Valmont.  At once attractive and vulnerable, this great egoist is reaching a point of boredom in his conquests, actually beginning to question himself yet knowing he probably can't change much to better himself as a human being.  He knows despair and has some notion of what he is missing and what he is destroying.  This is displayed in his relationship with the Bening character, who is a female version of himself.  In a way, they are well matched, but impossible to love and disastrous as partners, sowing destruction out of pique and boredom.  It is awful to witness.

The adjunct characters, such as the ingenue and her callow boyfriend, are also string.  What happens to them is not spelled out, though they move on through life as implied in the film.

369320,1,6301697723,"Les Liasons Dangereuses was the finest epistolary novel of its time, a cold and accurate portrayal of egoism at its worst.  The two principle protagonists play a game of erotic chess with each other, using themselves and others as pieces, with terribly destructive results for all concerned. The psychological insights, and the sheer plot cleverness, of the novel makes it worth reading and re-reading today.

This movie, however, is what Laclos, the author, might have written if he'd been retarded and had absolutely no talent or perception whatsoever.  The names are the same, the rest is profoundly different. I have no idea why the script writer thought it would be a good idea to alter Laclos' masterpiece so that it becomes a brain-dead childish thing, but alas that is precisely what happened.  Add to this mis-casting of the worst kind: poor Colin Firth, who is earnest as the day is long, is cast as Valmont, the man who uses his charm to seduce while remaining utterly untouched within. Perhaps Hugh Grant could have played Valmont with some conviction; Firth alas seems like everyone's favorite son going through the motions but utterly unable to convince us that he's a heartless rake.

Usually there's something to be salvaged from a movie, no matter how bad - moments of unintentional humor, camera angles, something.

Now this movie treats the same somewhat sordid story of the bored French aristocracy in a completely different way. Colin Firth is completely believable and utterly charming as Valmont. Even so a schemer and seducer the director also shows the the softer, more vulnerable side of the main character - which gives him humanity, so lacking in the first movie with John M.

Before he can do it, however, Valmont falls in love with a proper, married woman, Madame de Tourvel.  Learning of this, Merteuil bets Valmont that he can't bed Tourvel, and he happily takes up the challenge.

The plot was so complex that I needed a scorecard to keep straight who was doing what to whom and why.  All the action swirls around Benning's Merteuil and she's malicious and flirty enough, but her American accent detracts from her character.  In fact, the array of American and British accents and their 21st century delivery spoil the illusion that the story is set in 18th century France.  As Valmont, Colin Firth is definite eye-candy but not nearly lecherous enough; he's boyish and pitiable instead of cunning and ruthless.  Meg Tilley (Tourvel) and Henry Thomas, (the music teacher) are incredibly bland and look out of place in a period piece.

The mood of this film is more feel-good, it contains more playful humour and the imagery (especially in the outdoors) is amazing. With `Dangerous Liasons'; the characters (played by Glenn Close and John Malkovich) were more sinister and less likeable (I guess it depends what mood you're in).

369517,3,6301697723,"Chadores Laclo's ""Les Liaisons Dangerous"" was given another go around in 1989's ""Valmont."" Director Stephen Frears had finished his definitive version ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" about six months before. ""Valmont"" is a sumptuous film. Director Milos Forman (""Amadeus"") has an eye for detail and mis en scene. As in ""Amadeus,"" Forman  likes his actors playful. The sets, costumes, lighting and architecture are wonderfully eye filling. To know that countless  doves were dyed blue to be let loose an the opening scene alerts you to the degree of detail Forman adheres to. Annette Bening and Colin Firth as Merteuil and Valmont seem to be enjoying their parts. The acting by Meg Tilly, Fairuza Balk,Sian Phillips and Fabia Drake are also florid and engaging.

However, even without comparisons to Frears earlier film, ""Valmont"" is not a great film. Forman's version of Laclo's tale is mostly entertaining, although at 137 minutes the plot mechanisms get a little turgid after a while. The story is already known from previous adaptions and the reputation of the great novel. The romantized contrivances Forman builds into his version become cumberson because of Forman's desire to soften the edge off the main character's malice. However, to soften ""Les Liaisons Dangerous"" is to blunt it. This approach is like making a vampire film with the fangs pulled out, so no blood gets spilt. Roughly, what's the point? To make a sweet romance? Valmont's shenanigans will not make a hero no matter how much he apparently ""repents"" in the end.

Frears and actor John Malkovich understood that in ""Dangeorus Liaisons."" The tragedy of Valmont's characer is that he is irredeemable, which is why he allows himself to be killed. He hopes his death will bring a recovery to the woman he as wronged, but in the original version she dies anyway. His nihilistic poison is too strong to be sucked out of his victim. Valmont's final sacrifice only destroys his partner in crime (the Marquise de Merteuil), which IS a good thing, but still doesn't make him romantic. Colin Firth certainly looks the part of a charming seducer, more than the homely Malkovich. However, Malkovich has an inner fire and truly slimy charm that Firth's British reserve just can't match. Even when Firth's Valmont is seducing Fairuza Balk's Cecil, the scene is played for sexual comedy, rather than the the truly debauched, immoral rape it clearly is.

Ms. Bening is a fine actress,and has given some very good performances (""The Grifters,"" ""American Beauty""). However her interpretation of Glenn Close's signiture role is too glib to be of lasting interest. In ""Valmont"" Merteuil seems more a pouting debutante, rather than a grown woman with the talent to manipulate all those around her. She always seems to be on the verge of bursting out laughing, to let everyone know how ""evil"" she really is. The term ""camp before it's turned"" applies.

All in all, Forman's take on Laclo's tale is worth a look. Some have even preferred his version over Frears, but I like a cobra to have it's fangs intact, the way nature intended.",1211068800,7,3073,5.003913894324853

That said, I am forced to compare VALMONT with the other versions of this famous French drama. Well...it pales....big time. Even the fact that the film is called VALMONT in the first place is the biggest problem here. Is this story really about The Marquis de Valmont portrayed here by Colin Firth? I would say a resounding ""No!"".This screenplay,freely adapted by the famed Jean-Claude Carriere (UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING,SOMMERSBY,THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE) does not capture the stinging venomous fatality of Christopher Hampton's adapted screenplay that won an Academy Award as ""Dangerous Liaisons""( later captured as CRUEL INTENTIONS) nor does it focus squarely on Valmont. In fact, Valmont is quite missing from the first half of the film! This screenplay seems more intent on dwelling heavily on the character of the young Cecile de Volanges.

There is little continuous soundtrack in Milos Forman's VALMONT.There is much ""dead time"" with only occasional musical interlude that offers little in propelling any of the plot.

The entire film seems to be so tame and safe and lacking in the tension and ""danger"" that is in the book or the Stephen Frears directed version.

All in all, VALMONT fails in having to have been released slightly later than the group that set this story zinging with snakiness and zest with Glenn Close and John Malkovich scheming and conniving with the biting dialogue of Christopher Hampton.

369524,2,6301697723,"If you were to read a summary of this movie, such as the ones in the critics' reviews above, you would get the impression that the main storyline involves the Vicomte de Valmont's seduction of the virtuous Madame de Tourvel and later change of heart due to his love for her.  But you would be wrong.

I had been interested when I found a film adaptation of _Les Liaisons Dangereuses_ titled ""Valmont,"" because I think the Vicomte de Valmont is in some ways the central character of the novel. However, it turns out that he had remarkably little screen-time for the title character.  There are long digressions about Madame de Merteuil and her schemes for Cecile and Danceny between every time we see him, and that plotline, which was secondary in the book and other movie versions I've seen (""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""Cruel Intentions""), seems to dominate this movie.  And while I certainly don't object to the lack of focus on the Valmont/Tourvel romance, which is usually beefed up for modern viewers, I felt like we never really got to know Valmont, the supposed main character.  I often had trouble figuring out what was going on in his head: for example, why does he suggest that Cecile marry Danceny?  Is he doing this out of the goodness of his heart (hopefully not), or to thwart Merteuil (for which he has no motivation at that point in the film), or for some other reason that I can't guess?

I do think Colin Firth did well with what he had, and he certainly portrayed the charming aspect of Valmont's character better than Malkovich in ""Dangerous Liaisons.""  You could actually see why Madame de Tourvel and others would be attracted to him.  But Valmont simply isn't given enough time for us to appreciate or even understand him.

In general I think the rest of the acting is likewise well done - except for the next most important character, the Marquise de Merteuil.  Annette Bening makes her seem like a charming young woman more than a cold-hearted, manipulative one.  In a sense this is a good thing, because we understand why Madame de Volanges would trust her, but we don't really get to see her inner, calculating nature.  Again, I sometimes had a hard time figuring out her actual feelings and intentions at a given point, and this made her less human and sympathetic for me (I never had any of these problems with Glenn Close in ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" whose stunning performance despite everything caused Merteuil to become my favorite character in the movie).  I have to say also that Bening's arch smiles and laughter became annoying after a while (and she was *always* smiling and laughing).

She was really the only actor who disappointed me (though that's no small failing)....  Fairuza Balk is excellent as Cecile.  She really gives off the appropriate air of youth and naivete (much more so than her counterpart in ""Dangerous Liaisons""), and her performance is in my opinion the best in the film, a good thing given the increased importance of her character's plotline.  Sian Phillips does very well as the stern Madame de Volanges, especially compared to Swoosie Kurtz in ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" who seems to portray the character in a comic light.  I also thought Meg Tilly does a good job as Madame de Tourvel, though as I've said her character isn't actually very important in this adaptation.  Unlike Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" she convinced me of Tourvel's virtue and principles right from the beginning, and even made her growing love for Valmont almost believable, not to mention her later obsession with Valmont's happiness, which is just as over-the-top and strange as it is in the book.

Also on the positive side, I really like the music, sets and costumes; much better than those of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" in my opinion.  I like the fact that there were more outdoor scenes, and more color and vibrancy overall.  Furthermore, I thought this movie has a more authentic eighteenth century ""feel"" to it, whereas ""Dangerous Liaisons"" felt more like twentieth century people with twentieth century attitudes and mannerisms put in eighteenth century costumes and settings.  Well, it feels authentic until all the weird stuff starts happening near the end....

Which brings me to my other major objection: while this movie starts out well, as it progresses, some rather bizarre and incredible things start happening (spoilers ahead).  For example, at one point Danceny threatens Madame de Merteuil with a sword - but in that period a gentleman would never do such a thing, especially not Danceny, who always struck me as unusually chivalrous.  Further on, Valmont plans for Cecile to escape from her house disguised as a man - a little too melodramatic and unrealistic for my taste, something you would expect to see in an adaptation of a drama/adventure story like _The Scarlet Pimpernel_, rather than of a social novel like _Les Liaisons Dangereuses_.  For my last example: Valmont hires drunks from a tavern to be his seconds in a duel - not only is this not something an 18th century nobleman like Valmont would have done, but the focus on comedy, provided by a drunk Valmont and his lowlife seconds, made it difficult for me to take seriously the (supposedly) tragic scene of Valmont's death.

Please note that I do not object to these on account of their being digressions from the book - well, I do, but I could have overlooked that if they actually made sense, but as it is they cause the movie to lose credibility for me.  The ending also diverged from that of the book, which would not necessarily be a problem except that I honestly can't tell what the makers of the movie were trying to do by changing the ultimate fates of Cecile, Merteuil and Tourvel in such drastic ways.

So, to sum up: good score, good sets, good costumes, generally good acting - it should have made for a good movie, but the strange choices with regard to the story spoiled it for me.  ""For me"" being the operative words here, however - I realize that I have been reviewing it mostly based on comparison with the book and other movie adaptations.  Maybe I disliked/didn't understand certain elements of plot and character simply because I was looking for this movie to be like _Les Liaisons Dangereuses_ and it wasn't.  So if you're just looking for a entertaining movie to pass the time, and you're not too picky (or you haven't read the book or seen any other film adaptations), you might like it.",1187568000,5,6432,4.801450589301904

Michelle Pfeiffer was disappointing and I felt that Glenn Close's character was pathetic.

369580,3,6301697723,"Based on the novel 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' this is a story of scandal, depravity, deceit, decadence and love set in heyday of pre-revolution French aristocratic society.

For me, this movie has two great strengths. The sets and liberal use of extras really brings 18th century Paris to life. This is a world that lives and breathes and turns independently of the characters and story that is portrayed. This is a refreshing change from many 'period dramas' that feel more like stage productions.

The second strength of this movie is the charming performance of Fairuza Balk as Cecile de Volanges, a 15 year old girl whom has spent most of her life in a convant before being unceremoniously thrust into trecherous web of lovers, arranged marriages and scandals of the outside world. Ironically her rambunctious character is the only person in this entire movie that really seems comfortable and natural; everyone else felt like a stiff cardboard cutout in comparison.

I didn't like the script. The dialogs felt clumsy. For instance if you compare the scene between the Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteuil where they declare war to the same scene in Stephen Frears' adaptation of the same novel 'Dangerous Liaisons (1988)' this version just seems awkward, with no real chemistry or sparks between these two critical characters. I believe the story and intention of the original author is almost completely centric to these two characters and their relationship with each other and this film seems to miss it entirely. I know that Colin Firth can do a lot better so I place the blame on the director and the script.

The original novel (and the Frears' adaptation) were oozing with sharp wit and power play. Colin Firth's character could better be described as a 'lovable rogue' in this version which is fine, but I think a serious diversion from the source material and just didn't do it for me.

Firth's so called predatory depravity is somewhat undermined by his constant childishness. If he had really set his sights on Cecile and this was simply an act to get her guard down, then it would be understandable, but the Marquise practically has to push him into her room and lock the door to actually get him to perform the deed. In short, Colin Firth was too nice, he had the charm but he didn't have the beast within.

His seduction of Madame de Torveil most likely could have been more expertly executed by a horny teenager just coming out of puberty, and the fact she falls in love with him heart and soul leads you to believe that really despite her protestations her attentions are somewhat easily 'diverted' which is a terrible undermining of the true purpose of her character. On the plus side she does a very good performance of a woman who has completely surrendered her body and soul to this man, sadly the rest of her performance I found lacklustre.

Overall when the credits were rolling I felt empty. I wasn't sure where the director was really going with this film, and that doubt hadn't cleared up any by the end. For some reason Balk's performance haunts me, and stays in my mind as the only thing that stands out in this film. I wish she had been in Frears' adaptation instead of Uma Therman. The fact she was nearly able to steal this film is really a criticism of everything else in it.

If you have heard about or read the book and want a powerful screenplay with betrayal, sex and scandal then I strongly recommend watching Stephen Frears 'Dangerous Liaisons' instead of this film.

If you want a light Sunday afternoon period drama that will charm you and seduce you to an era past, or if you happen to have a crush on Colin Firth then this film is certainly recommendable.",1156377600,6,3712,4.716049382716049

This movie was unfortunate to come out nearly at the same time as the more popular ""Dangerous Liasons"" featuring more stars... I've seen the movie many times on television, and I admit it is a good entertainment, but it never really made me crazy. And, personally, STARS DOESN'T MEAN GREAT ACTORS, in most cases...

Not long ago VALMONT was shown on television, and having both read the book and seen two movie versions of it (""Dangerous Liaisons"" and an old french version with Jeanne Moreau) I was very curious to see what this one would have to offer...

For me, I've never seen a better Valmont or a better Marquise... And the whole cast is great. That's what I call good acting and directing... I haven't seen all Colin Firth's movies, but I can definetely say that it must be one of his best performances ever... Watching him act as Valmont is simple delicious !  Comparing is not always a good thing, but this movie is more luxurious and more ""serious"" than ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and the great acting adds to a great result ; a much classier version. If one is seduced by some aging and not-so-attractive Malkovich & Close, well, each his own taste... And I don't consider Pfeiffer and Thurman as great actresses.

 I'm sure I won't be able to convince everyone that VALMONT has much more subtle and full-of-finesse performances, and even though it is not a perfect copy of the book, it is the closest in spirit and meaning. Worth your time !",1154822400,14,1582,4.676258992805756
369582,5,6301697723,"This adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's  Les Liaisons Dangereuses , written just a few years before both the American and French revolutions is deeply interesting but also disappointing. Interesting because of the precise description it provides us with of this aristocratic absolute monarchy, a picture so true that we seem to be there and witness the last moments of a completely rotten society. The rot is shown in the evolution of aristocratic women in this society. They have nothing to do. So they plot and conspire to capture the sexual favors of the available males in their salons, and strangely enough they are not very numerous. Here the action is centered on one of these, an aristocratic gigolo of sorts. Valmont who has signed an alliance with a widow, de Merteuil, to conquer and enjoy any person of their respective opposite sexes no matter what the consequences may be. Along this line a young girl of fifteen, who is to be married with an older man, and who is just out of a convent, innocent and naive, at least, will be sexually and sentimentally educated : she will fall in love with her harp teacher, a knight of some seventeen years of age, and then she will be raped by Valmont himself while writing under his dictation a letter to that young friend of a harp teacher of hers, and then finally marry the older man when she will have understood that it is best to be married with an older man because you can manage to have as many lovers as you want under his very nose, especially since she is pregnant of this obnoxious Valmont. What can come out of this parasitic social class ? Nothing but a revolution. But Milos Forman decides not to point in that direction, and even to be very careful not to let one single hint go through. That is the great shortcoming of the film that becomes innocuous since it neglects what made the success of the novel at the time (1782) : the terrible message of an apocalyptic end coming up soon. When no moral code is respected any more the end is close, when Babylon triumphs the Second Coming is around the corner. Yet a very interesting exploration of this decadent nobility that is only noble in their titles and privileges.

369583,1,6301697723,"I still search in vain for the version of Les Liaisons Dangereuses that I found at two o'clock in the morning on HBO. This is not it.

Colin Firth and Annette Bening are both very competent, experienced actors, so I must conclude that it's the script that's abysmal. It lacks all the passion and cruelty that this story is theoretically about. Cruel Intentions was a a better retelling.

Meg Tilly, as Madame de Tourvel, can't get comfortable with her lines, never mind trying to hide her very American accent, and is implausible as a love interest because of a stiffness that rivals Keanu Reeves'. Fairuza Balk is just TOO young in appearance; her performance goes beyond naivete into jailbait, and the yuck factor of 30-something Firth and 14 or 15 (in appearance, anyway) year-old Balk destroys any enjoyment of any scene involving the pair of them.

To be succinct, Dangerous Liaisons is predicated on cruelty, passion, and tragedy. This movie fails on all three counts. Neither Firth nor Bening comes off as cunning or manipulative; rather, clumsy and stupid. There is no spark between them. I bought this DVD based on Amazon recommendations and I have to say, Glenn Close and John Malkovich (shocking, considering it's Malkovich) absolutely set the screen on fire in their version of Dangerous Liaisons. Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman were perfect, and Keanu Reeves' appearance was mercifully brief.

If you're looking for Dangerous Liaisons, Valmont is not worth your money or your time. Your money would be better spent on a different version.",1147219200,7,1554,5.011627906976744

Now I'm not talking about [just] period accuracy; I'm talking about understanding the attitudes and ideas behind a work written long ago. If you don't understand these, you end up with ""Dynasty"" in corsets and wigs.

This is a movie that is both sensual and humorous, romantic and tragic, but never loses its lust for color beyond the screen.

Annette Bening's (V) Merteuil is less evil than Glenn Close's (DL).

I prefer Malkovich's Valmont for his impishness and tragic depth.  I prefer Meg Tilly's (V) Tourvel to Michelle Pfeiffer's because I have never seen such a convincing performance of a woman in love.  I've seen such a face a few times in my life, but it was real, not an act.  Her face is illuminated, transfigured.

It is the story of the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, two rivals who use sex as a weapon to humiliate and degrade others, all the while enjoying their cruel games. None of these characters ever  historically existed, but the author certainly found his inspiration from real people, and by observing the decadence of the French aristocracy shortly before the French Revolution.

Milos Forman, the famous and talented director born in Czechoslovakia, made a great movie here, although maybe not as successful as ""Amadeus"" - perhaps because it was made shortly after the adaptation of the same book by Stephen Frears? At least, it is not the typical American scenario: ""good against evil"" and ""the good wins at the end"". Here, the main characters have nuances and contradictory thoughts. Annette Benning gives a superb and inspired performance as the smart, insensitive, manipulative Marquise de Merteuil. The British actor Colin Firth is the most charming Valmont I have ever seen! A bizarre  but yet very likeable ""Libertin"" of the 18th century.

369637,5,6301697723,"A wonderful film for the boudoir, dealing with a treachorous widow {Merteuil: Annette Bening}  and her lover Valmont {Colin Firth} who make a bet that a certain perfidious woman can be seduced, despite all indications to the contrary. Indeed, where there's a will, there certainly is way. The aristocratic world of the flesh runs rampant in 17th century France, with passionate lusts, delicious seductions, precarious predicaments, beautiful environments, fiendish gentlemen and lascivious ladies - veritable succubi and incubi enjoying the pleasures of the earth, eachother, and loving every minute of it.

It seems this is the only manner where the so-called ""golden rule"" can be applied in ""love thy neighbor as thyself"", where 'love' is merely a euphemism for lust.

The sets are absolutely splendid, a definite inspiration for one's own total environment, and the actors, particularly the sublime Meg Tilly {Tourvel} for My taste, are superb. Etiquette abounds even through sinister means. The rest of the plot deals with a series of exquisite enticements. Pre-'The Craft' Fairuza Balk plays nubile 'Cecile', seduced by the salacious Valmont during a tutoring session, and even her boyfriend Danceny {Henry Thomas from E.T.} is himself seduced by the voracious Merteuil as part of a subsequent quarrel between the two, who mirror eachother in many respects, and actually admire one another's ardent natures.

Sadly, due to one bad decision, Valmont falters in a duel, and meets his demise at the hands of Danceny. It was rather humorous viewing the funeral where many of the women attending placed flowers and adoration upon him in the coffin, where the viewer knows he took his liberties with each one.

Personally, I enjoyed this version of the novel much better than the over-hyped ""Dangerous Liaisons"", which itself does have its points, although Valmont seems somewhat more 'authentic'.",1129420800,10,1896,5.327759197324415

369640,4,6301697723,"The two movies, `Dangerous Liaisons' directed by Stephen Frears and `Valmont', directed by Milos Forman are a real anomoly in that they were released at almost exactly the same time and tell almost exactly the same story, based on an old novel, `Les Liaisons Dangeruese' by Choderlos de Laclos. It is a minor tragedy that `Valmont' received so much less attention and promotion than `Dangerous Laisons'. I suspect that had a lot to do with the fact that `Valmont' was released by the company Orion which may have been in its last throes of survival and simply did not have the means to promote the film.

The only bright side of this situation is that the `Dangerous Liaisons' implementation of this story is much better. It is a sign of the value of `...Liaisons' that it is much better than a really worthy movie.

I believe the difference in the quality of the two movies lies directly on the aptness of the casting and the quality of the acting. On all the lesser qualities which go into making a movie such as set decoration, cinematography, editing, music and the like, the two films are easily on equal terms.

The heart of the matter is in the comparison of `...Liaisons' casting of Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the principle roles versus `Valmont's casting Colin Firth and Annette Bening. While Firth is physically much more believable as a Casanova type, Close and Malkovich are far superior than Bening and Firth at playing world class scoundrels. At the secondary level, `...Liaisons' casting of Uma Thurmen and Keanu Reeves as the two young innocent lovers is immensely more satisfying than the `Valmont casting of unknowns Fairuza Balk and Henry Jones. My memory of their relative careers is a bit dim, but this movie is ample evidence of why Uma and Keanu are big stars today and Fairuza and Henry are footnotes to cinema history.

Of the fifth major role, we have `...Liaisons' casting Michelle Pfeiffer versus `Valmont's casting Meg Tilly. This may be the only role where the two movies are close. Tilly gives a great performance as a nave young wife who ultimately gives into Valmont's seductions, but I think Pfeiffer is even better. Here, the difference may have been in the writing, as I suspect Pfeiffer's role is just a bit more strongly written, so Michele had more to work with.

If nothing else convinces you, compare the seduction scenes between Malkovich and Thurmen versus Firth and Balk and the mix of sweetness with darkness in the former versus the pure soft core porn of the latter will carry the day.",1123632000,3,2539,4.761363636363637

Colin is brooding, John is SCARY. Not the person I'd trust my heart or body to. Glenn Glose is a lot more scary - Anette Benning is fantastic because she is bad, she is sexy,and can be even good sometimes. Glose is bad, bad, and scary. Not to mention that ravishing - and too old - Uma Thurman can't possibly persuade anyone for being innocent, pure and well, virgin. Fairuza Balk, is yet a child. Milos Forman gives the characters a depth that we don't see in DL1. The only thing I consider a good choice, was Michelle Pfeifer as the tragig widow. She is brilliant, beautiful (Meg Tilly was pretty but not as ravishing), and most of all, CAN ACT. A few years younger and next to Firth, could produce sparks. I definitely go for the Milos Forman edition. Despite the really bad ending, he gives his characters more dimensions.

His character portrayal as a charming, playful and likable ""rake"" was far more believable as opposed to John Malkovich's character who came across as mechanical and unfeeling.  More detail is given allowing the viewer to understand why the characters act as they do towards another in ""Valmont"" whereas while watching ""Dangerous Liaisons"", I felt like I was being rushed towards the ending.  If someone is unfamiliar with the storyline, it would only be halfway through the film that they would be able to comprehend what the plot was.  I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in purchasing the dvd rent both versions and make the decision for yourself.  I did and after receiving my copy of ""Valmont"" in the mail today - I'm selling ""Dangerous Liaisons"" on Amazon.com.....anyone interested?  :P",1066867200,22,1513,5.176954732510288
369697,5,6301697723,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Colin Firth is brilliant as Valmont, and I believe his performance was very underated by the American audience--who much prefer X-Men or some such.  Some compare this film to the American film Dangerous Liasisons, which as usual American films are not delicate but must hit one over the head with their point.  And Malcavich (sp)in the lead as the suave, handsome, captivating Valmont is miscasting beyond belief.  I first saw Valmont when it was released in 1989, it only gets better as it ages.  Milos Forman is a genius.",1065225600,13,565,4.724489795918367
369698,3,6301697723,"Valmont came out after the superior Dangerous Liasons and it suffers badly by comparison. Colin Firth is cute but he comes off like a drunken frat boy instead of the cold hearted monster that John Malkovich played. When Malkovich's Valmont dies you know why and it's actually a tragedy. With Firth's Valmont dies it seems pointless.
 Annette Benning is okay at the Countess but while watching her I kept thinking of Glenn Close. Her version of the Countess would've eaten Annette alive. Meg Tilly is terrible. The actors playing young Cecile and Daunceny are well cast, I must say. This wasn't a bad film, it's just weak in several areas.",1058486400,2,638,4.8
369699,5,6301697723,"In the minority I preferred Valmont to the over produced DL on a number of levels. Annette Benning is an engaging if somewhat deranged scorpion poised on the point of a very Dangereuse needle while Glenn Close is cold, icy and somewhat removed from the whole situation. In the Malkevitch vs. Firth debate the former is unattractive and slimey while Firth is a man obcessed with his own sexuality and conflicted about love at the same time.
Handsome and carefully crafted his Valmont is multi dimensional and alluring. He says more with his dark eyes and body language than JM has ever done.
The rest of the cast is equally superior Faruza Balk vs Uma Thurman FB wins, Sian Phillips vs Swoozey Kurtz-take a guess.
Meg Tilly is convincingly conflicted while Michelle Pfeiffer (one of my favs) is out of charecter and out of period just as she is in other period films.
The scope of DL vs Valmont may be superior and the costumes a bit more striking but overall I prefer Valmont. An interesting excercise if to watch both back to back and decide for yourself.",1055721600,7,1056,4.622340425531915

I saw Dangerous Liasons once, and while I enjoyed it, I've never had a desire to see it again.  I've seen Valmont twice, and have decided to purchase it so that I can view it whenever I want.  Where Dangerous Liasons is dark, mean spirited, and somewhat over the top for my taste, Valmont is witty, sexy, and charming.  There is bad behavior aplenty in Valmont, but the characters are human and appealing. They are wicked without being completely evil. As for Colin Firth, this may have been the first role I ever saw him play, but I'm honestly not sure.  Since first seeing Valmont, I've watched Firth in several movies, but never recognized him as the same actor who played Valmont until recently.  He is such a rascal as Valmont, compared to the stiff and somewhat repressed character he usually plays.  I enjoyed all of the performances, including Benning's.  Some of my most favorite movies include Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, and Bridget Jones' Diary.  If you like those, you will probably like Valmont as well.",1054857600,10,1143,4.732323232323233
369741,4,6301697723,"I have watched both Valmont and Dangerous Liaisons DVDs and I definitely prefer Valmont. Its true that the script for Dangerous Liaisons is more complete but Valmont gives more depth to each character. In fact, every time when I watch Valmont, I like it better.
Colin Firth as Valmont is charming and youll truly believe why women fall for him even they knew hes evil. This movie is not his best performance, but hes done it beautifully and very easily, he became the centre of the movie for every frame hes in.  I think Annette Benings not good enough to play Merteuil as she laughed so much that its a bit annoying. Still, shes delighted to look at in the movie with the wonderful costume. Cecil played by Fairuza Balk is best cast in addition to Colin Firth. Shes sweet, young, and energetic and is able to convey her emotions simply with her eyes. I just love to see her. For Meg Tilly, shes sweet too but her performance becomes not profession enough when the above three actors are present.
Back to the story, I have two comments to make. Firstly, its really wrong to have two focuses in the same movie V one is on the evil game between Valmont & Merteuil while another one is the grow-up of Cecil. This focus has to be the game between Valmont & Merteuil. But there is not even a line to explain the relationship between them which makes audience quite confused at the beginning if the audience didn't read the book. So, when Merteuil told Valmont she still loves him, I simply doubt it because it's not convincing.
Secondly, the ending is so bad. In particular, the duel scene between Valmont and Decenary happens so suddenly and I get lost why Valmont wanted to kill himself like this. He seems lost his mind after he found out Merteuil was in bed with Dacenary. But as I just mentioned, you won't believe Valmont is so in love with Merteuil that he wants to die instead.
I have also watched the big hit done by Milos Forman V Amadeus. In terms of production quality, it's not worse than Amadeus. I think Valmont deserved a better rating as its a delightful and sweet movie with specular scenary. It just came in bad timing.",1053648000,6,2133,4.4832904884318765

Anyway, while it is an ok movie (totally no re-watch value)....ALL COLIN FIRTH fans BEWARE!!! There is a specific icky scene in the movie where he seduces a young girl of 15(and she really looks fifteen if not younger!).  Anyway, I now want to go bang my head up against a tree until I have amnesia so I can forget this part!  So if your wanting this movie to see the charming Mr. Darcy, Mark Darcy, Earnest Worthing, or the newest... Henry Dashwood, Then DON'T waste your money!!!

369743,3,6301697723,"This movie was an interesting version of the novel it is unfortunate that the timing had it come after the stronger Frears film.
When I first saw this film I liked it well enough but I watched it again recently and found myself laughing in too many places that I shouldn't have.
I do agree with the folks that say Cecile and Dauceny in this are better cast. While I liked Uma and Keanu they were both much to old to play the parts.
I've also read the book and the fact is that the book is actully a series of letters between the characters. (Many of the main charcters actually never even physicaly meet.)The end of the Forman version has nothing to do with the original plot. The Frears version doesn't complete the ending either but it is far more acurate.
It is hard to say why I now find this movie very funny but I do think there is some rather severe overacting being done by both Benning and Firth.
If you like Colin Firth I truly cannot recomend this film, watch Pride and Prejudice, Bridget Jones Diary or Circle of Friends to truly see his talents!
I've had some further thoughts about this film...I disagree with folks about the ages and ""Prettiness"" of the Colin v. John and Annette vs. Glenn and here is why, unlike DL the cast of Valmont is in fact too pretty. Why does a man have to be physically beuatiful to carry of Valmont? And the ages are not as far off as you think. John M. was 33-34 when DL was made and Glenn Close was 39-40. It should not matter since people of that era died much younger and looked far less atractive than we do now, ESPECIALLY the rich, who indulged themselves to grossness. Why do you think the Revolution happend soon after the events of this film? What is laughable to me is the comments that Frears film is more Hollywood than Formans, umm why? Frears used accomplished actors who were in the proper age range, with a couple of exceptions, who did not rely on great physical 20th century beauty but extremely strong character and personality. I realy like Colin Firth but JM exudes a confidence and strengh of character that Firth does not in this film. Valmont is an ACCOMPLISHED seducer, and it is far more convincing to me to see Malcovich, who doesn't look like a GQ model accomplish this than Firth. The same goes for Benning who did not convince me at all that she was capable of half the stuff Merteuil did as much as Glenn was capable of...",1046390400,5,2397,4.376681614349776

Valmont was one of the Worst movies I have Ever seen! There was no plot development or character development, the whole movie was choppy and confusing, so many questions were left unanswered, Annette Benning was incredibly annoying, some of the characters had accents and some didn't (which was just careless and made the movie less beleiveable), And the worst thing was that the explaination on the back of the movie had nothing to do with what actually happened in the movie. The back of the DVD actually told the story of Dangerous Liasons... however, in Valmont, he does not fall in love with the girl who is part of the bet... instead he screws her over and leaves her in the rain! Every character in this movie was so unbearable that it was hard to watch. What is sad is that my mom and I bought this movie because we are so in love with Colin Firth. All I can say is that I hope he regrets being part of such a disaster of a movie.

369747,5,6301697723,"""Valmont"" (a costume drama set in pre-revolution aristocratic France) has passed the test of time and now stands supreme in any comparison with any other movies inspired by Choderlos de Laclos' novel ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"".  Please MGM, as welcome as this very good quality DVD is, a remastered DVD with some imformative extras next time!
For the fortunate uninitiated who still have this deliciously dark tale to view, ""Valmont"" has a simple enough story: Gercourt (the primal but possibly NOT the consummate schemer and betrayer of this story) ends his love affair with Madame de Merteuil. Madame de Merteuil learns why (and also the extent of time over which this breakup was PLANNED to happen) and smilingly decides upon vengeance. First, she enlists the ""consummate master of the art of seduction"" Valmont; then, she betrays her position as social custodian of the ""so innocent, so unprepared"" C&eacute;cile. C&eacute;cile has been kept in a convent/nunnery since the age of 11 until of an age to be married to ... guess whom? Yes! Gercourt (who ""seems obsessed by C&eacute;cile's purity and virginity""). Madame de Merteuil's basic revenge for Gercourt is, as she informs Valmont, ""I want to make him the laughing stock of Paris!"" However, the revenge story is given almost psychopathic dimensions of malice once Madame de Merteuil and Valmont turn on each other! All this vengeance can be viewed against a backdrop that offers not only betrayed love, passionate romantic love, and blind youthful easily-abused love but, also, the full tragedy of unrecognized love!
The actors are great and grow more into character with each viewing but something more must be said about the radiance of Fabia Drake as Madame de Rosemonde! Cinema seldom offers such exquisite dignity, grandeur, and perfection of posture, expression and spoken script!  She alone is worth the DVD admission price; yet, the same can be said of each actor/actress in the ""Valmont"" cast! Nonetheless, something more still needs to be said about Fabia Drake! She performs with some inexpressible artistic glory that, once seen, can actually be totally loved (yes, loved!) rather than simply admired in overwhelmed and entranced silence! Anyhow, to move on ... everyone in the excellent cast seems perfectly tuned, psychologically and emotionally, by Milos Forman, the director.  Forman ensures every nuance of innocence collides and dances with every subtlety of malice until all conflict can only be resolved in the embrace of a greater drama and eventual tragedy/victory.  The sheer mix in ""Valmont"" of patience, mystery, mastery, manipulation, humor, sadism, exhilaration, and despair; yet, such charm and civility too! Truly a dark emotional symphony by Milos Forman who received an Oscar for his direction of Amadeus. Arguably, he deserved equal or greater recognition for ""Valmont"" because he achieved so much more emotionally and psychologically with these characters. Who knows, though, perhaps Mozart's symphonic genius helped him find the tonal genius to orchestrate this charming and magnificent masquerade of vengeful malice!

I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first released in late 1989, and to this day I very clearly remember that I was downright angry when I walked out of the movie theatre - all because of the story. I was incredulous; how could they kill off the handsome leading male character who, when you got right down to it, was really a good man! [how amazing for a movie to elict such a strong emotion! - obviously I was not familiar with the story prior to seeing the movie.] ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" by Choderlos de Laclos is a story about selfish, manipulative, bored aristocrats. It is also a story about love. This film adaptation is beautifully filmed with lavish sets and gorgeous costumes. Colin Firth, Annette Bening, and Meg Tilly are fantastic.  Their performances are graceful, elegant and very subtle.
In regards to the DVD specifically, it has only the usual basic DVD features, there are no 'extras' such as director commentary, etc. The color and sound quality are excellent. The only negative comment I have regarding the DVD itself has to do with a missing scene, which is on the VHS tape and was shown in the theatrical release. The scene referred to takes place toward the end of the film where Valmont sneaks into Mdme. de Tourvel's home, slips past her husband and leaves a bouquet of flowers on her bed. Without a word spoken, so much is communicated about Valmont's character to the movie's audience. Its ashame this scene was not included. Note to whomever made this DVD: Did you think its absence wouldn't be noticed? Why would you cut out scenes that were in the original movie, when there is plenty of physical space on the DVD disk itself?",1033689600,9,1733,4.626623376623376

Just think, CF could play the son born to Cecille and continue on the tradition. Finally, my dvd is here!!!  The missing scene is most distressing and I would like an explanation as to why it was deleted off the dvd.  Otherwise, the dvd is more beautiful and lush than my vhs, but it was probably wore out.

369760,5,6301697723,"""Valmont"" is one of my favorite films of all time. It is so lovely to look at, with lavish sets, lovely country locations, exquisitely crafted costumes, and brilliant production design, that I have literally watched it over and over again. When you watch this movie, you are transported into the luxury of 17th Century aristocratic France. It also skillfully integrates music into the production, when Cecile and Madame de Merteuile go to the Opera, or when Cecile is performing songs with her harp. Of course, I want to make it clear to you right now that all reviews claiming that ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is a better film than Valmont are dead wrong! It is truly a tragic circumstance when a film as beautiful as ""Valmont"" is overlooked because of an inferior product such as ""DL"", just because ""DL"" came out first. Colin Firth is so much more likeable and dashing than John Malkovich. Annette Bening is much better than Glenn Close. In fact, the entire cast is perfect, as is every other detail of this movie, thanks to Director Milos Forman (the quality of this film is no accident). There are also fine supporting performances by Henry Thomas, Jeffrey Jones, Sian Phillips, and the last performance of the legendary Fabia Drake, who steals all the scenes she's in. But what you have to understand about ""Valmont"" is that it's a different kind of movie than ""DL"". ""Dangerous Liaisons"" was a cold, sinister, mean-hearted film. ""Valmont"" is gay, light-hearted at times, sad, tragic and heartbreaking at others. But it is never cold, and is always beautiful. And I will never neglect to say that Meg Tilly, as Madame de Tourville, is the most lovely, beautiful, and perfect creature to have ever graced the silver screen. Forget about all other actresses, Meg Tilly is the one for me. If only this movie would come out on DVD, because it is so beautiful to look at it really deserves to be on disc.",1020038400,22,1896,4.76595744680851
369761,5,6301697723,"Even though Milos Forman's version of this movie was criticized for being an exact copy of the Stephen Frears version, I like ""Valmont"" because it had a better cast than ""Dangerous Liasons"".
First of all, Glenn Close looks too old for her role as Mdme. de Merteuil. I did like her in her role ""In the Gloaming""  but, she had to wear face powder at the Opera to hide her age. Swoozie Kurtz looked awful in her costume. And while we are on the subject of being too old, Uma Thurman did not convince me that she could pass for 15.  I liked Fairuza Balk as Cecile because she looked the part of an innocent 15 year-old, even though she was 14. Also, she could sing better than Uma Thurman.  Thurman really squeaked when she hit the high notes during her solo, which hurt my ears.  John Malkovich disappointed me as the suave Vicomte de Valmont. It's the age thing again.  His only saving grace is that he was vicious to Mdme. de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer).  She really was hurt by his rejection.  Meg Tilly played an excellent Mdme. de Tourvel. While we all know that Pfeiffer was older than she played, she convinced me of her naivete. Tilly may have been too old for her role, but she didn't have to wear a lot of make-up like Glenn Close and she looked better in her costume.
Yes, it did seem like Annette Benning as Mdme. de Merteuil smiled through most of her plan to get even with her ex-lover, but she didn't smile for too long.  Revenge may be a dish better served cold, but she couldn't handle the end result.  Her ex-lover had the last laugh, which served her right for being so vindictive and coniving.
The only beautiful people in ""Dangerous Liasons"" were Michelle Pfeiffer and Keanu Reeves, everyone else seemed to be miscast because of age and a little off the mark costume-wise.
Now my curiosity is peeked because I plan to hunt down the book and read it despite how I feel about the movie of the same name.  I also plan to buy ""Valmont"" in the future.",1017014400,,1964,4.3856749311294765
369762,4,6301697723,"It was highly unfortunate that this adaptation of 'Les Liasons Dangereux', a bigger movie with a bigger cast.  Although shot at the same time, the release date of 'Valmont' was shifted so that they wouldn't clash.  Many of the strengths of the movie lie in its writing, which has a great deal of light humour that certainly stops it ever getting bogged down or becoming too heavy.  It's a gorgeous story though, and this is a beautiful adaptation with some excellent photography.
It's a pity that the leads, excellent actors thought they are, are simply not suited to these roles.  After watching the BBC adaptation of 'Pride And Prejudice' though he's always remembered as Mr. Darcy.  Likewise, Annette Bening never seems bitter enough, smiling her way through the role.  Fortunately the young Fairuza Balk brings an endearing vulnerability to her role as the innocent Cecile and the rest of the cast are outstanding as well.
In making use of huge gardens, parks and lakes, there isn't quite the sense of the characters being trapped.  However, there's a passionate rich feeling that truly makes the audience believe that the two despicable rogues at the centre are truly enjoying themselves.  Consequently this gorgeous life of sexual politics is properly evoked.
The resultant tragedy isn't as moving as it might have been but the themes of true love and its clashes with marriage are certainly well done.  Yet maybe the ending is appropriate, done with a quiet melancholy that somehow seems appropriate.",1016323200,2,1507,5.020080321285141

  Colin Firth is flawless as the cad Valmont.  Although Valmont is not a very nice person in the story, this talented actor manages to get your sympathy for him.
  Not only was his performance flawless, but this movie was filmed when he was around twenty-seven, I understand,and he is flawlessly beautiful physically and so incredibly charming.

I wished that there would have been more anguish over Meg Tilly's return to her husband. I found out that Tilly and Firth actually had a real off screen affair after this movie and a resulting son Will(footnote) There is real magnetism between them.
I did not care for the ending though-Valmont should have suffered more emotionally for his crimes of the heart onscreen. Death was too good for such a scoundrel!
Annette Benning was both wonderfully devilish and charming and again more believable as a seductress.",1007683200,9,723,4.838709677419355
369765,4,6301697723,"Both ""Valmont"" and ""DL"" have their own merits.... but I personally find ""Valmont"" to be the better movie. REASONS:
1) Its perfect casting - especially Fairuza Balk as the  extremely naive and innocent 15-year old Cecile. You must  watch this movie to find out just how wonderfully charming and adoring she is.  By comparison, Uma Thurman's ""Cecile"" in ""DL"" seems too old and sophisticated for the character. Annette Benning is also brilliant as the calculating and scheming ""de Merteuil"". In ""Valmont"", de Merteuil appears more human - she shows both her good and bad sides i.e. she's not ALL bad/evil like  Glenn Glose's portrayal of the character in ""DL"". Colin Firth also makes for a more likeable and dashing Valmont than John Malkovich in ""DL"". I find Glenn Close and John Malkovich's portrayals to be too ""scary"" for anyone to be genuinely attracted to them. Their characters seem a little too cold and ""serpent-like"" to me.
2) The sets, cinematography and costumes in ""Valmont"" are more lavish and beautiful than in ""DL"". In ""Valmont"", there are more out-of door scenes e.g. the very lovely scene in the park where Valmont (Colin Firth) manages to coax the shy and proper Mdm de Tourveil (played by the luminous Meg Tilly) to get on the horse with him where he then proceeds to teach her archery, and the ensuing dance-and-picnic scene. In ""Valmont"", Cecile also plays the harp and sings a couple of beautiful songs.
3) A better screenplay and a more natural dialogue. This adaptation is also more detailed and thorough, and has more humour. Unlike in ""DL"" where the character of Gercourt (Cecile's fiance - a rich, older man) does not make an appearance at all, in ""Valmont"", his character (played to perfection by Jeffrey Jones) gets proper screen time. Also, Cecile's character is given more prominence here.
""Valmont"" runs for slightly over 2 hours. The last 15 minutes of the movie is a little dissapointing, though. The ending is rather different from the novel's. Another little complaint of mine is that Colin Firth's Valmont seems less passionate towards Mdm de Tourveil than he should be. Right up to the end of the movie, we don't see him being ""tormented by love"" at all. He doesn't seem to care much when he realizes that Mdm de Tourveil has left him and returned to her husband.
The ending in ""DL"" has more ""oomph!"" actually, although it is very disturbing. But, OVERALL, I find ""Valmont"" to be the more enjoyable adaptation as it is so... beautiful to watch and has many wonderful moments that will make the viewer laugh and cry.
Quite sad that while ""DL"" garnered many Oscar nominations, ""Valmont"" (being released just a year later), didn't do quite as well at the Oscars.
My advice: watch both versions!",1004745600,189,2727,4.832976445396145

If you preferred DL over this movie, then you probably don't appreciate Shakespeare either.  Sorry, but the truth hurts.",999475200,5,410,4.8428571428571425
369768,4,6301697723,"Neither Jean-Claude Carrire's screenplay, nor Milos Forman's direction could capture the suspense felt in the stage play by Choderlos de Laclos (""Les Liaisons Dangereuses""), or Stephen Frears' film ""Dangerous Liaisons"" with Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the two leading roles.
Notwithstanding, ""Valmont"" is a lush and beautifully filmed adaptation of this piece with a cast well worth watching the film for.
Visually, I think I prefer Forman's film to Frears', and certain performances are more layered in ""Valmont"". Annette Bening's smile is so winning that you can truly believe how people are duped by it, which makes it all the more shocking when she shows her ugly side. This is not to say that she's better in the role than Glenn Close was - just different. Both performances are brilliant.
Colin Firth's Valmont is a killer: his charm and sex appeal are like a Venus flytrap...you know they're dangerous, but you can't help being sucked in by them. He ultimately plays this very difficult role with more subtle layers than the brutally devastating performance that Malkovich gave. His Valmont is ultimately more likable as a person, despite his dastardly doings. This makes it easier to forgive him in the end.
No offense to Ulma Thurman, but I really did like the young lovers in Valmont better than in Dangerous Liaisons: Fairuza Balk as Cecile is perfect. Thurman (who is a wonderful actress) looked a tad too old to play a 15 year old and therefore her naivety comes across a being slightly dumb. Balk looks the right age and just comes off as one would imagine a teenage girl of that time and stature would be. Henry Thomas as Dancey is just heads over Keanu Reeves.
One does sorely miss Michelle Pfeiffer as Madame de Tourvel, since Meg Tilly is just so unfortunately miscast in the role. Whereby you can certainly understand why she throws all precaution to the wind and starts an affair with Colin Firth's Valmont, you simply can't understand what he possibly could see in her bland approach to this complex character.
Dangerous Liaisons just has a better script with much more tension and suspense than Valmont, but give this one a look - you won't be wasting your time.",998784000,4,2190,4.858288770053476
369779,5,6301697723,"*applause*  I am in total agreement with you regarding this movie as opposed to Dangerous Liasons (DL).  Valmont was SO much better.  I feel that DL was incredibly ""Hollywoodized"" and the actors played up the roles beyond what they should have been.  I am not sure Glenn Close's character in DL SHOULD have been so cold and sly.  The point was that she was NOT a cold-hearted sociopath, but that there were many complex emotions between her and Vamont that she did not care to deal with.  There is a much better sense of that in Valmont than in DL.  Also, the character played by Tilly in Valmont wasn't supposed to be ""tragically beautiful"" as a critic put it.  I felt the role was much more suited to Tilly's naive innocence...in a desperate attempt to NOT fall in love with Valmont, she was incredibly vulnerable.
I am glad to know I'm not the only one who thought Valmont was a much better rendition than DL.",998352000,,912,4.484848484848484
369780,5,6301697723,"While the movie ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (a literal translation of Choderlos Laclos's novel ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"") was also much more literal in following the plot of the book, I found it disappointing.  It had a good script, a good cast, but no soul.  John Malkovich was not Valmont, Glenn Close was not Madame de Merteuil, and I couldn't remotely envision either of them generating sparks either off each other or anyone else.  But Milos Forman's reworking of ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" as the movie ""Valmont"" is a success all around, and a much better film than its predecessor.
There are two areas in which the movie departs radically from the book.  I always thought the ending of the book was too slanted toward the need to show that crime does not pay, and hence Madame de Merteuil gets her comeuppance in a disastrous lawsuit which reduces her to penury and a confluent smallpox which makes a transfigures her beauty into ugliness (""her soul is visible on her face"").  In ""Valmont"", however, Forman realizes that evil often wins out, after a fashion, and so we have Madame de Merteuil, if not flaunting it over her rivals, still able to be herself and continue her life of malicious intrigue.  The story opens when Madame de Merteuil, to revenge herself on being dumped by her lover the Count de Gercourt, who is going to marry Cecile de Volanges, a young girl right out of the convent whom he prizes for her innocence and virginity (a polar opposite from Madame de Merteuil who is amorality itself), maneuvers Valmont, her old friend and former lover, to seduce Cecile before her marriage, so that Gercourt will realize on his wedding night that he is getting damaged goods after all.  Annette Bening was devastating in this role.  She brought out all of the Madame de Merteuil's superficial charm which captivated so many people, and her underlying deviousness and soullessness.  Colin Firth, who was hopelessly miscast as Darcy in the A&E production of ""Pride and Prejudice"", was just right as Valmont; unlike Malkovich, whose portrayal of Valmont was purely one-dimensional, Firth also showed the character's vulnerability and sensitivity which he tried to mask behind his cynicism.  And Fairuza Balk was a delight as Cecile de Volanges; one wants to ask how anyone over the age of seven could be so hopelessly naive.  But the biggest treat in this movie is Fabia Drake as Madame de Rosemonde, Valmont's old aunt.  In the book, Madame de Rosemonde is a saintly contrast to Valmont's predatory selfishness; in this movie, she is wickedly funny and much more in sync with her nephew than she is in the book.  (There is a delicious bit near the movie's end where Madame de Rosemond and Cecile share a joke at Gercourt's expense, right in the middle of Cecile's wedding.)
The second area where the movie and the book part company is the fate of Madame de Tourvel.  Madame de Tourvel is the faithful wife who finally surrenders, against her better judgement, to the man she loves; only to discover that she has been used and abandoned.  In the book, this so devastates her that she retires to a convent and dies of a broken heart.  In the movie, however, she follows Valmont out of desperation, gets him to take her back into his bed for one more night, and coming to her senses in the morning, abandons him as he had previously left her, returning to her husband.  Valmont is a truly pitiable figure at this point, especially when he realizes that Madame de Merteuil has played him far more effectively than he thought he was playing Madame de Tourvel; Firth's acting in this movie makes us sympathize with Valmont, whereas Malkovich just made us glad he got what was coming to him.
In the end, ""Valmont"" is not ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" and it doesn't try to be.  It's a reworking of the book on its own merit, and it stands up brilliantly.",997401600,10,3851,4.756756756756757
369781,5,6301697723,"I liked this better than Dangerous Liaisons which came out at about the same time.  Of course Dangerous Liaisons was very good, and John Malkovich, who played Vicomte de Valmont, is an actor of power, and Glenn Close, who played the Marquise de Merteuil, is highly accomplished, but I preferred the charm of Colin Firth in this film to the brutality of Malkovich, and I thought Annette Bening was just delightful.  She played Merteuil with exquisite timing and an ironic witchery and warmth that I shall not soon forget.  I preferred her playful, sly wit to Close's cool cynicism.

The story comes from a novel by Choderlos de Laclos set in 18th century France that was made into a stage play by Christopher Hampton.  It is a cynical satire on human sexuality as well as a very subtle examination of sexual hypocrisy and desire, a kind of oh so sophisticated laugh at bourgeois morality that would have delighted Voltaire and Moliere and greatly amused Shakespeare.  It is a tale of elaborate lechery and revenge that backfires because it seems that anybody, even the most jagged rake can fall in love, and thereby become the victim.  The central assumption here is the same as that of the Cavalier poets, namely that marriage kills love.  As Merteuil says, ""You don't marry your lover.""

Meg Tilly played Madame de Tourvel with subtlety and a riveting passion.  One of the great sequences in the movie occurs after she has fallen madly in love with Valmont against her will.  She stands outside his doorway in the rain for hours looking adoringly and forlornly up at his window.  And then she is allowed to enter and receive a cool reception.  Valmont says, ""Do you want me to lie to you?"" and she replies desperately, ""Yes,"" and then it is her passion that overwhelms him, leading to a beautifully ironic twist.  Shortly afterward he sees Merteuil, who has become more like a sister than an ex-lover, and says, ""I feel awful.""  She replies, ""Are you surprised? [Pause] You are an awful man.""  Hanging his head he continues, ""Do you think a man can change?""  ""Yes. [Pause]  For the worse.""

This theme, that it is the beloved who has the power and that once you fall in love you lose all power, is repeated several times in the movie.  Valmont pursues women, the harder to get the better, with a relentless and maniacal passion, but once he has them, he immediately loses interest.  His making love absentmindedly to Cecile de Volanges (played with wide-eyed innocence and girlish charm by Fairuza Balk) was an incredible irony when we consider what she would cost Gercourt, played with his rather substantial nose in the air by Jeffrey Jones, whom you may recall as the pratfalling principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986).

There is some insidious philosophy here, some sardonic observations on human nature worth mentioning.  One is that the man beloved of women gets most of the reproductive tries, and regardless of his rakishness, is still beloved.  Another is that duplicity is the accepted, even required, standard of behavior in society, and that when it comes to sex, one must, perforce, always lie.

Milos Forman's direction was invisible and therefore a work of art.  The incidental scenes and backdrops depicting the color, squalor and decadence of pre-revolutionary France added just the right amount of atmosphere.  The costumes were stunning and much cleaner than they would have been in reality.  The elegance and beauty of all the titled people merrily contrasted with the crude ugliness of the common people, rightly reflecting the effete snobbery of the aristocracy before the time of the guillotine.

ORIGINAL UPDATED REVIEW 2001:

This movie was over shadowed by ""Dangerous Liasons"" which was released within a year of each other, much the same way the two films about Truman Capote were released within a year of each other, ""Capote"" eclipsed ""Infamous"" in its success and accolades.  I enjoyed both of the the films based off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-liaisons-dangereuses/dp/2745941534/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les liaisons dangereuses</a>&nbsp;equally for different reasons.

The main problems with Valmont would be its casting;  Michelle Pfeiffer's take on Madame de Tourvel in ""Dangerous Liasons (DL for short)"" outdoes Meg Tilly's in Valmont, the problem with Meg Tilly is, she always comes across very coldly and completely unsympathetic, and never quite seems to be able to portray genuine emotion. John Malkovich was, while I love John Malkovich, comes off as a bit too slimy to really be charming in DL, though in ""Valmont"" Firth probably isn't slimy enough, and Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors.  Some of the casting is right on in ""Valmont"", Annette Benning's take on Marquise de Merteuil is more effective than Glen Close' in DL as there is more depth in the script in Valmont for the character, and Benning comes off less as pure manipulator and more as a real person than Close did.  As well as Feruza Balk as Cecile de Volanges exudes far more warmth and youthfulness than did Uma Thurman.

The film ""Valmont"" almost seems to romanticize what Valmont's character is, which is a flaw of the script as it changes some of the events that teach us who Valmont is as a person, but at the same time, Valmont as a person is also more fleshed out in general in this script and the motivations of his character make more sense.  In retrospect, I would say it is best to watch both, then read the play and see which version you feel best represents the text, both are equally good for different reasons.

369783,4,6301697723,"It almost seems unfair comparing ""Valmont"" with ""Dangerous Liasons.""  Both films have their merits, and while they may tell the same story, they are vastly different - both with their strengths and weaknesses.  If one prefers high psychological drama, then the Stephen Frears version with Glenn Close and an John Malcovich is the one to see.
The problem for me is that I don't see this story as high drama or one in which the main characters should be so devoid of whimsy.  This is a bawdy 18th century romp, and Milos Forman comes much closer to telling the tale in a way that makes the point still come across, but is passionate and fun to watch at the same time.
Much has been said of the casting differences.  It comes down to this for me:  Colin Firth's Valmont is sexy.  He is charming and alluring.  He is not the consummate villain as is Malcovich's Valmont.  I had a problem in the Frears version of finding anything particularly seductive about Malcovich's Valmont.  All I got from him was the vileness of the character.  Firth's Valmont is at times petulant, passionate, spoiled, sweet, bitter, cruel, and kind, but always seductive.  He plays all the colors of Valmont's rainbow.  In Malcovich's I felt only the darkness of the character.
The same can be said of Annette Bening's Madame Merteuil.  She is flirty and holds her malevolence in check, letting it out in small, well thought out doses.  She is passionate and sexy.  You can understand why Firth's Valmont wants so badly to possess her.  There was nothing sexy or alluring about Glenn Close's Merteuil.
I also found the casting of Fairuza Balk and Henry Thomas to be improvements on Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves.  Both were wide-eyed innocents, something I didn't get from their predecessors.
Meg Tilly was perhaps the weakest link in the cast, but she was fine for the role.  She and Firth had chemistry and she portrayed Madame de Tourval's growing passion for Valmont with a naivte that was charming.
Passion is the key element for me that ""Valmont"" has but ""Dangerous Liasons"" lacks.  Both are fine films, but I ended watching ""Valmont"" feeling I had had great, bawdy fun and completely understanding the allure each character had for each other!",992217600,13,2222,4.769633507853404
369784,1,6301697723,"I hate to do it, but there is no way anyone can watch this movie without comparing it to Stephen Friers' Dangerous Liaisons with John Malkovich and Glenn Close. Friers' rendition is without a doubt more sophisticated and far superior. John Malkovich IS Valmont. He and only he may be able to combine deadly charm with tragic repentence in a way that blends seemlessly into a character. Colin Firth lacked this ability. He played Valmont for face value where there was the potential for so much more. But given what he had to worth with (cast, script) who could blame him. The rest of the cast is dull and crass to the point where it makes you want to burst out laughing at even the most ""intense"" scenes. Annette Benning was particularily weak in comparsion to Glenn Close's superbe portrayal of the Valmont's confidant. But the worst of the bunch is Meg Tilly. Not only did she deliver her lines with the same effect as reading them from cue cards held in front of her face, but her appearence and demeanor did not hold true to the character -Madame de Tourvel. Everytime anything came out of her mouth I wondered where I kept my duct tape. Her performance and beauty does not hold a candle to that of Michelle Pfeiffer. All in all, you're much better off investing in the other version.",987724800,6,1288,4.556034482758621
369785,3,6301697723,"This movie disappointed and unsettled me in the sense that it managed to shaken my devotion and admiration for Colin Firth.  (Yes, I admit I watched this movie primarily because of him).  Playing the title role, Firth is supposed to be an unrepentant, cunning and charming womanizer capable of ruining any woman's virtue. Oh, he is handsome, all right--no one can deny that--but he flashes his teeth far too often and far too boyishly.  Not as calculating and virile as John Malkovich's version, Firth's Valmont comes across as a rather clumsy, half-witted dandy who creates a series of laughing-out-loud scenes: we get to witness him tripping himself all over the place, getting stuck at the door by his dangling sword, pretending to faint right into a lake in an attempt to woo his subject of pursuit, and the list goes on.  And this made me wonder if the movie VALMONT is actually a farce which happens to bear a very similar story line to  Choderlos de Laclos's ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses""......
In addition to Colin Firth's unconvincing Valmont, Annette Bening's version of the scheming, evil countess strikes me as one-dimensional and too sweet. VALMONT also suffers a lack of a sense of suspense and tension that had kept me riveted when I watched DANGEROUS LIASONS.  The pace of the movie is slow and the characterization a bit off.  I cannot say that I enjoyed VALMONT half as much as I did DANGEROUS LIASONS.",985305600,16,1417,4.830578512396694

However, the casting in Valmont is far superior (with the exception of Meg Tilly).  I found John Malkovich repulsive and reptilian--he didn't convince me that he was a rake who could charm a virtuous woman.  Colin Firth, however, was very sexy and suprisingly vulnerable as Valmont.  Annette Benning was great--playful, conniving, and beautiful.  Glenn Close looks dried up and past her prime in comparison.  I was actually most suprised by Fairuza Balk.  Her role was meatier than Uma Thurman's.  While Uma was stiff and (imo she can't act), Fairuza was fresh, young, and talented.  I heard she was only 14 when she filmed this!  The only casting I didn't like was Meg Tilly.  She was weak and very stilted.  It almost seemed like she had a hard time just saying her lines.  No chemistry with Colin Firth whatsoever.  Michelle Pfieffer was infinitely more tragic and tortured.
