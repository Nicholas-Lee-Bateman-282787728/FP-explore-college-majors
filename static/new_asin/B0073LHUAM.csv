8509339,1,B0073LHUAM,Mine did not have the book with it. It was a VCR tape only. The seller did refund my money which was very nice of her but it was useless without the book. I really thought Bob Dylan was going to show us how to play his songs but it was some other guy who knows Bob Dylan. So I was disappointed in the book all in all and tossed it in the air where it is Blowing in the Wind.,1389052800,,374,3.6296296296296298
