Masahiro is a kind, hard-working boy whose Second Sight was sealed away by his own grandfather while he was a tiny child.  Masahiro, who despite being named successor of his grandfather Abe no Seimi, --a very powerful onmyouji (priest who drives away evil beings)-- has spent his life in his grandfather's shadow, and he hates it.  Everyone expects great things from him not because he shows any ability (in fact, he even tries different careers) but simply because he's ""Abe no Seimi's grandson"".

One day he meets a rabbit-like creature he names Mokkun, who can talk and becomes very protective of the Masahiro.  Soon the two are battling demons, and when Mokkun's life is in danger, Masahiro's second sight returns.  He also learns that Mokkun is in fact Guren, one of the 12 shikigami--ancient powerful beings (who look human) who have chosen to serve his grandfather, a man who won their love and trust.  The shikigami are reluctant to transfer their loyalty to Masahiro because they don't want to admit that Abe no Seimi is getting old and will, like all humans, eventually die.

This anime series is unusual in that there are several distinct story arcs, with an underlying plot that ties up nicely in the end.  One storyarc is about how Masahiro wins the love of a princess (who has a strong second sight herself) while battling a huge winged tiger-demon, one is about exorcising the spirits of dead people, and the underlying story is about a tragedy that occurred between Guren and the grandfather 50 years ago, during a battle with an enemy who they thought had been defeated...

One thing I appreciate about this series is that most people behave realistically.  I get tired sometimes of the over-the-top reactions from a lot of anime characters.  The other students at Masahiro's apprentice hall don't insult him to his face or physically bully him, but rather make comments that are subtle insults, and Masahiro doesn't get mad because he can understand things from their point of view, and he responds in a refreshingly mature, respectful way.  (Actually, it's Mokkun who gets angry.)  I also love the period clothing, the kimonos and onmyouji garb, which may or may not be realistic with the bright colors used (Japan had silk a few hundred years ago, right?  Wasn't silk often dyed very bright colors, at least for people of high rank?)

What I like best about this series is the strong bond that grows between Masahiro and Mokkun/Guren.  Immortal Guren has spent his life sullen and angry to the point that even the other shikigami avoid him/fear him, but when baby Masahiro treats him with love, not fear, violent Guren slowly grows gentler and more content.  As Mokkun, he shows a playful, teasing side he could never express as the human-like Guren, and even loses his temper in a way that makes me laugh--he stands up on his rabbit-like hind legs and stamps his little rabbity foot!

Oh, and watch this in Japanese--both Mokkun and Masahiro sound like girls in English, and the grandfather was voiced by a young guy who was trying to sound old, but the gravelly voice he uses is disturbing--makes me feel like I have to clear my throat just listening to him.  One last niggling detail--since this series was done in the last days of Geneon company before it died, the quality control for the subtitles wasn't as good as usual.  I caught many grammar mistakes.",1269907200,,3500,4.788685524126456
