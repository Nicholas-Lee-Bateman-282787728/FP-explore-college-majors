1377685,4,B00004YRX1,"""Cry of the Banshee"" is not Vincent Price's better films but it is a lot of fun to watch.  Price plays a judge on a mission to kill all of the local witches in 16th-century England.  Problem is that he is way too eager to put anyone to death at the slightest hint that they are a witch.  What motivates him is a local coven of witches that have selected him and his family as their enemy and have placed a curse on them.  He seeks to rid the town of the witches to save himself at any cost.  This movie is full of creepy atmosphere and has a nice twist ending.  Its always to watch Vincent Price in action so fans of his will definitely have fun watching ""Cry of the Banshee"".",1363046400,,676,4.045112781954887
1377686,4,B00004YRX1,"Cry of the Banshee is probably the least popular Vincent Price horror film but it's one of my favorites. aside from Price's usual great acting, what sells me on the movie is the mood and atmosphere of the film. i see nothing wrong with AIP capitalizing on the witchcraft genre with this, ""The Oblong Box"", and ""Conqueror Worm"". i liked all those movies, too. the trouble that most people have is that the stereotypical 'Vincent Price' isn't to be seen in these witch hunter flicks and for some reason, people can't learn to curl up on a cold day or a stormy night and plop in this rainy day movie and simply enjoy it for the entertainment. so what if the storyline sounds run of the mill or boring? on this film, Price plays Lord Edward Whitman whose family is cursed by Oona, a local witch. The Whitman boys and the only daughter look strinkingly similar to walk-ons and bit players on ""The Oblong Box"" and ""Conqueror Worm""...well, the story tells about Oona sending a banshee to shack up with the Whitman's. i love the scene in which Price whips the stranger/banshee after catching him messing around with the daughter! i loved the hilarious ending that shows Price hop into his horse and buggy without noticing the driver falling over dead! the 'new' driver is none other than the banshee and as the horse and carriage speed off into the country side, we hear Price yelling ""Bully Boy? Bully Boy..."" and we see a close-up on the Banshee grinning! in a nut shell, Vincent Price films are always filled with great ACTING...this always wins over a bad script in my opinion. i feel that Vincent was right on the mark as the leader of this sadistic family and his cruel performance doesn't let you have any sympathy for him until the scene in which his entire family has been killed and you're rooting him on to go and kill Oona! this doesn't rank on the same level as the Roger Corman directed Poe films and it's unfair to compare ""Cry of the Banshee"" to any of them. for one thing, Banshee and the other witch-hunter films are in another genre and deserve to be compared with other witch movies...i'm afraid that many people see blood and gore and assume 'horror' which isn't the case on the witch-hunter movies. these are more like religious cult than true horror.",1043539200,7,2265,4.5675675675675675
1377687,1,B00004YRX1,"Cry of the Banshee represents a low point in Vincent Price's acting career.  I suppose that this is considered one of his Poe-based movies since they throw on a Poe quote at the beginning, but it has no real ties to the other movies in this series.
Similar to the flawed but still far superior Conqueror Worm, this movie has Vincent Price as the magistrate of a village who revels in his cruelty towards supposed witches.  When he angers a real witch, a curse is visited upon him.  If this sounds interesting in theory, it is not in execution.
Price looks like he is walking through his role, and despite his wooden acting, he is still the best in the bunch.  Bad acting and writing makes this movie bad enough, but what kills it is that it's boring.
The only mildly interesting thing about this movie is the opening credit sequence, with Monty Python-style animation by Terry Gilliam, but even this misleads you into thinking that this movie might have some humor, which it doesn't.  The only other good thing about this movie is it is relatively short (90 minutes) so it does eventually come to an end.",1033862400,2,1104,4.555555555555555
1377688,2,B00004YRX1,"You know those great classic horror films that grab your interest right away and hold you glued to the screen for the nexthour and a half or so? Well, this film is not one of those, but it is not one of the other kind either. This film can best be described as uneven, although the good slightly outweighs the bad.
The plot is Vincent Price and his soldiers break up a pagan ceremony (complete with lots of young people dancing around in bedsheets) and kill a couple of the participants. The woman they say is a witch puts a curse on Price and his family, she also sommons a ""man"" who is supposed to bring this revenge around. Price and his followers hear strange sounds that they at first think are howls of a wolf, although they sound more like cross between a warped audio tape and someone stomach after they ate something that did not agree with them at all. Eventually the curse goes into effect and Price tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it.
  The story is nothing new and puts together aspects of previous Price classics Masque of the red death and the Conqueror Worm. The costumes, sets and acting are overall good. The film has some good action and some scary parts, but the parts with the witch and sound of the banshee just makes me shake my head and wonder what the producer thought was beneficial about these scenes? The idea of a banshee is very interesting to me, but the horrible sounds are not impressive. When I actually see the creature, I could not believe their budget only allowed them halloween grease paint probably purchased at a local drug store. The film could have been called cry of the wolf or werewolf because they completely lose sight of what a banshee is. However, they do pull this one out with a good ending and by using Vincent Price more than a lot of films did at this point in his career.
  In all fairness, I would have given this film two and a half is I could because it is certainly interesting enough to be average. This is one of three Vincent price films directed by Gordon Hessler and it is definitely better than the boring Oblong box and the sci-fi/horror stinker Scream and scream again.",978566400,13,2158,4.401002506265664

1377748,1,B00004YRX1,"Cry of the Banshee, 1970 film

This is set in the Tudor dynasty. A maid is tortured to get her to confess. Found guilty, she will be whipped until her back is bloody then placed in the stocks. The reaction of the people isn't too different from the Jerry TV show. [Most people are happy when they can hate somebody.] A man tells of sheep killed by something. A young woman and man are captured and brought in for entertainment. They hear a wail from outside - a wolf or a banshee? [A banshee was some sort of witch whose wailing foretold of an imminent death.] When the young couple resist the brother is stabbed dead and his sister shot. Murder says a woman; she is told to hold her tongue. Is this house cursed Elsewhere a hanged man is cut down. A man returns from abroad with a new priest. New witches spread out all the time.

They must continue to stamp out heathen practices. People hear howling. Is it the wolves? People are warned about a mad dog in the street. It threatens a young girl, but a man drives it away. Some charm? Is it witchcraft? Later we see people in a tavern. A man sings about random love. Men play with a serving wench. A Lord exercises his power over people. One young woman sells her charms to customers. She is interrogated to get the name of their leader. The leaders find a group of men and women performing some pagan rites in the woods. They are attacked. Will Oona curse Edward Whitman and his descendants? She calls for an avenger. He appears with a clap of thunder! He has a medallion about his throat. At night riders approach a ruined church. One falls off. Then he hears howling. The other riders hear his scream and find his body. They must find and destroy that dog. [Does this remind you of The Hound of the Baskervilles?]

They find and shoot that dog. This leads to another celebration, dancing, and drinking. Witchcraft had nothing to do with that mad dog. Lord Whitman dances with a young woman. She acts strange when she sees the head of that dog. Is she bewitched of mad? The Lord commands the capture of Oona. Where is she? Torture is used to make her talk. Two men fight for control. [This [phony action pads out the story.] She talks of a plague to curse the Whitman family. Oona performs a ritual to punish the Whitmans. Will it work?

Whitmans wife Patricia finds out. Whitman rides to an old cemetery. A young woman is tortured to get information about Oona. Whitman returns to find Roderick in his bedroom! Her is put in chains. Oona and her fans perform their rites in a secret grotto. The priest intrudes and hears Oona boast of her power of witchcraft. Has the power of the witched been broken? There is a fight outside Maureens chamber. A shot hits Roderick, they leave the house and the curse behind. What is in that coffin? You didn't kill him! There is another surprise for Lord Whitman.

This was filmed in Middlesex England. Does it have a recreated village? This is a good example of a movie where they skimped on a story and spent money on a recreated costume drama. Did you ever see a worse historical movie? This was the century of the Tudor Dynasty (Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I). Henry VII came to power by killing the last Plantagenet King, Richard III. They were followed by the Stuart dynasty, James I, Charles I, and Charles II. A popular revolt ended their reign. Does part of this story remind you of the legend used in The Hound of the Baskervilles?",1431820800,,3435,4.42879746835443

1377755,2,B00004YRX1,"Cry of the Boobies would be a more appropriate title

Some truly gorgeous women in this one and if you like gratuitous nudity, this one's for you. Boobs are in abundance.

Vincent Price (love him) can be very hammy, but is more restrained here. While the acting by all is good, the same can't be said for the characters. There's no one to like, no one to cheer for. We have real witch hunters who are pseudo-Christian and very nasty and then we have, well, real witches, who are also nasty, though in a quasi-hippy kind of way. So pseudo and quasi are nicely represented as are several historical inaccuracies like flint-lock pistols with cylinders (!?!)

The music is quite engaging and may be by Les Baxter (according to IMDB) or Wilfred Josephs (according to the actual film credits) so there's a mystery far more engaging than the movie itself.

Terry Gilliam provides the entertaining title sequences.

I only made it half way through this movie before I remembered my life would be better spent cleaning the gutters. Still, I give it two stars for the above mentioned technical aspects.",1420070400,,1092,4.726315789473684

But, aside from the subject matter, the films are not too terribly similar, and I found CRY OF THE BANSHEE equally enjoyable as its predecessor.

There was a supposed demon that, to me, looked like a werewolf (at least it appeared to be furry).  The only howls were from wolves or dogs, in fact people in the film were warned about wolves.  While this movie was suppose to have a stamping out witch sub-theme, only several women died as a witch.  One was burned to death (wasn't a witch), one, after a trial, was put in the stock (she later died after she was out of the stock-I forget how?).  The only real witch was a woman with a hard to understand (German?) accent was killed after they killed most of her followers but then let her go.  She wouldn't leave well enough alone and I think a priest ending up killing her (very clumsy).  It appears that the director grew bored at this time and hurried up and just finished it.  The worse thing about the movie was while the humans didn't appear to be dubbed; sometimes the dogs and wolves howling and barking appear to be done by a human pretending to be a dog.

Gothic Horror set in the 16th Century.
Vincent Price plays Lord Edward Whitman, a local Magistrate who is on
a mission to wipe out witches.  He in fact does wipe out quite a few, but
makes a mistake in leaving the leader of the Coven alive, along with a few
of her coven.  She then proceeds to call up a Banshee, (Rodney), played by
Patrick Mower to wipe out the Whitman family.  Other than the Vincent Price
role, others of note are Essy Pearson who plays Lady Whitman and Hilary Heath
who plays the daughter, Maureen Whitman.  There are two sons, but of little note,
at least in my opinion.  One interesting fact is Sally Geeson, the younger sister of
Judy Geeson has a small role as Sarah.  The film gets a 5.5 rating on IMDb.  It is rated
R for violence and a bit of nudity, which probably helped this movie to get to a 5.5
rating.  It runs 1 hour and 31 minutes.  Not my all time favorite from Mr. Price, but worth
your time, if you like 70s horror and you are a fan of Vincent Price.  I will give it a 5 out of 10 stars.
