8314579,3,B000066RUE,"The art of the Vatican is very interesting, but the second DVD is misleadingly titled Rosary.  It is not a rosary, but only series of images of clay figurines and descriptions of the 20 mysteries of the Rosary.  Prayers are jumbled together and are incomplete.  Very disappointing when expecting a recitation of the most Holy Rosary.",1306800000,,333,4.910714285714286
8314580,3,B000066RUE,"I have a very good collection of DVDs centered on the Vatican, Rome, Pope John Paul II and many of them focus on the art and artistry of the city and of the Vatican.  I found this particular DVD a bit disappointing.  There was relatively no new information.  The text was a bit heavy handed in the direction of Catholic dogma, rather than focusing on the art.  The camera work was not as good as it could have been, nor was the lighting top notch.  It simply could have been better in all arenas.  Plus the DVD says it is 135 minutes long - that is not correct.  The first DVD runs about 45 minutes and the second DVD on the Rosary runs about 25 minutes....The second DVD on the Rosary again is a bit heavy in dogma and doesn't portray the artwork in what could have been a thrilling manner.  There are many other DVDs to choose from if you are interested in the art of Rome and the Vatican.  The information on the DVD case itself also is a bit misleading.",1280448000,7,957,4.185792349726776
8314581,4,B000066RUE,How enlightening that the artwork in the Vatican Library has so much to do with alphabets! Its not what I expected.,1243728000,,115,4.523809523809524
8314582,1,B000066RUE,"From the meager info provided by this website regarding this Vatican Library documentary, I decided to take a chance and purchase it, with the hope of using some of the images to visually enhance some of my art history lectures. (college classes)

What a disappointment! This tape is far from an informative documentary. Rather than specific focus on individual artists, craftsmen, and their work, this is a sentimental overview of the ""glories"" of the various popes, complete with backround music of heavenly choirs. A Waste of time and money!",1137283200,9,544,5.112359550561798
8314583,5,B000066RUE,I enjoyed this production immensively. It is a rich cultural treasury of great art. It has an Italian audio track as well as an English audio track. I would enjoy very much listening to the Italian audio track while looking at the English subtitles if there were any. I find this to be a minor but unfortunate defect in an otherwise excellent DVD.,1107820800,17,347,4.523809523809524
8314584,4,B000066RUE,Very good informative voice over and pictures of the rosary. A wonderful DVD for parents to watch with their children and to discuss the life of Christ and the prayers of the Rosary.,1046736000,,182,4.545454545454546
