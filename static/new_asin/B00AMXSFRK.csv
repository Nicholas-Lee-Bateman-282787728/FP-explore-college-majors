If you need a solid ending, though, this is not the movie for you because you never know what happens in the end to the evil character or the people on the island. The ending leaves you guessing. As for the bonus movies, they are all sick trash - not just blood and guts but twisted sicko themes.",1488585600,,447,4.090909090909091

5457595,3,B00AMXSFRK,I picked up this collection from the $5 bargain bin at Walmart. The main feature is a decent TV movie with some pretty good acting from a number of familiar faces. I didn't find the other six films very good but some viewers might enjoy them more than I did. This collection is not worth $20!,1472947200,,292,4.232142857142857
5457596,4,B00AMXSFRK,"First off, the 6 bonus films are 1-2 star films at best. They are themed into the ""storm"" idea and has allowed a repackaging and re-marketing of the main product, a made for TV film done in three episodes.

The story takes place on Little Tall Island...off the coast of Maine to no surprise to King fans. A stranger named Andre Linoge (Colm Feore) comes to the island needing a dentist, but instead kills old Martha Clarendon (Rita Tuckett) and watches her TV as two fronts come together as they are in for a ""storm of the century."" The stranger ends up in Constable Mike Anderson's (Tim Daly) jail...but strange things begin to happen and the stranger knows all of the island's dirty little secrets and is willing to share them with the whole town. He wants something to leave....

This is rather a long film. As far as Stephen King and religious themes, I liked ""1408"" better.  King did work a cameo as a lawyer on a flyer as he sometimes does. The phrase, ""Give me what I want and I will go away"" was eerily repeated, something King copied from himself (The Shining). Also King's other novel/character ""Dolores Claiborne"" is mentioned in this film, which took place in the same location.

The film is actually a short story made long by King to develop character...everyone's character. As far as entertainment about a film with a stranger, the plebeian in me likes ""Traveler"" with the fat Val Kilmer better.  3 1/2 stars",1472774400,,1424,4.612648221343873

5457610,2,B00AMXSFRK,"For the price, not bad....(note,I am only commenting on the feature presentation, Storm of the Century)

But, if we judge the mini-series against some of the other efforts that have been released, it comes across as a 3 of 5 stars result. One star is removed because of the awful compression defects in the picture quality.

The show is well acted. The atmosphere is good overall. But what kills this movie for me is that people act in ways that no one would act. For example, in one part there is someone running down the street stumbling and screaming for help. This person is one of the town's firefighters. Now, I don't know about you, but a grown man screaming would bring some concern from the townsfolk...don't you think? Instead, all the townspeople laugh at him. The viewer is like...HUH??? The people are like, ""hey steve! Is there a fire? HAR HAR HAR!"". The viewer instantly pops out of the immersion.
This sort of thing repeats over and over through the movie.
Outside of that, it is not bad....
But, I remember watching Salem's Lot (the original TV one, not the later version) and you just became a townsfolk. You never fell out of character. For me, that was a high water mark for TV movies.",1460851200,,1205,4.574074074074074
5457611,4,B00AMXSFRK,"Great screenplay and well done for a made for TV film.

5457631,4,B00AMXSFRK,"Intelligent Stephen King mini-series.

A stranger comes to a small Maine island town during the titular storm, and turns the town upside-down, starting by killing a sweet old lady in the very first scene.

Played with wonderfully charismatic and subtle menace by Colm Feore, this supernatural stranger, who knows everyone's secrets and can
manipulate others to do in themselves or loved ones, has one repeated message; 'Give me what I want and I'll go away'.

Of course, we don't find out what that something is until the end of the third and last part of the series, but it is a surprising and
effectively unsettling twist that leads to moral complexities and human emotion more than to simplistic horror.

There are flaws. Tim Daly as the protagonist (the town's constable) tries hard, but the character is bland enough that he can't quite keep up our interest the way antagonist Ferore can.

Also, for a 4 hour and 15 minute film, we get to know frustratingly little about many of the supporting characters. While well acted, we often are given a first impression of a character, and then really never learn much else. This keeps the film from becoming truly great when the climax involves the townspeople turning on themselves.

There's also the slightly annoying logic question. If Feore's character is so powerful, why can't he just take what he wants? (There's an explanation, but it's pretty thin).

None-the-less, I was almost never bored, and the film is very well made. Not quite a classic, but very much worth a look.",1449273600,12,1529,4.857692307692307

5457656,1,B00AMXSFRK,"I can think of absolutely nothing good to say about this disc. I hardly know where to begin with my criticisms. So First,the main event:""Storm Of The Century"" is a Great movie,unfortunately ECHO BRIDGE HOME ENTERTAINMENT saw fit to CRAM a 257 min.movie (the DVD case says 266 mins. IMdB says 257 mins.) onto a standard DVD disc resulting in an overly compressed fuzzy video. Then to add insult to injury,they CRAMMED 2 more movies,each 84 mins.long,each a B minus movie(IMO i'm being generous giving them a B- rating) which i don't believe anybody would ever buy for themselves as 'stand-alone' movies,onto the same disc,which of course resulted in even poorer PQ for all 3 movies. The 2 ""bonus"" movies look like Bad VHS transfers. One of the movies,""The Shadows"" has such a whacky aspect ratio that only a postage stamp AR could make people and objects look normal. Other AR's i tried made people/objects look fat/wide to varying degrees. I would return this disc except i can't find a copy of ""The Storm Of The Century"" as a single movie on one duel layer,or even a double sided DVD disc. IMO Any movie with a running time of 257 mins.*should be*on a DL disc,yet ECHO BRIDGE has the temerity to CRAM 434 mins.total onto one standard DVD disc,utterly masacring the PQ.
Then there's another insult to those of us who bought this disc. The movie should have been put on the disc as one continuous movie from beginning to end...but Noooo...ECHO BRIDGE gave us the movie in 3 parts which means that at the end of parts 1 and 2 you get kicked back to the main menu,then have to choose to go on to the next part. We shouldn't have to do that despite it originally being a 3 part mini-series. It wasn't necessary to do that.
This is my honest opinion of the disc. Others will disagree...YMMV
I'd would Much prefer a blu-ray release of ""The Storm Of The Century""as one Continuous  movie from beginning to end on a BD disc. Unfortunately there is no such animal...yet,but if there ever is a BD release of ""The Storm Of The Century"",i'll be more than happy to ditch this disc and buy the BD release.",1438387200,12,2090,4.558510638297872
5457657,5,B00AMXSFRK,"So many of Stephen King's books do not translate very well into movies. At best, they resemble B movies. Three of King's books that have been the exception when filmed are, Salem's Lot, Needful Things and The Storm Of The Century, Why were these great? Because the books were made into miniseries. Miniseries have long running times which give the story line and character profiles time to develop and deepen. Plus I love them because they are commercial free",1438300800,2,459,4.822784810126582

5457704,4,B00AMXSFRK,"but you won't be able to forget him. I recently watched an old episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit that starred Colm Feore as a ""ripped from the headlines"" character based on sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. Feore's chillingly understated performance reminded me of his earlier turn as the mysteriously evil Andre Linoge in this Stephen King miniseries. I wouldn't claim anything written by King is art for the ages, but I thought I remembered Feore's presence as riveting. So I had to get my hands on the DVD to verify that he really was as good as I'd thought. And he was. I couldn't tear my eyes off of him. The story's pretty good if too drawn-out in parts, diluting the suspense factor, but Feore's the reason to watch it. He was born to play that role.",1423008000,22,767,4.525179856115108

5457721,4,B00AMXSFRK,"This is more than just the 'Storm of the Century' mini-series, the two-disc set also includes seven other films. The other movies range in age and quality - from George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' to 'Zombie Dearest'. All are good enough for a late night zombie marathon. The eight videos are on two DVDs, five on one disc and three on the other (SofC mini-series being one of the three). So the videos are a bit compressed, but still watchable (my main reason for the four stars). I like these sort of flicks, even the more cheesy ones - so this was a good value for me.",1414108800,2,579,4.321100917431193
