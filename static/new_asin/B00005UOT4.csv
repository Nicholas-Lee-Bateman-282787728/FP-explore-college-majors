7954938,5,B00005UOT4,I love the video. Don't even remember buying it. I have no idea where it is at.,1473120000,,79,3.7058823529411766
7954939,5,B00005UOT4,although this video is from 1994 it is still the best one I have seen.  Michael Wallace narates.  Good footage of all of route 66.  I liked the footage of the Chain of Rocks Bridge showing the bridge before they converted it to a bicycle/walking trail.  Michael also visits with Lillian Redman owner of the Blue Swallow along with Angel Delgadillo...the Seligman barber who is very much responsible for keeping Route 66 alive.  90 minutes long.  Any fan of route 66 will enjoy this video,1048291200,,487,4.670588235294118
