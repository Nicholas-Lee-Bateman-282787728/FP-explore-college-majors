February 1, 1942 the Nazis changed their naval enigma coders to four rotor units making Allied U Boat intercepts impossible.  This DVD provides new investigative reporting that reveals the role of the James Bond creator, Sir Ian Fleming, played in one of the greatest failed INTELL operations to obtain the new four rotor machines.",1379203200,13,509,4.839080459770115

Much more could have been done with such a rich trove of data available on this key lesson on how not to launch an invasion. Forty-five minutes of my life that I will never recover.

5773312,5,B00D3XM7H0,"Well done with new information regarding the Dieppe raid. Nice interviews with veterans. The ""drama"" so often seen in documentary's such as this was not as prevalent as in other films of this genre. For some reason filmakers believe viewers need added suspense & drama which I find insulting & a waste of footage. The review after each "" commercial break"" is also a waste of time & footage. I for one abhor documentaries being turned into ""reality"" TV. This film fortunately did not stray down that path as much as orher films.

5773318,5,B00D3XM7H0,"This excellent documentary proves that there really WAS a sound reason behind the disastrous Dieppe raid of 1942. during the fierce battle of August 19th a special commando unit created by no other than Ian Fleming himself (the author of the fictious James Bond) targeted the secret codes and ciphers of the Enigma machine that were to be found in the German naval headquarters of the Hotel Moderne in downtown Dieppe. The unit was to take advantage of the confusion of the general assault and slip into the Dieppe port aboard the ship ""Locust"", but everything went terribly wrong due to the unexpected hard German resistance. So, Fleming who was waiting a few miles off the Dieppe beach on a British destroyer, returned to England empty-handed and the Allies lost a chance to save many lives by deciphering the 4-rotor Enigma machines six months earlier than they did. Military historian O'Keefe interviewed many survivors of the a Dieppe raid and the were astonished and moved to tears when they were informed about his top secret findings.

Using close-up shots of top secret documents, close-ups of their phrases or of words brought to magnification, establishes legitimacy of the assertions. Voice over narrative conveys information. An interview-like style feature the historian who is principal to the film. Descriptions of his step by step process of investigation with accompanying epiphanies portrays an arrival of a credible factual conclusion. To watch this film for an hours worth of entertainment would be unadvised. Unless a film about an investigative process is thought intriguing.

5773360,5,B00D3XM7H0,"There are many celebrations about D-Day at Normandy.  Before D-Day, there were special operations which included commando raids and  amphibious raids.  In the Nazi Kriegsmarine Submarine Fleet, the use of the infamous Enigma machine with its secret codes were well known.  There is truth about the first amphibious attack on mainland Europe in the small French port of Dieppe.
However, during the amphibious attack, this was a diversion to the clandestine commando raid by the British military to obtain the
latest version of the Enigma machine used in Submarine Warfare because of additions to the secret code.  Sir Ian Fleming, who was the famous author of the James Bond 007 books and movies was an actual participant in the commando operations!  Also, the commentaries and interviews reveal, during the re-enactments of events, reveal the motive of the Allies to secure the enigma machine were anticipated Nazi Submarine attacks regarding D-Day.  To achieve a full understanding of Dieppe, It is essential to view the entire contents of this DVD.  The true story of Dieppe, revealed after 70 years, is a sobering reminder of how close the
Allies came to loosing World War II, had some of Hitler's strategies succeeded!",1401840000,,1222,5.136363636363637
5773361,5,B00D3XM7H0,"This story of the Battle of Dieppe is a gripping description of what is described as the real reason for the limited attack on the port city.  Watching the film, the reason given in the story makes perfect sense and gives a better justification to the raid than the official line of testing amphibious techniques.  One could have tested the ability to assault the coast almost anywhere along the coast of Devon and Dorset.

The story now presented makes the losses of men justified as the returns from the raid helped the war effort immensely.  It is unfortunate that the British government didn`t tell the truth about the raid once the need for secrecy was over in 1945.  For the familiies of the men who died in the raid, this presentation is much too late although it might be of somebenefit to thier descendents.

I highly recommend this production to those interested in the Second World War and the unusualy efforts that were required to bring it to a successful conclusion.",1401494400,,980,4.701754385964913

This was the best price we could find as well as the Amazon Prime quick 2 day shipping.",1401062400,,264,3.8703703703703702
5773363,4,B00D3XM7H0,"This production gave a dimension to the account of Dieppe I never knew existed.  Based on the work of historian David O'Keefe, this presentation gives a side to the engagement that makes sense of the daring endeavor.  Though knowledgeable of WWII history, the account of Dieppe was one to which I had given almost no attention.  I knew of it as a failed invasion attempt about two years before that of Normandy.  I had no idea that it was not an invasion, but rather a raid.
The program begins with what we could call the original perception of the encounter, but quickly moves to reveal facts about it that had been buried in archives for decades.  O'Keefe discovered, deep within previously classified documents, that the campaign was intended to obtain intelligence that would help the Allied forces against Nazi Germany.
This production was created for presentation on television, with regular ""commercial breaks"".  For that reason, there is frequent rehash of material when returning from each of those breaks.  As each segment unfolds, the viewer is given new information, and the plot builds.  It is not until well into the program that one learns of the actual objective of this encounter.
I would recommend this program, and especially to those with an interest in WWII and the history of conflict in general.  I had rented it for a short time, so I watched it through twice, and found it even more engaging the second time than the first.  Despite the rehash, as mentioned earlier, the story does not drag or become monotonous.  Some of the images are harrowing, and thus it would not be recommended for viewing by younger persons or those sensitive to the violence of war.",1400889600,,1683,4.829268292682927

5773365,3,B00D3XM7H0,"It is almost always a good thing when Canada decides to acknowledge the achievements of their military by contributing to the field of historical documentary. Despite the countrys tendency to be less vocal about their accomplishments, it is proven fact that Canadas military is one of the worlds best.

The Dieppe Raid of August 19, 1942, is considered by most historians (and certainly by the survivors who were there) to have been a massive failure. It is no reflection on Canadas military that they lost the day; what is extraordinary is that they were there at all.

One survivor of the raid who recently passed away in Winnipeg, Manitoba (he was a member of The Queens Own Highlanders of Canada, a Winnipeg regiment) told a friend of this reviewer that being at Dieppe was like standing in the middle of a football field and being shot at by the enemy in the stands.

The point of this new documentary is that historian/presenter David OKeefe believes he has cracked the mystery as to why the raid took place to begin with.

At a time when the Allies were in no position to sustain an invasion of Europe and when the Russians were being pounded on the eastern front, something had to be done to test the waters, so to speak. Would a hit and run raid scare the Nazis? Would it deflect some attention away from attacking the Soviets? Would it provide an opportunity to learn some valuable lessons before the actual invasion of EuropeD-Day as it came to be knownsome years later?

Perhaps all of these things are true. It was apparently not uncommon for operations to have more than one objective. What is intriguing to consider is the hypothesis put forward by David OKeefe, that the raid was also designedperhaps even primarily soto pinch (steal) a German 4 wheel Enigma machine, which was used to transmit and receive a secret code the Allies had been unable to break.

While some may disagree with this theory, it is intriguing to consider. The fact it was spearheaded by Commander Ian Fleming, who went on to create the worlds most famous spy, James Bond, is even more seductive.

The presentation style of this film is a little off-putting in that the lightning fast editing and mixture of special effects and re-enactments layered over (the much more interesting) actual archival footage seems designed for the MTV-age viewer. For my money, there is nothing more powerful than seeing real footage of the Canadian dead, so meticulously documented by German cameramen after the battle. Be that as it may, the story of the Dieppe Raid is potent stuff.

But perhaps the final verdict on this well-meaning documentary must be given by the survivors who have lived with the haunting question why undertake such a hopeless endeavour to begin with? As Professor OKeefe shows his evidence to one Dieppe veteran on camera the man is moved to tears as finally, after all these years, the life-altering experience he endured makes some kind of sense.

Ours is not to reason why; ours is but to do or die.

Perhaps, but knowledge is a powerful panacea.",1397433600,3,3048,4.755681818181818

I can certainly understand why Britain wanted the intelligence data at the port.  Churchill said that in war, truth must be concealed within a bodyguard of lies.

5773377,3,B00D3XM7H0,"With time and access to once classified information, the history of WWII continues to be revised. New theories and assumptions aren't always accurate. This docudrama has chosen to review only one facet of the Dieppe Raid. Was the only intent of this operation to secure (""pinch"") a four rotor Enigma machine and the associated code books? Possibly.

One of the originally stated purposes of this raid was to acquire more information about the German radar stations and that was accomplished. The importance of radar jamming technology was a definite positive. The military intelligence information provided by recommence flights and other sources was inaccurate at best and proved to be disastrous for both Canadian and British troops. This is a well documented fact.

The narration would appear to be repetitive because the commercials have been deleted. The reenactments are punctuated with unnecessary 'light blasts' that seem to have no other purpose than to add to the length of production time. There is some original footage but not any that pertains to the Dieppe Raid. The interviews do add a personal dimension. Recommended viewing? The information presented is already available via multiple sources and this presentation only offers a 'dramatic' format. Worth viewing if you enjoy this type video or if you are just curious. Serious students of WWII military history may find it interesting or  choose to find the faults. One can always find fun in a 'mystery drama!'

5773379,2,B00D3XM7H0,Not what I expected; after enduring 15 minutes of document drama I thought it would at least be a good history documentary and I was wrong.  It was terrible and thank god most of the people involved are dead and they didn't have to be witness to the bs said in the movie.  Just my opinion.,1384128000,,289,4.142857142857143

5773381,5,B00D3XM7H0,"I have followed our war history for all wars. 1st World War because my three great, great Uncles were gassed while fighting the 1st world war and of course received no compensation. They suffered terribly and were unable to work. My great grandfather who lost an arm, still worked with one arm and other friends and relatives did what they could to support them till they finally died. 2nd World War because my older brother was drafter when he reached 18, lucky for him, he came home unharmed. At that time they changed the law and allowed all returning Vets to pay for their college degree and that how he received it. As soon as the over wars began he just became a regular and stayed in Air Force till his death at age 80,

The Canadians screwed the men who went to war for them. Shameful what this and other countries have allowed to happened to our service men. Bet you're sorry you asked me for this one. Got more than you expected.",1381795200,2,939,4.396551724137931
5773382,5,B00D3XM7H0,"I want to say, that as a lay historian, I had no idea, of the depth of secrecy that the Dieppe raid in August 1942 had. My late Father, was on the other side of the world, fighting Japan. This story, told in a lot of re-enactments, is very exciting to me. I did not know, that a future best selling author, was deeply involved. It was a real surprise to me. A very good and accurate account, as well as a very entertaining account.

5773384,5,B00D3XM7H0,"I seriously doubt if you could find more than one person in a hundred on the street that could describe the Dieppe raid and the reason that it occurred.  Even being a big military history buff myself, I basically just knew it was a fairly large raid (about 5,000 men) that was somehow practice for D-Day down the road, and that it caused horrible casualties for the Canadians that participated.  But finally after 70 years the top secret documents related to this operation have been released, and the info contained in those documents will amaze you!  Every student of WW2 should see this!",1380585600,17,590,4.70873786407767

8589313,4,B00D3XM7H0,"An interesting, and possibly true, scenario as to why the ill-conceived and poorly executed raid on Dieppe was launched.  Ostensibly the reason was to capture a newly deployed 4 rotor Enigma machine, which was replacing the prior 3  rotor models.  Bletchley Park analysts had succeeded in decoding Wehrmacht ciphers using the 3 rotor machine, which the Germans never learned about during the war.  But the upgrade was to ensure more cipher security anyway.  Dieppe, on the coast of France, at the time of the raid was HQ for the Kriegsmarine, as such it was well-guarded.  The most often reason by WW2 historians was that Dieppe was to be a practice run for the subsequent DDay invasion.  This trial was to be a teaching event for Allied High Command to help plan for the main invasion.  The film's author provides a lot of evidence to support his these, including original research in French, German, and British naval archives.  The story is plausible but two theories are present to contradict the author's assumptions.  One theory is that Bletchley Park was already working on a 4 rotor solution at the time of the raid, though had not completed the task.  So if the cryptologists were that close to solution, why undertake such great peril in men and materiel for something which would render a code-breaking invasion obsolete?  A second reason, certainly one which does not preclude the author's theory, is the overwhelming opinion of historians that the ""practice invasion"" was the true reason.  I have attended lectures and seen videos on Dieppe but this theory has never been mentioned once.
For those of us who are not historians, this movie gives reason to question the official story.  However, not being a research historian makes it difficult to know that Tyler Smith's thesis is correct.  One plus of this movie is that we get detailed aspects of the actual raid itself, how succeeded and more often how it failed.",1481241600,2,1929,4.892307692307693
