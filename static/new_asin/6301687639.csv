7814696,5,6301687639,"In ""America Screams,"" we get to ride roller coasters with the grand master of terror himself, Vincent Price, and his infectious humor, a perfect fit for the subject, is one of his best performances.  This documentary, the first of its kind, was shot in 1978, so while it may not be up-to-date as far as the wild rides we have today, its history is superb, which includes early 1900s footage of the first roller coasters and rides at the infamous Coney Island.  Also included is an interview with the venerable wooden coaster designer John Allen, a tour through the Arrow Development Company, which created the first log flumes and corkscrew coasters, and a step-by-step viewing of the construction of Magic Mountain's original Colossus.  This is a must-have for roller coaster and amusement park fans.",1500076800,,801,4.962686567164179
7814697,5,6301687639,This tape deserves a high rating because it discusses the history of roller coasters from the beginning to the 1970's.,1384646400,,118,4.95
7814698,5,6301687639,"I am not going to put my VHS of Vincent Price's roller coaster special onto DVD to make money.  I have two certifiable
Vincent Price ""krazibots"" who will blither all over me if I make them a DVD of this for their birthday or Christmas gift.",1370649600,,240,4.217391304347826
7814699,5,6301687639,"This Vincent Price video is a classic.  It gives the history of amusement and theme parks.  It discusses some of the engineering of roller coasters.  It shows some early footage of flat rides, but it goes into great depth on roller coasters.  Great for watching.  Excellent as part of the pre-trip preparation for Amusement Park Physics Days.",1327881600,2,342,4.9298245614035086
7814700,5,6301687639,"I guess I should because this is a review.  Okay, this isn't the most devastatingly in depth roller coaster documentary. In fact, I purchased it only because one of my best friends watched it as a small child.  It was a gift.  A shocking one, at that.  He thinks I am a much better friend than I probably am for remembering he talked about this. But, I can never forget his impersonation (and once I saw it, it was dead on) of Vincent Price say ""rolly coaster"" whilst riding a rolly coaster.  It's amazing.  It's up there with Liberace's coats and Willam Defoe's teeth.  It's incredible.  Don't believe me?  What do I care.  I already have a way to view it whenever I want.  You, however, are just missing out.  Don't let the Matt Dillon roller coaster documentary (ish) movie sway you away.  This one is by far better.  And it is by far shorter!  It's Vincent Price, People!  The reason we all like Thriller!  Purchase it.  For the people who would sell such gold do not deserve to have it in their hands.",1302998400,3,1006,4.375
7814701,4,6301687639,"I taped this from television when I was nine years old and must have watched it a thousand times afterwards.  Vincent Price gives a great history of rollercoasters starting with La Marcus Thomson and Coney Island to modern day (late 70's) rides.  Includes construction footage of Colossus at Magic Mountain, video of Arrow's suspended prototype, an interview with Karl Bacon of Arrow, plus lots of ride footage of coasters  from around the country.",1053302400,8,448,5.109589041095891
