6964661,5,B00S8M03ZY,"This film throws the reader into the world of Marieme, a later-teen girl who's parting from her family and finding a new, rambunctious, fun and shoplifting gaggle of friends. She stands her ground. She gives way. She laughs and cries (but rarely the later) and the film is intelligently made.

Every bit of dialogue in the film is believable, and every scene is natural. This is kind of the baseline for every film I would like to see, where that's concerned. And there is so much that makes the characters real, that I cannot begin to unravel the reasons for you; for every time you want Marieme to succeed, live and love, there's an unknown twist that's utterly believable. Prepare for life, before watching this. And still, it's anything but boring, and life in a poor suburb of Paris unfurls to us all. This is a Gift.

I love Cline Sciamma, the director, and this is just another step in a great way for a true film. Go see, and love it.",1423353600,19,942,4.47093023255814

6964663,4,B00S8M03ZY,"Where THE FALLING failed to engage me on an emotional level, GIRLHOOD provided that in spades. It tells the story of Marieme (Karidja Toure), a young girl on the cusp of becoming a woman. Like pretty much every person, she wants to find a place in the world and be happy, and the film is basically an exploration of how she tries to achieve those goals. The major thing standing in the way, one of the cold truths about how the real world works, is that not only is she a female, but a minority female as well. She goes through all of the usual difficulties in addition to ones unique to people of color. For instance, because of her low grades in junior high (or at least the French equivalent), an unseen school counselor suggests that she go to vocational school instead of moving on to lycee (high school), which Marieme rejects. Her path to self-realization is an arduous and emotionally difficult one in which she encounters sexism and abuse, but still manages to soldier on. Her story is the story of many young women and, for that reason, it should resonate with many people regardless of cultural boundaries. From a technical perspective, the production values were impeccable and all of the performances were perfect, with a degree of authenticity I haven't seen in a while. Every bit of dialogue felt realistic, and the actors were even able to convey a lot through equally deft physical performances. I also quite liked the score and soundtrack. The only reservation I have is that the narrative is a bit unbalanced in how much time it devotes to each phase of Marieme's ""becoming,"" but this is otherwise a phenomenal effort from all involved. For whatever reason, this got no love from the Academy, but GIRLHOOD is definitely worth your time.",1453593600,4,1755,4.701298701298701

6964669,5,B00S8M03ZY,"This film was incredible. Absolutely beautiful with really unique and elegant use of music. It asks questions about class, gender, what it means to be beautiful, what it means to be independent, and creates a main character you'll root for despite the many ""bad"" choices she makes. It is a gorgeous portrayal of female friendship which is so rare to see in film. I 100% recommend this movie.

6964670,5,B00S8M03ZY,"This beautifully shot film is a study of the pressures and obstacles of immigrant girls in the Paris suburbs. Marieme (who changes her name to Vic) attempts to escape her fate by refusing to adopt traditional gender roles. Those decisions are at once liberating and problematic as she becomes successful, but increasing reliant criminal gangs. The strange opening scene of immigrant teenage girls playing American football stayed with me. I saw it as representing a world of potential where a person can be who they decide to be. But, quickly the girls are silenced by the young men who rule the night back in their apartment complex. Well worth the time.  In French.",1430352000,10,667,4.902654867256637

8697694,3,B00S8M03ZY,"This French film (""Bande de Filles"") actually translates to Gang of Girls.  Perhaps American distributors were cashing in on the award winning Boyhood with the rebranding.  In any case, the film is directed and written by Celine Sciamma (Tomboy) with a careful eye capturing the maturity of a 16 year old French schoolgirl.

Karidja Toure is very good as Marieme who later adopts the nickname Vic.  She lives with her mother who constantly works (and sees little screen time), her older brother, who has taken on the role as a father-like disciplinarian and 2 younger sisters.  Marieme is a shy girl who lacks confidence and is about to booted out of school.  Marieme wants to go to high school like the other girls, but her academics have resulting in her being held back in middle school twice.  Her counsellor wants her to go to vocational school but she wants none of it.

Marieme is approached by 3 slightly older girls led by Lady (Assa Sylla), along with Fily (Marietou Toure) and Bebe (Simina Soumare).  The girls have their own little mini-gang and just lost a member to motherhood.  Marieme is invited in and surprisingly finds fun for the first time.  One of the highlights of the film is the quartet dancing and lip-synching to Rhiannas Diamonds.  Now known as Vic, Marieme struggles with a romantic interest in one of her brothers friends, while coping with her sometimes violent brother.  At the same time, she assumes responsibility for her younger sisters.  A lot to handle for a 16 year old.

While the film has some nice elements, it often devolves into soap-opera like scenes where the camera lingers too long on the faces of the characters.  While Marieme/Vic explores her options for the future including a stint as a drug delivery girl, were left with a longing to know where shes going.  There is also some confusing elements suggesting Vic may be exploring her own sexuality.  In one scene her boyfriend questions why she has her breasts wrapped in a tight gauze.  Me too.  While the overly long film is certainly watchable, the universal critical accolades eludes me.",1464393600,2,2092,4.80672268907563

Such a jumping off point for discussion, formal writing and further investigation.  I cannot recommend it more highly.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

French director Cline Sciamma's new film is called ""Girlhood,"" probably named that way in English to capitalize on last year's similar moniker, ""Boyhood."" But in French, it's translated as ""Girl Gang,"" which to my ears is a more appropriate title.

Citing the lack of French films dealing with black people, Sciamma, who is white, decided to hang out with some black French-African teenagers to learn more about their culture and perhaps fashion a film based on her experiences. The resulting product features non-professional actors culled from what is usually referred to in the US as ""the projects,"" rows of drab apartment buildings in a lower socio-economic section of the city.

The opening scene is most telling as Sciamma depicts a group of high school girls playing American style football. As they walk home and continually pass by groups of loud, hostile-acting males, they gradually peel off, finally leaving us with the film's protagonist, Marieme, a 16 year old teenager who later refers to herself as ""Vic"" (for Victory).

Marieme's mother is too busy working to pay much attention to the teenager's needs and her brother is a macho creep who occasionally physically abuses her. After she fails to get into college because of poor grades (and faced with the prospect of attending a vocational school instead), Marieme develops a crush on a boy who is friends with a gang of three girlsshe soon falls in with the group and gradually is transformed from a shy teenager to an aggressive rebel.

The leader of the three is Lady, whom the other girls look up to. Sciamma chronicles the misadventures of the girl gang as they traipse around Paris (mainly in shopping malls), shoplifting, extorting money from other girls and acting as obnoxiously as they can. Sciamma appears to take no stand on their behavior, merely depicting their loutish shenanigans as typical of wayward, rebellious teenagers.

The main plot involves Lady's fall from grace after she is beaten up in a fight with a girl from a rival gang before a fairly large group of people. Lady retreats from public review after her father forbids her to pursue further rebelliousness activities. Marieme takes up the group's mantle when she in turn beats up the teenager who defeated Lady.

Sciamma's gritty depiction of the activities of the girl gang and their rivals works well--akin to some of the more interesting cinema verit efforts here in the US. Not only does she capture their anti-social side with cogent verisimilitude but also highlights the teenagers' sense of camaraderie (the highlight being the group dancing to Rihanna's song ""Diamaonds"").

Unfortunately, Sciamma's resolution to Marieme's story is not completely satisfactory. Marieme eventually parts with the rest of her group and begins working for a local drug dealer, Abou. At one point we see her disguising herself as a boy, perhaps to avoid being hit upon by rapacious males who are part of Abou's group. Later, Abou does just that at a party and Marieme declares she's through working for him. Marieme's boyfriend's suggestion that they get married falls on deaf ears and the aimless former gang leader is rebuffed after she tries to buzz herself into the family apartment.

What are we supposed to conclude about Marieme's fate? Is she the victim of a society that favors the upper middle-class and the rich? Is it all racialthat because she's black, she can't get ahead? Or is it Marieme's own choices that stymie her? Perhaps she could have gone to vocational school instead of falling in with her girl gang rebels. Sciamma again perhaps takes no sides but her tale feels incomplete perhaps we'll have to wait for the sequel to find out what happened to her.",1455926400,2,3775,4.9683042789223455
