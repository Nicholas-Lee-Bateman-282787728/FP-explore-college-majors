5049219,5,B00720OO0S,"Jerusalem Countdown is one of the most intense, realistic, suspenseful, believable end times thrillers that I've ever seen -- I might even put it at the top of the list. I could feel my own heartbeat growing stronger by the end of this film. Be aware -- you're not going to see this one on the Hallmark Channel.

5049220,1,B00720OO0S,"The plot was good and feasible until the introduction of the Protestants faulty interpretation of the Bible and their belief in the nonexistent ""rapture."" But then again Martin Luther was a heretic. Still, the premise of the film is based on passages from Isaiah, which has NOTHING to do with any 'rapture'. So the premise based on Isaiah was good, but then the film collapsed. I would not recommend this film.",1508716800,2,410,4.788732394366197

The special effects were second to none compared with any secular film i've seen; and yet, it's evangelical and perfect for movie nights!  I also like that the supporting actors were as believable as the main.  I'd give it five if there was more attention paid to certain details to make the story more believable (e.g., FBI discussing extremely sensitive matters in a public library, cooperative 911 dispatcher, etc.)",1439510400,,558,5.032608695652174

5049275,3,B00720OO0S,"Jerusalem Countdown was okay. It starts with the ""rapture"" then goes back seven days (or something) and concludes where you begin -- with the ""rapture."" However, somehow it is a let down. All of us watching the movie were expecting more to happen AFTER the rapture sequence. Instead, the movie just sort of ended. From what we understand, there is no sequel either. The movie ends with the feel that there should be a sequel.

Acting was just okay and there seemed to be a few plot holes that should have been caught and filled by writers/editors before the final cut of the film.

The film was okay, but not exceptional.",1436745600,2,621,4.585585585585585

Luckily for me I was right. Personally I didn't feel this film was overly preachy, and the message was there, albeit not in the way most of the reviewers expected. There was a scene or two with some stilted awkward lines, but there was no obscenity, and a bit of action and suspense. The ending went a bit different than I expected, and seems to leave room for some follow-on films. I don't see how any reviewers could have missed the ""you don't know what you're in for"" line AND the Rapture event at the end; or maybe they just didn't understand the significance.

It starts off showing the apocalypse happening, then goes back to the mystery of how it all begun. Yet it shows terrorists under religious obligations are ready to bomb up a location until detectives get some insight to stop them in time. It reminds you of the TV series: 24. It has action, mystery, and suspense with some brief life experiences to bring a person to Christ but the plot is a bit confusing.

We read it in the Bible (what is to be expected) and are not afraid as we (as the Church) will be with the Lord when this all takes place. The point I am trying to make is that John Hagee's book is vividly put to life on this film. Sure, it has been dressed up to some extent ""Hollywood"" style, but the thrust of the movie is the message.

Anyone watching this film who is NOT a Christian may and most probably scoff at its viewing. But the film's message is to eventually get down deep into the souls of the non-believer's heart. That sometime later in time he or she will reflect upon the message and inquire more about it. They will have questions. The best way for these people to get answers is to go to John Hagee's web site. I believe it is HGM.com, but if that is not it, all you have to do is to just google John Hagee and one can navigate from there quite easily.",1391644800,,940,4.164835164835165

I think I would have just been satisfied to watch the trailer about 10 times in a row.  It's really wordy, lots of dialog, probably because of a low budget.  They did try really hard on this one but David A.R. White is just not believable as an action guy in anything he does.  Kinda neat to see the Six Million Dollar Man grace the screen again though.

5049357,4,B00720OO0S,"I am a fan of end time stories in books and movies and have read extensively in the genre. Most importantly I am also a student of the Bible and have a special interest in end time's studies from the Bible's perspective. Based on my observations of world events and the Biblical accounts of the world situation in the end times I am convinced we are living in those times.

This is clearly a Christian film and will repel those who reject the Christian message; it is interesting to note the vitriolic nature of some of the reviews that have been written elsewhere about this movie. It is evident that the verbal antagonism being expressed goes far beyond the movie directly to the concepts of God, man, the end of the world and judgment.

Only the Lord knows how much time we have left but I, for one, think the closing event in the movie is right upon us. There are really no surprises in the movie as it deals with things that have been discussed extensively over a long period of time. What the movie does, however, is to put the viewer in the middle of the action as the closing events of human history begin to unfold. The author of the book by the same name, John Hagee, is very knowledgeable on the subject and gets the facts laid out in a manner consistent with the Biblical account.

I believe there is some artistic license in the closing scene but not so much as to compromise the message intended. This is a reasonably satisfying film which may help awaken some to what is on the horizon.",1351296000,15,1501,4.392086330935252

I hope I can find more movies like this & I'm really hoping there is a sequel to this movie.",1350000000,,440,4.190476190476191

5049360,4,B00720OO0S,"This movie was exactly what I was expecting.  It was packed with action, not typical for Bible based movies, and portrayed the imminence of the rapture well.  I appreciate that it also showed those who recognize their need for a savior, and that Christ's redemptive plan is the only way of salvation.  This is the kind of movie that could be shown in a theater and people could easily understand the gospel.  It would also draw a variety of people.  The story line just had a couple of places where it could have transitioned to the next a scene a little better, but overall it was a great production.",1347235200,,601,4.477064220183486

My problem is that it seems to be striving to follow in the same vein of the Bourne movies (but not as good)--fast-paced, no-explanations plot mixed with a kinectic pace of action...leaving the viewer wondering what the heck just happened and why.

But I still liked it and will probably see it again.",1346025600,,489,4.729411764705882
5049362,1,B00720OO0S,"Several close ups of a Bible and several ""discussions"" between two female believers and two male skeptics (they eventually see the light) is the first indicator of being talked down to (preached to) both literally and figuratively. Then you have as the usual bad guys -  communist like Russia and non-Christian Islamic Iran. Then you have the symbolic ultimate apocalyptic nuclear war head as the evil people's tool (no mention that only Christian USA has ever used it on people) and interpreted by some through Bible prophecy as God's final wrath. The bottom line is that the movie is a low intelligence hodgepodge of stereotypes and robotic, stand and stare and read short memorized lines, acting (what better representatives of this than Lee Majors and Randy Travis). Even the science and technical backstories were Hollywood fantasy and would fail a middle school science class exam.",1345852800,,887,5.117241379310345

5049364,3,B00720OO0S,"I rented this one from Red Box.  The story could have easily been a great movie.  As it turned out, it was an okay movie.  The production was low level and made a negative difference.  The actors probably would have looked a lot better if the director and producer had done a better job. The cutting and splicing was a little sloppy and the cuts that made it into the movie sometimes looked like they shouldn't have made it.  No matter how low your budget, a good director can make a masterpiece.  Here we have a movie that easily could have been a masterpiece but ended up being overshadowed by poor production decisions.  The Rapture seen towards the end was the best Rapture seen ever.  Too bad the rest of the movie didn't mimic that level of quality.  Still, it is worth seeing.",1345248000,13,783,4.419580419580419

5049366,1,B00720OO0S,"So, as my title suggests, and as the other reviews have already pointed out, the film labored through a series of unexplained, illogical, and disconnected scenes. Finally reaching the last one. The only one I really remember.

Honestly, I felt that the last moment in the movie was the best filmed and the most moving. The little things like the power line sparking and dying. Pretty cliche for apocalyptic movies, but there's a reason why they've become cliche -- they do work. I actually felt a little disappointed when the credits started rolling. Unlike the previous 84 minutes.

The other part was, as pointed out before, half FBI making stupid mistakes, and half forced and awkward preaching. Now, unlike some, I don't have a problem with preaching -- if it is done right. Non-Christian productions do it just as much -- think many Star Trek episodes, Star Wars, and almost all children's movies from the Lorax to Happy Feet preach.

What makes it work or not work is if the writers give a reason for it being there. Most of the time, the movie didn't even give us time to meet the characters before they started preaching to us, followed by more... preaching to us. We never do get to know them beyond what they think and believe .... how about a little of what they feel?

Finally -- doesn't anyone have internet in this future? Don't they know the Bible is online in a thousand translations?

And really? Directions for life = code = missile codes? All in a moment of brilliant clarity. In a dark library. In the age of the internet. Yeah.",1344470400,,1548,4.614545454545454

5049369,1,B00720OO0S,"We rented this movie recently because it had a lot of promise.  Suitcase bombs, government agents, Iran vs. Israel, domestic terrorism, CIA/FBI, etc.  Even a high-schooler on his first film project could make that at least somewhat interesting.  Right?  Wrong.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  No discernable plot, no character development, no hero to be found, abysmal knowledge of police/FBI procedures, loose ends that never got tied up, and an abrupt ending that ended nothing but the suspense of looking for some meaning in this movie. My son described it as not even worthy of the title ""cheeser"" (because it didn't even have enough cheese to quality.)  The most interesting elements of the movie (no exaggeration) all were in the trailer.  One of the best scenes, delivered by Stacey Keech and which helped tie the plot together, got cut!  The big name stars (Keech, Majors) made limited appearances and apparently were hired simply to lure people into watching this sloppy effort.  Don't be fooled by the cover picture.  Fact is, had the producers developed an actual plot (beyond the effort to show a conversion scene toward the end), had they demonstrated the slightest development of the central characters, their relationship, etc., had they had even the semblance of a hero or heroine, and had they spend even two hours watching your basic television cop show like NCIS, etc., they could have made a reasonably credible and enjoyable film.  Instead, this is packed to the gills with the unlikeliest police mistakes, FBI field agents carrying on and traveling the country without backup or local field office support, an impending nuclear terrorist attack without so much as senior director involvement (!), idiotic scenes like [SPOILER WARNING] when Jaci Valesquez' character and her partner fail to search an apartment after finding a freshly murdered body (and the bad guy kills the partner), or when they leave a spent hypodermic needle in a top-security interrogation room and the bad guy uses it (apparently) to escape, or when they handed off classified material in a cafe, or (my favorite) when they go to the local library after hours and solve the mystery with a Bible and a dictionary.  Seriously, it is movies like this that once made watching ""Christian"" films feel like being stoned to death with popcorn.  Don't waste your money.  Get October Baby, Facing the Giants, Flywheel, Fireproof, End of the Spear, Courageous, The Blind Side, etc.  You'll have plot and character development and something to enjoy, as well as some good lessons to take home.

This one featured great camera work, competent acting, and a decent story line. If you're a fan of bang-bang, shoot-em-up suspense thrillers, this will appeal to you. I'm more attracted to cerebral and spiritual films, but this one definitely kept my interest. David A.R. White was stellar. His romantic interest in the film was cute enough to satisfy most critics who require a lovely heroine to make their movie experience complete. I only gave this 4 stars because 5 stars represents a movie that you should not miss. I think most people will find this movie enjoyable, but it certainly does not bring a message that hasn't been told before. I like the direction Christian films are going. My desire though is to see more films dealing with sin and salvation than the sensational aspects of eschatology.

Great acting, a well written story and the excellent production value in this film as well as in the other films PureFlix offers gives me great hope of getting more decent movies that can compete with the big screen blockbusters.
And the rapture scene is amazing, I found myself watching that part over again several times.",1336521600,22,615,4.5
5049386,5,B00720OO0S,"Great Movie!  I feel everyone needs to see this one ASAP.  I've never heard so many people in my life time within the last six months say, ""He's Coming Soon"" so much!  The signs are everywhere. After watching this great movie I went to shut down my computer and before shuting down, all I seen was what this movie was telling us.  It's everywhere!  Our #1 goal in life should be making sure everyone around us knows our Father and is ready for this great event coming sooner than we think.  We should live each day like we're going Home any second because that's what will happen.  Please watch the movie and share this one.",1335830400,54,624,4.373913043478261
5049387,1,B00720OO0S,"David A.R. White plays an FBI agent who finds out that nuclear weapons have been smuggled into the US by terrorists who want to attack the US and Israel. Inspired by a Christian non-fiction book about Bible prophecy, ""Jerusalem Countdown"" is heavy on religion and often feels preachy, while it fails miserably when it comes to plotting and creating suspense. The result is a boring movie that doesn't even measure up to other faith based thrillers.  Not recommended.",1335052800,4,466,4.9743589743589745
5049388,5,B00720OO0S,"This is a story about end times, based on the book by the same name. Things get off to a very slow start, but there are some parts of the story that were so intense that I almost wanted to leave the room. I can't really compare it to other end-time movies, because I usually don't watch them, but this one appears to be pretty much the way the Bible describes it.",1334707200,50,363,4.055555555555555
