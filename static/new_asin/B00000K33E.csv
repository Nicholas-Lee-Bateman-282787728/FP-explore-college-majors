7914145,5,B00000K33E,"This VHS tape, Volume 4 is confusing because instead of following the order of the first 3 tapes which would be episode 7 from series 1 & episode 1 from series 2, it includes episodes 3 and 7 from series 2.  I recommend waiting for the 3 DVD set due out June 15th 2004!  The set is supposed to have all 13 episodes.  There is a Christmas special episode called ""Yuletide Spirit"" which make it 14 episodes so I hope that it's included in the set.  With three discs, there should be plenty of room. I don't see why they wouldn't all be there.  For more on the DVD release go to:

7914146,5,B00000K33E,Real love with misinterpretation takes its toll when Inspector Fowlers wedding-proposal approach to Pat gets out of hand. And the mistaken identity of a dog for a man puts Raymond on the edge. As do they hopefully tried to live unhappily ever after. Of course I was happy to watch the episode. Thus it would have been a true story my sympathies.,1013472000,,345,4.580645161290323
