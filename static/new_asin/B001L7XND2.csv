3681735,5,B001L7XND2,"Faced with headlines about Cuban prisoners starving themselves to death and the unsolved status of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, this movie about IRA prisoners in Northern Ireland begs many questions but provides few answers.  Are they criminals in a glorified gang? The British answer would be yes.  Are any of the resistance methods employed by the IRA effective? Who is being punished more by the no clothes no cleaning strike?

The questions of ethics and politics are neatly folded into the various characters of the cast.  Sands is clearly right to stand for status as a political prisoner.  The British jailer is clearly right to hate the 2-bit gangsters who drape Irish nationalism over their crimes.  The priest is right in loving the sinner but expressing serious doubts about the virtues of a hunger strike.  The nurses are right in caring for their patient and hating what he does as he slowly wastes away.

The acting carries this film and prevents it from being heavy-handed or preachy.  Each actor carries his point of view so confidently and completely that the viewer can't help but empathize with the horrific events that each actor confronts.

The film work is excellent.  Nothing too showy or gimicky: no one is trying to make a faux-documentary here.  The little details captured by camera particularly in the early scenes during the no wash strike a powerful and disturbing.  The body of sands as he detriorates is painfully vivid.

After it is finished, this film leaves the big questions open and will make viewers want to talk about some of the complexities brought out in the picture.  Ultimately, I think, the one question each character forces us to confront is:  how can  mankind be so cruel to each other and yet so oblivious to other's suffering at the same time?",1270425600,6,1790,4.874172185430464
3681736,5,B001L7XND2,"The world has been dominated by overbearing, greed fueled and power mad religions, armies and monarchies since the rise of humanoids. It goes on to this very day in it's many forms. Some are refined and cloaked in self-righteousness. Others through blunt force evil. The common denominator is always the same: The conquest and subsequent enslaving of the innocent. What inevitably follows is the systematic attempt to destroy those who speak out against the tyranny. Though voices are silenced, the spirit endures. It is a reality the barbarian can never grasp. For it has no soul.

One such voice came in the form of Bobby Sands. The story of 'Hunger' concerns him, but it would be a mistake to believe that he was it's sole bearer. He was a representative of a much larger effort to see a united Ireland join the world of independent and free countries. A cause that stretched from the footsteps of men, women and children to the prisoners of the the notorious H-Blocks.

I had read about the hunger strike in 1987. A book by the name of 'Skylark Sing Your Lonely Song' documented the path taken by it's author, Bobby Sands. Each page of that book was more difficult to turn than the last. It was painful, yet necessary to understand what happened, what series of events that led to the strike.

I had heard rumors of movies under consideration to portray the life and times of the prisoners in the Maze. Over the years, I lost track of what might eventually get made. So when I came across 'Hunger' on Netflix, I was hopeful. Remembering the book, I went into the screening just wanting to see an accurate portrayal. What I found was a matter of fact retelling of the hunger strike without fanfare, special effects or heroic sappy dialogue.

There is an extended, one shot scene that features Sands (Michael Fassbender) and a priest named Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham). The scene is brilliantly written and acted. The banter plods along, darts and sometimes dances until it gets to the heart of the matter. Clearly one of the finest moments in film that I have come across in some time.

The 'supplements' are filled with more on the story and the making of the film. We find out exactly who this 'Steve McQueen' is, hear from the actors and are treated to a BBC piece on the Hunger Strike that was never shown in the United States. I highly recommend these extras.

'Hunger' was crafted in sparse, stark tones by director, Steve McQueen. It is an intense, and direct portrait of a dynamic event that unfolded in the early 1980's. In many ways, it was one of the last powerful protest movements that the world would witness after decades of causes borne of action, not lip service. What had been won will be debated for centuries to come. What was lost, forever mourned by the descendants of freedom.",1269820800,3,2812,4.659274193548387
3681737,5,B001L7XND2,"This is an amazing and brutal movie. It is an ongoing effort over the last few years to show the suffering that has occurred in the North of Ireland. Of course, being part of the Criterion Collection assures top quality with even a detailed booklet included. If you have any interest in ""The Troubles"" (at least from the Nationalist side) you should see this one. Little pricey but worth the dollars.",1269302400,3,400,4.647887323943662
3681738,5,B001L7XND2,"Hunger is a film with such power and beauty it's really difficult to convey the experience of watching it as to how impressive it really is.  The performance from Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands is daring and scary, as he literally had to diet until his body became that of a man on a hunger strike.  The added feature with director Steve McQueen brings incredible insight to the art and humanity behind the film.  Without question, a must-see film.",1268006400,3,451,4.6835443037974684
3681739,2,B001L7XND2,"I wasn't impressed with this movie.  It takes more than blood, feces, urine, and starvation to impress me.  In a nutshell, the makers of the movie used Bobby Sands and the hunger strike to make a brutal and disgusting movie that would receive its high marks on shock value alone.  In other words, you're guaranteed to see plenty of gut wrenching scenes, such as a janitor sweeping up urine for 5 minutes, a man using a high pressure sprayer to gradually clean smeared feces off the wall, bloody bed sores, naked men beating each other up, people being beaten to death, vomitting, spitting, masturbation, and Bobby Sands' starving body.  If you are impressed by uncompromising visual effects and these scenes still impress you, then maybe you'll like the movie.

However, if you're like me, you're not easily shocked by such things, you'll probably find the movie to be boring.  Because aside from the shock value in the scenes that I described, there is nothing to this movie.

When used effectively, especially in a movie that is based on a true story like the 1981 hunger strike, the brutal events that took place in the prison maze CAN be used to make one heck of an inspiring and moving film.  Unfortunately, this did not occur in ""Hunger.""  It is shock value and brutal visual scenes WITHOUT a story line, WITHOUT character development, WITHOUT dialog and ultimately, WITHOUT emotion and meaning.

Here is why:
- the movie does not do enough to put the hunger strike in context, all of the emotion and desperation that was attached to the 1981 hunger strike is shockingly absent in this film.  Rather than context and story development, the makers of the film tried so squeeze as many visually shocking scenes into the movie as possible.  It left little time to actually develop the plot.
 - the character development is poor.  There are only a few characters so there was an ample opportunty to develop them deeply and with detail.  However, you hardly get to know any of them.  Dialog is almost absent and when it is present, it is only shock value dialog, vulgarity, sarcasm, and cynism.
-The ending is very abrupt.  If you actually watch the movie, you'll see how the abrupt ending makes sure that even the small amount of drama and emotion that was left, is stolen.  You'll be bored by the time the movie ends, but you'll still be expecting the makers of the film to be able to produce some sort of lasting emotion.  They fail.

The makers of the film had the luxury of a very dramatic event and had the opportunity to make a great movie.  But they cheapened the 1981 hunger strikes by only using them to create a shock value movie, devoid of any plot or meaning.",1267920000,17,2673,4.632696390658174
3681740,4,B001L7XND2,"It seems false to say that ""Hunger"" dramatizes the events surrounding the hunger strike of Irish Republican Bobby Sands in the Maze Prison that made news around the world in 1981. Steve McQueen's film does not so much dramatize the bizarre conditions and battle of wills inside the Maze as it shows them to us. ""Hunger"" is a film of images with very little dialogue. It's fantastically cinematic, until, about halfway through, it is interrupted by a 22 minute conversation between Sands (Michael Fassbender) and Catholic priest Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham) in which the IRA radical and the moderate Catholic lay out their conflicting views of how Irish Republicans should proceed. An almost entirely aural experience in the middle of a highly visual film.

By 1981, over 2,000 people had been killed in ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, as republicans and unionists battled over the future of British rule, and the British tried to keep the peace while tending to support the unionists. The Maze prison housed 75 IRA militants who were convicted of crimes. When we enter the prison in 1981, they're on a ""blanket"" and ""no wash"" strike. They refuse to wear prison uniforms, so they go naked except for a blanket, and they refuse to bathe or cut their hair. They smear excrement all over their cell walls and destroy their accommodations as best they can to protest their status as prisoners, while the prison officers are forced to cope with this situation with varying degrees of passivity and force.

""Hunger"" doesn't give much hint of why the prisoners are protesting or what they hope to achieve with these actions or with the later hunger strikes. (They were trying to force the British government to recognize them as political prisoners rather than criminals.) Steve McQueen and co-writer Enda Walsh are more concerned with conveying the bizarre circumstances that leads to warped behavior on the part of both prisoners and guards, and its emotional toll. It is startling how clearly smells and tactile sensations come across through the use of images. Close-ups on detail, meticulous production design, and no distracting dialogue are a powerful combination. This sensory experience emphasizes the primitivism to which both sides of the conflict have resorted.

Some say the IRA supported the hunger strikes to garner international support and improve their recruiting in Northern Ireland rather than out of concern for the political status of the prisoners. ""Hunger"" doesn't take a stance on British rule, IRA violence, or even whether Bobby Sands and his fellow strikers were delusional pawns or martyrs to a just cause. It contents itself with showing us the strange situation that the politics of Northern Ireland created inside the Maze prison at that time -and the deaths and damage to prisoners and prison officers that resulted. Steve McQueen has admirably combined the sensory impact of photographic art with the humanity that the actors bring to their roles to take the viewer inside a strange and disturbing conflict that played out nearly 30 years ago.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2010): There are 4 featurettes and a theatrical trailer (1  min). ""Steve McQueen"" (17 min) interviews the director about how he uses the camera, contrast between the Maze and normal life, his research, and the film's reception. ""The Making of Hunger"" (14 min) interviews McQueen, writer Enda Walsh, producer Robin Gutch, and the cast. ""Michael Fassbender"" (14 min) is a 2008 interview by film critic Jason Solomons about preparing to play Bobby Sands and making the movie. ""The Provos' Last Card?"" (45 min) is a segment from the BBC news program ""Panorama"" in 1981. Journalist Peter Taylor looks at the political situation in Northern Ireland through interviews with Sinn Fein, Democratic Unionist, and Labour Party leaders, and others. This is helpful in understanding the political situation surrounding the hunger strikes if you are not British or Irish and need some education on the subject.",1267833600,2,4011,5.136294027565084
3681741,5,B001L7XND2,"This is hands down one of the best films of the past decade for me.  ""Visual Artist"" Steve McQueen captures a sense of humanity in a way that few directors seem to be in touch with, telling a powerful story in a fashion that most are afraid to.

There is very little dialogue - and the dialogue that exists comes in spouts like an 18-minute long scene where the camera stays still and doesn't cut away at all.  It could have easily been pretentious, but it is not in the least.  McQueen has proven himself just by this one instance to be an extraordinary visionary that knows how to tell a story vividly without having to ""tell"" it.  Did I mention the cinematography is gorgeous?  Practically everything in ""Hunger"" is honed to perfection, and Michael Fassbinder's gruelingly tangible performance shows human deterioration at its most believable.

A masterpiece.",1265155200,37,862,4.783783783783784
3681742,5,B001L7XND2,"In spite of the care and patient control with which this powerful film is shot and edited, ""Hunger"" is a deeply visceral and moving film, featuring a brilliant performance by Michael Fassbender in the lead role.  There are scenes of violent and intense brutality here, but what is more powerful are the simple shots, of a face, of a look, of a gesture, washing hands, of sores on the back of a dying prisoner.  While the film is based on real events, with deep political ramifications, the film itself is not so much political as a plea for humanity, that sides with the wounded sensitivity detected in the eyes of those guards who had been unable to desensitize themselves to the routinely brutal treatment they gave to the prisoners in an effort to break their spirits, as much as it sides with the humanity in the dehumanized IRA prisoners it depicts.

The film details the horrific prison conditions that motivated IRA leader Bobby Sands to begin a hunger strike in 1981, that led to his death and that of 8 other prisoners, but also eventually won some concessions for the IRA prisoners, that they had been unable to achieve in any other way.  The film opens on one of the guards, washing his hands of the violence he'd inflicted on a prisoner but also unable to wash away his own sense of culpability and fear, and, later, unable to build a connection with the other guards who seem more immune to what they do.

It isn't until about a third of the way through the film that we are introduced to Bobby Sands, who is clearly something of a leader among the men, and it isn't until the final third of the film that Sands takes center stage, and embarks upon the hunger strike that gives the film its title. This is not so much his story as the story of a situation, that affected all who were involved in a number of ways.  There is very little in the way of back story here - it is all about the immediacy of the situation, in which the past is mostly irrelevant and what matters is the continuation of the struggle for recognition, as something other than common criminals.  What I found fascinating (and brilliantly depicted here) was the core paradox of their prison rebellion: that in order to win recognition as human beings and soldiers whose cause was unpopular but not evil, that in their struggle for equality, they had to debase themselves, to reject clothing, to smear feces on the walls in protest, to exploit and attack their own bodies as a demonstration of the inhumanity of their treatment.

The film is told mostly through carefully controlled visuals, chiaroscuro with a wide range of tonality between the darkest darks and the brightest whites and colors, with a minimum of dialogue, except during a powerful and lengthy exchange between Sands and a priest about his decision to embark on a new hunger strike, and his willingness to take it all the way.  While director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor) has a very distinctive style, his approach here reminded me somewhat of Robert Bresson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-Escaped/dp/B0001Y4LE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man Escaped</a>.  Both films tell their story in a minimalist style, with carefully controlled framings that show only what is necessary to capture the impact of events, leaving aside all that is superfluous.  The camera frames bodies and faces very tightly, in medium and close shots, inside the actual prison cells, and only opens up more wide to convey the depth of the prison corridor, or to contrast the openness of the visitor's room or the out of doors with the closed off nature of the cells.

Apart from being overwhelmed by the intensity and importance of the subject matter - this is a story that needed to be told, from inside, and I can't imagine a better telling than this - apart from all that I was stunned by the power of the filmmaking.  This is one of the most impressive directorial efforts I've seen in a long time, and an amazing debut by Steve McQueen, and I expect it will be recognized as one of the most important films of this decade by the film historians who care about substance and style over commercialism and buzz.  This is definitely one to have for the library of the film lover who likes to study films; there's a lot to learn here.  I can't say how happy I am that Criterion is doing the releasing on this one.

3681743,5,B001L7XND2,"What do I write about first? That the story of Bobby Sands's hunger strike speaks to human nature's worst and best actions? Or that this is the finest piece of art cinema ever offered to the public? The viewer is brought into the prison, the violence, with barely a word. Only amazing visuals and sounds place us in the scenes. Interviews with director Steve McQueen and actor Michael Fassbender suggest the point of the film is not to be a political film that takes sides in the conflict in N.I., as their intent was to be sympathetic as well as critical of all sides by portraying the situation with realism. And the realism is not for the faint of heart. Beyond the visualization of the hunger strike, I think this film would appeal to anyone who is studying the art of film making because it breaks conventions of Hollywood quick edits, fast pacing, ambitious scores and dialogue-driven plots. Uncomfortably, we are given plenty of time to take in each scene. Often this is beautifully rendered with close-ups and exquisite lighting. Remarkably similar to viewing extraordinary paintings that powerfully communicate our human history.

That being said, what remains in this film just did not engage me in any significant way with the IRA or the man himself.  Physical brutality and filth are the only suggestions of where his desperation came from.  A meandering conversation with a sympathetic priest is the only evidence of where his resolve came from.  The third act is a cold and clinical study of death just as one might witness in a hospice center.  A lot of viewers will give this five stars only because they feel the seriousness of the subject demands it.

I knew it took place during the hunger strikes in Ireland, starred Michael Fassbender, and directed by Steve McQueen. If that's not a sure fire combo, I don't know what is. I don't think I was sure what I was in for when this blu-Ray started playing. It surprised me quite a bit. It's very much like 3 movies in one; highlighting the conditions for guards during this time(mainly one of them). , two prisoners setting the tone for how brutal conditions were in said prison, and then Bobby Sands beginning the hunger strike.the tone of the film is incredibly dark, with tension and violence reaching lethal levels. The amount of gruesome imagery is uncomfortable to watch at times, but compelling as hell. It's shot brilliantly, the still shots and the tracking shots alike, except for a few with low frame rates. In terms of performances, this film nails it, with one of the best performances I've seen from Michael Fassbender. It's amazing how much emotion an actor can convey in just a few subtle facial expressions. As much as I like many parts of this film, the 3-story plot line feels a little bit disjointed at times. If there were a little bit more focus on Bobby Sands, and a little less on the two other prisoners, the film could have benefitted. Despite those flaws, I was riveted from start to finish, especially by this 15-minute scene between Fassbender's character and a pastor friend of his. The shot remains still for that long and continues to captivate me from start to finish. I don't want to spoil the entire film, but check it out, it's definitely worth your time to not only see a brilliant filmmaking triumph, but what these people actually went through.",1472860800,,1777,4.680511182108626

The story is painfully sad and carries the message of what the Irish, the IRA were trying to send. Their story seems clear. What is unclear is why their own countrymen continued to push back against them. The IRA rebels did terrible things. But why didn't Northern Ireland support them against the British?

<15 YEARS A SLAVE> made me think like, ok this guy wants a lot of awards, ha?
Imagine, winning 233 awards from all over the world? It's a new world record.

Then this movie. Anothe stone cold. No warm blood, no warm heart.

The story is  pretty much predictable.
It's about a man who is in a prison who denies to eat for protest. It's called HUNGER strike.
It's more of a politic matter.
This reminds me of Christian Bale who acted as a guy loosing hundreds of pounds for acting pure acting's sake.
Michael Fassbender did the same thing. He even not be afraid of being totally naked just like he did from the movie <SHAME>.
Actually he worked with Steve McQueen more then once and I think they will work again.
They are a perfect couple.

This movie has not a lot of cuts not to disturb the actor's motion and keep the actors from concntrate what they are doing.
Most of the scenes are shot with just one take.
Camara are rather very simple, no music no cheating.
It's all pure streight forward.

It shows everything from prisoner paiting the wall with their poops to the guards bitting the prisoners to the prisoners never shaving, never washing, never eating and have swelling all over their back and have so much pain to chaged their shape and bacomes totally bonny.

You will just have to watch all that with bare eyes.

3681762,5,B001L7XND2,"Having read some of the other reviews, I cannot connect to any of those who viewed this as ""art"".  This was life in the Maze and Long Kesh for those suspected of IRA involvement in the late 70's and early 80's.  I was not a prisoner, but I knew many friends and family members of those who were and what is depicted in this film is as close to truth as it gets.  It was brutal, it was inhuman, it was wrong and to this day the British will try to defend it as they spent 35 years defending how their soldiers murdered innocent civilians in Derry on Bloody Sunday by saying the British Army was under attack by the IRA, a fact long denied and finally admitted to by the British government.  I cheered when the sadistic prison guard was shot as he visited his mother.  Had someone asked, I would have gladly done it myself.  Now we complain about the cruelty and brutality of Isis.  Then, we who lived under the yoke of British occupation had the same complaints about the British army.  All that has changed is the locale and the name. I watched this film and cried when those men were beaten and subjected to such dehumanizing treatment.  And my heart soared when I remember the sacrifice (not suicide by the way, but an ancient form on Celtic protest) of those ten young men, and all the others who came before and after.

3681765,5,B001L7XND2,"This movie takes place in Jeruselem during 1727. Germany just invented airplanes and the world is in dissaray. The story is about a man that has not eaten in 34 years. Doctors and scientists all are astounded at the fact that he had no Hunger at all. Soon after evil Australian kangaroo herder scientist travel to America to find out how this is done, they devise a plan to sell the secret to Germany. Ben Afflack hears of what they are attempting to do and launches an op to end hunger once and for all. He launches a top secret plan known as argo. After getting his guys across the Mexican border and deep into the Mexican tundra, he finds out a evil and horrifying secret... There are no Taco bells in Mexico. Out of pure and utter fear he leaves his team, who are all deported to Guam in the dust as he quickly heads to the nearest drive through in search of the answer to Hunger, the infamous gordita!! Once Ben sinks his teeth into it he gets poisoned by the ecoli monster and because the only good place to eat is tacobell everyone eventually dies or goes hungry. What I never could have expected was that once poisoned, the burritos began to eat people. The screams were gut wrenching as I watched this artistic portrayal of a chulupa dipping a child in Verde and hot sauce. I was a bit ashamed, as I felt sad and hungry all at the same time. I know you may feel sad for the human race but not to worry Jason statham soon arrives and gets into a kungfu battle royal with the tortilla wrapped evil doers. In the end he marrys a quessedilla and he eats her on their honeymoon. It was an OK flick.

It is a grueling, agonizing film, not so much watched as experienced. Steve McQueen is such a gifted director--there were so many stylistic elements of his direction that were very reminiscent of another film he directed about people pushed to the very limits of human endurance, ""12 Years a Slave""... long, sometimes uncomfortably long, camera shots, graphic, unflinching brutality, overall sparsity of dialog, and protracted periods of silence in which the actors convey intense emotion without uttering a single word. Michael Fassbender is Bobby Sands, and his performance is intense beyond words--I think this is probably his best role.

3681811,5,B001L7XND2,"The Film is like an oratorio fort he death of Bobby Sands in a British prison in Northern Ireland in 1981 after a sixty-six day hunger strike. He was only the first one to die in a series of nine and it took nine lives to be wasted for the British government and Margaret Thatcher to yield on all the demands of the prisoners except the status of political prisoners.

The film does not rewrite history and we are supposed to know this most abominable episode of the inglorious war in Northern Ireland. The British had no future there but after this dramatic event the British had lost any moral or political claim in Northern Ireland which was both part of Ireland and not British at all, except as a brutal colony.

The film just gives us a believable vision of this horror: the refusal to wear prison uniforms, hence the locking up of the prisoners in absolutely unbearable semi-isolation with nothing to wear but a blanket, thence the refusal to wash and the frightening painting of the cells by the prisoners with their own excrements. Then they had to be taken one by one to be forcefully shaved and washed up in a bathtub with a lot of violence and beating up. The only right they had was that of common criminals: a visit by relatives every so often, or rather every so rarely. Then they accepted to put on a pair of black trousers: the only moment when they were dressed.

The hunger strike on March 1, 1981 was the most drastic decision and the film tries to listen to Bobby Sands' arguments when he discusses them with his priest. We have to listen to those of the priest too, essentially that it was vanity that moved them because they were looking for martyrdom and if they died, the priest said, it would only be suicide. And we know what that means in the Catholic Church.

Then the visual depiction of Bobby Sands' death is very graphic. The hatred of some of the nurses and auxiliaries was obvious, including their having UDA tattooed on their fingers so that the prisoners could know where they stood and this UDA capital letters were tattooed on the hitting phalanxes of the fist. The violence was not only real but also symbolical.

In fact the film contains little dialogue because the objective is to show the humiliation and the violence and nothing else on one hand and the resistance on the other hand. On one hand you had animals of prey torturing their prisoners. On the other hand you had prisoners reduced to be animals and building their dignity in pushing it to the end of the line, to death if necessary and it was necessary for nine of them.

An extremely disturbing film showing how low the British fell in this war and they even stooped too low to be able to conquer anything. They just failed and were defeated.

3681812,5,B001L7XND2,"Beautiful, painful, horrifying and riveting. There are few movies which are really able to shift the way you see the world, but this movie has hit the mark.

During the scenes  that spend way longer on a given moment than any other movie would do (except maybe a Chinese film) you are given space to let the rapid intensity of the previous scenes sink in and rattle around. The dialogue between Bobby Sands and the priest is a masterpiece of reverse climax. I admit I needed subtitles to catch everything, but I loved it nonetheless.
I read one review that found the pace and angles pretentious, but this entirely misses the beauty of films and the range of artistry that is completely avoided by most film makers.

Romantic comedies are comfortable, interesting and predictable, but this film is unsettling and visceral and stands up next to the real and passionate people who give their lives to see the world a more just place.

This definitely works at the vocabulary of art cinema rather than popular entertainment (I'm not saying that's inherently good, or bad).

This is more or less crap to me because there's not story per se, and I discern no meaningful reason for anyone to watch this.  It encourages reflection - but on what?  This takes me to my third word choice ...

The director's real interest seems to be in sadism.  In each of his films, he takes suffering and bleakness and does to them what pornography does to sex - amps it up beyond naturalism and then throws it out for consumption.  Here he traffics in the freakshow of his lead actor becoming deliberately undernourished - wow, now that's a movie.  McQueen's real sadism is towards his audience.

So I watched it. I put aside my food though, as there was some gross scenes with feces and things, but there wasn't any speaking. It starts with some guy who I gathered later was some sort of guard at the prison. It shows him in his house, and then at the facility. We keep seeing him take off his ring, put it on the sink, and then soak his blistery and bloody knuckles. We don't know what the deal is with that. Then it goes to a prisoner. He gets put in a cell with another prisoner who has been there a while. We still haven't heard much speaking at all. They smuggle in drugs from girlfriends and stuff. They are naked except for during visitation because they refuse to wear clothes.

That was for half an hour. (At least 20 minutes, but I'm pretty sure longer than that). I was going crazy, waiting for something interesting to happen. Some explanation. Anything!

But it just continued on in this booooring, horrible torturous non-eventful way. I had to turn it off because I was falling asleep.

3681856,4,B001L7XND2,"Hunger (Steve McQueen, 2008)

Even if Hunger were a ten-minute short--nothing but the central scene where Bobby Sands (Prometheus' Michael Fassbender) is outlining the plan for the hunger strike, and then defending that plan, to Dominic Moran (The Wind that Shakes the Barley's Liam Cunningham), it would be a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Steve McQueen (Twelve Years a Slave)'s directorial debut, an examination of the 1981 hunger strike that changed the face of Belfast-IRA relations, is a powerful piece of work indeed, and much of that is down to Fassbender.

The plot, for those not up on your recent history: in the early eighties, Northern Ireland removed Special Category status from IRA prisoners, classifying them as common criminals rather than prisoners of war. (Special Category status had been granted in 1972, as part of the same negotiations that led to the release of folk hero Gerry Adams.) This led to a string of increasingly extreme protests, with the hunger strike organized by Sands being the last, and most extreme, of the lot, lasting seven months and resulting in the deaths of ten men before being called off. As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the second half of the film deals with the hunger strike; the first half sets the scene, showing graphically what life was like for the prisoners once Special Category status had been revoked, as well as the effects of some of the ongiong protests (the blanket protest and the dirty protest are specifically mentioned in the title cards; give wikipedia a look for information if the film doesn't give you enough).

McQueen is a vastly talented director, and there is a lot of credit to be given to the ability to take what is essentially the story of seventy-five men sitting around doing nothing for seven months and making it into a film as tense as it is. But the real hero of the tale of the making of this film is Irish playwright Enda Walsh (Disco Pigs), who penned that pivotal central scene, as well as the rest of the dialogue here. That's just as important as McQueen's arresting steadicam shots (who knew a janitor sweeping a wet hallway could be so riveting?), and with actors of the caliber of Fassbender to deliver that dialogue, there's really no way this movie could be a loser. But I didn't expect it to be quite as brilliant as it is, and that's something. ****",1367452800,,2356,4.783783783783784

3681859,5,B001L7XND2,"I have no objection to Truth. Do you? How could you, honestly?

And I have no objection to Art. Hey, some of my best friends are artists.

Most of the many favorable reviews of this film Hunger laud its artistic achievement. Perceiving Art is a totally subjective matter, but most of ""us"" are modestly certain that we know Art when we see it. This film is indeed artfully made. Brilliantly so! And artfully acted. One has to wonder how Michael Fassbender survived the making of Hunger; the ravages to the body of his character, Bobby Sands, are horrifying to behold. Much is horrifying in this film. The brutality and squalor depicted in the Maze Prison of Northern Ireland, where the 1981 IRA no-wash, no-uniform, and hunger strikes took place, are Holocaust-level horrifying. The film is not a narrative, not a thriller, certainly not an entertainment. It's a depiction of horror, and it's absolutely obvious that director Steve McQueen and his cast of actors are convinced of the Truth of their depiction. ""Conviction"" is very convincing.

But that drags me screaming up against the question of the relationship between Truth and Art. Art demands subjective verification. Truth, however, pleads for objectivity even while the Art remains ineluctably subjective. After all, Art is made by Artists, who are fearsomely plausible even when they're wrong. Trust me, I'm not asserting that Steven McQueen was wrong, or that the depiction of the Maze Prison is inaccurate! But I don't know! If this were a book of supposed scholarship, I'd be hell-bent on determining its factuality. But it's Art! I'm touchy about Art that exists chiefly to portray a Truth. Is ""Art that Lies"" better than ""No Art at All""? Think of the DW Griffith film ""Birth of a Nation"" - the filthiest Lie ever told but almost revered for its ""artistic"" innovations. No wonder many people shun ""Art as Truth"" in favor of ""Art as Entertainment.""

Your reaction to this film will depend on your attitude toward the strife in Northern Ireland. The closest thing to an ""adversary"" or villain in this motion picture is the voice of Margaret Thatcher, which you'll hear over a dark screen. I confess that my disapproval of Thatcher and Thatcherism is potent enough to tip my sympathies toward the IRA strikers all by itself.

The heart of this film is a single conversation between Bobby Sands and a Catholic priest with IRA connections. It's filmed Bergman-style with an unmoving camera at chest-height. It illuminates both the violent brutality that precedes and the wrenching tragedy that follows. If the Belfast accents and slang make it hard to follow the dialogue, don't be too proud to use the subtitles.

Regardless, I found this film masterful, because it uses the artistry of cinema to establish a third-person perspective of the events taking place at HM Prison Maze. I don't feel that the film tries to support republicans or loyalists, the cinematic perspective seems fairly unbiased. For many, yes, it would be heart-wrenching to watch someone starve to death, something we observe in the physician's response to Bobby starving, but we also see an officer shot point-blank in front of innocent people during his visit to a nursing home to see his mother. I also don't feel that the film is intentionally trying to ""shock"" anyone. The way everything is presented, from feces on the prison walls, to men being beaten, and finally self-inflicted starvation, the film seems to strive for neutrality. We as an audience are observing, and being allowed to develop individual opinions about what is taking place in front of us. It's a very poetic film, in that it understands silence and subtlety.

There is one particular scene that did have a great amount of dialogue; this specific scene is the meeting between Sands and Father Dom where they have an authentic, immersive thought-provoking conversation. The entire film is very interesting, down to the painful ending. Michael Fassbender is amazing in this film, and so is the rest of the cast.

3681867,4,B001L7XND2,"I think Steve McQueen has to be one of the most interesting directors working right now. I loved Shame, which was so multi-layered I think you could teach a class on it. Hunger was similarly well put together. I liked the structure - the first and last parts had minimal dialogue, while the middle had this dynamic discussion between Bobby Sands and his local priest. Book-ending this brilliant discussion with near silence was a clever move.
One scene that struck me particularly was of a guard cleaning up the prisoners' urine in the hallway - the prisoners would use their leftover food to make ""waterways"" to guide their urine out under their doors at the same time to make a mess in the hall. There's a long, silent scene of the guard first splashing disinfectant (presumably) over the puddles, then, starting at the far end of the hallway, push-brooming the mess down the hall, sometimes pushing it under the prisoners' doors, then all the way down the hall. It was a scene that required patient viewing, but in retrospect, it made me think about how that was one of the few ways the inmates could protest, and yet how useless it was, as if their very voices were simply being shoved back at them or tossed down a drain. And yet despite the futility, they kept working in unison to protest. It was also another instance of using food, the very stuff of life itself, as a means of rebellion.
I doubt there are many other actors with enough talent too pull of the role of Bobby Sands as powerfully as Michael Fassbender, who manages to be riveting despite, or even perhaps because of, a lack of dialogue.
One minor issue is that film assumes you know what was going on politically at this time. I don't have a lot of knowledge of that unsettled period, but even so, I was able to appreciate the situation. Not quite as stunning as Shame, but very much worth watching. View it when you have a quiet couple of hours, because it's going to draw you in and hold you.

It's really not even a fault, just something that people will probably have trouble with).

3681869,5,B001L7XND2,"The film treats Sands less as a Christ-like martyr or an Osama-like terrorist, and more as an old time Robert Ripley curio- a believe it or not. Margaret Thatcher, on the other hand, is never seen, merely heard, as almost a Dickensian wraith of malignance and idiocy, and these dual treatments- the brutalizer as bodiless and the brutalized as slowly debodied, are a great example of the subtle poesy the film employs. Technically, the film is interesting in how it juxtaposes image with sound, and sometimes allows sound to be the dominant sense. From early scenes of a guard, outside in winter, smoking a cigaret, and hearing exhalation, to the rancor in multiple scenes of violence, McQueen uses synaesthesia better than just about any other film director around. Also, he makes grand use of the long take, clearly influenced by the works of Theo Angelopoulos and Bela Tarr. In the subgenre of `prison film,' Hunger blows away other lauded films, from Cool Hand Luke to Midnight Express, which are conventional melodramas, in comparison. But, in achieving his realism sans much dialogue, McQueen also shows that he is, in a sense, the anti-Cassavetes, for where Cassavetes achieved such realism with dialogue, in great films like Faces and The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie, by letting characters speak as in real life, McQueen allows characters to react and brood, as in real life. In Cassavetes films, the self is defined by interactions with other selves. In McQueen's film, self is delineated by interaction with oneself.

  The screenplay, written by McQueen and Enda Walsh, has many good moments, such as the clean clothes the Brits force the Irish to wear to receive visitors (Otherwise they are naked, in protest of wearing criminals' clothes), a masturbation scene wherein one prisoner, in a cell smeared with feces, somehow feels embarrassed to waken his cellmate with the sounds of his self-pleasure, the scene of how the Brits need to powerwash the excremented cells, only to have the prisoners returned to the cells and break their cots and other furniture in protest- again inflicting almost as much brutality on themselves as the Brits do. And these scenes show exactly why the Brits are so intransigent, since the Irish are so willing to live down to their stereotypes of them. Another technique that McQueen uses over and again is showing brief snippets of a scene, then cutting away, to let the viewer imagine how the rest will play out; but the key is that he never cuts too early, so that the viewer is bewildered as to what is going on. David Holmes soundtrack is one of the best ever recorded, in its use of ambient sound. The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt is precise and emphasizes emotional and visceral reactions in the characters to impart the same to the viewer.

  All of these things contribute to the film's greatness, and the film's own lack of pretension only amplifies this fact, in an odd recapitulation of how the use of sound amplifies emotion throughout the film. It's little wonder that this film won the Camera D'Or, the prize for best first feature film, at the Cannes Film Festival, the year of its release, it deserved to. What is odd is some critics comparing the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini's ignominious disaster, Salo, simply because feces plays a role in both films. Nonetheless, Hunger is, unlike Pasolini's film, a great work of art, and here's hoping that McQueen does not go the way of David Gordon Green, in selling out to the Lowest Common Denominator of the masses.

Chronicling the final weeks of the life of Bobby Sands, the IRA activist who, while in prison, embarked on a hunger strike that killed him after 66 days, the film also depicts the brutal conditions endured by Sands and his fellow inmates. The deplorable conditions, merciless beatings, and abject hopelessness are portrayed in a startlingly bleak and powerful manner. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Sands is utterly remarkable, and the 17-minute scene at the center of the film--in which Sands and his priest discuss the merits of the hunger strike and Sands' motives for going through with it--is both crucial to the plot and a strikingly simple yet bold cinematic gambit that delivers a profound thematic and dramatic punch.

3681876,5,B001L7XND2,"Steve R. McQueen's harrowing and unforgettable film about the final weeks of the 1981 Hunger Strike in Long Kesh HM Prison Maze led by Irish patriot and PIRA volunteer Robert Gerard ""Bobby"" Sands is nothing short of a tragic masterpiece from start to finish. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the ill-fated Sands is beyond exceptional and the movie is filmed in a grim, quiet fashion that appropriately suits the mood of the atmosphere of this important true event. In one gripping long scene, Sands converses and argues with visiting Belfast priest Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham). An unmoving camera is trained upon these two protagonists for what must be nearly half an hour, as Sands reveals his plan for a new hunger strike and defends his methods of achieving political goals, ultimately berating what he sees as the priest's despondency and inertia. This is art with a capital A. The pace, at times snail-like, allows you consider in real detail the situation these men found themselves in. The overall triumph of the film is that it makes no judgements but does not sit on the fence - it invokes the viewer to do that themselves. It really is quite remarkable that Mr. McQueen can achieve this so consistently.

'Hunger' will no-doubt be traumatic for some, however, it remains as one of the most utterly compelling pieces of cinema I have ever seen about one of the most important figures in Irish history.",1321747200,4,1422,4.9004149377593365

It's so shocking to see how inhumane and cruel people can be to another and how the government allows such tortures. I've never understood the concept of being cruel to someone because they have done something wrong. I was always raised that 2 wrongs does not make it right and that we as humans don't have the right to judge only God does. Don't get me wrong I believe people should be punished and serve their time for committing a crime but doesn't give one the excuse to be evil in return, it appalling.

The cinematography was beautiful. Steve McQueen is a genius. I can't wait to see more works from him in the very near future. As for Michael Fassbender he was the most touching of all in the film. Wow is his performance was wonderful.

3681878,2,B001L7XND2,"This film is certainly a strong piece of cinema but for me it was ultimately unsatisfactory.  I had expected a deeper exploration into the questions around the basis for the hunger strikes but this film presents such an extreme vision that it's hard to respond beyond a simple visceral reaction.  Perhaps it's because it's a subject I'm more familiar with than most (I had relatives living in NI during this time) that I expected more.

There's not much in the way of nuance here.  The hunger strikers were clearly not political prisoners (in that they were locked up for terrorist acts not for holding or espousing controversial political views - which is normally what we mean by a political prisoner) but this isn't really explored in depth by the film.  The potentially interesting issue is that they clearly saw themselves as being politically motivated and that drove them to wish to see themselves as much more than simple terrorists.  But again very little of that is explored.  It's more like watching a street brawl.

So for me I can't recommend this.",1318636800,9,1061,4.823204419889502

Perhaps, no other film has depicted with such level of crudeness the real nature of this controversial issue. Sands assumes his own road protesting against the status as political prisioners rather than ordinary criminals.

3681882,3,B001L7XND2,"HUNGER (2007), the first effort by director Steve McQueen, is a dramatization of the 1981 hunger strike carried out by IRA prisoners in Northern Ireland. Seeing themselves as political prisoners, these men demanded to wear their own clothes instead of prison uniforms, have greater visiting rights, and be free from prison work. The most prominent participant in the strike was Bobby Sands, who died after 66 days without food.

The film can be divided into three parts. The first presents the prison conditions that the men suffered before the strike. We see this routine through the eyes of two minor prisoners and a guard. Beatings are regular, the prisoners are left naked with only a single blanket to cover themselves with in freezing weather, and For the most part, the prison officials are portrayed as brutal automatons as stripped of their humanity as the Roman soldiers on Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, which makes the pangs of conscience of a couple of them all the more moving. The second part is a hinge in the action. Sands (Michael Fassbender) comes to the forefront, explaining his motives to a priest (Liam Cunningham) in an ambitious 17-minute single shot. Finally, the last third of the film tracks Sands' weakening and death. Sands' deterioration -- he's soon covered with sores and reduced to a skeleton -- is graphic, and one wonders how the filmmakers did it, because it seems to go well beyond mere makeup effects.

For someone unfamiliar with the Troubles, the prison conditions were sad and outrageous, as if prisoners were treated like this in the early 1980s, then the West was compromising its values of humanity and justice. HUNGER thus introduced me to a sorry episode in recent history and it's valuable for that. However, I'm uncomfortable with the latter half of the story, which goes beyond the principle that everyone, even the incarcerated, deserves humane treatment. Sands is portrayed not only as a man standing up for better treatment in prison, but as a soldier with wider political goals, a lingering desire to unite Ireland by violence. There's also touches of religious symbolism, Sands as Christ figure, which is too pat and downright offensive considering he was an incarcerated terrorist. Yes, even the message that even criminals deserve fair treatment is a noble one, but you've still got to acknowledge that the man's political designs were heinous.

Still, even if the plot is irksome and a couple of shots seem like padding (what's up with the long floor-mopping scene?), there are some fine aspects of the film. The set design is meticulous. Cunningham brings the air of an experienced stage actor into the film, which works surprisingly well.

3681886,4,B001L7XND2,"A deeply disturbing look at the impoverished conditions enforced (somewhat `self enforced') on the political inmates of the Belfast Maze prison system, 1981; `Hunger' definitely succeeds in making the viewer squirm.  With sequences that eloquently (if that adjective is deemed appropriate) showcase walls covered in human excrement and mattresses crawling with maggots and human bodies littered with sores, `Hunger' is a visual feast that's greatest feat is delivered with a deft stroke of the director's hand.

Steve McQueen does a brilliant job here.

`Hunger' opens with a prison guard preparing for the day.  He stands before the mirror and soaks his hands in hot water.  This seemingly insignificant act kind of sets the tone for the entire film.  The pain that is self inflicted only carries on through to the climate of the film itself.

The films first half shows the end of a strike consisting of inmate's refusal to wash and wear clothing.  They huddle naked in their rooms, rooms painted with their own waste.  Soon they are forced out of their cells and into the washrooms by the guards; their beards shaved and their bodies tossed in tubs of water.  Upon returning to their rooms they find it pressure washed and in immaculate condition.  Soon, their hunger strike is set into motion, and this takes the second half of the film in an equally yet separately disturbing direction.  It is within this second half that we are formally introduced to Bobby Sands.  Sands is the ringleader, although his presence is barely acknowledged throughout the films first half.  In a rather intoxicating encounter with a priest (the scene itself is a FLAWLESS stretch of actorly bravado and piercing dialog) we are brought to an intimate understanding of this man and his passions and his intentions.

I just wish the film as a whole lived up to the sum of its parts.

The film really consists of a slew of remarkably crafted sequences, moments, that just don't come together to breathe life into a complete film.  It doesn't feel like a film.  It is very `art house', which is NEVER a deterrent for me, but this film just feels almost too relaxed in its own themes.  These are shocking moments, shocking actions, shocking everything and yet the feeling one is left with is almost numb.  I find it interesting that a reviewer mentioned `Elephant' because I noticed a similar `apathetic' tone to the film, but I think the overall message carried in `Elephant' called for that tone, whereas one is meant to sympathize and become emotionally stirred in this particular story, so that tone is somewhat misleading.

But that's just my opinion.

Still, the film is a visual masterpiece and it is expertly spliced together to create a definitive conversation piece.  Michael Fassbender is stunning here.  I struggle with his category placement, for while he gives the films primary performance, and the film itself is intent on telling his story, he is absent throughout the films first half and while his presence is felt it is almost ghostlike, very much the background essence of McQueen's directorial flourishes.

3681890,5,B001L7XND2,"HUNGER is a work of art - in more ways than one. It resembles to power of the majestic murals and altarpieces created for the medieval cathedrals, art that depicted worldly suffering and bitter realities that eventually promised something better in the future - after death. The film, based on a true event in Ireland of 1981 - the hunger strike and subsequent death of Bobby Sands who believed the only way to make the British government understand the political commitment of the IRA - and it is painted by British artist/writer/director Steve McQueen as a vast triptych.  The first 'panel' depicts the incarceration in the filth of the H-Block in the Maze prison in Belfast: the silent 'narrator' is prison guard Raymond Lohan (Stuart Graham) who we meet as he dresses for work, bathing his knuckles bruised by the beatings of the prisoners he controls. A new character is introduced into the painting as recently arrested IRA member Davey Gillen (Brian Mulligan) who in keeping with the philosophy of his fellow prisoners refuses the prison uniform, opting to be naked and is through into a fecal smeared cell with Gerry Campbell (Liam McMahon).  We follow these two as they breakdown after protesting the living conditions and the beatings of the guards, and a plan for revenge is made. In a poignant scene we see Lohan visiting his demented mother in a nursing home and during Lohan's attempts to share love with his mother an iRA hitman enters and murders him.  The fuse for the repercussions is set.

The middle panel of this triptych is where we meet Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender), shorn of his hair and brutally beaten, in conversation with an old friend, Father Dominic Moran, who came form the same background as Bobby but has been summoned for reasons not immediately explained. This middle panel of the triptych is static in that it is restricted to the two men at a table in the prison, smoking, and interchanging memories and conversation.  In this dialogue we learn the reasons for the long lasting political animosity within Ireland - better than any movie so far - as it is at this point that Bobby informs Father Moran that he will be the first of 75 prisoners to go on a hunger strike.  Despite Father Moran's attempts to show Bobby how futile his concept is, Bobby believes so firmly in his issues that he refuses to abandon his plan, knowing that he will die if the government doesn't respond to the prisoners' demands. (This portion of the screenplay was written by the playwright Edna Walsh and it is brilliantly terse, compact, and emotionally devastating.)

The final panel of the triptych is the gradual, almost silent deterioration of Bobby Sands as he spends the last 66 days of his life refusing all food, growing nearly flaccid from his loss of boy mass, covered with decubitus ulcers, and finally dying. It is a tragic third of the film and one that is so compelling that the viewer almost forgets to breathe.  The manner in which the body of Bobby Sands is cared for is not unlike the tomb of Gesthemane, agonizingly quiet, gentle, and finally ending with a view of the Ireland outside the prison walls with birds flying off in the distance.

Throughout this intense drama there are moments supplied by Director McQueen that share the human side of both ends of the political/prisoner spectrum: during one of the most brutal beating scenes while the guards are in riot gear flailing the prisoners with clubs, we see in a hidden corner one of the prison guards hiding from the melee, crying. And there are moments of conversation between some of the prisoners and their families that are deeply touching.  Michael Fassbinder gives an extraordinary performance as Bobby Sands: to make his hunger strike credible the actor lost weight  to the point of emaciation, and yet this physical portion of his role, appalling though it is, does not compare to the nonverbal language of his face while he ends his life.  This is a magnificent piece of filmmaking  and one that should be shared by everyone who wonders about the history of modern politics in Ireland.

3681891,4,B001L7XND2,"Personally I do not believe that fighting a cause, political or otherwise justifies any type of violence or terrorism.  From the beginning of the film we are introduced to the IRA prisoner on his check into the prison cell.  Long silences, slow motion camera moves on behalf of all participants in every scene are giving an enourmous depth to this movie.  Scenes from the prison are horrifying.  Prisoners are stripped of clothing, their hair is long, beard uncut for months at the time, their cells are smeared with feces and even their family visits are such horrific displayes of conveying messages that one cannot be indiferrent to the prison conditions and treatment of the prisoners.

Everyone is deeply affected by these conditions, not just prisoners and their family members.  Prison guards, prison priest, special forces brought it to squash the last bit of humanity from prisoners are all part of te game.  It is touching to see that the first person to show some level of human compassion is a male prison nurse tending to Bobby Sands, leader who starts hunger strike in order to ensure that prisoner demands are met.  Actor Michael Fassbinder is captivating in his role of the determined 27-year young soldier determined to give away his life in order to gain some humanity in the process both for himself and his fellow soldiers.

Not easy to watch at times, this film is definitely thought provoking.  In certain parts of th emovie we can hear portions of Margaret Thacher's speaches that are eerie, considering that it has been more than 25 years since she has been in power as Britain's Prime Minister.",1276560000,,1619,4.8545454545454545

This is a brilliantly filmed movie that deals with the harsh ordeals of the prison life in the most unpleasant of conditions. The squalid living conditions and brutality are shown in gritty, unflinching detail by McQueen's masterful vision. There is a remarkable 17 minute long shot, the longest in a mainstream film, between a priest (Liam Cunningham) and Bobby Sands, just before the hunger strike, which represents Sands' defiance  and strong conviction.
By any measure this is a disturbing and provocative film.",1276128000,3,772,5.225806451612903
3681893,5,B001L7XND2,"Hunger does what it says on the tin,it abstracts from a polemical,ideological situation about hunger strikes in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland in 1981 and removes the heat of the local personalities and history of the time, and gives us a film based on the individual humanity and decisions of individuals based at a stressful time. We get the essence without the controversy,coming as it does 27 years after the events described. We also get a film maker who has come from making video art works into the strange world of film making with all its taboos and shibboleths. Bobby Sands is the central character but doesn't come in until 35 minutes into the film. So the performance does not shout:this is Bobby Sands,he arrives as an organic part of the central and last triptychs. The films tripartite structure moves through the physical-the sheer claustrophobic hell of physical beatings,to the ideas at the heart of the motivation behind the hunger strike in the immaculate boxing match dialogue,to the wasting away of a human body in its last defence against an all powerful state.

The film opens with taking us through the daily rituals of Officer Lohan(Graham) as he prepares himself for another day's work in prison. He is lonely,suffers stress,we see crumbs dropping as he eats his breakfast. We see him smoking outside and snowflakes falling on his bloodied knuckles. As he leaves and opens his front gate like a prison door,he searches under his car for any bomb devices. In the Maze we see the admission process of another prisoner Brian and his refusal to wear prison uniform,and his receipt of a blanket as he is lead to his cell. Inside his cell, walls smeared with faeces greet him and he is met by Davey. There are scenes where the blanket protest is followed by the `dirty' protest,where prisoners object to having the status of `political prisoner' removed,they smear their cell walls with faeces or they empty their urine under their cell doors into the main corridor where it meets other streams of urine. Also the prisoners don't wash,let their hair grow long, leave food to rot on the cell floor. Every so often the men are pulled out of their cells and made to run the gauntlet of officers in full armoury as they run naked under the blows that rain down on them or they are forcibly scrubbed in a bath by several warders,hair cut. All the prisoners want is to be able to wear their own clothes, freely associate,receive letters and parcels once a week and not be treated like criminals. They have to resort to smuggling thingslike radio receivers up their anus from visitors or concealing paper notes in their mouths. The prison officers,often of the UDA,resent the conditions and stress of their work and the anxiety of being killed themselves as Lohan is when he visitshis dementing mother in an old people's home. Sixteen in all were killed at the time. We get the cold hand of the state with an implacable disembodied voice of Margaret Thatcher on radio.

The central unexpected part of the film is a static two takes 22 minute dialogue shot backlit in the visitors room between Sands(Fassbender) and Father Moran (Cunningham).Before this everything had been filmed without dialogue, setting the context of the dysfunction and degradation of the prison environment. Now Sands goes head- to-head in an argument with the priest .They both start off bantering,then talk of their respective childhoods,Sands telling Moran how he became a leader. They move into more serious gear with Moran arguing that he is speaking to a dead man,why not value his life and family more? Sands wants to be a martyr like Pearse. Sands showing the steel in his determination to go through with the hunger strike to the death as leader of many more. This scene is remarkably intense and has our full attention. There is rhythm as the two dance around,testing each other's mettle. Following this scene there is a warder clearing the corridor of urine,laying down disinfectant,pushing it forward with a squeegee in slow,methodical strokes. This scene is impressive as he moves from one end to the camera at the other where the viewer is. The repetition and the movement serve to underline the dialogue scene. They both take place in real time and help us absorb what has happened.

The final part of the film has a different tone:it is about Sands slowly starving to death over 66 days, so he becomes an emaciated ghost. This largely takes place in the hospital section of the prison in one room. Time passing suggested by meals brought,taken away and replaced by other uneaten meals. As he is lifted there are suggestions of him being like a Christ figure. There are flashbacks to his childhood. As he lies in bed a feather glides down poignantly in one shot,which seems heavier than him. McQueen has spoken of the difficulty of watching even actors beating other actors,where he did the prison beating scene in 6 takes. He also sent Fassbinder away for 10 weeks to diet severely to 58 kg. Due to the trust he created on the film set what he asked of his actors they delivered like performance artists of extreme authenticity. So the camaraderie amongst the film crew was high. Because he is primarily an artist he also evokes the material nature of the faeces,the urine,the physicality of being beaten and starvation,the claustrophobic enclosure and terror. The film was made in N.Ireland. The only thing missing is the collective camaraderie of the prisoners,the singing of songs,the noise. He gives you the minimum of information and mostly lets the images speak,gives the desperation of using the human body as the ultimate form of protest. Shortof narrative the film as body installation speaks more eloquently of that time. A ritualistic tragedy abstracted into
art.",1272153600,9,5781,4.878942014242116

8317552,3,B001L7XND2,"HUNGER is a story that deserves to be told though this brutally realistic film is slow moving to a fault at times. Michael Fassbender puts on a fine performance and Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands, who goes on a fatal hunger strike.

The problem here is we are given so few facts on the characters and the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland. The brutality of the prison guards to the prisoners can be unbearable to watch and it's not clear how a hunger strike to the death will change anything. The main demand of the prisoners seems to be the right to wear their own clothes and not prison uniforms. Is that alone worth a hunger strike. In a poignant scene, Bobby Sands talks honestly to a priest about his planned hunger strike. His parents nor the prison officials try to save him. I remember Bobby Sands being in the news in the day. I wish writer/director Steve McQueen had delved into the issues from both sides. It's never explained what ""crimes"" the prisoners are accused of. Just being members of the IRA? How did Bobby Sands end up in the notorious MAZE prison.

Life in the MAZE is a daily torment and horror to the prisoners. McQueen uses so much valuable time setting a scene rather than explaining what is happening.  The prisoners are on a no-wash campaign and deliberately make their cells filthy in protest. When a room or floor is cleaned, McQueen spends so much time showing a wall being cleaned when it could be better used telling the prisoners' stories.

Again, this is a fascinating look into a tragic and violent time in Northern Ireland. The full story needs to be told.",1495411200,,1600,4.583916083916084
8317553,3,B001L7XND2,"I am am a big Michael Fassbender fan, so I had high hopes going in for this movie. Although I do know some of the history of the IRA movement & fight for Irish independence and had heard of Bobby Sands before watching the movie I really was unaware of the depths and deplorable conditions these (soldiers who many times crossed the line to terroists) subjected themselves to while incarcerated. So before watching the movie I read up on the history of Bobby Sands. And that is where, unless you are from Ireland and know this subject inside & out, or just happen to be a student of this relatively small slice of time when Bobby Sands was incarcerated & ultimately died from a Hunger Strike - I think the average viewer would be TOTALLY LOST. The Irish accents are authentic, but for the average viewer most would need subtitles to follow much of the conversations. I happen to have experience in listening to this accentb but most would not. The movie, in my opinion, just focused on the final hunger strike but not much of the themes from the fight for Irish independence that led to this extreme form of protest & why the prisoners felt they had to utilize it. For the part Michael Fassbender played potraying what he eas given, he did a good job. I just would have enjoyed a movie that delved further in to what part of Bobby Sands psyche drove him to orchestrate these extreme protest methods (hunger strike was not the only one). I get that it is suppose to be an uncomfortable movie to watch just due to the subject matter. It in know way is meant to be a ""feel good"" movie & I get that. I just never felt much sympathy for the character of ""Bobby Sands"" because I didn't really get to know him well enough in the movie to empathize with the drastic measures he was going to in ending his life. Possibly if I had lived in the middle of that particular slice of period of history in Ireland then I might have felt differently. I feel like I learned more from reading the back story on Bobby Sands so I could better undetstand the movie than anything I wayched in the movie (other than that starvation is an incredibly painful way to die). If I had to do it over again I would have just read what I did anout Bobby Sands & skipped purchasing the movie.",1491177600,,2257,4.350710900473934
