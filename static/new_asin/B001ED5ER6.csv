8297783,5,B001ED5ER6,Interesting and exciting view of our efforts in space featuring interviews with the men who made it happen.  A true slice of history.,1389052800,,133,4.782608695652174
8297784,4,B001ED5ER6,"I gave this a four because the length of the main program is only about 18 minutes long but it was a good documentary on the Atlas rocket.
The footage of the main program is color and black and white. There is another program tht is all black and white, and it goes into more
detail on the history of Atlas rocket( is of good quality as well). I liked the music video and the photos of the Atlas rocket. The main
program is of good quality and left me wanting to see more of the Atlas rocket, like the future version of the rocket being planned but
were only mentioned in the program. All in all I would say that an aviation/space enthusiast would enjoy having this as apart of their
collection!",1363392000,,695,4.2330827067669174
