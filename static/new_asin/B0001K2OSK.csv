2008243,4,B0001K2OSK,"Speed, Power, and corny play-a-long tracks are all here, but where is the music? Mind you, I'm not apposed to extreme technique, but I don't hear any music coming out of Mr. Lang; it's like we have become machines to beat the drum machine.

I can't wait until JoJo Mayers 3 vol instructional set comes out, it will put weight lifting muzak DVD's like this to shame. O, and those two players are miles apart- JoJo is a musician, Thomas is a machine ( a crude one at that ). Sorry for all the insluts, but time will reveal these passing extreme fads for what they are- a fad. jb",1105833600,3,576,4.236363636363636
2008244,5,B0001K2OSK,"Thomas Lang is probably the most talk-about drummer on the planet right now, and in ""Creative Control"", he show some of the most useful excerises for all the drummer, no matter what style of drummer you are, what he provide seems to be very difficult to learn at the first sight, but with a few practices, i'm sure everyone will find his excerise make sense and very benefical on building independence and speed, i'd say what his excerises show is ""the least to do with the greatest reward"", just imagine this guy spend 15 something years on modifying his daily pratice rountine, and Creative Control is what it is about.

people always compare Marco, Thomas and Virgil on how ""alike"" they are, but to me they are totally different, Marco represent the more classical-oriented melodic appoach and his dual-ostinato thing is just exceptional, and Thomas repersent the live drum'n'bass, dance beat era of drumming, his multi-hats and the eye-catchy-performance-friendly setup make him one of the most visually excited drummer nowadays, and for Virgil, like his nickname ""the thunder from down under"", is really a thunder, the way he rock and dynamic his give will blow everyone away.

and i really don't see how Creative Control is related to Extreme Drumming concept. Ostinato playing and is one of the most advanced topic in drumming community, Terry Bozzio seems to be the MAN who already dig ostinato back to more than 10 years ago, so maybe we should say that all of this guy ""copy"" Bozzio?! not really.....",1100304000,6,1510,4.89453125
2008245,1,B0001K2OSK,Great production and playing but I can't help but think that Thomas bascically presented ALL of Marco Minnemann's ideas from his book Extreme Interdependence.,1099699200,3,158,5.625
2008246,5,B0001K2OSK,"Thomas Lang is a traditional grip drumset player who is technically the most advanced drummer I've ever heard. His command over the drumset is impressive and his playing impeccable. He is a combination of Virgil Donati, Dennis Chambers and Buddy Rich in one.
This double DVD production has tons of exercices for hands and feet and invaluable ideas for today's drummers. It covers everything form rudiments to cross-sticking. His last solo is memorable. Five stars, no doubt!",1088208000,15,474,5.1688311688311686
2008267,5,B0001K2OSK,"It's a good DVD to learn!!

Good pratice and pdagogie it's very good!

Not musicaly but technicaly!!

Enjoy!!",1177027200,,109,4.944444444444445
2008268,4,B0001K2OSK,"what a fantastic educational drum dvd! this man develops all of his virtuosity in this  dvd and encourage you to improve your skills, around your drumkit. patterns of orchestration, fills, technique (both hands and feet)...everything in is thoght from you to learn in a take a step-by-step method.",1176681600,,297,5.1875
2008269,5,B0001K2OSK,"I bought this used, and it was great, especially for the price!  For any drummer at any level outside of absolute beginner, I would strongly recommend this DVD.  I would rate myself as an above average drummer on a good day, and some of the things Thomas Lang does on this DVD were over my head unless you take the time to sit down and really understand what he's doing.  But there are simpler techniques and ideas that anyone can take away from it.  The guy has AMAZING footwork - this is predominantly a DVD focusing on bass drum, double bass, and hi-hat footwork in general, with some hand stuff thrown in, and hand/foot coordination for good measure.  Lang has amazing speed with his feet, both singles and doubles.  And his 4-way independence is unheard of!  There are exercises in singles, doubles, different time signatures, independence, grooves, stick twirling...  it's 5 1/2 hours long, in 8 sections, so be prepared, I watched it in maybe 3 stages.  There are tunes that he plays inbetween lessons, to exemplify what he's teaching.

The only bad thing I can say about this?  The guy does not know the meaning of the word ""SLOW!!!""

Lang predominantly plays live comparisons of electronic (drum 'n' bass) music, which is generally at a faster tempo, and he does it well!  You can tell his style comes from drum corp, not just because of his traditional grip playing or stick twirling, or the fact that he uses FAT sticks!

In closing, be prepared to be amazed!  And if you're not, then improve your drumming first, so you can appreciate what great drumming is!",1161043200,2,1570,4.658181818181818
2008270,5,B0001K2OSK,"get motivated to study more, share the drumexperience with Thomas.

a good help for drummers whom are already playing (and studying) for some years.

a motivating DVD for starting drummers.",1156896000,2,189,5.266666666666667
2008271,4,B0001K2OSK,I have got to give this Lang some credit. He definitely has the speed. I would like to see him play some fusion but he has shown me techniques in this DVD that I did not believe were possible to do. Especially the speed with his feet. I have never seen a drummer do double strokes as fast and even with accents like this guy does with his bass drum pedals.,1136419200,3,356,4.028169014084507
2008272,5,B0001K2OSK,I purchased this dvd a while ago and finally sat down and watched the whole thing and was completely in awe of lang's technique.  I am a jazz drummer and have implemented some of his practice regimens into my own.  I also have finally broken down and after viewing this bought a double bass pedal which has made practicing much more fun for me.  I believe this dvd will help with your technique no matter what style you practice and seeing thomas lang's control and mastery definitely has me back in the woodshed practicing more which is what a dvd should do.  Two thumbs up.,1118188800,9,575,4.447619047619048
2008273,4,B0001K2OSK,"Just a warning - If you don't have a double bass, you might feel a bit ripped off.  When I saw Thomas in clinic I instantly got this DVD, watched it and felt it was kinda useless boring, and his voice ticked me off.  Then, months later I sat down, determined to learn some stuff off it. Whoa...  I am so glad. Movement and Mechanics is great for solos, and Stick Tricks, is also amazingly beneficial for jazzing up your solos.  I felt a bit left out with all the double bass stuff in there (I remain defiant not getting a double bass), but still there were about 4 chapters that had nothing double bassish in it.  The DVD is great in a sense that it is all transcribed in PDF form, but you need a DVD on your computer to view it.  To epitomize, if you've got a double bass you will love this DVD, if you don't, you'll still  like it, but you won't gain as much from it.",1117929600,7,869,4.046783625730995
2008274,5,B0001K2OSK,"I just received my copy of Thomas Lang's DVD a few days ago.  I ordered after reading all the reviews here, and seeing the online demo's at Hudson music.  WOW!!!!!!!
The people who gave this DVD negative reviews obviously are INCREDIBLY jealous of this ""phenominal"" young drummer, OR, are just beginner drummers and were just ""overwhelmed"", which I could understand.
Thomas is PHENOMINAL!  He has taken the 'art of drumming' to levels I didn't know existed. Buddy Rich would have been PROUD of this young drummer.
I've been playing on and off for 40 years, and was SOOO inspired by this DVD.  All of the exercises are very well explained, and within MOST drummers reach, if he/she is willing to put in the practise.  My boys and I just could not believe how UNBELIEVABLY COORDINATED this young man is.
My 14 year old is on FIRE now for drumming after watching Thomas.
If you want to see drumming taken to the HIGHEST levels of expertise and impeccable playing, then RUSH OUT and buy this.  Be INSPIRED, and get to work....I AM!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",1108339200,10,1054,4.726775956284153
2008275,3,B0001K2OSK,"This is a great dvd for a youngster learning about technique and chops and how to ""smoke"" other drummers with your licks. But if you are an older 21+ musician who believes in the music first, you might not be too impressed. There is nothing wrong with the approach Lang has; he's creative and original in many of his ideas, I just wouldn't recommend too many of these licks while you're playing onstage. The guitar player might turn around and say ""what the F#@% are you doing!""",1107734400,13,478,4.505747126436781
2008276,5,B0001K2OSK,"In reading the reviews that have already been posted I can't help but agree with all of them, the positive and the negative. Certainly the DVD production values are first-rate, and Thomas is extraordinarily good at what he does. On the other hand, there is a definite deficiency in the musicality of the songs he chooses as examples; with the exception of two tracks from Gianna Nannini's amazing album ""Aria,"" everything is very cheesy, rudimentary, and unmusical. Thomas does not demonstrate or seem interested in jazz music (which is fine by me; I'm a metal/rock drummer anyway), so syncopation does not get a lot of air time. Instead Thomas's style seems to be based almost on translating Philip Glass minimalism into percussion -- he assigns repetitive groups of notes to his off-limbs (right hand, left foot) and layers over them a very standard-sounding 4/4 groove with his remaining limbs. Granted, the technique can be very impressive and sound really cool (especially with contrasting odd-meter patterns in the off-limbs), but it starts to feel limited after a while.

This is the first drumming DVD I have purchased, so I don't have a lot to compare it against. I'm certainly glad I bought it, and have not only enjoyed watching it, but also seen my own playing benefit by attempting to incorporate some of the exercises into my practicing. I'm almost certain you will be able to say the same things about it if you bought it (unless of course you're a jazz/blues drummer).",1107129600,11,1484,4.888888888888889
8013545,3,B0001K2OSK,"Lang knows his stuff and is fun to watch. He's a master of technique and one of the most advanced players on the planet.
This dvd however is not the greatest learning tool and may go beyond many novice drummers comprehension.
Worth a watch though - if only for the sheer spectacle!",1457654400,,281,4.423076923076923
8013546,5,B0001K2OSK,My husband loves this set of DVDs! He also got creative coordination and advanced foot technique and he really likes those too. Thomas Lang does a great job at explaining things and there's so much information and things to practice. Definitely recommend!,1429833600,,255,5.095238095238095

8013548,5,B0001K2OSK,"One of the best, most clearly executed DVD's out there on four-way independence. Keep in mind, this is not a DVD to learn how to groove or jam with a band/ensemble. This will make you a monster with regards to hand/foot coordination and independence and you will add quite a bit to your bag of tricks. A drummer SHOULD strive to learn rudiments with his/her feet! Anyone who gave this one star obviously did not know what they were buying! If you want groove, look up Tommy Igoe or John Blackwell. Done.",1409270400,,503,4.478260869565218

8013552,5,B0001K2OSK,"This is an excellent Dvd combo. In my opinion, Thomas Over delivers bringing out all his skill on to the table in a manner where us drummers can understand. Don't get me wrong, the things that he teaches are extrememly hard if you are not used to it. You can learn it in time, if you do you will be proud of yourself. This dvd is for the serious drummer, Not one just starting out. You want to get serious with becoming an amazing drummer? Go through this dvd and learn what it has to offer, when your done...if you get done, Your friends and those who watch you will surely be blown away. It's great!

8013553,3,B0001K2OSK,"Mr. Lang provides a technically rich DVD set here. His technique and speed are amazing. If you are looking for an example of extreme drumming this is definetely a set for you. However, if you're looking for real world examples of grooves to incorporate into your playing, look elsewhere. A big problem I have with the dvd set is his tendency to go from practice speed to extreme too quickly which might lead the listener to believe that they can get to this speed with little effort. When a ""student"" realizes that it takes a lot of practice to get to this proficiency and it is not as simple as Mr. Lang makes it seem it could lead to discouragement. Also, I don't see the real world benefit of practicing these techniques. These are great exercises to practice to get your speed up and develop your independence but the chances that you would incorporate them into the average gig are slim to none. If I did to incorporate most of the ideas presented here into the average gig I would probably be quickly dismissed. However, personally I purchased the dvd to view some great drumming and for that I got my money's worth.",1217894400,4,1122,4.532019704433497
8013554,4,B0001K2OSK,"Lang does a very good job of teaching.  He explains well, demonstrates slowly and then full speed.  The only catch is these techniques are fairly advanced.  Much more so that Steve Smith or Tommy Igoe or even Joe Morello.

If you don't play double bass, the DVD won't do you much good.

As others have noted, his style is rather mechanical and his speed is amazing.  But, he does inspire one to practice more.

For an advanced drummer who wants to improve speed and foot work and practice sessions, this is a fine DVD.  If you are not advanced/professional, look elsewhere, like the 3 DVDs mentioned above.",1198281600,2,606,4.598130841121495
