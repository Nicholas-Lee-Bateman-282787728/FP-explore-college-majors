2702967,5,B000LC4Z94,"The Wiggles really put a lot of effort and thought into their newest DVD. It is ALOT of the Wiggles (no animation, not overloaded in Wiggly dancers), all brand new songs, lots of cute skits and outfits. Anthony's kids are in it and his oldest girl makes appearances as the little Music Box Dancer. The songs are well written and catchy too, makes a great CD. My kids looove this DVD. This is Greg's last Wiggles DVD, well worth the money!",1173744000,19,438,4.419753086419753
2702998,5,B000LC4Z94,"This is The Wiggles at their best!  The songs are fantastic, the dancing is fun, and the story line flows well throughout the film.  My only gripe would be that Mario (one of Captain Feathersword's ""crew"") opens his mouth as far as it will go and bobs his head up and down every time the camera is on him.  It's pretty annoying.  But everyone else is pure gold.  I especially like Kamahl as the ""King of the Road"" and Georgie Parker as the ""Queen of the Rainbow.""  This is Greg's last DVD, and he is wonderful - you'd never know that he was not well.  Jeff is just as funny as ever, he is my 2-year-old daughter's favorite.  She loves to ""wake up Jeff!""  I think this DVD will have a long shelf-life because it should appeal to children from toddlers up until at least school age.  And it's fun for the mums, too!  :^)",1282435200,,818,4.212903225806452
2702999,5,B000LC4Z94,"My three girls (3yrs, 15 mo twins) love love love this DVD. Two of them will watch it without distraction all the way through, and it is really long. They love the dancing and singing, and I would peg it as not too annoying as far as kids DVDs go. It has some bonus features which are nice too. I recommend it very highly to parents with little ones who love music and dancing.",1265414400,,377,4.108108108108108
2703000,5,B000LC4Z94,"I was a little appalled by some of the costumes and storyline of this DVD, but after watching a few times, it's actually quite entertaining.  The main thing is that my 1-yr old is VERY entertained and actually giggled to some parts, so it was worth it.  Up there with Wiggle Time and Wiggly World.",1252368000,,297,4.381818181818182
2703001,5,B000LC4Z94,"My son really liked the songs and dancing.  There was just enough plot to keep him interested and gave rise to questions that showed he had some idea of the points they were trying to make. (Sharing, working together etc.)  The quest stars are a hoot!",1242259200,,251,4.434782608695652
2703002,5,B000LC4Z94,"I must admit, I had doubts about these four grinning guys from Down Under and would never have bought this on my own (it was a gift), but my children do love this - from my ten year old down to my two-year-old.  I love the positive values these four guys promote and the way they teach helpfully without preaching.  Plus, they genuinely seem to have fun doing it.  The bloopers section at the end was fun to watch.

Plus, you've got to admire anyone brave enough to wear a chicken suit and dance around on stage. Well worth the investment.",1240358400,,539,4.306930693069307
2703003,5,B000LC4Z94,This is another great little DVD for the little ones to learn and exercise(dance) with.  The music is just right for their little legs and ears.  This has to one of Australia's greatest exports to the world. All children seem to go through a time when they adore this group.,1235347200,,274,4.46
2703004,5,B000LC4Z94,"What I love most about Racing to the Rainbow is an interactive storybook as part of the bonus features.  My favorite part of this movie was when Captain Feathersword got to see Magdelana the Mermaid, again since Wiggle Bay.

This was the 2nd and last final movie that Greg starred in...before he had to leave.",1224115200,,309,4.6
2703005,5,B000LC4Z94,"This was the first Wiggles DVD we bought ahead of their Racing to the Rainbow concert in 2007 and it doesn't disappoint.  It's a story with many catchy songs, mostly newer tunes.  My kids love it and it is still in heavy rotation along with other Wiggles DVD's.
I also really like the bloopers section at the end.  My 4 yo son doesn't really get it but it's a great addition for the adults.",1207785600,,390,4.243243243243243
2703006,1,B000LC4Z94,"I'm scratching my head as I write this review (seeing all the positive reviews) because my 18 month old daughter absolutely ignored the DVD while it was running and that NEVER happens when the Wiggles are on! I could not stand the songs either. I guess I was looking for the typical Wiggle DVD filled with dances and songs. The songs were all new and unfamiliar and the spoken parts were just too drawn out. I found myself forwarding thru most of the DVD. Dont get me wrong, I love the Wiggles just as much as my daughter, but this DVD was a complete waste of time!",1207612800,2,565,4.289719626168225
2703007,5,B000LC4Z94,"My little boy is 3 and a half years old and this is absolutely his favorite Wiggles of all.  He's seen it probably about 20 times and always wants to watch it one more time.  Because it actually has a plot, it is tolerable the first couple times for the grown-ups too.  TONS of the Wiggles songs and dances, this one is highly recommended!",1197072000,,339,4.265625
2703028,5,B000LC4Z94,"Whether you are a longtime Wiggles fan,or a newbie,this video is very entertaining. It has almost all new music,which is very catchy and well done. The whole video tells the story of The Wiggles and their friends having a race to the end of the rainbow,with music breaks throughout. See Anthony follow his dream and play football with the New England Patriots. And Murray follow his dream of being a rock star (dig those pants!) I won't give any more away,but I highly recommend this dvd. There are also lots of hilarious bloopers to keep you laughing till the end.",1195257600,,565,4.66
2703029,3,B000LC4Z94,"My daughter seems to enjoy this one alright.  It's not great but, it's definitely better than ""Splish Splash Big Red Boat.""  It has more singing and dancing, fewer cartoons, some new characters, and a bit of a storyline.",1191196800,,220,4.7631578947368425
2703030,5,B000LC4Z94,"Since my daughter is going to see this stage production, I bought the video so she would be familiar with the songs.  I thought it would be like a concert like some of the other Wiggle's concert DVD's she has.  It's not, it's more like a movie with a story line.  She still loves it and it's very entertaining.  Just don't expect it to be set up like a concert DVD.",1187740800,,365,4.098591549295775
2703031,5,B000LC4Z94,"My 2 yr old son loves the Wiggles and so do I! Since mom likes the video too, we watch it together, which is more fun for him b/c we talk about it and dance to it together.

The Wiggles are currently touring with their Racing to the Rainbow songs, so I bought this video to prepare my son for the concert that we'll be going to in a few weeks.

We both love this video, and I think this one, along with Wiggle Time, is among their best. This one seems to have gone through some good editing and really has the extra polish that makes it a great improvement from many of their other videos, namely b/c:
- focus is on the Wiggles; less ""clutter"" of background people (we like Captain Feathersword, but some of the movies have too much of him, and the less we see of the corny background dancers, the better.)
- storyline/theme is clear, and they don't stray from it
- sound and video effects enhance rather than overdo
- kids are more diversely represented
- no Wiggles puppets or Wiggles cartoons, thank God! (it's the Wiggles themselves that we want to see!!)
- no hyper-colored cartoon backgrounds (as in Wiggly Playtime; those colors gave me a headache. Seems better for young kids to use real backgrounds, and this video uses plenty of real (and beautiful) footage of birds, flowers, scenery of Sydney)
- catchy, snazzier songs (We love just about all the Wiggles' songs, but these songs have more of a dance beat/rhythm. My son loves to dance to these songs, and has many of the lyrics memorized! We got the CD too!)
- less facetime given to Captain's crew (they are still WAY too bubbly, but at least they are given less facetime than in some previous videos)
- Greg has gained some weight and boy, does he look GOOD! I heard this was his last video--that made us both very sad! Greg is my son's favorite Wiggle.
- Jeff and Murray make less overly-wide-eyed expressions, which in previous videos was a little annoying
- we get to see them drive around in their Big Red Car, which my son can't get enough of
- skits are well-written, nothing seemed too corny (so mom could tolerate and actually enjoy watching the movie with her son)
- bloopers at the end are funny; son doesn't care for them, but mom wishes there were more!
- all 4 Wiggles look like they are having a blast!
- limited dialogue (my son can't sit through too much talking; he enjoys the singing and dancing the most)
- simple hand/body movements that go with the songs, that are easy for a young child to imitate (my son loves to copy along with the motions)
- all the great singing and dancing that we love from the Wiggles

Some of my son's favorite scenes:
- when Greg paints a spider
- when Murray comes forward and dances while playing the guitar in the Tra La La song
- when Benny acts like a teapot and his hat falls off
- any scene with the Big Red Car
- the whole Everybody Dance song/dance",1185926400,17,2870,4.350746268656716
2703032,5,B000LC4Z94,"We received this DVD as a gift for my daughter's 2nd birthday. This is the only Wiggles that she has been exposed to and we are choosy about what she watches. This is a great video and we all enjoy it. My daughter loves to get up and dance with them for almost every song! Especially when they do ballet to ""Music Box Dancer"". (they do a great job by the way) I am pleased that she interacts with this video and it excites her enough to get up and dance. We actually all get up and dance! I hate to see kids mesmerized by TV and just sitting there like a zombie.
I cannot stand Barney, this Wiggles DVD is not near as cheesy or corny or annoying as Barney. Somehow, they don't come off that way which seems weird for middle aged men doing a children's show.",1184457600,,757,4.087248322147651
2703033,5,B000LC4Z94,"I can't say enough good thing about this DVD! It is loaded with new music,all of it catchy and beautifully done. The video tells the story of the Wiggles following their individual dreams on their way to the end of the rainbow,with sometimes hilarious results! Songs are interjected throughout,most notable to me are Bump-a Deedle and Shakin' Like A Leafy Tree. Engaging dance moves for children and grown-ups alike, and smooth as silk vocals from Greg Page. The New England Patriots even join Anthony in his dream of playing American football. There are lots of entertaining bloopers in the special features to keep you laughing till the end. My 4 and 7 year old's love this dvd,and so does their Mom!!Two thumbs way up! We'll really miss you Greg!",1175126400,4,749,4.813953488372093
2703034,5,B000LC4Z94,"I chose five stars for one reason: because this DVD mesmerizes my 18-month-old daughter.  The Wiggles have been favorites of hers for a few months now, but her attention sometimes wanders after several songs.  With ""Racing to the Rainbow,"" she can sit through the better part of what is in the end quite a long presentation without losing interest.  From an adult point of view, I found the narrative thread in this one a little more engaging and coherent than in some of the other discs that try to tell a story (e.g., ""Toot Toot"").

The costumes are also notable in this one -- especially the velvet suits, which bring to mind the 1960s and another (much more famous) quarter.",1174953600,4,678,4.625
2703035,4,B000LC4Z94,"This new DVD has some nice features.  For example there aren't any pesky advertisements at the beginning.  Additionally, the DVD has an auto play feature so I can just put it in and be done.  That is very handy when you are in the middle of preparing dinner.  The reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is that my daughter isn't wild about this one the way she is about Toot! Toot!  Since she is so young (15 months), this is probably because Toot! Toot! is mostly music with very very short skits in between and the skits are always at the Big Red Car.  I'm sure that the repetition paired with all the songs is what draws her in.  The Racing to the Rainbow DVD is the same style - alternating between skits and songs, but the skits contain different locations and topics each time. For an older child, I'm sure the new and exciting topics will be perfect.  Another plus with this DVD is that it is 90 minutes, where Toot! Toot! is only 45.  All in all, I would recommend it.  But I would also recommend Toot! Toot!",1174780800,4,1013,4.229166666666667
2703036,5,B000LC4Z94,"All new songs with a few children's classics - what's not to like? Our daughter is 22 months old and absolutely loves the Wiggles and their music. Right now her favourite songs from this dvd are ""Bump-A-Deedle"" and ""Blow Up Your Balloon (Huff and Huff and Puff)"", from which she also does the dance moves.

The best part of the special features are the Wiggly Bloopers. Great outtakes!

As it was mentioned in a previous review, this was Greg's last recorded performance as a Wiggle. He's especially energetic in ""Shakin' Like a Leafy Tree"" & ""Everybody Dance"" - you cannot tell he's ill at all. It's bittersweet to watch, but definitely well worth the investment (we'll miss you, Greg!).

*Edited to add (4/19) - Contrary to what one reviewer has stated, The Wiggles are not Barney-esque AT ALL. Ugh, even just the thought of it...*shudder*",1174694400,10,841,4.786206896551724
2703037,5,B000LC4Z94,This is by far the best Wiggles DVD.  It is 90 minutes and is full of new songs as well as some traditional songs.  My daughter is a huge Wiggles fan and she loved it.,1174176000,,167,3.742857142857143

8161111,5,B000LC4Z94,we watch this 4 or 5 times a day in my house. makes the kids happy...,1454630400,,69,3.375
8161112,5,B000LC4Z94,Both my girls love the Wiggles. I don't mind listening to the music. Doesnt drive me crazy. Find my self dancing and singing along.,1431648000,,131,4.5
8161113,5,B000LC4Z94,"After the sheer disappointment that was ""Sailing Around The World"", The Wiggles kept saving money by making cheap remakes (Here Comes The Big Red Car, Wiggle Around The Clock, Splish Splash, Big Red Boat), and an extra dvd available only for Americans (Wiggledancing: LIVE In The U.S.A.), people had to realize that they were building up to something big. And when I say big, I mean Top of the Tots, BIG! This is really one of their best, and definately my favorite, for many reasons:

1. The songs are really well written, with my personal favorite being ""Teddy Bear's Big Day Out"".

2. The scenery is lovely, with shots of Sydney & all of the plants highliting the beauty of nature.

3. The story flows through with the skits, as Murray, Anthony, Greg, Jeff, and all the wiggly friends try to reach the end of the rainbow.

4. Larissa Wright as Magdelena the Mermaid? YES!

But just because it's 90% good doesn't mean there's no 10% bad:

1. The Friendly Pirate Crew, while their acting has improved since ""Sailing Around The World"", They are still too bubbly for my standards. They aren't in there for that long though, so the less of them, the better.

2. This was Greg's last video until Surfer Jeff, so that made me sad a bit, but at least he went with a bang.

Overall, if you want a classic Wiggles DVD on the shelf, this is a must have for fans.",1415836800,,1354,4.4534412955465585
8161114,5,B000LC4Z94,These are movies for my son . He Loves them all and watches them all the time . Very Nice,1395532800,,89,3.5
8161115,5,B000LC4Z94,Our son loves these guys and this was another hit for the Wiggles. Always fun and great songs to boot.,1358985600,,102,4.15
8161116,5,B000LC4Z94,This is also a very good Wiggles for the kids to watch.  They all loved it!  I bought this one too.,1357516800,,99,3.6666666666666665
8161117,5,B000LC4Z94,"Since my grandkids came along, we have become Wiggles fans.  This video is one of MANY we have and it keeps them entertained. We have so much fun watching them sing and dance with the Wiggles.  Very cute.",1331856000,,204,4.342105263157895
8161118,5,B000LC4Z94,"Seriously, after watching this DVD at least a dozen times I still don't get the story.  That being said, this is by far my kids favorite Wiggles DVD.  They love to sing and dance to the songs and between tracks the short story sequences give them a short break to wind down and laugh.

We used to watch it on Netflix but one day it disappeared.  When I got the DVD I immediately got two hugs and two thank-you-daddys.

If your kids are Wiggles fans then I suggest this DVD more than any others.",1303171200,,494,4.212765957446808
