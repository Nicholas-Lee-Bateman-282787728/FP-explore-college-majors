Where can I upgrade this most excellent series which had great music with superb British commentary on DVD.  My VHS copies while watching the series on TV in the late 1980's are really cool.  The only series worth commenting on.  Anything of the 1990's and current are highly suspect to me for both quality and content, and especially any acting; what happened?  I want the original series released onto DVD, where is it????",1401408000,6,502,4.790697674418604
8493121,2,B00652U6NI,"I was Interested in purchasing this DVD after watching a small portion of the A-1 Skyraider episode on youtube. Since there really is slim to none in the way of DVDs covering the A-1 I figured I would give it a shot.

After watching a few episodes I realized that the format was typical and very lackluster and almost annoying at times with the camera effects flashing back and forth. The host Paul Moga seems very fake and scripted when talking with the other cast.
  A lot of the footage is recycled and becomes very annoying when you keep watching the same footage over and over. The production value of this film is pretty bad.

I would have given it 3 stars if it were not for some very damning historical inaccuracies where the host is appears to be oblivious to what he is talking about.

I would recommend this to someone under the age of 16",1354924800,4,849,4.382165605095541
8493122,2,B00652U6NI,"While I don't have access to the Military Channel. I saw a preview of the ""Great Planes"" series on the Zune marketplace and it looked interesting. The basic gist is that it covers the history of certain aircraft in the United State's arsenal. I looked for a DVD of the show and at the time the only one that was available was a older disc that covered mostly fighter aircraft, which I'm not as much of a fan of personally.  Since the newer season I saw included mostly bombers such as the B-1 and transports such as the C-130 I was hoping that this disc would include them.  Sadly they don't, it's just a newer version of the DVD I described earlier.  Which is fine if you wanted the programs about the Fighter planes but that's the least of the problems.

The video quality isn't the greatest either, in fact it's horrendous. I wasn't expecting high definition on this disc but when the disc is played on a computer and, I'm just suspecting on this, a flat screen TV the picture is extremely small and looks like it was compressed.  By that I mean if you play a DVD on a computer, it will be in standard definition on the computer screen. However, the media player programs such as VLC would expand the picture to cover the full media player area.  Here it doesn't and in full-screen it is extremely blurry and any text on the screen is virtually unreadable.  I could understand if it was just the vintage footage that looked bad since it was made before high-definition existed but even the new footage where the host talks with people who worked on the planes looked bad.

So programs are fine but the visual aspect is what kills it.  As such I can't recommend it at all.",1348876800,6,1674,4.409090909090909
