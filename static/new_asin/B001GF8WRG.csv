3610972,5,B001GF8WRG,"I am beggining to appreciate the Vehicle Force as much as the Lion Force.
These have different characteristics. There is no magic in the storyline but more military strength the robeasts don't make much noise, and it is fitting that in this series the Emperor is never seen. Also this Voltron has more steel cold cutlery than hot arsen. Possibly more powerful. I, like alot of Voltron fans ignored them when they first came out. I thought., How could they do this?! What happened to the Lions?! , but it grew on me, and Commander Hawkins eventually became my favorite character. Immediately recognized his voice used as Optimus Prime's. Commander Hazar of the Drule Empire just earned my respect. In episode 96 ""Hazar is Demoted"" made me cry a little. So did episode 20 ""Pidge's Home Planet"" as The Lion Force watched it explode.  Most of the time I don't watch any cartoon episodes twice for atleast a year. After Volume VIII is released I just might make that exception for the lack of attention I gave it in the 80s. The coolest parts are when Voltron's Head slowly opens from silhouette to face profile,when Voltron surges out of the ocean, and when he uses spinning lazer blades.

3610979,5,B001GF8WRG,Love the set it's to bad that the vehicle Voltron did not receive the same treatment as the lions with the tin case. Other than that nice set!,1381622400,,142,4.107142857142857
3610980,4,B001GF8WRG,"The later volumes of this series were taken from the Japanese show  Armored Fleet Dairugger XV and made up a Voltron series lovingly referred to as Vehicle Voltron (or Voltron of the Near Universe). While not the same show I remember from the original run, which was the Lion Force Voltron (or Voltron of the Far Universe), my daughter loves the action nonetheless.",1377907200,3,365,4.7936507936507935

3610984,3,B001GF8WRG,The episodes are fine but the case is cheap cardboard and the discs vibrate in a PS3. This show was based on Dairugger.,1359763200,,119,4.217391304347826
3610985,5,B001GF8WRG,"This was my favorite cartoon back in the day so i had to get these when I saw them on sale.  The cases are nice and well constructed, the quality of the DVD is great on my 61"" TV and I can now watch good ole Voltron whenever I want!",1356480000,2,232,3.64

3610987,3,B001GF8WRG,"Voltron Volume 7 is a three-disc DVD set that includes eighteen episodes of the Vehicle Voltron series.  The first disc contains six episodes and a bonus feature.  The second disc contains six episodes, and the third disc contains six episodes and trailers.

On the first disc, the bonus feature is a preview of the eleventh episode of Dairugger XV (""A Momentary Truce"").  On the one hand, it was a good feature to include when the set first came out, since it served as a preview for the Dairugger XV box sets that were going to be released at a later date.  However, now that Dairugger XV has been released, the feature becomes a waste if you purchase the first Dairugger XV box set.  The only bonus feature on the third disc is a set of trailers.  The trailers included on the disc are for: Alteil, Berserk Remaster, Punie Chan, and Dokoro Chan.

Personally, I was very disappointed by the relative lack of special features included in this set.  I think that too many special features were included in the first set for Vehicle Voltron, and that those special features should have been spread out between the three DVD box sets released for Vehicle Voltron.

When it comes to the episodes on this set, it becomes very obvious as you watch it that no attempt was made in the English dub to come anywhere close to what was actually happening in the original Japanese version.  Also, when watching the episodes in the proper order (since they originally aired in a very jumbled order in first-run syndication), there are a lot of inconsistencies between episodes, which causes the viewer to become very confused (and, in the case of the character of Hazar, the viewer can get the impression that he can't make up his mind whether or not he wants war or peace).

Personally, I would only recommend this box set to die-hard fans of Vehicle Voltron who want to own the entire series on DVD.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD set that my husband and I purchased.",1280793600,,1980,4.590909090909091
3610988,5,B001GF8WRG,"Voltron vehicle is the best mecha anime show , I like the storyline and how the development of the story takes form ,like voltron assemble almost in the end of the episode to defeat the invinsible robeast.

The boxset comes with 3 dvds , a booklet of description of every episode in full color.
In dvd 1 comes with a original japenese episode of voltron vehicles.

If you want to know what happens next, buy volume 8  to watch the conclusion of this masterpiece mecha anime.

3610989,5,B001GF8WRG,"As it brings the Land, Sea and Air team together from 15 vehicles to one Voltron.  With each team having their own expertise and skill sets that are advatagous to certain types of terrain.  All the characters in the series also bring their own personalities and quirks to it as well.  It's a great show and i really look forward to picking the next volume - 8 in the series as well.",1253232000,,382,4.277777777777778
