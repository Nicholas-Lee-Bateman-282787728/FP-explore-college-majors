3555038,5,B001EI5C5U,"Move over Kung Pow! Out of the way MST3K! Hard Gun will forever have a revered place in my exclusive selection of LMAO DVD's. It's gangsta. It's Keystone Cops. The English overdubs are exquisitely awful in all the best ways. I almost wet myself laughing during the playground fight scene.

There are some really great one liners in here. If you are to own only one piece of obscure Asian cinema, it would have to be this or Battle Warrior.",1232582400,,439,4.4875
3555039,1,B001EI5C5U,too anyone who's a fan of tony jaa i'm afraid you will b very very disappointed with this movie.after watching jaa in ong bak & the protector i was anticipating more of the same but no cigar.the story line what story line the action what action if this was jaa's first movie it would probably b his last not worth the disc it's burnt on.,1232496000,4,337,4.2
3555040,1,B001EI5C5U,I can't believe they actually packaged this as a blue ray disk being the fidelity of the movie was so poor it was laughable. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. This movie doesn't even rate one star. Don't waste your money.,1231718400,6,237,4.288888888888889

8298229,2,B001EI5C5U,"I would have to say, unfortunately this is one of his movies that i did not like at all. Probably one of Tony Jaa's first. I prefer his newer films like The Protector and ONG-BAK:The Thai Warrior(2005) which happen to have better story lines,acting and visual effects.",1254355200,,268,4.723404255319149
8298230,1,B001EI5C5U,"This is the worst action movie on BD as I have had ever watched.  Although the pictures are clear, bright, but not as impressive as BD can provide.  The sound as 2.0 surround is miserable, does not make the movie exciting any more.  However, for entertaining, it is quite acceptable.",1242432000,,283,4.62
8298231,2,B001EI5C5U,"This film ia about 8 years old,not an up to date release.
 The print is watchable, sharpness is excellent,though there are some badly shot Interiors.
but the film is filled with negative and print scratches,TOWARDS THE END OF REELS. It's then ok for about 17min of each reel.

 Having said that the film is quite good
  I quite enjoyed it, there is a terrific fight at the end with Tony Jaa
who plays one of the bad guys ,and he is in the film about 30min tops.
The rest of the cast are OK.
 Recomended to Tony Jaa fans.,one of his early appearencs.

Navarre who put this out should be congratulated for releaseing this warts and all
They are also putting out 2 Shaw Brothers films with Restored prints,done in Hong Kong by Celestial Films.
great ,Can't wait.",1233792000,,759,4.456521739130435
8298232,2,B001EI5C5U,"Don't let this new release fool you.  If you're not careful, you may think it's a new release of recent work.  It's a new release in the U.S. of an old Thai ""B Movie.""  Tony Jaa has some decent performance as a villain in this movie.  But he is not the main character, and his performance was not all that great.  This was definitely not the ""Ong-Bak"" stuff.

If you are a Tony Jaa fan and for some historical reason, you have the curiosity to see how he started his career, then this may be worth getting for your knowledge.

If you are one of those people who used to like the ""cheesy"" kung fu movies of the past (and I mean the real cheesy ones), then this may satisfy you.  It has ridiculous comedy to the point of stupidity.  I admit there are people who just love ""B"" movies.  This could be a classic for you.

For most of you, this is low-production and pretty bad.  I hope I could make you expect such a bad film that if you are still inclined to get it, you might just say ""Ah it wasn't that bad.""  But it really is ""Cheesy""!  By the way, I speak fluent Thai, and this movie was still dubbed in Thai if you choose the Thai language option.  Wasn't even the voice of the characters.

I would give it a one star, but for the Tony Jaa fan factor, I'll give it a generous ""two.""",1232841600,10,1283,4.072
8298233,1,B001EI5C5U,"Be warned, the video on this blu-ray disc is shot extremely poorly.  The grain at times is so heavy and the lighting so poor it looks like it was shot on a cell phone.  The cover makes this look like a slickly produced movie.  Tony Jaa is barely in the movie.  The first reviewer must have never watched this blu-ray.  I watched about 20 minutes of this and thought it was so poorly shot I am wasting my time.  I would request a refund but the disc itself is not defective.

Buy at your own risk.",1232668800,8,496,4.104166666666667
