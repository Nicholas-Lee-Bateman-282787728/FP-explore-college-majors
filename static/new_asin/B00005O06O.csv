If I had the money, I would madly run after all his work and assemble my basement (i.e., if I had one) with his work. Anyone who doesn't enjoy his movies, his plays or his books, I have nothing but the deepest sympathies. The man is  genius, genius, genius.
If you have money to spend on a good, funny stuff, spend it on this. I know when I leave school and get a job, I will.",1036368000,5,512,4.171717171717172

1638204,5,B00005O06O,"The Woody Allen Collection 3 gathers together six of Mr. Allen's films from the 80's.  They are amongst the strongest films of his career and they feature his best work with one time wife Mia Farrow.  The set features their first film together, the goofy farce, 1981's A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy as well their best film together, 1986's Hannah & Her Sisters.  The latter film very well might be Mr. Allen's greatest triumph.  He effortlessly weaves together the story of three sisters (Ms. Farrow, Barbara Hershey & Dianne Wiest) that involves a love triangle and Mr. Allen's brush with death that has him searching for religion among numerous hilarious plotlines.  Mr. Allen won the Oscar for Best Screenplay and Ms. Wiest & Michael Caine took home Best Supporting Oscars.  Zelig is a hilarious mockumentary that involves a man who has no identity of his own, so he morphs into the type of people he is around.  It intercuts grainy black and white footage with color shots of experts taking about the famous Zelig.  It is something of a forerunner to Forrest Gump as Zelig is seen in historical footage with numerous famous people.  1987's Radio Days is a fond look back at Mr. Allen's childhood while The Purple Rose Of Cairo has the novel idea of a Depression era woman (Ms. Farrow) who has a character from a movie (Jeff Daniels), breaks the fourth wall and comes off the screen into her life.  Broadway Danny Rose is one of Mr. Allen's best acting jobs as he plays a talent agent.",1004918400,,1489,4.670498084291188
1638205,5,B00005O06O,"As many of you know, this is the 3rd box set of Woody Allen features to be released on DVD in the past couple of years.
For my money, it represents the beginning of Woody's most imaginative period as a filmmaker. In fact, the 6 films represented here could arguably be called Woody's finest work.
Sophisticated, yet hilariously funny, the plots and dialogue, as well as the peformances, can be viewed again and again without ever becoming stale. (So sue me, I'm a lifelong Woody Allen fan)
Yes, there no are extras save theatrical trailers, but at this price, who cares? Obviously, Woody isn't interested in producing featurettes, etc. and anyway, these films stand on their own as quality adult entertainment. My favorite among this bunch (and this really is a hard call) has to be Hannah and Her Sisters; Woody portrays a crazy hypochondriac who finds out that there may REALLY be something wrong with him. His character in A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy is equally funny, an oddball inventor around the turn of the century. Having not actually seen the DVDs, I can't comment on audio/video quality, but if they're anything like the first two box sets, they should be superb. By the way, all of these films will be available separately when the box set is released. A must-buy for all serious Woody Allen fans!",1001980800,2,1312,4.758771929824562
1638206,5,B00005O06O,"Let me give a quick rundown on my thoughts on each of these films...
Broadway Danny Rose: The best thing in this good film is Mia Farrow's atypical performance. Her character brassy and loud as opposed to her usual meek or passive aggressive. It's a great change of pace. The film, on the whole, is a bit slight, but it's a good deal of fun. Woody plays the most loyal talent agent ever. Everything in it works and adds to the humor. The black and white cinematography is great.
Hannah and Her Sisters: This is one of Woody's top five films. It's one of his less serious epics as well. Every character in the film feels so much more alive, original, and worthy of our compassion than we see in the average American film. The film stretches over two years of the lives of an extended family, beginning and ending at Thanksgiving dinner. The film is comprised of many small vignettes and all of them work excellently on their own while adding to the whole. The film is wise and funny. Woody himself plays a minor role, allowing his other actors to shine.
A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy: A well shot, but exceptionally minor film in Woody's ourve. The film seems a bit overrefined, and it never seems to take off as much as some of Woody's other films. Everything in the film is low-key... to the point where it becomes slight and slightly uninvolving.
The Purple Rose of Cairo: This is one of Woody Allen's most wonderful films. It's a simple story that takes the conceit of Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr. and runs with it. Mia Farrow plays a woman in the depression-era that wanders into a film and literally catches the eye of one of the actors on screen. He leaves the screen and enters the real world. The film deals with the reaction of both the real world (the actor that plays him confronts Farrow's character, her abusive husband is angered) and the world of the cinema (the other characters can't complete the scene without him). The film is exceptionally cinematic, and words (at least my words) don't do enough to justify why you should see this film now.
Radio Days: Another episodic film by Allen, this time showing the years of his radio-fuelled childhood imagination. The film's filled with a great period detail as well as a great deal of comedy. There's no strong narrative stringing the pieces together, and maybe that's just as well. Every scene works on its own, but you might want a bit more when it's over.
Zelig: An exceptional film that shows Woody at his most creative, Zelig is a mock documentary set in the 1920's that shows that exploits of a chameleon man and the girl that loved him. The film has a lot to say about celebrity and about a sense of self, but it never is less than clever or funny. It's immensely entertaining and a true original.
The problems that I have with these boxed sets is mostly that a director like Allen's best works are spread across several of them. This is the third set already, and there's no sign of some of his best films (i.e. Husbands & Wives, Everyone Says I Love You). One hopes this will be remedied, but I would say only a few of these films (Zelig, Hannah & Her Sisters, Purple Rose of Cairo) are essential unless you're, like me, an Allen completist.",1001203200,2,3216,4.518010291595197
1638207,5,B00005O06O,"Not only is this an essential addition to the previous 2 box sets it also brings us back 5 movies that have been long Out of Print, and it also marks the first time ANY of these films have come to DVD..(Hopefully they will fork up a few extras this time.. :-)This is not as good a selection of films as the first box set, but it certainly tops the second box!! i'm a bit confused with the way they have assembled these last 2 boxes.. the first box was fine, and had 8 great films, many of which were amoung his best.. But the second box (which contained a few of his best with a few of his average films) was only 5 films, i know they grouped them together because they were mostly ALL serious films, But now we get the third box of 6 films of a completely mixed nature.. i know they should be in the order in which they were made, but why not just release 8 at a time if thats how you start off? if MGM would only join forces with all the other studios they could give us a fourth box set, and also fill the gaps with a fifth box set..!! or they could just re-assemble them, and re-release 3new box sets with maybe 10 each..with close to 30 or so films under his directorial belt alone, Woody is more capable of assembling the most interesting boxes as a whole than any other director alive or dead... (not that his films are better, but as a whole they fit in best together, and provide the most interesting structure.. especially since he himself stars in most of them) and What about (at least) an EXTRA documentary disc like they did for ""Stanley Kubrick"", or ""Oliver Stone""??i'm glad woody is getting the dvd treatment in boxes with respect he deserves, And especially happy to see these 5 great OOP films back in the market, BUT there is enough material left over for at least 2 more boxes like this.. i hope they get around to finishing it off.. And when are Universal/Dreamworks/WB/Paramount/ and Columbia Ever going to release ""Special Edition 'Steven Spielberg' box sets""?? i would also kill to have a ""Special Coen Brothers Box Set"".. or a ""Collectors 'Martin Scorsese' Box""or an ""Ultimate 'Zucker Brothers', 'Sergio Leone', 'Tim Burton', 'FF Coppola', 'Polanski', Fellini', 'Bertolucci','Bergman', 'Alan Parker',or 'Special Charles Chaplin' Box ??? and what about a 'Garry Marshall' Box?? j/k ;-)These Studios need to get off their butts, and meet the supply for our demands!! its about time.. :-)",998870400,3,2410,4.529816513761468
1638208,5,B00005O06O,"Well, after the lukewarm and definately standoffish reception of the 2nd Woody Allen Collection (which contained five of his most serious movies), the pressure was apparently on to release the 3rd, and final, remaining set of his films. These are some of Mr. Allen's very finest works, including two of my personal favorites, ""Zelig"" and ""Broadway Danny Rose."" ... Most of these films are considered classics and almost all of them are usually sited as Woody Allen at his very best. The only exception may be that of ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy."" His first film with .. Mia Farrow, this was also only his second period film after the 19th-century Russian ""Love And Death"" ..., but one that was a portent of the many to come ...  Woody had always considered making a comedy of manners and so, after a year off following the lackluster ... release of ""Stardust Memories,"" this came out. However, it turned out that this was an even bigger bomb than ""Stardust Memories"" (one of my favorites, incidentally), and still remains one of his two biggest financial disasters.... The film does have it's merits ..., but, on the whole, it is usually ignored by even some of Woody's most adamant fans. And so, when these finally make it to the shelves, all of Woody's films but ""Husbands And Wives"" will be available on DVD. ...",998524800,4,1319,4.734782608695652

1638220,5,B00005O06O,"While perhaps this 'middle' collection of Woody Allen's films is a tiny touch more inconsistent than the first, it's still a great deal, with - to my thinking - 2 flat out great films, a few very good ones, and only one slightly weaker.  At well under $10 a title (and often on sale for more like $6-7 a title) that pretty remarkable for a collection of important films by one of our best filmmakers.  My individual thoughts, in chronological order  (note: my ratings are based on a 4 star system);

A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982) *** The earliest, and for me, the weakest of the group, though far from 'bad'.  A cute and charming romp.  A group of friends in the early 20th century get caught up in a weekend of love and sex in the country. Certainly enjoyable, if not really much more. Gordon Willis's photography is nowhere near as amazing as his earlier collaborations with Woody, and the film doesn't have any wildly funny moments. But the writing is witty, and the acting solid if not triumphant. It just doesn't feel like a Woody Allen film somehow. More like a nice, solid, unassuming French farce. That's not a bad thing, and this film is still better than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood, with a sweeter, more upbeat tone than usual for Allen.  It's just coming on the heels of masterpieces like 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan', and 'Stardust Memories', and just before other great films like 'Zelig' 'Hannah and Her Sisters', and 'Purple Rose of Cairo', it can't help but pale a bit in comparison.

Zelig (1983)**** Amazing technically, with a lot to say about society, conformity, and how we see ourselves.  This brilliantly made mock documentary about a 'human chameleon' in the 1920s and 30s who unconsciously changes his appearance in a desperate attempt to fit in and be liked, is hilarious and  heartbreaking, often at the same time.  Some of the visual effects are still astounding by modern standards. And Allen gives a performance that is surprisingly subtle.  There are a few slow moments, and a few jokes feel self-conscious, but not enough to hurt the film in any way. This is tied with 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Hannah and her Sisters' for my 2nd favorite Allen film behind 'Annie Hall'.  One of the greatest films by one the great filmmakers of the 2nd half of the 20th century. Very worth seeking out.

Broadway Danny Rose (1984)***1/4 A sweet, fun, well-told, Damon Runionesque fable of a well meaning if pathetic theatrical manager getting caught up with the mob. Not quite as amazing as Allen's very best films, but there's a touching, gentle, funny humanity that runs through it all.  Mia Farrow gives what is arguably the strongest performance of her career -- she certainly stretches way beyond her usual image -- to play a tough, gum chewing mafia gun mol. It's also interesting to see Woody play a bit more of a 'character' than usual. The film has some lovely black and white images, even if its not as striking as the greatest of the Gordon Wills/Allen collaborations like 'Manhattan'.  A good-hearted film that will make you smile more than laugh out loud, it's well-worth seeing if you have any fondness for Allen's work.

The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)***1/2 An utterly sweet, inventive and charming film that examines our love affair with the movies and our need to escape into fantasy. The central device of the wall breaking down between the characters in a film and those watching is great fun, and both Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels do some of their very best work in this. That said, for me, it lacks a little of the depth and complexity of my very favorite of Allen's film. It's a little too cute and simplistic in the middle, although the first and last third, and the uncompromised ending are terrific. It doesn't quite hold up on multiple viewings
the way 'Annie Hall', or 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' or 'Hannah and Her Sisters' or 'Zelig' do. But even 2nd tier Woody Allen is better than almost anything else out there. And on a certain level, with great filmmakers its about personal taste, not right and wrong. (e.g. Is Chaplin's 'Modern Times' better than 'City Lights' ?) So, if you like Allen's work at all and you've never seen this, you owe yourself a look to decide for yourself.

Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)**** A wonderful mix of moving and funny, thought provoking and silly. There's amazing acting all around from the first rate ensemble cast including Diane Wiest, Michael Caine (both of whom deservedly won Oscars), Max Von Sydow, Allen, Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey etc. (Mild spoiler) It features a rare movie happy ending that's actually earned!  This is probably the closest to Annie Hall of all Woody Allen films in the mix of wit, technical proficiency, sophisticated style, acting, emotion, etc. He takes a bevy of characters and creates a complex heartfelt portrait of family, lovers, friends, and artists that's funny but with insightful bite.  A rare film that acknowledges how wonderful life is, without denying how hard it can be at the same time. Or at least how hard we find ways to make it.

Radio Days (1987) ***1/4 A beautifully looking film, both in its production design by the great theater designer Santo Loquasto, and the wonderful photography by Carlo Di Palma, in his first of several fruitful collaborations with Allen. Together with Allen's witty, tender script, and a host of wonderful performances, the film does a terrific job of creating an intentionally larger than life, and slightly surreal memory piece of short stories about growing up in an age when radio was still the king of entertainment.  It's a small, sweet. charming piece. Some of the stories are flat out great, some occasionally feel a bit meandering or pointless, but none are truly weak. The best moments rival Felliini's `Amarcord'. Perhaps not among Allen's greatest films, but still better than the vast majority of what has gotten produced in America in recent years.",1277596800,,5940,4.797257590597454
1638221,5,B00005O06O,"Has there ever been a more prolific film director than Woody Allen (at least, in the post-studio system era)? He has only missed a handful of the last thirty  years (2004, 1991, 1981), producing his low-budget dramas like clockwork.  Allen's persona has become such a comic caricature these days (and it usually was one to begin with; Allen is his own best impersonation), but, when asked, he can in his prime be a very strng actor, and he is surrounded in these films by a reliable cast of professionals.  ""The Woody Allen Collection"", one of three really excellent box-sets of his films available here, in this case covers the period from 1982 to 1987.  Some spoilers follow.

In the set itself, the films are ordered alphabetically for some reason, rather than in chronological order, which makes more sense (the order being as follows):

""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"" - easily the least-famous of the six films collected here, this one is most notable for being the first collaboration bewteen Allen and Mia Farrow, his off-screen partner who would be a feature of more or less all his work (including all five of the other films in this collection) until their rather spectacular breakup in 1992.

""Zelig"" - one of the quirkier entries in Allen's filmography, this is an imitation documentary about a man named Leonard Zelig, a supposed 1920s pop culture figure who was a ""human chameleon"" who takes on the characteristics of the people around him.  Making use of innovative special effects twelve years before ""Forrest Gump"" to put Zelig into old newsreel footage and photos, it's a clever piece, if not especially emotionally involving.  This is one of a number of films in Allen's filmography with sci-fi/fantasy content, but because of his minimalist (magical realist, one might say) approach, he's largely avoided being classified as a genre director.

""Broadway Danny Rose"" - filmed in black and white, this is another of Allen's quasi-autobiographical films, drawing on his time as a comedian and participant in the New York entertainment circuit.  Danny Rose (Allen), is a talent agent responsible for the most obscure acts; his lastest attempt at a big break is a washed up lounge singer he has rehabilitated, but there's a catch: the singer wants his mistress Tina (Farrow) present for his make-or-break performance.  Thus begins a comic odyssey, as poor Danny finds himself the sights of the mob.  It's a decent comedy most of the way through (with one of Allen's most empathetic performances), elevated by the final act, an expert mix of sadness and gentle uplift (including a masterful final tracking shot) that is among Allen's best work.

""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" - another of Allen's genre efforts, in which an abused Depression-era housewife (Farrow) is stunned when a character from her favourite movie (Jeff Daniels) walks off the screen to sweep her off her feet.  Allen evinces no real interest in the genre's mechanics, instead running with the scenario with low-key absurdism (the studio and actor are both concerned about liability issues regarding the now-living fictional character).  Then there's the ending, a deliberately downbeat punch that drives home the movie's examination of the difference between fiction and the real world.  This is one of Farrow's best performances, in the eminently pitiable role of Cecilia; Jeff Daniels pulls off an excellent double-role as both character and actor.

""Hannah and her Sisters"" - one of Allen's most acclaimed movies (it earned him his third Oscar, for the screenplay, as well as acting awards for Dianne Wiest and Michael Caine), this is a relationship drama (as well as a mild existential one) revolving around three sisters living in New York.  Populated with many familiar faces (including, in minor roles, the voice of Marge Simpson, and a young Julia Louis-Dreyfus), this ends up being much more upbeat than ""Purple Rose"", the film preceding it, both about life and the power of entertainment.  This is warm and humanistic, though at points the narration by the various characters can be a bit too direct.  Possibly my favourite film of the set.

""Radio Days"" - the final film in the collection, and likewise fairly upbeat, this is a largely plotless nostalgia tour through scenes from Allen's youth.  There are fairly well-drawn characters, appealing in a variety of vignettes relating to the significance of radio in their lives (even if often only as background music).  My personal favourite sequence involves a would-be radio employee played by Mia Farrow, who survives getting taken for a ride by a mob hitman who turns out to be from her old neighbourhood.  The cast is populated by a grab-bag of actors from past Woody Allen movies (Danny Aiello and Jeff Daniels among them, as well as the three actresses most associated with Allen's films:  Farrow, Dianne Wiest, and, in a cameo, Diane Keaton).  This is a likeable minor work in Allen's canon.

Overall, an excellent deal for film fans.",1267142400,,4985,5.024301336573512

1638223,5,B00005O06O,"""Hannah"" is a grand film, one of the best in years, a film which stands up after some twenty years. The acting is magnificent, beginning with Michael Caine , of course, but there isn't a weak moment in the entire picture. One grand slam would be enough of anybody, but this collection includes another minor masterpiece, ""Purple Rose."" This one is deep and moving, as well as being cute and fun. One element of Allen's genius is his love of silliness, a painful talent to possess, according to Allen, who evidently prefers the dark side. Still, there is that Groucho Marx-quality in him and it is shown well here, where actors hop on and off the screen, and shock us with their sweet innocence. Farrow takes steps here that will mature into one of the great film persona of the decade. She has it all, and Allen had the genius to see it.",1189814400,,837,4.477124183006536

1638225,5,B00005O06O,"This Woody Allen collection of six (6) early to middle films is more homogeneous than the first. You do not have the very serious `Interiors' sitting between two of Allen's funniest movies. But, there are some bumps along the road if you start watching this from the top and are not familiar with Allen's works. The titles in this set are:

A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy

Zelig

Broadway Danny Rose

The Purple Rose of Cairo

Hannah and Her Sisters

Radio Days

The first and the last films are pretty lighthearted. The middle films have a fair share of bittersweet moments. In fact, I put `The Purple Rose of Cairo' into that rare class of movies such as Terry Gillian's `Brazil' which are so good at being poignant that they are literally hard to watch. Even the rampant parody, `Zelig' has some moments when you are really strongly influenced by the plight of the main character.

Although I suspect `A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy' may be the weakest of these six, it is the one I most enjoy rewatching. And, this is the one feature of Allen's movies I most highly value. I will enjoy a James Bond action flick once, but I will watch `Hannah and Her Sisters' over and over and over.

One of the most interesting things about `Radio Days' is that it came out in the same year as the very similar film of `Brighton Beach Memoirs'. And, as I recall, the critical opinion was that `Radio Days' was far superior. I agree.

Strongly recommended for both old and new Woody Allen fans.",1114905600,25,1482,4.537593984962406

Too bad Woody messed up later on, but this period of his life allowed him to make many pleasant comfortable movies that stand the test of time.  Hannah and Her Sisters stands up with Annie Hall and Manhattan.  The film is one of his best works ever.  There was a reason to like Woody Allen in ""the old days"".  It only sad that he goofed up later in his life.  I always saw him as needing his friends at United Artists and Orion to keep him on track, maybe it was true.",1109116800,4,580,4.0

1638228,5,B00005O06O,"This edition of the Woody Allen Collection is probably the best of the three box sets recently issued by MGM DVD.  While Woody is probably best known for his early-70s slapstick comedies (""Sleeper,"" ""Bananas"") and his revolutionary reconstruction of the comedy with ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan,"" three of his absolute best films appear in this set.  ""Zelig,"" whose technological advances foreshadow those of 1994's Academy Award favorite ""Forrest Gump"" by nearly ten years, is easily the better film, and the three years Woody spent making this film seems well worth the effort.  About a ""human chameleon,"" Leonard Zelig, whose insecure shapeshifting act ranges from pure novelty to affinities with fascism, is as funny as it is sharp.  The best film in the set, ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" also foreshadows the postmodern nostalgia films of the late 1990s, particularly ""Pleasantville.""  Set during the Depression, this film is about a woman trapped in an awful marriage and an equally dissatisfying job.  She escapes the misery of her life by watching films.  She watches the same film over and over, and one of the characters comes off the screen to intervene in her life.  A wonderful, complex and poignant examination of the conflation between fiction and reality, ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" though a sad and dramatic film, is as powerful as anything Woody Allen has directed.  The third wonderful film here is ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" which won three Oscars, is a return to the ensemble sensibility Woody perfected in ""Manhattan.""  ""Broadway Danny Rose"" is probably the best of the remaining titles--about a hardworking theatrical manager who is failure at his work specifically because he cares so much about the personal wellbeing of his clients.  Mia Farrow gives one of her best performances here.  ""Radio Days"" is a narratively complex film about a Jewish family from Rockaway in the 40s whose lives are informed and entertained by the radio (just as we are entertained by the television and the internet today).  The one weak film in the set is ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,"" which is very similar to the much better Ingmar Bergman film ""Smiles of a Summer Night.""  It involves three couples together in the country one weekend who all seem to be paired with the wrong lover.
