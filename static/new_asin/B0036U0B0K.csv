4079092,5,B0036U0B0K,"In the mid to late 70's, Jackie Gleason revived The Honeymooners in a series of specials with Audrey Meadows as Alice, Art Carney as Ed Norton, and Jane Kean as Trixie.  This special proves that the intervening years had done nothing to diminish the chemistry between Jackie and Audrey, or between Jackie and Art.  Gleason assumes the role of Ralph Kramden as if he'd never left it, and manages to keep the franchise alive and contemporary (for its time) with a few topical references, yet retaining the flavor of the original Honeymooners sketches of the 1950's.  Once again, Ralph suspects that Alice is pregnant.  Never mind the fact that their ages by the late 70's tend to stretch the plausibility of this premise...with Ralph and Alice, anything seems possible, including their timelessness and agelessness. This is a pleasant, hilarious revival of a comedy classic, sure to appeal to those old enough to remember the originals as well as those so young that this is all new stuff.  This is a fun, funny show!!!",1275436800,2,1017,4.855491329479769
4079093,4,B0036U0B0K,"This being the first of four Honeymooners reunion specials. It's great to see our old friends again, but I do wish that Joyce Randolph would have been here as Trixie. The overall story isn't bad, but some of it seems reused from the past. While Gleason & Carney still have their magic, it's great to see Audry Meadows back as Alice. The price is just right for these specials. You can't go wrong.",1275350400,2,396,4.438356164383562
4079094,3,B0036U0B0K,"I've always been a big fan of the Honeymooners. I am very happy that MPI is releasing these specials now that they have finished the 1960s color Honeymooners musicals. It is a treat to see Jackie Gleason, Art Carson and Audrey Meadows together again, particuarly Audrey Meadows. Jane Kean is a fine Trixie but I would have really enjoyed seeing Joyce Randolf again. Anyway, these specials were made in the early 70s and it's obvious that the cast has grown a little older. The jokes and storylines seemed to mostly be coming from some older ""lost episode"" storylines since at the time nobody thought they'd ever be rebroadcast again or put on something called a DVD. So the 70s audience would probably not remember that many of the things in this story had been done before. Anyway, it was still great to see the cast. The only problem is that I do think it's expensive to purchase just this one DVD that only has a 50 minute show. I will continue to purchase all of these specials but I wish they could have just put all four of them together in one collection for a decent price rather than separating them. And the ""bonus"" material wasn't really worth watching at all. So I give it 3 stars.",1275004800,7,1193,4.502304147465438
4079115,5,B0036U0B0K,"My favorite sitcom television show of all time and I wasn't even born when the classic episodes were filmed. I actually caught the re-runs many years later on ch 11. The sheer talent of the cast, the writing, the delivery, all worked then and still works today. That's just genius. Loved the second honeymoon and although the cast was older and a little slower, the magic was always there. Baby, they were the greatest....",1395100800,,422,4.716216216216216

4079117,4,B0036U0B0K,"This is one of three DVD releases of the ""Honeymooners"" shows that were aired long after the show (and the Gleason show) ended. What happened to the fourth is anyone's guess. Guess we'll wait and see.

It's very funny. Not up to the standards, but when the standards are so high, can you really expect that? It IS very funny! If, like me, you love the 39 or even the musical shows, you'll love this. You'll be very happy with your purchase.

I guess the only negative is the fact that it's one 50 minute TV episode. They could have put all three (or four!) on one disc pretty easily. But, Noooooooooo! But, it's still funnier than anything you'll see in a two-hour comedy today. Just pony up and buy it. You'll laugh, I promise.",1388620800,,728,4.385185185185185

4079119,5,B0036U0B0K,"A fun comedy with a bit of nostalgia. Enjoyed seeing Ralph, Alice, Ed and a new Trixie.  Although the original cast has aged, Alice
looks great and Ed looks nearly the same as he did in the original series!  He never changes!  Alice's mother arrived with the usual sassiness and making for more fun!  There were some familiar bits as people change as they age, but the character of a person still has the same peculiarities!  Looking forward to the other 2 Honeymooners DVD's that we bought. We have all the original
""Honeymooners' Episodes and it was so nice to find 3 we had never seen before!  Thanks, Amazon.com!  Emmy",1374019200,,622,4.6

4079124,5,B0036U0B0K,"Despite what the blurbs say about four TV specials and all in 1976,there were only three that I know of and they are this one,The Second Honeymoon,telecast on Feb./76,the second a Christmas Special broadcast in Dec/77 and the last,The Valentines Special broadcast in Feb/78.
Like the others that would follow,The Second Honeymoon was broadcast not from Miami Beach,Fla. but from Miami at Gusman Hall and for ABC not CBS.It was the US's Bi-Centennial and it was also the 25th anniversary of the Honeymooners which was a perfect time for the Great One to return to the airwaves.
Back in their seats are Art Carney as Norton,Audrey Meadows as Alice,Jane Kean as Trixie and of course Jackie as Ralph;and it is like they never left the airwaves. Ralph discovers some knitted mitts and a cover for his bowling ball that Alice has tried to hide as gifts for their anniversary,but which he mistakes as baby clothing that she is knitting for someone or other. When Mrs. Manicotti's boy drops buy with news for Alice that a rabbit has died,he puts two and two together to get three and thinks Alice is pregnant. A rabbit really HAS died but not the kind Ralph thinks...of course. Throughout there are the usual miscues as Ralph's ideas take on a life of their own. During all this the Raccoon lodge high exalted ruler has offered to marry them in a grand ceremony and send them off for a 2nd honeymoon to the Raccoon National Cemetery in Bismarck,North Dakota;on the European Plan. After the ceremony Ralph gets embarrassed in front of his fellow members when Alice reveals she is not pregnant. Back home he apologizes but Alice comes back with""...but there's no reason we still can't try"".As Ralph turns around to head for the boudoir,with Alice in tow,he confronts his mother in law...face to face. Alice forgot she had invited her to stay. But in the end all is forgiven and they embrace.
This show was a huge success in the ratings which is why ABC invited Gleason back for two more sequels. As I said the cast look like they never had left the series at all. Meadows is a welcome return in her role as Alice and Kean plays her part in a much more relaxed and pleasing way than during her hiatus opposite Sheila Macrae. Carney of course is as always the Laurel to Ralph's Hardy,and both have an uncanny chemistry seldom equaled on television or in film.
This DVD runs at 50 minutes and UNFORTUNATELY excludes the opening Gleason monologue and closing goodbyes. But it does include an interesting bonus feature. It is a TV clip from The Hollywood Palace show of Jan. 7/67. It is Ray Bolger(the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz)and Audrey Meadows playing The Honeymooners in a role reversal. Interesting to see but nothing more.
This DVD The Second Honeymoon,is an absolute delight and will more than satisfy all fans of the Great One and the Honeymooners. It is a must have. The big question is will MPI release the Christmas Special?I think they will...around Christmas this year,but let's wait and see.",1280102400,12,2996,4.719465648854962

The story plot was set up around ralph and alice getting remarried at the raccoon lodge. Ralph thought alice was going to have a baby. But she was not really pregnant. Norton demonstrated to ralph how to change a baby diaper. I know that i wouldn't have wanted them men changing my daughter's diaper when she was a baby. They had the doll covered in baby powder.
