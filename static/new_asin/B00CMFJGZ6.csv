My niece loves the DVD and repeats the words while watching. She smiles and laughs and is really learning about Italy. So am I. And I've never been there! I recommend this product for anyone interested in teaching their children about Italy and learning a few words in Italian. Bravo Ciao Bambolini.",1367884800,5,427,4.863013698630137
