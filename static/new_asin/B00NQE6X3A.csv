6676677,4,B00NQE6X3A,"A cynical and hard-edged detective story, A Walk Among the Tombstones is a solidly muscular mystery and suspense film anchored by an actor, Liam Neeson, in his element and in fine form.  The film opens in the early 1990s, and he is an alcoholic policeman who chases and shoots a group of hoods after they rob his local bar.  One bullet goes astray, and the resulting tragedy inspires him to leave the force and join Alcoholics Anonymous.  A couple years later, he is an unlicensed private detective hired by a wealthy drug dealer (Dan Stevens, anxious and mustachioed and decidedly non-posh) to find the sadists who abducted his wife and murdered her despite his paying the large ransom.  This is an ideal role for Neeson as he continues to enjoy his blazing and unexpected second wind as a 60-plus action star.  It utilizes his established strengthshis imposing build, his deep and rich voice, his convincing air of world-hardened exhaustionwhile also placing him in a context with more ethical complexity and grit than a lighter picture such as Non-Stop provided.

This is the second film directed by Scott Frank, whose prestigious writing credits include Get Shorty, Out of Sight, and Minority Report.  It is not as original nor as resonant as his masterful debut behind the camera, The Lookout, but he still proves a more-than-capable craftsman, turning the suspense dial toward ten with admirable patience (the trajectory of the storyline is not a revelation, but it is also not overly predictable) and conjuring evocative images of shadow-enshrouded, rain-swept urban isolation.  In fact, the film shares a cinematographer with the Paul Thomas Anderson film The Master, and the foreboding imagesof characters descending steep stairways, of alley beatings, and, yes, of nocturnal jaunts in cemeterieshave a depth, level of detail, and texture not always found in multiplex-ready genre films.",1411257600,,1896,5.173202614379085
6676678,4,B00NQE6X3A,"It's 1991. An alcoholic cop walks into a bar for his morning coffee and shot of booze. Thugs come in and shoot the bartender. The cop chases the thugs down the street in a running gun battle, killing two and wounding the third...

It's 1999. Former cop Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) scratches out a living as a private investigator while trying to stay off the booze. One of his AA mates, a drug-addicted veteran and would-be artist, asks for help for his brother, whose wife is missing. Turns out the brother is a drug trafficker, the wife is already dead, and the killers are still out there. Delivering ransom to the killers in a creepy cemetery to save the next victim might just be the easy part...

""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" starts out as another Film Noir-ish Liam Neeson action thriller. But this movie has a bit more to offer. Neeson turns in a solid performance, backed by a good supporting cast that features Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey) as a sympathetic drug trafficker and a couple of really vicious bad guys. The plot keeps throwing out one-off twists, and there is an interesting AA theme threaded through the story. The movie's slow delivery takes full advantage of the New York City setting with some meditative camera work. This might be a formula movie, but the delivery is good and the suspense is great. Recommended as good entertainment.",1411171200,69,1359,4.705882352941177

_________________________________________________________

In a crime drama directed by Scott Frank, we follow ex-undercover cop Matt Scudder as he tries to repair his life. One night, a fellow on the streets approaches him seeking help for his brother to find the man who killed his wife. When Scudder discovers the unlikeliest of help by a young boy living on the streets, they embark on a long journey that descends into darkness with the psychotic killers on the loose. Its only a matter of time before they strike again and Matt must race to find out who these people are and ultimately what limits they're willing to break.

The film stars Liam Neeson, whos known for such roles in the Taken series. While the trailer comes off as a crime thriller and something weve seen before time and time again, your impressed by how creepy and good the film is after it ends. Liam Neeson has never disappointed in a film where his acting begins to show signs of fatigue. Hes at his A-game in A Walk Among The Tombstones and you get that vibe off the Taken films as he roams the streets searching for the bad guys who are responsible for the deaths of many people. Neesons character of Matt comes across T.J. (Brian Astro Bradley) who is a smart kid who wants to be a cop just like that of Matt. Their chemistry works brilliantly with their individual street slangs making there for a bit of comedy-relief with everything thats going on.

What was interesting as the film took its time to develop the background behind the bad guys was how little you know of them by the time your introduced to them head on. From the beginning you think its a gang that goes after those who are rich or are after drugs. One of the most gruesome scenes in the film came when Matt went to speak with Danny (Maurice Compt) whos wife was killed by the men. When telling his story there is a scene where he approaches his car and proceeds to open his trunk and discovers a bunch of small bags after being told he would find his wife after paying the kidnappers ransom. This set the stage for  how psychotic and crazy these men really are and that they don't follow the typical rules like most criminals do.

From the locations to a technical standpoint, A Walk Among The Tombstones was a great film with Liam Neeson as the lead star. It felt gritty and almost gets under your skin as these psychopaths drive around town searching for their next victim. The chemistry between Matt and T.J. worked really really well to my surprise and just comes to show how amazing Neeson can adapt to different actors and can make them shine in the process. The film also delves into Matts history of alcoholism and his quest to staying clean after an accident that involved three gunmen at a bar thats shown in the trailer. The psychological component of being able to forgive oneself while searching for psychopaths brought an atmospheric feeling of dread.

I attended the film with a friend that by the end he would say Liam Neesons performance in the movie was better then that in Taken. It may be due to the pacing of the film or the grittiness that brought out Neeson with his personal demons. Regardless, Id definitely say to check out the film cause youll have a fun time. It does have its unpleasant moments of terror and takes its time before getting into the swing of things, but shouldnt sway anyone from watching it.",1411171200,5,3439,4.5476575121163165

Plus, I could have done without the reading of the 12-step program for alcoholics that was interspersed with the action at the end of the movie.  I like Liam Neeson, but this movie is not very original (which makes me wonder why he agreed to do it).  A movie can be dark and violent and still be good.

Thought I'd prefer Denzel Washington's turn in the latter but have ended up favoring this one. I like the period piece nature of it (late 90s) and the fact that it's based on a detective fiction series.

One thing Neeson nails is the repentant alcoholic and his commitment to integrity and, as much as possible, internal peace even though (natch) his work makes all three of those difficult. It's hard ot find something new in the ""guy who goes to AA and tries to live/move on"" but LN does.

If you want to see Liam kick butt, there is one good scene at the beginning.  After that there is minimal butt kicking and that which occurs at the end is mixed in with gruesome knife and cleaver stuff.  Just a little to dark and over the top with the violence.  Don't get me wrong.  I love violence like you see in Taken, but this is violence committed by sadistic sexual predators.  Seems like Liam could have found something better to do.  Also, the roof top scene might be the most predictable scene ever.

6676733,5,B00NQE6X3A,"From the Lawrence Block mystery. It was real fun to watch Liam Neeson - as usual. What amazed me was how extraordinary the other main actors were. And a there is a great kid actor.
I thought Boyd Holbrook and Dan Stevens, playing two brothers, were fantastic. The young Dan Stevens may remind you of Johnny Dep or Jared Leto who take their acting to WHOLE other levels. Plus as it happens there is wonderful instruction to anyone wanting to repair their lives. This was handled so professionally!
Seeing one of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder mysteries come off the page into a new dimension - that's fun.",1480032000,,603,4.644859813084112
6676734,5,B00NQE6X3A,"I should preface this review by admitting I'm a big Lawrence Block fan.  The top shelf in my library, all 72 inches of it, contains paper copies of all his novels and stories.  I've read all of them at least three or four times and plan to continue turning those pages. So when I learned Universal was releasing a DVD of Block's A Walk Among The Tombstones I was both thrilled and wary.  The first movie made from Block's books, Whoopi Goldberg's Burglar was, in my view, a fun movie and a good Whoopi vehicle, but it was not good Lawrence Block.  So I was apprehensive.  I imagined Bruce Willis (at his darkest, as in Last Man Standing) doing a credible job of bringing Matt Scudder to the screen, but couldn't think of anyone else that would be up to the job.  Then I learned it was Liam Neeson, and my hopes got an uplift.  He could pull it off.  He did pull it off.  Boy did he pull it off!  He got Matt Scudder like he was wearing his skin.  And beyond that, the rest of the cast and crew measured up as well.  T.J. was ""close enough"" in my view.  I mean, they met on The Deuce, not in a library and that difference is reflected in the way they handled his character in the movie.  But that's a minor issue, and does not detract from the fact this movie is nicely representative of the Block original.

I'm not going to say anything about the plot, don't want to spoil it for you.  But I will say this: if you like the movie, head for your nearest bookstore and check out Matt Scudder in print.  If you start with the first book of the series, In The Midst of Death, and work your way up to Tombstones, (the 11th by my count), you'll have a  greater appreciation for the character as Mr. Neeson so ably portrayed him here.",1479513600,12,1727,4.181818181818182

As a reformed alcoholic who regularly attends AA meetings Matt is introduced to Howie (Eric Nelsen), the brother of high level drug dealer. Howie takes him to see his brother Kenny (Dan Stevens).

It is part of Neeson's retirement plan to make as many flicks like Taken 1 which was okay but has been mimicked ad nauseam with 2 and 3.  He grimaces and growls through the grind of a plot that needed rethinking long before and much more than it needed a title.  Acting has been replaced by reciting lines that are cliches.

I enjoy the way Scott Frank directs. This is a slow burner, so if you suffer from ADD I advice you to pass. If you enjoy old detective novels then sit back and enjoy.

If you enjoy this movie, then you will definitely enjoy another movie from this director. Go look up ""The Lookout.""

Along the way he finds and befriends a teenager who assists him in this assignment, though he almost walks away from it, despite the huge payday offered to him. With his own ghosts haunting him he must find out if he can rise to the occasion. Not as much action as in many of his flicks but still quite enjoyable.

There are so many incredible and powerful scenes that I was blown away!  This film delves into some very frightening concepts.  Liam Neeson has floored me by his degree of skill, dedication and physicality.  He is totally believable in this role (as always) and quickly has the viewer invested and cheering for his well-being. (I have seen most of his work and am close to deciding that THIS ONE IS HIS BEST!!)

 I have a brother whose philosophy is, ""If a movie doesn't grab me within 10 minutes, I'm asleep."" Lol. :-)  While watching, ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"", I pressed ""pause"" and called him on the telephone.  My statement to him was, ""Have I got a movie for you!""  This is no exaggeration, once you press ""play"", literally 60 seconds later, ""Boom""!!  The movie jumps off and the thrills, chills and suspense never stop!  You will be on the edge of your seat, at times in disbelief and totally engrossed by the story, action and drama.  In closing, if you like suspense, action and/or Liam Neeson -- get this film.  You will not be disappointed.",1440115200,,1224,4.627906976744186

6676941,3,B00NQE6X3A,"It bothers me that I gave ""The Counselor"" only two stars and give three to ""A Walk among the Tombstones"" when it seems clear that the former is a much more thoughtful and multifaceted piece of work.  But I didn't like it, and this much more modest, predictable movie seems better of its rather ordinary kind than the hyper-intellectualised kind that ""The Counselor"" belongs to.  All that said, ""A Walk"" is not a great movie by any standards -- we have the familiar ex-cop-and-recovering-alcoholic-turned-PI, and the fact that Liam Neeson takes the part and lavishes his solid professionalism on it keeps us watching.  It seems that the wives and daughters of drug dealers are being singled out for kidnapping, mutilation, and murder, and Kenny Kristo, the husband of one of the victims (Dan Stevens, playing sullenly against type) hires Matt Scudder (Neeson) to find out the perpetrators, with an eye to taking his revenge on them.  The police are out of the question because Kenny is a drug trafficker (NOT a mere dealer, he wants Scudder to know).  Meanwhile Matt is attending AA meetings and coming to terms with the circumstances that caused him to leave the NYPD and also forming a relationship with TJ (the appealing Brian Bradley), a black homeless teenager who seems to hang out in libraries and has read a whole lot of crime fiction.  Suffice it to say here that he's instrumental in resolving the case and that his moment of triumph comes when Scudder introduces him to Kenny and others as ""my associate.""  The others include Kenny's brother Peter (Boyd Holbrook) who is fighting a gallant losing battle with his addiction, and Yuri Landau (Sebastian Roche), a drug-dealing acquaintance of Kenny's, whose young teenaged daughter is kidnapped late in the movie.  The stakes for the audience are now higher, because a child is in danger -- director and screenwriter Scott Frank is clearly pushing our buttons here.  The suspense throughout involves our awareness of the strategies and targets of the kidnappers, and their van always appears cued by ominous music.

The tombstones of the title refer to a cemetery in which the body parts of one victim were scattered and which figure again late in the movie.  I'll avoid spoilers and just say that much, though not all of the procedural work that Scudder does is plausibly presented, though the part involving Jonas (Olafur Olafsson) I found not convincing -- and that's a weakness since it does point Scudder in the direction of the perps.  The tombstones might also be Scudder's now-dead past that he can't quite get away from.  The ending will strike viewers as meeting the requirements of rough justice, but the last narrative section seems clumsily handled to me.  On the plus side, we see Neeson here as credibly human and sympathetic and not the implausible superman of the exploitive ""Taken"" series.  Be thankful for that, and enjoy the moments of creepiness.",1439424000,,2924,4.9266802443991855

6676989,4,B00NQE6X3A,"A Walk Among the Tombstones is more a psychological thriller than anything.  This is a slow moving movie that builds anticipation as it goes.  Liam Neeson stars as Matt, a played out police officer who has been asked by an AA buddy to help out said buddy's brother.

Two, possibly three men, have been kidnapping family members of drug dealers to hold for random.  However, these kidnappers are not returning the taken in pristine, mess less good, condition.

Matt, while researching a woman's death, meets a young black kid in the library named TJ.  TJ helps Matt catch up to the 20th Century by researching the internet for him.  The two become intertwined in the investigation.

6676995,4,B00NQE6X3A,"Based on a Lawrence Block book, A Walk Among the Tombstones stars Liam Neeson as Matthew Scudder, a private detective and recovering alcoholic. One day Matt is asked by a drug trafficker Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens), whose wife was kidnapped and brutally murdered, to find the kidnappers for him. At first Matt declines, but later changes his mind, and starts to investigate the crime.

Dont expect something like Taken here. A Walk Among the Tombstones is written and directed by Scott Frank, who was Oscar-nominated for his screenplay for Out of Sight. Like in the George Clooney crime drama, small details and character traits are sometimes more interesting than the storyline in A Walk Among the Tombstones.

Not surprisingly, the best thing in A Walk Among the Tombstones is Liam Neeson, whose character itself is a sort of mystery to be solved. The story of a street kid TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) serves as a subplot, and his interaction with the gloomy private eye is pretty amusing to see.

Mysteries (including the past of the former police detective told in flashbacks) are not really intriguing, though what happens to some of the characters is often horrible. A Walk Among the Tombstones is a stylish, modern-day film noir with less twists and more violence, and works as such.",1435190400,,1288,4.926267281105991

6676997,5,B00NQE6X3A,"(basic outline of the plot)
The film has mixed reviews which having just watched it surprises me a little.........
'Matt Scudder' (Liam Neeson) used to be a 'Cop' he also had a drink habit, now, he's an unlicensed private-detective.
He is asked to speak to 'Danny Ortiz' (Maurice Compte) a drug-dealer, who's wife had been taken supposedly for
ransom, he had paid what he could lay his hands on, his wife .....dead.
'Matt' realizes who 'Danny' is and rejects the case, however after being given the torrid details of how 'Danny's' wife had
been returned in pieces packed into small plastic bags, 'Matt' changes his mind.
As he starts his investigations he gets a little on-going help from young T.J (Astro) 'Matt' soon discovers that similar cases
had happened earlier.
The people he's looking for are sick and ruthless, the area 'Matt's' investigations are taking him to are almost no-go zones
for the regular Police, the targets appear to be partners of known drug-dealers.
When 14 year old 'Lucia'(Danielle Rose Russell) a relative of 'Danny' is taken and a Million-Dollar ransom is demanded,the
stakes are raised, 'Matt' has to lure the culprits into a trap, by insisting that 'Lucia' has to be swapped alive for the cash, the
clock is ticking
This is a classy drama in which 'Liam Neeson' excels in the role of the troubled Private-Eye.
The film does have some graphic violence and scenes of brutality, and plenty of tense moments......worth a viewing.

I like Liam Neeson when he plays action figures. I felt that he played Scudder very well. The director portrayed the tale in a way that caught my interest and held it throughout the entire film.

6677013,5,B00NQE6X3A,"There are some films that are so grisly that they are difficult to watch. A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES is the cinematic adaptation (by director Scott Frank) of Lawrence Blocks novel by the same name. Yes, it is an R rated for strong violence, disturbing images, language and brief nudity  not mentioning the dismemberment of human bodies  but the actors are so excellent and the directors sense of pacing and of what to show and what to suggest that the overall impression the film leaves is one of horror  but brilliance.

Matt Scudder Liam Neeson) is a former cop now a private eye. He is asked by drug dealer Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens, impressive in an American role) and his brother Peter (Boyd Holbrook) to find the men who kidnapped his wife. It seems like they killed her even after he paid them $400,000. (they had asked for 1 million). Scudder refuses. But the man later goes to see him and tells him the brutal manner of his wife was killed. Scudder takes the job. He does some research and thinks the men he is looking for have done this more than once. And that everyone they grabbed is connected to a drug dealer. He was about to give up when they grab another girl and Scudder tries to make sure she's returned alive. The sociopathic kidnappers are played with surety by David Harbour and Adam David Thomson. Their accomplice is the fine actor lafur Darri lafsson who plays Jonas  in a very significant role. Matt befriends a street kid TJ (Astro aka Brian Bradley  a very talented youngster) who brings out Matts sense of humanity. The supporting cast is extraordinarily fine  never has the underbelly of New York smelled so foul.

The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. at all times matches the tenor of the film as does the music scoring by Carlos Rafael Rivera. B tin the end the reason the film works so well is due to the uncanny acting by Liam Neeson  right on target in a very rough role. It make take a strong stomach to watch, but for those who admire fine cinema, don't miss this overlooked film. Grady Harp, June 15",1434240000,2,2043,4.529891304347826
6677014,5,B00NQE6X3A,this movie was a bit different for Liam Neeson but still not too bad for a movie.it was a good movie and at a pretty good price too,1434240000,,131,3.7142857142857144
6677015,5,B00NQE6X3A,"""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" is great! This is how the story goes: Private investigator Matthew Scudder is hired by a drug kingpin to find out who kidnapped and murdered his wife.

The cast led by Liam Neeson (solid as usual as Matt Scudder) is great. The directing & screenplay (based on the novel by Lawrence Block) by Scott Frank is great.

The music by Carlos Rafael Rivera is great. The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. is great. The film editing by Jill Savitt is great. The casting by Avy Kaufman is great. The production design by David Brisbin is great. The art direction by Jonathan Arkin is great. The set decoration by Cherish M. Hale, set dressings by Candice Cardasis, Patrick Woods, Matt Macdonald, Jeffrey S. Rollins, Hank Liebeskind, Valerie Scoppa-Misarti & Jamie Squillare is great. The costume design by Betsy Heimann is great. The special effects supervised by Jeff Brink & coordinated by Kevin Zack is great. The visual effects supervised by Luke DiTommaso & Chris Healer is great. The stunts coordinated by Mark Vanselow is great. The make-up effects by Craig Lindberg are great.

This is a great action / suspense thriller that is entertaining and well-done. It is also well-crafted and solid, as well, too. Liam Neeson is solid as usual as Matt Scudder and leads a great supporting cast that includes Dan Stevens (also solid as Kenny Kristo). Scott Frank has directed and wrote another great film to his resume. This is (or was) one of the underrated films that came out last year (September, the beginning of the fall season, to be exact).",1434240000,,1571,4.83271375464684

6677052,5,B00NQE6X3A,"I'm always glad to try out films in the vein of Hard-boiled detective stories and Film Noir and I must admit that the over-abundance of various crime dramas and police procedurals have managed to wear me out a bit but A Walk Among the Tombstones was very refreshing. Not just for the examination of procedure but the victims of the events that Matthew Scudder gets involved with.
The characters and events are based on a novel by Lawerence Block who also writes a rather long series of somewhat open-ended books with Scuddder as the primary protagonist. However you don't need to be familiar with either the author or any of the books to enjoy this film (or hate it).
While I don't think that there's anything mind-blowing about the movie I thought that it was very well done, had strong performances (some fairly subdue but still good) from all the actors involved and managed to have a few moments of levity in an otherwise bleak story. The character is flawed enough that he seems real without being so flawed that he's a psychopath detective or drug addled cynic who has taken up crime fighting for... reasons. If you enjoy shows like Jack Taylor or 8mm, I think you may like this.
So if you're looking for something you can simply enjoy on any given evening that isn't so dumb that you run the risk of losing IQ and not so pretentious that you'll immediately become a film snob I'd say give it a try.",1432857600,,1405,4.535433070866142

6677059,4,B00NQE6X3A,"Fairly unknown director, Scott Frank, brings us a well-crafted story that is as deeply engrossing as it is disturbing.  Neeson, who has quickly become typecast as the geriatric action hero, takes a much-needed break from his bigger budget throw downs to deliver a subtly sophisticated and poignantly disciplined performance.  In this venture, he is a haunted and shady private eye which becomes enmeshed in a diabolically evil series of kidnappings and murders among a collective of lesser evils by comparison.  His journey is further complicated by the involuntary camaraderie of a young runaway and aspiring detective.  The acting is authentic and convincing.  The plot, although a bit convoluted, is thoroughly engaging, possessing a unique and effective indie styling.  It is a refreshing thriller that keeps one step ahead of the audience until the bitter end.

The film seems to suffer from poor editing, as the plot leaves a lot of holes, the explanation of which are probably on the cutting room floor. The novel is of a genre known as a ""procedural"" where the way the clues eventually lead to the solution is one of the main attractions. The movie skips over many of the clues and investigating in favor of intuitive leaps by Scudder. Also, they have written out several of the most interesting characters from the book, and turned TJ into a caricature of a street kid.

The reason I give it just 2 stars is that despite the interesting story and excellent acting in the film (the young man with sickle cell was brilliant), the detailed representation of the serial killers was, again, in my opinion, glorifying this type of behavior and I found it disturbing and so very sad.  I don't think Hollywood needs to give any of the actual sick individuals out there any new ideas.  I actually clicked past the scenes that contained the killers actions.

6677230,3,B00NQE6X3A,"I love Liam Neeson and he was good in this.  But, wow, this was hard to watch.  There's kidnapping, torture, murder and well, other terrible stuff done to women in this movie.  I understand this movie is an adaptation of a book, so if the book had all that in it, then then it makes sense for the movie to have it, too.  It just got me physically ill to watch those parts.  Some folks love watching slasher/bloody/gory movies like this, so if that is what you like, you will probably enjoy this movie a lot.  The acting was pretty good and the plot line was interesting.  I should have read more reviews before watching this.  So, my fault.  If I had known more about the movie, I wouldn't have watched it.  Again, the acting was great and Liam Neeson is his usual dark, tall and very handsome tough guy.  I loved to see him looking so scummy in the beginning.",1427500800,,860,4.279503105590062

6677336,3,B00NQE6X3A,"Liam Neeson has become known for the cadre of action movies he has appeared in over the past decade. While this is NOT an action movie, it is still a similar typecast role. I have really liked some of the other stuff writer/director Scott Frank has done (wrote and directed The Lookout, wrote Minority Report), so I decided to give this one a shot.

The aesthetics in the film were very dark and very gritty, which worked perfectly for this late 90's New York City crime drama. However, I feel like the dark and gritty aspect may have been 'taken' a bit too far. *SPOILER* On one side you have the criminals in the movie, who were evil, vile men who did horrible things to women, and on the other side you have a former alcoholic cop who (in his drunkenness) shot and killed a little girl. This makes it hard to root too much for him (unlike Taken's Bryan Mills).

Because the protagonist essentially has no one and nothing, you would kinda be ok if he died at the end of the film. So as it would happen, justice and/or vengeance is achieved at the end of the film, but then the movie ends... and you still feel like something is still wrong.

6677398,4,B00NQE6X3A,"Neeson one fine actor.  However as a 69 old growing up in Brooklyn I found some scenes not of the greatest.  My time on the street as a ghetto street cop gave me many a radio run more dangerous (wounded twice on one of them) along with three hospitalizations prior to this alone in just my last 17 months on the job. The 71 precinct where I worked had multiple and I mean multiple stories that would blow viewers away and I don't mean just mine. Just two issues. After being wounded and having the perpetrator found guilty and sentenced to 15 years to life for ""An Attempted Murder of a Police Officer he was allowed to sue for ""Violation of his Civil Rights"" and a Federal Judge still sitting today (to the best of my knowledge he's in his mid nineties, physically that is) awarded him 22,500 dollars in the year 1982.  This amazement on record with the NYC Comptroller's Office is the ONLY time the aforementioned has taken place it NYC history (This is the screen play.) The 451 page manuscript covers a break thorough in the ""Color Barrier"" circa 1973 when I partnered up with a Black guy (former Academy mate Class of 67-22) to watched over students and teachers alike that were being terrorized by street gangs. Both of these true incidents straight up.  Unfortunately I was never was able to find an editor/agent/publisher that had the courage to bring them to the public. Oh yeah.

6677408,5,B00NQE6X3A,"Liam Neeson was a good choice to play tough, jaded and yet compassionate off-the books private eye Matthew Scudder. A former alcoholic cop until a shootout killed a little girl, Scudder is an unlicensed investigator with little of the tools that official PIs possess, but he has a former lifetime dealing with the scum of New York and he knows his way around some of the seediest of the Big Apple's rotten spots.
  Scudder is an unlikely private dick. He attends AA meetings religiously and spend time in church as well. And takes only the cases that appeal to him. At first, the case of a Yuppie drug kingpin whose wife has been kidnapped and slaughtered doesn't appeal to him. The kingpin and his wife are the kind of people who usually wind up being slaughtered.  But...he makes the mistake of listening to the kingpin tell him how his wife was murdered and he changes his mind.
  This is an old fashioned detective story with no screaming car chases, little overt violence until the end and no unlikely heroics by Neeson. He's just an old cop who's trying to make it and stay sober for one day at a time. The film packs surprises - one of the most startling coming out of nowhere midway through the film - and two of the best villains in any recent cop movie.
  It's good that movies like this are still being made. And it's good that Neeson is apparently in good enough shape that he can keep doing these types of roles until he's well past the age to qualify for social security.",1425427200,,1485,4.4575645756457565

6677450,4,B00NQE6X3A,"The detective story has been a staple of movies for years. Everything from the deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes to the down and dirty Phillip Marlowe have been on display, making the private detective a character that can be either slick or down and dirty. Author Lawrence Block has made a career of writing about one detective in particular, Matthew Scudder. While the character has been around since 1976, only one movie has been made featuring him, 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE. That is until the release this last year of A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES which has just arrived on DVD.

Liam Neeson plays the title character, a police detective when the film begins in 1991 and then a private detective 8 years later shortly thereafter. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic due to scenes we witness in the opening. Peter (Boyd Holbrook), a fellow addict who met Scudder at an AA meeting, shows up one day and asks for his help for his brother Ken (Dan Stevens). Scudder reluctantly agrees.

It turns out that Ken is a high end drug dealer whose wife was kidnapped. When Scudder tells him he doesnt handle kidnapping cases Ken informs him that hes already paid the ransom and that the kidnappers returned his wife in pieces. He wants Scudder to help him find the kidnappers/murderers.

While looking into the case Scudder discovers there have been more cases of victims cut into pieces and dumped around town. As he researches the information at the library he meets T.J. (Astro), a young homeless boy. The pair gradually help one another as T.J. helps Scudder navigate the librarys computer. In return Scudder pays T.J. Eventually this becomes a situation where they pair help one another as the film progresses.

Using clues to track down information about the past murders Scudder comes to realize that they have all been connected. Each of the victims was tied to a drug dealer in one form or another. This prevented those the ransom was demanded of from contacting the police. With each piece of information Scudder gathers the closer he gets to the kidnappers/murderers. But will he turn them over to those whose loved ones were kidnapped knowing full well theyll seek their revenge or will he contact the police?

While these are the basics of the story found in this movie its more about the journey taken by Scudder that is the heart of the film. Scudder has been a rudderless person when we see him in 1999. He lives but isn't alive. The combination of helping the families of the victims and his own helping of T.J. bring him back to the real world, one he gets involved in rather than merely walks through.

The movie and the performances reflect the gritty streets that exists as opposed to the glamorous cityscapes seen in most detective movies these days. Scudder is no slick hustler with a quick $20 in his pocket dealt out to tons of connections. He is instead a diligent investigator who claims its more about luck while delving into the problem at hand. The world he walks in is drab and dirty, more grays, brown and blacks for a color palette than the bright neons were used to seeing. This is the truth of what the occupation offers instead of the glitz most movies offer. In the end it helps rather than hurts the film.

Neeson does a fine job here, never yelling or doing the acrobatic styles of fighting most films, including his own TAKEN series, offer. He remains calm in most situations and doesnt carry a gun. When he does arm himself its the last thing he does. There is even a section of the film where he warns T.J. about the dangers of walking around armed. With Neesons recent comments on guns in America he still has no problem walking around shooting people when the character calls for it. But the fact is this is a movie and hes entitled to his opinion.
The movie harkens back to some of the detective films of the seventies rather than the typical gumshoe of the thirties and forties. Streets are dirty, killers are despicable and drug dealers live in nice houses but not mansions. As with those films it is the diligence on display by the detective that helps him find the bad guy. In a world overrun with numerous car chases and enough arms to supply a small army its nice to see a return to this kind of detective. Heres hoping we see more of Matt Scudder.",1425168000,2,4291,4.608638743455497

6677575,4,B00NQE6X3A,Liam Nesson delivers another good preformance in a dark suspense triller.  I watched the movie with an open mind and looked at the whole picture not for the slow moments or certain characters.  I also agree with another reviewer that with Nesson preformance even the slower moments of the movie made the movie move forward and watchable.  I also notice based on the roles this actor has chosen as of late makes me feel he is being typecast in his roles.  But back to the actual movie I even watched the behind the scenes of the movie but I see the movie as this main character trying to conqour his demons while saving other people from the downward spiral or fall because of their demons.  So if your looking for a good movie that you can watch all the way threw pick this movie up and see for yourself Liam Nesson is becoming a great action star plus mixture of suspense and trillers.,1424304000,,886,4.411042944785276

6677580,2,B00NQE6X3A,"Liam delivers, but the film fails. That's all I can say about Scott Frank's adaptation of what must be one of Lawrence Block's best Matt Scudder mysteries. And that's a pity. No fault of the actors mind you, they do their best with a script that fails to convey the meat in Block's great story. Block is one of my favourite writers; he shared the stage with the late Bob Parker as America's greatest crime writers - in a class by themselves. And while I agree totally with casting Neeson as Scudder, Frank fails with a dismal interpretation of the story, and directing that is mundane at best. The film simply fails to grip the viewer as it should. The bad guys, despite their horrendous crimes, are given no depth of character by Frank, and seem superfluous at best, and the action, which comes only in spasmodic bursts, is sacrificed to developing the relationship between Leeson & his young protege, which in the end, becomes an unnecessary distraction in the overall story. The result is a film that is long on talk-time & short on action, that the excellent cast are unable to lift above the mediocre. The downside of films like this is that they may put readers off reading the original books on which they are based, & in the case of the Matt Scudder series', that would be unforgivable. Had Scott Frank opted to just direct A Walk Among The Tombstones, & placed the screenplay in more capable hands, the outcome could have been (and probably would have been), much better for all concerned.",1424304000,,1498,4.614232209737827

Fits nicely with those thrillers you watch once and forget about for a few years (kiss the girls, law abiding citizen, Copland, etc). Certainly entertaining for a night of escapism, but it's not going to win any awards, put it that way. Not too memorable.

6677589,3,B00NQE6X3A,"Liam Neeson saves A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES from being a total disaster. Neeson is a talented actor who seems to be stuck in a succession of ""dark"" roles. This fine actor deserves better but he does these roles down to an art.
This time, Neeson is Matt Scudder, a former cop turned unlicensed private investigator with a broken marriage and a dark secret in his past. Let's say there is no surprise in this storyline. Scudder is hired by a drug trafficker (played wonderfully by an unrecognizable Dan Stevens from DOWNTON ABBEY) to get revenge on the men who kidnaped and viciously killed his wife. It's soon clear that a serial killer or killers are at work. Again, nothing new here except that the female victims are the wives or girlfriends of wealthy drug traffickers. A little twist there and ironically, the traffickers all seem like nice guys. Can Scudder save the next potential victim?
Add in the smart and eager street kid that Scudder befriends and who unwittingly helps in the investigation and we definitely have a story that we have seen over and over again. It's a totally predictable and gruesome story that can be unnerving at times. Only Neeson makes A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES slightly above average.",1424217600,,1222,4.768867924528302

What he learns has him realizing that these are not ordinary kidnappers and he will have to delve into the darker side of himself.

The dialog occasionally felt like it had been pulled right out of a novel without nearly enough of the back story you would find in the novel to justify it.

Neeson does a creditable job of playing a angst ridden ex - cop but I expected to be entertained more somehow. For me it was a couple of hours of watching people suffer without any real satisfying ending. I enjoyed the bad guys getting theirs a lot more in the movie ""Law Abiding Citizen"" than this film.

6677723,4,B00NQE6X3A,"THE FILM: Despite having a run-of-the-mill story, A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES has some of best character work that Liam Neeson has done in a long time. In this film Liam Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a former cop turned unlicensed private detective. When a heroin dealer (Dan Stevens) approaches him about investigating his wife's disappearance, he ends up getting a little more than he bargained for. One thing I really liked about this film was the attention it paid to its characters. Matt Scudder was very well-developed, and even the supporting cast were given their due. Other than Matt, my favorite character was a black teenager who kind of ends up being Matt's sidekick. He was very down-to-earth and quite funny at times in a movie that tended to be more downbeat (which is perfectly fine). Even the villains, despite not having as much development, were interesting for their rather nonchalant approach to what they do and, like all of the characters in the movie, had various shades of grey as none of the characters were clear-cut good or bad. Another thing I found interesting, although it didn't add substantially to a deeper interpretation of the film, was that it was set in 1999 (in New York) around the time that Y2K was a big deal. Anxiety about that hangs over the entire film, although I can't say that really added too much. Yes, Matt Scudder is averse to technology (the internet, cell phones, etc), but it still felt like a missed opportunity to comment on a pivotal period in American history. Still despite all of this great supporting detail and several interesting characters, the story is somewhat routine in that it's basically just a private eye tracking down some sadistic criminals. There's also not much flair or originality in the way it's presented or unfolds. What I will say in the story's defense, though, is that the nature of the violence is handled rather tastefully and wasn't overly gratuitous like in some of the recent fare that Liam Neeson has been in. There was sufficient emotional impact to justify what was shown and it served the story beyond just having some action to placate fans who go see Liam Neeson movies for that reason. When all is said and done, though, despite the downbeat tone to the story it's not all depressing. There's a sequence towards the end which includes the 12 Steps from AA (Matt Scudder is a recovering alcoholic) that felt uplifting in a way, and that contrasts nicely with the anxiety and tension derived from the film's setting during the Y2K scare. Overall, I liked the film for being a little more thoughtful than most of the genre films that Liam Neeson has done in the past few years. He seemed right at home in this role, and I look forward to a sequel, should they choose to make one.

THE EXTRAS: The Blu-ray is a little light on special features, with only two short featurettes totaling about 19 minutes. The first one is a behind-the-scenes piece which talks about the journey the story made from book to screen, and a limited look at the production. The other was focused on the character of Matt Scudder and heavily featured the author talking about his creation. While not bad by any means, they certainly could have included a little more supplementary material.

OVERALL: It won't win any points for originality, but Liam Neeson is great as the main character and sells this rather ordinary private dick story. It also doesn't hurt that the film has some tone and style to spare. However, for the viewer who likes a more in-depth view into filmmaking than just the film itself may provide might find themselves disappointed. Still, it's hard not to recommend this film for Liam Neeson's performance alone.",1421884800,2,3700,4.7796875
6677724,5,B00NQE6X3A,"This a very good story, well acted and directed. Both the milieu and the plot are carefully fulfilled. Each scene builds upon the last and all the characters are true to form. Of course, as any good story will supply, we (the viewer/reader) will want more, but isn't that the writer's job, to create characters we care about and plots we want to carry on.? Mr. Frank (director) provided an excellent mix of character and action. The story moved fluidly and forcefully, it is a grand example of true hero-vs-villain even though the villain exists both internal and external to the main protagonist.

The action is meaningful, without being gratuitous. The character exposition is riveting and thoughtful; sometimes it is hard to tell whether the protagonist is the hero or a danger to the plot, but he always moves true to form and provides enough twists to the story.

All in all, it's a compelling plot, well told through the main character's eyes.",1421884800,,949,4.815950920245399

The Silence of th Lambs was less voyeuristic. Neeson is his usual gravelly self, and the more interesting performances come from Dan Steven's drug traffiker (very thin and dissipated here) and Boyd Holbrook as his junkie-trying-to-go-clean brother.

I quit before the actual torture could begin. Why use women only as victims? Why even write a script that salivates over women being used this way?

Then they jump back to the present.  Then they show a blonde woman getting tortured, but she's not the one who was killed in the other flashback.  I'm not sure when the woman was being tortured in the timeline.  Eventually they jump back five years to the restaurant robbery again. The pace was slow and confusing.

In a movie a little different than Neesons last few roles with less action and more drama and mystery, I found Neeson acting as strong as ever in the type of roles he knows how to play well. I did find the formulaic story though a little muddled though and kind of meandering/slow moving at times. I also feel that the kid in the movie felt to me a little out of place and was unnecessary for the storyline. This movie had a kind of Clint Eastwood Bloodwork kind of feel to it. I also thought they could have developed the main characters back story a little better.

Overall, a decent movie to watch but lacking the kind of action like what you would expect in the Taken movies but interesting enough for a rental.

Taken franchise, Unknown, Non-Stop, etc.) What I most like about this film is the plot.  The story looks genuine and realistic. Too bad the director did not focus a bit more on the background of the bad guys, it would have been interesting to know if they really did work for...

6677771,2,B00NQE6X3A,"***(SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.  TINY ONES.  THE MOVIE SPOILS ITSELF, REALLY.)***

The book must have been horrific if it translated into this confused mess of a movie.  This film ruins its own story with foolish anti-gun viewpoints that stop just short of gagging you.  A private eye operating on the EDGE of the law--WITH NO WEAPON!  AND NO FIGHTING SKILLS!  What the . . . hell?  Nancy Drew thrown into the projects with a freshly baked cake and a bag of crack might get out of situations a little better than this guy.

And to make it worse, he preaches against guns.  WHAT!?!  A former cop!?!  One accident in his life turned him off of guns.  You know how many REAL heroes are coming back from Iraq and and other Middle Eastern hell-holes having seen MUCH worse and they still own guns?  Even recommend we all own one?  How stupid is this writer?  How cushioned and sequestered a life this writer must live.  He could have talked to a few cops, soldiers, etc. before writing this character.

A character who dislikes guns and puts himself into situations where A GUN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL HE COULD CARRY!  LOL.  Do boxers get into the ring and close their eyes?  Do MMA fighters get into the octagon and refuse to use their legs?  Do soldiers go into battle with just t-shirts on and Life-Alert buttons?  Do corrections officers carry bouquets of flowers in case things get rough in the prison?

THEN we get a cliched tough guy with a heart of gold helping a SPECIAL poor black kid.  Oh god, how many white people need to save minorities?  You know, minorities are heroes too!  It's not like this black kid was Tyler Perry.  He had skills.  Frankly, the African American kid in this movie would have made a better private eye, and he was someone you'd follow just to see what he does next.  Braver than the main character!  More competent!  That is a storytelling no-no.  Supporting characters SUPPORT.

This kid (T.J.) literally figures out how to finish off the serial killers!  LOL.  That's like cops showing up at a stand-off and a goofy kid skateboards into the middle and says, ""Let me handle this, dudes.""  And the cops shrug and nod.  And take him into battle.  Yes, the main character takes a KID into a fight with serial killers.

Then you have a couple of serial killers who do the most foolish things, like inviting strangers to participate and letting them live.  Yeah, every serial killer we know of trusted his/her identity to a weak pervert stranger.  LOL.  Ludicrous.  To make things worse, these serial killers are somehow connected to a government agency.  Yeah?  How?  Why?  The movie never explains.

THEN the serial killers act totally bonkers in the end.  As if no one on the writing staff knew how to have this terrifying duo remain terrifying, so they asked a bystander at the local Subway how he might end the movie.

The credits roll as fast as your eyes after this movie completes its waste of your time.

6677786,4,B00NQE6X3A,"Coming in the middle of his late career change into an action movie, I guess you could be one of those who walks into A Walk Among the Tombstones thinking you're going to see some action packed revenge thriller with Neeson using his his particular set of skills to bash in the heads of two murderous killers, but would walk away disappointed at the quiet thriller it actually is. I've never read Lawrence Block's Scudder series but I do have an affection for crime movies, and particular love of detective fiction and found myself enjoying a solid outing providing Neeson with one of his better characters.
The worst that could be said for Scott Frank's adaptation of Block's Tombstones is that travels very familiar grounds at times with characters you've seen in various other films of its ilk from the street smart kid with an illness that tags along on the mystery to the drug dealer, or creepy man doing more than raising his pigeons on a rooftop. But Frank thankfully after a running shootout between Scudder and some hoods that sets up a tragic past for the character to relate in his many scenes of AA meetings thankfully creates a mellow thriller, building its mystery components with reveals of the killers and their methods as Scudder quietly walks the streets looking for clues to unravel the mystery behind a slew of kidnappings and murders.
The film is leisurely in its pace that will throw off some viewers expecting the action thriller of the previews but to me its a solid genre effort relying on Neeson's world weary gaze that wants retreat back into his bad habits. I like the constant use of AA meetings where he relates the same details of the shootout that opens the film before he finally admits what made him give up drinking and being a police man. I like Dan Steven's Kenny who with his heroin addicted brother could be a character viewed in a moral grey area of honesty. And Frank who's made of a career of adapting the works of crime writers like Elmore Leonard or James Lee Burke for other directors makes a good impression as director building his characters till the final confrontation in a cemetery cut between Scudder at another of his meetings after the action, as a woman recites the AA creed. The films a solid effort in my opinion held back by the standard trademarks films like these have while giving Neeson a character He feels born to play. I don't know if the film will receive a sequel but its found the perfect actor to embody the role.
Sadly as a fan of the film the blu-ray doesn't offer much outside of two small features exploring the movie, and the Scudder character. Still as a fan of the film the audio and video are at least trade offs for background into the making of the movie. Give it watch with the right expectations and you might be entertained.",1421193600,4,2805,4.589641434262949

As the film adaptation of the 10th book in Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder PI series, this movie is a slow-burn mystery movie. After reading a few of pieces of Block's work before seeing this movie, I realized action is generally not his MO and, thus, I wasn't expecting too much here.

With all that said, this film is a functional mystery/crime drama that almost unfolds like an episode of Law and Order. It's competently acted, shot, and scored, and the story is written in a way that nicely fits pieces together for viewers without beating them over the head too much.

After reading ""Sins of the Fathers"", the first book in the Scudder series, to get ready for this movie, I was somewhat disappointed with the changes in Scudder's character. A lot of Scudder's complexity is lost and, for some reason, he is now a frequenter of AA instead of having bourbon in his coffee.

For the last few years I have been joking (half joking) that every Liam Neeson movie lately is another version of Taken. This is one I can't really even joke about...because it essentially is. He has to find a missing person before it's too late. The main difference is this time the missing person isn't related to him. Also while Taken was exciting with a lot of action this one really seemed to drag. The last half hour was very good but feels more like a reward for sticking through to the end.

The movie begins in 1991, when off duty New York City cop Matt Scudler (Liam Neeson, in a great performance) ends up killing three burglars at a bar. The movie then moves to eight years later, when Scudler has retired (we will learn why much later in the movie) but still works as an unlicensed private detective. He is eating at a down market bar, when a former junkie he has met at an Alcoholic Anonymous meeting comes to see him. He tells him his brother Kenny needs to see him, can he please go. Curious about this, he goes and meets Kenny (Dan Stevens), who turns out to be a drug dealer. Kenny's wife has been kidnapped, the kidnappers warn him not to call the police, and even though he has paid the 400,000 dollar ransom, they still killed her. Kenny asks Scudler to find who the kidnappers were, and he sets out to investigate. (All of this happens in the first ten minutes of the movie, so I'm not giving away the plot).

Curiously set in 1999 (a key shot has the Twin Towers still standing), this solid, slightly overlong noir (the name Sam Spade is referenced at several points during the film), has a solid secondary cast of little known performers.

Be forewarned that this is about as gruesome and dark as it gets, redemption is not so easy to come by. When scum bag drug dealers are the good guys, you know you're in for a rough ride.

Excellent job all round. The pace is perhaps a bit slow, but it suits the sombre mood of the piece. Good for a rainy night when you are feeling very, very cynical.",1420156800,,539,4.213592233009709

With an unwanted sidekick, a broken past of bad memories and a drive to resolve his past with his present. That said it is typical of Neeson films of late. For awhile he played modern gothic mysteries of being cuckolded or challenged by a family member in a tragic sacrificial dance. But recently, after his wife's unforeseen death in real life, he has turned to action adventure Dirty Harry style films with a flair and stoic cognizance not since Clint Eastwood.

6677924,5,B00NQE6X3A,Liam Neeson has found his niche as of late. A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES is devastating. Liam Neeson's performance is more intense than I have ever seen. I love stories where the hero reflects and perhaps is looking for a little redemption and then suddenly he is drawn back into world he just can't seem to escape. You learn from leading a life of worldliness and those tools and skills you gather along the way somehow separate you from the mainstream.,1418169600,2,453,4.604938271604938
6677925,4,B00NQE6X3A,Liam Neeson has his reinvention as a action hero down pat.  This time he plays a ex-cop who now works as a unlicensed private detective doing favors for people in return for gifts.  When a wealthy dope dealer has his wife kidnapped and after he paid the ransom they killed her anyway he wants Neeson to find the two men responsible.  At first he turns the job down because the man is a dope dealer but he changes his mind and starts to look into it.  He finds the men are basically serial killers who are working on drug dealers and pretending to be DEA because they had killed a female DEA agent and took her files on open DEA investigations and that is where they are getting their information.  It is a complex trail that he follows and you learn the facts as he does along the way.  Brutal and grisly this one is not for everyone and a pretty dark tale.  Based on a Lawrence Block book.,1418169600,2,890,4.230769230769231
6677926,4,B00NQE6X3A,"""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" is not an action packed film; it takes time for the story to develop as you watch it. It has a  dark and edgy atmosphere.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't mind the graphic content.",1415318400,3,407,4.561643835616438
6677927,5,B00NQE6X3A,"Very good movie...starting in 1991 and taking you forward to 1999.  It is somewhat similar to ""Taken"" but this time Neeson is a self-retired New York City cop and prior alcoholic, turned private detective.  A drug trafficker ""Kenny"" hires Neeson because Kenny's wife was kidnapped, held for ransom, and killed anyway.  Although reluctant to get involved initially, Neeson gets mixed up with a group of sinister barbaric butchers, while he also befriends a homeless boy and does what Neeson does best....hunts down the bad guys.

Great story.  Keeps you glued to your seat.

Not for the children......violence and killing.",1414281600,3,621,5.222222222222222
6677928,3,B00NQE6X3A,"Lawrence Blocks character Matthew Scudder is just as popular among fans of crime fiction as any character written by James Patterson or John Grisham. I had no idea he existed before walking into A Walk Among the Tombstones, Scott Franks adaptation of the tenth Scudder novel. Thanks to a post-movie Google search, I learned his character is part of a longer story. In theory, the Scudder books would make a fantastic procedural crime drama, like a CSI, or an NCIS. The built-in geriatric audience for both of those shows would eat it up, and fans of the books would surely find stuff to nitpick. I write this review wondering if Tombstones will be successful enough for us to see this character again onscreen. I kind of hope it is.

""Tombstones"" follows Scudder (Liam Neeson,) a retired cop with the darkest of personal demons, who sometimes does ""favors"" for people. A drug dealer informs him that two thugs have kidnapped and murdered his wife, and before too long, we discover she isn't the first damsel in distress these thugs have killed. Scudder embarks on a mission to gather information and go in for the kill.

I figured Tombstones was going to be something like a Taken 3. And after that movie, Neeson became typecast as the older-ish gravel-voiced badass. In the winters Non-Stop, he basically played the same character from the Taken movies. A Walk Among the Tombstones is the darkest Neeson film in recent memory, and he sure isn't playing the character were used to.

Scudder is a rich character, layer after layer revealed with the intention of making him seem more interesting than he may initially, and it more or less works. I wasn't expecting it to be a challenging character for Nissam, but it kind of was. The central problem with Tombstones is its utter lack of powerful female characters. There is not a single female cast member who isn't dead or in constant peril, in need of a man to save her life. It sends a negative message, one that youll only notice after youve left the movie.

However, in the end, Scott Franks film hits more right notes than wrong. Its a moody noir crime drama with a few well-observed characters and a simple plot that is likely to get under your skin and send chills down your spine.

6677929,2,B00NQE6X3A,"There's an adage that is associated with cinema among other forms of media: ""You've seen one, you've seen `em all"". For better or worse, that phrase is pretty accurate for the most part. Whether it's Arnold Schwarzenegger, Will Ferrell, or, god forbid, Michael Bay, you know what you're getting as soon as you walk in the theater. Liam Neeson can also be included on that list, as ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"", his latest film, shows as evidence to that claim.

Based on the Lawrence Block novel of the same name, ""Tombstones"" is an amalgamation of ""No Country For Old Men"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Man on Fire"", minus the subtle psychological and emotional impact, dread, and tension of the former two, as well as the gripping motivation for revenge and resolve of the latter, exaggerations be damned. This is the result of writer/director Scott Frank's indecisive, awkward tonal shifts, ham-fisted writing, and flat, one-dimensional performances with a lackluster climax as an added bonus.

That being said, there are some moments that evoke an ominous, intrusive atmosphere, undeniably credited to the surprisingly exceptional cinematography. The use of shadows, framing, and appropriate editing highly complements the film's more intense moments and makes the anticipation for what happens next almost palpable. Unfortunately, these moments are too few, and are thoroughly wasted by the aforementioned problems that the film suffers from.

Referring to the phrase above, this is another Liam Neeson outing, which is usually not a bad string of words when aligned with the actor. Whether he's punching wolves in the face (The Grey, and no, that isn't hyperbole), saving his daughter from sex traffickers (Taken), saving his daughter AGAIN from sex traffickers (Taken 2), or saving an airplane (Non-Stop), you can always expect an exaggerated, yet somehow subtle, enjoyable performance from Neeson. ""Tombstones"", regrettably, is an exception (see: flat, one-dimensional).

The most damning thing about ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is that it achieves a goal that no film, let alone any form of entertainment, should reach: It's bland. If this film were to be described as an edible substance, it would be like eating a rice cake sandwich made out of cardboard, with a styrofoam salad on the side.

 Alright, that part is somewhat hyperbolic, but you get the idea.

Forgettable, formulaic, and dull, just like an unmarked grave. How ironic.",1414022400,8,2448,5.229591836734694
6677930,4,B00NQE6X3A,"Theatrical review. There may be spoilers.

Liam Neeson, who has been making a living lately playing an action character of one kind or another, makes a slight detour in this grisly modern noir thriller. He's Matt Scudder a former cop who now makes a living as an un-licensed private investigator. As he says, ""I do favors for people and sometimes they give me gifts."" His reason for foregoing the police is pretty well spelled out in the TV trailers, but in the movie, full discloser only comes well into the story.

As a reformed alcoholic who regularly attends AA meetings Matt is introduced to Howie (Eric Nelsen), the brother of high level drug dealer. Howie takes him to see his brother Kenny (Dan Stevens). Kenny wants Matt to track down the kidnappers who took his wife, ultimately torturing and killing her, even after he paid the ransom. While the film is never overly graphic, it does deal with disgusting subject matter as we see a pair of psycho-misfits (Adam David Thompson and David Harbour) torture their prey inside a cargo van.

Director Scott Frank, who also adapted Lawrence Block's novel for the screen, takes his time with plot evolution. While Neeson's character isn't the martial arts master from the ""Taken"" films, he has the same resolve and gritty persona. Matt's unlikely and unwanted ""assistant"" is TJ (Brian `Astro' Bradley), a young street survivor that he eventually takes under his wing. While the film isn't breaking new ground, what it does, it does well. Excellent photography, fine acting (watch for more of Dan Stevens in the future) and an overall excellent film.

6677931,3,B00NQE6X3A,"Don't let people tell you, ""I liked it better the first time when it was called 'Taken'.""  Yes, it is Liam Neeson, and yes he does play another awesome ""take no crap"" role!  But this movie isn't Taken.  I'm not saying that in a bad way, but not in a good way either.  Neeson plays the role of Matt Scudder, a former cop and recovering alcoholic.  He's had a tough past and now keeps himself occupied as an ""unlicensed"" PI.

The problem I had with this movie was not the acting or production or anything of that nature  I just didn't find it that interesting.  They took too much time trying to turn a simple storyline into a complex case.  If they'd have just stuck with the main plot and not attempted to force it in different directions, I think it would have come out much better, but then again, it might not?  I think they should have left out the kid (Brian 'Astro' Bradley) also.  Not that he didn't play a great role.  He was great as the character, it just didn't seem necessary for the plot.  Actually, he got rather annoying as well.  Just seemed like something they decided to throw in for no real reason.

Final Verdict:  Watch it.  While I didn't enjoy it as much as ""Taken"", it WAS better than ""Taken 2"".  So that's something?!",1412553600,8,1242,4.326086956521739

used to seeing Neeson in.

and an interesting plot.
As I said, Neeson is an ex-cop that works as an unofficial private investigator.
He is hired by a blue colar drug dealer to find his wife's killers. And the story
spirals down in some weird things.
It is a slow movie, but I guess movies are sometimes supposed to be that way,
without all the explosions and the gun battles.

A really funny thing is that the movie takes place in 1999. So, some referances are
interesting (the gulf war is the one original one, there is fear for Y2K, etc), which
makes things interesting for us 40+. It is great that the producers did not change the era!

Liam plays the investigator with cool swagger as he navigates the seedy areas of NY to find two maniac serial killers.

6677934,2,B00NQE6X3A,"The film opens up with Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) doing a watered down version of a ""Dirty Harry"" scene. Eight years later in 1999, Matt is no longer a cop, but a private detective and is eight years sober. He is contacted by a man about a case as we soon discover a couple of guys are kidnapping the wives of rich drug traffickers, demanding ransom, and then killing their victims anyway.

Matt is aided by some unlikely characters and follows his 12 step program, which we painfully get to hear, as he goes after the bad guys.

This is an okay me-too ""Dirty Harry"" film, but nothing that great. The characters were not entertaining. The dialogue was bland, especially for us who have had the misfortune to never participate in a 12 step program. What the heck was that all about?

6677935,2,B00NQE6X3A,"Liam Neeson plays yet another grizzled, take-no-guff tough guy in this half-baked crime drama that wastes its hard-earned moodiness on silly storytelling. I'm not taking any points off for Neeson rehashing himself (he's a retired cop and reformed alcoholic named Matt Scudder) because, hey, he does it real well. In fact, he's not asked to do much more than glower in this film.

Currently working as a private eye, Matt gets hired by a big time drug trafficker named Kenny to help find the men who killed his wife after he paid them a lot of money not to. Matt's detective work uncovers the work of two very dangerous and unpredictable psychopaths. Tracking them down and stopping them from killing again turns out to be dark, grisly work. Also, a little boring.

A lot of small changes would make the movie work far better than it does. For instance, virtually none of the characters seem very authentic. Our bad guys work but only because their lack of personalities function the same way as the eyes of the shark in JAWS. Every other person, though, just fails to ring true. Kenny delivers all of his lines like he's trying to eject his eyeballs out of his head by sheer force of will, and when he needs to be sympathetic, he utters random facts apropos of nothing. ""I could've paid more,"" he says as Matt is leaving his house. ""I told them I could only pay 400,000, but I could pay more. It was our nest egg."" Matt, like the audience, has no idea why Kenny is saying this, and just leaves the scene. Just like this, over and over, characters speak in ways that betray their archetypes, saying lines that sound like lines.

Probably the worst offender is the young TJ, a homeless black boy that Matt befriends in a library. TJ is meant to humanize Matt, but this is totally unnecessary, because Matt is already spending the entire film risking his life to find some brutal killers. TJ spouts streetwise cliches and even uses slang improperly (I was certain during the film but I checked the Urban Dictionary just to be sure, and it turns out our scriptwriter doesn't know what a ""chicken head"" actually is) and refuses to put junk like soda into his body. Twizzlers and pancakes for dinner is fine. But no meat. Meat is bad for you. Point being, when TJ shows up, the plot screeches to a halt.

These things should've been chopped out of the script to make more room for places where there are unforgivable shortcuts. Biggest among these is how Matt learns of the identity of one of our villains. ""How did you know I was lying?"" asks the guilty rat. ""Because you're a weirdo,"" Matt growls. Ha ha ha! Hilarious. But seriously, how did you know?

It's stuff like this, including huge symbolic bonks on the head and a constant, in-your-face references to Y2K (most of them via clunky Time Stamp Tribune paper headlines, which also let us know about gun violence) that make the film sometimes feel like it's trying to go for a really subtle kind of satire. Given the rest of the themes -- including mutilation and some pretty egregious child abuse -- that doesn't seem the case, so the whole thing ends up feeling both shoddy and overwrought.

This is most evident in the film's climax, which is paused over and over so that the audience can hear some woman recite the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. The gimmick is so pretentious and so deflates the moment -- one of the few really engaging parts of the movie -- that it makes one wonder what it's even trying to accomplish other than mainlining the film's emotional core directly into your earballs. And that's really the biggest problem with the movie: it doesn't trust you to care about any of the characters, so it resorts to cheap tricks to get you to get emotionally involved rather than letting the plot speak for itself.

But even that might not have been enough because our protagonist, Matt, really has no arc in the film. He's pretty much the same at the beginning as he is at the end, except by the time the credits roll, he has a new friend in TJ. But he hasn't learned anything about caring or alcohol or himself that he (and the audience) didn't already know at the start of the film. This makes TJ's presence even more blatantly a plot device. In this case, he's meant to distract from the fact that although Neeson is playing yet another man with a powerful set of skills, unlike in his past successful films, his character this time around never really develops or grows. His virtues and flaws are nearly identical, meaning he has nothing to gain or lose from anything he does. Neither does the audience, it turns out.",1411603200,16,4593,4.573511543134872

6677937,4,B00NQE6X3A,"A Walk among the Tombstones

A Walk Among the Tombstones caught me by surprise. I expected this to be more or less a continuation of Liam Neeson's two very successful action flicks Taken and Taken 2 which involved a kidnapping. Once again I proved to myself the old saw about assumptions making a you- know-what of you and me. A Walk Among the Tombstones also involves a kidnapping but the resemblance ends there. This looks more like a mystery drama than an action movie. This does not discount the very well choreographed fight scenes but non stop mayhem is not the style of the story telling.
Liam Neeson plays the tough-but psychically bent to the breaking point-off the books private eye, Matt Scudder. An ex-cop (for reasons I will not blab here) with no private investigator's license, Scudder works in the deep shadows. He hasn't had a drink in years, for good reasons. A recurring gag in the film has Scudder speaking at AA meetings, where he comes to the attention of a not quite recovering young junkie (played with horrifying veracity by Dan Stevens). The junkie's brother it seems needs some help from just such a private eye as Scudder, one who is totally off the books. His wife has been snatched in a kidnap for ransom scheme.
All is not what it seems at first, as we might expect in a film based upon a book by mystery writer Lawrence Block. A Walk Among the Tombstones, the novel, is tenth in the 17 novel series penned by Block using the same Matt Scudder character. Block, in addition to producing a staggering number of books, has received four Shamus awards for mystery writing excellence-four so far. He still writes at a prodigious pace.
I should mention a side plot. Scudder runs across a street urchin, maybe 14 or 15, a smart, vulnerable waif out on his own. A young actor named simply Astro plays the teen age PI wanna be with admirable authenticity.
As the detective runs down leads we learn that the kidnappers are not all that interested in money. They like to torture and murder women. Their stock in trade is to prey upon the woman folk of drug lords, who have plenty of ready cash and who cannot very well go to the police.
They never return their victims-not intact anyway.
Director/writer Scott Frank wrote such memorable scripts as Get Shorty, Minority Report, Marley and Me and The Wolverine among others less famous. His writing here give his actors a chance to do and say things that hold our interest. His direction is inconspicuous, which I like more often than not. He garnered only other directing credit so far, for the not successful The Lookout which I will now get from Netflix, if only for comparison.
Among the hopeful producers we find the name of Danny DeVito, the caustic and diminutive comic actor.
This solid three saw blade mystery movie held my attention throughout. The people who hand out the ratings wisely grant A Walk Among the Tombstone a hard R for very icky murders and brief scenes of obviously terrified victims. It lasts one hour and 54 minutes. Danny DeVito and the other producers allowed a reasonably frugal $28 million to make the film. The movie returned $13 million over the three day opening weekend which indicates that the investors may eventually get their money back.
Fans of adult level murder mysteries will like this one. Not for the kiddies at all.",1411344000,3,3331,4.674616695059625
