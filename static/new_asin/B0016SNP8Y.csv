8264186,5,B0016SNP8Y,"My pre-natal yoga was extremely soft and how I thought this practice would bebut the stretches go very deep, deeper than my new mishappened body was used to. But I tried it anyway, on the floor with the air conditioning on full blast. Many of the poses were old friends with new twists on them, to compliment the serpent theme of our practice; the Serpent on the Tree of Life (Vksana) and Cobra (Bhujagsana) are two old favourites. I never once felt hot as our breathing was not the warm, open AUM of firey movements, but a sinewy HSS that was cool and controlled. As a devotee of Hekate, I resonated most with the Medusa pose: a deep squat, tongue out and hair writhing with hands in a prayer position. I couldn't help but feel the power coming up from Brimothe serpent of the Earth rising up and causing my legs to shake, thighs to quiver and eyes to naturally roll until the energy shot out through my third eye. It was very, very intense.

The DVD is very well produced, with an atmosphere of sacred motion that does not seem artificial or forced. The music was soft and something I did not pay much attention to until the second viewing, as the practice was new to me and I focused more on it. A nice fusion of ambience and tech, it didn't overwhelm with volume but complimented the practice. The booklet which came with the DVD was an extra bonus, with beautiful illustrations by Hrana Janto, of Leema in the different poses with the serpent beings superimposed upon herlike a picture taken of her ethreal body as she shapeshifts into these poses, not just doing yoga. The animated chakra feature was an interesting bonus, which I think is especially helpful for women who are new to this kind of deep, internal practice. Another great feature is being able to turn the words off completely during play, so there is only the movement of your own body and the serpentine music. The closed-caption makes it especially accessible for those who are hearing impaired, and like me have a toddler sometimes playing nearby.

I would love to do yoga with this woman in real life some day and feel after a few weeks of doing this practice, several times a week I will be ready for that bicycling machine I have placed below Babalon in my bedroom: because movement through sex, dance and yoga are all ways of allowing that shakti energy, that dormant wild and angry woman inside a place to let it ALL go, safely.",1403913600,,2407,4.518348623853211
8264187,5,B0016SNP8Y,"I am new to yoga so I thought I would stick to a DVD until I could gather up enough courage to try a class. I bought a copy of Snake Yoga at a conference, and I love it! The exercises were geared toward all levels. Over the last week, I have increased my flexibility and range of motion. My energy has also increased dramatically. The meditation is beautiful and artistic. I especially love the music-only feature. I can turn the voice on or off, depending upon my  mood. Le'ema Kathleen Graham does a great job helping me relax, which is no easy feat! I highly recommend it.",1210118400,3,575,4.324074074074074
