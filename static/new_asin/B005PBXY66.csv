8482438,5,B005PBXY66,It is indeed of very few Pakistani movies that one should watch. It highlights the issues that women face in Islamic society as whole. It discusses various aspects on whole religion dominates common sense and what stupid things people do in name of religion.,1367107200,,258,4.886363636363637
8482439,2,B005PBXY66,"I don't know why the other reviewers say this is not an Indian movie. It is sponsored by Eros entertainment and some other BOLLYWOOD movie companies. I initially thought and hoped it was a Pakistani made movie, but I was disappointed to see it was not. The intro thing, like the certificate they always show before a movie, says it's Indian as well. It's a movie made by Indians, about a Pakistani girl and her family. So a lot of the actors are Pakistani. The storyline was good, and it was made in a good way, great actors as well. Definitely not a B-movie. Even though it was late I did not fall asleep. But in my opinion it was a propaganda movie. My husband couldn't even watch it and it made me, as Muslim angry. There is so much wrong information about Islam in this movie. I didn't see anyone practice it correctly. They show gay muslims, transexual muslims, pimp muslims, abusive muslims, prostitute muslims and extreme liberal muslims,  etc etc I think this movie is very offensive to Pakistani people. I know every religion and culture has a mixture of different people and that's okay, but to see all of this in one movie, and no ""normal"" person, is odd.
Also even the girl's father was abusive, uneducated and cruel, BUT he made a lot of good points that were painted as they were negative because of his ridiculous behavior and he couldn't express himself properly. Like none listens to your words if your actions contradict. But the story's purpose was to get the viewer's empathy from Zayneb's point of view so supposedly she was right about the extreme liberal, anti-Islam and disrespectful stuff she said to her father and she was not. It's bringing out negative messages about Islam and about Pakistani culture. If you don't know much about Islam or you're not paying too much attention it's easy to fall for their ""tricks"".

If you don't know much about Islam or Pakistan and you want to learn more, you may not want to watch this movie, because it will give you an entirely wrong impression, and if you do know a lot about Islam you may feel offended. If you can look past all this stuff and not let it affect you, it's not a horribly-made movie. But what good does that do if it's clearly a propaganda movie. Ir really doesn't deserve our dollars.",1337212800,2,2269,4.54523227383863
8482440,5,B005PBXY66,"I agree with Ms. Qureshi, ""Simply a masterpiece! It is a Pakistani Urdu Film which did extremely well at box office in India. Of course, it is not a bollywood/hindi/Indian production, and the credit goes to a bold & creative Pakistani Producer, who also created ""Khuda Ke Liye"".  I urge Amazon to correct its marketing database, and change title to ""Urdu Film/Pakistani production"". Is  media biased to shift credit to India for good productions, and bad episodes to Pakistan, or it is my perception?",1336608000,,500,4.940476190476191
8482441,5,B005PBXY66,The title needs to be changed its not a bollywood/hindi/Indian production but a Pakistani Urdu film very well made addressing many religious & cultural issues in the society. Simply a masterpiece!,1327104000,4,196,5.354838709677419
