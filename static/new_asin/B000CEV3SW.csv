2463137,5,B000CEV3SW,"Midori days is probably one of the most overlooked anime shows lately and thats really a shame cause it was probably the best romantic comedy anime in a long time. It follows the story of Seiji Sawamura and Midori Kasugano, Seiji is a tough yankee thug who everyone is afraid of so he cant get a girlfriend to save his life and Midori is an uptown girl who has had a crush on Seiji for the past 3 years but shes very shy and cant tell him. Then in a very odd twist of fate Midori ends up becoming Seiji's right hand. The following adventures and times they spend together are very sweet and endearing and funny. One thing i really liked about the show is i think everyone has felt the way Midori has at one time or another in there life, really liking someone and just not being able to tell them how you feel and wishing you could be closer to that person anyway you can and be yourself. The only sort of complaint i have is that its only 13 episodes long on 3 dvds so its over pretty quick, but all in all this is anime defiently worth checking out if your looking for a good laugh and something to make you smile and cry",1133308800,20,1123,4.109090909090909

8098718,3,B000CEV3SW,"My review is for the product only. I opened it and was surprised (and a bit disappointed) to find it had not 3 disks as advertised but the disc for Vol. 1 and a Midori Days T-shirt. It's not that minded so much but am quite irritated with Amazon for false information. There are other products out there with the complete collection but this isn't it. So here is what this product actually comes with:
*Vol. 1 of Midori Days
*Collectable t-shirt
*Limited edition (I'm assuming) box to fix all three volumes.

A message to Amazon: I love what the site has here, but for crying out loud please be more careful about product accuracy!  No one wants to wait two weeks to find out a box set of anime doesn't have what you say it has. This applies to literally everything.  Be more careful to ensure the products on this site are advertised for what they are and not misleading!

To the consumer:  Buyers beware. Take care to do your homework before you buy anything so you know exactly what your purchasing is supposed to contain and look like. Learn from my mistake.

This product receives 5/5 stars stand alone. It loses two stars for Amazon screwing up the info. Overall: 3/5 stars.

UPDATE:
I mentioned that the limited edition box should be able to hold all 3 DVD volumes of the show. I can't speak for others but I found this incredibly difficult. It's such a tight squeeze that it's almost impossible to pull a DVD out to watch. However, I have a recommendation for those who want to keep the box. If you don't have plans with the shirt then do what I did and neatly fold the shirt up and keep it inside the box. Then you can put the box on display, preserving the shirt in the process and put the DVDs wherever you like. I found that suits me best. So long story short, don't use the box to hold your collection in unless you don't intend to take them out of it.

The show was great by the way.  Solid 4/5 stars. If you can get accustomed to Midori's high pitched voice (ENG DUB) you'll like it more. It lost a star for the way the anime changed some things from the original story and because it should have been literally twice as long. Minor things in the end but enough for me to get a tad upset over. But don't let that steer you away. It's still worth watching and definitely reading.

Read the manga if you get the chance. It's far better than the anime and helps make sense of what the show lacks or changed.",1403481600,3,2419,4.2967032967032965
8098719,5,B000CEV3SW,"I love this series. It has a slightly absurd premise mixed with a lot of humor and heart, which breathes fresh life into a tired romantic comedy genre. The characters are vibrant and have depth while the storylines keep things moving and interesting.
Highly recommended.",1374624000,,270,5.022222222222222
8098720,5,B000CEV3SW,"This anime has a different kind of feel to it. Seiji is a high school delinquent with a good heart. He does skip class and get in fights, but he's the type of guy that has your back when you need a favor. Midori is a gentle natured girl that has had her eye on Seiji for years. She would like nothing more than to spend all of her days with Seiji. She gets her wish..... sort of. One day she wakes up lying in the bed with him. Sounds kinda kinky right; not really. She actually switched places with his ""demon right hand"". Their strange life together begins. Can Seiji fight off his enemies and maintain his reputation with a cute little girl coming out of his sleeve. Can Midori return to her real body and start a proper relationship with the guy she loves. You need to watch this anime and find out. It's one of a kind. I'm glad I stumbled onto it.",1354752000,3,852,4.13855421686747
8098721,4,B000CEV3SW,"I bought this series because I got a pretty good deal on it, and have had it recommended before.  The concept is pretty strange, but aside from the fact that the guy's right hand turns into a girl, everything else about the show is dealt with fairly realisticly from that point on.  Midori and her squeeky high-pitch voice can get annoying at times as shes constantly confessing her love for Seiji.  But theres quite a bit of humor throughout the show and everything sets up very well for an interesting last episode.  I guess you would call this a romantic comedy anime with a happy ending.  Nothing mind blowing here but good for a short 12 episode series. Certain aspects of this show remind me of Welcome to the NHK, which I highly recommend.",1352592000,,746,4.537313432835821
8098722,5,B000CEV3SW,"I read a manga before I watch an anime. I love both ! This is a very good series I has ever seen. I love Midori so much. She so cute !

I bought a normal boxset (with stikers). Now I want to buy this Premium boxset to complete my colletion :o), but I don't know what is different between a normal boxset (with stikers)and a premium boxset. Can someone tell me that? I really want to know that T^T

I think maybe premium boxset contain something very special, because it is very expensive! (more 40$ than a normal one)

Thank a lot !",1261440000,2,532,4.096153846153846
8098723,5,B000CEV3SW,You like cute things? You buy this. You watch. You squeal with delight several times per epy. You die happy. The End.,1208995200,5,117,4.363636363636363
8098724,2,B000CEV3SW,"First of all, I would like to say that I am quite disappointed to what they did with the anime.
The anime does not do justice for the manga (which is excellent, btw)
  a. much of the story is skipped over and discarded
  b. even if the manga was not read, the ending will seem rushed
However, if you decide to just watch the anime, it is a pretty good one; but, if you want something better, read the manga.  It is only 80 something chapters. I'm sure you can find some scanlation site in the internet and read it there.
Anime after/without reading manga: 2/3.5 stars
Manga: 4.5 stars",1196121600,5,584,4.2727272727272725
8098725,3,B000CEV3SW,"Despite what the rest of the reviews are saying Midori Days though somewhat charming is just you average anime. I picked this up because it sounded like it could be funny, and its not really. For once the amazon review was right, Midori days would have been good if it had just chosen who it wanted to watch it. There is some fan fair and fighting for guys but not enough to satisfy guys. There is romance for the girls but not enough to satisfy girls. There is genually funny moment but not enough to make you feel overly amused. On top of this Midori's American voice is annoying. All in all if you're a girl go watch Chobits or Fruits Basket. If you're a guy go watch Tenchi. And if you just want a good romance comedy then go watch Love Hina. Only buy this series if you have nothing else to buy.",1159228800,3,800,4.201298701298701
