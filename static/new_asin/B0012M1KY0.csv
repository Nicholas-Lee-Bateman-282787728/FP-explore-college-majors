3092170,3,B0012M1KY0,"As far as it goes, this documentary tells the dramatic story of the construction of the current Grand Central Station. It leaves out, however, the equally dramatic story of its restoration after decades of grime collection and neglect. Still, it's strong on the origins and early years of this monument, though it also leaves out any reference to the egregious destruction of next door Penn Station, a building at least as gorgeous as Grand Central.",1242604800,4,449,5.0
3092171,5,B0012M1KY0,"I had this on my movie subscription queue and it was a long wait getting it.  BOY! it was well worth the wait. This is an exceptional documentary visually and in content.  It begins with Vanderbilt's original terminus in the -then- hinterlands of Manhattan. Details the tragic accident which led to the ban on steam locomotives in Manhattan, the mandate placed on Vanderbilt to change to electric trains, the fierce competition he faced from the Pennsylvania Railroad and their sparkling new train station.  All the while it switches back to the present with beautiful shots of the restored terminal, time-lapse clips of the vast amount of foot traffic it serves and great bird-eye views of the grand avenue and skyscrapers that were made possible by submerging the electric rail system. Interesting comments show that times might not have changed as much as we think and public pressure CAN effect improvements. Although Vanderbilt had resources to complete this new terminal without public funding. I love GCT and I loved this DVD.  I am shopping for my own copy now, after watching the rental one 3 times in a row. I only wish I lived in New York City so I could visit this wonderful hub more often.",1231718400,8,1202,4.820388349514563
3092172,5,B0012M1KY0,"Awesome work for a documentary, sparing too many talking heads and rich in visuals of the period, this turns out to be one of the best American Experience films I've seen.  What a story!  Dramatic and thought provoking. If you love New York City history or the history of late 19th century technology and finance, this is for you.  Wonderful effects with 2 dimensional images that are rendered to seem 3D.  Great narrative and leaves you thinking long after.  I can never pass by or through GCT without thinking about this film.",1212796800,14,528,4.695652173913044

8246795,5,B0012M1KY0,"National Geographic's DVD celebration of Grand Central Terminal reminds me why GCT is one of my favorite buildings in the whole wide world. Every time I lament the death of Pennsylvania Station I quickly give thanks that GCT still survives and looking better than ever...and the best is yet to come when the East Side Connection brings LIRR trains into the heart of the city.

The informative narrative gives a historical overview of the Grand Central and its relationship to New York City.  It also exposes hidden secrets about the station never before revealed.

What the video doesn't reveal are the dark, dirty, and dangerous train platforms...a sharp and bitter contrast to the sparkling interior of main hall. Walking to and from Metro North trains on these grimy platforms often feels unsafe. This is a security risk that also deserves a major renovation.

One could literally eat off the floor under the train sheds of Paddington and St. Pancras in London. I wouldn't suggest trying that in Grand Central, Penn Station, 30th Street, or Washington Union Station.",1409616000,,1069,5.022598870056497
8246796,4,B0012M1KY0,Interesting but not too exciting.  It reminded me of the types of films they showed in high school.,1404086400,,99,4.5
8246797,5,B0012M1KY0,Amazing time in our history.  I'm so glad that these DVD's are available for those who are interested.  Very fascinating.,1397520000,,121,5.0
8246798,2,B0012M1KY0,"This video will disappoint almost anyone interested in 1) Grand Central Station, 2) railroads, 3) the disrepair it was in, before the 4) restoration. The video comes across as muddled and unfocused, as if it had been edited by a committee afraid of staying on one topic too long, lest it lose an audience with a short attention span. Consequently, it skips about, never landing on anything long enough to get the audience's attention.",1388275200,4,434,4.878378378378378
8246799,3,B0012M1KY0,This fairly brief video provides a reasonable introduction to the origin of Grand Central Terminal.  It provides no detail on how the terminal functions and as noted by another reviewer it is sparse on architectural detail.  However it is rich in images both still and moving from the time before and after terminal construction.  My wife and I found these historic video excerpts fascinating.  I also shutter at how close New York City came to losing this architectural gem.  The sound was clear and the video imaging was fine.,1378944000,,528,4.887640449438202
8246800,4,B0012M1KY0,"I'm a history buff, and I wanted more detail, especially about how GC had evolved in the later 20th century.  But otherwise I really enjoyed it.",1361232000,,144,4.538461538461538
8246801,2,B0012M1KY0,"This 50-minute study of GCT suffers from the same shortfall of the other major treatment [National Geographic's Inside Grand Central], that being it's way too long on history lesson and way too short on visual appreciation of GCT's architectural details.

Between minutes 13 and 44, there is less than 2 minutes total viewing of current Terminal imagery. Rather, that entire section of the film plods along as though it were a college lecture titled ""Historical Events Influencing the Construction of Grand Central Terminal: 1902 through 1913,"" with visuals mostly composed of talking heads and faux-animated historical stills, many of which are not of GCT proper but rather trains, tracks, newspaper headlines and other such whatnot.

That lecture is bookended with some scraps of decent look-sees, including some detail shots, in the first two minutes and final five minutes.

Neither any other historical period nor a drop of operational background of GCT is ever addressed during the film. At least it can be fairly said that NG's treatment is much broader in scope than this.

All in all, this film makes for a rather disappointing visiting of one of New York City's greatest architectural gems. Amazing any director wouldn't realize that most anyone wanting to view a film about GCT would be primarily interested in, well, viewing GCT. All this history would be of no interest, lest the building be as lovely and majestic as it is. And given even an on-site tour cannot provide an individual close look at most of the building's interior and exterior details, it seems reasonable a director would realize that this is exactly how the viewer can best be served.

Unless GCT is your life's obsession/passion - or your thesis topic - the film does not merit viewing.",1294444800,11,1769,5.023890784982935
