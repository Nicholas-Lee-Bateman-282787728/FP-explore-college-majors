398542,5,6301976045,"I first saw this movie on a Christmas Eve, with a roaring fire and a glass of zinfandel wine in my hand. Just thinking about this movie brings back a smile to my face!  This is a wonderful classic, with a timeless story.  I  highly recommend viewing this film (zinfandel optional).",928281600,,281,4.470588235294118
398543,5,6301976045,"Jimmy Stewart is fantastic and, as always sweeps his leading lady off her feet. Actually, he more so knocks her off her feet. Clashing wills so hard, the characters never truly realize that they both are in love with the  other, and who would, given that you're supposed to hate this person?  The  story of true love and true hatred has never been more beautifully shown.  Have you ever found yourself looking at your worst enemy in a new light?  Suddenly the boy you could never stand, becomes the man you could never  live without.  It's like when your mother said, ""He's just annoying  you because he likes you."" and then you end up being high school  sweethearts. The biggest problem these two face is who will crack and say  ""I love you"" first. No movie is more human. Exquisitly portrayed,  you'll find yourself caught in the middle of two completely different  people who are destined to be together. Turn down the lights, pop some  popcorn, cuddle up with your honey (a warm blanket will suffice), and enjoy  the ups and downs of these star-crossed lovers.",926553600,,1064,4.650537634408602
398544,5,6301976045,"This is one of our family's favorite movies.  There is nothing objectionable for children.  Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as usual.  My great hope is that the remake which comes out in a few months ( ""You've Got  Mail"" ) is half as good and will also be suitable for families.",911692800,,273,4.4
398628,5,6301976045,Love this movie.  Love the story and love all of the people in it.  The character actors are great and truly make the movie.  Of course Jimmy Steward and Margaret Sullivan are  just perfect.  Have watched this movie many times.,1519862400,,227,4.575
398629,5,6301976045,"I was sad to see this movie  missing from the holiday movie lineup this year on network television. So I found this 1940 film available on Amazon for streaming. For those of you who have never seen this movie, it's a classic. Let me just say this, if you like the 1998 film ""You've Got Mail"" starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, you will like this black & white classic starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. The Shop Around The Corner (aka: Matuschek & Company) is a small gift shop in Budapest Hungary staffed by interesting characters from the shop owner, Mr. Matuschek to his delivery boy, Pepi Catona.",1519430400,,609,4.587155963302752

398633,5,6301976045,Wonderful pre WWII era of a little shop in Budapest run by Frank Morgan (Wizard of Oz) with his chief store clerk played by Jimmy Stewart. Excellent store clerk cast with a snake in the grass while Stewart falls in love with the author of his secret correspondence. Margaret Sullivan wonderfully plays Stewart's adversary and mystery character. The ending is perfect for a Christmas ending but don't expect any accents.,1518739200,,419,5.0

398698,5,6301976045,"The Shop Around the Corner is one of those perennial Christmas classics like Meet Me In St. Louis in which only one scene takes place during the Christmas Season rather than being a film about Christmas. In both films it is an important scene and both films are full of the kind of warmth and charm that is totally in the spirit of the Holiday Season. The two films share other things as well: both get a 100% rating From Rotten Tomatoes and both have been chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Meet Me In St. Louis is a family story while The Shop Around the Corner is mostly a romance.

The film was directed by master director Ernst Lubitsch in the later part of his career. He went against many of his usual characteristics in this film. His reputation was based on making light, sophisticated films, often musicals, set in luxurious surroundings and inhabited by upper class characters. This film features ordinary people who work in a small shop, are afraid of losing their jobs and who mostly wear very ordinary clothes. There's no champagne and diamonds and no music at all except for Ochi Tchornya played by a musical cigarette case and later by a string quartet a a cafe. The screenplay was by Lubitsch's long-time collaborator Samson Raphaelson who adapted it from a play by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo and became the basis of In the Good Old Summertime and You've Got Mail. Surprisingly the film still takes place in Budapest despite the fact that no one even tries to sound Hungarian. This is all for the good since I can't even begin to imagine Jimmy Stewart trying to sound Hungarian.

It's a quiet film that gradually casts a spell as you get to know the characters and their lives at the small shop. With excellent direction and a good script you still need the right cast and this cast is absolutely excellent and works together beautifully. Jimmy Stewart is sincere as Alfred Kralik, the shop's oldest employee and lead sales clerk. He's gentle and soft spoken in that Stewart way but can be very tough if called upon. Margaret Sullavan is bright and hopeful as the new salesgirl who is carrying on a pen pal romance with a man she's never met. Frank Morgan (the Wizard of Oz) is for once in a non-comic role and shows he could be a good dramatic actor.

Two fine European actors play major supporting roles. Joseph Schildkraut, a matinee idol in the days of silent films is practically oily as the two-faced, dandyish Mr. Vardas, another sales clerk. Felix Bressart plays sales clerk Pirovitch, Kralik's friend and a man who because of having to support his wife and children has to go along with whatever the boss says. Though neither tries to sound Hungarian their presence reminds you that the film is taking place in Europe. William Tracy is comic as Pepi, the brash delivery boy who wants more than anything to be a sales person.

Smaller roles are filled by Sara Hayden (Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy movies), who plays as usual, a spinster. Charles Smith (Dizzy in the Henry Aldrich series) is Rudy, the new delivery boy. Inez Courtney is salesgirl Ilona whose role seems to be underwritten as she fades away into the background.

It's a heartwarming film by its end and you really want things to turn out well for the two potential lovers. The film isn't a frothy fantasy either, but introduces some serious topics that keep it grounded and real. It even seems topical today. Klara Sullavan) and Mr. Kralik (Stewart) don't exactly get along well in the shop. But one day she confesses that there is one thing she admires about him: ""When Mr. Kralik asks you to go into the stockroom with him to get some boxes, you go in with him and get some boxes.""",1512086400,,3729,4.6184012066365

398704,5,6301976045,"This film is a complete meal for those who love movies. It has drama, romance, and comedy. Above all, it has a good heart.

Jimmy Stewart's performance here reminds me a lot of ""Harvey"" in its good natured gentleness. He projects good sense and a patience that we should all strive for. Frank Morgan is spot on as the shop owner, shameless in the promotion of his wares, and jealous while suspecting his wife of stepping out. One of my favorites in the film is the character of Pirovitch ... another kind soul, but a family man who tries to keep from becoming a target of the little power struggles within the shop. Margaret Sullivan almost does TOO good a job as the salesgirl who forces her way into the shop and becomes a foil for Stewart's character. She is so snide to him a few times that its a little hard to embrace her at the end. The character Pepi is indeed peppy and adds a lot of zing to his spots.

Every scene is well crafted and convincing, and the movie is guaranteed to leave you with a feeling of warmth and in good spirits. And more, it's comic moments leave me chuckling aloud year after year ... not easy to do when I know the jokes and the moments so well.

My highest recommendation.",1503360000,7,1207,4.308370044052864

398895,5,6301976045,"This review is my reflection of the movie, ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1940).

Screwball comedy is a subgenre of comedy that became popular during the Great Depression era. It combines slapstick with fast-pace farce humor inside the dialogue of a sophisticated film. Contrary to preceding generation of films, screwball comedy often portrayed battle of the sexes where independent-minded females challenged masculinity. Accordingly, The Shop Around the Corner establishes the female character, Klara Novak, into a co-protagonist role through a man vs. woman conflict as she confronts the male character, Alfred Kralik (20:57). During this dispute, the female character was portrayed as an intelligent person who logically criticizes the male characters deficient memory in recollecting the dress she wore and confidently boasting her competency as a salesperson. The scene also depicted the female character as a person whos not intimidated by the male character, because she had successfully resisted the male characters dominance by telling him that what she wears is none of his business  all while matching an equal vocal tone and rate of speech as the male character.

By the half-time, it became apparent that both male and female actors performed synonymously to dramatize the battle of the sexes. Take for instance, during the numerous man vs. woman conflict scenes that were captured throughout the first half of the film (20:57, 28:07, 53:00), the two co-protagonists starts off a conversation as they do with any other characters. But, as the discussion continues over time, the actors speak at a faster rate, and their voice grows louder. The actors also modify their body postures and facial expressions; the stars frown and lean their body towards the opposing character when they confront each other, whilst throwing personal insults and expressing sarcasm. Hence, by articulating intrusive physical gestures and aggressive vocal tone, both actors together had built a man vs. woman conflict situation.

Although the film establishes the lead male and female as two co-protagonists, in my opinion, gender was an issue in this movie because the female characters performances were dependent upon the male characters signals. The female character is the one who acts out the cluelessness of the situation (50:20, 1:32:15), is the person who awaits the male (50:20, 1:08:48), becomes ill in the absence of males correspondence (1:10:40), and is emotionally responsive to male characters gestures (1:12:40, 1:36:10). Thus, the over-arching impression of the movie was depicted as the male characters adventure in winning over a woman that he wanted. And regardless of however strong of an impression that the female actor had left on the audience, the female character was ultimately an archetype object for the male character in the film.

Moreover, in regards to female characters influence on male character, although the male character fell in love with the female character, the female character does not have the characteristics of a femme fatale because she does not lead the male character into disaster nor does she purposely seduce the male character with some sort of diabolical plan. As a matter of fact, to reiterate my previous point, the female character does not have any active control in the film  she only reacts to the male characters actions.

I also found it deeply interesting when the actor contrasted her characters image. How was it possible that such a character that is so intelligent and resilient against the face of authority, be so weak and oblivious in front of love? The actor accomplished in making of this distinction by controlling her physical gestures and vocal tones like volume and pitch. When the actor was performing a strong character, the actor frowned and exerted a loud voice with an exclamation; actor acted out sarcasm by displaying a facial expression and speech utterance that contradicted the sentential response (20:57). In contrary, when the actor was acting out the submissiveness, she not only softened her speech but her entire body also became slowly stagnant (1:36:10). Overall, I think that the female actor had done a fantastic job.

The male characters super objective in the film is to reveal his anonymous identity to the female character that he had been blindly corresponding with over the mail. To achieve his super objective, one of the specific objectives that the male character had to accomplish was to approach the female character for the first time at a pre-arranged location (24:30). Unfortunately, the male character encounters a problem of having to discover that the mysterious woman who he had fallen for is actually his previous co-worker whom he had a bad relationship with. So he must overcome the obstacle of the womans negative perception of him. In order to overcome his obstacle, the male character attempts to approach the female character without offending her. In his attempt, the actor played the character in a different manner from how he normally approached her at workplace scenes. First, the actor approaches the female character at a distance slowly, full of hesitance. His body movement does not seem confident as perceived at workplace, which was fast paced. To illustrate the awkwardness, the actor cautiously moves his head around from side to side as if he is looking for someone, his lips are unparalleled and tucked in, and once he approaches the female character, he acts as if he had met her in coincidence. The actors manner of speech makes a contrasting differentiation as well. In previous scenes, the male character had always spoken in quick and bickering manner toward the female character. However, at the restaurant, the actor starts off a conversation with a slow and calming tone of voice, which is unprecedented prior to this scene.

Asides from the domain of romance, the film showcased an abundant amount of comical scenes with a good mixture of both verbal and physical humor. For example, during the early scenes depicted in 8:14, 16:04, and 18:39, the employer character verbally prepares for a punch line by asking his employees, all I want is your honest opinion Then, every time when the employer asks for an honest opinion, Pirovitch  one of the employees  executes a punch line wit'h physical gesture by hiding away in panic. Although I cannot determine whether the comical scene produces laughter amongst the audience, I personally think that the usage of verbal cues were effective with the exaggerated physical movements performed by Pirovitch. According to the lecture, slapstick was effective in silent movies because title cards slowed down the soundless films. So, silent movies had to rely heavily on exaggerated physical gestures and the directors aimed to use as few title cards as possible. On the contrary, The Shop Around the Corner consisted of audio recordings and the linguistic communication did not hinder the continuation flow of the film. Thus, adjoining the verbal and physical gestures allowed the film producers to invest in time, to deliver a joke at the appropriate timing.

398896,4,6301976045,"A long time ago, I fell in love with the movie, An Affair to Remember.  I was delighted to see it become a springboard for the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan film, Sleepless in Seattle.  When Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan came out with their film, Youve Got Mail, I heard rumors it had been inspired by an old movie too.  Being an old movie fan, I went searching and found The Shop Around the Corner which most definitely inspired Youve Got Mail.

The Shop Around the Corner is a delightful movie with some very well known actors of the day.  The storyline is extremely similar to Youve Got Mail and I loved seeing where it all started.  I would highly recommend this movie on its own merits, but it is that much better if you are a fan of Youve Got Mail.

398940,4,6301976045,"Nowadays with the advent of about seven different forms of social networking (including the ubiquitous sexting among the young, and their elders too from what I hear) a film about two young people who find their romantic fates intertwined anonymously while working together in the same employment would probably draw yawns, maybe a cynical snicker that of course that is the proper way to meet a mate-do you know that, stupid. In fact a more recent film, Youve Got Mail, pays homage to that newer technology, newer than snail mail, to the now passe e-mail, as it pays homage to the original film adaptation of an Eastern European play, The Shop Around The Corner, reviewed here.

Technology aside this is another rather stylish romantic comedy set in Budapest before the war as the expression went then meaning before World War II (although while I am thinking about the matter why anybody bothered to decide to fake set it in that locale since the scenarios all looked like Hollywood sets and the actors all spoke if not the Kings English then at least English not the universal language of choose in 1940 Budapest). The romantic comedy part, the center of the whole film, is the knock down drag out relationship between Alfred the head salesman at a luggage and leather goods shop and Klara a newly hired employee who take every opportunity to put each other down.

But get this Alfred and Klara have been conducting a long distance high-mined pen-pal relationship with each other not knowing that they were corresponding with each other. You remember pen-pals in elementary school, right. You would write to some guy or girl in say Indianapolis and they would write back about school, summer vacations and stuff with no expectation of ever meeting, Indianapolis being a place that might as well have been on another planet then. Well back in those days adults could do the same except they expected to meet. The way they would do it is to answer discreet inquiries placed in the Personal section of the newspaper if you can believe that. Then write each other by snail mail to post office boxes. Yeah, ancient history and in that time today a guy or gal could have already dumped or had about six affairs and had time for a long lunch without working up a sweat.

Of course the Alfred-Klara build-up to real in person romance has to work its way through a few sub-plots to justify a couple of hours at the movie house back in the day. The shop owner suspicious of Alfreds alleged attentions to his unseen on film fires him until he finds out that another employee has been stealing his wifes time. The discovery has that shop owner suicidal which works out to Alfreds benefit as he becomes the manager while the owner recovers. There is also some side action with the ambitious errant boy moving up the food chain by his own pluck and luck. Some play as well with a frightened to lose his job clerk who is something of an Alfred confidante.

But make no mistake that the Alfred-Klara mix and match is the main draw here as they can hardly stay in the same room until Alfred accidently finds out that his fellow correspondent is none other than Klara. With that knowledge Alfred puts on a full-court press to wow the unknowing Klara. Classic Libitsch, classic feel good Hollywood. Watch the pros go through their paces even if you are too young to know about Personals, about writing high-brow love letters and going to the Post Office to conduct a love affair. Okay.",1460419200,,3469,4.672667757774141

398971,5,6301976045,"Man, I loves me a list. And not that anyone asked, but I've got me a list of top five favorite Christmas movies. And it just so happens Jimmy Stewart is in two of those movies: 1946's It's A Wonderful Life and 1940's The Shop Around the Corner. Ernst Lubitsch has directed a crapload of classic films, and you can talk up your Ninotchka and The Merry Widow and To Be Or Not To Be and The Love Parade, but I think The Shop Around the Corner trumps them all. I even venture to say it's Lubitsch's best joint. Yes, I know, I love me those operettas, too.

But I believe The Shop Around the Corner to be the perfect movie, a timeless classic. It's easily the best of the four pictures that paired up Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. It's a film what's graced with an acting ensemble that bring their best efforts. This may be the best Frank Morgan has ever been. It's a story that torments the romantic sap in you. I know at least three really good movies inspired by this one: In the Good Old Summertime (1949), You've Got Mail (1998), and Christmas in Boston (2005).

Through all incarnations, the premise remains the same. A man and a woman who cannot stand each other, these same two who embark on a courtship thru anonymous written correspondence. Ernst Lubitsch adapts Mikls Lszl's ""Parfumerie,"" a 1936 play that posits that in Budapest, Hungary, just around the corner from Andrassy Street, on Balta Street, one can frequent that fine old leather goods emporium, Matuschek & Co. Early in the morn, you may see the staff waiting to be let in. Perhaps, senior salesman Alfred Kralik (Stewart) is updating his good friend, the meek and gentle soul Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), re the latest letter from his ""Dear Friend."" Unctuous peacock Ferencz Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) may regale his couldn't-care-less colleagues about his most recent gaudy triumphs. Ambitious errand boy Pepi (William Tracy) is all big talk and optimism. And Flora (Sara Haden) and Ilona (Inez Courtney) who, sad to say, serve as mere background dressing for the narrative. But all of them waiting for the peremptory proprietor, Hugo Matuschek (Morgan), to let them in.

As senior salesman, Kralik has had his own way for years, the only one on staff never afraid to speak his mind and disagree with the boss. Imagine how it rankles him, then, when prospective employee Klara Novak (Sullavan) proceeds to show him up by making a quick sale of an item he'd just disparaged. So there's the seed of the quarrelsome relationship betwixt Kralik and Miss Novak.

I have to say it took a minute for me to warm up to Stewart's character. Kralik is at times so dour as to render him unsympathetic. I got over it but I wasn't truly on his side until he peered into that restaurant window. As for Miss Sullavan, gosh, I wish she'd made more movies. She is so good. You can sense the fierce intelligence of her, and I find it so sexy. And you can sense the sparks between the two even as they bicker and bag on each other, and you can tell when the other's words strike a particularly nasty chord because the hurt on the recipient's face says it all.

This'd be a fine motion picture if it were all just about the fractious romance. But Lubitsch is all about layers. The snap in the dialogue, the expert wisecracking, his patented light touch - that's all there. What elevates this movie to something exceptional is its edge. There are fragile moments here and bleak bits of desolation, intrusions into reality that should've submarined the overall tone of the film but instead round it out into this complete viewing experience. The secret weapon is Frank Morgan whose bleak story arc Lubitsch handles with grace and great delicacy. As a result, Morgan's character, imperious then seething then despairing, comes across as the most human of the lot.

I don't even care that none of them sound even vaguely Hungarian. Wouldn't even recognize a Hungarian accent if I heard one. This is Lubitsch's enduring masterpiece, sentimental but then starkly unsentimental, bursting with charm and gravity and a quaint old vibe. The romance leaves you hanging until the very last moments, and it's all the more rewarding for that. Year after year, it remains a pleasure to watch. Especially around the holidays.

What else is on my list of top five favorite Christmas movies, no one asked? Miracle on 34th Street (1947), Holiday Affair (1949), Love Actually (2003), Lethal Weapon (1987), and my top favorite - Die Hard (1988). Wow, I am bad at math.",1450915200,,4502,4.7055837563451774
398972,4,6301976045,"So much better than you got mail. The problem with that film was that the plot was convoluted. Here, the two main characters are co workers who are, unbeknownst to them, corresponding via mail. Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Klara Novak (Margaret Sullivan) are co-workers in a small store owned by Hugo Matuschek. While at first it seems Kralik is a genuinely nice guy and Klara seems to like him just fine, as most working situations do, the little things get to them until - fast forward a few weeks, they are insulting each other and bickering over the kind of blouse Klara chooses. Both are single and basically tolerate each other at work because each longs to meet the person they are corresponding with anonymously but never mention to anyone. Through a surprisingly dark, for the time, subplot that involves an identity mix up, Kralik is temporarily let go on the same night he is to meet his anonymous pen pal. Cue his realization that it is Klara...when he really isn't in a good position to attempt to make things work. The good news is that the mix up is resolved, Kralik gets a promotion and works extremely hard to soften Klara up at work. And unlike you got mail, here, Klara admits, sure in her knowledge of her pen pal's adoration that at first she did have a bit of a crush of Kralik.  In this situation, I did believe that these two could eventually make it work where I kind of had a hard time with that in Your got mail.

Now, I do have to take a star off because this is a 1940s film and it is painful for a modern audience. Klara is practically begging for a job at first, and there is the sexism of the day that is sort of painful to watch i.e., Kralik being dispatched to tell Klara what to wear. The employer is sort of a jerk and everyone is like a puppy trying to please and I suppose it just makes me happy for modern employment laws. Klara explicitly mentions to Kralik that she is hoping to marry her pen pal and he would take her away from having to work.  Also in someways the movie is painfully slow and has entire scenes you want to just fast forward through. It is a 1940s movie. If you can get through that... and stay for the nuggets of goodness... you will like it.",1450569600,,2207,4.326086956521739

399107,5,6301976045,"You may recall Gloria Swanson's famous line from ""Sunset Boulevard"" where, as the aged silent movie star Norma Desmond, she proclaims, ""We didn't need dialogue.  We had faces!""

True, ""The Shop around the Corner"" is a ""talkie.""  But if you want to really appreciate what Norma Desmond said, focus on one particular moment in this movie.  It's in the caf scene where Stewart knows the truth about Sullavan (that she's the woman he's been corresponding with) but Sullavan doesn't know that about Stewart.

After some back-and-forth between the two, in which Stewart tries to build a bridge to her and she keeps tearing it down, she finally concludes, with a scornful laugh, ""You insignificant little man.""

NOW: watch Stewart's face.  It's a slow take, and I won't describe it here.  Just to say that his wounded heart and soul are shown more vividly than any words could convey, in those few moments.

If you're addicted to non-stop action, special effects and quick cuts in your movies, you won't see a thing.  But Stewart is magnificent, without saying a word.

For those who think this movie is ""dated,"" because of its year, its setting, its lack of special effects and lack of let-it-all-hang-out sex, take a close look at Stewart's face.  That look can never be dated.",1411603200,,1272,4.837962962962963

399193,5,6301976045,"I always feel ashamed when I find out that a classic film has been remake and Ive seen the remake but never the classic film and, in all honesty, had no idea that the classic film was the inspiration for the remake.  I feel like I should know these things.  So, when I found out that The Shop Around the Corner, a film that I had been wanting to see for some time now, was actually the inspiration for 1998s Youve Got Mail I felt terrible.

Why didn't I watch this movie sooner?

The problem when watching these classic films that youve seen the modern remake for is that you tend to confuse the two, failing to separate them as individual films and wind up comparing them or waiting for the original to follow the same storyline as the remake.  It was in that that I found myself detached from The Shop Around the Corner and I wound up having to restart the film because I wasn't paying attention.  I was waiting for it to take the same shape as Youve Got Mail and it was distracting and I found myself not connecting with this film, which was weird for me.  So, on a second try I found The Shop Around the Corner to be a truly inspired film, one that I didn't wholly expect (because of preconceived notions).  Youve Got Mail, while a typically delightful romantic comedy, doesnt have the societal significance of The Shop Around the Corner, even though it tries to (big business taking over local business being a theme there).

For me, the depth in the subplots here is where the real joy is found.

Its almost weird for me to think that The Shop Around the Corner is not a romantic comedy.  I mean, it is in a way, but in many ways it is not.  Margaret Sullavan, while top billed, is relegated to a supporting player here and while Alfred Kralik (James Stewarts character) is falling in love with his pen pal (and the main storyline does concern him finding her) the story takes so many other, more colorful directions.  The films main concern is telling a story of economic crisis, family hardships, betrayed trust, the cruel blow of assumption, loyalty and eventually the ideal that what you really want and need in life is right in front of you.

The Shop Around the Corner tells the story of Alfred Kralik, a dedicated sales clerk who works for Hugo Matuschek.  When Klara Novak enters his store looking for a job, Alfred is skeptical, but Hugo is smitten and she soon is battling Alfred over everything.  Klara becomes a beloved member of the team, while Alfred remains somewhat distanced from her.  In the meantime, neither knows that they are secretly falling in love with each other through letters they are writing to an anonymous pen pal.  As they fall in love in secret, they grow even more distanced in person.  While this lovers quarrel is brewing, Matuschek himself is dealing with a more real quarrel concerning his dwindling business and his wifes indiscretions (both infidelity and financial squandering) and when he starts to draw his own conclusions based on what he perceives in his own store, the results are heartbreaking (for him and those involved).

Ernst Lubitsch had such a flowing ease about his films.  He had this delightful way of building characters and scenarios with an effortless swish of his brush, never bogging his films down or making them feel too heavy despite containing some very weighty themes.  I know that many adore Capra, but Lubitsch knew how to make a Capra film better than Capra did.  The Shop Around the Corner is a prime example of this; a film that has such heavy situations (especially when concerning Matuscheks personal life) and yet has such a light and subtle touch that keeps it all feeling so natural and human.

And Ill say this; James Stewart won the Oscar for the wrong film this year.  While I love The Philadelphia Story as a film (even more so than this one, if Im being honest), that movie was really all about Cary Grant and Ive always been baffled that Stewart won the Oscar for that film.  He truly should have been nominated for this film instead, for his layered portrayal of Alfred is astonishing and really heartbreaking (and lifting).  Stewart is one of my favorite actors of all time, and one thing that Ive always admired about him was the way that he was able to sift through so many different emotions so naturally.  He can be dramatic, sincere, comedic and romantic in the same film and at times in the same moment and have it all feel so genuine.  He does that here, and the scene in the caf&eacute;, when his pride is wounded by Klara, is such a brilliant moment.

The rest of the cast is very good, Margaret Sullavan and Frank Morgan taking top honors.  Morgan in particular is VERY strong as the emotionally wounded Matuschek.  In fact, he may give my favorite performance in this film, because he shields the truth about his persona so beautifully and develops it with such gradual realism.  When he has his big moment in the shop all alone (saved by Pepi) I could feel under my skin every emotion Morgan was filtering.

He gave me chills.

My only qualm here is the performance by William Tracy.  His Pepi was beyond obnoxious and took me out of the film in many moments.  I know that he was there for broad comic relief, but he was just straight up annoying and should have been stripped from the film entirely.  I don't hate many characters in films that I love, but he fits the bill.

But I do love this movie!  Really that is what matters.  This is sharp, poignant and entertaining, and few films can be all those things and still remain smooth and comforting.",1389657600,,5556,4.53259779338014

The only thing I found wrong with the picture (which I'm pretty sure was done because American audiences wouldn't understand Hungarian currency) is that it takes place In Hungary, but the prices shown on the cash register are in American currency.

I am charmed by the scenes in Budapest, and was so pleased with the interwoven story lines that I was only slightly put off by the mix of Hungarian and American accents. (I would have preferred all Hungarian.)  The pace is a bit slow, but that's in keeping with the courtly Hungarian manners of that era.

In a nutshell, two clerks in a gift shop are, unbeknownst to both, communicating as anonymous pen pals in their private lives whilst taking potshots at each other at work during the day.  But that complication doesn't begin to capture the charm of the movie, as other equally interesting plots and relationships are unfolding amongst the shop owner's family and in the individual lives of the four other clerks.

The fact it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch has a great deal to do with that ranking, and (from a purely personal perspective) the presence of Jimmy Stewart. I don't do rankings but if I had to rank my favorite actor of all time it would be Stewart, and he absolutely shines in this film. Margaret Sullavan is perfectly cast as his pen-pal and love interest and in real life there was a short-lived romance and long friendship between the two...they did four movies together. The support cast, especially Frank Morgan (""THE WIZARD OF OZ"") and Felix Bressart, are perfect too and add a great deal of texture to this film that is lacking in the two remakes. Selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, it is ranked #28 on AFIs 100 years, 100 Passions. The two remakes are excellent too and it is only by virtue of the fact Ive seen all three that I can put this one at the top. But by all means check out the 1949 version, ""In the Good Old Summertime"", with Judy Garland and Van Johnson in the starring roles; and the 1998 version, ""You've Got Mail, starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan.

""An ill-bred man, especially one who behaves in a dishonorable or irresponsible way toward women.""

Tom Hanks did an admirable job of portraying similarly disgraceful behavior in ""You've Got Mail"".

Margaret Sullavan is that odd combination of vulnerable and bossy that is so prominent in the World War II era movies, and Jimmy Stewart is his normal excellent self, playing a strong, principled, but also vulnerable character.

James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Frank Morgan in a Ernst Lubitsch production certainly seemed promising. Unfortunately, I found the film to be rathery dul and unexciting. James Stewart does a fine job as the serious store clerk dealing with a perky but unkind coworker played by Margaret Sullavan.  Stewart actually looked handsome in a dashing way and he does light up the screen.
The odd thing is about the film is that it is set in Budapest, yet, except for the way last names are pronounced and the use of different currency, there is nothing Hungarian about the setting. Why bother to set it in Budapest when it could have easily have been any town in America?

Sullvan's character is rather unkind and beligerent to Stewart's clerk. It seems so painful and unnecessary, especially when you realize the secret they both unknowingly share. I know this film spawned remakes and copycats but what is the point here?

I know this is a beloved film and it has gotten high reviews. I just don't see much of merit in this film. I am actually sorry I did not watch another film instead of this one.",1357084800,,1203,4.63849765258216

They mock one another and the mocking includes caustic comments made by each regarding the other's unseen love interests. What neither of them know is that their love interests are one another as they have been carrying on a correspondence with one another by mail and know one another neither by name  nor appearance. The movie deals with the concept that people you know only casually are quite often people you don't know at all.
This film is populated with good actors, snappy dialogue, supporting  characters that are quirky and interesting because they have their own issues and are well developed. Because much of the action occurs around the Christmas season, this is often thought of as a Christmas movie, but the seasonal timing is only incidental. It is a story that is easy to relate to and enjoyable to seen played out.

Oh yeah, I'm the hundredth person to give a five-star review of The Shop Around The Corner!  It's not my fervor for this movie though, it actually deserves it.  The premise is so original and not overly-dramatic or sappy.  It may not seem original to people today, but that's only because this movie was the foundation for movies of this plot-line that followed suit afterward (but rarely ever came close to this, haha).  The Shop Around the Corner also is multifaceted in its storyline.  There's the slow and enigmatic budding of a new love, an adulterous and tragic end to a twenty-two-year-long one-sided love (""Well, she... just didn't want to grow old with me,"" that line kills me every time), the rekindling of an old friendship, and many other instances.  Oh, and of course Pepi (""Your perfume days are over!"").  I'm not into film studies and all that stuff, but the inexplicable way that everything was put together is beautiful; like cigarettes and music.  For instance when Mr. Vadas is thrown to the floor, and everyone runs toward him, only to pick up the musical boxes.  Hilarious!  This cast was chosen perfectly as well.  I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part of anyone else, even those of the minor characters.  Altogether, this movie is absolutely wonderful and it deserves five stars!... no matter what any others say.  My jaw has dropped so many times at reading the many reviews about how this movie not being too good because it's ""not the Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks remake"" You've Got Mail.  Seriously?  I'm having trouble finding the sense of thinking that the original doesn't live up to the remake...

399514,4,6301976045,"""The Shop Around the Corner"" is just delightful to watch.  Made in 1940, it includes several serious sub-plots - includes the infidelity of the store owner's wife - but focuses on two shop clerks that seem to hate each other, but maintain a secret pen-pal letter writing relationship.  Neigther one realizes they are writing to each other.  Letters are picked up at the post office in their post boxes.  Set in Budapest Hungary, the shop is called ""The Matuschedk and Company"".  It is owned by Mr. Hugo Matusheck (Frank Morgan).  Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart) is his best and most senior salesman.  Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) is hired as a saleswoman in the store but Kralik and Novak soon start fighting.  They cannot stand each other.  Kralik is lonely and has a pen pal he plans to propose to.  Mr. Matuschek fires him the night he is going to meet his new and secret love.  He goes to the cafe they are to meet and he is dumbfounded that Klara is his secret pen pal.  He is now unemployed and cannot support a wife, plus he is embarrassed so he chooses not to identify himself as her pen-pal.  The next day Matuschek discovers he has made a big mistake and hires Kralik back the next day in the position of manager.  Klara is wondering why her pen-pal did not show up and is still in love with the anonymous ardent writer.

The plot is wonderful, and a work of art as complex issues are handled clearly .  This movie has been remade to reflect the modern age of computers and emails - ""You've Got Mail"" is the updated version of this charming story.  It is well worth your time to see both, and compare the old and new ways.",1292889600,,1633,4.426174496644295

399516,4,6301976045,"When it comes to comedy, Jimmy Stewart is tops and Shop Around the Corner is no exception.

Shop Around the Corner has been done a few times both in film and stage, it's most recent incarnation was the Tom Hanks' film, You've Got Mail.

In both films we have a man who is in correspondence with a woman but neither knows the others' names, even though they know each other in the real world.

Is it a shame that in the real world they hate each other but in the correspondence world they love each other?  What's up with that?  The film has a great way of resolving this with each finding the other somewhat attractive and things work out in the end.

The films diverge in the subplot.  Matuschek runs a novelty store in Bucharest where Jimmy Stewart's character (Kralak) works.  Carla, played by Margaret Sullavan, is a new clerk who instantly dislikes Kralak.  Only the audience knows that they love each others' letters!

But in the subplot the owner discovers some disturbing news and attempts suicide!  Kralak comes to his aid and at the same time realizes who his pen pal really is.  The rest of the film is a resolution of not only his relationship with his boss and crew, but the humorous way that he plays on Carla before she realizes who her pen pal really is.

And just like in You've Got Mail,&nbsp;] the meeting is a match made in heaven.  Ah, Hollywood!

The best scene for me is when Carla reaches not her post office box and a hesitant gloved hand gropes but does not find the letter she was expecting.  The look of disappointment on her face is quite heartbreaking.

Great performances, a bit of overacting and some dark moments pepper this entertaining romantic comedy.

399552,5,6301976045,"There is long list of movies to watch around Christmas time. Everyone knows true classics such as; it's a wonderful life, Scrooge, Christmas carol, Miracle on 34th street, and many others. There are some movies not usually mentioned but must be called a Christmas classics, and this particular movie definitely makes that list. This is a beautiful love story set around Christmas time starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.

Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Klara Novak (Margaret Sullivan) offer brilliant performances as two pen-pals who are in love but don't know that they are pen pals, in spite of the fact the two work in the same gift shop. The setting is simply great and very family oriented. This movie is set in Yuletide spirit with bells ringing, Christmas carols in the background, Christmas wreaths decorating the walls, homes, shops and buildings, and streets and neighborhoods covered with fresh snow. This movie was superbly directed by Ernst Lubitsch who made other classics such as; Angel (starring Marlene Dietrich), Ninotchka, and Heaven can wait (1943 version). Frank Morgan as Hugo Matuschek, the store owner has provided a splendid supporting role as store owner and very sensitive manager who respects the opinion of his employees and run the place a like a well knit family. Other workers include, the snippy errand boy, Pepi Katona (William Tracy), the caring and mild-mannered clerk, Pirovitch (Felix Bresssart), philandering Ferencz Vadas (Joseph Schildrakraut), and clerks Ilona (Sara Haden) and Flora.

Hugo Matuschek learns that his wife is having an affair and through a detective agency finds out that a store worker is the culprit. Thinking that Alfred is the guilty man he fires him. Later, when Hugo Matuschek learns that his wife is actually having an affair with Vadas, he despairs and tries to end his life, but is saved by Pepi Katona. Finally Alfred is re-hired as a store manager who fires Vadas, and rallies the store employees to make the biggest sale on Christmas Eve. Hugo Matuschek returns to a happy reunion and at last, the feuding Alfred and Klara become friends and she confides her love for him and he finally reveals himself as her secret lover. There is a fair amount of ""Frank Capra dynamics"" in the movie, at times it is very touching and the spirit of Christmas as envisioned by Charles Dickens flows through the mind and hearts of store workers, especially Alfred and Klara.

399553,5,6301976045,"Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan), desperate for work, wheedles her way into a sales clerk job at Matuschek & Company, a small Budapest department store run by the quick-tempered, blustery Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan, in probably his best-known role next to the Wizard in THE WIZARD OF OZ).  She quickly makes something of an enemy of the head clerk, Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) - but at the same time, both are falling in love with anonymous pen-pals, and it won't take a genius to figure out how this will resolve, especially as the film moves from autumn to Christmas, and sales and personal pressures grow for everyone.  The contrast between the poetic inner lives of these two young and struggling people, and their hard and sarcastic exteriors reflects a whole array of personalities that are really not what they seem - obsequeious clerk Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) turns out to be playing his own game; Matuschek's snap-tempered exterior belies an inner warmth, and the never-get-involved Pirovitch (Felix Bressart) turns out to be loyal and brave in a pinch.

The first of three Hollywood films based on Mikls Lszl's play ""Parfumerie"", and far and away the best (IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME (1949), a color musical with Judy Garland, Van Johnson and Buster Keaton, and YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998) with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are the remakes).  This is classic old-school Hollywood filmmaking with a snappy, sparkling scrpt, assured and elegant but never ostentatious direction, and flawlessly turned performances by everyone from Sullavan and Stewart to the wonderful array of character actors, with Bressart and William Tracy as fast-climbing errand-boy turned clerk Pepi deserving special mention.  The overall feeling is one of inner warmth and humanity struggling to break through in a fast-paced, commercial and on-the-edge-of-poverty lower middle class society.  Everybody's in it for themselves - but only because they cannot see another way; the poetry and beauty of Tolstoy, or Zola, or a fine meal or champagne and someone to share it with are always struggling to seep through the hardened cynicism.  There is also, along with the sense that many are hiding their best selves, the understanding that just as many people - sometimes the same people - are hiding their worst, and Mr. Matuschek's inner fears over his (never seen) wife, and the mistakes he makes over them, are the strongest evidence.

If there's a flaw to the film, it might be that Stewart - despite being second-billed to Sullavan - ends up dominating the film in the second half a little too much, not through any fault of his own really but because he learns his epistolary love's identity first, and plays around with her in a somewhat underhanded (some might say cruel) way - but the film tries to equate the hardness of Stewart and Sullavan, and it doesn't entirely come off to me.  Maybe that's my inner feminist working, I don't know.  Still it's a minimal flaw in one of the finest of all Hollywood romantic comedies, the best film probably in the sadly short career of Margaret Sullavan.  An every-year holiday favorite for me only a step or two behind IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, though it should be said that the ""Christmas"" theme of the film isn't really all that significant a part of its joy.",1261785600,2,3282,4.938294010889292

They are constantly bickering and finding fault with each other.  Privately, each of them is carrying on a romantic correspondence with a secret penpal.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce they are actually corresponding with each other, but haven't the slightest idea.  It doesn't matter that the viewer figures this out relatively early.

The tension between Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (James Steward) wasn't very well developed, and it is hard to tell whether I would have really understood what was going on without having first seen ""You've Got Mail"".  It was as if we were just supposed to know the reason that they were on less than friendly terms, but nothing really happened to develop why they were supposed to be unfriendly.

399705,5,6301976045,"Ernst Lubitsch was a master of the unexpected comedy element, something so idiosyncratic that it defies serious explanation. This charming 1940 classic epitomizes his style so well that the subsequent remakes appear either marginally pointless (the musical 1949 version, ""In the Good Old Summertime"") or excruciatingly formulaic (1998's e-mail update, ""You've Got Mail""). That's why for my 1,000th review on Amazon, I strongly recommend this wondrous and gentle romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.

Written by Samson Raphaelson, the souffl&eacute;-light plot involves the staff at Matuschek & Company, a Budapest leather goods emporium run by its curmudgeonly namesake. Head clerk Alfred Kralik is on the management track when Klara Novak impresses Matuschek enough to get hired as a new sales clerk. Inevitably, Alfred and Klara are at odds with each other from the start, but we discover they are also unwitting pen-pals who are falling in love without having met. Meanwhile, Matuschek suspects his wife of having an affair and suspects Alfred, whom he immediately terminates. When it turns out not to be Alfred but his despised co-worker, the bootlicking toady Ferencz Vadas, Matuschek commits a desperate act which forces Alfred to become the interim store manager. The busy Christmas season provides the appropriate setting to resolve all the plot strands.

What strikes me most about the film is not the actual storyline, which borders on predictable and contrived upon closer inspection, but the way Lubitsch and the cast bring it to life in such subtly memorable ways. Young and assured, Stewart gives one of my favorite of his performances as Alfred, and with her buttery speaking voice, Sullavan provides the perfect match as Klara. Their chemistry is palpable and makes the subsequent remakes feel comparatively pallid. The Wizard himself, Frank Morgan portrays Matuschek with alternate bluster and poignancy. The other players also make vivid impressions, in particular, Lubitsch regular Felix Bressart as the timid Pirovitch, a cast-against-type Joseph Schildkraut as the slimy Vadas, and William Tracy as the resourceful errand boy Pepi. The print transfer on the 2002 DVD is blessedly clean, and there are two extras offered, the original theatrical trailer and a 1940 short, ""The Miracle of Sound"" about the impact of the sound revolution at MGM.",1163980800,7,2388,5.416666666666667

Margaret Sullavan to Jimmy Stewart

This most magical of films has been remade many times over the passing years, but none can compare to the original smile-fest of love right under our nose from director Ernst Lubitsch. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart lend considerable charm to this tale of a little store in Budapest and two people in love who aren't aware they are corresponding.

An enchanting score fom Werner R. Heymann, and art direction from Cedric Gibbons give this MGM production a special mood no film since has come close to. Based on a play by Nikolaus Laszlo, Samson Raphaelson's screenplay is like a smile you can't hold back. The story is slight but sweet, executed in marvelous fashion by two great stars and an excellent supporting cast.

Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart) is the head clerk at Matuschek and Co., a small gift shop in Budapest, Hungary. Times are hard and when Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) comes in looking for a job there is immediate friction between the two. Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) is the gruff owner who needs Alfred's advice but resents such, making for an uncomfortable working relationship.

Once Klara sells a cigarette box that plays ""Artichonia"" Alfred thought was a bad idea, Mr. Matuschek hires her. Alfred and Klara are like fire and water at work, both only living for the moment they can exchange letters with their sweetheart. Neither has ever seen their true love, of course, and as it turns out, unbeknownst to either, they are in love with each other!

Matters are complicated by the infidelity of Mr. Matuschek's wife, since he strongly suspects one of his trusted employees of coming between them. The revelation by a detective Hugo hires will lead to a desperate act that will change not only the face of Matuschek and Co., but the working relationship of Alfred and Klara as well. He can't stand to see her heart break so keeps the letters coming, hilariously working in the fact that he's seen Alfred, pegging him as the type girls fall for!

There are scenes of sweetness and charm seldom matched in any film in this true classic. Klara's waiting at a small restaurant with a book by Tolstoy and a red carnation, while Alfred and his delightful pal Pirovitch (Felix Bressart) discover for the first time that Klara's the girl is not to be forgotten. The final scene, on a snowy Christmas Eve in Budapest, when Alfred finally reveals himself to be her suitor is delightful.

This is a film of delicate grace and humor, showing us that love is often right under our noses, if we could only find the words. A romantic film that will have you smiling all the way through. Don't miss this one!",1151366400,15,2721,4.725738396624473
399743,3,6301976045,"When I was in college, I fell in love with the show SHE LOVES ME and saw it twice with the original cast (and got autographs of most of them!). I'd always heard about THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, the source material for the film, but hadn't seen it until last night.

It has its good points, certainly, especially in the supporting players. I found them far more believable and likeable than the leads. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan actually held no interest for me.

The book of a musical must of necessity be more concise than a screenplay, since (especially in the case of SHE LOVES ME) the songs tell so much about character. But Joe Masteroff, who wrote the libretto, really did a magnificent job of streamlining the plot and making it more consistent and understandable. He also gave much more for Ilona to do. In the film, she's barely there.

I suppose it's largely because I've known the loved the musical for nearly 45 years, but I really wanted to hear the songs and see certain characters interact as they did on stage. It made me rather disappointed in the film. According to some information on the DVD, MGM had planned on filming SHE LOVES ME, but a change in upper management caused the project to be shelved. What a pity! Maybe someone with brains will remember that and do it now. There seems to be a slight renaissance of movie musicals. Let's hope SHE LOVES ME is one they green-light!",1149552000,,1410,4.543307086614173
399744,4,6301976045,"I was having a discussion about old movies with a woman who loves the classic old movies, and I was surprised to hear her say that she dislikes Jimmy Stewart.  She feels that he always has an attitude.  Her comments went against the grain of her usually very positive response to old movies.

I see her point.  Let's not idolize Jimmy Stewart.  There is something wolfish, tough, predatory, about him, something brusque and rude about him.  What passes for his being an ""everyman"" can also be looked at as rudeness, as a lack of consideration for others.  I see no reason to give him a free pass, just because he is at the top of the heap.

Think about how brutal he is to his wife and children in It's A Wonderful Life as soon as things start to turn ugly for him and he succumbs to the pressure.  Think about how he abuses that teacher on the phone.  He's not an ""everyman"".  He's a man who cracks under pressure and starts saying hurtful things to others, in that classic movie at least.  I don't give the character a free pass.  Faults are faults, and those aren't pretty.

Here in Shop Around The Corner he doesn't sink to those depths, but he is very sneaky, devious, almost wolfish in the way he treats the female lead, once he knows what she doesn't know, that she is the one he has been secretly corresponding with.  He isn't frank with her.  He strings her along, sets her up, keeps his secret, keeps his upper hand.  Because of this, I predict a messy divorce for them.

He is typecast, consistently, as someone who is cutting, tough, self centered, insensitive, yet at heart a pretty decent guy nonetheless.  If that qualifies as an everyman, I think our standards are too low.  He has a wolfish expression in his eye, not wolfish in the sense of girl-hunting, but wolfish in the sense of predatory.  He's a tough guy and he is perfectly capable of cutting you off at the knees.  His everyday charm belies his toughness, and he's simply not that nice a guy.

That said, I like this movie.  There is far too much butt-kissing of the boss, but that is to be expected in an old world movie.  I find it offensive but I'll let it slide.  The boss is no better than you are.  You don't have to brown nose him, and I find the practice offensive.  People brown nose their bosses in a totalitarian culture.  And Europe in 1940 fit the bill.  Yes sir, no sir, whatever you say sir.  In that sense, it was refreshing to see the All American Jimmy Stewart not being a yes man.  He was playing an American in Europe, whether he knew it or not.  He was the only one in the movie with an American attitude.  Good for him.  I don't mean to slam him, just to be accurate about him.

The female lead wasn't kind either.  This couple can't last.  They are both too high-maintenance, especially her.

I don't particularly like the way Jimmy Stewart teased her by saying that her blind date, her secret penpal and boyfriend, was poor, fat and bald.  Jimmy Stewart, by contrast, is a superior man, since he is not poor, fat, or bald.  I think that was typical of him, typical for the characters he plays, and would fit right in to a Coors commercial, a mysoginistic, self centered, juvenile, mildly offensive and unfunny Coors beer commercial.  Coors is as right wing as Stewart in real life, a pair of real neo-cons.

With all this negativity in my review, I am giving it an almost perfect four stars because it is a very good movie.  The Wizard of Oz is excellent in his role of store owner, and his character ends up being an awful lot more likeable and sympathetic than the two annoying lovebirds.  Even when he thinks that Stewart has seduced his wife and made a cuckold of him, he is unfailingly kind and considerate to him, in his speech and manner.  And he takes great joy in bringing happiness to others.  He is a true gentleman.  I like the way he values the opinions of his staff, the way he doubts his own infallibility and sincerely canvasses his staff for their true opinions.",1148083200,4,3980,4.395061728395062
399745,4,6301976045,"The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type of Hollywood screwball romance/comedy.

I usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple. The supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut.

Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career. He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him. That ""twist"" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind.

Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of that. In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I'll take this over the re-make ""You've Got Mail,"" any day. No comparison.",1145577600,6,1058,4.966101694915254

399806,5,6301976045,"Margaret Sullavan (playing Klara) and James Stewart (playing Alfred) is the duo to watch.  Margaret Sullavan was superb at delivering her lines in a soft,attractive way while revealing her helpless situation of clinging to her job despite her antagonistic relationship with her superintendant (James Stewart). James Stewart was so youthful and was perfect for portraying a first salesman who desperately wanted a raise and for apprarent no reason whose boss began to alienate him.

These two both anticipated for the first meeting with their penpal soulmate and an engagement over the weekend! The last diaglogue between the two was unresistably romantic and well crafted. At the end the reason Margaret gave to explain her previous attitude to James Stewart wrapped the whole story to a perfect ending.

In addition, the movie was set in a small department store in  Budapest at the era of depression where jobs were scare. Office politics, family affairs, friendship and support were intricately woven into the budding romance, making the movie wholesome.

Well, it is, but good ole Mr. Morgan provides that little extra which makes this film a classic---in my opinion, at least; disagree if you're so inclined after seeing this film, but do make an attempt to catch it, regardless.  The story is told above (and by other reviewers ad nauseum---amazing how many reviewers think they are the only one speaking of the topic at hand) so I won't go into the particulars of this film.  And while I'm in a critical mood, why does everyone have to compare this film to its remakes?  I, for one, hate remakes with a passion (James Mason's ""A Star is Born"" being the only remake as good as the original that comes to mind off hand).  Why even go see such commerical cash-cows?  Movie studios executives must be laughing to the bank everytime they put Jude Law, Brad Pitt---or whomever, in roles played by accomplished talented actors of the past.  So, what about this idea: If you have ever seen ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""The Good Fairy"" (wonderfully funny film with Ms. Sullavan and Mr. Morgan), or just relish the pictures made before WW2 especially, then do view this film when the opportunity presents itself.

For one thing, it's still the best-known of the four screen collaborations between the great James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, a delicate and endearing actress now known more for her brief, troubled life than for her performances. For another, Samson Raphaelson's script--based on a Hungarian stage comedy--provides lots of hearty laughs while remaining well-entrenched in a deep understanding of human nature. The characters are comic, but they never seem less than totally real. The story of Alfred (Stewart) and Klara (Sullavan), bickering shop assistants who don't realize they're each other's beloved pen pals, was remade a few years ago as ""You've Got Mail"" and turned into a musical, ""She Loves Me;"" but it also is mirrored in the tales of any number of sparring sitcom couples (Sam and Diane, David and Maddie, Dr. Joel and Maggie). The supporting roles are equally potent comic archetypes: Matuschek (Frank Morgan, the Wizard himself), the blustery, suspicious but essentially decent shop owner; the grandiloquent, treacherous Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut), Uriah Heep recast as a gigolo; Pepi (William Tracy), the brash, overambitious delivery boy; and Pirovich (Felix Bressart), the good-hearted average guy who wants nothing more than to stay out of trouble, but will stand up for his friends when he has to.

399873,5,6301976045,"1940's THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER has been remade twice; in 1949 with Judy Garland and Van Johnson in the musical adaptation IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and again in the late `90s in the internet-based YOU'VE GOT MAIL with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  They can remake it another dozen times.  It's hard to believe any will ever better this gem from director Ernst Lubitsch.
  Jimmy Stewart stars as Alfred Kralik, chief clerk at Matuschek's, a gift shop in Budapest.  Margaret Sullavan is Klara Novak, a feisty new hire.  Klara and Kralik seem to have only one thing in common - a vocal dislike for each other.  Of course they share one other thing - they are anonymous pen pals who have fallen in love with each other through the mail.
  THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is based on the play `Parfumerie' by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo, and its pedigree as a product for the stage shows.  Almost all action takes place within the shop. It is visually static enough to assume that this probably would have made a successful radio production.  That said, Lubitsch comes across with one beautiful shot that would have been impossible to duplicate on radio or in a theater.  Shot from the inner side of the post office boxes we see #38 being opened and a gloved hand feeling around the empty interior.  The hand is removed and Margaret Sullavan's disappointed face appears, framed by the open box.
  Lubitsch also has fun with the wonderful character actor Felix Bressart, who plays the wise and timid clerk Pirovitch.  The thunderous and intimidating owner of the shop, Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan - the wizard in THE WIZARD OF OZ), turns to Kralik a few times in the first half of the movie and begs his honest opinion on this or that.  Terrified that his opinion may be asked next, Pirovitch makes like a mouse caught out of the cabinet and Lubitsch catches him scurrying off-screen time and again.  This business sets us up for a later scene when Pirovitch confronts Matuschek and gives an unsolicited opinion in defense of his out-of-favor friend Kralik.  It's an ennobling moment, one of many in this fine movie.
  Stewart and Sullavan are convincing as a couple unknowingly throwing barbs at the object of their tenderest affections.  They are average enough looking to make the whole thing plausible - a couple of glamour pusses, say Cary Grant and Rita Hayworth, would have thrown the whole thing off.

The story: Stewart works as a head clerk in a store in eastern Europe. A new woman comes to work at the store and spoils Jimmy stewart days. At the same time, they are both involved in writing anonymous letters to each other and slowly fall in love with each other.
The movie is full of ironic situation and the entire cast that support Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan do a great job. Unlike you've got mail that tends to drag, this movie is full of energy and you can't see time go by.
When the two main characters finally discover their love for each other, it is the most poignant romantic scene i've ever seen. Any girl would want to be in Jimmy Stewart's arms at this point. He had a gift for really making you feel what the characters were going through, and in this case, you really feel the passion he feels for this woman.
I'm not into romantic comedies too much but if there's one to watch, this is the one, regardless of how old it is, the romance in it is timeless.",1076198400,5,1073,4.188405797101449

A beautifully crafted film, more complex than ""You've Got Mail"".  In addition to the romance between Klara Novak (Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (Stewart), the problems of the shop owner Matuschek (Morgan) add depth to the movie and make it more touching.  If you like this film, also see Lubitsch's ""Trouble In Paradise"", considered by many to be the best example of the Lubitsch touch.
Picture quality is excellent, but not flawless.  There are some film artifacts throughout, but they do not distract from the timelessness of this movie.",1056931200,14,696,4.974137931034483

But it was impossible for Hanks and Ryan to live up to the charm and allure of Sullivan or Stewart.

399937,3,6301976045,"Ernest Lubitsch made many a frothy film during his tenure, with a remarkably European flair (considering that none of his films were ever shot in Europe).  In ""The Shop Around The Corner"" he sets his sites on a Hungarian book shop in which two co-workers fall madly in love with one another through daily correspondence without realizing that their grandest amour is working next to them eight hours every day.  In fact, they hate one another while at work!  This is the film that proves opposites attract!  As the lovers, James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are an inspired team.  Though some of the acting that surrounds them has dated - badly - there's considerable magic left in this delightful romantic comedy from MGM.
Unfortunately, the film doesn't look quite as good as it might in this new Warner incarnation.  Though the negative has been cleaned up considerably in the way of scratches, chips and fading, there's nothing charming about the edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details that crops up throughout the film.  A few of the night scenes appear to have a ""duped"" quality with a loss of fine detail and low contrast levels as a result.  The audio has been nicely restored.  Extras are supposed to include theatrical trailers for this film and its musical remake ""In The Good Old Summertime"" starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson.  *One the former is actually included on the disc.

399938,5,6301976045,"This is a delightful vintage movie that has had several remakes, the most recent being ""You've Got Mail"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Having seen both versions, this 1940 film has got it beat. Beautifully directed by Ernst Lubitsch, this is a charming, romantic comedy that sets the standard for this genre of film.
The premise of the film is simple. In Budapest, Hungary, a young woman advertises for a pen pal, with the proviso that each are to remain anonymous. A young man responds to her ad, and they begin corresponding and fall in love through the mail. Unbeknownst to them,  these two amorous correspondents, Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) are co-workers in a leather goods shop owned by Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan of Wizard of Oz fame). Unfortunately, they do not appear to get along, and the words fly fast and furious between them at times.
There is also a strong sub-plot in this film, involving the cuckolding of Mr. Matuschek by his wife of twenty two years. It is a sub-plot that causes a greatly anguished Mr. Matuschek to turn on an employee whom he holds most dear. This sets in to motion a sequence of interconnecting events and revelations that work beautifully, setting the film for its final resolution between the two main protagonists, Kralik and Novak.
James Stewart gives a terrific performance as Kralik, the working stiff who is just looking for the right girl and finds her where he least expected. Stewart always shines when playing the classic Everyman. Margaret Sullavan, as Novak, gives a pert and sassy performance that belies her longing for romance in her life and for her knight in shining armor. Her sharp tongued banter with Kralik disguises an attraction that even she does not fully understand. As they say, there is a fine line between love and hate.
Frank Morgan gives a well-nuanced, scene stealing performance as Matuschek, the shopkeeper whose heart is initially broken on a number of fronts. In the end, he rights what went wrong and finds some surcease for his psychic pain by bringing some happiness to another person. Felix Bressart, as the kindly Pirovitch, Kralik's friend and co-worker, and Joseph Schildkraut, as the unctuous Ferenc Vadas, a co-worker whom Kralik detests, are also to be lauded for their performances. William Tracy, as the indefatigable Pepi Katona, the store messenger on the make, is absolutely delightful.
This is a masterfully directed film, with wonderful performances by the entire cast. It is a film to be remembered and added to one's personal collection. Bravo!",1045440000,172,2579,4.956120092378753
399939,4,6301976045,"Sometimes when watching films from the 1930s and 1940s, one must wade through long moments of awkward silence, offensive slapstick comedy, sexist attitudes and laughably bad dialogue. So it comes as a charming surprise when watching the 1940 romance ""The Shop Around The Corner,"" that this semi-classic has aged so well. The dialogue is crisp and sharp, executed with wit and pace. The acting is uniformly superb, as the handful of MGM professionals provide experienced dimensions to even the smallest of supporting roles.
""The Shop Around The Corner"" is indeed old fashioned, but in the most charming and pleasant of ways. Based on a play by Nikolaus Laszlo, the film weaves a comfortable tale in and around a Budapest retail store, where a handful of clerks show up each day for work. James Stewart, in fine form as usual, is the head clerk, serving as the silent and emotional leader of the shop. He states whats on his mind, goes about his day with silent professionalism, and has a father-son relationship with the store owner, played by legendary character actor Frank Morgan.
Margaret Sullavan is a fiery co-worker who argues constantly with Stewart, and their spirited repartee is the highlight of this film. Stewart, single and lonely, has an unknown penpal with whom he is slowly falling in love with. Eventually, he uncomfortably realizes this unknown friend is indeed Sullavan, and he must decide whether to reveal this to her, since she too has fallen in love with the mystery author of the letters.
Much credit for the delightful success of ""The Shop Around The Corner"" must be given to director Ernst Lubitsch, whose experienced hand keeps things moving along at a comfortable pace. Theater trained with a forte for romantic comedy, Lubitsch was most definitely in his element here. The dialogue is also the key, and viewers will laugh heartedly throughout this film. Of course, Stewart and Sullavan make a touching couple, independent and head strong to a fault. Viewers will long for this vibrant pair to finally admit their love for one another.
""The Shop Around The Corner"" set the standard, and it has been remade multiple times, most recently with the enjoyable (though inferior - did Tom Hanks have to be a multi-millionaire?) ""You've Got Mail."" I suppose my only complaint is the Budapest location for this story. With the exception of a few odd police uniforms and unique architecture, never for a moment do I truly believe this film takes place in Hungary. But that's small potates. ""The Shop Around The Corner is a lovely holiday charmer. Heartfelt and touching, it is truly an example of the old axiom, ""They don't make movies like this anymore.""

It was remade as You've Got Mail and In the Good Old Summertime, but Shop Around the Corner is far superior in every way and rather different. This movie is full of charm and humor. It makes a great Christmas movie and is highly repeatable. It is one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies.",1044489600,,357,4.3283582089552235
399941,5,6301976045,"In the 1930s and '40s, Ernst Lubitsch made some of the most charming romantic comedies ever made, including ""The Love Parade"" with Maurice Chevalier and ""Ninotchka"" with Greta Garbo, not to mention ""To Be or Not To Be,"" one of the greatest comedies of all time. His films had what was called ""The Lubitsch touch,"" a mixture of romance, comedy and social commentary that just plain sparkled.
In the midst of this streak he made ""The Shop Around the Corner,"" which has been overshadowed over the years by its remakes ""In the Good Old Summertime"" and ""You've Got Mail."" It is far superior to either.
Jimmy Stewart is Alfred Kralik, a clerk in Matuschek's leather goods store (nothing kinky, just luggage) in Budapest. Into his store walks Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan), who he thinks is a customer but really just wants a job. She gets hired, and quickly they get on each other's nerves. By sheer coincidence, they've been exchanging letters anonymously and have fallen in love without knowing each other's identity.
Around this main story is a tragic-comic subplot about Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan, of ""Wizard of Oz"" fame) suspecting his wife of being unfaithful with Mr. Kralik. The resolution of this plot is surprisingly somber, and in lesser hands than Lubitsch might have come off as melodramatic (just as the lovers' plot might have come off as far-fetched). But Lubitsch could mix the serious with the silly, and not shortchange either.
But what makes this movie interesting to me is the real-life story of Stewart and Sullavan. She met best friends Stewart and Henry Fonda when all three were members of the Cape Cod-based University Players. She would marry Fonda, but they would only stay together for two months. She and Stewart were in love for a time, and he reportedly carried a torch for her until his 1949 marriage. She married three more times and battled drug addiction and mental illness before committing suicide in 1960. But all that lay in the future when this film was made, and I take some consolation in the fact the sparks that fly between Stewart and Sullavan were based on real emotion.
As for this DVD edition, it would have been enough to have a ""bare bones"" edition of the movie. Instead, we have a feature (the 1940 MGM short ""The Romance of Sound"" -- not two features as the Amazon description might lead you to believe), and a great old-fashioned trailer (with Morgan in character). The only downside: If the trailers for ""In the Good Old Summertime"" and ""You've Got Mail"" are on the disc, as it says on the box, they are too well-hidden for me. Methinks someone goofed.
For lovers of classic movies, this one's a no-brainer.",1043625600,20,2660,4.784782608695652
399942,5,6301976045,"This is one of the most enthralling movies I've ever seen in my life and arguably, it's the best film that starred both Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who made three other pictures together (""Next Time We Love"" (1936), ""The Shopworn Angel"" (1938), ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940)).
Jimmy Stewart plays Mr. Kralik, the head clerk of the store owned by Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan in one of his best roles) and Maggie Sullavan is Klara Novak, who is hired by Mr. Matuschek as a salesgirl, just before Christmas....eventually, Klara and Kralik, develop a strong dislike for each other, unaware that they're pen pals..... the two leads' relationship is so sincere and real, and the events that lead to the conclusion of the movie, are so believable and expertly handled by the director, that make it stand apart from many other movies from Hollywood's classic era.
Joseph Schildkraut is excellent as the unpleasant Mr. Vadas, one of the most annoying characters ever, just the opposite of Felix Bressart, who plays the good hearted and reliable Mr. Pirovitch, both co-workers of Mr. Kralik and Klara. And let's not forget William Tracy's wonderful performance, as Pepi, the delivery boy.

399943,4,6301976045,"""The Shop Around the Corner"" is the first of three films based on the same story line.  (The others are ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson, and ""You've Got Mail,"" starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.)  This original version is, by far, the best of the three.
While the acting abilities of James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are legendary, it's the supporting cast that truly carries this film.  Frank Morgan (perhaps best known for his role as the Wizard of OZ) is marvelous as Mr. Matuschek, the shop owner.  Sara Hayden, Felix Bressart, and Joseph Schildkraut round out the principle supporting cast and all turn in wonderful performances.
If you're a fan of James Stewart or Margaret Sullivan you must see this film.  If you love romantic comedies, this is one of the best. And if you just want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie, watch this one and you won't be disappointed.",1033603200,59,910,4.734177215189874
400014,5,6301976045,"Recently, The Shop Around the Corner was remade as the more modern You've Got Mail. Although You've Got Mail was a pretty enjoyable movie, it certainly did not come close to the perfection of the original, made in the 1930s by Lubitsch, who was the master of romantic comedy. Overall, this movie is wonderful - charming, sweet, original and witty! It is one of my favorites.
Essentially, The Shop Around the Corner is about an ordinary worker at a small department store (Jimmy Stewart) who is looking for the perfect girl. He begins to correspond with a facinating woman by mail, without knowing that she is actually the new coworker at the store (Margaret Sullavan) he detests face-to-face.
With a cleverly original plot, lots of great dialogue, and wonderful performances by two classic stars, James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, The Shop Around the Corner is a must-see. It is a very enjoyable movie - perfect for the whole family - get it and enjoy!",1027123200,6,955,4.829268292682927

400016,5,6301976045,"In many ways, this is a very unusual Ernst Lubitsch comedy. Typically, Lubitsch was the unparalleled master of the sophisticated and elegant sex comedy--THE MERRY WIDOW, TROUBLE IN PARADISE, ONE HOUR WITH YOU, BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, even NINOTCHKA, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and TO BE OR NOT TO BE. The sex was definitely muted after 1934 and the beginning of the reign of the Hays office, but one suspects that even if Hays weren't censoring films (for instance, insisting exclusively on twin beds in movies, a double bed, in his mind, being far too suggestive), THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER would look pretty much the way it was made. If in his other films Lubitsch covers the sexier realm of romance, in this one, he explores romance based on mutual respect. Also, in this film the main characters are far less elegant and far more working class.  Instead of focusing on hoi polloi, the film deals with those who wait on them.
Perhaps because his subject matter is simpler than in his other films, Lubitsch engages in far fewer of the cinematic pyrotechnics he employs in his other films. The narrative here is far more straightforward. Like in most of his films, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is impeccably well cast, from the leads to the least of the supporting characters. Jimmy Stewart (did he make more first rate films than anyone in the history of cinema?) and Margaret Sullivan are outstanding in the romantic leads. Stewart was perfect for the role of head clerk.  It is hard to imagine Stewart playing a prince or a king, but no one played unpretentious, working guys better than Stewart.  Sullivan never had the kind of career her talent seemed to mark out for her, but THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER puts that talent on display and makes me regret she made so few films.  But for my money Frank Morgan, fresh off his reign as The Wizard of Oz, steals most of the scenes he is in.
This is just a great movie. Not perhaps one of Lubitsch's very greatest films, but one that shows that he was the greatest master of the romantic comedy of his or any other era.",1022284800,4,2057,4.581521739130435
400017,5,6301976045,"""The Shop Around the Corner"" is a film about people.  Simple everyday people, and just how colorful they can realy be. That romance plays a large role in the lives of people is, as far as this film is concerned, of no coincidence.  Set around Christmas, ""The Shop Around the Corner"" makes a wonderfully festive film, although it does not deal with Christmas directly.  But as Christmas brings out both the best and worst of people, it could not be a better stage for this delightful and touching film.  In the hands of a great director a depression ridden Budapest becomes a soft, charming heaven on earth.  And two ""psychologicaly very confused"" people become the luckiest on earth.
As it is nearing the Holidays, please, do not pass up this film.  Get as many people you love together, or perhaps best just that special one, and prepare to be introduced to a wonderful new Christmas tradition.",1008288000,,895,4.705128205128205

James Stewart is Alfred Kralik, a poor salesman working in a small shop in Budapest, Hungary. Working under Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan), he is the head salesman and his opinions are held in high esteem. One day though, jobless Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) comes to the shop to ask for a job. On that very same day Kralik and Matuschek had been having an argument on a cigarrete-music box. Kralik doesn't like it while Matuschek does but Klara shows her expertise by selling that same box at a very good price. From then on Kralik and Klara can't stand each other. Whether arguing about clothes, sales tecniques, or opinions on each other, it doesn't matter. They try to stay away from each. While at the same time, Kralik is having a great time corresponding with an anonymous woman and begins to fall in love with her. But when Kralik loses his job for almost no apparent reason on the same day he is going to meet with his mystery lover, he doesn't think he can face her.
A totally wonderful story with such a great cast, each and every actor and actress perfect for the parts they portray. With James Stewart (""It's a Wonderful Life"") as the quiet, responsible clerk Klarik, Margaret Sullavan  (""The Shopworn Angel"") as the fast talking, romantic Miss Novak, and Frank Morgan (""The Wizard of Oz"") as the demanding yet endearing boss.
But I think the most reason I love this movie is because of the fast-talking, witty humor. One of my most favorite characters is William Tracy as Pepi Katona, the delivary boy. I like the part where at the hospital, Pepi says, ""I would describe myself as a contact man. I keep contact between Mr. Matuschek and the customers. On a bicycle."" The doctor says, surprised, ""Do you mean you're an errand boy?"" Pepi then says haughtily, ""Doctor, did I call you a pill peddler?"" I also like Felix Bressart as Pirovitch, the clerk who always hides whenever Matuschek asks for ""an true and honest opinion.""
For those who love this movie I highly recommend ""You've Got Mail"" with great actor Tom Hanks and actress Meg Ryan. And for those who have seen ""You've Got Mail"", vice versa, you should see this movie. They're so alike, even some of the lines are the same!",1007769600,4,2356,4.62291169451074
400020,5,6301976045,"This is a very great artistic masterpiece.  At first I wanted to see it only because it had Margaret Sullavan.  As I've come to know it better, I've realized what a genius James Stewart was to have been able to do what he does here.  In one scene near the central climax, Frank Morgan says something to Stewart that is so completely unexpected (""I really believe that you'd be happier somewhere else"") that Stewart is rendered speechless for a few long seconds.  What he is able to express with his face during those seconds is miraculous:  incredulous near-amusement, an attempt to speak, a wave of anger.  Finally he finds his voice with the stunned ""do you really think so, sir?""  Then notice Morgan's sigh of anguish after he says ""yes, I...I'm sure of it.""  He's banishing his own son and heir, after all.
Something else to notice is the absence of musical underscoring.  The movie if full of music, but none of it is of the conventional film type:  Pepe's whistled tune at the very beginning, the tinkling Ochi Tchornya boxes (that rise to a cacophony at one point late in the film), clocks tolling the hour, and (in the magnificent centerpiece scene) the little cafe orchestra.  Even the ringing of cash registers on Christmas Eve is exploited for musical effect.  An obvious reason to avoid underscoring is realism:  shops in mid-1930's Budapest had no Muzak.  Less obvious is the structural purpose:  the relative starkness of the sound before and after it allows the centerpiece scene in the cafe to stand out like a musical oasis.  In other words, music takes on a richness and prominence in this scene that it does not have anywhere else in the film, and that is part of what makes this scene the centerpiece.",1002931200,8,1721,4.6866666666666665

The special chemistry of Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy Stewart plus a charming story set in a Budapest gift and leather goods store make this little 1940 movie a gem. As co-workers in the department store Klara and Mr. Kralik don't see eye to eye at all; it just so happens that they're also pen pals who are corresponding to each unknowingly and devotedly! Their performances are full of grace notes; when you watch later Stewart films, you may wonder what became of this other deft, sensitive, pre - drawling Stewart. As for Sullavan, this is a peerless performance: she makes the shopgirl's pretenses believable, lyrical and funny. The script by Samson Raphaelson is a free adaptation of a play by Nikolaus Laszlo, and although it's definitely a Hollywood Budapest we see, director Lubitsch sustains a fairly European tone. Frank Morgan shines in his interpretation of Mr. Matuschek. Granted, the story holds no real surprises, but it's presented with great style; no other movie of the love-hate genre has been made so convincingly. What's special in the experience of this comedy is how the jokes, reflecting on the characters' absurdity, keep shifting into something else, plus the story has the famed Lubitsch touch and few can deny the sincere heartfelt messages it conveys.",997228800,8,1361,5.0

It's perfect on all levels, the acting is great, Lubitsch's directing is always wonderful, the screenplay is heartfelt, funny, and charming. Klara Novak (Margeret Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) are both co-workers in ""Matuschek's"" gift shop in Budapest, Hungry. All they do is argue with each! Whether it's about getting out a little earlier, how to stock things, or even about the clothes they wear! But what they don't know is they are both pen-pals who correspond pseudonymous with each other. They each write to each other about cultural subjects, such as literature. After a while, they each start to write about love. And soon, even though they never met, they start falling in love with each other. But Lubitsch does just stop there with the story. There are many more sub-plots that take place that give the movie even more heart and sentiment. They're wonderful supporting characters to watch also, like Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), who always runs away and hides whenever the boss ask for someone's honest opinion  lol, and there's Hugo Matschek (Frank Morgan).

400039,5,6301976045,"This is my all-time favorite romantic comedy (and I am a veteran film fan). YOU'VE GOT MAIL is OK, but the modern film makers had to upgrade Hanks' character to make him rich and threw in unnecessary sexual  complications for both characters, thereby detracting from the main plot.  IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, the Judy Garland musical version of the same  plot, has the acrimony between the two main characters so strong that it is  completely unbelievable when they suddenly fall in love. Only this movie  has the perfect touch throughout. The makers of the stage musical, SHE  LOVES ME, wisely stuck with the SHOP AROUND THE CORNER plot and produced a  most delightful show. Stewart and Sullavan make a superb team, with just the  right balance in their developing relationship to make the ending not only  possible, but even inevitable. The supporting cast is nearly perfect,  especially the always excellent Frank Morgan. Felix Bressart, as Pirovich,  and Joseph Schildkraut, as the arrogant but slippery villain, are a delight  to watch. Don't just rent this movie--buy it! You will want to watch it  again and again. And each time will seem as fresh as the first, because  there isn't a false note in the whole film.",940118400,145,1223,4.87378640776699
