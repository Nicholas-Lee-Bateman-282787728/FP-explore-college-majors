4534106,5,B0053O89QU,"Anyone who watches ""The Middle"" knows what a brilliant series it is! This, however, is not a traditional review, which I will update at a later date. Instead, I am wondering why there is not a pre-order listing for this title. Warner Bros., the past two years, has at least let the fans know to expect a release, but this year, not so much. With release dates for other series in their library, like ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Mike & Molly,"" and ""Suburgatory,"" it baffles me why this series has heard no good news yet. I am dying to own this next season, which was fantastic, to say the least. I really hope something surfaces soon in terms of a DVD (even Blu-ray would be GREAT) for this series. It is truly underrated and deserves to be on DVD. Fingers crossed that an announcement is forthcoming!

UPDATE (6/12/13): The WB has announced that production of the season on DVD has begun, with a release date of October 8, 2013!!! I encourage everyone to immediately pre-order/purchase this new set upon its release date to encourage the release of future seasons! This is such a funny, poignant series that deserves every season released, and I would hate to see low sales for season three affect season four's availability. That being said, hopefully the fourth season will be released not too distant in the future!",1339459200,38,1314,4.663793103448276

It's so relatable that I think everyone can find themselves or their family member in some of the characters.  As the seasons go on, we've noticed more casual swearing, ""damn"", ""hell', 'ass"", which makes this a show for older kids, probably 12+.  Personally, I'd rather not hear it but the rest of the show is great that I chose to watch anyway. After  watching several episodes, I felt like I was hanging out in The Heck's living room while I watched this and found that so much of what happens in an episode could be taken right out of my life!  I highly recommend The Middle.  Give it at least 3-4 episodes before you decide.  It takes a few times to get the pace and humor.",1433548800,3,786,4.23489932885906

4534594,5,B0053O89QU,"The strongest season in this sitcom from ABC. The Middle continues to be good, whereas it had been great the first three seasons. Changing Frankie, the mom, from a car salesman to a dental assistant really blew the tires on this show. The loss of Chris Kattan is palpable, along with Mr. Ehlert and Frankie's co-workers including a voice heard only over the loud speaker in the car lot. Priceless. Season Three brings us some great moments, most notably in The Map which spoke to the loss of the Heck's  Aunt Ginny, reflecting the loss of the actress who played the part. Also, The Wedding, where the Hecks go crazy trying to fix up their house in one week for  Uncle Rusty's wedding, and The Play in which Frankie finds herself at odds with her daughter Sue when Sue is bounced from a community play and her mother has a supporting role. Season Three of the Middle is the classic season of a show that still warms the heart and tickles the funny bone. If you buy one season, I recommend Season Three. Better yet, get 1,2, and 3 for a real understanding of the genius of this quiet but plucky sitcom gem.",1426032000,,1104,4.433497536945813

Better late than never--I didn't even connect with this show until it was well into its 4th season (great promotion team for the show, whoever you are!  Not. ;-)  The combination of the lead ensemble of actors cast here (love 'em all, but Eden Sher as the endlessly upbeat ""Sue Heck"" is my favorite), plus the way the show uses so many great comedians of all types from other popular past TV shows (they show up as relatives, teachers, neighbors, car salesmen, dentists, even passerby) really grabs me.  And that's before I even comment on the writing.  Easily some of the best sitcom writing for TV, plus the editing and Patricia Heaton's ongoing voiceovers are a huge part of what makes it unique--and funny.  The show is often compared to ""Roseanne"" (which I also loved), but it really is one of a kind.  I've never experienced anything quite like it.  I love to laugh, and haven't found many recent series that really do make me laugh out loud, and ""The Middle"" does--often.",1401667200,,1180,4.666666666666667

Season 3's Christmas episode was superb - with Frankie (the wife) bugging bugging bugging her husband to get a dishwasher.

And it's hard to pick a favorite character.  I love Frankie, Mike and Brick (If I were ever going to have a kid, I'd love to have a kid like the Biblioholic Brick!) the most, but Sue and Axl add to the hilarity.

I'll be waiting in line to purchase season 4 when it's available.

4535144,5,B0053O89QU,"The Middle is one of the funniest comedies on television today.  A great send-up of the average American Family.  If you are raising kids in America today, here is a relatable family comedy.  Unlike many other family sitcoms with their huge houses and perfect lives, here are parents coping with real issues . . . in a believable manner!",1383177600,,337,4.677966101694915
4535145,5,B0053O89QU,"The Middle is, quite simply, a story about parents, children, and their everyday funny/sad/crazy/ordinary/extraordinary experiences.  It is also the absolutely funniest show currently on TV.  Although I used to like to eat dinner while I watched, I gave up this practice when I began to laugh so hard that I actually choked, and much to my dismay, missed the next few lines of dialogue because of prolonged coughing.  This was back in Season One (the ""Spelling Bee"" episode, to be exact) and I have been laughing ever since.

The actors, writers, producers, and all involved have found the perfect recipe for comedy by sprinkling a touch of sweetness---that ""aww"" moment--into each episode.  This particularly refers to Axl, the oldest son, who can be stubborn, irritating, clueless, self-centered, you name it, then turn around and do something that you never saw coming, and that will just melt your heart.  Mike and Frankie raised him right!

The other selling point is the great cast of revolving supporting characters.  The aunts, the Donahues, Rev. Tim Tom (and his guitar) and Brad!  The only way this show could be better would be to see more of Brad.

As much as most episodes make me laugh, the ones involving Mike and the quarry cats, and the aunt's 100th birthday, which I believe are both in Season Three, made me cry.  But that is okay...because it is what the Heck's life, and ours as well, is all about.  Laughing, crying, caring, trying, failing, and then trying again, knowing that our friends and family are right there to support us through it all.

October 8th is circles on my calendar...the day the Season 3 DVD will be available.  As Sue would say, ""Yay!""  The rest of the show speaks for itself.",1377216000,,1720,4.802721088435374

4535232,5,B0053O89QU,"It's here! It's here! Well, it's almost here...  I was extremely excited to see Season 3 of The Middle will finally be released. This is the best show on television and shamefully under-advertised by its own network, ABC. Season 3 was extremely funny, and I cannot wait to see it again!! Axl, Sue, and Brick are great characters who grow with each episode. They aren't just there to say a funny line and leave the room. Their stories have dialog and purpose, though it might not be the norm. The ending is not perfect in each episode, and neither are the characters. Neither are we, and that's what makes it real and perfect in my eyes.

I would encourage everyone to pre-order Season 3 in the hopes that they will also produce Season 4, eventually. If you are worried about getting a lower price, I got this message when I just pre-ordered: ""Our Pre-order Price Guarantee covers one or more item(s) in this order.

Compared to all the other crap on television these days, this show is smart, funny, well written, well acted and real.  Just hope the network execs and bean counters realize what a good thing they have here.  Glad to see there are others out there that feel the same way we do.",1374883200,,538,4.155339805825243

4535323,5,B0053O89QU,"You know all those over-hyped, supposedly 'edgy' and daring comedies the critics insist all discerning TV fans SHOULD love and appreciate? Well, The Middle isn't among them ;) But while critics have given the show a lukewarm reception, all of the actual TV viewers I know have been immediately charmed and delighted by this underrated gem of a show.

The Middle doesn't go out of its way to flaunt just how edgy and risque it can be. It doesn't, like so many other critically lauded shows, feature wholly unlikable people doing wholly unlikable things while half-winking at the camera over just how zany they are. It doesn't go for cartoonishly over-the-top wackiness or the kind of constant lowbrow sexual innuendo and fart jokes that you might unpleasantly associate with high school locker rooms.

Instead, The Middle simply tells the story of a family that's likable and even admirable despite also being realistically, hilariously flawed. The humor stems from the strong characterizations, sharp dialogue and the clever insight peppered throughout. (You'll be thinking ""that is so true...it's scary how well I can relate to that!"" at least a few times per episode). We get flashes of heartwarming poignancy here too, but rest assured that it's never too sappy or forced. It's quietly uplifting, but in a way that feels earned rather than manipulatively sentimental.

This is one of those rare shows that successfully blends humor with heart, and I was pleasantly surprised to realize just how much I've come to love spending time with this family. I used to have a weird visceral dislike for Patricia Heaton and, for reasons alluded to above, rarely like sitcoms...but this show immediately reversed my opinion of Patricia Heaton's acting abilities, and even gave me a renewed hope for the sitcom genre!

One major reason it's worth owning on DVD: The vast majority of the episodes not only hold up with multiple viewings, but actually improve, as you notice subtle moments of awesomeness that you were too busy laughing to pick up on the first time around. So many shows *claim* to have struck that balance between wit and poignancy; to have created lovable yet hilariously flawed characters; to have written dialogue that's sharp and memorable. This is one of the few shows that, in my clearly Middle-loving opinion, has actually succeeded in all those areas and more. It's a show that provides mood-boosting humor, a steady supply of heartwarming charm, and razor sharp insight into what it means to be part of a family. I can't wait to FINALLY get my fangirl hands on the Season 3 DVDs, and look forward to rooting for and laughing with the Hecks for many years to come!",1364774400,22,2679,4.946666666666666

4535329,5,B0053O89QU,"When The Middle premiered, we watched the pilot and thought it had funny elements, but we weren't sure about adding it as a regular show. A couple of years into the run of the series, we began to hear more and more of a buzz about it and then we saw a second episode while flying on a plane. My family is now officially hooked! The show has an excellent ensemble cast with clever and quick-witted dialogue. Neil Flynn from Scrubs and Patricia Heaton from Everybody Loves Raymond are so believable as a middle-aged, middle-class couple, living in the middle of the country who are trying to raise their three uniquely quirky kids while making ends meet.  Charlie McDermott, Eden Sher, and Atticus Shaffer all have show-stealing moments as their three kids. The supporting cast and guest appearances are an added bonus: Brooke shields as the white-trash neighbor is comedy gold, not to mention Marsha Mason and Jerry Van Dyke playing the parents of Heaton's character with John Cullum playing the hoarding father of Flynn's character. Additional hilarious appearances include Betty White, Norm MacDonald, and Dave Foley, as well as Everybody Loves Raymond alums Ray Romano and Doris Roberts in earlier seasons. Last, but certainly not least are Chris Kattan as Heaton's hysterically awkward, yet sweet co-worker and Brian Doyle Murray as her cranky and politically incorrect boss. It's uncertain how a show that has me laughing hysterically at one moment because of situations such as the mom inadvertently eating toe nails that her teenage son clipped into a chip bag, can still wrap up the episode with a poignant moment that makes me misty-eyed. Maybe it's because my oldest is a teenager so I'm frequently on the edge of tears, maybe it's because I am in the middle myself, but I think it's because I arrive at the same conclusion as the Hecks. In spite of the crazy times, it all goes by so quickly and I wouldn't trade a thing. If you aren't a believer after one episode, I recommend giving it one more try.",1360108800,8,2011,4.795389048991354

""The Middle"" is something the whole family can watch and laugh at! There hasn't been an episode that hasn't cracked me up.

Now I find out that there is no release date, as of yet.  I have not been able to see any of season 3 and am very disappointed.  I wanted my kids to get me season 3 for Christmas!!!!!

4535598,5,B0053O89QU,I just started watching Season 3 and I love the show even more than when I first started watching it.  It just gets better each season.  I hope this shows goes on for at as long as Everybody Loves Raymond.,1353283200,,205,4.1
4535599,5,B0053O89QU,"I love The Middle, a great funny show that the whole family can enjoy.  They deserve better, especially since they are not even mentioned for the Emmys.  Anyway, I need season 3 for a Christmas gift so please let us know if it will be out before Christmas!!",1353110400,3,257,4.333333333333333
4535600,5,B0053O89QU,"You see low morale and ethical shows like, Modern Family and other garbage like that released on dvd as soon as their season ends!  But! when it comes to something decent and safe for the whole family to watch Like The Middle, the studio is lame duck in releasing it. Seasons 1 and 2 were released fairly quickly after their seasons ended. This show has great characters and we as a family look forward to it every week, In reality it is the only show we watch on regular television ( the 3 big liberal networks, NBC, ABC CBS). Hopefully the show keeps its ethical and moral standards and doesn't slide into that big garbage dump called modern/ politically correct ( for the Obomanites) entertainment.",1352937600,2,701,4.608
4535706,5,B0053O89QU,absolutely my favorite show.  Each one of the characters is perfect in their roles. Can't wait for season 3 - please hurry.,1352851200,,123,4.590909090909091
4535707,5,B0053O89QU,"Please hurry and get the DVD for the complete 3rd season in stock!!!  This show never disappoints; all the actors and their characters are superb. And ditto for the writing staff.  I feel like I know Axel, Sue and Brick.  Each week, one or all 3 of them makes me want to either smack 'em or hug 'em. Mike and Frankie are so real -- at least to me.  Thank Heaven for shows like The Middle and Modern Family.  I've never enjoyed any other sitcoms like I enjoy these!  I notice neither show has one particular ""star""; all the actors work together seamlessly week after week.  Funny and classy -- no in-the-face gimmicks to lure viewers. Just great writing brought to life by great actors.  I LOVE WEDNESDAY!!!!!",1350345600,6,708,4.4765625
4535708,5,B0053O89QU,"This is one of the best shows currently on TV hands down. Season 3 was one of the best. I have been so looking forward to getting Season 3 on DVD only to find out there is no release date. Why??? Warner Bros. if you're reading this please release The Middle Season 3 on DVD. Per episode download is not the same!

Updated 3/19/13 - Still no actual release date but it's on the way and I pre-ordered my copy. Can't wait. Best comedy on TV since 2009.",1348358400,9,449,4.1022727272727275

4535711,1,B0053O89QU,"Its bad enough that I wanted to watch this episode in HD (hence paying EXTRA for it) but when I start watching it theres nothing but video that looks like 480p stretched and compressed until you're not sure what you're watching. It says my ""HD Connection"" is ""low."" Which basically means sorry about our crap-tastic connection to you, but heres an ""HD"" video that looks like someone recorded it with the first cell phone camera. For giggles I test my FiOS connection (25/15) and actually get 31/23. So, as I figured, its not my ISP. So I try to download it to watch it in the quality I PAID FOR and they won't even let me do that without installing software.... So I can buy items and use them, buy MP3s and play them where I want, but one damn show and I have to jump through hoops and install invasive software (I read up in it before I agreed to install it) to watch something I just paid for. Lesson learned. Ill NEVER purchase video from Amazon again.",1347926400,3,956,4.346368715083799
4535712,5,B0053O89QU,I am so disappointed that The Middle season 3 dvd has not been released yet. It doesn't make any sense. I bought the first two seasons on dvd and fully expected to be able to buy the third. The Middle is my favorite current TV show and season 3 was outstanding.,1347926400,9,261,4.137254901960785
4535713,5,B0053O89QU,"My daughter and I love ""The Middle"".  I am impatiently waiting for the dvd set because she wasn't able to watch this last season and I thought it was the best one yet.  It just keeps getting better. I have bought the past 2 seasons for her and she is anxious to own the 3rd season. No dvd release date yet?!",1347494400,13,307,4.016393442622951
4535714,5,B0053O89QU,I agree this series is one of the best series you can watch on TV.  I have been anxiously awaiting the release of Season Three.  When will it be available???,1346889600,21,157,4.2
4535715,5,B0053O89QU,"I love the series, ""The Middle,"" which has Patricia Heaton (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Neil Flynn (Scrubs) as parents of three precocious children in fictional Orson, Indiana. The show is far better than Modern Family which gets awards.

Maybe the show is a little too blue collar or set in the middle of the country but it's still one of the best comedies on television and in recent decades. Patricia Heaton should get more Emmys for her performance as Frances ""Frankie"" Heck and the same accolades for her onscreen partner, Neil Flynn as her husband, Mike Heck.

The actors who play the children are perfect. Charlie McDermott is a hoot as the oldest son, Axel, who takes off his shirt and clips his toenails in the chip bag. Eden Sher is wonderful as the always optimistic Sue Heck even in the worst of times. And I can't forget Atticus Shaffer as Brick, the boy who prefers books to anything else.

This season was great and I look forward to the fourth. Marsha Mason and Jerry Van Dyke play Frankie's parents. John Cullum returns as Big Mike and Norm McDonald plays Mike's younger brother, Rusty. All in all it's a great show that shouldn't be overlooked and should be released entirely on DVD like the first two seasons.",1341532800,52,1229,4.654377880184332
