7875604,2,6304682689,"This video is a fairly basic presentation of what ozone therapy is, how it is used, some of the history of its development, and methods of administration. The historical perspective is interesting, but beyond that I doubt there is much new here if you know anything about the subject at all. There is a general discussion of uses of ozone and different therapy modalities, but this is NOT a ""how-to"" film. You will still need a lot more information than you will find here in order to get started. They talk about how to choose an ozone generator, how to produce ozone gas, the oxygen source you will need and some of the diseases that have been successfully treated with ozone.
The interview format is used exclusively with an occasional photo or drawing. Interviewed are Dr. Zenon Gruber, a retired German doctor, Paul Von Shroven, a retired German naturopath, and Bob Graham, an Australian researcher.  All three men have heavy accents, and I found them difficult to understand. I had to continuously rewind the video to review what they had said. This is NOT easy listening. The content and subject matter are not the problem. The heavy accents and poor sound quality are the problem.",981072000,7,1188,4.795121951219512

It discusses the history of how this therapy developed, some case histories and some applications. The film treads softly but forthrightly when discussing the politics that works against the mainstreaming of this therapy. I am a registered nurse and I consider this video to be of a caliber worthy of recommendation to colleagues. At the same time it should be easy to understand by people without any healthcare training.",981072000,4,519,5.046511627906977
