7902266,5,0898706459,"If you are not familiar with the life of Saint Faustina than you are definitely going to want to purchase this DVD.  It says that I purchased a VHS but it was a DVD.  As always, the book is better than the movie but the movie reveals God's absolute desire to show us His continual mercy for us.
I personally own about 40 DVD's that are of the lives of the saints, the Catholic Church, several popes and I always feel the renewal of my faith and a desire to live a deeper and more profound walk with the Lord.
Is this movie worth buying - yes, but my favorite DVD is John XXIII, Starring Edward Asner, Claude Rich, Sydne Rome, et al. (2008).
May God bless you and allow this movie to transform your life.",1394409600,,703,4.161764705882353
