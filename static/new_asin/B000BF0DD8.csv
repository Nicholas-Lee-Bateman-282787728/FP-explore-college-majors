2415691,4,B000BF0DD8,"The acting, costuming and scenes are very good.
I learned something about the British Napoleonic wars that I didn't know
in the war in Spain. The action is a little gritty
and graphic at times, but it is a war movie.
I enjoyed it the first time I saw it and plan to watch it again now that
I know more about that time period.
I have to say that I wish there were more such
movies that teach while they entertain.",1248912000,2,412,4.036585365853658
2415692,3,B000BF0DD8,"Reading the Sharpe books before viewing the TV adaptations is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, if you've read the books you'll be better equipped to follow the much simplified plots - and characters. On the other hand, you may be disappointed with both. The story lines have been changed and rearranged to suit the time limitations of a visual medium, thereby losing much of the complexity of the books. With a few exceptions (notably Daragh O'Malley as a sympathetic Harper and Pete Postlethwaite, who is perfect as the twitchy Hakeswill) the characters have also lost depth. Some have been horribly miscast: David Troughton, as Sir Arthur Wellesley, comes across as a Monty Pythonesque ""upper class twit"" instead of the cold, calculating military leader portrayed by Cornwell. Brian Cox is a completely unconvincing Major Hogan, and, worst of all, Sean Bean, who can act when he feels like it, does not do justice to Sharpe. Bean reduces Sharpe's violent streak to mere bad temper and his simmering intensity to heavy breathing. What's more, the North Country accent really does not suit Sharpe (who is supposed to have been raised in the mean streets of London. In a later episode, that accent will come back to haunt him). In all fairness, a lot of the acting problems can be attributed to the writing. Of the first five dramas in the series, only Sharpe's Company, adapted by Charles Wood, captures the wit, the tension, and the spirit of the book. The other episodes fall far short of the original stories. However, taken on their own merits, the series provides for an entertaining evening.",1243468800,5,1610,4.858181818181818
2415693,3,B000BF0DD8,"My wife and I are Sharpe fans. Collected (and read) all the books so we decided to buy all the DVDs based on the reviews (many 5 stars).

I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality. I have an upconverting DVD player with Faroudja chipset and a PS3 with great upconverting capabilities. All my other DVDs look good (especially my superbit collections) but this looks terrible. It's almost as if the entire series was shot in very soft focus because it appears grainy and the upconverting doesn't work well with it.

Another thing I was slightly disappointed with was the DVDs plots/action do not really follow the books very well. Obviously it would be difficult to portray everything from the books but I felt that the writers could have included more.

For $240 (all 3 5 disk boxes) I feel a bit cheated due to the quality of the picture and sound but we are enjoying them very much (sometimes it's hard to get used to the picture but the series does a decent job of drawing one in) so I'd probably buy again. Hence the 3 star review.",1233446400,13,1046,4.523809523809524
2415694,5,B000BF0DD8,How good it is to see a period usually only covered by War and Peace or piratemovies. sharpe is quite the character and his lot of rifles are all still shots from English military in the ranks. Very enjoyable.,1211328000,,209,4.384615384615385
2415695,5,B000BF0DD8,"I enjoyed the Sharpe series as shown on PBS a few years ago on their ""Masterpiece Theatre"", but they only televised 4 episodes. Until recently, I hadn't realized how many episodes of ""Sharpe"" there were, but I was unable to afford the entire collection at USA prices. I went shopping in the UK, and discovered they had a complete collection at a fraction of the cost, and since I had purchased a region free DVD player, I knew I could buy the set from Amazon UK and enjoy the whole Sharpe saga.

The entire cast is magnificent! The amount of sword play, battle scenes, rugged terrain must have meant many hard filming days and nights, and an awesome stunt crew. The costumes as far as I can tell are spot on. Familiar faces appear in many episodes. Pete Postlethwaite as Obadiah Hakeswill is sooo evil. Daragh O'Malley is perfect as Harper. John Tams (who also wrote the music), Jason Salkey, Michael Mears & Lyndon Davies as the Chosen Men.  Assumpta Serna, Elizabeth Hurley, Alice Krige, and others, all excellent!

Sticklers for historical accuracy may not enjoy the series. I on the other hand had a fabulous time watching them. And I am positive you will also!",1174867200,9,1165,4.645631067961165
2415696,5,B000BF0DD8,"Sharpe heroic adventures in the first five stories introduce us to a British Soldier named Richard Sharpe. A Sergeant brought up from the ranks by Wellington to lead a elite company of riflemen during the Napoleonic campaigns in Spain. Sean Bean is Sharpe. Sharpe while fighting the French, facing rejection by the British officer class all the while finding love and adversity every step of the way. A rousing adventure for those who like swashbuckler type films.

The one thing one does notice in each of the Sharpe adventures. Sharpe (Bean) is usually hacked, shot, maimed in every battle it is a wonder that he can walk. But you have a good time cheering for this bloody hero you don't seem to care. You can't miss with this series!",1167868800,3,736,4.705426356589148
2415697,5,B000BF0DD8,"I became a recent fan of the book series and am working my way through them as I find the next in line in my local bookstores. I purchased the DVD set fully expecting to be dissapointed as it was hard to imagine how the many battle scenes described in such graphic detail in the books could be succesfully depicted with what I'm sure was a limited BBC budget.  Having now viewed all of the DVD's in this collection, and now part way through the subsequent 'Sword' set, I am far from dissapointed. The episodes are exceptionally well made and when based on a book manage to retain a remarkable amount of details from the written version.  The lack of massed armies on battlefields is very skillfully handled by the producers and very rarely is there any feeling of watching a budget movie, which is what the episiodes essentially are.  In fact in  many respects I find the scaled down action sequences to be a positive aspect as they can get a little tiresome in the books.  The acting is terrific from the entire caste, with some of the minor charactors often stealing the show.",1167868800,6,1078,4.507692307692308
2415698,5,B000BF0DD8,"Sharpe's Rifles is a wonderful series.  Sean Bean's portrayal of the character of Richard Sharpe is outstanding.  From the very first episode in the series you are hooked to this fast paced, action packed, consuming adventure revolving around the 'Choosen Men'.  There is a rich mix of characters all set against the back drop of the Napoleonic War. Sharpe's Eagle stood out the most. The title soundtrack is exceptional.  Enjoy!",1163030400,3,429,5.085714285714285

2415700,5,B000BF0DD8,"What great fun.  Sharpe's Rifles, starring Sean Bean, is full of adventure, suspense, action, and a little romance centered around the Napoleonic Wars during the early part of the 19th century.  Sean Bean is great!  The whole series is fun.",1372032000,,240,4.95
2415701,5,B000BF0DD8,"My dad loves this series.  I originally bought the series for him on VHS 15 years ago.  He wore them out, so I was so happy to find them in DVD format.  Was a huge surprise for him on Christmas",1370908800,,193,3.775
2415702,5,B000BF0DD8,"I first saw the series when I was a kid, and it stuck with me ever since. 14 episodes in all, I've always considered these to be classic historical romantic adventure films. Sure they follow a rather simple plot scheme just like the books, but each has just enough variety to it to make it enjoyable. No great special effects, no big name actors, but simple and enjoyable stories that I've rewatched over half a dozen times.",1367107200,,424,4.51948051948052
2415703,4,B000BF0DD8,"Fun to watch after reading the books. I wish there had been more funds available to make it more authentic- more people, bigger armies, etc.  Fun nevertheless",1364601600,,158,4.851851851851852
2415704,3,B000BF0DD8,"Yes, I bought into the Sharpes craze and ordered several seasons of this series.  Having read the other reviews I thought it might be interesting and fun to watch.  I don't understand the 'Sharpes Fever' that seems to be going around.  The series is, unfortunately, quite hokey in my humble opinion.  The acting left something to be desired, and if your desire is to simply watch some attractive folks on the tv screen and you are not concerned with the hokey plots or poor acting this should suffice nicely.  Yes, I know it is an older series and the standards were different then from now, but hokey is hokey there is no getting around it.  I do enjoy the more vintage series shows, but this is simply not one of them.  Still have not finished the set and probably won't, just uninspired all around.",1363824000,,801,4.520833333333333

2415707,5,B000BF0DD8,It has Sean Bean in it!!!!! I don't need to say any  more!!!!  A man who rose from the ranks to Lt. Colonel.  This his journey through the British army starting 1809 to 1815.  I would love to see more of Sharpe after he  leaves the army.,1356652800,,237,3.9574468085106385
2415708,5,B000BF0DD8,"I've read several of the Sharpes books and these dvds capture much of the sense of adventure. Sean Bean is great as Richard Shape and I also like the choice of the actor (Daragh O'Malley) playing Patrick Harper. I run a Military History Club for students at the high school where I work. This series makes a good introduction to the Napoleonic wars, and has even convinced some of the kids to study the era in more detail.",1353110400,,422,4.423076923076923

2415710,4,B000BF0DD8,"The show is great, the main character is a loveable rogue played by Sean Bean, not sure anyone else would have done it justice. The DVD quality is a little grainy though, i wish it was on BlueRay or at least better quality.",1336608000,,223,4.209302325581396
2415711,5,B000BF0DD8,"This is a great series, This a story about a common english soldier who rose from the ranks who was not treated as a real officer, one who did not buy his commisson. I couldn't stop watching it, I have bought all of the Sharpe series, this one shown here is not as complete as buying the sets. This part was made for Sean Bean, I wish there would be a finale as to his daughter. Assumpta Serna was terrific also as well as Daragh O'Mally and all the fine actors "" The Chosen Men"" all well cast in their parts. War, some humor, love and the trust of his men. I enjoyed the history. I seldom like movies with war but this is a series not to miss. Sean Bean also starred in ""Game of Thrones"" season one on HBO. You're better off buying the sets such as those listed below, more programs on these. Also the last two are Sharpe's Peril and Sharpe's challege sold individually at present. Tho some reviews say the history has its errors,as well as USA series. I didn't mind, I loved the entire series.

Sharpe is a nco, and being in that time, if you were not an officer, you were dirt. So sharpe had to do what he had to do, and he did, and in saving the """" (won't disclose) he was promoted to an officer! Wow, now he had to change, but he didn't really, because of his background, so the story continues, with his saving so many in so many ways, yet staying true to himself, and those who he, allies himself with.

There are exceptions, like Lost and Heroes, but when you want adventure in a world of war in Europe, Sharpe is the standard.  This is the first set in the series.
