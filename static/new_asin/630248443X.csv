472475,4,630248443X,"Robert Mitchum plays a practical, no-nonsense farmer recently reunited with his young son, Tommy Rettig.  They rescue a young couple (Marilyn Monroe and Rory Calhoun) going on a raft down a river by their homestead, and that's where the trouble begins.  Calhoun is out to make a gold claim, and he'll do anything, including stealing Mitchum's horse and gun, leaving Mitchum, Rettig, and even Monroe behind to face the Indians without any defence.  So they must take to the raft to survive, and that's where the adventure begins.  I liked this film a lot.  Mitchum is his usual laconinc self, but it works really well with this character.  Monroe gets to act in this film, and she does so very well, playing a saloon singer that wants to defend her man, despite what he has done to all of them.  Young Rettig is good too, not cloying and irritating like so many child actors can be.  The scenery is beautiful, the title song very effective, and although the direction of Otto Preminger isn't very fluid and sometimes the movie lumbers from one scene to another, the performances and relationships among the characters make up for it.  Viewers will enjoy the trip down the River of No Return.",996364800,19,1190,4.7101449275362315
472476,3,630248443X,"Marilyn is so beautiful in this movie.  While the movie itself is not her best, she is just so amazingly gorgeous in it.  Like the scenery itself. The story isn't very good, but to see Marilyn perform ""One Silver Dollar"" ""I'm gonna file my claim"" and ""river of no return"" and a sweet ""down in the meadow"" it's worth buying!  she does act decently in this but it's hardly her top acting. The little boy is very good too.",990144000,4,419,4.2784810126582276
472477,3,630248443X,"Mitchum rescues Calhoun and Marilyn from a leaky raft; Calhoun returns the favour by stealing his horse and abandoning them (along with Mitchum's young son) to hostile Indians. This film isn't great by any stretch of the imagination, yet it presents the 27 year-old Monroe at her most beautiful. While the dialogue in this film leaves something to be desired, (Monroe herself was not pleased with having to do this film - she thought she deserved better material by 1954)  the chemistry between Monroe and Mitchum is very evident and the gorgeous Canadian Rockies scenery is breathtaking in Technicolor.",958694400,17,603,5.090909090909091

472799,1,630248443X,"Gave up in disgust halfway through. At first I found it okay. A decent (if stereotypical) old Western, with some pretty scenery and nice chemistry between Mitchum and Monroe.  It was also nice to see Monroe get a chance to act.  However about halfway through the film there's a scene where Mitchum attempts to rape Monroe.  An unrelated attack prevents him from carrying through with the rape, but it completely soured me on the movie.

I'm not a delicate flower who can't stand the thought of rape;  I enjoy A Game of Thrones quite a bit.  But in AGOT rape is always portrayed as a bad thing.  A thing that villains do -- not your hero.  A woman who's threatened with rape is upset.  She's not disappointed (as Monroe obviously was) when the rape gets interrupted.  And she sure as hell doesn't fall in love with her attacker.  I know that violent ""seduction"" was a trope in 50s film.  ""No"" meant ""yes.""  ""Good"" women fought when a man tried to kiss them -- and a ""real"" man wrestled her into submission and kissed her anyways.  But even by the sexist standards of the 50s, this was an appalling scene.  A woman fought, tooth and claw, to protect herself and the ""hero"" threw her to the ground and climbed on top of her.  This scene made me unable to root for, or like, any of the adult characters.",1470009600,,1299,4.417721518987341

472848,5,630248443X,"Last night I watched this on a whim. I chose it because I'd never really watched a Marilyn Monroe film, and if Robert Mitchum is in it, it couldn't be that bad.

Well, what a great choice! RM plays a farmer in the Pacific Northwest who, as the movie opens, is looking for his son after having paid someone to get him. A man with a past, all he wants is to raise his son and work the land he claimed. The boy wants to say goodbye to the saloon singer who has been kind to him (MM). She is convinced by her smooth-talking gambler boyfriend to leave for Council City, but the way there has to be taken by a raft on what is known as ""The River of No Return."" They get caught up in dangerous rapids and are rescued by the farmer; the boyfriend rewards him by stealing his horse and gun. Together, the farmer, the saloon singer and his son embark on an adventure to get back what was stolen, but they gain much more in the process.

RIVER OF NO RETURN was excellent storytelling. A small, tidy cast, characters you can't help but care about, and two stars with wonderful chemistry between them. As another reviewer noted, Marilyn Monroe wasn't a doll in this, but rather this vulnerable, tough but kindhearted woman. Robert Mitchem has always been a favorite of mine, so I would love him in whatever he does. Really loved this and would watch it again!",1467590400,,1346,4.316205533596838

473543,5,630248443X,"Robert Mitchum doesn't have to say anything to be a great actor. His force of personality suits the roles he plays to a T. And as far as acting goes; how many men can spend 99% of their time acting as if they are not attracted to Marilyn Monroe. And of course the ending could never have been anything else. The scenery was magnificent, the Indians were poor shots and his son was a good one. What more could you ask for?",1451001600,,421,4.146341463414634
473573,4,630248443X,"I enjoy the time period in which this film was released.  I also like Marilyn Monroe.  Although in this one, her singing is particularly bad.  Nevertheless, she has never looked more beautiful than she did in this one.  As stated in other reviews, Robert Mitchum and Monroe have great chemistry, Rory Calhoun.....not so much.  Can't see what the Monroe character ever saw in the man, myself.  Mitchum's redemption in the eyes of his son come full circle in a not so unexpected moment when he too shoots a ""snake"" in the back to save his father (as his father did years before and ended up serving time in prison for it).  All of the threads were tied up.  The anti-heroine (Monroe) gets the anti-hero (Mitchum).  The boy gets a new ""Mom"" (The loving prostitute as played by Monroe).  What's not to like?  Happily ever after.  They don't make them like this anymore.",1450656000,2,865,4.618421052631579

473577,4,630248443X,"River of No Return was a 1954 Western Directed by Otto Preminger, starring Robert Mitchum, Marilyn Monroe, Rory Calhoun and Tommy Rettig who I remember best as Jeff in the CBS's Lassie television series, from 1954 to 1957.

I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.  I liked Robert Mitchum ever since I saw Thunder Road in 1958, but I never thought Marilyn Monroe was a very good actress.  She herself said that her worst acting was in that movie.  Although I disagree, her acting in this movie gave me a new respect for what she was capable of.  The movie had some beautiful scenery and was filmed in Canada, Idaho and Los Angeles and was set in the late 1800s.

My overall opinion of this film was that I liked it, except for some excessive river rafting scenes that got a little boring at times.  I give it 4 stars, or a grade of B-.",1449360000,8,844,4.30379746835443

Very fun old movie, get a copy and give it a try, I think you will like it, just keep in mind that there is not sex or gore in these old movies, in fact that is one of the things that is so appealing to me, nope I don't need all that crap in my movies, doesn't do anything to make them fun to watch, nor does it add to the story, just a lot of nonsense and crap that pulls the mind and spirit down, and this is where the older movies had it all over the new stuff.  You could take the whole family to most of the movies that came out back when I was a kid, and they are still that way today.

She was sensitive, emotional and it did not seen like she was acting, but just being real. I saw all the Marilyn Monroe movies but River Of No Return opened my heart to Marilyn.
  Robert Mitchum Played a great role, especially in the end when he picked up Marilyn and carried her out of a lounge where she was a singing and his son and her were hugging knowing they were going to be together. The boy needed a mom and Marilyn needed a family, which made me feel emotional and happy at the same time.

473646,4,630248443X,"Last time I saw this movie was at a Cinema probably when it was doing the rounds, seeing come up
on the Blu-ray format a while back, I had to buy it, a nostalgic trip back perhaps to yesteryear.
'Matt' (Robert Mitchum) now a widower sends for his 9-year old son 'Mark' (Tommy Rettig) that he'd
not seen for many moons, he'd actually been in Jail.
In this 'rough' mining town, young 'Mark' had been left to find his own way around the strange town by
the man his father had paid to bring his son to him.
'Kay' (Marilyn Monroe) a dance-hall singer befriends young 'Mark' prior to his father locating him.
'Matt' unlike those in town searching for 'Gold' owns a Small - Holding and farms to make a living.
'Kay' who is seemingly married to two-bit gambler 'Harry Weston' (Rory Calhoun) become stranded
on the River out of control on a 'Raft' 'Matt' rescues them.
The gambler turns on his rescuer stealing 'Matt's' horse leaving his victim for dead, 'Kay' stays behind
needing to know the farmer is okay.
However perhaps staying behind wasn't a great idea, the local 'Indians' are getting restless, 'Matt' and
his Son along with 'Kay' escape by climbing onto the 'Raft'
The river with it's raging rapids hold much danger for the three, they will also encounter a couple of
dangerous drifters as well as 'Indians' on the journey.
At the Town they are hoping to reach, 'Matt' hopes to come across the 'Gambler' that had stolen his
horse, trouble is how will 'Kay' react if she see's 'Harry' again.
It's actually a decent story, if but a little predictable, good 'River' sequences through the 'rapids' great
scenery, and some decent action moments along the way, the film is a lot better than my memory served,
perhaps as a child I'd hoped for more action than the film actually delivers, years on. I enjoyed the film
for it's story-line.
Of course there is also the bonus of two 'Hollywood' legends in 'Marilyn Monroe' and 'Robert Mitchum'

This is the river now caled the Salmon River in central Idaho that stopped the Lewis and Clark expedition and caused them to vere many miles off their course and take a more northerly route around this raging river. This is also the film that caused bad blood between the director and Marilyn Monroe and perhaps the first time she was labeled difficult to work with. She insisted on bringing her drama coach along to the production set and listened to her coach more than the director on how she delivered her lines. Her co-star, Robert Mitcham was drinking heavily by this point in his life which also took its tole on the director who didn't want to do the picture in the first place but was under contract to the studio. Despite all of these challenges for the director it is a film that still holds up today and Miss Monroe is always a complete pleasure to watch.",1425945600,3,956,4.468571428571429

473784,5,630248443X,"W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L-!! A delicious, heart-warming musical western with Marilyn Monroe at her most beautiful! This is one of my favourite films. Below, more of my impressions with some SPOILERS.

Northwestern USA, 1875. Matt Calder (Robert Mitchum) is a man of few words, tough as nails and very discreet about his shady past. He was for many years estranged from his family and his wife died in the meantime. Now he finally reunites with his 10-years old son Mark and is firmly decided to become a honest farmer. A sudden Indian war will force him to abandon his recently build home and run (or rather navigate) for his life, in company of his son and Kay, a saloon dancer (Marilyn Monroe) - and the only way to escape is through a wild, deadly waterway local Indians called River of No Return... This film tells the story of this desperate wilderness travel by those three very different and ill assorted people...

Made in 1954 and directed by none other than Otto Preminger for whom it was, I believe, the first and only western in his career, ""River of no return"" is an exceptionally beautiful, enchanting film. The river itself provides a lot of magic, as it is simply majestic in its calmer parts and terrifying when it speeds up and shows its anger and might. Even more magic is added by the ""river call"" - a discreet eerie song heard every morning, to mark the beginning of a new day and of a new chapter in the wilderness travel. We can indeed hear this river call us...

For my personal taste this is the film in which Marilyn Monroe beauty shines THE MOST! She is of course extremely sexy in scandalous saloon dancer outfits and red ""do me"" high heels, but somehow she is even MORE sexy simply barefooted, in jeans and a man's shirt - and when at one moment she wears a rag tied with a piece with rope, well, it doesn't hurt her beauty and sex appeal either... NOT. A. BIT. And then there are of course the songs - mostly saloon songs, which are really GREAT but also one good night song for children - and with that one she manages to hit even harder.. err, I mean hotter...)))

There were of course women more beautiful than Marilyn Monroe in Hollywood (Veronica Lake comes immediately to mind) - but none of them had this kind of supernatural sexual magic. There was only one Marilyn - and there will never be another one... And in this film she is simply at her most magical beautiful moment.

Robert Mitchum's character is in fact even better as he was created into a completely exaggerated superman on purpose - and somehow, rather than being annoying or ridiculous it actually WORKS! Matt Calder is an increased uber-macho on steroids who has deep moral principles and is also a super dad! He shoots dozens of Indians with a single bullet (OK, maybe with two bullets), he crushes jaws and skulls with his mighty fists, he saw it all, knows it all and has a solution to its all, he is friendly to the people of good will but merciless to the villains, he can tame the wildest river and the most ferocious wilderness, he will bring meat to his woman and child even if he has to struggle with wild beasts bare handed - but then he will not take no for an answer and will drag the woman to his den by her hair if necessary...)))

Amongst the greatest treasures of this film are a permanent, steamy, sizzling hot sexual tension between Matt Calder and Kay and also the incredibly shocking final shootout (well, it is a western, so there has to be a final shootout) and especially the incredibly shocking solution of this final shootout.

It must be also said that this film and ESPECIALLY its last scene will cause any feminist who watches it to screech like a banshee - then her body will desintegrate into dust, like that of a vampire exposed to sun, and her suffering soul will then forever haunt some desolate wilderness, probably on board of River of No Return...)))

Robert Mitchum is superb as Matt, and Marilyn is mesmerizing in her painted on jeans and camisole. I am not a big western fan, I can only think of a handful I truly love.. . but this one ranks right up there. The only thing that struck me as a little silly was how Marilyn's lipstick, eye shadow and mascara never got smudged.. not thru Indian attacks, riding the rapids or wrestling with Mitchum..
This is also one of the most romantic movies.. the scene in the cave, where he warms her up with that massage, the ending, when he carries her out of the saloon, and how she throws away her prize possession.. those Red Shoes, because she finally knows she will never need them again.. A movie that I can watch over and over and never tire of...",1406592000,,886,4.441717791411043

473875,5,630248443X,"Marilyn's first movie from 1954. That year saw her marriage to Joe DiMaggio start/end and entertain the troops in Korea (Feb). This was Marilyn's only western she ever made and I consider it to be one of my favorites of her movies, although she never really cared for it. Her and the director Otto Preminger did not get along well. Despite being injured on the set and doing her own stunts, she did a great job and gave it her all.  She looked beautiful in the movie and her singing numbers were good as usual, especially ""File My Claim"" in the beginning. I thought her, Robert Mitchum, and Tommy Rettig got along well together. Rory Calhoun plays Kay's (Marilyn) boyfriend partner as they head for a ""stakeout claim"" of Gold. They embark on a river raft that leads them to Matt Calder's (Robert Mitchum) farm. The river is too much for them and they have to disembark. Once aground, Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun, ""How To Marry A Millionaire"") takes Matt's rifle and ""borrows"" the horse and then sets on a mission to get to Council City to file the claim. Kay is left behind to tend to Matt and the kid as they, too, have been forced to leave by native Indians. Taking the raft left behind and with little things, they start on a treacherous journey on the RONR to Council City.
The DVD edition looks good and sounds good. I highly recommend this movie not only because you are a fan of Marilyn, but a fan of Westerns, too.

473907,5,630248443X,"I was never one for Western movies as i always found them so boring. Well if this movie was never created I may still have that same attitude. First and foremost i am a HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan. The woman was more beautiful then any star in her day. She was not only sexual she was innocent and usually the two don't mix. You are either one or the other and Marilyn had them both. Filmed in Technicolor the woman was obviously flawless. She could light up any screen. She plays Kay, a saloon singer with an incredible body! She gets mixed up with Harry Weston(Rory Calhoun) who is into gambling and making his fortune in Gold. They escape to file his claim on a raft only to be saved by Matt(Robert Mitchum) and his son Mark. Soon trouble starts and Kay Matt and Mark find themselves alone, without a horse and trying to escape the Indians on the Raft that Matt originally saved Kay and harry from. Marilyn was the first woman to be filmed in Levi Jeans and did they fit well! Even as a Marilyn fan I won't say it is her best work, but it far from her worst. Marilyn wasn't pleased doing this film(but no one in those days were happy doing Westerns as they saw it as a way to damage their careers) but this is a good western. The chemistry between the triangle of Marilyn, Mitchum and Calhoun is obvious.  She was a much better actress then many want to give her credit for. She played her roles well and the camera loved her, especially in this film.",1394323200,,1450,4.2727272727272725

Based upon today's societal morals, values and beliefs, the acting seems a little cheesy at times.  It's necessary to get in the right mindset; this is not a modern day film.  However, I enjoyed the trip back into time, when the world was certainly a different place.  The film location of Banff National Park (Alberta) was spectacular.  The film opens with Robert Mitchum chopping down a tree on the mountainside overlooking his log cabin and the Bow River valley, and you wonder why he's not chopping down a tree closer to the cabin!  Hey, it's a filming oppertunity to show off the scenic beauty of Banff NP!  Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe's raft trip down the Bow River is a scenic gem.  The movie is certainly worth a watch.

This is an enjoyable movie to watch. Love Marilyn movies. Can't keep my eyes off the screen, especially when she is in the scene. Most scenery shots look really good, but the studio river shots with the river on what looks to be a screen in the background, look like dvd in the background & blu-ray up front. Not that many of these scenes but overall really nice Blu-ray I think. I am temporarily listening through just my tv speakers, so no high tech audio system analysis here although it sounded ok to me.

473976,5,630248443X,"River of No Return is a great western, combining a credible story line with plenty of action, suspense, and sentiment.

I recently read a book about Marilyn Monroe. Supposedly, this movie was her least favorite and she is reported to have commented that if she could turn back the clock she would refuse to make this picture. From the list of Monroe movies, I would rate River of No Return as one of the better ones.

Marilyn, according to the biography, was displeased from the beginning with the plot. She could not understand a saloon singer caring for a little boy that is not her own, believing this scenario would never happen.

From my perspective, the writer(s) likely worked this into the script early to show the audience that despite everything Marilyn (playing Kate Weston) basically is a good person, caring for a pitiful child that could not do anything for her in return. She seems to genuinely care about the little boy Tommy Rettig(plays Mark Calder), even before falling in love with his father, Matt Calder.

Her two adult co-stars, easy-going Robert Mitchum (plays Matt Calder) and handsome Rory Calhoun (plays Harry Weston) are good actors and are believable in their roles. Who can ask more of actors than that? I also liked the theme song, rendered beautifully by Tennessee Ernie Ford.",1373760000,,1308,4.852017937219731

Written by Frank Fenton
Based on a story by Louis Lantz ""who borrowed his premise from the 1948 Italian film The Bicycle Thief'
Starring Robert Mitchum, Marilyn Monroe, Tommy Rettig. Rory Calhoun
Music by Cyril J Mockridge, Cinematography by Joseph LaShelle
Editing by Louis R Loeffler

<<<Matt Calder, who lives on a remote farm with his young son Mark, helps two unexpected visitors who lose control of their raft on the nearby river. Harry Weston is a gambler by profession and he is racing to the nearest town to register a mining claim he has won in a poker game. His attractive wife Kay, a former saloon hall girl, is with him. When Calder refuses to let Weston have his only rifle and horse, he simply takes them leaving his wife behind. Unable to defend themselves against a likely Indian attack, Calder, his son and Kay Weston begin the treacherous journey down the river on the raft Weston left behind. Written by garykmcd (IMDb)>>>

It must have been the male team - Gable, Clift, Wallach - that wrecked the performance of Monroe in The Misfits - here, against Mitchum as an able, albeit laconic actor, she does well - actually, both do well. The story is otherwise quite thin, though the breathtaking Canadian wilderness and the white water rafting carry the film quite well. The analogy to the de Sica's Bicycle Thief is far fetched. For Preminger, this is a relievingly undercrowded event.

474047,4,630248443X,"Marilyn Monroe was one-of-a-kind. She was to women what, say, Elvis was to men. She's the quintessential example of feminine beauty and charm. Unlike many too-thin women today, Marilyn had the necessary curves that drive men wild. Speaking of which, she looks great in this movie throughout, whether in semi-tight jeans or saloon-dancer apparel. Robert Mitchum, of course, was no slouch either when it comes to being a model of masculine strength. And neither was Rory Calhoun, who played the great white hunter, Jonathan Kincaid, in that memorable episode of Gilligan's Island.

These three, especially Marilyn, are what make ""River of No Return"" (1954) worthwhile, along with the stunning location photography, shot in Banff and Jasper National Parks, Canada.

The plot revolves around the two stars and their attempt to travel a river on a big wooden raft so they can meet up with the gambler (Calhoun) who stole the Mitchum character's horse and rifle. His young son tags along for the ride.

Unfortunately there are some roll-your-eyes moments typical of old Westerns that might tempt modern viewers to tune out, like the Natives' utterly stupid attacks on the raft, but they're just there as a story device to create suspense anyway.

The script is generally weak since the story's not all that compelling, except for a chance meeting with hunters in the forest and the closing scenes at the town on the river, but -- like I said -- Marilyn and the scenery make up for it.

The film runs a short-but-sweet 91 minutes.

474054,4,630248443X,"RIVER OF NO RETURN is absolutely visually stunning with the rich colors of cinemascope. The beautiful scenery and landscapes make the movie worthwhile but add in Robert Mitchum, Marilyn Monroe and Rory Calhoun and you have quite the cast.
Althouh the story is weak, it is a joy to see these great actors together in their prime. Why do I say Marilyn Monroe is restrained? This is early Marilyn before she ""perfected"" her breathy voice and sexy demeanor. Kay (Marilyn Monroe) is a saloon singer who just wants to make an honest living. It's not her fault that she is so beauiful and falls in love with sleazy gambler Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun). Beauty meets trouble.
Here is a young Monroe at the beginning of her career as a star. She is unconventionally beautiful but there is a innocence around her. Her talking voice is normal. She is just a nice gal in a rough western town.
Kay and Weston's paths collide with widower (and recently freed from jail) farmer Matt Calder (Mitchum) who has just be re-united with his son Mark (Tommy Rettig). It's a chance to make up on lost time and to live a simple life as wheat farmers in dangerous Indian territory.
Weston steals Calder's horse and gun and leaves him stranded and without protection. He even leaves Kay behind. Who would leave Marilyn Monroe behind?
The Indians attack and the Calders and Kay have only one chance for escape - on a raft down the raging ""river of no return.""

Although the scenery and cast are A+, the story is weak and predictable but yet engaging because of Mitchum and Monroe. It's not hard to predict where the story will lead and how it will end but there is enjoyment in the journey. I am a new appreciation for Robert Mitchum--ruggedly handsome and usually a good but troubled character. Monroe--always the vulnerable waif--shows so much potential as an actress in this film. It's said to think what happens through the next 8 or so years.

I can imagine this film was stunning in the theater when it was released. Cinemascope films have an unparalled color and depth. The movie was so crisp, clear and a burst of color that I first thought I was watching a blu-ray. No, just a normal DVD.

Robert Mitchum, a widower, meets Marilyn through his young son when they are picking up supplies in a town where Marilyn is a singer in a saloon.  Mitchum is doesn't approve of Marilyn and he quickly gathers his son up and heads for home.  Rory Calhoun plays Marilyn's boy friend.  He is a card cheat that sponges his stakes off of Marilyn. He wins a claim in a poker game that has to be filed in a town some distance away. Calhoun is sure his fortune is made. He and Marilyn head off to file the claim on the way they stop at the backwoods cabin where Mitchell and his son live. Calhoun wants to use Mitchum's raft to make the journey.  Mitchum tells him that the river is to dangerous there is white water rapids and a falls on the route.  Calhoun then wants supplies and horses to go overland. Mitchum refuses. Mitchum is diverted by smoke signals emitted from a nearby mountain. Calhoun clubs him from behind and commandeers the horses and supplies.  Marilyn refuses to leave the boy and Mitchum, so Calhoun takes off alone.  Meanwhile the war-painted Indians are headed down the mountain toward the cabin (the first of many clichs).  Mitchum recovers in time to direct the gathering a few supplies and weapons and the three head for the raft to barely escape the Indians.  Off they go down the ""River Of No Return"". Along the way they battle Indians, outlaws, rapids and the falls. They also develop a romantic relationship (surprise).

474090,5,630248443X,"Let's face it, Marilyn Monroe's bleached-blonde hair and 50's makeup is going to look out of place in an old-time western gold mining camp.  That is my only criticism of this exciting film.  But since she plays a saloon singer, her appearance is not so out of place at that.  As a saloon singer she does a creditable job with some delightful original songs.  Robert Mitchum is perfect for the role of a pioneering tough guy, and Tommy Rettig, the original Lassie TV series star, is wonderful as Mitchum's young son.  Add Rory Calhoun as the villain and you've got a winning cast.

The film is about a do-or-die whitewater raft trip down the River of No Return.  That designation is most famously given to the middle fork of the Salmon River in Idaho.  This movie, however, was filmed on the rivers of the majestic Canadian Rockies, resulting in a background of spectacular scenery.

He notices that there are Indians there looking thing over and probably don't like what they see. He finds his son who don't really recognize him,  in a good reunion scene. His son has been looked after by saloon girl Marilyn Monroe who asks him what kind of father he is to leave his son in a place like a gold camp. He takes his son to his farm which in on the banks of a river called the river of no return by the Indians because anyone who has gone down it hasn't returned. He and his son are getting to know each other when a they see a raft trying to go down the river and it's in trouble. Monroe and her Rory Calhoun who she is in love with are on it and he has to get to a town to file a gold claim he says he won in a poker game. Mitchum advises him to wait for a day or two until he can take them out. Calhoun won't wait and at the point of a gun takes Mitchum's only horse and rifle and pistol whips Mitchum. Monroe if furious and won't go with him but stays to help Mitchum. Despite what he has done though she still loves Calhoun and tries to make excuses for him. The Indians do go on the warpath and Mitchum,his son and Monroe must escape down the river on the raft.

There is allot of great scenery in this film which was shot in Canada and the blu ray is beautiful. Like many adult westerns from the 1950's this has complex mature characters and some interesting  plot developments such as why Mitchum was away so long. The performances are very good and you get to see Monroe in a different kind of role showing a strong maternal instinct. And this is a western so there is some good action. There is also a great opening theme song that Monroe later sings in the film. Really good, and a beautiful disc.",1348531200,2,1820,4.05

I like the characters, have always been a fan of Robert Mitchum's, and of Miss Monroe, too.  She shows such a softness and vulnerability in this movie, perhaps much like she was in real life?  Gorgeous Rory Calhoun plays a wonderful villain.  The lesson in this movie, learned by the little boy, is to not judge someone else unless you've experienced similar circumstances.  When the boy finds himself in the same sort of situation he had denounced his father for having done, he doesn't hesitate to protect his father with the weapon at hand.  Now he might come to understand how anyone can shoot someone else in the back and not have it be a cowardly act. Tho the movie is supposed to be re-mastered, the color wasn't great,,,but the scenery, the rapids, and background shots are still wonderful.

I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I was impressed by Monroe's acting and singing (although most of her singing was reportedly dubbed).  I was pleasantly surprised (almost shocked) by the lack of stereo-type ""Marilyn"" sexisms we usually see in her film.  It was sweet to see her interacting so much with the younger boy in the film, who also did an excellent job.  The song, ""River of No Return"" was beautiful and haunting--sung well by Tennesee Ernie Ford (not Robert Mitchum, as some claimed).  Marilyn did a great job as a sexy saloon girl who's tragically mixed up in a bad marriage.  I won't reveal the ending, but I will watch the entire film just to see it--it was done so well.  And I think she and Mitchum made a great pair.  I read that Joe Dimaggio, her boyfriend at the time, would often visit the set during the filming, because he feared her getting too involved with Mitchum (which reportedly didn't happen).  I wish she made more films like these.  On the whole, it is a great family film--and the breathtaking Canadian Rockies and the river rapids are one of the main scene-stealers.",1336348800,2,1262,4.609865470852018

474149,4,630248443X,"1954's RIVER OF NO RETURN is arguably one of Marilyn Monroe's most offbeat, unusual films.  A rollicking Western adventure, the film plays up her earthy side, with Monroe cast as a careworn saloon singer (with a heart of gold naturally) and her co-star Robert Mitchum, a close friend in real life, offers a solid grounding for her portrayal.

Matt Calder (Mitchum), a farmer with a murky past, rolls into a shanty town to reclaim his young son Mark (Tommy Rettig), who has found a loving surrogate home with saloon singer Kay Weston (Monroe).  Kay later comes back into Calder's life when her n'er-do-well boyfriend (Rory Calhoun) arrives on the Calder property, forcibly taking Matt's rifle and horse in order to stake his claim in another town; and leaving Matt, Kay and the boy in the path of warring Indians.  The group has no other option than to scramble aboard an old wooden raft and launch down the River of No Return...

RIVER OF NO RETURN takes a while to get going, plot-wise, but has lots of merits in it's favour; most notably the gorgeous location photography, captured in and around the Banff and Jasper national parks of Alberta, Canada.  This was one of the first 'big' CinemaScope releases.  Monroe (with the assistance of vocal double Gloria Wood) seductively strums her guitar around ""I'm Gonna File My Claim"", ""One Silver Dollar"", ""Down in the Meadow"" and the Title Song.  She's costumed by Travilla in some suitably tacky ""dance hall"" costumes but spends the best part of the story in bluejeans and a corset-blouse.

Meanwhile, the Indians go on the warpath, and the defenseless trio decides to seek refuge by fleeing the farm and sailing down the river on a raft.

Filmed in gorgeous Technicolor and CinemaScope with a larger budget, due to the star power involved in the project --- Much of it would be filmed in Banff and Jasper National Parks and Lake Louise in Alberta, turning out to be an exceptional western/adventure.

474192,4,630248443X,"I ordered this DVD having a bit of a Bob Mitchum season of movies - did this man have a great presence on screen or what?  I had no idea what to expect from this title.  Given Otto Preminger's reputation during his Film Noir years, I thought it might be quite entertaining.  Well, it was, but mostly for all the wrong reasons.  Marilyn Monroe breaking into incongruous ballads with her guitar every 30 mins, trying to pass herself off as a wayward circus performer, yet being made up to look like she's just walked off the set of the Beverly Hillbillies, was quite bizarre.  Something happened to American films and costuming about this time, everyone starts wearing denim with the legs rolled up (like Jimmy Stewart in The Man from Laramie) - suddenly everything gets tarted up with a Rockwell-esque brush.  The scenes of Mitchum and Monroe obviously on a film set with a grainy film backdrop of rapids behind them is so poorly executed it was also a scream (why they didn't just show us the stagehands rocking the raft from side to side, I'll never know).  I imagine Mitchum felt his time hadn't been wasted in the scene where he gets to rub Monroe down from head to toe with her wrapped in nothing but a blanket - a tough gig (that got my attention).  I have heard fairly uncomplementary things said about Rory Calhoun's acting ability, but in this I thought he was well cast and played it to perfection.  This movie is an interesting cultural document of what was appealing for the times, but it is one rather bizarre experience looking back at it now.  Everyone trying a little too hard to appeal to the contemporary fads while trying to tell a 'backwoods' story - doesn't quite gel, for some reason.  To complete the picture, the unexplained and inoffensive looking Indians make their appearance just for some drama, but they disappear as quickly as they turned up - of course being mute and burning everything in sight.  I was waiting for a ferocious grizzly bear to appear and charge Bob, but no.  I wasn't sorry I devoted a couple of hours watching this film - it is still entertaining if largely stretching the credibility gap.  Whichever way you look at it, Mitchum and Monroe were at the height of their fame and do their best in a rather lame, silly story.  Having said that, there are some interesting scenes as they make their way down the river, especially where they are waylaid by a trio of desperados - that was very well and believably executed.  Beware - this review is written by an Australian, so I don't mean to insult American sensibilities, however, this film, in my humble opinion, is largely a bit of Saturday matinee fluff that I suspect both stars took on for the pay cheque rather than the script.  Well worth a look, though, overall entertaining and certainly diverting.  Sometimes, however, it can be a little scary exploring the film archives of one's parent's generation.",1265587200,3,2906,4.642578125

The first one was embarassment @ the way Marilyn over-enunciated her words in it, but I understand that was @ the prompting of her acting coach.  I was much younger then & a huge Marilyn fan, nonetheless.  The song she sang to Tommy Rettig ""Down In The Meadow"" should be covered by Alison Krauss...it is so sweet & beautiful & I loved the tender way she related to him...it made me reflect on the tragedy of her never having her own children.  The scene where Robert Mitchum warms her up when she was sick was ""WHOA!""  Everybody can call it chemistry...it was hot.  & her performance of ""Who's Gonna File My Claim?"" made me want to perform the song the same way...she just knew the way it should be done.  Another favorite scene was when the Indians (as we so unapologetically called them in the olden un-PC days) attacked them on the raft.  Throughout the music hit just the right note of fatalistic mystery...after all, this was the River of No Return & even tho I know how it ends now, I still find the music exactly right.  There are other memorable scenes...in fact, nearly every scene is a revelation of some truth we should all believe.

474250,4,630248443X,"I very much enjoyed this movie.

It has something for everybody:beautiful scenery,great songs,the beauty of Marilyn,a bit of action,suspense.

The movie-going Public in the 50's did not enjoy Monroe in straight roles,and proved it by not buying many tickets to watch these films.

'Don't Bother to Knock','Niagara','The Misfits',and 'River of no Return' had very average Box-Office appeal.

However,i find this film pleasant to watch. The chemistry with Robert Mitchum works well. It is a nice touch to see Marilyn interact with a child (Rettig is doing a good job),but my favorite scenes are the ones at the Saloon. Monroe was doing her own singing,which was quite a rare occurance for actresses of that era.

Also something I found interesting,was the depiction of the Marilyn character,basically a 'Bad-girl' trying hard to be a 'Good-girl'.She plays it rather convincingly,in showing the dilemna of such an exercise.

To conclude,i believe that it is safe to say that this is not the best film of Preminger,but then again not his worst (calling..Skidoo ?)",1153526400,3,1059,5.236686390532545

The fact that the movie was shot in the picturesque Canada certainly helped. The roaring river and the rocky cliffs did not pale even when compared with River Wild (Meryl Streep) made decades later. Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe were a perfect couple. Two lonely souls in the west who deserved a better life.

For the superb cineamatography, the theme song (sang by Monroe during the movie and again at the end in a western cowboy style) and the leading characters, this is a movie to see.",1149292800,7,743,4.66412213740458

It should be noted that to Marilyns credit, she DID most of her own stunts, and she was also seriously injured during the shoot in the Canadian Rockies. Most actresses would never do their own stunts in a movie like this. Running the rapids on a flat wooden raft... but she did, and she looked like she knew what she was doing as well! Of course, we see her in 3 Travilla gowns that are breathtakingly all Marilyn.

I love this movie... it has scenery, music, Robert and Marilyn, a bad guy, and pre-Lassie Tommy Retig, who is great in his role as well. This is grand entertainment and a quality restoration.",1090713600,43,801,4.555555555555555
474283,3,630248443X,"Marilyn Monroe described this movie as a grade-Z cowboy movie where the acting finished third to the scenery and Cinemascope.  Okay, the Canadian Rockies and the rapids were utilized to its best for 1950's film-making, and MM's second film in Cinemascope must have made quite an impression in the theatres for the new aspect ratio.
It's 1875 in the wild Northwest.  Matt Calder is reunited with his young son Mark in a saloon town and rather than go the usual route of prospecting, start a new life on a farm bordering the River of No Return.  Their life is instantly disrupted by two events.  One, gambler Harry Weston, who's one a gold claim under dubious circumstances, is eager to file the claim in Council City to prevent the loser from beating him to it.  To that end, he steals Calder's horse and rifle, a capital offense in the codes of the West.  Second, a group of Native Americans on the warpath descend on the farm.  Both Calders and Kay, Weston's moll who stays behind to look after the injured Calder and his son, flee in time in the raft Weston and Kay arrived in.
From then on, it's a struggle to survive the rapids without any weapons, food, and constantly being drenched by that river whenever it's ""wild and free.""  As Calder tells Kay, ""The Indians call this the River of No Return.  From here on, you'll find out why.""  He is so dead set on getting his hands on Weston, he'll risk anything, all the time looking after his two charges.
Conflicts arrive in many forms, the primary two are Kay's torn loyalties between Harry and Matt.  She doesn't want Matt to kill Harry once the two meet up, and performs acts that range from desperate to being a seductive vamp, yet she realizes in their travails that he is thoughtful and unselfish, as demonstrated in the scene where he looks after her following her collapse from exhaustion.  The other involves the circumstances where Matt had to leave young Mark in the saloon town for five years, and while it's justified, there is a certain amount of stigma in it.
Marilyn gets to sing four songs here, the acoustic guitar tune ""One Silver Dollar"" and the piano bar tune ""I'm Gonna File My Claim"", ""Down In The Meadow"", and one of the best songs she's ever sung, the title ballad.  Her costumes aren't bad either, from the garish red dress she wears for the first song, the long green dress for the second tune, and the white blouse and anachronistic Levi's jeans she wears throughout the film.  And this is the longest her hair has been in films, albeit it being a blonde wig, of course.
Despite the costumes, it's not a Western in the traditional sense of the word, but River Of No Return pales to others in the genre it's purported to be because it's more drama than action.  Granted, this is not one of Marilyn's best films, nor is it that of Robert Mitchum's, Rory Calhoun's, or director Otto Preminger for that matter.  Monroe would have to wait until The Seven Year Itch for her next biggest hit.

I've never seen her quite like this in any of her other films.  I love all of her films, but this is a stand-out and unique.  I wouldn't rate it as one of her best films, but she IS super in it.  It's a Level 2 Marilyn film, not quite up there with How to Marry a Millionaire and The Seven Year Itch, but still pretty darn good!
Robert Mitchum is, as always, superb, and there is a good chemistry between the two.  A definite must on DVD for any Marilyn fan.  If only somewhat interested get the VHS, but Marilyn fans and Western fans will want the Widescreen DVD.",1062720000,19,739,4.161971830985915
474285,4,630248443X,"This film is superb as far as most Marylin films go. Mitchum does a great job in it as well, probably one of my favorite films featuring Robert Mitchum. Right next to Cape Fear. Monroe and Mitchum has a definitive chemistry on screen that I believe is none like in any other of her films. Mitchum provides that satiric rugged form that is essential to Mrs. Monroe's part in this film. Rory Calhoun needs not be left out. Calhoun is an integral mediary between to two stars who's character is just enough to keep you guessing. Mitchums and Calhouns relationship is far from mistakable in this film. It is by far one of my favorite Marylin films.",1045180800,5,644,4.512820512820513

474287,5,630248443X,"From 1952 - 1954 MM (Marilyn Monroe) acted in three serious dramatic movies; 1952 - ""Don't Bother to Knock - she played a crazy madwoman babysitter, 1953 - ""Niagara"" - a husband murdering adulterous (her greatest dramatic role ever) and 1954 - ""River Of No Return"" - a saloon singer who finds true love in the Pacific NorthWest (her Greatest dramatic love story)!!
In 1954 MM was voted Photoplay magazines favorite female actress (Todays equivalent is ""Peoples Magazines).  MM was reaching her prime and everyone loved Marilyn.  Unfortunately many critics and fans would not accept Marilyn's dramatic talents and only loved her in comedies.

474288,3,630248443X,"Though I am a huge Marilyn fan, even I must admit that this movie is a stinkeroo. It's not quite bad enough to be campy,but it is, as Marilyn herself described one of her worst roles, "" a Z cowboy movie."" If you know your M.M. history you may find this film interesting because of the trivia surrounding its making. Co-star Robert Mitchum, who loved and respected M.M., was an old friend who first met her as a 16 year old, when he worked along side the then Norma Jeans first husband in a factory. Also during the filming, she was joined by former room mate and good friend, Shelley Winters, who was in Canada filming an equally forgettable film, ""Saskatchewan"", with Alan Ladd. Shelley, Marilyn, and Bob Mitchum would get together at night for cocktails and to complain and laugh about their respective roles. The director of this film, Otto Preminger, notoriously felt this film and Marilyn were beneath him, and grew to despise M.M., and what he considered her un-professionalism. He was even less tolerent of M.M's then acting coach, Natasha Lytess, who, with Marilyns growing stature at the box office, wielded much influence, sometimes demanding re-takes , which questioned Premingers authority. She was eventually thrown off the film by Preminger, after critiquing and confusing child co-star, Tommy Rettig. Marilyn also suffered a leg injury during the films shoot, the severity of which was questionable, but apparently she did have a cast, of sorts, and in several scenes where her lower extremeties are covered with a blanket, it was as much to hide the cast as to suggest protecting her from the cold. Aside from all this useless trivia that only freaks like me know and care about, the only other thing of interest in this film is the obvious one, the presence of M.M. In spite of her lack of faith in the script, and her growing displeasure with the shooting, she is incredibly beautiful in this film. Though I saw this movie late in my admiration for M.M., it contains some of my fave M.M. moments. Her singing is surprisingly good and bluesy, she makes a couple of undistinguished tunes sound actually good, and the snippet where she sings the sweet ""lullabye"" to the little boy whilst playing the guitar, well...her beauty, simplicity, and purity provide a very tender Marilyn ""moment."" Also, near the end, where she's singing the title song amongst a group of extras, who seem genuinely enamored and admiring of her, she is other-worldly beautiful, projecting a luminosity and sincerety that overrides the flaws of the film. Marilyn's acting was admittedly not her best here. This is partly because, as she was then under the tutelage of coach Lytess, she enunciated each word, as directed by Lytess, to the point that it's unintentionally comical and wooden in delivery. Watching her just a few years later in ""Bus Stop"", she's just as beautiful, but had grown so as an actress, that it almost seems like a totally different person. All these negatives aside, if you're a movie fan who can appreciate the sometimes intangible and unspoken magic of the medium, then M.M.'s luminous, legendary presence may be enough for you to get through this film, which would have been a total bore, had it starred anyone other than the Golden Girl herself.",1022716800,8,3262,4.847670250896058

The plot is rather silly... (there hardly is one)... but the scenery is intense.  Marilyn, a man, and a boy travel down a dangerous river on a raft - the man in search of Marilyn's boyfriend who stole his horse and rifle, and Marilyn in search of her true love (or so she thought).
There are a few musical numbers, and some cute costumes.... the beautiful Marilyn and the Canadian landscapes make this movie lovely eye candy... but the plot and dialogue is so lame... don't expect much more!",1019260800,2,687,4.444444444444445

Robert Mitchum is one of the Best Actors of all time and Tommy Rettig in one of his earlyest  roles showed that he was destine for greater things. Rory Calhoun as the Despicable Weston had some better roles but in this showed he was capable of playing the Heavy. All in all a very good film and worth watching again and again, especially if one is a Marilyn Monroe Fan, Just 27 when Filmed she was showing her Star power in this movie.",1511654400,,557,4.254716981132075
