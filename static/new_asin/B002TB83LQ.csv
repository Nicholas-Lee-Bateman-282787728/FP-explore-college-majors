8380034,5,B002TB83LQ,Don't listen to Jennifer's horrible review! This movie is amazing and one of my favorites ever! It is about practically every single issue in the world today and addresses so many relevant and important issues in life.,1404345600,,218,4.918918918918919
8380035,1,B002TB83LQ,"I cannot begin to tell  you how much I hated this movie.  My heart hurts to say that about something that is supposed to convey Christian views. The acting, storyline, sound etc were just substandard. Save your money.  Get something else.",1361059200,,238,4.7560975609756095
8380036,4,B002TB83LQ,"For a short,  low budget Christian film,  this was pretty good.  Especially the acting. (except for the guy who played the detective.  He's the reason I took off a star.) It kind of reminded me of the breakfast club,  except I actually liked this movie.  This is definately something worth watching.",1323302400,2,299,4.764705882352941
8380037,4,B002TB83LQ,"This was a half way decent ""Low Budget"" movie, but it made it's point! At least some good Christian viewing, though a little secular, but then again, Believers can't alienate themselves from non-believers, and expect to be able to win them to the Lord! I think this was an alright movie..Can't beat the price I paid for it! God Bless..Ed Dennis (MrEd)",1272844800,3,351,4.67741935483871
