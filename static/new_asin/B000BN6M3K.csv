8089284,5,B000BN6M3K,The Libreros are wonderful instructors and dancers. I have danced for over 20 years and got sloppy with my dancing. I tried several other instructional videos but none can hold a candle to the dance DVDs from the Libreros. Since I purchased this I have 7 more. They are all fantastic. Both Blanch and Emilio teach. Thus both the woman and man see what their part is and then see how the couple move together to make a story on the dance floor. Having their DVS is like having your own Dance Coach in your living room.,1475971200,,517,4.34020618556701
