560896,5,6303112064,"After working at the Old Faithful Inn, this movie is the perfect fix for when I'm feeling ""homesick""  so neat to see the hotel in her early years, with bark still on the pillars near the front desk.",1454025600,5,198,4.2105263157894735
560897,5,6303112064,"This fantastic little 1936 programmer from Universal looks and feels more like one of those topflight RKO productions of the period minus all the big stars. Beautiful outdoor locations and a good story directed with charm and style by Arthur Lubin make for a nifty little ""B"" with no wasted moments.

The story begins in Yellowstone Park when Ruth Foster (Judith Barrett) arrives to meet the father she hasn't seen for 18 years. She also meets Ranger Dick Sherwood (Henry Hunter) and a very nice mood is set by director Rubin as a romance quickly develops between the couple.

Her dad is being followed, however, and his past in San Quentin and search for a buried treasure others are after will nearly drive the young lovers apart. When his body is washed up by a steaming geyser in the park, the discovery that he was murdered will form a cloud over the couple not easily removed.

Andy Devine offers comic relief as Dick's pal who aspires to be a Ranger. There is a nice outdoor atmosphere and some warm and charming scenes between Dick and Ruth enjoying tales by the campfire and songs of the west sung by firelight. When it becomes apparent that Ruth's father was murdered with Sherwood's gun, only finding the hidden money in a cave near the geyser and confronting the true culprit can bring the couple together again.

This is a warm and romantic ""B"" film with a good little mystery and some nice performances from the two leads. Don't miss Andy Devine trying to get the Chinese cook to make him a chicken sandwich! This is definitely a good one for fans of ""B"" films.",1220572800,8,1575,4.594306049822064
560898,4,6303112064,"Ruth Foster (Judith Barrett) comes to Yellowstone National Park to meet her father (Ralph Morgan), a man she has not seen for most of her life. He has just gotten out of jail after serving time for a major robbery. Legend says that the money was stashed in Yellowstone somewhere, and it seems that a few fortune seekers believe the legend to be true and expect that Mr. Foster will lead them to it. Their greed is great, and when Mr. Foster's body comes spewing from a geyser, Ruth's boyfriend Ranger Sherwood (Henry Hunter) vows to solve the crime. Also appearing is Andy Devine in a role largely present for comic relief.

A beautiful film thanks for a tremendous location, Yellowstone is a memorable murder mystery. It follows the same routine that most of these movies do, only there are some unexpected twists and turns which make it quite unique. The methods to the mayhem stand out, and in just over an hour, viewers are flooded with action throughout.",1212883200,,959,4.674556213017752

7837681,4,6303112064,"A delightful example of an early film, set on location.  Made me wish this film would someday be ""colorized"" to bring out the extraordinary beauty of the park!  Wonderful old cars, clothes, and cabins make this a treat.",1473724800,3,219,4.7368421052631575

7837684,5,6303112064,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this old movie. I am a regular visitor to Yellowstone Park. I particularly liked seeing the old scenes from Yellowstone Park, such as the old Northern Pacific train pulling up to the Park's north entrance outside of Gardiner Montana. The train no longer runs to the park and the railroad tracks and the train depot are no longer there. There are many old scenes of Yellowstone Park and it's geysers. Some of the geyser scenes are staged and are not geographically accurate (such as the ammonia gas fumes), but the movie is still fun to watch, It's kind of neat to compare the old scenes to today's Yellowstone Park. Yellowstone Park has changed in many ways (mostly for the good) since this old movie was produced. Although the movie's outcome is fairly predictable, it's a nice change of pace from today's movies. I imagine I will watch it again after my next trip to Yellowstone.",1468454400,2,911,4.735849056603773
7837685,4,6303112064,"Black and White, Simple characters, simple detective story plot and dialog; and yet it is a quite pleasant way to spend an hour.  Do people still sing around a campfire?  I hope so.",1468022400,3,181,4.454545454545454
7837686,5,6303112064,"Classic if flawed melodrama with stock characters. LImited views of the park, funny scene where they are all anticipating a geyser eruption standing a few feet away from the crater. Then the geyser erupts (stock footage) with such force they all would have been killed.

Black and White despite the publicity cover.",1464566400,4,315,5.0576923076923075
