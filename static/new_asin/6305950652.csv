7898289,2,6305950652,"I'm surprised at the rave reviews people have given the Spot Christmas video! We have them all - and this is the only one that my now 4-year-old son just walks away from! It's boring boring boring, in our opinion.",1131321600,,213,4.35
7898290,5,6305950652,"As a Spot sound book collector and one that's on the quest to watch all the Spot episodes and specials, I'd say this is by far the best Spot video of the bunch I've seen so far. And I've almost seen them all, including the only-released-in-Britain ""It's Fun to Learn with Spot"" series. The only one episode I haven't seen, at least not completely, is the ""Spot and His Grandparents Go To the Carnival"" special, which I caught only a split-second of on TV in Singapore little more than 5 years ago and got me started on this journey.

In any case, in this special, Spot meets with some reindeers who work for Santa and somehow lost the sleigh while testing it. The reindeers do the tango, Spot goes gather up his friends and go find the sleigh. Then Spot is whisked off to the North Pole, visits Santa's workshop, and then back home again.

The dialog is the most witty I've seen in the Spot series so far, and the lips of the characters actually move to reflect the speech - something that was not done before (due to the fact that in the original British airings of the series, the entire story is basically just narrated and voiced by one person. The Disney dubs of the series basically tried to add more voice variety by adding more casts, and were met with mixed results). I personally have no qualms with either format, but some people I know was put off by the fact that the lips of the characters does not move to the speech in the series, and would probably be pleased by the change in this special (the change is only temporary, tho. When Spot's Musical Adventures a.k.a Discover Spot was released, they reverted back to the old format).

All in all, it's a nice series. My copy of ""Spot and His Grandparents go to the Carnival"" should be in my mail anytime soon, so we can see how this one holds out to it then. Until then, I consider this one of best, if not the best, of the bunch.

7898291,5,6305950652,Based on  the Spot stories by Eric Hill. Spot's Magical Christmas (1995) was an enchanted story  with magnificent music and Classic Walter Disney (1901-1966) animation. Good illusrations.,1083369600,,187,5.888888888888889
7898292,5,6305950652,This is the best video in the Spot series!  My three year old loves it and so does Mom and Dad!  The animation and story are delightful.  I look forward to bringing it out again at Christmas time.  Yeah Spot!,1042416000,,208,4.125
7898293,1,6305950652,"This spot video is comleetly different than the others, the animation is more ""Disneyfied"" and looks like any other kids cartoon all the magic of the original Spot videos is gone -- gone are the simple ""cut out"" backgrounds replaced by cartoon junk. What's worse, the sound is noisey, no more quiet well balanced background tune, the one song (sung by reindeers) is appalingly bad.  In short it may be better suited to older (2-4) aged kids but my 18 mo old just sat there and did not react at all (I think she was annoyed too) whereas on the other videos she goes crazy with joy (whenever Tom and Helen appear).",1034294400,,612,4.464285714285714
7898294,5,6305950652,"OH, I hate this video. Hate it with a passion. I'd like to take every copy in existence and pound them to dust. If there's one thing I hate more it's the book by Eric Hill of the same title (with the same story.) Only problem is my daughter would never speak to me again.
My daughter was given this video over five years ago. Every December it gets dragged off the shelf and played - and played, and played, and played. Then most nights she wants me to read her the book.
This simple tale of Spot helping two reindeer to find Santa's lost sleigh (lost during the annual pre-Christmas test drive) and his voyage to Santa's workshop has it all for the little ones - dramatic tension, colour, excitement, in jokes (I still laugh over my daughter surrounded by an acre of torn wrapping paper on Xmas morning saying ""Daddy, the presents got all excited"") and to top it all off a little bit of the jolly old man in red.
Of all the Spot videos this is the one that has stayed her favourite, indeed at eight last December she watched it and enjoyed it still.
A wonderful, magic tale for small children. Believe me, buy it for your pre-schooler and you will end up knowing every word.",1003536000,,1175,4.321266968325792
