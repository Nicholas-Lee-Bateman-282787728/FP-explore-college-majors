3951465,4,B002M3JJE6,"I have an important question regarding this product that is missing.
Does this DVD contain ""closed captioning"" or ""subtitles"" ?
As a person who regularly uses both of these features, I have sadly noticed that most, if not all A & E
produced material I have purchased does not include either.
Until I can confirm that, I will refrain from purchasing this DVD set.
It's a wondeful show that I truly enjoy, I just wish the company that makes it would advise the consumer whether or not it contains the captioning, or subtitling that many of us need.",1262217600,2,546,4.581632653061225

3951472,5,B002M3JJE6,"I am pretty much hooked on Pawn Stars and am enjoying Season 1 very much. My son is also a big fan now, too. I have learned a lot about a whole lot of obscure items by watching this series. The guys are fun and I believe they have a really good time at work. My niece gets to visit Las Vegas occasionally and she is searching diligently for a unique item to attempt to sell to Rick so she will get to be on the show. I don't know how that works but she would be a good one. My son fusses a little because he thinks they pick on Chum too much but that's just part of the fun. The Old Man is terrific and is perfect for the show. I am glad to have this set and think it is great to watch more than once.  I am looking forward to Series 2.",1428364800,,736,3.717948717948718

Some of the sellers are morons ... they tell us they picked up the item at a garage sale for $1.00 and then want $25,000 for it when the real value is learned.  Greedy people.  And then they are insulted when offered $1500.00 for it.

3951579,5,B002M3JJE6,I love this show.  I like to trying to guess how much they would offer to the client.  I like to see the clients reaction to the offer.,1400544000,,135,3.7857142857142856

3951581,5,B002M3JJE6,My husband and I don't have cable or dish TV. So when we come across a program that we both like we can watch it for hours. This program is so interesting with the most colorful cast of characters! They make us laugh out loud. This is also a very educational show which makes it even better.,1399593600,,291,4.12280701754386
3951582,4,B002M3JJE6,"Not much to say, it is what it is.  This show is a great way to learn about the pawn industry and how you can get a lot more for your items if you list them on Craig's list or similar sites online.",1399075200,,197,3.5813953488372094

3951584,5,B002M3JJE6,"Saw this on a friend's TV, I don't have cable, and was thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime.  The show provides background and details explaining how pawn shops work and what has value.  Some of the extra history of items is also provided and I am now hooked!",1398556800,,258,4.244897959183674

3951588,5,B002M3JJE6,Interesting learning series exposing the operation of a pawn shop and how unprepared people can really get taken for a ride if they don't know the value of the product they want to pawn or sell.  Apparently the pawn shops are strictly a cash business which makes me wonder how good their relationship with the IRS is.,1397433600,,317,4.56140350877193
3951589,5,B002M3JJE6,We love watching this without commercials. We love watching the stuff that comes in their shop and even some of the junk that comes in there.,1397260800,,141,4.461538461538462

3951591,5,B002M3JJE6,Love the show it's both entertaining and educational. The program appeals to a wide audience I enjoy watching the episodes back to back without commercials.,1396828800,,156,5.28
3951592,5,B002M3JJE6,"Not sure what the attraction is, but I love this show.  And: On these old episodes the old man was lovable, not the grump he acts on the show today.  Is he really grumpy, or does some producer make up the dialog,  Hummmmm.",1396828800,,222,4.116279069767442
3951593,5,B002M3JJE6,Lots of interesting things to see and learn as you gain insight to an interesting world of pawn shop owners!,1396742400,,108,4.45
3951594,5,B002M3JJE6,"It's amazing that the first thing we noticed was how much weight Big Hoss and Chumlee have lost and our hats off to those two guys.  Wow, season one is almost like seeing it again for the first time.  We remember some of the stuff but not enough of it to ruin the entertainment value of the show.",1396396800,,296,4.086206896551724
3951595,2,B002M3JJE6,"I hate shows that are full of crude language.  Beeping it out doesn't help either.  The subject might be interesting, but I won't wade through that language.",1395964800,,157,4.777777777777778
3951596,5,B002M3JJE6,"Good to see them a few years younger.  Kind of like Antiques Roadshow with a lot more comedy and interpersonal play between characters.  Got introduced to this program during a hospital stay.  Mildly educational, majorly entertaining. Good for occasional viewing - watch one after the other and it gets old pretty quickly.",1395964800,,322,5.153846153846154
3951597,2,B002M3JJE6,"The novelty for this show wore off pretty quick for me.  When I first watched it, it was o.k.  As I started to read up on Gold & Silver Pawn (I've emailed the constantly about and autograph I have but have gotten no replies AT ALL), and the show itself I realized how fake this show is.  Rick, The Old Man, Big Hoss, Chum Lee and the rest of the cast are all actors paid big money to make themselves look like they've got all the knowledge about things coming through the front door of their shop and to play stupid pranks and jokes on each other to raise ratings for the History Channel.  I also found out that the cast is never seen in the shop when fans make a visit to the shop.  It's just my opinion but I wouldn't waste your hard-earned cash on these guys.  The money just makes them and the creators of the show richer.",1395878400,,826,4.099378881987578
3951598,5,B002M3JJE6,This is a great show if you like a combination of history and crazy dorky funny guys.  I love this show.,1395705600,,104,3.9523809523809526

3951600,5,B002M3JJE6,Love the show!  I like that they have some history on the items.  Chumley is my favorite.  The half-hour goes by to fast!,1395446400,,121,4.173913043478261
3951601,3,B002M3JJE6,I like the history behind the items that come in to the shop but.... too many beeps. need to clean up their language.,1395446400,,117,4.130434782608695
3951602,5,B002M3JJE6,"I love the show Pawn Stars.  I am glad to get it in HD on my 8.9"" HDX.  The picture is beautiful.  My only complaint is that every once in a while I will see a part of the show in black and white.  Not sure why they would do that - but its only one segment of the show maybe 30 seconds.",1395273600,,286,3.492063492063492

3951606,5,B002M3JJE6,I enjoy the history and the business parts of the show. However I could do less with the drama that goes along with it.,1394236800,,119,4.0
3951607,3,B002M3JJE6,This might be a very good show and one could learn a lot from it BUT it has too much profanity for me to truly enjoy it.,1393632000,,120,3.4814814814814814
3951608,4,B002M3JJE6,"This is great background TV. I loved having it on and it captured my attention more than once while playing,",1393545600,,108,4.45
3951609,5,B002M3JJE6,It's great knowlege there are no words to describe how good it is .and it doesn't need my input it's already good,1393372800,,113,4.181818181818182

3951611,5,B002M3JJE6,"I had never seen these early episodes, but I love the series. Here in the opening episodes you learn what some of the basics of the pawnbroking business are as well as some of the rationale that Rick uses in making his offers and negotiating for his price. A little slow on the banter and the interoffice hijinks and rather harsh on Chumly.",1391817600,,340,4.412698412698413
3951612,5,B002M3JJE6,"I really like this show and feel like it teaches history effectively in a fun and relevant way.  Yes, they stage some (if not most) of the scenes, but really who cares.  I also like the old man, so sit down and watch it dumb-dumb.",1391385600,,230,4.088888888888889

3951614,4,B002M3JJE6,One of my go-to choices for watching while I cook dinner or fold laundry. Usually has some interesting historical info thrown in. Better than Storage Wars.,1390435200,,155,5.0
3951615,5,B002M3JJE6,"I watch this show all the time. It is very entertaining. As I understand it, this is no reality show, just a TV series of scripted shows. I don't care - it's still funny.",1390348800,,170,4.029411764705882

3951617,5,B002M3JJE6,"In the shop where everyting has a price the wheeling and dealing of the pawn broker family is at both serious(money and value wise) and lots of fun as the pawnbroker family out smart and play tricks on each other. The authenticism of the products brought in for pawn often leads up some strange roads and very often that which seems so worthy, becomes just a copy or counterfeit under  the examination of the many experts the brokers have at their beck and call.

As they say at the start of every show. Everything in the store has a price.",1390176000,,540,4.39

3951632,4,B002M3JJE6,If I start watching its hard to stop. I especially like when experts come in to value or authenticate an item. The interaction between the fathers and sons and Chumly is usually hilarious and the occasional mistakes in buying fake items by all of them makes the show believable.,1388966400,,278,4.6938775510204085

I LOVE HISTORY and almost ALL the buys have history attached to it.  The interaction between the men (Grandfather, son and grandson) is just fun...after watching seasons 1-4 non-stop, they really do care for each other.  Again...the history lesson attached to the items people bring in to sell is wonderful.  New been a gun buff...but now I LOVE the ""Blunderbust"" gun...and the history behind it.  I now know what markings to look for on antique silver pieces.  I have my favorite ""experts"" that get called in.  Anyway, if anyone just want to be purely entertained...this is your show.",1375574400,,756,4.7251908396946565

3951669,4,B002M3JJE6,I can't stop watching this because i just can't believe what people actually bring in to pawn.  Some of the people have great antiques that have been handed down from generation to generation to be left with someone who is just going to buy something they really don't need.  after watching this I now want to go to a pawn shop and just see what they have.  My biggest fear is getting ripped off buying something I think is valuable only later to find that it was just a reproduction.,1374710400,,484,4.355555555555555

3951675,5,B002M3JJE6,My family and I watch this program every summer when we go away to Canada (we do not have cable at home). We enjoy the variety of eclectic and often downright bizarre objects that various people bring to the proprietors of the pawn shop. It's fun to guess as to the values of the various merchandise and try to predict whether or not the sellers will take the offered deals.,1373760000,,374,4.357142857142857

3951680,3,B002M3JJE6,"This show succeeds despite itself. The three main characters are badly spoken and shallow, but they aren't the reason to watch. The appeal is the insane variety of things that people sell. In a manner of speaking, this is Antiques Roadshow meets Let's Make A Deal.",1372118400,,264,4.760869565217392

3951683,5,B002M3JJE6,"With the glut of 'reality' shows out there (including all the trash that gets foisted on us by E!, TLC, and MTV), it's refreshing to find networks like the History Channel providing more genuine, legitimately entertaining, reality fare like ""Pawn Stars"".  ""Pawn Stars"" chronicles three generations of the Harrison family (and family friend Chumlee) as they operating their Las Vegas pawn shop, Gold & Silver Pawn.  The basic premise is the stories and dealings behind fascinating items that people come into the shop to sell.  The items can be intriguing based on their inherent value, like championship sports rings; their history value, such as a 1960's Les Paul guitar; or eclectic curiosity like taxidermy animals.  The story being told about the items is just as important, if not more important, than what it actually sells for.

  Now, while this could make for a solid show on those merits alone, what really sets ""Pawn Stars"" apart is the personality of its stars.  Rick Harrison opened the pawn shop in the late 80's with his father (referred to as ""The Old Man"") and brought his son Corey (and his friend, Chumlee) in to the business when they were old enough.  The Old Man is a funny curmudgeon; Rick is the often annoyed director of this circus; Corey is the frustrated son trying to prove himself; and Chumlee is the 'village idiot', who is dumb like a fox in how he has managed to parlay his popularity into a major side business.  They have some of the edginess of the Teutul family from ""American Chopper"" without any of the overt hostility and meanness of the Teutuls.

  Another success component of the show is its arsenal of subject experts who help evaluate the authenticity and value of the items the Harrisons are trying to purchase.  Some of the more notable ones include Mark Hall-Patton, the administrator of the Clark County Heritage Museum, who helps authenticate historical items; the adorable Rebecca Romney, of Bauman Rare Books, who is called in whenever their is an intriguing piece of literature in the shop; and Johnny Jiminez, who assesses vintage toys.  Two of the experts, Rick Dale of Rick's Restoration and Danny Coker of Counts Kustoms, have turned their participation into successful spin-off reality series of their own.

  There have been criticisms about the staged nature of the some of the deals, but that is just nit-picking and totally beside the point.  It's the interaction of the people and the stories they have that is the point.  This is must watch for me.",1371600000,,2512,4.865882352941177
3951684,5,B002M3JJE6,I love that this was a complete Season.  My mother who is 85 loves the show and does not have internet or cable so we can only watch what is on the DVD set.

3951721,3,B002M3JJE6,"Was just watching Season 1 Episode with the awesome Amazon Prime Instant and realized, sadly, that my favorite show is an arranged fake.

Season 1 Episode 8. A guy (Ron who is Rick Dale's Brother from American Restoration) brings in an early Coke machine to sell to Pawn Stars. Ron (who is an expert on vintage Coke machines) claims he is selling the Coke machine that has been in his family for years and that he knows nothing about it.  Really? Come on Ron, you buy and pick Vintage coke machine for a living and help your brother Rick Dale of American Restorations restore them.

To top that major fakery off, Rick Harrison ends up taking the Coke Machine to Rick Dale of American Restoration to restore (the place where the guy that sold the Coke machine works). The machine Ron brought into Rick's Pawn Shop was a Vendo 39, but the restored machine that Rick picked up was a  Cavalier 79. The dimensions of the two machines are not even the same.

However, one noticeable void in my life that I soon realized was that I no longer had junk tv to put on in the background (when I'm doing something much more important, such as writing Amazon product reviews). So, it was quite relieving when I realized that Pawn Stars was available on Amazon Prime. I think the show is entertaining and grabs my attention more often than I think it will (especially the scenes with Chumly).

3951750,4,B002M3JJE6,"Pawn Stars is one of those shows that I happened to run across one day when there was nothing else on television.
Now, I have them all marked to tape on my DVR so that I don't miss a new episode or a rerun that I've not seen yet.
The cast is awesome and some of these items that come in there are really really cool.

I only gave it 4 stars because it's the first season. As the seasons go on you really get a good idea of how they do business, the family becomes closer as well as a bigger pain in Rick's butt, you know, like real family.

Rick is defiantly the star of the show, and the Old Man has years of experience and he's cranky to boot. Kind of like a surly Yoda.
Big Hoss (Cory) in this season kind of feels like the new kid on the block trying his best to keep up with the veterans of his dad and grandpa, but it's got to be Chumlee who steals the show. That boy is 10 different kinds of stupid. And just when you think he doesn't know the head from a hole in the ground, he'll bust out some arcane piece of information that will have the entire store stumped on how he knew that.

This show is great fun, some stuff the customers bring in is real, some is fake, but as the opening of the show states ""you never know what's gonna come in through those doors"".",1364256000,,1270,3.953125

Supposedly these guys don't even buy stuff over the counter anymore.  Supposedly History gives people stuff to ""sell"" with a script of what to say and how much to take.  If you like watching that, knock yourself out.  I used to watch the show every week.  That makes it pointless.  Plus Rich's laugh is just creepy.

If people were really stupid enough to consistently take less than half of what they say is the minimum they will accept, I'd feel even worse about the show.  But the best part about it is that it is fake.

Also, one of the best things about the show is the family dynamic of the characters. They make the show worth watching and they are hilarious at times. I bought Season 1 and 2 of the show after seeing it on TV and after watching Season 1 it didn't dissapoint. I only wish there were more episodes on Season 1. It only has 16 episodes, I'm guessing because that was their debut season, but Season 2 has double that. All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase.

He is a hot-head. He prides himself on correcting his customer's mistakes, and not in a polite way. When buying an item, they will ask you what you want for the item, then offer half that. And sometimes even lower. When you ask for more, they will claim that it will take years to sell and that they are not a ""collecter"" of the item. But they never mention that they have a contact book full of collecters that will pay for the item for what it is worth or more. They will not accept an item for 90% or 80% of it's worth, it has to be 75% or less. Then they turn around and sell the item for 15-25% more than it's value.

In other words, they are taking advantage of people who desperatly need the money. Most of these folks needed the money to pay rent or they are on the streets, homeless. And they claim that hollywood gave pawn shops a bad name?",1359763200,4,1013,4.1421319796954315

I don't see the excitment of watching these jerks rip people off and steal their stuff over and over again.

This is the most ""real"" family on TV showing the horseplay and general tomfoolery that are an integral part of having a family business. The crew of four includes ""The Old Man"" who started the business and acts as the voice of experience and keeps his son and grandson in check, ""Big Hoss"", the grandson son who is learning the business, and ""Chumlee"", the lifelong friend of Big Hoss who provides some very funny comic relief.

They work together as a team with some frat boy antics that all guys will relate to, but always keep the business in the forefront. This is the background of the Los Vegas Pawn Shop, which is the setting for all manner of strange objects that are brought into the shop, usually to be sold. Each item is examined by the team for value and authenticity, and we learn some arcane history in the process. When there are questions of authenticity, one of the shop's outside experts will come in and examine the piece and provide some interesting information and make a decision as to whether it is what is seems to be.

This is Antiques Roadshow without the mannered antiques experts, and serious tone.

I am not into most reality shows but these history show ones are pretty good.  I watched 2 seasons of storage wars and though it was good.  Then because they had three seasons of pawn stars on netflix streaming, I decided to give it a shot.

This show is awesome.  It is like an antique roadshow for people who like cool stuff rather than dolls and furniture.

Anyway The family that owns the pawn shop is really cool as well as chunlee the employee.

Looking forward to watching season 4 and 5.

Really addicting.  Watched 2 seasons in 2 weeks.

Now I want to get a 1962 Lincoln and restore it.

So many cool things come up on the show and I learn so much.

The show, as it currently airs on TV, is about a world famous pawn shop that does half of its business with tourists. In the newer shows, they'll buy anything as they've built up a reputation for having offbeat and different items. In these episodes from the start of the series, it was a little different. Some things they wouldn't buy as they had no market for it and some items they would only make halfhearted offers on. Also, at the start of the series, they'd have to travel to see the experts whereas now the experts come into the pawn shop to appraise items. It was more like a typical pawn shop in the beginning and it is interesting to see the difference.

3951841,4,B002M3JJE6,"Recently I got addicted to watching the show. However, the show is basically the same for every show. The only difference is the items people bring in. The dialogue is pretty much the same when the items are presented, even the bargaining dialogue is pretty much the say. The old man is pretty funny, Corey is decent, and Rick is very repetitive. My only problem with the show is how they treat Chumlee. He is a simple guy who is pretty funny and nice but the three main guys treat him like crap. He is a big part of the show and they do even bother putting him in the opening credits. I feel bad for the guy.

Overall, the show is enjoyable but very repetitive. It's one of the best shows on television right now. I just wish they'd treat Chumlee with a little more respect since he basically the whole show.",1308787200,2,809,4.287581699346405

3951845,5,B002M3JJE6,"I'm not a big fan of reality TV, in fact, this is the only reality television that I watch, and I love it. Recently, the whole fam was seated in the living room watching this show and my daughter said, ""You know who Rick looks like?"" And I paused and couldn't come up with anything. Finally she said, ""He's Homer Simpson come to life. Look at him - he looks just like Homer!""

I love Rick even more now. :)

The show is such an interesting sociological study for so many different reasons. There's an awesome and interesting family dynamic between hardworking Rick and ""The Old Man"" and the always-had-everything-handed-to-him third generation son ""Corey."" I've read that many successful family businesses die off at the third generation. Seems the first generation (Hard-working Dad) and the second generation (Hard-working son Rick) remember those lean years and tough times and appreciate the value of a dollar and the joy and satisfaction of success. And then when the third generation comes along, all they've ever known is abundance and having everything they ever wanted dropped in their avoirdupois lap.

Enter stage left Corey.

It's fun to watch the show, but I cringe when he comes on screen. It pains me to hear how he talks to ""The Old Man."" Maybe he's a swell, upstanding, hardworking kid and the bratty kid spiel is part of the ""show."" I hope so. Gosh, I hope so.

Aside from that, it's a fascinating insight into the hidden treasures stashed inside American attics and garages. It also proves that you should be careful about tossing out ""old junk."" Several times, visitors to the shop explain that they found their treasure in a trash pile somewhere.

Excellent show, and presents a piece of American history in a most intriguing way! And personally, the first season is the best. There's a naturalness in that first season that I especially love.",1283731200,10,1864,4.809375

Pawn Shop is funny to watch because the family who run the shop are so amusing. Best though is (for us as parents) one learns a lot while watching. All kinds of things come into the pawn shop everyday. These guys know a lot about history and so we, the viewers, learn about antique coins, WW1 uniforms, ancient weapons....just to name a fraction of all the stuff that comes into the pawn shop. If no one knows about an item a prospective seller brings in, the pawn shop guys will call in experts and we all learn something together in a really fun way.

3951847,5,B002M3JJE6,"I got hooked on this show as soon as I first saw it on the History Channel. Unfortunately I missed many of the earlier episodes, mostly because of the late starting time. This is the best way to catch up and avoid the commercials at the same time. This show is so much better than the antiques roadshow. With this you get to see items being appraised and purchased that the average person might have tucked away in a closet as opposed to old chairs, furniture and fine art on Roadshow. The pace of the show is fast and the dialog is entertaining, thanks to the very good chemistry of Rick the owner, the old man, rick's son and his friend Chumley. They are a likable group. I prefer watching these guys any day over those two obnoxious characters on the other History Channel show, American Pickers. If you're really interested in the collectibles market this is well worth purchasing.",1279238400,3,885,4.5375

The ""Old Man"" is just outroariously funny as one Crusty Old Dude, his son is a font of information and Hoss is a barrel of frustration dealing with those two handfuls. I won't even go on about Chumlee as comic relief. As they would say The History Channel hit one out of the ball park with this one! I just hope that this series continues for a good long time!

3951866,5,B002M3JJE6,"This is the only show I watch regularly because I learn about collectible items, about the pawn business, and negotiating.  It is set in Las Vegas and is truly watchable and unique.  The show is corny and unintentionally funny but the episodes are well constructed and edited which keeps your interest and the characters are genuine.

Rick Harrison is the main character of the show.  He is a competent and likable guy who laughs at his own jokes.  He has the most screen time each show.  Often people have items that he does not know the value of, and they have to call an expert in to appraise it. Rick has a bunch of experts who probably wish they never met him because he constantly calls them, but that is what makes the show interesting.  The funniest thing is that the expert then appraises the item right in front of the seller.  Rick's negotiation style is to listen to what the customer wants and then counter with 40% of whatever they want.  So if they want $100 he offers $40 and then talks about how the item is deficient, how he has to make a profit, blah blah blah.  Then whether he buys the item or not they have a cut away interview with him and he'll say, ""This time the price wasn't right so we couldn't make a deal.""

Old Man is the patriarch of the family and by far the best negotiator.  It does not matter what price the seller wants for an item, Old Man acts like he is offended, surprised, and automatically says ""no way.""  He is such a tough bargainer that I don't think I have ever seen him actually buy anything.  If it wasn't for Corey and Rick they would have an empty store.  Also, he keeps a big calendar by his desk so we know exactly the month of the show, so the Christmas show was going on and his calendar said ""October"".

Corey is the youngest and likable enough because he has so much disdain for the people who come in his pawn shop.  He is perpetually buying things that need massive restoration.  A guy will come in with a big block of aluminum with fiber glass sticking out of it and say it was an expensive plane that caught on fire and that if restored will be worth major money and he wants $4000.00 for it.  Then Corey will buy it for $5,000 and then we get the drama with his dad, Rick.  Then Rick will be in a cut away interview and act upset and be like ""Corey needs to learn that he can't buy crap like this."" And then Corey will say, ""But it will be worth a million dollars once we get it restored.""  Lulz.  I like the restorers though especially if it's a boat because then we see Bill the boat restorer who talks funny.  He will say:  ""Dish boat ish a clashick, back in da day dish was cutting edgish.""

Chumlee is reality TV comic relief driftwood.  People will bring in an item that is old like a record player or something and he will make the same Old Man is Old joke.  ""Hey Old Man, this guy has..um... your ... um.. childhood ipod here...huh huh.""  Anyway, best show on TV, check it out.",1266537600,35,2947,4.232974910394265
