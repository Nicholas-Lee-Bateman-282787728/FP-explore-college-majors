5679891,4,B00BX49CME,"If you've made it this far, you probably know about this lengthy documentary and the subject matter it deals with.  As a document of Holocaust survivors, participants and observers, ""Shoah"" does a fine job letting its participants share their stories.  A number of testimonies are simply jaw-dropping and need to be seen and heard.  Sadly, the format of this film can be a little irritating at times: there are several scenes where interview questions and their answers are translated from Hebrew, Yiddish and Polish, and some of this dialogue is not subtitled.  It's extremely awkward and hard to process at times, but most of the more direct conversations flow much more smoothly.

Of course, that's no fault of Criterion's Blu-ray, just the film itself.  Criterion has done a fantastic job with this release, pairing a new 4K transfer with a handful of supplements including bonus films by director Claude Lanzmann, new interviews and the like.  It's a fine package if you really like ""Shoah"" and will watch it more than once a year...but let's face it, most people won't.  Those who won't watch it often---or, of course, haven't seen it yet---may not get their money's worth from this $100 package.  It's just one of those films where once is probably enough.

5679892,5,B00BX49CME,"To anyone who may want to watch this film:

From Wikipedia: Shoah is a 1985 French documentary film directed by Claude Lanzmann about the Holocaust (a.k.a. Shoah). The film consists of his interviews with survivors and visits key Holocaust sites across Poland, including three extermination camps. He presents testimony from survivors, witnesses and bystanders, and perpetrators,including interviews with German personnel. You can read all about it at: http://bit.ly/Cl2K1

As one of the reviewers mentioned, this film is not ""entertainment"" in any sense of the word. The descriptions of what happened to the people that are interviewed are at once horrific, harrowing and upsetting. It is perhaps, so frightening that when released in 1985, Franois Mitterrand, the then President of France, attended the screening, after which the Polish government asked France to ban the film (according to the New Yorker - http://nyr.kr/yEcTmI).

Although unrated, I would not screen this film to anyone under 10. It is very disturbing. Others have used the words ""masterpiece"" and ""classic"" to describe this motion picture, I would prefer to say that it is, in my opinion one of the most profound historical documentaries ever made.",1370736000,26,1220,5.410526315789474

I experienced this film when it was originally released in the theaters many years ago. I consider it among the top 5 greatest films I have ever seen. It is long, deeply long and harrowing and demanding, and yet there are aspects and elements in it that go beyond anything I have seen in film. I can't believe it's finally on bluray and I am snapping it up before it disappears into the region of the bootleggers. Grab it!",1370476800,10,550,4.401960784313726

How true.

Shoah is literally the one film EVERYONE should see - ONCE!  (I doubt anyone could bear to sit through it a second time.  It's that powerful.)

And don't worry about graphic images.  There's actually none in the picture.  Instead it's a series of interviews with survivors, witnesses, by-standers, and even concentration camp guards.  Some of it is chilling, some of it is bleak, some of it is infuriating, all of it is POWERFUL!",1365552000,50,611,4.688679245283019

5679896,5,B00BX49CME,"By far the best documentary ever made about the indescribably, horrific annihilation of two thirds of Europe's Jewish population during the Second World War. Far more intense and realistic than the black and white footage shown in such classic works such as The World At War, SHOAH is also unique because it was produced entirely with private funds, has no archival footage, and was painstakingly filmed on location in Europe, specifically at the six major death camps in Poland and other major German and Polish cities, and also in Israel, and America with the actual survivors, witnesses, and perpetrators, many of whom were reluctant to reveal all that they knew. Claus Lanzmann, himself a Holocaust survivor, wrote, directed, and produced this masterwork of the greatest systematic genocide in the history of mankind with an eye to preserving truth and memory for future generations. A colossal achievement with more than ten hours of interviews, including eye-witness testimony from the late Polish aristocratic hero Jan Karski, and conversations with America's premier Holocaust historian Professor Raoul Hilberg. A testament for the ages that will surely, as has The Diary of Anne Frank, stand the test of time.",1484438400,,1218,5.283505154639175

5679906,4,B00BX49CME,"It is with misgivings and great reluctance that I give this film anything less than five stars.  It is such a monumental, and essential undertaking, that judging it as anything less than perfect seems somehow a denigration of its subject matter.  Compiled from over 300 hours of footage shot over ten years, the mere act of creating the film is deserving of adulation.  The director, Claude Lanzmann, frequently filmed under difficult conditions, using several translators, and in some cases, filming subjects without their knowledge.  Reportedly, when one of these discovered the camera, he attacked the director so viciously that Lanzmann had to be hospitalized.

It's not so much a documentary as testimony.  There are no scenes of historical reenactment, and the only subject matter expert who appears is the historian Raul Hilberg.  Filmed at the actual locations of many of the events discussed, we hear from the victims, the witnesses, and the perpetrators of the atrocities in Chelmno, Treblinka, Auschwitz, Warsaw, and other places.  Also missing is any context; documentaries from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nanook-Of-The-North/dp/B000KJTC7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nanook Of The North</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garlic-Is-As-Good-As-Ten-Mothers/dp/6302449332/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garlic Is As Good As Ten Mothers</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incident-at-Oglala/dp/B0001FVDI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incident at Oglala</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Hair/dp/B002TOJOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Hair</a>&nbsp;assume that the viewer may be completely unfamilar with the film's subject, so a good amount of screen time is spent in explanation and background.  There's not a moment of this in ""Shoah"" - nothing about the Nazi Party or Hitler's rise to power, and only incidentally about World War Two raging in the background - it starts with the death trains and ends with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.  It assumes that the viewer is already familiar with the context, and will look elsewhere for this background if they require it.

While unusual for a documentary, in this case Lanzmann may be on safe ground in assuming his audiences familiarity with the milieu; World War Two is a cultural icon by now.  It seems not a year goes by without another World War Two movie, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hyper-realistic-battlefield-dramas/dp/B00OLI7D3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">hyper-realistic battlefield dramas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/little-known-stories/dp/B00005JK8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">little-known stories</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/lesser-known-stories/dp/B00DL48BM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">lesser-known stories</a>, and of course&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holocaust-dramas/dp/B00B0U2SFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holocaust dramas</a>.  ""Shoah,"" then, provides the specific human details of a story we should know already.  It's not an easy watch; the descriptions of relentless suffering and brutality can be exhausting.  In several scenes, Lanzmann must command the speakers to continue; the importance of their testimony outweighs their own discomfort in giving it.  This approach, of showing the Holocaust's effect on individual lives, gives the stories a personal impact, but the absence of context presents the people of Poland, where most of the action takes place, as mostly ignorant bystanders or even abettors (with the exception of one professor who attempted to bring aid to the Warsaw Ghetto).  This criticism could be leveled at Art Spiegelman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maus/dp/0679748407/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maus</a>&nbsp;as well.  In reality, the ""Righteous Among Nations"" in Israel, that commemorates non-Jews who risked their lives to assist Jews during the Holocaust, includes more Poles than any other nationality.

The greatest criticism that I can level at ""Shoah"" is its length.  Although shorter than the average television season, at over nine hours, it's definitely long for a movie.  I understand that Lanzmann had to make choices as to what to discard in order to winnow his material down even to this length, and undoubtedly many important stories were left out.  The problem is that the film's length makes it a serious commitment for the viewer.  I'm no documentarian, but surely there must have been a way to cut it down even further, to a more accessible length.  If Lanzmann's goal was to preserve the participants' testimonies, he succeeded - the hundreds of hours of footage he recorded will provide material for scholars and historians for generations.  But the general public cannot be expected to absorb the material to this degree, nor should they have to.  The documentarian's job is to present something to us that we did not know about before.  I cannot help but think that the film's length unnecessarily limits its audience; if so, this is a serious failure.  As the Holocaust recedes further into the past, the record of eyewitness testimony is vital.  Every year, fewer living people recall these events as participants.  The film deserves as wide an audience as possible, and may not be reaching it if it's viewed as a marathon, or at least more of a test of endurance than it has to be.",1462924800,3,5684,6.652232746955345

It's an eminently engaging, at times soul-harrowing film that almost never flags or lapses into redundancy over its staggering 9 hour duration. In his refusal to use any archival footage, voice-overs from 'talking head' experts or cheap emotion-rousing soundtracks, in his total use of location film and interviews with survivors, witnesses and perpetrators, Claude Lanzmann did the inconcievable: his film brings the Holocaust down from the realm of a mythic nightmare, and situates it, quite literally, in the spaces where it occurred. He makes it part of our reality again, and in doing so, he shows how much more unknowable, how much stranger and deeper the absence of so many lives lost is. Shoah is, clearly a masterpiece. And like any masterpiece its way of looking at the world bleeds out of its subject to interrogate broader ideas, specifically about history, loss and the eerie but final untransmitability of human suffering and experience. Lanzmann has found a way to make the unspeakable, the incommunicable, the impossible itself, however briefly, tangible.  Shoah should be required viewing for any human being living in the modern world.",1373760000,3,1261,5.242574257425742

The first two discs the Subtitles worked very well. the third disc did not play with  Subtitles at all. The set up mode said it was on but did not show  during playback.

5679943,5,B00BX49CME,"I've been waiting to get my hands on Shoah for years. If it was ever on sale I wasn't looking at the time and otherwise wasn't up for shelling out the dough, nor going to the rare screening. It's a film I always wanted to take in alone.

I finished watching the film last night and had one of the most insane nightmares of all time thereafter. The strangest part about this lucid nightmare was that the landscape and texture of the dream were consctructed unconsciously by the stories shared in Shoah - And that I realized, after sleeping, the beauty of Shoah is that the sweeping, vivid narrative dialect of survivors and scholars paints a picture impossible to not have burned into one's mind. It is the nightmare to end all nightmares - not only the Holocaust, but the colossal burden of living afterwards, having witnessed the unfathomable extent of the Western human animal.

The dream got me thinking, too, what separated Shoah from other documentaries save its length ? - The lack of archival footage sets an obscure finalized tone - seldom seen in Holocaust documentaries - on the present state of these witnesses.

Shoah is a mind-blowingly triumphant quiet film on the remembrances of Holocaust survivors and scholars. The reissuing of Shoah also goes on to show viewers and budding documentaries alike how needless all the hypsersaturated news reels and silent clips and video-recorded mountains of corpses can be in the light of a well-thought out documentary using minimalistic sound and vision.

It should be seem by everyone with any interest in human relations as well as historians. I have watched this on VHS, DVD and now this astonishing Blu-ray and it never flags.
The picture quality is significantly improved over the DVD which was vastly better than the VHS! Considering its age and the way in which it was filmed it could hardly be better. The image is also 1.37:1 and although it does not sound a lot it looks much larger than the 1.33:1 DVD. Sound is clear and subtitles crisp and well translated from the many languages spoken: French, Polish, German, Yiddish, Russian, Italian, Lithuanian, Hebrew amongst others. My only complaint is the policy of Criterion to not subtitle when English is spoken. Fortunately there is not a lot of English in this series but not to subtitle it is just stupid as it is so heavily accented it is almost another language. Someone in Criterion needs to wake up!
The booklet is very informative if not quite as informative as the huge booklet that came with my Masters of Cinema DVD set.

5679945,5,B00BX49CME,"""Shoah"", the biblical world translates to ""calamity"" and in Hebrew, it is the term to describe the Holocaust, the genocide of six million Jews during World War II by Nazi Germany.

The word is also the title of French filmmaker Claude Lanzmann's 1985 nine and a half hour documentary, an oral history of the Holocaust.  A documentary hailed as one of the greatest and most important documentaries ever made, others calling it a masterpiece and a film that has been critically praised worldwide.

The film would win ""Best Documentary"" and win the ""Special Award"" at the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and would win ""Best Documentary"" at the National Society of Film Critics Awards and International Documentary Association.

And now this epic and important documentary, ""Shoah"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD for the first time in the United States courtesy of The Criterion Collection.

In 1974, Lanzmann began working on his film.  The first six years of production featured the recording of interviews of individuals from 14 countries.  Lanzmann worked on the interviews for four years before going to Poland and edited the film for five years, editing from 350 hours of raw footage down to 9 1/2 hours for the final cut.

The film are featured in three parts, ""The First Era, Part One"", ""The First Era, Part Two"" and ""Second Era"".

VIDEO:

Having owned the 2010 Masters of Cinema release of ""Shoah"" which featured a director-approved edition of a new progressive transfer, it's important to note that the Criterion Collection of ""Shoah"" features a new digital master produced from a restoration undertaken in 2012-2013 by the Cinetica di Bologna in Italy.

Two things I will comment on is that the film uses archived footage from various sources to footage that was  shot back in 1974 to 1980.  While picture quality will differ in some areas, one thing I noticed differently with the HD release of ""Shoah"" from the Criterion Collection is much more detail, cleaner presentation without the white specks and problems with certain frames that were seen in the 2010 DVD release.  Colors look much better, detail is much more evident and where the 2010 DVD featured much more grain (and noise), the 2013 version looks much better, sharper and with more detail.

According to the Criterion Collection, ""the transfer was created in 4K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original 16 mm camera negative at L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna.  The restoration was then performed in 2K resolution at L'Immagine Ritrovata using Image Systems' Phoenix and DaVinci's Revival software, to address image stabilization, flicker, dirt, debris, and spark.  Finally, the scans were color-corrected at Eclair Laboratories in Epinay-sur-Seine, France, under the supervision of Caroline Champetier, who served as assistant camera person on Shoah.  During this process, using a 35 mm prince as a reference, Champetier regraded every shot, with a minimum of reframing and sharpening and without masking.""

AUDIO/SUBTITLES:

""Shoah"" is presented in LPCM 1.0 monaural and dialogue driven is clear and understandable.  No hiss, crackle, or anything terrible.

According to the Criterion Collection, ""The soundtrack was scanned at L'Immagine Ritrovata from the original 16 mm negative soundtracks on a Chase Optical Sound Processor, preserving the monaural mix.  Sound mixer Gerald Lamps supervised the minimal restoration of the soundtrack, which was performed for noise reduction and to address occasional dropouts.""

The film is presented in French, Italian, Polish, German, English, Hebrew and Yiddish with English subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

My first time watching ""Shoah"" several years ago, it was difficult.

Each time you watch a documentary about the Holocaust, you think you have learned all you can about the atrocities, that you have learned about the anguish, despair that took place at the death camps, at the forests, inside the trains.

But when I watched ""Shoah"", the documentary reminded me that for every person that lived at that time, those who escaped from the camps, those who survived the camps that were left for dead, those who lived by the camps and those who were involved in the murder of millions, you realize that it is not possible to know everything.

""Shoah"" was a film that I regard as a masterpiece.  Not because it focused on the holocaust but how director Claude Lanzmann persevered in getting the interviews from survivors, villagers and how far he went into getting interviews from those who were Nazi's that worked in the death camps.

This is a documentary that began in 1974, filmed in 14 countries, trimmed to 9 1/2 hours with over hundreds of hours of footage.  Footage that managed to get people to discuss their memories of one of the most difficult events in their lives and document it.  And within those eleven years of making the documentary, some of those interviewed were no longer alive by the release of the final cut of the film.

Unlike Alain Resnais' 1955 film ""Night and Fog"" that used images of people's faces before they were massacred, people starved and left to die, images of mountains of hair shaved off people's heads, skin from those who died or tortured and now were being used for artwork and soap.  Images of people being bulldozed, burned to death, people with their flesh rotting, heads that were removed from their bodies, torture chambers and more.  ""Shoah"" is not that type of film.

Resnais' use of these graphic images is where the intended goal was for the audience to witness inhumanity.  Humanity at its worse and you are just sickened to your stomach and haunted by these images because you are literally in disbelief that these terrible things were done.

With ""Shoah"", it's a buildup of recollections from people who lived in areas where Jewish thrived but also areas where concentration camps were created and we get a better understanding from eyewitnesses who saw the trains come to their village and how they tried to warn them.  We learn from those who survived about having to get the dead or their ashes and clean things up, discovering friends and also loved ones and whichever year these interviews were recorded, decades after World War II, the memories still haunt them, still hurt them and as a viewer today, you can't help but feel heartbroken and sickened by how the innocent were tricked or how some were abused before they were to be killed.

From the men and women taken to gas camps and were buried and then burned.  To the children and elderly walked to a middle of the field until they saw nothing, until they got closer and saw the pit of the dead and for them being shot behind the neck and being killed.

From the day I first saw this documentary and watching it again, not only does it bring me chills, not only does it make me want to cry and get angry, it is completely devastating to learn the evil and dark side of humanity and with many people interviewed for ""Shoah"", knowing that these are just a few stories that were told but yet there are many stories that have yet to be told or never will be told as over 70-years have passed since then.

It was one thing to watch the heartbreaking news of how many died or committed suicide but then to hear from villagers who were racists towards the Jewish people of their city and possibly one of the most damning interviews in a documentary, Claude Lanzmann's interview with Nazi Franz Suchomel who seemed so proud of what he did, as if he worked with honor and felt no remorse as he discussed how people died with such pomposity.

Needless to say, there are many moments of thought-provoking answers to Lanzmann's questions but one can't help but be amazed that Lanzmann was able to get such an interview from a Nazi perspective.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""Shoah"", as mentioned earlier, I owned the 2010 Masters of Cinema UK DVD set of ""Shoah"" but having watched the Criterion Collection release, there really is no comparison as the Criterion Collection version of ""Shoah"" is a 5-star release.

From better picture quality thanks to its 2012-2013 digital restoration and 4K scan, picture quality is much clearer, much better and less noisy and cleaner without the white specks.  Colors are much better to look at and the dialogue features no hiss or hum, pops or crackle, the documentary looks incredible and sounds very good!

But as ""Shoah"" is a masterpiece, this Blu-ray release from the Criterion Collection is essentially a grand slam because also included are Lanzmann's three other films.

""A Visitor from the Living"" about Maurice Rossel, a Swiss Red Cross member who wrote a positive report about how Jewish were free and it was a safe-haven for Jewish people, but in truth, the Nazi prepared and were trained how to act when the Red Cross inspectors arrived.  But more surprising is Rossel's comments in the interview and all I can say is prepare to be shocked.  I was left speechless by this film.  Words can not describe my anger after hearing Rossel's comments.

""Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4p.m."" is Lanzmann's film about Yehuda Lerner who participated in the uprising in the Sobribor camp, which was discussed towards the later part of the ""Shoah"" documentary but an incredible testament to hope and how this uprising was executed.  Another fantastic film included in the ""Shoah"" release!

""The Karski Report"" which is a film that was created to refute Yannick Haenel's novel but feature more of the interviews with Jan Karski from 1975.  We learn about this in ""Shoah"" but even more detail especially the political side of Karski trying to reach out to the international community about what the Nazi's did to the Jews.  Another important film from Claude Lanzmann and so glad for its inclusion on the Blu-ray release.

The interviews with Lanzmann are also featured on the Blu-ray.  Most shocking is the ""On Shoah"" 2013 interview which is exclusive to the Criterion Collection release in which Lanzmann discusses how he got Franz Suchomel (the Nazi) on ""Shoah"".  A fascinating interview!  Also, is the ""2003 interview in which Lanzmann talks about ""A Visitor from the Living"" and """"Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4p.m.""

And you also get an interview between Caroline Champetier (the camera operator for ""Shoah"") and filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin plus a 62-page booklet.

Overall, this is the best documentary release I have seen from The Criterion Collection.  Not only do you get Claude Lanzmann's epic, very important and groundbreaking 1985 documentary ""Shoah"" but you also get three more important Claude Lanzmann films included in this Blu-ray release as well.
