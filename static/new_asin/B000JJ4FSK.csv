I knew something was off the moment I pressed play on the DVD player.  The menu screen pops up, and we hear the sounds of a wailing ELECTRIC guitar, soloing for over 6 minutes.  The DVD itself clocks in at only 40 minutes, and 6 of those minutes are dedicated to how to change a string.  While playing, McCarthy often makes mistakes.  He doesn't even bother to explain how you must always be seated while playing the classical, and how it should always be played upright on the left knee.  He plays on his right knee for the length of the lessons, as if the guitar was an acoustic.
