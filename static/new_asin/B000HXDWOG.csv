2648298,5,B000HXDWOG,"""Shinobi-Heart Under Blade,"" is a fun and entertaining film. Suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for the film; and if you have viewed Azumi 1 & 2, or Takeshi Kitano's film ""The Blindswordman Zatoichi,"" then you will enjoy this film. I was given this film by a friend as a Christmas present, and just recently viewed it; and I must write that I found it highly enjoyable. There is CGI in the film, but it did not bother me, considering the abilities of the various ninja's depicted in the film would more or less require its use. Also, the story itself is based from Japanese manga, called ""Basilisk."" And although I have not had a chance to look at these, I might someday. Just thought that I would pass this along.

The film is set in 17th-century Japan. In the film there are two Shinobi ninja tribes whose villages have been at war for hundreds of years. The two tribes are called the IGA and the KOUGA. They have been forced to obey a decree by the Shogun who has unified Japan, and therefore has outlawed these two factions from fighting. Two of the ninja's from the different tribal clans have fallen in love: They are Oboro (Yukie Nakama) and Gennosuke (Jo Odagiri) however, both must keep it a secret. The Shogun however, sees the danger that these two warring ninja clans are to him, and decides that a tournament be held. Five ninja warriors from each of the two clans must face off in a battle to the death. These different ninja characters are extremely colorful. Each possess an ability in fighting that makes this film interesting. As I wrote in the beginning, this is not an Akira Kurosawa type film, such as ""Seven Samurai,"" therefore, suspension of disbelief is necessary.

Moreover, you will not find the depth of character development in this film that you would in a Kurosawa film: so what! the film is a fun watch anyway. I would have liked to have seen more a bit more depth in the characters in the film, however, I can live with this, as the film was entertaining enough for me to enjoy. However, the acting in the film is very good. Since the film comes from comic and anime origins, the characters do not disappoint the viewer. The film seems a bit comic-book at times, but that is one of the reasons I think I enjoyed the film so much more. And besides, the visuals I believe were done incredibly great. Also, while not like your typical Japanese film, in terms of swordplay, the film is still enjoyable: remember this does derive from Manga.

In the film these two ninja clans that send their ninjas understand the implications of their fight: the winners will serve the Shogunate, the loser will be vanquished. All of the fights take place while enroute to the capital, while the leader of one of the clans tries to persuade the emperor to change his mind. (Jo Odagiri) and (Yukie Nakama) give good acting performances in the film, which in turn makes this a better film. Once can see clearly that this film is adapted from 'Romeo and Juliet,' to some degree. Once again, this is an enjoyable Japanese film, not to be taken seriously, or on par with some of the great Samurai epics of the past, just an enjoyably entertaining film. Also, I thought some of the characters' powers were very interesting, as it departs so much from much of Japanese cinema, in contrast to Chinese cinema, where this is so prevalent. All in all, a delightful and fun film. Enjoy it, and don't take it too seriously. [Stars: 4.5]",1168732800,10,3450,4.561290322580645
2648299,2,B000HXDWOG,"This movie was disappointing. This is the live action version based on the popular Japanese manga ""Basilisk: The Kouga Ninja scrolls"" and the anime of the same name. Two hours isn't long enough to flesh out the characters and deliver a movie that lives up to the anime version.",1168473600,,277,4.673469387755102
2648300,3,B000HXDWOG,"By simply looking at the visuals of the DVD cover, it's plain obvious that it's catering for the younger audience.  What astounds me even more is that rather than relying on the strength of stories and subtleties that Japanese movies are known for, Shinobi is an all-out action movie with emphasis on special effects (inspired by Lords of the Ring Trilogy), a hybrid of divide and conquer storyline, Romeo & Juliet fatal love story, and X-Men.  As readers would have read from other reviews, there are two opposing clans with special powers and they are nemesis for four centuries.  The old adages about fear of the unknown and the propensity of those in power to keep holding on to their power would induce the Shogun to manipulate the clans to fight to their deaths.  Whilst the special effects are okay, we probably couldn't empathise too much with those special warriors because they are given too little screen time other than to display their prowess to move the movies along.  Much screen time is given to the two main characters or love interests in this movie, Gonnosuke and Oboro.  This movie, in a way, is a milestone for Japanese movie-making because it moves towards a drastically new direction in contrast with the Kurosawa's genre.  Commendable watching.",1162080000,,1269,4.874418604651162
2648301,5,B000HXDWOG,"The dvd of SHINOBI HEART UNDER BLADE U.S. version is almost an exact duplicate of the Region-3 Thai version. I have both the 3-disc Japanese region-2 copy and the Hong Kong Region-3 DTS-ES dvd. The japanese and Hk releases have the best transfers. If you have multi-region capability, buy the Japanese or Hong Kong versions. But whatever you do, do not miss this film.

 The following review applies to the Hong Kong Region-3 release:

I just finished watching my dvd copy of this film and felt that I have to review this marvelously tragic but hopeful film. Mind you, this SHINOBI film does not follow any of the video-game inspired Shinobi titles, rather it is based on the JAPANESE FEUDAL LEGEND from which both the video game and the anime series ""Basilisk"" were based on.

In order for you to love this film, you have to have an idea of Japanese customs and their unrelenting loyalty to their emperor/leader. For them, their Emperor is like a living God-man. That is why when a new Shogunate has united feudal Japan, he fears that the wrath of the SHINOBI may upset the balance of power. SHINOBI is the elite NINJA clan, who has been trained since birth in the art of combat and warfare.

Two Ninja clans has had a truce for years that the new Lord of the shogunate has lifted this truce and has misled them into believing that each clan will help decide who will ascend to the role of shogun(in the future) should they have 5 of their greatest and most skilled warriors to battle each other in a contest to the death. Gennusuke and Oboro are the lovers caught in the middle because each have ascended to the role of chieftain in their respective clans. In truth, the Shogunate rulers wish to destroy their clans because they fear their powers/skills and that one day rise up against the Supreme Shogunate of Japan. They believe since their goal is peace and prosperity, war mongers should be extinct because they believe that without war, they have no purpose. Some members of the clans also believe this.

Each clan warrior has character and depth, with variable skills and abilities. One warrior is like a chameleon, one has simian-like agility, one has NEAR-immortality, a woman has poison that goes around her skin/breath, one is a blind psychic among others.

The film itself is very tragic and when Oboro makes the supreme sacrifice to save the children/families of both clans, even the shogunate had to believe that the SHINOBI can have more than one purpose in life.

The set designs were awesome and the characters were well designed. The special effects weren't all hokey and fit the movie's pace. As in most samurai films, the battles were quick and exciting, although not overly bloody.

The film is one of the best ASIAN fantasy-epic films I've seen thus far. The dvd I have was mastered in High-def widescreen(EXTREMELY SHARP transfer) with 5.1 (DTS)digital audio(I didn't get mind in AMAZON). I highly recommend this film, now I have to cry for a PREQUEL about the warring clans before! 4.5 stars all the way!!
Kagero ROCKS!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

ADDED: I managed to see the U.S. region-1 release by Funimation. It is less than 2 minutes shorter than the region-3 DTS-ES Hong Kong release. Nothing relevant was missing, except for an extended beginning and Oboro's encounter with one of the Kouga warriors. The video of the Asian release is a lot sharper/crisper than the Funimation transfer. As I thought, the Funimation transfer was derived from the Thai version.",1161216000,54,3486,4.775747508305648
2648302,4,B000HXDWOG,"Shinobi is a Romeo & Juliet style tragic love story, but is full of interesting characters and concepts that seem to have been taken ala carte from various anime/manga and myth sources.

Each of the ninjas in this movie have a special characteristic or power that defines them.  Some familiar character concepts will be Kagero, the ninja girl who has been fed poison all her life so that even her kiss is deadly...reminiscent of Ninja Scroll.  There is an immortal who appears to have blood worms ala Blade of the Immortal, etc.  Most likely you will not find anything original in this movie in terms of plot or characters.

However, the production values, the action and the acting are definately well done.  It's interesting to see such a variety of crossed over characters from various Ninja genres all gathered together and forced to fight it out.

A word to the wise, Amazon marketplace vendors are selling a Taiwanese version of this movie which has some unusual formatting.  You may find that the disc will not play in most standalone DVD players.  I was only able to get the DVD to play in my PS2 and my computer, both of my stand-alones rejected it.  The menus are in Chinese, the dialogue in original Japanese, but the English subtitles are well done, if a bit off in translation.",1153094400,3,1290,4.668141592920354

But the premise of the film was so unique, and I love the special effects.  The fighting scenes were inventive and spectacular, and there was an elegant beauty to them.  They were so creative, and I enjoyed the character's individual talents.

Two warring clans, who are skilled, and the government is afraid of them.  They are invited to select five of their best skilled warriors in a duel.  But of course, what no one seems to know is that leader's children from each clan are in love.

Again, I didn't like the ending of the film.  I didn't like the way it was written, and I didn't think Yukie Nakama's performance did justice to this film.

2648377,5,B000HXDWOG,"I first saw Shinobi with a half-Japanese friend of mine who was not really into martial arts, but who had fallen in love with this movie. He wanted me to watch it too, and I did. Like him, I also fell in love with it. I am not big into martial arts and I expected to be bored out of my mind while watching this, but I was quickly sucked in to the intricate, multi-layered story line. All throughout this movie I kept wondering if it was truly live-action or if it was just exceptionally well-done animation and to this day I still don't know which is true. It reminds me of one of the Final Fantasy movies I watched with my parents, the one where the girl has to find the last living essences of spirit that are lurking in an otherwise dead world. I don't remember what that movie was called but I loved it as well, and it haunted my dreams for years.

Back to Shinobi. I think it's the love story, and the agonizing struggle of duty and honor vs love that continues to draw me back to Shinobi, time and time again. It's a nice touch that each of the five (six?) warriors chosen by the rival competing teams have different strengths, and outside of the two who participate in the demonstration for the Shogun, we don't get to see what that specific character's strength is until they actually fight with it.

The imagery is also stunning. After watching this and other movies set in Japan, I REALLY want to visit, if only just to view the spectacular natural scenery. The only thing that I would change about Shinobi would be to add more depth to the characters, especially the two main leads. The female lead seems indifferent to her love at most times throughout the movie, while her male counterpart is far more demonstrative. Or maybe she's distant because she's sad at the knowledge that their love is ultimately doomed.

Either way, this is a lovely movie, and one of my all-time favorites. I've had the hardest time finding it on DVD or Netflix, so I'm just going to order my own copy and be done with it.",1395360000,,2012,4.374331550802139

The movie isn't horrible, not in the least, the special effects are pretty decent and it's over all a great action film, BUT when it comes to the actual storyline based in the anime (or manga) the two just don't compare. I understand that only so much can be put into a film that's less than two hours long, and a live action one at that. I say if you really want to fall in love with the storyline and it's characters, watch the anime it's so worth it.",1343088000,,533,3.9444444444444446
2648404,3,B000HXDWOG,"To me the Cinematography, costumes, hair and make-up, fight scenes and magnificent scenery of Japan carried this movie. The characters looked very good but in reality were very one dimensional, the plot was extremely weak and the computer special effects were somewhat lacking. I did not feel much chemistry between the two main characters, it would also have been nice if they would have thrown in one true love scene between the two when they married each other. I was originally drawn to watch this movie because Jo Odagiri was in it and I had seen him in a movie called Plastic City in which he played a much more flushed out character who I felt much more deeply about than his character in Shinobi Heart Under Blade. I love Japanese movies but unfortunately I had to watch this movie with dubbing which I always feel takes so much away from the aucthenticity of foreign films. If I cannot watch them in their original language with subtitles then something is always missing for me. I thought the dubbing dialogue in this movie was weak although not as cheesy as some dubbed movies I have watched. I have many Japanese movies in my Asian DVD library but I do not think this is one I will be buying or one which I would bother watching again unless I buy it just to hear it with it's original Japanese dialogue soundtrack. I give it 3.4 stars.",1335657600,,1348,4.528688524590164
2648415,3,B000HXDWOG,"This reminded me very much of House of Flying Daggers, although I enjoyed this a bit more.  Both movies have beautiful cinematography and great actions scenes.  This movie had a little better acting and thus the extra star.

Honestly, I don't understand why these Japanese film makers cannot produce a decent plot.  For so many reviewers to give these movies 5 stars and say the visuals are so awesome that a plot is not needed is ridiculous.  I do not consider myself that particular in this area but seriously, this plot has monumental errors.  Let me give just a few examples...

***Warning: Spoilers Ahead***

1) We are made to believe that the two protagonists are deeply in love with each other.  Both are summoned to fight in front of the emperor with their respective teams.  Yet the female attacks the male on the journey and he allows her to kill him.  Prior to this, the male character learns that a member of the female team named Tenzen has betrayed them and both of their villages are under attack while they are away.  Wouldn't our male protagonist say to his love, ""Dear, we should go and defend our villages instead of me allowing you to kill me""?

2) As mentioned above, Tenzen betrays both villages by revealing their locations to the emperor.  Yet there is no scene regarding this activity or any motivation by Tenzen for his betrayal.  In addition, wouldn't the emperor already know of the location of the villages since at the beginning of the movie, he summons the elders of each village to demonstrate their skills?

3) So now we have the villages under attack.  These villages are supposed to be populated with amazing Shinobi warriors and yet when they are attacked by the emperor's forces, they run around like idiots with no fighting abilities whatsoever.  In addition, the emperor manages to sneak up on the village with cannons and  heavy infantry without being seen or heard, even though the village is in the cliff above them and could easily spot them a mile away.  Remember, these villages are at war.  You would think that there would be at least one sentry posted.

4) Finally the female begs the emperor to spare the villages and somehow the emperor manages to send this message to the attacking forces before they destroy the small village, something which appears like it would take about an hour to achieve.  How does the message get all the way from the emperor located in the capital city to the hidden village in such a short time before the village is destroyed?  If the village and the city are such a short distance apart, then how could they have been hidden in the first place?

And folks, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Again, it is like the producer said, ""We have all of these cool computer effects so let us write a story to demonstrate our amazing capabilities"".  Sorry but that is no way to make a movie and it really is too bad because this could have been a great film.

By the way, the only thing that this story has in common with Romeo and Juliet is the two protagonists from families that hate each other.  The story and the ending are completely different.",1329091200,2,3124,4.588447653429603

I think I would have been way more impressed with this movie had I not ever seen Basilisk or if the movie had followed that storyline a bit more closely but since I have I kept getting the feeling like this movie was lacking because it didn't really bring anything intensely original to the story nor did it play to fans of the series so it was kind of in the middle. I have to say that the ending 20 to 30 minutes are probably the best but for the most part it just seemed like Japan wanted an excuse to put Ayumi Hamasaki in a movie. Considering it is done by Funimation (who also produces Basilisk) I wasn't expecting too much so I bought it from a second hand vendor for way cheaper than Amazon's listing price. All in all I say save your self the time and just buy Basilisk.,1309219200,,963,4.047120418848167
2648420,5,B000HXDWOG,"While the other user here's comment is notable, that it does not state that it is dubbed in English, I find it deplorable that because of this one reason he rated such an excellent movie 1 star.. This is an injustice to this great movie..  I know that we lazy Americans want a one-stop-shop so we expect to find 100% of the info we need here on Amazon when renting a movie, but even though Amazon didn't include that one detail of information.. I mean.. Come on... It's a foreign film (of Japanese culture I believe?) and most all foreign films are either entirely or partially in their native language.  If you really want to be a bugger about it, then pop open a new window, hit up [], type in for example ""Shinobi Heart Under Blade,"" the IMDB will come up in the first few listings, click on it and look for language and subtitles.  Takes less than one minute..

Okay.. Rant over.. This is an amazing movie, absolutely amazing.  It is a great martial arts movie with a few aspects of wire-fu (i.e. Hero, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, etc.) and the rest of plain old martial arts, but good martial arts!  The fight scenes are awesome.  There is a Romeo and Juliet type love story as well for the romantics.  The two featured on the cover are the heirs to each of the two Shinobi tribes which have always warred with one another, more particularly now so that there is peace among the land and their culture knows nothing but fighting.  The movie has aspects of mysticism as well, almost sci-fi.  There are some parts that seem to hint or directly imply magic, and other parts that feel like a foreign X-Men film.  The back story and primary story is worthy of a classic foreign epic.  Maybe not in the top best of all time, but definitely one of the better.  (I watch a lot of foreign films and this movie ranks up there with the best I've seen in this year next to The Warlords with Jet Li, Red Cliff, and IP Man).

So maybe this will help any moviegoers interested in a great movie with a variety easily appealing to all genders, ages and races.

2648422,4,B000HXDWOG,"My wife and I decided to watch this after seeing a preview for it. A word of warning.  As with many previews, you got the impression of an action film that was mostly combat.  It would be a profound disappointment for anyone expecting that, as it has both plot and a rich historical and cultural background that is often lacking from action films.

We had both seen and love ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and enjoyed ""The House of Flying Daggers.""  This movie lies somewhere between the two, and should not disappoint if you let it stand on its own instead of judging it on the manga on which it is based.  The cinematography and scenery is absolutely gorgeous, and rates at least two stars.  The combat sequences are excellent, amazingly so given the moderate budget this film had.  The film could not climb much above three stars if that was all it had.  However, it also has a story, that is both solid and at times, clever.

The story does not exactly translate into the neat category of ""tragedy"" (and of course ""comedy"") that Western literature often falls into.  However, the world it occurs in is very different.  This is the Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, when the Tokegawa Shogunate was established and began a reign of peace, stability, and stagnation that would last over 200 years.

The Shinobi are mystical warriors who have thrived on the conflicts of the preceding centuries.  They no longer fit in this world of peace, yet there is no simple way to deal with them.  The movie revolves around this conflict, between the two conflicting Shinobi clans and the new Japan that has no place for them.  From these basic ideas the plot of the movie flows, and it does it quite well.  It helps to understand some of the basics of Japanese culture, from the reverence for the authority (the Shogun in this case as the representative of the Emperor though the Shogun is actually in charge - as I said, this is Japan) to the omnipresent, and sometimes suffocating, sense of obligation that pervaded the culture, and how Japan has had to deal with seismic cultural shifts many times in the past.

There are not plot spoilers here, everything is explained fairly well during the first 20 or 30 minutes.  The story is a love story, caught within a web of obligation, destiny, and fate that makes it doomed from the start.  Kouga Gennosuke refuses to accept this, and heroically struggles against the obligations and tradition that require him to see his true love, Oboro, as the enemy since she is from the opposing clan.  She is more fatalistic, and the film takes this love and sets against not just this conflict but the determination of the Shogunate that the Shinobi represent a threat to the new peace that has been established.  To solve this ""problem"", the Shogunate decides to require the five strongest warriors from each clan to fight to the death, with the winning side determining the next Shogun.

The movie takes off from there.  There are numerous combats as Kouga Gennosuke tries to prevent, and when he is unable to do this, limit the carnage from the challenge.  Of course, being feudal Japan, the machinations of those in charge are a backdrop that continues to add more and more complexity that is revealed as the remainder of the film progresses.  If you are unfamiliar with the orignal anime, you are never quite sure if the two lovers will escape their fate.  The ending caught us by surprise.  It is neither ""happy"" nor ""tragic"" in the context of Japan and it's culture.  Instead there is a unexpected twist as these warriors, rejected by the new era, give their people one last chance, with a sacrifice and surrender that is profound, and uncommon in Western cinema.",1296518400,,3707,4.679012345679013
2648423,3,B000HXDWOG,"Ah, sweet memories of playing Shinobi while at home sick from school. I've always been fascinated with ninjas and the culture surrounding them, when I was younger this fascination expressed itself through video games, and now that I'm older it's done through books, movies, and anime. There are quite a bit of movies about Ninjas, some good; some horrible... this one falls towards the good end. From the beginning you'll notice this film is very visually stylized... there is plenty of slow motion, bright colors, and CG. I quite enjoyed the look of the film, even though you're going to have to forgive some of the special effects; they're passable but nowhere near big budget Hollywood quality.

The story is pretty intriguing, and involves what can best be summarized as a forbidden romance during a time of struggle between two clans. I was surprised that there was a great humanistic message hidden here within all the swordplay, which towards the end gets driven home pretty hard. Many of the shinobi in the movie have really cool unique powers, and it makes the movie a lot of fun in my opinion. Overall I was pretty pleased... if you go into this one with modest expectations you'll enjoy it. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but it does what it should well. 3.5/5 stars.",1294272000,,1284,4.836363636363636

2648435,3,B000HXDWOG,"I enjoyed the Basilisk Anime and was surprised there was a live movie based on it. The reason I bothered to check this title out is because I was curious to see how they adapted such a well written and greatly animated series into a movie. Basilisk is a pretty heavy anime with a very mature theme of hatred,love,regret,and despair. I had to see how they would be able to fit such a story into 75 minutes or so.

 I will say that this movie has done one thing for me, and that is appreciate the anime more. I understand that the reason the anime made me angry at the end was because it ended and I wanted more of it. Matter of fact that's the problem with Basilisk/Shinobi. It's over before it even starts. Characters are introduced and then killed off before they even have time to develop. In the anime this happens early on but as the story progresses you get to learn more about the characters fighting but when they die you still feel a connection to them. You honestly don't want anyone to die but it's inevitable. The 400 year long grudge can't be erased so easily.

I was disappointed that this movie didn't show the conflict between each character and express their emotions enough. In the anime the characters disagree with their leader but they try to get them to see things their way. They instigate the fighting and go against their leaders. They don't just rush into the battle not even when forced too matter of fact they don't do anything until the very end. I was a bit surprised that Oboro's character was completely removed from how she is supposed to be. She doesn't have the heart to hurt anyone out of hate or revenge. The only time she uses her power is when she is force to use it. Meaning that the one she loved was put in danger and she had to use it to save him.

The movie was like I thought it would be. It skipped A LOT of the story and to me it just seemed like scenes in the movie had just been cut out as the story jumped around. I didn't mind so much that they changed the sequence of events,or certain characters. If Kagerou acted and dressed like she really does in the anime she this movie would of been NC-17. It was that I did mind where they skimped the story by not showing the love and passion Kagerou had for Gennosuke. Even though she knew she could never be with him. There were also little things like how Gennosuke's character was changed completely. He's actually a mild manner guy who thinks cautiously and wisely. In the movie his a mix of a hothead,mild mannered guy,and someone completely confused about what he wants to do. In Oboro's camp it's Tenzen that runs the show and Oboro is more of the dog on the leash as she has no control over what her party does. Gennosuke has (some)control over his party. They only fight by going behind his back, and they act the part of listening to and following him. They understand that he doesn't want to fight, but they will still do what they fell is necessary. They will not go against him and disrespect him in his presence.

I just never got that feeling watching the movie. The characters personalities just seemed a bit off. Now I'm not going to compare and contrast the two there's really no point to do that any further they are similar but very different still. Those are just a few examples on how the movie differs from the anime itself.

The movie contains elements of the basilisk plot and the characters, but it misses out on a lot and in the end carries on into something else that strayed away from the anime. The movie suffered from Miss casted characters and a strong lack of character development. There was a plot but I don't think it weighed on anyone that isn't familiar with the anime. If this was my first time watching I would hate this movie because it would seem shallow.

Shinobi had good actions, Okay characters (that never developed),and a someone interesting plot... but it all felt like it needed more TLC to be perfected. A lot could have been done with this movie and honestly I think they could have done much much much better than they did. It's not a bad movie, it's not horrible, it's just a decent movie.

That pretty much sums it up. It essentially focuses on two Japanese clans with warriors who possess superpowers. Two of those ""mutants"" had fallen in love and are reluctant to fight.

The cinematography is great. There is some very interesting use of filter effects. By the way, it has very creative sound effects.

However, I felt that there was probably a bit too much fighting and not enough love story. I like action movies, but the plot basically seemed like a poor excuse to get Japanese warriors to start killing each other. There was barely any lead or background into the battle scenes - just a brief exchange between the two lovers and then off to war. During the battle scenes, I found myself often confused as to what was going on as there were so many references to ancient feuds and warriors seem to come from nowhere to start another battle.

Overall, this seems like this movie requires you to have a lot of background knowledge on Shinobi and the mythology around it to really appreciate this movie. It's too bad - if the plot had been a bit more accessible, it would have had a lot more potential.",1256774400,,1459,5.714285714285714
2648441,4,B000HXDWOG,"In the 80's I grew up hooked on the ninja fad.  I watched every cheesy ninja movie that I could find in the video store and Sho Kosugi was my idol.  That being said I still enjoy watching martial arts/ninja films now just as much as when I was a kid.  Shinobi Heart Under Blade fits right in with your typical ninja film.  Basic premise, two main ninja clans in 17th Century Japan must each pick their 5 best warriors to compete against each other in a race to appease the Emperor.  In order to appreciate this film you need to understand that the Japanese code of honor is very strict.  If that means killing your lover to appease the Emperor, so be it.  Of course at the heart of the story (no pun intended) is a typical Romeo and Juliet relationship but honestly that's not really why people watch ninja movies!  You want to see cool martial arts moves and lots of killing.  Shinobi Heart Under Blade delivers most of what you want, just not enough of it.  My thoughts;

Pros

+ Plenty of unique ninjas all with their own special skills/powers to differentiate them.

+ Story adheres to traditional Japanese beliefs in the code of honor and that the Emperor is near divine.

+ Beautiful cinematography.

+ Great fight scenes (albiet way too short).

Cons

- Nearly all of the 5 chosen ninjas from each clan die way to quickly, many having very cheap and unsatisfying deaths.  A huge loss in the story honestly.

- Absolutely no back story on any of the ninjas skills, training or upbringing.  Just slight mentions.

- Action sequences are extremely slim.  They spend way too much time focusing on the love story than they do the fight sequences, which in my opinion is what the majority of people watching this movie want to see.

- Master's of both clans must fight to the death yet there's absolutely no scene in the film of it.  Very disappointing!

While I did really enjoy the movie it could have been so much better had more content been included.  It felt more like a drama than an action movie.  Whether or not that's what the director wanted I'm not sure, but the movie loses a star because of it.  If they had simply put more action and backstory on the main characters I would have easily given the film 5 stars.  If you're into martial arts/ninja films it's definitely worth a watch.",1251936000,,2298,4.456730769230769
2648442,2,B000HXDWOG,"I purchased this film just based on the storyline, and since I'm not familiar with the novel, nor the anime, I didn't think I had to do any comparision.  However, I did compare, but not on purpose, it just turned out that way.  The Iga vs Koga intrigued me, the love story intrigued me, the Tokugawas wanting to wipe out the troublesome villages intrigued me.  I had to watch this film. While I don't regret purchasing the film, I must say that I was diappointed in it as I watched.

What did I compare it to?  The first Kage No Gundan which starred Sonny Chiba as a Hattori Hanzo.  Although that was an episodic television show, that too was primarily Iga vs Koga, it too had a tragic love story between the leader of the Iga and one of the leaders of the Koga and it too, complained that the Shogunate liked to play off the Iga and Koga against each other. Perhaps Kage No Gundan I gives a better essence of the novel, Kouga Ninja Scrolls because this movie just didn't do it for me.

In this story, Tokugawa Ieyasu summons the leaders of two rival ninja villages, one Iga, and one Koga, which happen to be neighbors, and observes a demonstration of each village's talents.  he sets up a tournament in which 5 of the best fighters of each village fight each other.  Two of the participants  are the heirs to the two villages, who happen to be in love with each other. There is an ulterior motive to all this, and without giving away the rest of the plot, let's just say that Tokugawa finds ninjas to be a danger to his rule.

The tournament is that the village of the one survivor who makes it to the castle will win and the Ieyasu's heir will be determined.  Thus, on their way to the castle, the individuals fight each other.  This is the bulk of the action for the film.  The special effects are the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon variety, but not as elaborate, and not as good.  Because it relies on special effects, and the characters, we are told, have extraordinary abilities - somewhat like the mutants in the universe of Marvel Comics, the martial arts is also lacking - especially when compared to Kage No Gundan.

Lots of stuff reminds me of Kage No Gundan I.  First the plot as stated in the second paragraph of this review.  Second, Koga ninja Gennosuke, played by Joe Odagiri, reminds me of Hattori Hanzo, except that Odagiri plays the Koga heir as a subtle strong silent type.  Third, some of the dialogue.  Although different characters in the movie say these lines, I could swear that some of the dialogue is exactly what the Hattori Hanzo character would say Kage No Gundan I.  But do I think the movie was paying tribute to it?  No, I don't think so - I think it was just trying to adapt the story it was based on. Needless to say, however, I liked the dialogue, but I think Sony Chiba delivered those lines better.

So, what I liked was the plot, the dialogue, and also impressed with Joe Odagiri's intrepretation of Koga Gennosuke.  I was not too impressed with the fight scenes.  And I was really disppointed in the execution of the storyline.  I wish they could have developed the characters more fully, so I could relate to them better. And while it is fine for fans of shinobi, for the less knowledgeable, there should have been a better explanation of why Tokugawa viewed ninjas as a threat.  I also think the movie should have given Hattori Hanzo a bigger role somehow leading to some intrigue, given he was an Iga himself.

Bottom line is that it's an all right movie.  If you are a big fan of shinobi plots, or you are a big fan of any of the actors, you should see it for the sake of seeing it, otherwise, it's okay to pass this one up - there are better choices for ninja films and there are better choices for the Romeo and Juliet type of tragic love story.",1247356800,6,3791,4.3757142857142854

*Excellent action, special effects, and fight scenes.  Very fantastic and imaginative.
*Excellent photography and cinematography.  Good production design (customes, make-up, props).
*Good story.  Has some drama and a big love story, but is not overly melodramatic.  If you've seen ""Basilisk,"" this is basically the same plot.
*A great cast of imaginative and well-acted characters (was also pleseantly surprised to see the ""Ninja Scroll""'s Kangero in there!).

The Bad Things
*Ummm....

Definately one of my top favorite ninja/samurai movies of all time! I was expecting a long drawn-out melodrama, but was pleseantly surprised with the film's action scenes and photography.  Highly reccomended to anybody looking for a good Asian fantasy epic.

The story line as a whole was a little iffy, but I suppose it's tough to make a believable ninjas with superpowers movie. The fight scenes were well choreographed, and I do like how they weren't afraid to kill off some characters unlike many American films.",1215216000,,590,4.5233644859813085
2648483,2,B000HXDWOG,"I got this because it was one of the cheaper blu-rays that I hadn't seen and might care to see.  Not a great choice as it turns out.  Shinobi is pretty dull.

Camera : many quasi-still shots showing the characters' faces to best effect.  Forlorn and wistful being their usual facial expression.  Their destiny (big capital letters implied) is calling, cue ponderous music.  The male lead looks especially haunted (but with an amazingly trendy Japanese haircut).  The female lead is pretty and... haunted.  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, the haunted look concludes Shinobi's character development section.  Visuals similar to House of Flying Daggers, but not as beautiful or subtle.

Plot?  Meh.  Others have already reviewed it and there is little more to be told.  It doesn't help that the viewers are let in on the Shogun's big secret desire to wipe out the Shinobis at the beginning.  OK, martial arts movies aren't necessarily the place to look for great plots.  But Shinobi is lamer than many, despite (because of?) its melodramatic Romeo & Juliet pretensions.

Action?  Well, the director is not Ang Lee, that's for sure (and yes, I know Ang Lee didn't do martial arts before you know what).  There are some good special effects, but again little in the way of camera dynamics.  The fights manage to be stylish and boring.  No Ong Bak, Shaolin, Jackie Chan or Jet Li here.  Not Fight Club either.  Those other films get their actors sweaty with in-your-face action, but almost everything here is resolved by various super-powers of dubious interest and cheap CGI wizardry.  Nobody breaks a sweat or musses up their hair.

So, if you have an action movie with uninteresting action, nice-ish pix, and a warmed over plot, what's left?  A nice showcase for blu-ray technology at cut prices.

Many positive reviewers seem to be anime fans.  I am not.  I like animation movies in general, but dislike most Japanese anime besides Miyazaki and a few others.  Which means my review is probably irrelevant to you if you love anime.",1214265600,2,2027,4.86217008797654

2648495,4,B000HXDWOG,"Take the story of Romeo and Juliet, mix in elements of The X-Men and Ninja fantasy and you get 'Shinobi - Heart Under Blade'. Two ninja clans, the Koga and the Iga are long time enemies who have formed a truce. The heirs to the leadership of both clans fall in love, but since this movie is similar to Romeo and Juliet you can guess that a tragic fate awaits them. The shogun, who sees both clans as a threat devises a plot to get rid of them by pitting both clans against each other. What follows is a rather enchanting story that is marred by the occasional shoddy CGI effects and some truly questionable acting.

Don't get me wrong, 'Shinobi' is a great film with some truly awesome cinematography and some great action scenes; it truly feels like a live action Anime. Sadly though, dialogue delivery feels rather forced at times, and rarely authentic and some of the charaters in the film exhibit rather cheesy qualities. Couple that with the most predictable of story lines and you get a decent film that could have been something amazing. The majority of the characters seem almost like cardboard cut outs; the script makes no motions to flesh out their back stories or motivations. Though the intentions of both clans are never really explored, the clans are polarized with one seemingly 'good' and the other seemingly 'evil', though it is never really told why this is. I could totally be missing the mark, but these were my observations.

It may sound like I didn't enjoy the film, but as you can see by the star rating I gave I did enjoy it a lot. Despite all its flaws 'Shinobi' is an entertaining film with some stunning visuals. One of the things that hurts this film the most is that it tries to be both a romance and an action film, and sadly the romance portion gets somewhat lost in the fray. The romance between the two clan heirs is never fully developed and hardly gets any screen time. The battle scenes are pretty clever and entertaining. All of the characters have some form of special power, and there are duels aplenty to enjoy.

This Blu Ray features a pretty gorgeous picture, albeit some spikes in grain and the occasional soft, two-dimensional looking frame. 'Shinobi' doesn't have that 'pop' that is found in the best of HD titles, but it won't disappoint and is certainly a step up from the Standard DVD version. Colors can be vivid (especially in the forest scenes), however it is very inconsistent. Black levels are pretty bad as well, with crush overcoming most of the night scenes along with a drop in contrast. The special effects suffer greatly under the HD spotlight; there were numerous effects that looked too fake (I'm guessing this is due to the enhanced clarity of the picture).

The audio quality is pretty impressive, offering up the most minute of audio details in stunning clarity. The battle scenes especially benefit from this; 'Shinobi' takes on a very Anime-like soundtrack that truly compliments the film.

This Blu Ray edition ports over all of the standard DVD special features, making of featurettes etc. I was somewhat disappointed that FUNimation didn't transfer the features into HD, but this seems to be a common trend for Blu Ray titles.

Overall I was pretty impressed with this film, despite the few arguments I presented earlier. While 'Shinobi' isn't the best of Asian dramas, its certainly a great ninja flick with many Anime like qualities.

The movie is supposed to revolve around the battle between the Iga and the Kouga, but it's also supposed to be mainly around the two lovers Oboro and Gennosuke. You barely see them together, and more time is spent on  very brief but visually stunning battle sequences between the Iga and Kouga Ninjas. Isn't the point of a tragic romance to actually SHOW the romance a bit more? There's also lack of character development too, but considering how long you see some of them on the screen, it probably wasn't worth the director's time anyway. It's almost like the director chose the characters he wanted to showcase and threw the rest under a rug. Visually, this movie is stunning! The locations for Manjidani and Tsubagakure are completely different but very beautiful and show how much both ninja villages vary. Manjidani is a mountainous area that is more arid, whilst Tsubagakure is near a river and is surrounded by greenery. The special effects are AMAZING and you can tell that a majority of the director's budget was spent here instead of making more of a story. Overall, it's worth it to see this movie at least once.

2648517,2,B000HXDWOG,"I waited for months to see Shinobi, which looked like an entertaining movie. Wasn't I surprised after I watched the film and realized how much it sucked. It's basically an action/romance film that fails miserably at establishing both action and romance.

The romantic relationship was poorly developed. I was willing to look past this if the characters actually made decisions that were consistent with their undying devotion to one another. They don't. When our married couple are assigned to fight to the death (in a 5-on-5 fight), the husband temporarily disengages combat to investigate the reasons behind this royal command. What does the wife do? Promptly RE-ENGAGES COMBAT by ambushing the husband's 5-man team! How romantic. At that point I just wanted her to die a horrible death for betraying the very concept of love. You wench!

By far the most disappointing aspect of Shinobi are the action sequences. I was expecting something akin to the post-2000 Chinese wuxia films or perhaps Azumi, not the crappy CGI-filled garbage that made The Promise, Storm Riders, and A Man Called Hero a total waste of time. Shinobi uses CGI tomfoolery in an effort to take the lazy way out, thus bypassing the need to map out innovative and exciting fighting moves. Not good.

It is important to note that all 10 of our characters are supposedly superhuman, so they should have some cool moves. They don't. In fact, their special abilities are beyond idiotic. One girl can stare people to death. Wow. How many great action scenes are possible with that talent? Um, let's see . . . oh yeah - NONE! Another girl kills by showing off her sexy legs and kissing guys to death. Another girl simply acts the human shield by jumping in front of the lead female protagonist on numerous occasions. One of the guys can take the face of a dead person. Whoever thought of these ""special abilities"" obviously had no foresight into the destructive ramifications that would befall the action scenes, almost ALL of which end in ONE simple move - i.e., a kiss, a stare, a single swing of a sword, etc. Basically, a character will be strolling along in the lush woodlands of Japan, then you'll hear a slicing sound, then the character falls over. In the entire 100-minute running time, the only halfway decent action scene is the slow-mo multiple ninja fight with the lead protagonist, which lasts less than 2 minutes.

In addition, not all action scenes need to be long and complexly choreographed. If there is sufficient storyline and character development, a short - yet intense - fight can be very effective (see Kill Zone). However, badly choreographed action in context with bad or non-existent storyline or character development is a poor combination. Shinobi indulges in this bitter recipe far too often.

Here's an example of the fighting ineptitude present in Shinobi. The grand finale has our two lovebirds fight to the death. The entire scene consists of the following: the wife runs at the husband and stabs him in the chest. That's it! And considering the utter lack of character development, I was ready to throw my computer out my front window after witnessing that debacle.

Even more upsetting than the crappiness of this film are the comments on IMDb. One positive reviewer went so far as to say that Shinobi is ""far superior to Azumi and Azumi 2 in all aspects."" This person should be forced to lick the pond scum off of the underbelly of a garbage boat for the rest of their natural life. The statement is basically analogous to someone saying that a McDonald's hamburger is ""far superior"" to a filet mignon. Only a certifiable lunatic could possibly hold that opinion.

Take an example. Shinobi and (the much maligned) Azumi 2 have a similar character who wears furry camouflage and has blades for weapons. The difference is that Azumi 2 contributes an excellent fight in a bamboo forest while also incorporating poison-laced razor-sharp wires. Shinobi kills the character with - yet again - a deadly kiss. I know that opinion is subjective, but anyone who seriously claims that Shinobi's use of that character was better than that of Azumi 2 should be committed to a mental health facility.

By now the viewer should have noted how much I despise the utter piece of crap-infested garbage that calls itself Shinobi. It's essentially equivalent to The Promise, only with Japanese actors and less CGI. The only thing that saves this film from a 1/10 is the cinematography and acting. And if anyone else has the utter lack of taste to claim that Shinobi is better than Azumi, I will personally hire that cute little assassin to slice you apart.

2648520,4,B000HXDWOG,"""Shinobi"" is Japan's attempt to make a big martial arts fantasy epic, obviously inspired by the success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and the revived interest overseas in Chinese wuxia flicks.  The problem is, martial arts fantasy isn't really Japan's forte.  Japanese period films tend to focus more on the duty/passion conflict inherent in the samurai, whose sword-skills are precise rather than flashy.  A single-cut kill is the apex of the art of the samurai, not flying around on trees and flinging millions of little knives all at once.

As source material, the 1959 novel ""The Koga Ninja Scrolls"", previously adapted as the anime series ""Basilisk"", was a good base, using the traditional conflict between the Iga and Koga ninja villages with a Romeo/Juliet love story thrown in for good measure.  (The director is sure to hammer this point home, even stating several times that the two are ""star-crossed lovers""). Director Ten Shimoyama was also a good choice, having experience in the Chinese action film industry, and was able to supply some of the dramatic action that is a hallmark of that genre.  The lead actress Yukie Nakama brought some star power, being probably the most popular actress in Japan today.  They were even good enough to skirt around her inability to fight, as Yukie has all the martial arts ability of a broom stick.  But she does have an awfully pretty face, which was used to full effect.

All in all, ""Shinobi"" is a good flick, better than I had expected.  There is not really the experience there, either on the part of the actors or the director, to produce a really moving martial arts fantasy, but everyone worked with what they had, keeping the action low-key and making the emotions of the characters the focus.  Because the basis of the story is the Romeo/Juliet conflict, nobody is really expecting a happy ending, but even with that in mind the character's deaths have impact, and even then not everything turns out exactly as expected.  Some of the choices were odd, and I am not really sure what is the point of including legendary warriors Hattori Hanzo and Jubei Yagyu in the plot without sending them into battle, and they serve as little more than recognizable set decoration.",1200009600,21,2231,4.873015873015873

2648522,5,B000HXDWOG,"'Shinobi' is one of the most memorable Japanese films in recent times, and has strong recall due to the story, the characters, and the effects. This is a technical masterpiece--the special effects, though a bit noticeable at times, do not distract from the cinematography and instead compliments it. The story does not drag, rather, it immerses you slowly into the fleeting world of the ninja. The actors, led by Joe Odagiri and Yukie Nakama, give convincing and powerful performances.

However, most critics are disappointed with this movie based on several points:

- The story was dragging, short, and too emotional: While it is true that there were some unreasonably long scenes, one has to remember that this is an Asian film, and Asians have a tendency to focus more on the drama and emotions. Westerners who have little exposure to Asian films (aside from the hardcore action 'Kung-Fu' types) will surely have a hard time understanding this. And please note the title: ""Heart Under Blade."" This was a romantic film, and heavy with Asian values.

- The action and fight scenes were too short and characters killed early in the story: ""Shinobi"" is actually a movie version of ""Basilisk"", a popular manga about the last remaining ninja tribes during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Thus, most of the Japanese audience were already acquainted with most of the characters. Also, take note of the Japanese emphasis on the brevity and transitory nature of life, which is the point of the tale and the period wherein the age of the ninja was at its twilight.

- This is not an action film: True. The focus of this tale is not the war between the Iga and the Koga tribes (it instead emphasizes the pointlessness of the conflict), but the tragedy of fateful love.

This is first and foremost a Japanese film, and being a Japanese film it reflects Asian values which you should always bear in mind when watching Asian action films. And as with most great Asian films, there is always that underlying theme of sacrifice. Once you can appreciate this movie on these terms, only then will you understand why ""Shinobi"" is a masterpiece.",1193788800,3,2120,4.845303867403315
2648523,5,B000HXDWOG,"I put this movie on my wish list a while ago and to be honest I didn't know anything about it and forgot about it after some time. I was sitting at home looking for stuff to watch on one really boring night and out of nowhere I see Shinobi on my now favorite TV station the AZN Network. Shinobi is a very simple but strong film and the time will fly by watching it. If you don't know Shinobi is adapted from the book ""The Kouga Ninja Scrolls"" like the anime Basilisk and both use a lot of the same character names. A Shinobi is a ninja with inhuman powers that put them on a entirely different level than normal ninja. The movie is set long ago when two ninja clans had to fight each other in a last man standing battle. The Iga clan and the Koga clan both produce powerful Ninja.

5 Shinobi are picked from both clans and the 5 will fight until one is left standing. The true problem is that this film is more of a Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story. The two leaders of the clan are secretly in love and have been keeping this secret for a while. Now that they must go to war with each other the two try and forget about their love and fight like they were trained to do. There is a lot of risks in Shinobi that could destroy the film if done wrong or cheap. The fight sequences are out of this world and very well done. The film uses crazy special effects to increase the power of the shinobi and also show their godly talents. To explain best it is definitely something you would expect only animation could create or a video game. I know that might sound a little impossible but somehow this director and his crew made it look very realistic and exciting. There is little martial arts if any so don't expect that.

The acting was good but it's not totally what stood out so it wasn't strong enough to mention. The story itself is simple like I said but still the culture and history make it more interesting. The settings and cinematography were amazing, very clean, and colorful. I only wish that I could've seen this on the big screen. All of the characters were cool and original with great weird personalities. Overall I could understand that some people might take away from this movie seeing the weird cinematography as a fault, the acting or even the simple story. I understand that but I thought this movie was fine and if anything the fights could have had more stylish choreography.

Still, another guy looked like a giant pea pod with a face and the lead guy had some silly punk rock hair-do and looked like he would be more comfortable in a skin tight, pink patten leather, sparkle covered suit.  There was NO real martial arts technique in the movie and the actors did not come across very strong... except this one guy who threw darts...  He, in my opinion, was the best actor in the whole movie.... other than his good acting, I think the movie was just boring and sad....  Hey!, if you want to see a bad Japanese rip off of X-Men, then this is your film, but if you are looking for a movie with good action or a movie about Shinobi, this is just not it, as far as I am concerned.",1187740800,5,1425,4.186813186813187
2648536,4,B000HXDWOG,"This is a good movie. yes there are all the lame angles that we've seen in films a million times, like the star-crossed lovers and stuff like that, but the abilities of the fighters were shown pretty good, and there were some really amazing scenes. The female star's ""terror gaze"" or whatever it was called was something to behold. It started quickly and ended quickly but it was a fun action filled ride. Poison spitting, face stealing, head slicing fun! You should definitely pick it up!",1183680000,2,489,4.6976744186046515

2648538,5,B000HXDWOG,I really loved this movie. If you like ninja movies this is one of the best. It gives a little history of Japan so if you know about history you know how it ends but getting to the end is all the fun with the shinobi many skills.

2648539,2,B000HXDWOG,"Having seen the posters for this movie near the Castle in Iga-Ueno, Mie Prefecture (one of the two actual home towns of Japanese Ninjitsu), I had unrealistically high hopes for it.  This flick has nothing to do with real ninjitsu.  It's an attempt to cross an Asian Epic/Love Story in the spirit of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".. with ""video game"" ninjas who possess ridiculous magical powers and colorful costumes.  I suppose it might have been a better movie if it had just been one or the other.  Pity, because the lead actors (Odagiri Jo and Nakama Yukie) are pretty good and deserved a better movie.  History buffs might note that some of the politics hinted-at in Sunpu Castle are pretty accurate.  The CGI version of Sunpu-Jo was pretty interesting in itself, but hardly worth the price of a DVD.",1180483200,2,807,4.76978417266187

I have become a fan of Japanese cinema for the heart, soul, and passion that goes into making these movies.  Once again, Tak Sakaguchi steals the show, even in his limited screen appearances.  Joe Odagiri is great as well.  The plot moves at a decent pace while development of each character falls into place with each new scene.

Action packed with a great music soundtrack and well placed cinematography that gives the viewer an oppurtunity to feel exactly what the characters are feeling.  Watch this movie before yuou judge it...give it a chance to bring you intothat world, and understand it.",1178668800,6,756,4.7251908396946565
2648543,2,B000HXDWOG,"I realize the content of a book usually doesn't transfer well to a motion picture, but this movie kinda went overboard.

Now, I must admit, I never actually read the original novel, but I did see the anime series (aka Basilisk); which, from what I have heard, followed closely to the book (or close enough). Unfortunately, the movie decided to pull a Spielberg.

Why is that important you ask? That's because the original work had great concepts, and this film just wasted them. I thought I was watching a cheesy version of Mortal Kombat (and I thought Mortal Kombat was a bit on the corny side to begin with). All the great characters who I enjoyed watching from the anime were twisted into plain and boring meatbags that gushes blood. I thought a live-action film would be more mature than a cartoon; boy, was I wrong.

So, yeah, this movie pretty much sucked. It's filled with mediocre acting, cheesy special effects, bad makeup, horrific costumes (I thought it was suppose to be Feudal Japan, not the land of make-believe), and worst of all, the murdering of a great concept.

Folks, go buy the anime series instead. Yeah, that might not be everybody's cup of tea, but still better than wasting your time watching this one.",1178582400,3,1227,4.693023255813953

2648557,4,B000HXDWOG,"In the same spirit of Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon, Shinobi goes very deep into cultural roots with a heavy dose of ""Anim"" like action to create a compelling love story rich with visual fanfare.

Though the romantic plot is not as powerful as Crouching Tiger or House of Flying Daggers, it is still a compelling story for which you will want to know how it ends.  But frankly, the real meat and potatoes of this movie is about the combat and the very Anim inspired characters. There are other live action anims out there, but this has quickly taken it's place to my number one favorite amongst them.  Bonus points for making this accessible to the open non-initiated public.  Naruto fans should find the same kind of interesting character concepts, save for the fact that everything is taken with a very mature tone (no teen aged ninjas here).  Anyone who liked Warriors of Zu Mountain or Storm Riders will definitely want to pick this up.",1174089600,17,944,4.662650602409639

2648559,4,B000HXDWOG,"Since I am drawn to the subject of ninjas in general, I had to check out this film no matter what. While I do not regret purchasing this DVD, for it's certainly well-produced and visually pleasing.  I can't help but think that this story would've been served best by using a mini-series format that could've fleshed out the characters more thoroughly and further develop the drama and details of this saga (as hinted by the characters' histories in the Official Movie website).  It was certainly a pleasant experience albeit without any real plot twists or surprises.",1173312000,12,567,4.895833333333333
2648560,3,B000HXDWOG,"`Shinobi' means in Japanese `'concealment' or `clandestine' and the word is often used as an archaic and slightly elegant way of referring to `ninja.' This Japanese film ""SHINOBI"" released in 2005 is exactly what the title says - lots of battles between the feuding ninja clans and the romance of the star-crossed lovers.

The story is set in the early 17th century in Japan, when the Tokugawa dynasty (or the Shogun) has taken the control of the whole nation of Japan, and the peace is about to be realized. That means, however, a precarious position for two rival ninja clans - Koga and Iga - both people who are raised to be deadly assassins. In short, they have no place to live in this peaceful era to come.

Tokugawa decrees that each of these clans pick up five of their best ninjas, and have them fight. Among the ten fighters are Iga's beautiful woman Oboro (Yukie Nakama) and Koga's handsome Gennosuke (Jo Odagiri), both secretly in love with one another.

The film is based on the novel `Koga Ninpouchou' (serialized 1958-59) written by Japanese writer Futarou Yamada (1922-2001). The film gives emphasis to Romeo and Juliet-like element of the original which was changed considerably for the film. The novel is also turned into comic ""Basilisk,"" which was later made into animation (don't forget checking out the DVDs).

The film ""SHINOBI"" is shot with stylish battle scenes and beautiful cinematography. The actions lack the graceful movements of characters in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but the fights themselves are competently done, and most (if not all) ninja skills are unique and interesting. Actors are mostly great, especially the two leads. Yukie Nakama is hugely popular and recognized as one of the talented actors in Japan, and so is Jo Odagiri. If you see them, you will see the reasons instantly.

Still I must give only three stars because of the two reasons. One is the script of which weakness gets obvious in the middle part. The motives of some characters such as Gennnosuke going to the Shogun's castle are not clear. Actually many Japanese viewers complained of the weak storyline that fails to convince us why they should fight each other in the first place. Reasons are explained, but not strong and sufficient enough. [In 2005 the film was awarded worst film by Bunshun Magazine's Kiichogo Award that started in 2004. I for one don't think it deserves this Japanese Razzie Award (kiichigo means raspberry), but it is certain many of us are disappointed.]

My great disappointment is the battle scenes themselves. Surely they are done with styles, but they show neither the life-or-death thrills of fighting nor the extraordinary ninjutu (skills of ninja) that made the original book famous and popular. You see only a glimpse of what these ninjas can do, or the complicated relations between them, which makes the world of the original more colorful than the filmed version. The film is good, and some parts are truly moving, but there are more to the original and its hugely amazing ninja world.",1173052800,8,3040,4.916179337231969
2648561,2,B000HXDWOG,"This movie is terribly boring. I fell asleep twice during it. The fight scenes are too short. The CG used in the film is very cheap looking. The ""drama"" will cause you to roll your eyes. It's a B-movie that thinks it's a masterpiece...

Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it.
