8164619,3,6303515274,Pretty good for a third installment. Superior to Relentless 2 in that it avoided the espionage subplot. The killer is far more psychotic than Judd Nelson's character in the first one. Still fairly predictable but worth seeing once.,1462838400,,231,5.105263157894737
8164620,4,6303515274,"This is a rough film, make no mistake, but it's very interesting all the way and he best of the ""Relentless"" movies.  It has many of the same elements the two other films had: some grisly scenes, rough language but a fast-moving film which really goes fast considering it's only 80-some minutes long.

Leo Rossi once again stars but I liked his partner (Robert Costanzo) much better. William Forsythe once again plays a creepy killer. He seems to be typecast. The female lead is someone I haven't seen before or since: attractive Signy Coleman.

I did get confused a couple of issues such as how the detectives figured a few things out and that end. Also, whatever happened to ""Marianne?"" They do discuss something briefly but I couldn't get it. I don't claim this film is a great work of art: just entertaining.

Without giving anything I will say I liked the ending which wasn't the usual clichd one. This is the only one in the series I would consider re-purchasing for DVD.",1239667200,2,977,4.630057803468208
8164621,4,6303515274,"Leo Rossi is back as Detective Sam Dietz in his third installment of Relentless.  After really liking Relentless one and two I was ready to be disappointed. You know, at some point they have got to bomb.  But this is not the one.  This could be the best of the series.  The reason why?  In a nut shell-William Forysthe. He is simply great in this movie.  The story is about a savage serial killer who is slaughtering young women and taunting police by mailing them momentos of his handiwork.  For Sam Dietz this one gets close and personal.  I recommend Relentless 1, 2 & 3 but stay away from 4, it's horrible.",1014076800,4,610,4.383928571428571
