8002293,4,B0000JCFM2,"As a long time fan of Carl Weathers since his Apollo Creed days, I enjoyed Dangerous Passion very much. It makes a good companion piece to Action Jackson but contains more human drama. Carl looks as good as always with decent acting skills to
accompany his impressive physique. Billy Dee Williams makes a particularly malevolent villian but I found Lonette McKee's character vaguely annoying at times.

The story moves along at a brisk pace and the action scenes are well executed. Despite some partial nudity, Dangerous Passion does have a TV movie feel (but not suitable for kids) particularly with regard to the bad guy's final comeuppance! Overall, if you are a Carl Weathers fan and enjoy his other movies, I recommend Dangerous Passion to you.

Now will some studio please release Hurricane Smith and Fortune Dane onto DVD!",1339372800,4,829,4.956834532374101
8002294,4,B0000JCFM2,"Some years ago I bought a video cassette of this movie and I never forgot it - I think mainly because of Lonette McKee's interesting performance. The story line comes right out of the film noir tradition. Carl Weathers plays a character which would have been a typical part for Robert Mitchum some 45 years earlier: a confused and badly treated employee of a rich immoral guy with a beautiful wife. I see elements here of movies like Out of the Past, The Chase or Where Danger Lives. And Weathers really delivers. He is rather shy and reticent and seems to present what bad stuff is going to happen - but hasn't got the power to do anything against it. Contrary to Mitchum in similar parts he does not show a cool detachment but comes through as a feeling human being. He ""elopes"" with his boss's wife and the stations of their desparate flight are very well filmed. In the end there is a car chase and a  revenge binge. They don't really fit into the story and are the only reason why I don't want to give Danerous Passion five stars.
A last word about Lonette McKee. She shows a first rate performance in this movie as the abused wife. Disoriented, warm, sexy but most of the time a pain in the a... Her acting at times reminded me of Barbara Stanwyck.
I really like these movies which do not let you expect too much and then reveal themselves to be interesting stuff and pleasant to watch.",1271116800,8,1392,4.395348837209302
