2163244,4,B00062IVNU,"My husband loves to watch the old series when it is replayed on TV, however, it isn't often replayed. For his birthday I bought this dvd set. It arrived ahead of schedule and in good condition. The video quality is very good, some of the demonstrations are ahead of their time and the sound quality is good. The only trouble I had was finding a dvd player that would let me choose a chapter. I'm not sure if it is my machine or the discs. Either way I will not return the set because he is able to watch it. I would recommend this set. It has a timelessness about it that makes us want to watch it again and again.",1313971200,,614,4.082644628099174
2163245,5,B00062IVNU,"I had watched the series on TV many years past and thought it helped me, as a new golfer at the time.  Now that I've improved over the years the lessons mean even more and the imitation of Jones' swing added 15 yards to my drives.  It would be nice to compile the ""real"" golf lessons without having to watch the miscellaneous stuff going on...interesting once or twice but real help is in watching Jones swing.

8037612,5,B00062IVNU,"I purchased this for my husband, an avid golfer.  He's watched these over and over and is applying Bobby Jones' techniques and he says that they're working for him.  Though Bobby Jones' teachings and techniques are from decades ago, they're basic and tested by one of the greatest golfers ever lived!  For those who do not know Bobby Jones, he would not turn pro as he wanted to maintain the integrity of the game and felt that money will destroy the gentlemen's game AND he designed Augusta GA where the Master's is played.  I recommend this to all golfers!",1368144000,,558,4.606060606060606
