8516976,2,B007I1Q562,"In contrast to the previous reviewer, I'd say this IS a lot of psycho-babble...reducing hatred to bio-psychological factors while ignoring broader social and political forces.  Especially disappointing was the film's reinforcement of the dominant narrative re: the conflict in Palestine:  Palestinians are depicted as the terrorists and Israeli Jews as merely the victims of terror.  On the DVD cover it even refers to Palestinians as ""militants"" and Israelis as ""settlers.""  I am SO tired of this simplistic and anti-Palestinian rendering of the conflict.  The history and broader context of the conflict is ignored. Hatred is an important topic, to be sure, but I wouldn't recommend this film as a vehicle for understanding it.",1354924800,2,729,5.415929203539823
8516977,5,B007I1Q562,"My initial reaction to (admittedly half-hearted) viewing this documentary was that it was mostly platitudes and psycho-babble about how hate is bad, and empathy is good.  But a few moments reflection had me thinking about the various points the movie made, causing me to unintentionally dwell more and more on the overall issues presented.  So, it would seem that the presentation was much more successful in stimulating thought than I had initially perceived.

During the first third, the producers surveyed a few individuals who were caught up in hate - some neo-nazis, anti-homosexuals, a few Israelis and Palestinians, and some U.S. soldiers.  Their statements provoked anger in me, and I wanted to hurt some of them.  But that was one of the points the movie made.  Hatred often stems from fear and anger.

Some psychologist (sociologist or anthropologist) interviewed, made the point that we all have a ""shadow"" side to us.  But rather than recognize the evil potential within each of us, we project it outward, onto others, creating a convenient enemy whom we can attack in a delusional effort to exorcise the wickedness that we ourselves harbor.

Perhaps most frightening, though not explicitly addressed in the movie, our ability to hate and be blind to our own evil, can be manipulated by others - usually political or religious groups.  And the fact that otherwise good, decent people can be corrupted and controlled by cynical powers is both disturbing and depressing.

The movie aims to give hope that we humans, as a species, can recover from our evolved capacity to bring harm to one another for the specious of reasons.  But I've always believed the old maxim, ""If you would have peace, strive for justice.""  And it is this lack of focus on justice that gives me pause in rating a fifth star for this movie.  Still, the movie did so notable instances in which the haters came to an awakened sense of humanity and moral responsibility.  In the end, a number came to regret their actions under hatred's thrall.",1350000000,2,2024,4.911764705882353
