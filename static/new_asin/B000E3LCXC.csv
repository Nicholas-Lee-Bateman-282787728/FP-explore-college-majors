2486898,3,B000E3LCXC,"I've been watching many docs on impressionists lately.  Because Monet was probably the most famous of the group, every other doc refers to him.  So this presented things I already knew.  But if you like to learn about the most famous and then move to the obscure, you may want to see this first.

It turns out his first name was Oscar, not Claude.  Like Kahlo, Rembrandt, and many other artists, he had severe financial concerns.

If you love impressionism, then you'll feel good seeing so much of his work.  The narrator had horrid French pronunciation.  That annoying expert with the squeaky, mousy voice is here again.  Hopefully she won't grate on your nerves.",1197936000,14,664,4.754385964912281

8105375,5,B000E3LCXC,Love Claude Monet!! Just got back from Portland and was delighted to visit the art musuem with my son and was surprised to see not one but two Monet's waterlillies.,1465344000,,164,4.5
8105376,4,B000E3LCXC,"I watched this before making a trip to Paris to see a lot of his work, and found it to have a very good summary of his life and the history of his artistic endeavors, which gave me a greater appreciation for the art I was able to see in person.  He is one of those few artists that make me want to take up painting again.  He is one of those genius painters that I think no computer will never be able to match for his interpretation of the world he saw.  Such masterful use of color, light, and composition; all with the ease of a master painter, great art made to look effortless.",1459209600,,582,4.043478260869565

8105381,5,B000E3LCXC,"Monet, what more need to be said.  An excellent documentary detailing the life of the Father of Impressionism, and one of my own personal muses.  He was one of the reasons that I began painting when I was very young and one of my great influences.

What Monet did with a brush was what God does with Mother Nature, put a face of beauty on a sow's ear; or lipstick on a pig, if you prefer.  Light was never revealed like this; nor as revered (funny how one depiction of the use of the word ""revered"" should involve a reference to one of Monet's contemporaries and a member of the movement he helped create - Czanne).",1426723200,,615,4.275862068965517
