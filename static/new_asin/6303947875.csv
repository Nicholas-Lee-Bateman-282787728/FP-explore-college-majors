I have the video and tend to watch Parker Posey's hilarious portrayal of Mary, a girl who had a  father without a conscience, and a mother with no common sense, over and over again. The  lingo in the movie is so funny that I find myself reciting many phrases. I  have followed Parker Posey's career since the soap opera ""As The World  Turns"", when she played Tess, and she is a remarkable actress. I loved  this hip comedy. It's a must see.",919555200,,471,4.247191011235955

Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings and quoting dialogue. That fits the bill for me. I still have this film on video cassette. For years and years and years I searched the Internet waiting for it to be available on DVD. This film is a treasure.

When she gets evicted she has to get a real job. She ends up at the N.Y. Public Library and loves it. Her stepmother helps her along and she ends up going to library school. It has a happy ending.

The picture quality is TERRIBLE.  It's honestly as though I were watching my old VHS copy of the movie, which I still own.  If I'd wanted to do that I wouldn't have spent $11 on a USED copy of a DVD!

The soundtrack was amazing (a mix of hip-hop, and 90's house music), the dialog was memorable and funny, and Mary's style was just all-together fashionable. Although this film isn't for everyone, I think it could be enjoyed by indie film lovers, people who love 90's house music, people who love 90's club culture (or rave culture), or even librarians!",1381536000,,483,4.761904761904762

She's a big city slacker living in a loft where various hipsters and druggies drop by unannounced.  Being arrested and jailed for serving alcohol without a license inspires her to look up her old godmother and become a clerk at the local library she runs.  There is also a half hearted romance with a Lebanese street vendor and a DJ friend trying to succeed at a local club.  If nothing else, it's energetic.",1361318400,2,564,4.5

However the transfer looks fuzzy and dated viewed on an HDTV, almost as bad as if someone transferred it from VHS to DVD.  If you want to see this film in digital format, and are a Parker Posey fan, you'll enjoy it.  I was just disappointed in the quality of the transfer.

I can't tell you how many times I watched this during that period of my life and how easy it is to empathize with the story as a young adult.  Completely worth watching, it's a smart and funny movie about a smart and funny girl who learns to become somewhat more responsible as she realizes that she needs to grow up because she can't spend the rest of her life in her current status quo.",1348358400,,503,4.175257731958763

737775,3,6303947875,"A classic, very watchable romantic comedy that will really speak to anyone who grew up in the early '90s.  The DVD transfer is awful, however.  It looks like it was recorded from a VHS videotape.  I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, and I remember well the terrific cinematography, unusual for a low-budget film of the time---the gray overcast drabness of Parker Posey's character's daily life in Manhattan contrasted with the bright colors of her carefree nighttime existence.  It would be great to see that again on a proper DVD.",1302134400,10,545,4.76595744680851

In Party Girl, she is exactly that - a young 'party girl' trying to find her professional direction while bouncing around in New York City's 90's party scene.  There are numerous hilarious quotes from the movie - and although not deep or moving, the story has a positive message (peppered with drinking, drugs, and lust).

737908,4,6303947875,"I watched this movie when it came out in the theater back in 1995.  I was always bad with remembering movies, but this movie definitely left a lasting impression.  Although I didn't remember everything, I remembered the storyline and remembered how funny and entertaining the movie was.  I liked it a lot.  Parker Posey is hilarious, so cute and just adorable as quirky Mary, club kid fashionista turned librarian clerk. Plus, I think I can relate... the whole 90's rave/party scene, club kids, my love of fashion, quirkiness, etc.  Even greater, my sister is a librarian, and I can almost see her as Mary.  For years, being a librarian and a pretty darn good one, many people have asked my sister if she has seen the movie.  Sadly, she had not. I decided to change that and bought two copies, one for her and one for myself.  I am glad I did!  After rewatching it, I suddenly remember why I liked it so much.  Although I have watched it now several times over and over, the movie doesn't seem to get old; I am very glad I now have it as part of my movie collection.  Memorable scenes include:

- The club scene with Leo... the ""pop""-py, jerky club kid movements and the ""He-He-Hello""s
- Leo talking with Renee about his experience deejaying at the London clubs and his imitation of a cat choking.
- Mary dancing to Arabic music as she daydreams of her ""Lebanese Delight.""
- Flashbacks about the Dewey Decimal System, a trained monkey, and a reprimanding godmother.
- Mary's series of repeated visits as she wins back the same Lebanese Delight.
- The police stripper at Mary's surprise birthday party and her godmother's reactions just as Mary proclaims that she wants to be a librarian and go to grad school for it.

etc. etc.... way too many funny scenes to mention.  I think this movie is a hit or miss... either you like it or you don't.",1208217600,,1841,4.522658610271903

737914,4,6303947875,"This film is a delightful, light hearted look at both sides of where the ""club kid"" rave scene blends with the New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo by the omnipresent Miss Bunny).  This is ""Torch Song Trilogy"" for the perky-post-teen girls.  ""That Girl"" for our disaffected, affected millenium times.
  The dialogue is fast and funny, and Parker Posey's costumer deserves - if not an academy award, at least - a stadium ""wave"" of kudos.
  Of course, this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss Posey, and she is perfectly cast.  Like a lot of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey... but it all WORKS.  She is an entertainer, and this film entertains, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it drop to the floor.
  Mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing desinger clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend.  On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care-less in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that caring is neccessary to life.
  The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the Aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two... but... hey... this is comedy.  The best performance is by the fallafel selling boyfriend.  We should all be so lucky.
  I rate this as a 4 because it isn't a great moment of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing).  But it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone!",1153094400,6,1837,4.634674922600619

However, she draws the line at giving Mary more money, and a penniless Mary finds herself agreeing to work at the same library her godmother works at.  For a while, Mary exists as a Party Girl at night and a librarian by day.  None of her friends see her as anything other than the Party Girl, and it's only after she starts working at the library that she starts to see herself as someone with a future.

Granted, this movie definitely has problems.  The romance with the falafel salesman is weak, and it's not exactly a subtle movie.  Mary and her friends can be absolutely clueless (everyone's mentioned the ""Imitate a cat puking"" bit, but I'll mention it again - I discovered that it was possible to laugh and cringe at the same time).  As someone who works in the library, however, I have to say that some of the library humor is really fabulous.  I can't count how many times I've wanted to do what Mary did and give the people who reshelve things just anywhere a piece of my mind.  All the librarians I know who've seen this movie have loved it, so, if you work at a library, I would definitely suggest seeing this.

Mary works.  Mary shoplifts from other people's closets...""Hello Chanel!""  Mary falls for her local falafel vendor.  Mary gets the guy.  Mary loses the guy.  Mary parties.  Mary learns something about herself...mostly that her shallow lifestyle will only last so long.  The dialogue is crisp and funny, the characters are well developed, and Parker Posey's performance is brilliant.  A very young and very sexy Liev Schreiber delivers the goods as well.

Ok, I have seen ""Party Girl"" more times than any other movie (we're talking hundreds of times here). It is actually on my top five list of favorite movies. This movie is definitely not for everyone. I myself, found the movie EXTREMELY entertaining and funny. This was actually the very first independent film I ever saw and it got me into the whole Indie scene way back in the day.
What's up buttercup? The rent and I'm not paying.. NA-TASH-A!
The ""imitate a cat puking"" part makes me laugh to this day! Parker Posey is very very talented ... along with the other members of the cast.
A trained monkey learned this system on PBS in a matter of hours! Re-coat it!
The character Posey plays in the movie, Mary, wants to be a librarian and make something of herself. Granted, she is also a Party Girl, so this makes for some interesting scenarios in the movie. I would give this movie 10 stars if I could. Maybe I'm just partial to it because it was the first non-mainstream/non-Hollywood UNIQUE movie I ever saw and it broadened my horizons, but, who knows, maybe you will like it too. ;)
I want to be a librarian!

738070,4,6303947875,"Parker Posey is talented and beautiful, strong, self-assured, and yet does not take herself too seriously.  She makes this movie the delight it is.  Of course, the excellent soundtrack helps.  There are plenty of funny moments.  My favorite scene is when she arranges her roommate's album collection (and he is a serious DJ!) according to the Dewey System.  He is furious, but she calms him down after explaining how she has cross-referenced Sylvester in both the 70's Disco and Diva categories.  Absurd humor is always the best.  There's plenty of colorful clothing, dancing, music, d&eacute;cor.  Why didn't this become a cult movie?",1002499200,3,635,5.1568627450980395
738071,5,6303947875,"This has got to be one of the most innovative and tongue-in-cheek independent films of all time. I didn't know anything of the film until last year, and totally got the reason why it was revered as a cult classic among those with brains and a sense of humor.
The great thing about this movie is the leading lady, Parker Posey. Anyone who doesnt crack up the moment she opens her mouth has obviously had a seriously deprived childhood. Among all contemporary actresses, theres not one that has the instinctive comic likeability and timing that Posey has. Well, maybe Lisa Kudrow, but shes busy wasting away her life on 'Friends'.
Parker plays Mary, a Party Girl to reckon with ('I'm a girl who parties like a man', the film's soundtrack tells us). However, with bills to pay and the feeling of self-worth to satisfy, Mary falls at the feet of her godmother, who gives her a job at the library. While the film itself is irreverent, the wondrous job it extracts from its' leading cast is superb. Parker's Middle Eastern lover, her gay best friend, and her English DJ room-mate, all spicen up the proceedings, as Mary works her way through this thing called life, only to discover that the only thing that really matters is the ability to party the best you can.
Aside from spouting some of the most unfortgettable one-liners, Parker's sullen performance as a librarian, and her transformation into a care-a-hang nightlife girl is extremely watchable. I personally preferred her performance here to the more respected one she gave in the dark 'The House of Yes'. Its also far better and substantial than the one she gave us in 'Henry Fool'.
The film also has a stunning soundtrack. The only pity is that it is not yet available on DVD. While other Parker flicks such as 'Best in Show', 'Clockwatchers' and even 'Guffman' are all getting the DVD treatment, its high time someone woke up and put this to digital disc.
Highly recommended.",991180800,19,1931,4.732937685459941
738072,4,6303947875,"I picked this movie up on a whim at the video store and I was very pleasantly suprised. I had seen Posey in ""The House of Yes"" and didn't like the film, but liked her. The film has great music and a good back drop of the club scene between drugs, fashion-tinged clothing, and club kids. I was not familiar with Omar Townshend, but he is believable as the Lebanese falafel vendor that Posey gets involved with. This is a light, enjoyable flick and of the variety that romantic comedies should be: sweet, intelligent, and with a happy ending. Definitely worth watching!",971568000,5,567,4.568627450980392
738073,3,6303947875,"Parker Posey is in great danger of becoming the Sandy Dennis of her generation, playing the ""kooky but lovable eccentric"" yet again in this somewhat dumbed-down version of ""Last Days Of Disco"". Posey's obviously natural state of perpetual twitchiness is put to good use in the role of librarian by day, party animal by night. (Naming the character ""Mary"" is an obvious goof on ""Marian the Librarian"".)The scene where a drunken Mary breaks into the library after hours, bound and determined to master the Dewey Decimal System by dawn is quite a howl. On a sliding scale of similar New York Downtown Scene films, with ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" at the top and the dismal ""Slaves Of New York"" at the bottom, this one falls somewhere in the middle. A mostly entertaining and breezy comedy (as long as you don't think about it too hard!).",969926400,2,834,4.798611111111111

738075,4,6303947875,"I never saw this when it was first released because the title really put me off.  Since I grew tired of the club scene years ago and never embraced drug culture myself, I thought a movie about some Party Girl would bore me  to tears. But a friend did recommend I rent it and give it a chance, and  now it's among my favorite films. It gets more and more charming and funny  each time I watch. I just love the whole idea of a vapid club-kid being  shackled to a library clerk job all day and falling for a (gorgeous even if  he is a horrible actor) guy who sells falafel on a street corner.  The  supporting characters are all a lot of fun, and while there are rough spots  in terms of dialogue and plot, the actors, story and great array of music  used to score the film made it a ton of fun for me.  It's not often that  I'm pleasantly surprised by a movie, this was a rare experience, but if you  have a good sense of humor and like quirky, kooky characters you should  love this movie.  I know I did.  And I must agree with the people who  fawned over Parker Posey, she absolutely makes this film and I can't  imagine it working with any other actor as Mary. This movie has already  become something of a cult classic, as it damn well should be. Is it  Citizen Kane? No. But it's a lot of fun and well worth seeking out to rent.",962236800,5,1331,4.065637065637065

Other reviews  also make it seem like a piece of fluff, while it is certainly not a life  changing or thought provoking movie, it does operate on two levels and  eventually has Parker Posey's character operate on the deeper side of life  - however the party side is oh so fun! There's a sex scene in the library  that is soooo lovely. ""I think I'm an existentialist"". I think  that if you like  Kevin Smith movies, you would like this one.",954547200,19,718,4.5546875

Its presentation of NYC night life is totally unrealistic - or  perhaps dated.  Just some small, petty examples: when has a NYC night club  EVER been as quiet as that, where people can have actual conversations?  And why are there virtually no pedestrians near the corner of Lafayette and  Houston (where the vendors sell Falafel)?  Production value extremely  low-budget.  Only a couple of real laughs.  The librarian jokes were too  easy, like shooting fish in a barrel.  It was admittedly fun to watch her  dance around, but even that got pretty tired pretty fast.

I have to assume this is the same encoding that is on the 2003 DVD, though I can't say for sure. It's still not great, and not even close to modern DVD release quality. Also, the 2002 DVD claims to have a director commentary and ""previews and trailers"" on the back of the case, but that is absent on the disc.
