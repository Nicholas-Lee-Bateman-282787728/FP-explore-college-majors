8300496,5,B001F0WRAK,"I loved this film. In 'The Story of the weeping Camel' you will spend some time with a family of nomadic shepherds in Mongolia. This in itself makes for fascinating viewing, a world so far removed from that of modern civilisation. As a viewer you immediately warm to the family as they go about their daily lives. By the close of the film you are totally won over by them. Add to this the comings and goings between a mother camel (who has just given birth for the first time) and her white calf that she refuses to accept, and you have an enthralling one-and-a-half hours of entertainment. Statements of praise are often written on the front covers of films and more often than not they fail to live up to them. Not so 'The Story of the Weeping Camel'. On it's cover it says ""Magical and touching . . . a genuine miracle"", ""Absolutely priceless"", ""Sublime . . astonishing"" - it is all of this and more. Full credit must be given to the makers of this film for allowing it to flow at it's own gentle pace. It could have easily been contaminated by wanting 'more' and making things happen which would have removed the natural ambiance of the film. This is a wonderful antidote to the noisy, violent, gun-toting, explosive pics that we are saturated with in this day and age. Here we have something that is genuine, moving, gentle, deeply human, heartwarming and truly wonderful.. . . and the stars of the show are of course the camels and you can't help but feel love for these wonderful creatures.",1350777600,2,1497,4.487179487179487
