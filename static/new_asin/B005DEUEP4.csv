8466659,4,B005DEUEP4,"Elvira presents here two more bad films for our entertainment.  Although she isn't as witty as she was in the early days, nevertheless,  it is still entertaining and fun to watch.  The quality of these two films are very good.  And so is the sound.  The jokes needed a bit more polishing, but still funny.  The price is very good and perhaps that had something to do with finding it worth watching....ha ha.  Still, this is one collection you should have.  I don't regret having it.",1424044800,,482,4.523255813953488
8466660,5,B005DEUEP4,"Two titles that were staples of the drive-in and late night TV, perfectly paired here and given the Elvira treatment.  Two lethal ladies (not counting Elvira) are on hand to raise the dead (and probably a few eyebrows as these films play out).  Cheezy, sleasy fun.  Now we need a Dracula double feature DVD to go with it, using COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE and BILLY THE KID VS. DRACULA (made back-to-back with JESSE JAMES MEETS FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER as an instant double bill back in the day).",1412899200,,494,4.72093023255814
8466661,4,B005DEUEP4,"This is another double feature of episodes from the 2010 reboot of ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"", which featured the show's original buxom ghoul-girl hosting a barrage of public domain b-movies while dealing with her daily, run-of-the-mill problems in intermittent skits. Elvira's humor is an acquired taste, mostly do to an excessive amount of puns and other eye-rolling jokes.

Elvira's antics are the highlights of the show, but these movies aren't THAT bad... Well, one isn't anyway. The theme here is that both films are sort-of Frankenstein movies, And that's about all they have in common! ""Lady Frankenstein"" is a slightly depraved story of sex, murder and body-snatching that has just the right amount of sleaze to make it worthwhile. ""Jesse James Meets Frankestein's Daughter"" is a terrible western/sci-if mash-up that takes forever to get anywhere and never bothers to get anywhere interesting.

Although the movies are presented in murky, censored prints, the reason to get these DVDs is Elvira. If you just want to see the movies, get something else because this is far from optimal treatment for both movies.",1407456000,,1117,5.23463687150838
8466662,5,B005DEUEP4,Perfect just as described I don't know what else to say but thanks I couldn't be more happy thanks a lot,1394323200,,104,4.0
8466663,2,B005DEUEP4,"It's kind of lame, hence the Elvira hostess!  Likely considered fairly good ""back in the day"".  But if you like Elvira, then get it and add to your collection.",1341273600,,159,4.448275862068965
8466664,4,B005DEUEP4,"This double dose of Elvira includes two episodes starring female descendants of Frankenstein. The first is Lady Frankenstein. It's a movie that starts off a little slow, but it does become a pretty fun movie once the monster is created and goes on a violent rampage. Meanwhile, Elvira's ""son"" visits. The son is played by cutie Thomas Dekker. They should take that gimmick and make it a movie. It could be called Son of Elvira. Lord knows we need another Elvira movie.
The second episode included on this disc is Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter. It's a mostly boring movie that doesn't have the best lighting in the world. But things finally pick up steam when the monster is created in the third act of the movie. Elvira knows this one isn't good, too. She even refers to it as ""junk"" at one point.
All in all, this is worth buying if you're an Elvira fan. And don't forget to pick up Elvira's Movie Macabre: Wild Women in May. I know I won't forget.",1335225600,4,961,4.528735632183908
8466665,4,B005DEUEP4,"Same quality as all her shows so if you are an Elvira fan you must get this.
Too bad you can't run just the movie like ya can the Mystry 3000 movies. Maybe if they release anymore it will have the feature of with Elvira or without or just Elvira.",1331596800,,246,3.94
8466666,5,B005DEUEP4,"That ""Piece that everybody's dyin' to rest in"", Elvira, is back with another Double Feature DVD from her new and improved ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"" TV show.

 This time, Elvira features two ""Frankenstein"" related movies.

 Keep in mind: Many people make the mistake of thinking that Frankenstein is the big green guy with the bolts in his neck and the stitches in his head. Actually, that guy is The Monster.
 Frankenstein is actually the MAD DOCTOR who made The Monster!

  Lady Frankenstein is about this smoking hot woman (not as hot as Elvira, but few are) who ruins her beauty by having a butt ugly fascination with...you guessed it.....playing God with dead bodies.

  Her father tries to keep his princess out of the ""body business"", but like many princesses, the spoiled (yet hot) brat gets her way eventually.

  The film is pretty watchable....hot nutjob scientist lady, snowy backdrops, goofball characters, etc.

  Add Elvira to the mix to make fun of the madness, and you have an entertaining movie experience.

 Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter is about......well..I don't know what it's about and I've seen it about five times now. I don't think the producer/director even knows what's it's about.

 It's one of those movies where things happen, yet, nothing really happens......if you know what I mean.

You wonder why they wasted film on what they filmed with it.....yeah one of THOSE movies.

 Still, with the outlaw Jesse James, and yet another demented spawn from the shallow Frankenstein family gene pool, you have yet another nutjob scientist movie (Nevermind ""cowboys""...Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be scientists!) that, by itself is probably as entertaining as watching Mitt Romney watching paint dry. But thanks to that Hostess with the most-ess, Elvira, this movie is also entertaining....kind of.

 All in all, you will enjoy this freaky Frankenstein fest because Elvira is at her best.

P.S. You may want to put the kids to bed before watching this DVD....yowza!

Unpleasant Dreams.....",1313539200,6,2034,5.1189024390243905
