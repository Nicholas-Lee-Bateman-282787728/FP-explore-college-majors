8706077,4,B00UGPP32Y,"Mob boss Robinson decides to retire and pursue a life in search of class. It doesnt work out, and when he returns years later to reclaim his business and his girlfriend, everything has changed. Anne Sothern is perfect as the ditzy girlfriend, and Robinson gives  his usual solid performance in this comedy/drama. There is also an epic fist fight between Robinson and his rival, Humphrey Bogart. This is a well-made and entertaining movie.",1482796800,,438,5.0
