507830,3,630271544X,"I enjoyed ""The Comrades of Summer.""  It had better baseball than a lot of sports movies, and the characters were engaging and entertaining.  The situation of a hotshot manager who is brought down to earth by his own greed and over-reaching is a cautionary tale for all of us who think the world is our oyster.  Having a railroad track running through your practice field's infield gives new meaning to the term ""bad hop.""  I thought this was very funny stuff.",1213747200,4,459,4.62962962962963
507831,5,630271544X,"I love this movie. Imagine a spoiled, pampered American baseball player getting talked into teaching the ""All American Sport"" to a team of Russian athletes, most of which have never played the game. I thought Joe Mantegna was great in this roll. The wheeling and dealing with the Russian ""underworld"" for just about everything they need is hilarious and very believable.

But as it goes with many of the great older movies, American studio execs still have not released this movie to DVD. And then they wonder why so much ""bootlegging"" is going on! I'll keep looking to replace my VHS with DVD, even if it means buying a bootleg copy. This is a great movie and I don't want to wait around for it to maybe show up on some overpriced premium channel. Why is it that the crappy ""slice and dice"" gore movies make it to DVD and the really good ones don't? Again, I'll never understand the American studio execs. Maybe their tie is cutting off the circulation to their brain!",1188518400,12,969,4.568965517241379
507832,4,630271544X,"Come on guys ! This one was very funny ! Joe Mantegna teaching baseball to Russians ?! In Russia !? I am already louphing !
 And some of the russians get offended ??? It is a comedy , with using GROTESQUE at it's best ! The "" russian party "" , after winning a game against cubans ( the fact itself - russians beat cubans in baseball , already hilarious ), when they drink vodka out of the bottles , than everybody sleeping and snoring ! Isn't it already a clue for you - it is A comedy . And it is a good one .",1032739200,5,510,3.811320754716981
507833,2,630271544X,"a fun movie.  my biggest problem was with joe mantegna...i just couldn't picture him as a baseball player.  i'm a huge baseball fan, and think you would like this film more if you are not really into baseball, but just have a general knowledg of the game.  it certainly wasn't a ""good"" movie but it has funny scenes, and is playful.  certainly not in the league of other baseball movies, though.",985478400,,395,4.52112676056338

7830650,4,630271544X,"Adding another to the queue in my quiet crusade to get the word out about 'lost' HBO films.

Extremely funny and enjoyable story about a Pete Rose-like baseball player/manager. A self-aggrandizing boor who is detested by the team's owner, other coaches, and even his own players. But he delivers wins. And that brings in the fans, which in turns means the money flows when he's in charge, so everyone puts up with his ever-demanding ego.

But fate can be oh-so-twisted.

Sparky Smith, baseball's hard-charging leadoff jerk becomes permanently injured - but not during a ball game. Nope. In fact, he tears his ACL while pimping for a car commercial. Much to the delight of just about everyone, but especially his boss. Why? Because it was an unauthorized off-field injury - his playing contract is negated. He's screwed.

His former highness is soon out of baseball. Broke, vilified, and pathetically alone; having burned his professional bridges, there's nothing left.

So he's shocked when a call comes for his services as a manager. That anyone would even give him a chance is a minor miracle in and of itself. But that's where things turn interesting. The call comes from the Russian Sports Federation, former apparatchik of the recently-deceased Soviet Union. And they have a dream.

Sparky has been asked to lead their national team to the Olympics.

Problem: The Russians don't have a team. Additionally, they don't have: A stadium, coaches (except 'Manuel'), equipment, or baseball players. In fact, the only thing they have is a logo. That's the entirety of their Olympic hopes: A drawing.

Thus begins a hilarious fish-out-of-water tale with one lone American sitting in the cold bowels of Moscow trying to field a baseball team made up of throwaways and rejects from more prominent Russian sports like hockey, weghtlifting and tennis.

Absolutely loved the depiction of the early days of the collapse which engenders some insanely funny scenes as Sparky has to wheel-n-deal for absolutely everything. Trading pornography for baseballs and bats, wristwatches for food, compact disc players for toilet paper, etc. All funneled through Milov - his newly born capitalist/interpreter/cab driver/commodities trader and all-around-jackski-of-all-tradeskis; hilariously portrayed by veteran character actor John Fleck.

Movie Note:

- Those unfamiliar with Baseball may not understand that a baseball ""Manager"" is known as the Head Coach in most other sports. And the actual job of managing a baseball team's off-field and business issues is known as the ""GM"" (General Manager). One of the best and starkest examples showing the difference between the jobs was the recent, and completely amazing film, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moneyball/dp/B0060ZJ7BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moneyball</a>' with Brad Pitt.",1331856000,2,2856,5.527522935779817
7830651,4,630271544X,"Comrades of Summer is not the greatest movie ever made.  It won't change your life, or bring world peace.  But it is incredibly funny and well written.  Joe Mantegna is great in the role of Sparky.  His gruff annoyance at being sent to Russia to teach has been athletes from other sports how to play baseball is perfectly funny, and original.  It's just a shame that HBO won't put it out on DVD.  I recorded it off the TV when it first aired, and wore it out in a few months and never saw it on again.",1235347200,4,501,4.11340206185567
7830652,5,630271544X,awesome movie to watch again and again. makes you feel good and who doesn't need that these days? get it. you will love it.,1233619200,2,123,4.166666666666667
