4467429,5,B004ULEENE,This was a gift for a friend of mine.  He had been looking for this movie for a long time.  He was very happy to get it.,1329264000,2,120,3.4074074074074074
4467430,3,B004ULEENE,"How come there are so many bad reviews for this movie, linda carter in her prime running around in skin tight outfits with no bra plus a few nude scenes with her tig bitty's is a very good reason to celebrate!",1320278400,9,209,4.121951219512195
4467431,2,B004ULEENE,"The high point of this flick is Lynda Carter bares one breast.  That's right one breast.  So impressed were the makers of this ho-hum affair of this singular shot of Carter's mammary gland that they used it twice.  Carter, the selling point here for those who went through puberty with ""Wonder Woman"", basically rides shotgun to Marjoe Gortner's Outlaw.  In fairness to Gortner he's pretty charismatic here.  Carter on the other hand was a more credible actress on ""Battle of the Network Stars"".  Not to lay all the blame on Carter the film is directed in fairly ham-handed fashion by Mark L. Lester, no relation to the kid who played Oliver.  Lester aspires to make a latter day ""Bonnie and Clyde"" but he doesn't meet the standards of ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"".  The film was obviously made by film school grads because they name a deputy sheriff Abel Gance, a reference to the French silent filmmaker who made ""Napoleon"".  Not only is this affair boring it's pretentious!  I know this is standard drive-in affair but the makers should have taken their cues from Roger Corman in how to make a low-budget programmer with resonance.",1316476800,9,1131,4.783505154639175
4467432,4,B004ULEENE,"whoever knew wonder woman was such a shooting woman,this movie proved that even a TV star can do something other than play a comic book character on tv,why to go?",1314662400,2,162,4.433333333333334
4467433,4,B004ULEENE,"I ordered this title from Amazon, but the DVD that came had the film 'Call of the Wild' with Charlton Heston on the actual disc and menu, despite having disc and cover art that said Bobbie Jo & the Outlaw. I returned it and got a replacement copy. The replacement had the same exact problem! After that, Amazon issued me a full refund and sent a third replacement copy, promising that the new batch of DVD's was now correct. It was.

The video and audio quality on this title is very good. I'm glad this movie has seen the light of day. If you're a Lynda Carter fan, or just a fan of 70's cinema, definitely check it out.",1307404800,12,621,4.218487394957983
4467434,1,B004ULEENE,"After YEARS of waiting for Bobbie Jo & the Outlaw to FINALLY arrive on DVD, I regret to inform the buying public that the copy I bought thru an AMAZON SELLER (DOES NOT PLAY) on my DVD PLAYER, despite the information presented on the site/& package. It states it's expected to play on DVD Players, but not necessarily DVD RECORDER & PC's. This is the same title/DVD that is an Amazon Exclusive that is also being sold by Amazon Sellers/EBAY sellers etc.

The disc doesn't even play in DVD Players, just freezes the machine/constantly spins the disc. After 3 tries I removed the disc & prepared it for shipping for a COMPLETE refund. It's a GREAT SHAME, as I was under the impression (as many would be) that these NEW ""ON DEMAND"" Limited Edition titles should work. Because MGM decided not to OFFICIALLY release Bobbie Jo & the Outlaw on DVD (as they worry it wouldn't be cost effective/weak market for a Cult 70's film that only would attract a particular demographic i.e. Lynda Carter fans/drive-in style films), they've decided to market it thru AMAZON in an ON DEMAND style-fashion, which sounded like a fantastic alternative but at the moment is a BUST!

The title is actually under REVIEW, as likely many people other than myself are having issues with it. Once again, a real shame as this is a Cult 70's drive-in classic that I'm sure many of you were looking forward to possibly seeing. I welcome anyone else to write & mention their experiences with this ON DEMAND title & if they had similar issues?

Hopefully in the VERY NEAR future, Amazon will work with MGM to redo Bobbie Jo & the Outlaw (corrected & free of flaws) so this title can be enjoyed by the fans of the film/Carter. It's a complete waste when a long awaited title is given this particular treatment as it seems it was a rush job. Another title I had planned to buy was FUTUREWORLD (1976) yet with the recent trouble with OUTLAW I'm a bit hesitant.

Also worth mentioning, the folks at Amazon that I tried contacting had ZERO information as to the OUTLAW & the various depts. could only create a trouble ticket & had no Contact Info on the higher-ups that actually are familiar with the title & arranged for it's distribution in the 1st place.",1307404800,32,2216,4.574307304785894

4467477,5,B004ULEENE,The quality of the movie was very good for as old as it was. Lynda Carter (Wonder Woman) in several topless sex scenes was icing on the cake.

4467481,3,B004ULEENE,"I bought the movie for Linda Carter and as it was on my wish list for a while I bought it.
  Saying that I wish I could have seen the movie first before buying it.  I did not care for this movie.  Even liking 60 movies this was not very good in my opinion.  The acting was poor in points and the movie dragged and I really had a hard time liking anyone in the movie.  It was made early in Linda Carters career and showed it.  I saw another movie with the same plot I liked much better.
  I almost cheered at the end when it was over and the credits came up.  But if you like ""I fought the law and the law won"" movies from the 60 then this is for you.  It was not a family movie and if you are offended by drugs and alcohol use then this is not for you either.
  I should have given this a lower rating, but there were sens with Linda Carter that I liked and as that is why I bought the movie it made the price not as wasted for me.",1390521600,,931,3.7371134020618557
4467482,2,B004ULEENE,"First of all, I would like to point out that Lynda Carter regretted very much doing this movie as she had indicated in an interview.  She is completely unlike the loose and foolish character which she portrayed in that movie. She also would not have fallen for a loser like the guy she is with in the film.  She had just been chosen Miss America a few years before this film. Bob Hope himself told all the girls where the winner would stand and go and Lynda's response was; ""Where do you want me to stand?"" She was just joking of course and she wound up winning anyway rather ironically. Bob Hope was completely charmed by her and had Lynda travel and perform on his USO Christmas show that year. I happen to know that Lynda is a warm sensitive woman whose biggest love in life has always been her family.  I get upset when people speak of her feminine attributes as if her breasts are the only thing that makes her so beautiful.  All those extra parts are nothing without her truly beautiful face.  Her face has always been so angelic and naturally beautiful that she has always been the only woman who could have pulled off playing a Princess as she portrayed on Wonder Woman.  That is why Hollywood has not been successful in finding another actress who could pull off playing that character.  Lynda Carter also is very charismatic and so utterly charming and beautiful that very few other actresses could ever hold a candle to her.  Debra Winger who got her start as an actress in Wonder Woman and is very over rated, was very jealous and ungrateful for her opportunity on the show and so decided to bad mouth Lynda.  Lynda who was very surprised confronted Winger about her comments and then simply blew it off being the lady she is. More than we can say for Winger.  Lynda Carter is an accomplished actress and Singer and Wife and Mother and Larry King and millions continue to love her for right and wrong reasons.  I own all of Lynda Carters movies  but not because of her breasts but because she is something special and so inwardly beautiful as she is ecstatically.
 By all means watch this film but not for obvious reasons.  Watch it for entertainment only. Lynda plays a bad girl in it but she did refuse to do completely nude scenes. She just showed a bit more of herself than she ever did again in any movie and definitely not after Wonder Woman because children loved and respected and envied her.
If there ever was a true Wonder Woman, it would certainly be Lynda Carter, then and now.
Lynda I Love You!!!",1390262400,,2521,4.4640522875816995
4467483,5,B004ULEENE,It was good to see Lynda Carter in such a different role than she usually plays a good rebel movie reminiscent of Spaghetti Westerns grab some popcorn and enjoy!!!,1390262400,,163,4.655172413793103
4467484,5,B004ULEENE,"This is a B movie at best with some silly acting, really poor editing, sometimes laughable special effects, and a goofy plot rife with clichs.  BUT IT IS, I believe, the only movie in which Wonder Woman Linda Carter appears topless, and in my opinion she is one of the most beautiful, sexy women I have ever seen in my more than 60 years on this planet.  For me, it is worth owning for that reason alone.

The quality of the DVD is actually pretty good, considering the source material they had to work with.",1389744000,3,508,4.326315789473684
4467485,3,B004ULEENE,"The only reason anyone would be interested in this movie is for Lynda Carter's boobs. They are fantastic. She has two love scenes and a skinny dipping scene in which she shows them. Also, she has a nice scene where she changes her shirt and show a LOT of side boob. Well worth the price of admission.",1388361600,,300,4.280701754385965
4467486,3,B004ULEENE,You got to be a Linda Carter fan to in joy this movie. She dose got nice tits. but the acting needs a lot of work. It would of been better if they showed a little bush on her,1382227200,,174,3.4871794871794872
4467487,2,B004ULEENE,"The vhs was very very poor extended play and was zoomed in a bit.  The new dvd is hacked off the top and bottom but does show a very very tiny bit more on the sides.  (very very very tiny bit).  I have determined this by comparing some caps of the dvd from dvdtalk.com to the vhs.  They state that it is 1.85:1.  Wrong. Amazon is correct this time as simple division of the size of the still calculates to 1.77.  (16X9).  The imdb says it was shot on 35mm and is suppose to be 1.85.  Well, maybe maybe not. Since 35mm film was formated several different ways.
  When looking for a proper aspect for this movie, just check the changing scene at the beginning.  If you don't see the top of Lynda's nipple on the ""close up"" shot when she is putting her top ""on"" then the bottom is cropped.
This was cropped in both the vhs and I'm sure the dvd.
  Still, we have no propper copy of this film.  Lets face it.  It was a bad movie, and the only reason anyone ever buy's it is for Lynda Carter's brief partial nudes which should have been better.
  The director was an idiot.",1372550400,,1067,4.126829268292683
4467488,5,B004ULEENE,At the start of vhs movies she was our favorites and she can act . her and Marjoe Gortner work together really well! I thought I would never get to see this movie again Amazon Thank you for having my favorite movie!,1371772800,,215,4.142857142857143
4467489,3,B004ULEENE,"Before Lynda Carter got that phone call informing her she'd be America's favorite bullet-deflecting, satin tight wearing super she-ro, she starred in this cheapie flick produced by American International Studios. This outfit basically produced every exploitation flick from the 69s and 70s; back then they were mainly shown in drive-ins, usually as double features, where teen audiences were not so discriminating (for obvious reasons). Bobbie Jo and the Oulaw is a perfect example of this particular strain of cheapie - in 1976, fast cars, drugs and boobs were necessary ingredients, and thanks to films like Bonnie and Clyde and Robert Altman's Thieves Like Us, rebel outlaws were too. And one other element was rising in popularity - the small-bit country singer who's got his/her sight on being a star. Here that's represented by Lynda Carter, who gets a chance to showcase her singing chops, albeit just briefly.

So the plot is nothing at all special, but here's a quick recap: Lyle Wheeler (Marjoe Gortner), who fancies himself a fast draw in the tradition of Billy the Kid, swipes the car of a leather salesman, and from there takes the life of an outlaw, beguiling a fresh faced drive-in waitress named Bobbie Jo (Carter) in the process. One act of crime leads to another, and before long, the duo become a fivesome, now including Bobbie's best friend Essie (Belinda Balaski), sister Pearl (Merrie Lynn Ross), and Pearl's boyfriend Slick (Jessie Vint). The band vows to defend each other to the death, with the exception of Essie, who notifies the cops of their whereabouts; she gets shot by the cops in the ensuing crossfire, strengthening the rest of the group's resolve to continue their criminal ways. Of course, it all comes down to a standoff in a motel room - the cops have the place surrounded, and riddle Lyle and his gang with bullets. Only Bobbie survives... maybe she'll get to the Grand Ol' Opry after all.

Loaded with clichs and rife with pretty low production values, Bobbie is, nonetheless, surprisingly entertaining for its ilk, in part because its writing is fairly crisp and convincing, and well-acted to boot. Lyle's character feels fresh and interesting, despite being based on so many other film archetypes - his actions come with mantra - from his attitude toward stealing and killing (only in self defense, otherwise it's evil) to death itself, evidenced by his eulogy for Essie. Carter also does an interesting job transforming her character from one of goo-eyed adoration for Lyle, to skepticism of his shady ways, to addiction to their lifestyle together and ultimate glee for the crimes she helps commit.

If the film has any major flaw, it's probably the absence of a rooting interest. The film does seem to side with Lyle, as the cops tend to be brutal pigs whereas Lyle does have a vague moral code. But quite frankly I wanted him captured pretty early on. Part of the brilliance in Bonnie and Clyde was the way it got you to like these two bank robbers, and then pull the rug out from under you when they perish in a hail of gunfire at the end (still a shocker).

All right, all right - by now you're wondering, how are Lynda Carter's nude scenes. Just remember this was still 1976, so they didn't go too far (this isn't Skinemax after all). There is one darkly-lit shot of topless lovemaking, but you see it only from the side, and only briefly. (Evidently they could only get Carter to do this once, so they literally used the same shot again later in a different scene.) So in a nutshell: only fair. But for my money it's Balaski who puts in a better show. Not only does she do the lion's share of nudity (especially in the ""magic mushroom"" skinny-dipping scene), but she plays a delightfully appealing, quirky character that presages some of her later film work, particularly that with director Joe Dante.

This may be a tough film to find, but if you can locate it, it's worth 86 minutes of your time, if for nothing else than as a trip back in time. Afternoon delight, anyone?",1368403200,14,4024,4.767575322812052
