I wanted to know what was around 'the next bend'.  My hamstrings got sore because I was pushing myself so hard to keep going but I didn't wanna stop!  This has never happened to me while exercising before.  Usually, I'm focused on the clock, just willing the time to hurry up and  go by so I can quit. I also thought the music would get on my nerves. Every now and then a segment would come on that I didn't like so much, but most of the time the music complemented the stretch of road you were on. If you don't like it, just play a Nature CD with bird song or whatever.  If I had the money, I'd buy many, many more. Do keep one thing in mind (and this is my only complaint).  When I watch this on a smallish screen (14"" X 10"") the picture is crystal clear, however, when I watch it on our big screen (36"" X 24"") the clarity of the picture definitely is a little fuzzier.  However, this might be because this was designed for a full screen?  This might be why its $5.00 cheaper than the wide screen format.  Anyhow, if you're not sure if you'll get into these DVD's or not, this one is a pretty good 'sampler' of what's available since you go through different terrain. Some city, some coast, some woods, some mountains.  Its kind of like biking these places with no 'reality' to diminish your pleasure.  No bugs, no heat, no cold wind in your face,  no irate motorists getting angry with you for going so slow, no wondering where the next bathroom is!  I WANT MORE!",1390608000,,1594,4.203947368421052
8118679,5,B000F7NXWU,"The time just flew by while I was streaming down the road (on my treadmill). I've really got to try these on my indoor bike. I'm getting much stronger and my muscles are toning up nicely, because I'm finally exercising consistently. So far I've bought most of the available Bike-O-Vision DVDs and will buy more. I had to watch the California Coastline twice. It's my definite favorite. This one, Northern California, was so real to me that I was almost smelling the evergreen trees. I love those winding mountain roads and then we were in San Francisco. Now I don't normally drive that fast, especially downhill. I was pretty sure we were going to hit something, but we didn't. When the music changed, a couple of times I just had to smile. They were good choices for the situation.

I usually come up with suggestions on these to end my review with, so let me think. Kauai, La Jolla, Talimena Drive (Arkansas-Oklahoma), I've already suggested those. AH YES!!! Cape Cod.  Make it and I'll buy it.

Thanks, Bike-O-Vision. This is fun!",1267228800,,1033,4.696132596685083
8118680,3,B000F7NXWU,"I live in an area with treacherous traffic and no bike lanes, so as a result my only means of cycling for exercise is at home. The DVD does a good job of providing great views with instrumental music that never gets in the way. On the downside though, the video is fullscreen which died out with VHS, and the worst part of all is the video constantly cuts to different scenes. You'll be enjoying a nice ride down a road when all of a sudden the camera is looking at something to the right then next thing you know it quick cuts to a completely different location or town altogether! Seeing the side mirrors of the vehicle in some shots was also a mood-killer. I would rather see a cycling video recorded by someone on a bicycle, or at the very least a motorcycle. Keep the camera pointed forward, and save the scenery that is to the sides for occasional pull-offs into rest stops or scenic spots but keep it one continuous shot rather than all these quick edits.",1236038400,2,962,4.35

The dvds are clear, fun and almost as though you are on the road with the camera. I love my bike-o-vision set..almost like being there.",1216598400,,243,4.809523809523809
8118682,4,B000F7NXWU,"Overall, this is a good product.  Most of the time though, this DVD makes me feel like I'm riding in a car, not riding on a bike.  But it does help my biking time go by more quickly and that's the whole point.  If you are looking for a more realistic biking DVD, try ""Rides Volume 1-the Rockies"" or ""Rides Volume 2-Las Vegas/Valley of Fire"" (both by Endurance Films).  They are the best ones I've seen.",1171238400,3,402,4.25
