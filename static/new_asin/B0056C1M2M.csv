4587897,5,B0056C1M2M,"I enjoyed this film! As most people already know from ""The King's Speech"", King George VI never intended nor desired to be king. This documentary is a fascinating look at how he reconciled himself with the role, and became an inspiration to his nation.

Highlights include original footage of the King's life, interviews with the of grandson Lionel Logue, and commentary from the cast and crew of ""The King's Speech"".

Definitely worth the purchase. Inspiring man, inspiring film.",1312848000,8,480,5.141025641025641
4587898,5,B0056C1M2M,"I loved The King's Speech, so to learn even more about the background of King George VI was fascinating to me!  It's really great to hear the genuine thoughts of Colin Firth and Tom Hooper, as well as, the speech therapists grandson, too!",1312329600,4,238,4.534883720930233
4587899,5,B0056C1M2M,Nothing compared to the King's Speech but definitely a must see documentary for those who enjoyed watching the King's Speech. It's very informational and inspiring. Gives your an inside exclusive on the King and his struggles with stuttering. I really enjoyed watching the historic footages of King George. I was quite surprised to see Colin Firth do a commentary.

4587919,5,B0056C1M2M,"I loved the movie ""The Kings Speech"" because it covered some little known history about King George. He was an incredibly brave man who gave his life to his county, just like his daughter 'Queen Elizabeth"" has done in her lifetime. The most interesting part about the abdication is that I was unaware that Edward had popular support for his marriage to Wallis Simpson. Although it is very sad that their love caused him to have to abdicate, she was a very unsuitable individual to be at the head of Great Britain. Not because of her multiple marriages, but because she was extremely indiscrete, had several relationships while she was involved with Edward. I think this documentary was actually kind to both of them as Edward's involvement with Hitler and her involvement with the German ambassador to Great Britain could have made Great Britain a part of Germany. They both were very foolish and self-involved people and had no place in being heads of state. Although it is very interesting to follow the personal lives of the Royal family, ultimately the Royal family has an enormous privilege and responsibility to the citizens they represent. This is a serious job for serious people.",1415836800,7,1188,4.8861386138613865

4587923,5,B0056C1M2M,I have wanted to know about the real King Edward the 6th since I watched the Kings Speech. It was very informative. There was so much I did not know about him before the movie and this DVD. Thanks. AWH,1406332800,,201,4.05
4587924,2,B0056C1M2M,"This is a rehash of years of Public Television British royalty adoration.  Colin Firth's name is used as a lure: he is not the star of the show, he only makes a short cameo appearance.  Since it costs more to watch this old newsreel paste up than to rent the movie, you could well ask where the value is.",1393545600,,304,4.135593220338983

4587928,5,B0056C1M2M,"The Man behind Kings Speech is an inspiring historical fact presented in a very lively and uplifting way. It is a story of a monarch who rose to the challenges of the WWII, one of the most challenging human conflicts of the 20th Century.  King George VI and Winston Churchill might be an example of the true statesmen we all long for at now days. This film is a great family entertainment",1375401600,,388,4.388888888888889
4587929,3,B0056C1M2M,I thought the film would spend more time on the speech therapist Logan.  Most of what was discussed in the video was about George VI and the information was not new.,1369699200,,165,4.32258064516129
4587930,4,B0056C1M2M,Enjoyed the bio of King George VI.  This movie supplied a lot more information about George VI and his family prior to and during his reign and end with the cornation of his daughter Elizabeth II.  The old film clip were great.,1365120000,,227,4.380952380952381
4587931,4,B0056C1M2M,"If you are looking for a lot of information on the speech therapist for King George VI, this documentary is more about the King than his speech therapist.  While there is footage of the therapist, it seems about 3/4ths of this documentary is about George who is a worthy and interesting subject.

There is excellent footage of George, his brother Edward who abdicated the throne, and George's wife and daughters.  You really get a sense of the times he lived through from 1937 to 1952 when he died at the young age of 56.  The film said he was a heavy smoker and had never been in great health.

This film is more on the making of a king with the speech therapist as one huge factor in his success as monarch, but it really covers the span of 15 years when George is King and the therapist had 80 visits with him in the beginning years of his reign.

If you would be fascinated to gain insight into Queen Elizabeth's father and family, you should enjoy this film.  It will be interesting to see if William and Catherine name a future son George in honor and reference to this king who was thrust unwillingly into the throne and became beloved by his country as he stayed in London to comfort and calm during the bombings of WWII. I loved hearing in this film Churchill's comment to George's wife at his coronation that ""the other would never have done,"" referring to King Edward who gave up the throne to marry Mrs. Simpson.",1363392000,,1424,4.412213740458015
4587932,5,B0056C1M2M,I love the movie The Kings Speech and this gave me a in depth view of the true story of King George the 6 and his speech therapist. If you like the movie you will enjoy this documentary.,1362960000,5,186,3.9210526315789473
4587933,5,B0056C1M2M,"Once you've watched King's Speech (~2008), this historical footage and documentary is an excellent follow-on to help place the subject precisely in time, in the history of England and in world history.  This footage is useful watched either before or after seeing the movie.  We saw the movie in theatres, the purchased and viewed this historical footage.  Great insights into the man, his country, and the turbulent times into which he was born to lead, despite overwhelming handicap odds.",1362700800,,490,5.177215189873418
4587934,4,B0056C1M2M,I really enjoyed this historic retrospective. It enlightened me about King George VI and his formative years. I only wish it had been longer and elaborated a bit more on his relationship with his speech therapist. A good companion DVD for the movie.,1360368000,3,249,4.813953488372093

4587937,5,B0056C1M2M,I loved this film because it was such a great accompaniment to the film. It is a truly touching tale that brings you into the life of King George VI and really allows you to empathize with what he was going through.,1317686400,5,215,4.142857142857143
4587938,5,B0056C1M2M,I loved this film. Being able to learn about the actual man behind the infamous speech was not only informative but uplifting and exciting. Anyone who has sent he academy award film must see this now!,1317168000,4,200,4.583333333333333
4587939,5,B0056C1M2M,"This is another WONDERFUL companion piece to the Academy Award Winning film ""The King's Speech"". About a month ago I reviewed a title ""The King Speaks"" which focuses on Lionel Logue - the speech therapist who taught King George VI to reduce his stuttering. This hour long documentary (apparently aired on ITV in the UK in connection with the feature film) Spends more time on the King himself, from inheriting the throne when his brother King Edward abdicated the throne in 1936 though his death at the young age of 52 and the subsequent coronation of his eldest daughter who became Queen Elizabeth II.

This is a fascinating extension of the all-too-brief featurette that was included on the DVD release of the Colin Firth-starring film from Sony (see my review of that film on Amazon.). The Sony film included one small except of archival footage of King George VI - the ""stuttering king"". Here we get much more!

Actor First makes a brief appearance as does the Sony film's director and the author of the book. Logue is covered only briefly with some comments by his grandson. Most of the commentary comes from interview with Tim Ewart, identified as a ""Royal Correspondent"". The rest is culled from fascinating newsreel footage.

The ""bonus features"" here are also nice, except for what is listed as the ""Trailer"". This is nothing more than the first 2  minutes of the documentary. The others include George's speech at the unveiling of the statue of his father, George V (4-minutes), Newsreel of George V's visit to Cape Cape Town (7-minutes) and the christening of the baby Prince Charles (3-minutes). In the later we see FOUR generations of the Royal Family from Queen Mary to her great Grandson Prince Charles.

If you liked the TKS film, then I highly recommend that you watch this DVD. (For more on Logue see ""The King Speaks"" from BFS. If you haven't, get TKS and enjoy it. THEN watch this film.
