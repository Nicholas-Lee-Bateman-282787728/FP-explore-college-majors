479797,5,6302561825,"This film has two great elements, Charlie Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"" character, and the circus.  I grew up in a time where Big Top circuses still set up canvas tents in large grassy plots just outside of town.

But I digress.

I enjoyed this film because it was fun to watch.  Its got plenty of slapstick humor, a good story, and classic moments.

The story is simple.  The Little Tramp is hanging around outside of a circus, trying to find a way to get something to eat.  A pick pocket steals a man's wallet, and plants it on the tramp.  Both men get chased through the hall of mirrors and the tramp ends up doing some unintended slapstick funniness under the big top while trying to elude the police.  The mean circus owner loves the idea that the audience is laughing, and gives the tramp a job without telling him he is a hit.  The tramp befriends and falls for the circus owner's daughter, a beautiful young trapeze artist who is being physically and emotionally abused by her father.  When the girl falls in love with a young and handsome tightrope walker, the heart broken tramp is no longer funny during the show, and the circus owner threatens to fire him.

I am not going to tell you anymore about the story because I don't want to give too much away, but there are definitely some very funny bits in this movie that are worth the price of admission.  The scene where the tramp is accidentally locked into a lion's cage is a classic Chaplin moment, and so is the tightrope walking scene where the tramp is up on the high wire and the hold back cable that is keeping him balanced breaks, and while he is fighting to maintain his balance, he has to deal with a group of uncooperative monkeys .  I found this to be one of the most Keaton-esque stunts that Chaplin has ever done.  It definitely sends the pulse racing.

The ending was something that was a bit disappointing.  I understand why it had to end that way, but when I watch a comedy, I don't want to feel sad at the end.  However, if you are going to sit through a Chaplin movie, you have to accept the fact that he is going to suck the emotion out of you one way or the other.  It was his unique style of storytelling and film making, and for audiences of his day, it gave an emotional depth that was not readily seen in silent films, especially comedy.

Whether you like Chaplin's use of pathos or not, there is no denying that this is a highly entertaining film.  I definitely recommend it.",1384819200,3,2457,4.356043956043956
479798,5,6302561825,"Chaplins third United Artists feature film after A Woman Of Paris and The Gold Rush is perhaps one of his less memorable films, but it is still a good one, with a beautiful opening scene of a girl on a trapeze, which Wim Wenders probably had in mind when he did a similar scene in Wings Of Desire; the opening scene also has a pretty song sun by Chaplin himself, with very nice lyrics. Most of the biggest laughs right up front, including a funny scene where the Tramp is mistaken for a pickpocketer, and all sorts of nutty run-from-the-law type situations, including a nutty chase through a hall of mirrors, and the Tramp imitating an automaton to evade detection. A room of sad clowns. A funny audition scene where the Tramp improves each of the standard comedy scenes he is in through accidents and improvisations but the circus boss is too blind to see it. We get a scene of Professor Bosco (who appears in many Chaplin pieces, sometimes played by Chaplin himself, such as in his flea circus short). Theres a funny scene in a lions cage, with a tiger thrown in to boot (hard to believe such a valuable performer such as Chaplin actually would have stepped into the den like that). Theres even some funny dialogue:

 - Ill pay you sixty. No  Ill double it!!
 - I won't settle for anything less than a hundred.

Theres an inventive scene when the Tramp fantasizes about beating up a romantic rival, his ghost stepping out of his body and doing the deed. A great finale with Charlie on the high rope, amazing, and then some sort of ironic, moralistic, all-too-neat happy ending to cap it off.",1382486400,,1593,4.517361111111111

479800,5,6302561825,"As great as Charlie Chaplin's THE CIRCUS is, it's still a relatively under-appreciated film. Released in 1928, it falls between two masterpieces, THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and CITY LIGHTS (1931), and THE CIRCUS has always been regarded as bridging the two, existing in a sort of cinema limbo. It's a film that's hardly brought up in discussions about Chaplin, and when it does get mentioned the customary reaction is, ""Oh yeah, THAT one!"" In all fairness, THE CIRCUS is right up there with Chaplin's best work, earning the genius comedian an honorary statuette at the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929.

THE CIRCUS provides the perfect setting for Chaplin's Little Tramp, as what can be more fitting for a clown than performing under the Big Top? The film contains some of Chaplin's richest comic routines involving a fun house, a hall of mirrors, and a tightrope walk disrupted by monkeys. It also ends with one of Chaplin's most poignant images of the tramp, having lost the girl (Merna Kennedy) to a rival (Harry Crocker), sitting alone on a box in the middle of the ring once occupied by the circus tent.

The MK2 Editions 2-disc set of THE CIRCUS is sharp with excellent clarity and contrast. The beautiful music score, which Chaplin composed for the film's 1970 re-release, is presented in standard and 5.1 audio. Chaplin also sang the theme song, which is sublime in its simplicity and sets the bittersweet tone of the film.

The array of special features on the second disc includes a documentary, a deleted sequence, outtakes, home movies, footage of THE CIRCUS' premiere, 3-D test footage by cinematographer Rollie Totheroh, photo and poster galleries, and various trailers.

479842,5,6302561825,"Charlie Chaplin`s The Circus (1928) has long been considered something akin to Beethoven's 4th Symphony, which composer Robert Schumann referred to as ""a Greek maiden between two Norse gods (the Eroica and the Fifth)."" The Circus is the the maiden between two certifiable Chaplin masterpieces: The Gold Rush (1925) and City Lights (1931). Yet, Beethoven's Fourth, seen without Schumann's assessing lens, has, on occasion, proven to be a maiden unleashed, as in Carlos Kleiber's live, mercurial Munich version (on DVD) and Herbert Von Karajan's devastatingly sensuous 1963 performance with the BPO.

Like Beethoven's 4th, The Circus is an underrated opus. Seen without the preconceived assessment of historians, it is an interesting gem. Oddly, it is the one film of Chaplin's that was recognized for a ""special"" Academy Award. Despite that, it is an infrequently revived (and discussed) film.

The filmmaker himself did not help the cause for The Circus. Chaplin's autobiography is interesting primarily as a career autobiography. Private, painful details are omitted. Quite tellingly, Chaplin never once mentioned this film in that autobiography. Clearly, he avoided it because this film was made while he was going through a highly embarrassing divorce from one of his child brides (Lita Grey) at the time. Intimate details from Chaplin's sex life were exposed to the public. According to Kenneth Anger`s ""Hollywood Babylon,"" Chaplin went through such an ordeal that during the divorce trial, the star's hair literally turned prematurely white.

Often, assessment of Chaplin's films include the biographical. A good example of this is Roger Ebert's review of The Circus. Ebert takes the often-traveled road of comparing Chaplin to Buster Keaton:

Chaplin was a considerable artist, brave and gifted, but I am in a minority in placing him second to Keaton among the silent clowns. My reasons for that are admittedly impulsive: I sense Keaton was the better man. Chaplin was so famous, so rich, so powerful when so young that there is a kind of conceit in the Tramp, a reverse noblesse oblige. Yes, he had a miserable childhood, and in his films, he often plays the friend of waifs, but there's an air of back-patting about it. The Buster Keaton character has his feet on the ground. He would be embarrassed to parade his goodness. He uses ingenuity rather than divinity. Chaplin's untidy love life suggests he felt he deserved whomever he wanted; Keaton in private life seems to have been melancholic because of alcoholism, but a decent enough sort with women.

The problem with Ebert's assessment of Chaplin is his objection to Chaplin's enormous success and his bullet point details of Chaplin's post-stardom biography. This view reduces Chaplin's films to the anecdotal. While remnants of personal history cannot be completely excluded in approaching Chaplin's art, his films, inevitably, transcend biography.

To be fair, Ebert is certainly correct in his comparison of the contrasting silent clown screen personas; Keaton's Stone Face never asked for audience sympathy in the obvious way that Chaplin's Tramp did. However, nor can Keaton identify with the everyman on Chaplin's level. The Tramp's poverty, which has nothing to do with the success of the actor playing the character, imbues him with an intimate personality that Keaton lacked. Out of all Chaplin's contemporaries, only Harry Langdon emerged with a comparable persona.

Ebert also makes a comparative notation regarding the amorous nature of the two clowns. To me, both Chaplin and Keaton are sexless, at least when filtered through a contemporary perspective. Chaplin's celibacy is that of the adolescent, as a people's priest. Keaton's character, while more intelligent and ambitious, is too phlegmatic for us to imagine him as anything other than chaste.

That Keaton was the more original filmmaker cannot be denied. His sense of aesthetic exploration is a model for early cinema. However, Chaplin proved more cunning in his business dealings. He never lost control of his films the way Keaton naively did. (Before he fatally lost artistic control to MGM, Keaton etched a celluloid character who embodied an admirable sense of detachment without resorting to overt populism).

The Circus finds Chaplin closest to Keaton territory, both in it's organic, innovative composition and its existential arc. The Circus emerges as a flawed, unique work of art, with the bleakest ending of all Chaplin's features. Desperation, contrasting with carnivalesque tinsel, evolves from the world of music hall pantomime and Max Linder, echoes Picasso's canvases of harlequins, and prefigures Fellini.

The Circus iris-ins on Merna (Merna Kennedy), riding bareback, bursting through a large star. Her ringmaster father (Al Garcia) becomes enraged when she misses the hoop on a second attempt. This misstep elicits a thrashing and period of starvation. Merna's act is followed by an ensemble of flabby, geriatric clowns. Al desperately needs a saving act.

Enter the Tramp, in an elaborate, virtuoso introduction. Starving, the Tramp is not above stealing food from a baby before he becomes the unwitting victim and pawn of a pickpocket. Wrongly accused, the Tramp runs for his life. He surrealistically mimics an animatronic prop in an amusement ride. Once discovered, he evades capture within a hall of mirrors (this scene surely influenced Orson Welles' Lady From Shanghai). This delightfully elongated vignette takes Charlie to the circus stage where he unknowingly becomes the hit of the show. The film's one conceit, which Chaplin could not resist, is in the audience crowning him as ""the Funny Guy.""

The Tramp is offered a job, as a prop man. The key to the Tramp's comic success is that his act is unintentional. Al shrewdly keeps his new employee in the dark, which, for awhile, isn't that hard to do. Charlie is the classic hobo, cooking his meager meal over an open fire, and sharing it with Merna, whom he is secretly in love with.

Naturally, several slapstick vignettes are in order. These involve the animal kingdom inhabitants of the circus. A jackass, a lion, a tiger, and monkeys on a high wire plague Charlie. While some of these bits are elaborately staged, none equal the freshness of the opening.

The Tramp discovers that he is the hit act, yet somehow this discovery does not dispel the performer's magic. However, the object of his affection is in love with trapeze artist Rex (Harry Crocker). The film ends with the Tramp exactly where he started. He accepts his fate without self-pity. Like us, he can understand his rejection, and the iris closes him off to us. Chaplin apparently hoped that iris would forever swallow up what he considered to be a best-forgotten opus. However, Chaplin cannot be trusted here as an objective judge or interpreter of his own work, which stands as a formidable maiden.

479848,5,6302561825,"This is a review for the WB release of Charlie Chaplin's THE CIRCUS,
a heretofore 1928 relative obscurity that only within the last
few years has reached prominance.

This release of THE CIRCUS is a double DVD set with the first disc
for the feature film and the second disc containing many interesting extras.
However, there is no running commentary to accompany THE CIRCUS itself,
which I think might have been an oversight on the part of the releasing
company. A knowledgable commentary track might've been helpful for
viewers who are not familiar with circuses, or silent movies, or Chaplin
himself.

The story involves the little tramp happening upon a domestic situation
in a circus camp.  A father, the circus operator, is maltreating his youngish
adult daughter and immediately the tramp takes up her cause. Eventually he worms
his way into a handyman type of job where each day, unbeknownst to the tramp, his
very public comical ineptness becomes more and more popular with the circus crowds.

The operator, no bumpkin he, works very hard to keep the little tramp unaware
that his public comic attempts at doing any kind of job eventually is what
keeps the circus in business.  Eventually, the tramp feels forced to learn how
to walk a tightrope in order to keep up with what he percieves to be his
romantic rival, a competitor for the daughter's hand.

If you've read this far you can imagine the monkey business that ensues
to keep the audience, both the circus's and the film's audience, amused
and I would say that Charlie Chaplin succeeded bigtime.  This is not
a spectacular production to rival something like THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH
but THE CIRCUS achieves its goals in a very pleasing and sentimental
fashion that has to be one of the many highlights of the little tramp's
great career.

I rate this overall package five stars without hesitation and the film of
THE CIRCUS itself more than that if I could.",1272758400,2,1926,4.7975830815709966
479849,5,6302561825,Charlie Chaplin and Danny Kaye are in my opinion the funniest comedians that I have have heard or seen. The Circus is up to Chaplin's standard.,1257724800,,143,4.538461538461538
479850,4,6302561825,"A lesser known Chaplin film, The Circus involves Chaplin's persona The Tramp joining a circus when, in an effort to escape police after inadvertently taking someone's money, he winds up entertaining an audience during a chase scene. The scene, which takes place within the film's first ten minutes, is one of the highlights, and we are treated to classic Chaplin, where he completely disrupts and ruins the magician's show, going in and out of loops to evade police. (There is also a scene prior to this where he hides in a room full of mirrors, and the police are bumbling around trying to nap him.) The crowd, who believes it is part of the gag, is rolling in laughter; afterwards, they are calling for ""the funny man"" to be part of the show. The tyrannical circus owner reluctantly hires him on, but gives him a lowly job so as he knows he's not the hit of the circus, and the Tramp is required to do all the menial jobs such as lugging around equipment. While out for a break, he meets the circus owner's daughter, who spies the Tramp's food and tries to eat because she is being denied food by her father. There is a touching scene where the Tramp acknowledges the poor girl's situation, and takes pity on her, offering her food behind her father's back. There is a bit of a conflict later in the film when a new tightrope walker is hired, and the Tramp, who begins to fall for the girl, sees that she is love with the new man. The Tramp tries several efforts to impress the girl, but eventually another bigger conflict happens later in the film which forces him to forget these plans and help the girl.

While The Circus is funny in its own right, it probably doesn't have the charm comparable to the likes of The Kid, Modern Times, or City Lights. Chaplin's character is perhaps a bit shrewder than in other films. Still, the Chaplin fan will love the gags and bits that he's able to pull off, and having the Tramp in a circus setting is a stroke of genius for comedy lovers. The Circus is a relatively short film (a little over one hour long), so it moves rather quickly and its plot is quite simple. Definitely worth a viewing!",1246320000,4,2136,4.435114503816794
479851,5,6302561825,"Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin made 'The Circus' in 1928 in not so happy circumstances. He was in the midst of a divorce and things were not going right for the production. In fact, the circus ring on the sets even caught fire resulting in time and production losses. Yet through all these trials and tribulations, Chaplin came out a winner. The film was given an academy award in 1929 - an award it richly deserves. The film is a masterpiece. The shot techniques, the story, the script and not to forget the music that Chaplin scored himself. The Merna Kennedy theme is beautiful on the violas and cellos with mandolin in the background. In the 1960s release, Chaplin even wrote and sung a song, ""Swing Little Girl."" I have watched this film after 81 years and still it could move me to tears. The final scene is unforgettable when the caravan moves on and the tramp sits lonely on a discarded circus trunk. Hats off to Chaplin! My eyes were wet when the film was through.",1233705600,,970,4.517045454545454
479871,4,6302561825,"One can argue that Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, and starred in greater films than his neglected 1928 gem, The Circus, his last fully silent film, which he also wrote with Joseph Plunkett, but one cannot reasonably argue that he made a funnier film; nor can one argue that The Circus is not a great film itself. Yet, critics, fans of Chaplin, and even Chaplin himself, long overlooked this great film. The reason has more to do with the highly publicized divorce trial from Lita Grey that Chaplin endured while filming the feature over two years, as well as a host of other production disasters. Chaplin was so paranoid he felt his wife would try to steal the film, so hid the negatives. The film was not even mentioned in Chaplin's autobiography, nor was it screened in the years after its release, until, in 1970, Chaplin rereleased it with a new score that he composed.
  As a Chaplin aficionado, I can state that no Chaplin film goes as long- 69 minutes, with such sustained laughter. There are more memorable gags in this one film than in any other film he made- or perhaps anyone has made since, and it deservedly won him his first Academy Award at the first ceremony in 1929. It was a special award for Versatility And Genius In Writing, Acting, Directing, And Producing. Obviously, these were the days before schlock like Crash, Brokeback Mountain, Monster, and Titanic were considered `great films,' worthy of such awards. Yet, even had Chaplin not buried the film in his vault for decades, the very fact that it was made between two of his greatest critical and financial successes, The Gold Rush and City Lights, two indisputable silent film era masterpieces, may have fated the film to its nearly forgotten status anyway.
  As pure comedy, perhaps the only film that has as ceaseless a run of comic gags that all work is the 1960s all-star comedy classic It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, but that film could lay no claim to great nor higher art. Perhaps the only downside to The Circus- or rather the DVD, is that it does not offer the original film from 1928, replete with a silent film organ score- say by the great silent organist Rosa Rio? Instead, we only have the overwrought, and didactic musical score Chaplin composed in 1970. His opening rendition of the saccharine Swing Little Girl, sung over the opening titles, is plain bad- both as music and as sung, but thankfully passes quickly. As with his unfortunate 1942 reissue of The Gold Rush- with added narration, this music guides the audience too much, although the film's main theme, I must admit, wins you over at the end. Fortunately, that film's DVD comes with both the 1942 reissue and the 1925 original- which is superior. Some artists never know when to leave greatness alone. Even so, The Circus is the purest and least flawed Chaplin feature film ever made, in that it distills every single aspect of his greatness and, yes, even that grossly overused term- genius. For anyone with a love of pure cinema, silent cinema, and its history, this film and DVD is a must to see and own. But, if you have heart problems, I advise you to be wary, because it is so funny it could literally hurt you....but wouldn't that be the best way to go?",1221696000,5,3219,4.6520210896309315
479872,5,6302561825,"This was the Chaplin film that almost didn't get made, and once it did get made, it still remained relatively obscure.  Chaplin was going through various crises in his personal life (a divorce, tax problems).  On top of that, there was lost footage (of the magnificent tightrope scene too!) that could not be re-duplicated.  Somehow Chaplin & Co. overcame the obstacles to create a durable--if somewhat neglected--comedy classic.

For sheer comedy, it's hard to think of too many Chaplin film bits that top his tightrope act or the accidental sabotage of the magician's routine.  Having the Little Tramp hook up with and play off of real circus clowns was a stroke of genius.  The Tramp is a clown who has no need of a costume, other than his usual comic attire.  He's funniest when he doesn't realize it.  And that, of course, is the point.  As in most Chaplin films, there are poignant moments as well, when he falls in love with a fetching young woman--in this case, the circus owner's abused acrobat daughter--who will never come to care for him in quite the same way.

One can speculate about how the typically ""Chaplinesque"" themes of being misunderstood, thwarted at every turn, and not fully appreciated interested reflected events in the filmmaker's own life.  It was certainly a difficult film to make, and a certain melancholy comes through despite the many yuks.  That's to be expected in a Chaplin film, of course, but THE CIRCUS seems especially whistful and the film's ending, with the Tramp's choosing to remain behind and to let the circus run away from HIM is haunting.",1203120000,,1587,4.837037037037037
479873,5,6302561825,"While perhaps not up to quite the same fine level as, say, 'City Lights' or 'Monsieur Verdoux,' this film is a small minor masterpiece in its own right, and frequently cited as Chaplin's most underrated film.  Viewing the film, it's hard to believe that the filming experience was such a nightmare, what with things like fires, heavy rains, theft, and Chaplin's messy divorce from his second wife.  Generally speaking, Chaplin's features seem to have a bit more drama than endless gags (not that that makes them any less powerful or classic), with the focus being on the narrative storyline and not just a series of funny incidents, but this film rather plays like one of his earlier short subjects, where the laughs were far more frequent.  The storyline is simple enough: The Tramp, on the run from the police yet again, even though he didn't really do anything that terribly wrong, eventually stumbles into a circus that's come to town.  He makes friends with the horribly mistreated daughter of the circus owner, and falls in love with her, but like in just about all of his films, this love too is unrequited.  The pretty bareback rider really loves Rex, the new tightrope walker.  While in the circus, Charlie has all sorts of comic misadventures, most famously in the scene where the monkeys are climbing all over him while he's on the tightrope after he's accidentally lost the hidden wire that was keeping him balanced.  After this latest mishap, it seems as though his future in the circus is over, though with the scheme he then hatches, things might not be so lost after all.

The extras on the bonus disc are plentiful--movie trailers, a poster and picture gallery, a delightful excerpt from the cute 1923 Jackie Coogan film 'Circus Days,' three brief home movies, a whole extra sequence (26 minutes in length) that was deleted from the final cut of the film, the usual introduction by David Robinson, the trailer for all of the films in the Chaplin Collection, and the featurette on the significance and influence of the film today, footage of the Hollywood premiere in January 1928, a brief film shot by Chaplin's chief cameraman Rollie Totheroh, of 3-D test footage, and simulatenous footage from two different cameras during a scene from the deleted sequence.  Unfortunately, none of these bonus films have any soundtracks, not even just some generic piano or organ accompaniment.  With all of the care that went into assembling the DVDs in the Chaplin Collection, one would think that the producers would have cared enough to have found soundtracks for all of these bonus short films on the discs.

Quite possibly his most underrated silent feature, if not his most underrated feature period, this film is just as wonderful as all of his other features and, due to how it often plays like one of his shorts from the Teens instead of his more serious features, it could very well be an ideal introduction to Chaplin for a new fan.",1166313600,8,2947,4.815841584158416
479874,5,6302561825,"The technical quality of the DVD is excellent.  My interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend's wall of Charlie Chaplin and an actor.  The actor, Hugh Sasson, was the Uncle of my friend's mother.  He appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked.  The photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet.  We set the photo on the TV and stepped through this scene on the DVD one frame at a time.  It gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time.

Additionally, the story of the production difficulties found on disk 2 are fascinating.",1159660800,2,692,4.119402985074627

479876,5,6302561825,"I enjoyed this a lot more the second time when I could see it on a very clear DVD print. I don't know why that would make a difference with the story, but it did as I found it very good for the entire distance, although that's just a scant 69 minutes.  The special two-disc edition does this film justice.

In the story, Charlie Chaplin does his normally-great physical slapstick so well that he accidentally becomes a hit at the circus, which is run by a nasty man (Allan Garcia) who regularly beats his sweet step-daughter, played by a very pretty Merna Kennedy. Charlie, of course, gets smitten by her and comes to her rescue.

This movie has a different kind of ending that what you'd normally see for a comedy but it's inspiring as Chaplin performs a noble deed.

Chaplin's timing and clever slapstick routines never fail to amaze me. Even though silent films aren't seen by many people these days, it's works of art like this that will endure forever. This is not of one of Chaplin's more famous movies.....but it should be. I think it's one of his best.",1146096000,11,1060,4.505208333333333
479877,4,6302561825,"The Circus is the story of a little tramp who stumbles upon a circus when he gets mixed up with the police. He becomes the hit of the show, so the boss hires him but does not let him know he is such a success so he does not have to pay him the proper amount. The lonely man befriends another outcast in the troupe, the boss's daughter. However, although the tramp obviously feels deeply for the girl, she marries a tightrope walker. A bittersweet scene at the end shows the tramp enthusiastically accompanying them on their wedding day.

However, the simple story really is not what is important. Really, the valuable part of The Circus are the comedic elements. There is an extremely cute and clever sequence in a fun house that Chaplin perfected. There is a running gag with an aggressive mule that is always funny. Even when the tramp is trying to be funny but the others do not think he is, he is funny! The comedy seems somehow different from Chaplin's normal strain, but it is very good nonetheless.

There are also some artistically shot dramatic scenes in the film, a staple of Charlie Chaplin's genius.

Chaplin wrote this music score, and as a result it is reminiscent of some of the scores he wrote for his other films, but it is highly effective in the various scenes.

This is one of the least known Chaplin films; it was made between The Gold Rush and City Lights, two highly successful and important films. Perhaps audiences thought this film paled in comparison, or perhaps it was overshadowed by the problems Chaplin was having with his wife at the time, Lita Grey. In fact, co-star Merna Kennedy was Grey's best friend.

A Day's Pleasure accompanies The Circus on this VHS. It was made in 1919, a film about a Model T Ford with an excellent bit aboard a ship.",1131062400,4,1777,4.5233644859813085
479878,5,6302561825,"I don't pretend to be an expert on Chaplin's history, but I do own the Chaplin Collection (both sets) and I have also seen other Chaplin shorts.

I read other reviews stating that this movie was mediocre...I strongly disagree.

This movie is just as funny as the other films. The main difference is that the story is not as complex as most of his other films.

Everyone talks about how wonderful the ending to City Lights was. I loved City Lights (especially the boxing scene) but I find the ending of The Circus a heck of a lot more moving than that of City Lights. As is the case with just about every other Chaplin film, the social commentary is evident, but the message at the end of The Circus will really hits home.

Again, I highly recommend this movie for a good laugh, which does NOT get boring toward the middle, and a very emotional ending.",1126656000,4,851,4.401273885350318
479879,4,6302561825,"A very entertaining and well made comedy.  The story is pretty simple with The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time taking a stage hand job at a circus where he unwittingly becomes the star of the show with his antics.  The best moments of the film are the expertly choreographed comic routines.  The climactic tightrope walk is a bit of a letdown next to the earlier, funnier bits (like the opening funhouse chase), but that is a small detraction.  The unrequited love story adds some much needed depth to the film, giving it that bittersweet quality that any good comedy needs to be effective.  Chaplin here gives us just a peak at that serious side of The Tramp that we would see more of in his last two films.  Beautiful ending.",1120521600,2,729,4.569230769230769

His last silent film focuses on the aspect of a clown's success and failure  a theme that worked to better advantage in ""Limelight."" There are several highlights, particularly the funhouse chase, yet the movie seems forced and a bit too melodramatic. No wonder Chaplin kept ""The Circus"" out of circulation for decades  he knew it was lacking.

479883,5,6302561825,"Of all the films I've watched of Charlie Chaplin this has got to be my most favorite comedy of his and definitly needs to be saved from obscurity . It's both a drama and comedy and has lots of pantomime and slapstick . The story goes like this , Charlie goes to the circus and is mistaken for a pickpocket . He tries to escape from the police by entering a mirror maze ( I wonder how Charlie pulled off this camera trick ) and pretends to be one of those mechanical dummies . He then gets chased into the big top where he causes a roar of laughter to the audience that has been bored out by the ringmasters so called entertainment . The ringmaster soon realizes that this tramp character is what he needs for his circus so he gives him a trial and lets Charlie show off his funny`material which to the ringmaster is not funny. The only time the tramp is funny is when he tries not to be so the ring master hires Charlie to be a property with pretty good results . The tramp falls in love with the ringmaster's abused step daughter . Merna( the ringmaster's stepdaughter ) soon finds love with the circus's new attraction Rex the "" King of Air "" a.k.a. tightrope walker . The movie is very funny and is filled with gags such as Charlie on the tightrope being harrassed by monkeys pulling his pants down , biting his nose , and sticking their tails in his mouth . What's really interesting about this scene is that when you look at the expression on his face it's pretty sad , its charlie struggling through his perosonal life . He can't escape from all this trouble just like he couldn't escape from his divorce with his second wife Lita grey , his money problems , his mother's death and problems with stage fires all during the making of this film . The last scene in the film just wants to make you burst into tears because the tramp finds out that the girl is in love with the tightrope walker so he gets them married because he knows that he could never have a chance with Merna and the circus leaves leaving Charlie behind. Truly one of Chaplin's  most hard to make films that should be more mentioned about . The short comedy included in this video sucks though .",1079913600,4,2169,4.2773722627737225

TRANSFER: Warner/MK2 give us a beautifully rendered B&W picture that, although showing signs of age related wear and tear, nevertheless enthralls in each and every frame. Film grain is kept to a minimum. Blacks - for the most part, are deep and solid. The gray scale is nicely balanced. Occasionally there is some aliasing but it is minute and unobtrusive. The audio, as with all Chaplin movies, has been remastered to 5.1 with a nice spread across all 5 channels.
Extras:a documentary, deleted sequence, outtakes, three home movies, excerpts from ""Circus Day"" with Jackie Coogan, a photo gallery, film posters and trailers.

479886,5,6302561825,"For my 'non-Chaplin' friends, I usually show this first (as another reviewer has said) and they soon become converts.
As far as I remember (and it's been at least five years since I've ready any Chaplin bios) this film was made during one of Chaplin's hardest personal periods. I believe he was in the midst of a divorce by his third wife, Lita Grey, in which their dirty laundry was dragged into public...a prolonged, grey period ensued, which turned poor Charles' hair more white than ever.
To top it off, I remember reading that this set burned down, not once, but twice, during the filming...then it's no wonder that Chaplin, perfectionist that he was, would decry this as his 'poorest' film.
I couldn't agree less.
The physical gags abound, with the little Tramp making his way to 'stardom' via pure accident...he enlivens a circus show with his cheekiness, accidentally stumbling and bobbing his way onto the boring 'clown show'...he subsequently joins the circus, taking a fancy to a poor overworked girl who is starved by her father, the circus-master, and doing everything he can to show that he loves her...
the tight-rope scenes are gut-splitting, from the beginning when he tries to convince her that he is *really* ok to do it, resulting in much hypermachinations when his rigged bodysuit touches an electrical livewire, to his real tribulations when he is up in the air, 'befriended' by some savage monkeys who like to bite his nose and tear his pants down...some of the most supremely comic moments on film are captured here...words don't do them justice...more than any other Chaplin film (and I've seen all the major ones), this one has real heart and poignance to match 'City Lights'...the ending, with Chaplin giving up the girl, has no match. The little Tramp sits, sun coming up on a glorious LA morning, and watches as the caravan rolls on without him...in the dusky, pale shadows of dawn...then, in little Tramp fashion, he gets up and wanders toward that dusky sunrise...it's a truly sad, yet uplifting, moment...on an additional note, Chaplin did the score himself (in perfectionist manner) and it fits the movie beautifully...no score of a silent (if one actually exists) does more justice to the mood of a film...
a GREAT movie...no one does it better!",1039392000,6,2279,4.9067357512953365

Anyway, alot of truth is shown in this movie, like when Chaplin is funny accidently as well as purposely. The donkey and the lion add humor to the film, as well as the horse and the pill. Chaplin does something most people wouldn't in this film, and that would be marry off the girl he loves to someone else because their in love. He works in the circus for awhile but then he believes he must go back to his tramp life. This is a funny side of Chaplin that classic movie likers will enjoy.",1028851200,3,577,4.254545454545455
479888,5,6302561825,"Both ""The Gold Rush"" and ""City Lights"" are accepted as ciname classics, classic comedy films made by Chalrie Chaplin. In between is a much less known work, ""The Circus"".
""The Circus"" is less well known because the film was not available from shortly after completing it's first release in 1928 until the early 70's, when it was finally re-released. It's re-release brought it to a new audience, who had some knowledge of the film, but not enough to truly value it.
The plot is rather simple - Chaplin's Tramp character stumbles into a failing circus, and is chased by police into the big top, where his chase is the funniest thing to have happened during the whole show. The Tramp is hired at the circus, who's cruel director doesn't let him know how popular he is. The director is generally cruel, abusing his daughter, yelling at everyone, and being generally mean. The girl is in love with a tightrope artist, the Tramp falls in love with the girl, and the film ends with the gril married to the tightrope artist and the Tramp staying behind.
The plot is fleshed out by some of the funniest screen moments that Chaplin would ever come up with. He tries to be a tightrope walker. He gets caught in a funhouse with a crook who is trying to steal from him and a police officer who thinks that he is the real crook. He breaks up a magicians act in the middle of the big top. He gets stuck in a cage with a lion.
Okay, I'm not doing ANY justice to this great film. My review is not funny - the film is.
The film was meticulously restored by David Shepherd, and was released in 1999 on DVD. This DVD is now out of print, and a new on will be issued next year, though likely without the corrections and restorations by Shepherd. This is a shame, since the 1999 DVD includes outtakes and a properly restored opening. The quality is superb, and there are few hints as to the film's age.

479890,5,6302561825,"It doesn't have the raw sentiment of CITY LIGHTS or the social relevance of either MODERN TIMES or THE GREAT DICTATOR, but for pure laugh-out-loud moments, THE CIRCUS is probably Chaplin's finest straight-ahead comedy.
The plot is fairly straightforward -- Tramp joins circus, falls in love, tries to vanquish a rival suitor, then (in an ending of typical Chaplinian pathos) arranges for the rival suitor to get the girl.  However, Chaplin packs the story with enough gags, extended jokes, and visual tricks to keep the film moving at a frenetic pace, even in its moments of sweetness.
The setting of the circus naturally lends itself to plenty of comic elements, and Chaplin makes the most of them in some unexpected ways.  For example, there's the expected Locked In The Cage with The Sleeping Lion joke (which has subsequently and successfully been played to the hilt in Bugs Bunny cartoons), but Chaplin gives it a graceful twist with the addition of a pan of water that'll have you on the edge of your seat as he tries frantically not to drop it.
But Chaplin doesn't just use the circus to showcase gags -- he also uses the trappings to advance some extended and complicated jokes.  The opening moments of the film, for example, feature the Tramp being mistaken for a pickpocket.  After a full-out chase, the Tramp, the real pickpocket, and a policeman finally end up in a funhouse, complete with animated figures and a hall of mirrors.  At this point, there are two wonderful visual jokes -- the first involves the Tramp's inability to pick up a dropped hat in a hall of mirrors(in what must have been an excrutiatingly technical shot to avoid reflecting the camera.)  Chaplin, ever the perfectionist, executes the scene brilliantly.  The second joke -- and the one which gets the biggest belly laughs -- involves the Tramp and the hapless pickpocket pretending to be animated figures to avoid being nabbed by the policeman.  When Chaplin conks the crook over the head with his own cosh, then rotates mechanically to laugh giddily . . . well, there's hardly a funnier moment in film.  Suffice it to say, the crook is caught, but only after ten minutes of gags to neatly bring the extended Mistaken Identity Joke to a neat end.
Chaplin also plays out a jaw-dropping tightrope walking scene (and remember while watching that Chaplin actually taught himself to walk a tightrope for the film -- there are no stuntmen involved) which becomes all the more entertaining through the addition of some uncooperative monkeys.  The impromptu results are funnier than anyone could have scripted.
While the film stays free of social commentary, there is one telling bit of artistic elbow-nudging at one point in the film, when the Tramp, who has been hired as a clown, is lectured by the crabby Ringmaster on How To Be Funny.  When the Tramp participates in the hackneyed skits himself, things go wrong from the start, making the skits funnier than imagined, but remarkably UNfunny to the know-it-all Ringmaster.  The message is a subtle, but clear one on Chaplin's part -- don't tell ME what's funny; let me show YOU what's funny.
While MODERN TIMES and CITY LIGHTS are the more effective films in terms of storytelling and blending humor and pathos, THE CIRCUS stands as Chaplin's funniest film in terms of successfully executed gags, jaw dropping visuals (including a remarkably advanced dream sequence), and some fall-over-laughing moments. This is the film I show to my friends who have never seen a Chaplin film (apart from some highlighted moments from MODERN TIMES or CITY LIGHTS) to give them an idea of Chaplin's talent.  While it has sometimes (though rarely) failed to elicit a ""Wow!"", it has never failed to generate a room full of laughter -- the true testimony to Chaplin's art.",975628800,33,3785,4.876947040498442
