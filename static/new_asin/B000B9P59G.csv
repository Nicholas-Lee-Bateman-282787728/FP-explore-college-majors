8083896,5,B000B9P59G,"The great french comedian Louis De Funes is very funny in this comedy.

He plays the restaurant inspector Mr. Duchemin, who issues a guide with quality ratings of restaurants. Because the inspector has strict stanards, a lot of restauant owners become his enemies. He trains his son to be an inspector as well, but the son rather prefers to be a comedian in a circus. After inspecting a few restaurants (french quisine, american quisine, etc.), he gets to face the producer of canned food - Mr. Trikatel. Tricatel wants to destroy him, because Duchemin can reveal the fact that canned food has poor quality. Duchemin manages to penetrate into Trikatel's factory and to observe the horrifying methods that are used for production of artificial foods.

Then there is a TV battle between Duchemin and Trikatel, and of course Duchemin wins, but only because he gets help from his son.

This is a remarkable story that will make you question the quality of the food that you eat.

For me, this film was definitely worth watching and it made me laugh because of its sophisticated humor.",1164412800,8,1080,4.821621621621621
