This fascinating film explores the dynamics of the encounter group, a then-popular method of delving into one's own psyche & one's relationships with others ... and also the ways in which an emotionally troubled but dangerous individual could threaten the group. It's really a microcosm of society at the time and as such provides an on-the-spot window into what now must seem like a very foreign world indeed.

But all that aside, it's also a strong story, with interesting characters whose lives have reached various breaking points. For that alone it's worth watching, as what begins as an earnest psychological exercise gradually turns ugly & menacing, but also revelatory. The encounter group was like many other things in life: it could easily become a two-edged sword. Yet it could also reveal a great many personal truths for those willing to take the risk.

I'm especially impressed with both the writing & the acting, raw & edgy not only for network TV circa 1971, but for today as well. At times I forgot these were actors, because it seems so spontaneous & genuine -- a young Dorothy Lyman is a real standout. And there are no magic, easy answers at the end; their problems aren't wrapped up neatly for a tidy, unrealistic conclusion.  This could easily work as a stage play, and it would be a good one!

You may have to make a couple of mental adjustments to get into the 1970s worldview, but that's partly the pleasure & point of an older film like this, after all -- highly recommended!",1327190400,,1570,4.73992673992674
