8244418,4,B00127R2T2,"With this volume Negima! finally gets somewhat back on track after a very lackluster third volume.  While these are primarally just more standalone episodes, they at least return to the overriding harem theme of a class of girls all crazy for some reason about their ten-year-old teacher.  In about the very first episode, it was established that the man-shy and reclusive Nodoka has probably the strongest real romantic feelings for Negi, but those have been pretty much pushed aside by subsequent happenings.  They are finally allowed to return in this set of episodes, when a silly ""game"" to see who can be the first to find and kiss Negi in what is basically a version of the traditional Japanese ""haunted school"" combines with her friend Yue's encouragement and assistance.

There are a few moments within the overall silliness of most of these four episodes that allow for decent character development or revelation, notably between Asuna and Ayaka the Class Rep, and both Nodoka and Yui.  It seems Yui may herself harbor some repressed feelings for Negi as well; if this leads to any conflict between the friends later remains to be seen. The highlight of this set is the trip to the amusement park where ( with a little help and encouragement from both her possible ""rivals"", Yui and Asuna ) Nodoka finally has her moment to ""declare"" to Negi.  If so far none of this has really interested you, it unfortunately won't be enough for more than the most lukewarm recommendation of Negima!",1268524800,,1493,4.858267716535433
