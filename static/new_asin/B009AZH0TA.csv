5311987,1,B009AZH0TA,Wow... This movie was a rotten tomato.  Horrible...Horrible...Didn't the actors realize when they read the script that it was a dude?  Not much can be said on the positive side.,1370131200,2,177,4.866666666666666
5311988,1,B009AZH0TA,"I have seen many low-budget, independent films. As long as the acting and the story line are good, I can enjoy them. That was not the case for Forbidden Woman.  The story was all over the place, the acting was horrible (even though the cast included a few very experienced actors), and the so-called funny moments were borderline slapstick. This movie was so bad that I could not finish watching it. I want my money back!",1366416000,4,421,4.5394736842105265

8538951,1,B009AZH0TA,THe fade to gray slo mo scenes--the lead actor singing this terrible song at the end. I can't decide what was the most terrible parts. A few preachy scenes thrown in the mess so maybe church groups will watch it. I would not show this at my church. And there is some talented actors here--they just had a terrible script.  I didn't find anyone likeable except maybe the kid sister. The comedy was really forced and over acted.,1400457600,,426,4.461538461538462

8538954,5,B009AZH0TA,"They should have named this Low Down and Durty Woman cause she was just corrupt, sneaky and conniving.  It has some comedy too",1381968000,,126,4.478260869565218
8538955,5,B009AZH0TA,I did not think I would like this movie but to my surprise I really enjoyed it.  You should buy this movie.,1375142400,,107,3.8636363636363638
8538956,5,B009AZH0TA,"We enjoyed the movie. yes its slow pace but that is how its supposed to be. We want everything microwave but if we take time to look at the movie, each scene builds upon the next and there is so much to learn from this movie. We plan to show it to our teens at church so they can learn about relationship and how to deal with the issues presented in this movie. The acting was great because you can see ""Jezebel"" in action and learn how to deal with that type of person. You can also see a young man who was once confidence in how to deal with a lady evolve and a woman who was hurt when she was young and how that impacted her adult hood. It took prayer and the Lord to change each of these lives and that was awesome in itself.

The acting in my opinion was great. No. It's NOT a Tyler Perry movie and it wasn't suppose to be. Its more of a satire but the story line is so rich. When you watch it, see what you can gain from it. I don't believe it was just to entertain. It was full of meaning.

I have already recommended it and I'll recommend it again. I thought the actors portrayed their roles very well and I could follow the story through.",1374796800,,1147,3.982608695652174
