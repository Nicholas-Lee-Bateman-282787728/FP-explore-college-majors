8420931,4,B004AUP3S0,I love this serie. It's about a comedy about marriage. Young couple vs old couples in marriage. Not perfect but worth watch it. Hope that they get the second season on DVD and bluray.,1486080000,,183,4.411764705882353
8420932,5,B004AUP3S0,"A great Sitcom about two teenagers getting married at age 18.  Their living at home and the quirky parents and friends made the show work.  Too bad that the plug was pulled after Season 2.  While not believable, it was definitely an entertaining and lighthearted comedy.  Stacy Farber and Michael Seater are both talented actors and did a great job.  I was surprised to see that the credits show the series stars Stacy Farber, and that Michael Seater is listed near the end of the credits in a supporting role.  I'm sure anyone would agree that Stacy and Michael were the stars of the show.  Would definitely liked to have seen more seasons, but at least it's available via Amazon.",1388275200,3,681,4.625
8420933,2,B004AUP3S0,"I heard from several friends that this was one of those shows that should be checked out. I didn't necessarily think it would be an Emmy-worthy comedy, but maybe something of a guilty pleasure. Admittedly, I was intrigued after I found out Stacey Farber was the lead, and I'd be lying if I said Degrassi isn't a major guilty pleasure of mine (at least the first few seasons; I can't speak on what it has become). Alas, I gave this several solid efforts, and it just didn't do it for me. There was just something off tonally with the series. So many of the jokes that should have produced genuine laughs (or, at the very least, chuckles) missed, and missed badly. The camera would stay close on someone's face after their joke, as if to ask, ""Are you laughing yet?"" I think both Farber and Michael Seater are undeniably talented. But the writing lets them down time after time, and I'm anxious to see them in shows or films that complement their skills more appropriately.",1363305600,,971,4.554285714285714

8420935,4,B004AUP3S0,"I really like this adorable little show about a pair of 18-year-olds - Tom and Jessie - who get married. After all, they've been best friends forever, and they're next-door neighbors. And, they really are in love.

Of course, they're completely at a loss as to how to actually be married. They live in the attic of his parents' house, and get into fights because they're so young and have no idea how to be married. And of course, everyone tells them they're crazy for getting hitched.

Besides Tom and Jessie, who really ARE adorable, the other characters are fun as well.  Tom's parents: uptight, thinks things should be a certain way; after all, his dad is a judge.  Jessie's parents: hippy free-thinkers who aren't actually married. Their best friends, Ava and Carter.  Tom's older and younger siblings. And ""the refugee"", who lives with Jessie's parents, but we never actually learn his name or where he's fled from.

Yes, the show's a bit ""Dharma & Greg"", but it's also darling and fun, and I'm soooo bummed they canceled it after just 2 seasons. There was so much more to explore in the characters' lives.  4.5 stars.",1339891200,4,1124,4.704081632653061
