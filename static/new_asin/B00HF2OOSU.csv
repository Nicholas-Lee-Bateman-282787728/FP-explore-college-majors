8632183,5,B00HF2OOSU,"This is an EXCELLENT tour of Savannah's squares and other historic areas.  It is well narrated and beautifully filmed, full of Savannah history and tidbits known by locals.  It is so full of information, that I needed to view it several times.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone planning a visit to Savannah or anyone who loves Savannah and just wants to brush up on their history and live the beauty of the city from afar.",1528761600,,427,4.51948051948052
