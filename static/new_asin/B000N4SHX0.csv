2755975,5,B000N4SHX0,These two highly underrated Wayne films are spectacular. His early work is mostly forgotten and it shouldn't be that way. Excellent films and I recommend them to anyone and everyone.,1391904000,,182,5.1
2755976,5,B000N4SHX0,"This was a gift for my husband for Christmas. He loves John Waynes movies, and will watch them over and over again. He does own most of them. I enjoy watching them with him too.",1370736000,,177,4.085714285714285
2755977,4,B000N4SHX0,The quality of the CD was good. The movies played well & the 2 stories put across their point very cleaverly.,1362873600,,109,4.238095238095238
2755978,5,B000N4SHX0,2 John Wayne movies for the price of one. John Wayne does not disappoint in either of them Good movies well written script,1354492800,,122,4.3478260869565215
2755979,4,B000N4SHX0,As with most every thing John Wayne did these are both workman like and typical movies. These are two more of the B movies the Duke did while learning how to really act the macho he man.,1315785600,,186,4.054054054054054
2755980,4,B000N4SHX0,"These are two nice old John Wayne movies.  They definitely are way better than his old ""B"" movie days.  They are very enjoyable movies, and definitely worth seeing!",1274918400,,164,4.821428571428571
2755981,5,B000N4SHX0,This is an exceptional product. I am very pleased with it and will be looking for some other titles as it pertains to John Wayne,1207180800,,128,4.16
2755982,4,B000N4SHX0,"Yep, Wayne starts out in both these Republic offerings in a tophat! But, he soon trades them in for more conventional western wear. The DVD is a good quality transfer, with maybe just a momentary sound skip or two in each. No extras in the ""Dakota"" DVD, but a reading commentary included in the ""In Old California ""DVD.
  In the latter film, Wayne, an easterner pharmacist, arrives in a primitive Sacramento, just before the Gold Rush.(The fact that Sacramento didn't exist, except in the form of Sutter's Fort, before the Gold Rush, seems not to have bothered the script editor).  He chose this script because his father was a pharmacist. Wayne immediately gets on the bad side of the ""boss"" of Sacramento, Britt Dawson, by carrying his longtime girlfriend across a muddy street, despite her initial protests.  By the end of this event, we are pretty sure who she will eventually end up with. Wayne proceeds to become an ever  bigger thorn in Dawson's side and they have occasional altercations. Meanwhile, Wayne and a prim young society lady become engaged for marriage. Lacey keeps dropping hints that she might dump Dawson for Wayne, but the Duke plays dumb, as he doesn't want to further antagonize Dawson.  The story starts getting very fanciful when Wayne is saved from a hanging by a loudmouth who yells ""gold"".  Disgusted with both Dawson and Wayne, Lacey leaves and ends up in a gold camp with a typhoid epidemic. Wayne incredibly convinces fleeing prospectors to turn around and take his medicines to the gold fields(How many wagons does it take to transport a few boxes of medicines?!). Dawson's gang ambushes the wagon train to trade medicines for gold in the miner camps.(The fact that there were no useful medicines or vaccines for typhoid until the 20th century seems to have escaped the attention of the script editor).
  You can check out the film to see the details of how you know things are going to eventually turn out. The problematic developing relationship between Wayne's sidekick,Edgar Kennedy, and Lacey's maid,Patsy Kelly, while humorous at times, is merely distracting at other times. According to the production notes, ""The Spoilers"", which was made at nearly the same time, has a basically similar plot, involving a gold rush and Wayne caught between a heartless society lady and a dancehall girl with a heart of gold. This is a much better known film, made by another studio, with
Wayne getting only third billing!
  In ""Dakota"", many reviewers complain about Vera Ralston's acting. I thought this failed ice skating queen did an OK job playing her role. She is supposed to be the elegant daughter of an immigrant father who struck it rich in railroads. This explains her foreign accent and the fact that she is not like the sexy dancehall girls of Fargo. She is determined to call the shots when it comes to deciding where they will live, both near the beginning  and at the end of the film. When they run away from her disapproving father, Wayne tells her to buy tickets for CA, but she buys tickets for St. Paul. She knows her father's railroad is soon planning to build an extention to Fargo. She hopes to buy land from the farmers cheap and sell it to her father's railroad expensive. The trouble is Ward Bond and gang have the same idea. Bond assumes the railroad is coming to Fargo because he saw their surveyors. He also assumes that Wayne is a land buying agent for the railroad. Bond hammers out a contract with  most of the farmers whereby he gets their land if they can't repay his loan to help harvest and market their crops. He plans to burn their crop, a variation of a similar scene in ""The Westerner"", where the cattlemen are trying to burn out the sod busters. But, Wayne threatens to pressure the railroad to build to Grand Fork rather than Fargo, unless Bond signs over this contract with the farmers to Wayne(and thus presumably the railroad) for a big discount compared to what Bond was planning to sell the contract to the railroad for. Wayne then plans to share the profit with the farmers. But Bond hopes to steal this contract back from a deceased Wayne and delete the bit about Wayne being the new owner of the  contract. Bond then burns the wheat crop. See the movie to find out how things turn out.
  Walter Brennan plays a goofy old riverboat captain who mostly talks to his boat or himself or shouts at his assistant, Nichodemis. Nick Stewart, as Nickodemis, plays his stock character: a sleepy very slow witted ""darkie"". He was Lightnin' in the ""Amos and Andy"" TV series.",1189036800,2,4536,4.722784810126583
2755983,4,B000N4SHX0,"As I have said before, two movies for the price of one is always a good deal.  These are two from Wayne's day at Republic Studios.  While these do not rank with the Duke's best work they are  action filled with good plots and some humor too.  John Wayne plays a pharmacist in the selection ""In Old California"".  This is a little different from the roles he normally played, but he wanted this because his father had been a pharmacist.  Wayne saves the day as villians steal prospectors' gold and battles a disease outbreak as well.  ""Dakota"" pairs him with Vera Ralston as his wife.  Look for Walter Brennan and Ward Bond in this one also.  It is the story of settlers fighting the bad guys over the passage of railraod tracks.",1173744000,3,727,4.446969696969697
