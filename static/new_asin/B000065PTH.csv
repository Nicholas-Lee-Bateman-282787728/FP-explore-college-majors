8339679,5,B000065PTH,"When Nisha Ganatra went to make this film, she had another actress in mind to play the lesbian sister to the newly married, and subsequently barren, older Indian-American woman. When her choice for the actress to play the lesbian sister bowed out at the last moment, Nisha stepped into the role as well as being director and writer. Her character decides to be a surrogate parent for her sister much to the dismay of her girlfriend played by Jill Hennessy of Law & Order and Crossing Jordan. I found this film to be funny and witty, especially when she was shooting on a tight budget. I would recommend this film highly.",1125532800,,620,4.594594594594595
8339680,2,B000065PTH,"This DVD - much as I wanted to like it - turns out to have the lack of camera-ability and depth of Go Fish (which might be excused as an art-film type deal), with a topic more like Bend it Like Beckahm (without the funnier bits, the depth of characrer, and the multi-dimensional plot).
Seriously - the plot doesn't flow, it jerks along in half-hearted jumps. The characters are incredibly one-dimensional. The actresses are, for the most part, not at all wonderful. They look like they're in drama school - trying way too hard with their voices, which gives a whiney tone, and not at all with body language, which leaves the viewer in turns exasperated and blankly looking at the screen.
Furthermore. the lesbian relationship portrayed (which would be the only reason to see the movie) has NO depth whatsoever. They barely touch, they don't kiss - the viewer only knows that they're more than friends because they make a point of saying so. And, frankly, if my girlfriend offered to carry someone else's baby, without consulting me or even asking my opinion, and the only reason she gave was 'She's my sister! *whine*!, I'd be more than slightly pissed. Sister or not.
Sadly enough, the reason I give this movie 2 stars is because 1) it at least attempts to cover some lesbian issues (though it pretty much fails), 2) some of the actors/actresses are at least tolerable, and, most importantly (and depressingly) 3) it actually compares favorably with other lesbian-themed movies (The Truth about Jane, for example - to be avoided at all costs). It can't be THAT hard to get half-decent acting and decent camera angels - look at Better Than Chocolate. Despite a shuddering plot, that movie was actually quite decent. How the hell can this one go so wrong???
If you want decent lesbian-themed movies, try (as mentioned above) Better than Chocolate, or But I'm a Cheerleader if you want a laugh. Best rent the last, though - it's a one-watch type deal.
And, as for this one, if you really want to watch it, just rent, borrow, or buy it used and re-sell it. I'd be VERY surprised if anyone could watch it more than once.",1083628800,,2116,4.6756032171581765
