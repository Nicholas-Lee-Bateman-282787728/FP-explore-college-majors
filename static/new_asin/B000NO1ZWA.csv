8325507,1,B000NO1ZWA,This video was simply substandard. It did not give any specific information for training a Doberman Pinscher. The basic information that was given could have been applied to almost any dog and would have be common knowledge to any average eight grade student. This video was a great disappointment. One star is a very generous rating for this item.,1383523200,,348,4.915254237288136
8325508,1,B000NO1ZWA,"This was a HUGE waste of $25.  We were looking for something that would prepare us for bringing a Doberman into our home, but this DVD was not the answer!  It gives some very very basic tips on grooming, etc., but if you know anything at all about raising a dog, it is USELESS!!  Not to mention, throughout the entirety of the presentation a terribly annoying soundtrack is being played at an ANNOYINGLY high volume.  Actually, the only redeeming quality of this DVD (the reason for it getting atleast ONE STAR) is the short bonus feature on Basic Obedience.  If you are looking for something that will educate you and prepare you for life with a Doberman (from a puppy to an adult dog), DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!",1184284800,16,708,4.457364341085271
