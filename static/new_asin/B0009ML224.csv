8063296,5,B0009ML224,These documentaries are well worth your time.  I feel that Robert Lairdon did an exceptional job digging up what he could of those people that set a standard before us like Paul and his apostles.  It is amazing to watch some of these clips from their healing ministries or revivals from the 50's and 60's and even before.,1275782400,6,321,4.517241379310345

Roberts Lairdon has included home movies of Smith Wigglesworth, Aimee Simple McPherson, etc.  Some of this information would be lost if it were not for these dvds.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.",1273104000,8,287,4.9375

but it did have some good info. which gives it 2 stars.",1143158400,36,361,4.46969696969697
