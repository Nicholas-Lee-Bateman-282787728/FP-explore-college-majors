8559850,5,B00AZNCDRU,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.  The theme of this event was that outside of the P.W.G. Championship match, the rest of the card (including the special stipulation to the title match) was a complete mystery to the crowd throughout the night except for one other attraction to the card which I'll get to later.

Steen defended the P.W.G. Championship against the man who stole the belt from him months earlier in ""Battle From Los Angeles"" winner Adam Cole in what was revealed to be a Guerrera Warfare match that saw brawling on the floor with Steen punishing Cole on each side of the ring along with various weapons like trash cans, chairs, ladders, thumbtacks, and the most hellacious steel chair structure you've ever seen.  Outside of the main event, the other attraction for this event was the farewell to Joey Ryan against his fellow Dynasty tag team partner Scorpio Sky that was full of emotions from the pre-match hug throughout the match to the speech afterwords.  Roderick Strong & Eddie Edwards debuted as a tag team (later known as the Dojo Boys) against Young Bucks where there were so many non-stop kicks that it could have been a drinking game, Super Smash Brothers defended the Tag Team Titles against the new RockNES Monsters in a match that didn't have the video game references as RockNES were working a heel style, and the winners of both matches pulling double duty against each other later in the night.  Other matches include Sami Calliham vs. Drake Younger in what would be the beginning of their ""best of three"" match series that was so intense & impactful from the start that even Kevin Steen on commentary said ""Let This Be Over"" at one point, El Generico vs. Rick Swann, and a four way match between B-Boy vs. Brian Cage vs. Willie Mack vs. T.J. Perkins that saw a bunch of interaction between three to all four men at one time at various points.

This was one of the strongest single P.W.G. shows in the past two years I've start watching this company so I would definitely go out of my way to view this event.",1365379200,,2344,4.761083743842365
