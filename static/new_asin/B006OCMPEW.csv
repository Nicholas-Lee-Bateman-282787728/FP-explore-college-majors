8501826,5,B006OCMPEW,Love the dvd viewing options! Students loved interactive portion!,1441584000,,65,6.333333333333333
8501827,1,B006OCMPEW,Not worth time or money.  Ten minutes long or less and so basic it is unhelpful.,1413417600,,80,4.0
8501828,4,B006OCMPEW,I'm an Elementary School Counselor and I purchased this to use with my second grade classes as part of a bullying lesson.  This is a good instructional tool for the primary grades.  I probably wouldn't use this DVD past the primary grades maybe you can use it in third grade as well but beyond that I think the intermediate students would find the DVD too childish and the lesson would be too basic for them.  I gave it four stars because they could have elaborated more on strategies kids can use to help stop bullying in the DVD.  I just pause the DVD and go over ideas with the Kids but placing it right in the DVD would have been simple for the makers to do.,1396224000,,662,4.23015873015873

8501830,5,B006OCMPEW,This is a great movie that all ages can enjoy.  Kids can be so cruel to one another so its nice to see a movie that sends the right message.  This is also a great movie that can be shown at school that actually has a valuable message. I highly recommend it!!!,1330473600,2,259,3.9615384615384617
8501831,5,B006OCMPEW,Stand Up To Bullying DVD is a great interactive DVD for young children. My 4 and 6 year old enjoyed it and have asked to watch it many times. My 6 year old even shared it with her 1st grade class. They liked the interactive nature of it as well as the fun characters. Great for preschool through probably 3rd grade.,1327622400,2,315,4.180327868852459
8501832,5,B006OCMPEW,"This DVD is a must have for all parents with younger children. Some kids don't understand that bullying is more than just taking someone's lunch money, and this video helps stop bullying before it gets to be a problem. By being interactive and featuring Daren the Lion, this video makes it fun for kids to learn about something so important. Hats off to LuckyKatTV.com and D.A.R.E for fighting the war on bullying!",1326672000,4,414,4.763888888888889

8501835,5,B006OCMPEW,"What a cool learning tool...love the interactive. With these characters, and Daren from DARE as a prudent teacher, they could touch on so many subjects like Internet Etiquette,Racism, coorprate greed? ..""maybe not""..but what a great format to teach and to learn from. To the Lucky Kat and Dare people...I think you have a great thing going here...keep it up.",1326153600,5,358,5.084745762711864
