8483686,4,B005QRONIW,"According to the Hammer filmography, Jack of Diamonds is a Hammer film from 1949. This film is a cheaply made flick about a down and out yacht owner that needs money, so he decides to rent out his yacht to treasure hunters. Basically, the yacht captain has some back stabbing ideas to get the treasure for himself. The reason I say this film was a cheap film is because Vernon Sewell which was the director of this film used his own yacht for this film as well as several others as a film location.",1363564800,2,498,4.308510638297872
