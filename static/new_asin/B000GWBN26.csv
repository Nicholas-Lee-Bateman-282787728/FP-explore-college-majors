8134851,3,B000GWBN26,"Scotty is a great player but unfortunately, he's not a very good teacher.  You can learn some good stuff from this video it you know how to absorb it between watching the video and deciphering the accompanying book.  Scotty says right in the video that he doesn't know much about theory, at least he's forthright about it.  It's too bad, too because he could be so much more if he did understand the theory behind what he is doing.",1416096000,,431,4.430379746835443
8134852,5,B000GWBN26,"When I watch this DVD as I have a dozen or so times, I imagine walking into a guitar center and hearing some guy in the corner playing this stuff. I'd faint. It's a shock sorta, how good he is. I find the DVD , if nothing else, and it is far from nothing else, very entertaining. Instruction-wise, I, unlike other posters here, found the tab useful. Maybe not perfect, but useful. The real issue is, aside from comparing yourself to Scotty, can you afford to convert your nails to this style? Brent Mason also uses fake nails and a thumb pick--it's the only way to even attempt this style, which is sorta like classical in it's multi-string approach, or, it's a polyfonic approach, even for lead lines. Scotty ain't the best teacher, for sure. But he may be in the top 5 or 10 best guitarists around the planet now.",1330905600,2,815,4.403973509933775
8134853,3,B000GWBN26,"I just got back from seeing Scotty Anderson perform live in Southern Indiana, and it was an unbelieveable show... what a fine man and an amazing musician. Talent like his does not come along every day. Scotty's playing is utterly unique, no one else can play what he routinely does on his Telecaster. The video is great for listening to and seeing him in action, but do not expect to pick much up. As is typical for so many Hotlicks products, the all-important details of Anderson's mind-boggling technique and style are glossed over. No RH or LH-fingerings, and the transcription book is not at all accurate (in fairness, whoever tried to transcribe Scotty earned his pay, it can't have been easy). With a player of this caliber, with such an intricate and sophisticated style, leaving details out means not getting it. Too bad the producers - Arlen Roth et al. - didn't try harder to pin his playing down.",1281484800,5,907,4.710691823899371
8134854,3,B000GWBN26,"Like the others before me I agree Scotty Andersons playing is beyond compare.
First though ,you should know the tab book that comes with it is so full of mistakes,
it is useless. Throw it out. It will only take what is already difficult and make it impossible.
 A discussion  of the type of intervals making up these runs would have been helpful.
The only way I can see to prosper from this is to flood my ears with Scottys sound and slowly back
engineer his runs one brick at a time.",1266796800,,484,4.25
8134855,2,B000GWBN26,"You can usually tell how a Hot Licks video is going to go by one of two things: the first thing the host says when the camera is on them, and if they ever say things like 'I don't know what note this is--I just know it sounds good'.

Scotty is a great player; no doubt about it. But he's not a great instructor. The production of this video is the most bare-bones of any HL video yet. It looks like they just grabbed Scotty on his way to a session and said ""Hey, here's $1000... just play guitar in front of the camera for the next hour"".

Yes, I said hour. Usually I get excited when the timer rolls past 45:00 and the lesson is still going--bonus guitar! This video mercilessly continues on past 1:05.

The video setup is questionable. Because of the camera angle, most of the video is looking straight into Scotty's crotch. There's no backdrop of a stage or random classic guitars or amps. Just a plain white room (no black curtains).

The guitar playing, again, is incredible. Scotty opens with the well-worn, but always tasteful, Mystery Train in 'E'.

From there, he speaks maybe a total of 60 words through the whole video. He just plays until he stumbles across something clever, says 'Watch this...', plays it again at half speed (which is still 2x as fast as you or I can play), then continues on with what is essentially an hour long vamp.

Again, he's super talented, for what he does. If your aspiration is to play 'country shred', fitting as many notes as you can into 8 bars, this might be worthwhile.

If you want to learn something without pouring over the tabs and running the 'slow motion' feature on an endless loop, I'd pass this one up.

This DVD falls at the bottom of the Hot Licks pile, along with Buddy Guy and Danny Gatton.",1219881600,13,1750,4.396284829721362
8134856,4,B000GWBN26,"If you want to see someone play some amazing hot licks for just inspirational purposes, then this will wet your appetite. If you want to play this way, then get ready to give up your life, and spend 10 hours a day practicing like a robot. No guarantees with that routine either. Some people are just physically gifted. If you practice your scales, arpeggios(with your eyes closed), and learn some harmony, you could be happy. You won't be Scotty Anderson.",1184803200,2,455,4.7
8134857,5,B000GWBN26,"WHEN I SAW DANNY GATTON PLAY, IT JUST BLEW MY MIND. I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY COULD EVER TOP THAT. THAT IS UNTIL I PURCHASED THIS DVD. THIS GUY IS JUST INCREDIBLE, HE'S GOT IT ALL. WHY HE IS NOT A HOUSEHOLD NAME IS BEYOND ME. I BELIEVE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE ON THE GUITAR TO BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THIS FANTASTIC PLAYER, BUT YOU CAN ALSO BUY THIS JUST FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT. THIS DVD HAS MOTIVATED ME TO BECOME A BETTER PLAYER, IT SHOWS YOU JUST WHAT CAN BE DONE ON THE GUITAR. YOU HAVE TO JUST DIGEST A LITTLE AT A TIME AND ADD IT TO YOUR PLAYING. BUY THIS DVD, THIS IS FANTASTIC!",1184716800,4,588,4.034188034188034
