8430885,4,B000WNFXES,"I found these 4 stories quite interesting and a lot of fun to watch...there is quite a difference from one short film to the next... a fireside chat with ""George and Martha"" and their amusing 'discussions' about politics had me in stitches...""Yer Anus in the A.M"" shows an embattled 'Don Anus' lamenting about being misunderstood on his morning show when he referred to a black female college basketball team in racially derogatory terms...his young black wife gives him a lesson in 'tolerance'...""What's Brewin' Craig?"" is a satire on a young successful Memphis filmmaker, Craig Brewer, interviewing various yokel locals about whether they feel Craig is a legend before his time...""The Ancient One"" is my favorite, showing and interviewing an ancient Kung Fu warrior who claims to have a secret weapon in his 'arsenal' of moves that has dispatched unlucky opponents in the past...his move is finally revealed and you really aren't prepared for it...hilarious.
The compilation of shorts have all been shot in Standard video mode unfortunately, and lacks the sharpness and quality of HD video but don't let that keep you from buying this little creative gem...the director uses actors from Memphis and he's prominent as the lead in three of the shorts...""Four on the Floor"" is approximately 25 minutes and length and is perfect for a short trip into some really zany characterizations.",1341532800,,1384,5.155555555555556
