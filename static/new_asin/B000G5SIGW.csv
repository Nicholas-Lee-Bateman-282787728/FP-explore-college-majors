8128874,3,B000G5SIGW,"Poor casper. His character starts off as a part of a bank robbing team that goes horribly wrong. Next thing he knows, He's once again working as a guard in a bank with no air conditioning in the middle of Texas. A hot place? You bet. The only up-shot is the fact he's banging the bosses beautiful wife. Things go from bad to worse when he picks up a hitch-hiker with some very dangerous friends. Sounds like an ugly mess? It is. When the bullets start flying, you can be sure someone is gonna go down for the count.",1325635200,2,515,4.212121212121212
8128875,5,B000G5SIGW,I was pleasantly surprised by this low budget movie.  The plot was suspenseful and interesting.  The acting was good.,1191110400,,117,5.105263157894737
8128876,2,B000G5SIGW,"Casper Van Dien (of Starship Troopers) is an ex-bad cop who moves to a sleepy town to retire after his lover died in a foiled heist. But he soon gets drawn into a new heist with a bank owner's wife.

Throw in a Baldwin brother and some other unknowns, and you've got the makings of a pretty bad B-movie. Full of cliches and marginal acting, On The Border was really just a bore. Casper Van Dien has really gone downhill since Starship Troopers, and although the performances were tolerable for the most part, the role of his ex-partner (played by Bentley Mitchum) was so bad it was painful to watch.

It was so predictable and dull, I fast-forwarded through most of the last 1/3 of the movie & all of the gratuitous love scenes.

Only two things kept this movie afloat: the good performance of one of the bad guys, played by Bryan Brown (FX, Cocktail), and the promise of an interesting twist at the end. Otherwise I would have shut it off after 30 minutes and given it a 1-star.",1117756800,,979,4.397790055248619
8128877,5,B000G5SIGW,"I came across this movie one evening after I have finished studying. As I turned the TV on, an image of a beautiful man immediately caught my eyes and made me examine a little longer. It didn't take long for me to I realized it was one of my favorite actor Casper Van Dien. The camera never made him look better. His heavenly beauty captures the very essense of the story and the heart-pounding actions that keeps us off our seats throughout the movie. If you are a Casper fan, this is one not to be missed...",1006992000,9,509,4.257731958762887
