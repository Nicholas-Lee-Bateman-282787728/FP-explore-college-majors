It is very well done and very clear to understand. They demonstrations are excellent and they cover extremely important aspects of playing this position. The DVD has truly helped my undertstanding of this difficult position and has made my game more enjoyable. If you are a goalie and want some solid training support, this is the perfect investment.",1314835200,,524,4.526315789473684
8402327,5,B003QIUS8C,"My 9 year old is a squirt goalie.  I am a goalie (C league).  We were both looking to improve our skill level.  I bought Volume 1 along with several other goalie DVDs a couple of years ago for my son as his goalie coach at the time was not doing a good job. Pro Hybrid Training was by far the best by far out of the group.  I then invested in Volume 2 which is also excellent.  I was hoping that a 3rd volume would be released and was very excited when I saw it available and bought it immediately.  It provides exceptional advanced techniques that are designed to help you take your skills to the next level.  This video presents a long list of concepts and techniques that will help a good goalie become a great goalie.  If you are series about goal-tending and want to become the best you can, this is without a doubt a great investment in your career.

The Pro Hybrid Goalie DVDs have helped both of us improve tremendously.  The differences in his abilities to those of other goalies in the area is clearly visible.  His skill level easily exceeds many of the other goalies in the area and amazes most that watch him.  Much of what he has learned has been from this series.

If you are just starting out, start with Volume 1 and once you master the techniques there, advance to Volume 2.  And then when ready, Volume 3.  If you have played for a while, I suggest starting with Volume 2 which quickly reviews Volume 1 and then advancing to Volume 3.  If you are a seasoned goaltender, you would probably be fine skipping Volumes 1 and possibly 2 and going only with 3, although you still may want to start with Volume 2.

I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this DVD or the entire series.",1306368000,3,1703,4.30503144654088
