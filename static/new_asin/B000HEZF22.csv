8139516,5,B000HEZF22,"Virginia's choreo was very cute.  Loved the performance section also.  Love Love Loved it.  I purchased the music to the choreo which was longer than Virginia's version -easy to edit/chop to fit the choreo. I am an advanced dancer, so I usually do my own choreos, but I would definitely dance this one w/ a few changes to suit my style. Very Pleased.  Will buy more Virginia DVDs in the future.",1356912000,,394,4.507042253521127
8139517,4,B000HEZF22,"This a nice intermediate combination and choreography dvd. The song played for the choreo is a classic belly dance song and can be found on the VERY BELLY DANCE cd; ""My Music Intro"", also available through Amazon.  The choreography is Classical Egyptian Cabaret, which I enjoy and appreciate.

Virginia provides clear instruction verbally and visually through out her video.  The camera provides a full view of her body so you can see what her legs and feet are doing.  I like the menu indexing of the combos.  For each combo there is a tutorial and one practice with the music.  I agree, some of us are used to other instructional videos that repeat the practice portion a few times and that would have been a nice feature.  But I've gotten past that, and it is working out okay.  There are 10 combinations and at the end she dances the choreo with her own style.  I use her performance as my practice for continuity of the combinations. The combo lessons are probably only about 40 minutes long if you play it straight through.

The choreography is challenging but not over the top for an intermediate dancer with a few years of lessons under her coin belt.  Once the steps and combos have been mastered, I think this will be a great choreo to practice graceful arms, framing, body expression and gestures. Although you have to pay attention to what she is doing in this regard, because that is not a part of her instruction.  The dance is exciting and manageable to learn and will be great to practice more expression while performing.

After her choreo performance, Virginia does a fun drum solo.

All in all, this video provides the classical belly dance that I prefer and has great value in enhancing my own dancing.  I think this video is worth having in a personal library for both the choreo and for combo ideas.",1307404800,,1821,4.611801242236025
8139518,2,B000HEZF22,I was so disappointed with this dance video! It is so confusing and not fun at all.  She will say in the video now go to your right and she is going left and I don't know which way to go.  When she says dance to the left she is going to the right.  They should have done this video in front of a mirror.  Big disappointment.,1220659200,,324,3.791044776119403
8139519,4,B000HEZF22,"I believe this DVD is made as a sequel to Virginia's first DVD ""Introduction to Bellydance Technique"". As the title suggests, it features a complete choreography broken down in segments.

Virginia in a attractive brunette probably in her late thirties or early forties. She has a pleasant demeanor and a technique I'd give a limb to have. Her facial expression while dancing reminded me of Nourhan Sharif. This actually is no considence as Virginia has studied under the great Yousry Sharif.

I do not have the first DVD but obviously Virginia presumes you already have it as she calls out moves and combinations she does not show. And intermediate dancer would not have a problem with these though. I'm at intermediate/advanced level and did not see anything too challenging technique-wise.

Virginia instructs in a small room which is very brightly lit, so you can see everything. The quality of production is quite good as well. The instuctor wears a nice top, a hipscarf and long black parts which however are cut at the front, so you can see the knees! She immediately gets down to business (no warm-up shown). Virginia then breaks down all 9 combinations. After showing each segment, she dances through it with music before proceeding to the next part.

The combinations are quite good and most of them are universal. These go with the music very very well which is great but unfortunately not always seen in performances. There is little repetition in them - and the overall dance appears diverse while giving the audience the opportunity to enjoy some of the best moves. I love one of Virginia's last combinations, shimmy, hip twists and 90 degree turn 4 times (like 12, 3, 6, 9 hours on the clock).

After the instruction Virginia performs the whole dance in full costume (what a great costume by the way!). It shows some slight variations as well here and there.

There is a bonus drum solo performance with Virginia. It made my jaw drop. Virginia DOES have a killer technique! Her shimmies are fabulous and she does amazing accents with hops and hands to the drumming. Her dancing is absolutely flawless, a great example how a woman with a bit of a belly and hips can become the best of performers.

This DVD is a real must-have in every serious student of bellydance. I warmly recommend it also to cabaret dancers who need new, fresh ideas. I haven't seen elsewhere a lot of her combinations and her style and drum solo performance are so inspiring.

Then having said this, why didn't I give it 5 stars? My only complaint here is the lenght of the DVD: only 40 min, 33 of these spent teaching. Virginia demonstrates the combinations just once before showing them with music. I'm already going advanced and while none of what she showed was technically too challenging, I was having difficulties memorizing the sequence to begin with. Second, you only get to see the choreography from one angle which can be confusing with the weight changes she uses all the time. I think that for the price, they could have spent a couple more minutes on each combination to show it again, more slowly, or from a different side.

My advice: if you are still not comfortable with the basic moves, do wait before you get this DVD. However, if you are at least at intermediate level and are interested in a different and inspiring chreography, make sure to check out Virginia. :)",1175040000,22,3372,4.7406143344709895
