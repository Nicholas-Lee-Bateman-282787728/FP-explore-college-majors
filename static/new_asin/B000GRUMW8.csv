8133994,1,B000GRUMW8,It stunk!!! It wasn't a movie it was a documentary. Wasn't at all what I was expecting. I threw it straight in the garbage!!!,1445212800,,125,4.25
8133995,5,B000GRUMW8,This was just a replacement for one that we had before and got damaged or lost. It is great to have an undamaged one back into our library.,1402790400,,139,4.0
8133996,5,B000GRUMW8,"If you watch the History Channel or Discover among others, you will see they show a plethora of Documentaries about the End Times and and or the end of the world. Whats deferent about this Documentary  is it is presented by people who take the Bible and Bible prophecy seriously. (on The first disk we Look at those bible prophecies about the end times along with what science and other non Biblical prophecies (such as the Mayan Calendar, the Egyptian great pyramid, Hopi prophecies) can tell us out our future. It can be very frighting, but I think it is very important information to know and can save your life or even more important your eternal soul. The second disk is all about some specific Bible prophecies and how they point to us being very close to the end times. Also there is a very good section on the Rapture, what is it and is it Biblical. This is must view for Christians and non Christians alike.",1322956800,,916,4.485029940119761
8133997,3,B000GRUMW8,"Maybe is because I own so many dvd's on the matter, that I found this one ok.. not a big deal of dvd, full of info for people, I was expecting more though.",1184889600,2,155,3.727272727272727
8133998,5,B000GRUMW8,"This was very interesting, but I wish I could have just rented it. My teenager watched it first and was very impressed with all the info in this DVD.",1174780800,3,149,4.172413793103448
8133999,5,B000GRUMW8,The film is put together right. I think that everyone that has love in their  heart for other human beings should see this film. It will give them an insight into what it will be like if they don't. You have to keep God in your life and study about him until the Lord comes a second time.,1168819200,8,288,3.9655172413793105
8134000,5,B000GRUMW8,"we have been in the end times since the birth of yahshua ha masheeakh eroneously called jesus christ. in rabbinical judaism the rabbis hold to an old biblical belief that the masheeakh at his coming will begin the end of days. even ha naveem (the prophets) of hshem prophecized about what would happen in the last days. yochannan (john) the beloved talmid of yahshua wrote about the end times in the book revelation.  the essenes in hebrew osseem (ebionites-poor ones) wrote about the end of days that was found in the dead sea scrolls. the sun will lose its light and the mooon turn red as blood, the heavens will roll up like a scroll. the elements will burn up with fervent heat. this to a modern day person could see a corelation with global warming caused by pollution. however it is Hshem (G'D) that allows this to happen. with islam on the rise and terrorism on the forefront of so many people's minds and lives just shows we are in the end times and getting closer and closer of the coming of the anti-christ (one who is against and thinks he or she can replace the true masheeakh yahshua)
  for true believers the end times is one of expectancy and deliverance. for the unbelievers and the world the end times is one of judgment and horror.
  i believe and pray that people will repent (turn away) and confess their sin before G'D and their congregation.  then put their trust in the saviour annointed by G'd who is named yahshua not jesus.
  this film will humble people, and hopefully G'D willing also will open their hearts to repentance and salvation.

  maranata yahshua (please come yahshua ha masheeakh)",1166918400,16,1619,4.606271777003484
