2111233,2,B0002OOV4A,"Overall this one is only OK, it's not what I expected.  I was somewhat disappointed when first watching this one.  I'm so used to the massiveness of Andre Riew on PBS or on other video (Tuscany), this one is a bit in a small scale of performance.",1167782400,,246,4.212765957446808
2111234,2,B0002OOV4A,"Good music, Great memories of Christmas, and each song so well done.",1163116800,,68,4.75
2111235,1,B0002OOV4A,This is a great Christmas DVD to watch on a cold night or even a warm night,1140825600,3,75,3.4705882352941178
2111236,2,B0002OOV4A,"Probably my own fault but I only discovered upon playing this DVD that it was only a 60-minute recording.  A waste of the DVD format?

The setting is just too 'twee' - an orchestra inside a manger/stable?

This DVD was the only let-down we have experienced in all of the Andre Rieu recordings we have bought to date.",1138406400,8,316,4.413793103448276
2111237,4,B0002OOV4A,In my 86 years of living this is the very best Spirit of  Christmas program that I have ever been privilege to watch and hear....My compliments to Mr Rieuand his great musicians.. I thank you! Bob Gates Col USAF Ret,1135900800,36,215,4.375

this DVD is a must..he brings out the magic

2111240,1,B0002OOV4A,"Andre Rieu is a marvelous performer.  However,

this dvd will not play on a Bose system.",1123545600,4,88,4.4375
2111241,5,B0002OOV4A,"Andre shares his personal remembrances of Christmas time, Church & of course Music. Andre Rieu has made a genre all his own.  Buy this DVD and transport yourself to Christmas with Andre Rieu.

O Daughter of Zion, From Heaven High I Come To You.. soft, beautiful, moving. Tomorrow's The Day Children, excellent. Powerful & Graceful is Gloria In Excelsis Deo.. and so it goes.

We find Andre & the Johann Strauss Orchestra in a stone and wooden barn, filled with children, animals and Christmas decor. We see the reverence of his music as he plays his prayers in a beautiful church.

Christmas with Andre Rieu contains 27 songs, everyone of them beautiful.  If you have but one DVD to play for Christmas, this is the one.  Sally@AndreRieuFans.com",1096934400,114,744,4.818897637795276

I LOVED THE DVD SO MUCH, I BOUGHT FOUR MORE TO SHARE WITH MY BROTHER AND SISTERS AND THE PRIEST.  MY PRIEST WAS FORTUNATE TO SEE HIM LIVE IN THE USA.

2111249,5,B0002OOV4A,"I gave this DVD to my elderly parents who own close to all of the Andre Rieu DVD's  My mother watched this every day for the weeks leading up to Christmas and never tired of it.  They also enjoyed Home for the Holidays, but this one was more intimate.",1389052800,,251,4.1020408163265305
2111250,2,B0002OOV4A,Very few songs we really enjoyed. It's also quite different from his normal DVD concerts. Looks like it was produced long before the big production shows that he does now.,1375142400,,171,4.733333333333333
2111251,5,B0002OOV4A,All of his music is great.  This showed a more intimate side of his life with family.  Just a wonderful performance.,1363996800,,116,4.476190476190476
2111252,5,B0002OOV4A,"Andre Rieu has the exceptional ability to share the world's greatest music in the way that warms the heart and makes your spirit soar with it's beauty and grandeur.  One of my husband and my personal favorites that we play all the time, either on CD or video.  A truly blessed man to be able to touch so many people with his great orchestra and their talent and choice of music.  KUDOS to Him and his fellow musicians.  The cream of the crop.",1356912000,,442,4.289156626506024
2111253,2,B0002OOV4A,"It was very boring music DVD for Christmas.
I like the rest of his music except this tape.
We all get in sleepy while we were listing music.
I don't like this DVD. But I like all the rest of Andre Rieu's DVD.",1356825600,,208,3.86046511627907
2111254,5,B0002OOV4A,"Excellent DVD - shipped in a timely manner, good quality. Would definitely recommend.  Any of Andre Rieu productions are extremely well done and I believe they are always a sell out.",1327881600,,182,4.870967741935484
2111255,5,B0002OOV4A,"What makes this Christmas offering by Andre' Rieu unique is the tenderness, warmth, and simplicity conveyed.  Taking place in a barn with his Johann Strauss Orchestra still in their usual finery, we find the maestro interspersing his fine set with scenes of goats and donkeys, children in angel costumes (sometimes being lightly playful) and winter scenes underscoring the beauty and darkness of the Northern European terrain.

Andre' takes time between numbers to share the spirits (Good ghosts, if you will ;>) ) of his Christmas pasts, and the whole affair becomes intimate and relaxed, such a contrast to the usual spectacle of his other concert films, (including '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andre-Rieu-Christmas-Around-the-World/dp/B000I2J7YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andre Rieu - Christmas Around the World</a>' which I also recommend.)

While some of the shots may seem too casual and some spots not rehearsed, it is the natural flow and low-keyness that give both the music and the event a natural setting for enjoyment and celebration.",1322265600,2,1089,5.923566878980892
2111256,5,B0002OOV4A,"So enjoyed, and appreciated, this wonderful presentation which is suitable for family viewing -- all ages.  Andre Rieu shows deep respect for his audience, his orchestra, and his guests.  We can tell he so

enjoys what he does -- not for the audience, but with them.  This is a ""must-have"" for families who want to celebrate the Christmas Season in pure joy with their entire family and all their friends.  Have even enjoyed it all alone.  As in each of his

performances, Andre Rieu gives his all -- calmly, peacefully, adoringly.  Another time, another place, now.",1295481600,,566,4.822916666666667
2111257,3,B0002OOV4A,"A very enjoyable DVD with a kind of a homely feel about it but I personally miss the big production numbers which I have come to expect from Rieu but having said that this was recorded some years ago and for me it shows.
 But I would still put this DVD on on a Christmas list.",1285718400,,276,3.9285714285714284
2111258,5,B0002OOV4A,This is a different setting/style than most Andre Rieu videos. Much smaller scale and more personable. Just the right touch for a family Christmas Eve.,1268179200,2,151,5.08
2111259,1,B0002OOV4A,i ordered 3 andre rieu cds and 2 of them did not play at all.  Extremely disapplointed.,1262131200,,87,4.117647058823529
2111260,4,B0002OOV4A,"This DVD is the opposite of Rieu's recent ""whale of a show"" format. Here, it's just the music and the player in the quiet of a winter's night in a stable. Candlelight prevails on the Christmas trees, and several scenes where little kids are holding candles while seated on the straw. very disconcerting. Apparently they all survived. Nice to see some jazzy numbers, even a Dixieland one. A few numbers move to different locales, like church. As always, very stylish. Rieu shares spoken memories of performing in church, making decorations with his grandma, etc. If you want spectacular, get his Christmas Around the World DVD. Very long, and hits all the fabulous carols. We love them both.",1262044800,2,690,4.905982905982906
2111261,1,B0002OOV4A,We couldn't use it on our DVD player.  It wasn't for all regions.  I was very disappointed.,1260230400,,91,4.294117647058823
2111262,1,B0002OOV4A,"I'm not able to play the DVD as it came in region ""5"".....that does not play in blue rays here in USA.....I don't now what to do with this product......can you help me please?",1259539200,,175,4.176470588235294
2111263,5,B0002OOV4A,"Andre Rieu's Christmas video is sensational!  It is the perfect video to watch during the holidays ... He tells of his childhood in Austria, and the warm and lovely Christmas Eve's, and holy times in  his home as a young boy.  This is a wonderful Christmas gift (send it a bit early), to be enjoyed year after year, time and time again!

If you've not discovered Andre Rieu on your Public TV stations, or in Concert, now is the time to discover this wonderful, warm, (handsome) and extremely talented entertainer.  His videos take you away ~ to a place of peace and relaxation ~ always!

Simply the BEST!",1249776000,,604,4.546296296296297
2111264,5,B0002OOV4A,"This is as much Old World charm as you can fit into your living room! The rustic setting with exposed wood beams and hay, the simple manger scene,the rosy glow from the flickering candles,and the relaxed and enthusiastic small audience all lend this video warmth and authenticity. As always, Rieu's musical performance is impeccable, and his orchestra is spirited and entertaining.  His vivid memories of his own childhood Christmases are touching.  Although this isn't a new release, I'd recommend it as a terrific holiday gift.  It has the look and feel of a real and reverent celebration.",1228262400,,591,5.072164948453608
2111265,5,B0002OOV4A,"This DVD features music that was also heard on the CD ""The Christmas I Love"" It was also featured on a different Christmas Special done a few years ago, also shown on PBS. The selections are all beautifully played, as you might expect from Andre Rieu and the orchestra. I thought it was interesting how far they went with the theme, even to the point of turning
a chuch into a european version of a Nativity Scene with candle lit Christmas trees all around, and the torches, and all the hay the fire marshall must have been a little more than nervous. When you watch this DVD Andre Rieu shares his memeories of the Christmas Holidays as a youth.
This adds to the warmth and charm of the perfomances. Highly recommended.",1219017600,3,719,4.4961832061068705
2111266,4,B0002OOV4A,"As always, artistically satisfying performance with good technical quality. The selections were appropriate for the season, pretty much what I expected. Compared to some more recent performances, it seemed a bit short. Most of his more recent performances are longer. I believe this was made in an earlier era when Andre did not have many soloists, so this would account for the fact that there were no solos in the performance.
The setting was quite appropriate for the season.",1196208000,,478,5.063291139240507
2111267,4,B0002OOV4A,"I loved this DVD and the music and setting was just wonderful. However i feel that people who produce this sort of thing should consider us Aussies. We didn't see any wide brown land, massive sun in a hot summer sky that is nearly navy blue in colour; as it is here in Australia at Christmas time. A hot dusty scene would have been appreciated; with abundant eucalipts and brown drought seared grass.

Christmas here means wearing hardly any clothes, going swimming; eating seafood, drinking very cold drinks; as the temperature is usualy around the 35 - 40 deg C mark and i think people should consider this when making a DVD of this type.

2111268,5,B0002OOV4A,All my family enjoy Christmas and our home is known as the Christmas House in the small community we live in.

2111271,1,B0002OOV4A,"Having seen the program on PBS, I'm sure the content of this DVD is great - if only I could play it. It won't play on my computer DVD drive, nor on the DVD player hooked up to my TV, nor on TV DVD players of two other people I've tried. My big mistake was buying it in September as a Christmas gift and, wanting to leave the shrink wrap intact, not opening it in time to return it.
