8692303,3,B00QQRBKMI,"It's hard to know how to categorize this with stars. I like Cathe's workouts, but these are both really FULL of jumping moves. If you have downstairs neighbors, don't get this DVD; they will hate you.

So although the quality of the workout is fine, I would say, it's not suitable for people who can't do a lot of jumping.",1471651200,2,322,4.366666666666666

Highly recommend for those who want a new and challenging workout!!,1430870400,5,293,4.938775510204081
8692307,5,B00QQRBKMI,"I don't know how Cathe does it!  She is 51 years old and she is still jumping like the Energizer bunny!  My jumping days are long over, but I still love these types of workouts.  This DVD is part of Cathe's Ripped with Hiit Series.

PLYO HIIT ONE (27:16 minutes)

Workout premise:  14 random cardio intervals of varying tempos. This type of workout produces the afterburn effect, where you continue to burn more calories after the workout.

Equipment needed:  exercise mat for a marker
Workout crew: Amanda, Deazie, Jai and Kate
Outfits:  Sky blue tops with navy bottoms
Premixes range from 27 minutes to 44 minutes.

The intervals start out easier and gradually progress.

Some of the exercises include:

One arm burpees
Vertical butt kicks at hyper speed
Vertical knee hops not on beat - these were annoying to me since they were off the beat.

About halfway through the workout, you take out the mat and use it as a marker.  Some of the exercises are:

Forward hops
Circle sprints
Wide burpees.

I am short so my feet kept touching the mat.  I don't know how Cathe does it!  I think she is also short, but she manages to never touch the mat.  She is a machine!

There were no modifications offered, so this is not a workout for beginners.  I thought that several of the exercises were a knee injury waiting to happen.  I know enough to modify so that won't happen to me, but if you are prone to injuries, this may not be the workout for you.

PLYO HIIT TWO (27:02)

Workout premise:  13 step intervals of varying times and tempos.  This type of workout can help bust plateaus.  You usually do 2 rounds of each exercise, alternating leading side.

Equipment needed:  Step with 2 risers per side, 1 dumbbell - Cathe uses a 10 pound one
Workout crew:  Amanda, Deazie, Jai and Kate
Outfits:  Pretty pink/coral tops with black or grey bottoms
Premixes range from 25 to 45 minutes.

Exercises in this workout:

1.  Warm up - 4:36 minutes

2.  Straddle jump freezes
3.  Over and over jumps - double jump side hop
4.  Pulsing side to side lunge off of step with 10 pound dumbbell
5.  Jump up and down off step with a power 7
6.  Uneven jump squats in a box around step
7.  Wide jumps onto step with 1 plyo  jack
8.  Fast feet straddle shuffles
9.  Forward and back straddle hops
10. Wide tap lunges
11. Power turning squats with lunge back
12. Over step and back with 2 burpees
13. Front corner step lunge to back corner lunge with 10 pound dumbbell
14. Jump up onto step, step down with ski hops and power 7.

15. Cool down - 3:23 minutes.

This workout grew on me.  I was dreading it because I didn't think I would be close to keeping up with Cathe and crew since I can't do much high impact.  A funny thing happened though, about 15 minutes into the workout I felt that endorphin rush and really enjoyed the rest of the workout.

Cathe offers a few modifications, but this is definitely not a workout for beginners or intermediates because of the high impact moves.  If you know your body and know alternative moves then you would be fine.

If you are looking for a heart-pumping and energizing workout, this DVD is for you!",1427846400,20,3122,4.408450704225352
