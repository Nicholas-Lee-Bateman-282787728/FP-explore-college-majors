8389090,2,B0035JWY8E,"I should have done my research with this movie.  It's extremely low-budget, unofficial documentary in the style of a VH1 special, but not as good.  Therer's some kind odd stock footage of strip clubs and concert crowd footage used as something to look at whlie the narrator is talking.  This superfluous footage is repeated something like 20 times.  When the guy runs out of stuff to say, thry play generic metal riffs that aren't Ozzy or Black Sabbath.

I gave this a second star, because there is a real interview with Ozzy Osbourne in there, and something we haven't seen before, an interview with the people that threw the bat on stage during that famous incident.

  Anyway, if you are a hardcore fan like me, I'd just rent it.  It's not any kind of sanctioned release, and there is no Ozzy music of any kind.  Most fans will know the basic Ozzy story, also.  Don't let the awesome cover fool you.",1276992000,6,902,4.540372670807454
