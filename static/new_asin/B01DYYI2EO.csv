8757368,2,B01DYYI2EO,"This is possibly one of the most well-intentioned, as well as one of the most disastrous, adaptations I've ever had to put on pause.

I read the novel shortly before going to Albania in 2016. And I was excited to return and find that it had been made into a film but for some reason my intuition told me to wait. The novel is a complex character and cultural study of an Albanian woman, Hannah, who gives up her studies in Tirana to return to her home in the mountains and, taking a vow of perpetual chastity, becomes a ""man"", Mark.

Why she does it, why she decides to leave, why she decides to begin again; her reasons are as much about modern Albania, its clannish social structure and mores (blood feuds are not uncommon), the fall of Communism...all of this complexity gets reduced to country mouse/city mouse some tired pseudo tropes about gender, set against the vacuity of Italian water dancing. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that the cinematography is incredible, the actors' talent is apparent despite the desiccated script.",1526774400,,1047,4.654054054054054
8757369,4,B01DYYI2EO,"Laura Bispuris has a very clear intent in her debut feature Vergine guirata and the director sets about delivering its theme in the most direct way possible; consequently it's one that doesn't have much time for poetic observations or even an openness that might allow the spectator to meet it half-way.

There's perhaps not much room for open interpretation anyway in the case of how life is for women living in a remote village in northern Albania.  Hana (Alba Rohrwacher) has been taken in by a family there, but seems determined to follow her own path, rejecting the restrictions that have been placed on the work that women can do and even on who they choose to love.  Her friend/ adopted sister Lila has found this lifestyle impossible and has left the region to marry and live in Italy.  Hana has taken an even more drastic step and chosen the way of the tradition of burmesha (sworn virgin), renouncing her female identity to live as a man.

Hana, under her male identity as Mark, has now also found that it is time to leave her Albanian home and goes to find her sister by adoption in Rome.  Still living and dressing as a man - the masculine identity of Mark left ambiguous but only for someone who don't know Alba Rohrwacher - it takes some while for Hana to rediscover herself, and inevitably, having lived as a 'sworn virgin', there are some issues to be resolved within herself with regards to her sexuality, which is assailed by  sensations at the swimming pool where her niece is training as a synchronised swimmer.

Learning to become a woman again is certainly a unique subject for a film, but essentially Vergine guirata is just another spin on the idea of identity, on learning to feel comfortable with your own sexuality and who you are.  It is very simple and direct on those terms, and it seems to borrow something from Celine Schiamma's Water Lilies in how it relates those themes to synchronised swimming.  Even though it is straightforward in its theme and focusses on the unique situation of Hana/Mark, Bispuri's film does take a few moments out to linger over a variety of bodies at the poolside to suggests that there is more than one choice available, and that we are all free to control who it is we want to be.",1517011200,,2242,4.5964912280701755
