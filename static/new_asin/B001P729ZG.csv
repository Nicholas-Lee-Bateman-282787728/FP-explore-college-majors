8332277,5,B001P729ZG,"This is part of the Scholastic / Weston Woods series that brings popular children's books to life through animation and talented narrators.  The theme of this one is magic wishes and spells, many of which go awry.  The DVD includes
Strega Nona - An Italian witch/grandmother/wise woman has a magic pot that produces pasta.  Her hapless helper Big Anthony creates big trouble when he uses it while Strega Nona is away because he doesn't know how to make the pasta stop.
Sylvester and the Magic Pebble - A cute little donkey thinks it's great when he finds a magic pebble, but things don't work out as well as he expected.  My young library patrons like this one a lot.
The Stonecutter - Tasaku is a Japanese stone cutter whose wishes get out of hand, as he goes from wishing to be a Prince, to the Sun, and then a mountain.  This one has a dark feeling, and has an abrupt, odd ending.  I'm not really a fan of this one.
The Amazing Bone - A pig named Pearl finds a talking bone that  saves her from .Mr. Fox.  Wonderfully narrated by John Lithgow.
 Teeny-Tiny and the. Witch Womb - This story of three brothers is similar to Hansel and Gretal, except the youngest brother uses magic objects to escape the witch.
Don't miss the bonus material, which is Strega Nona and Sylvester and the Magic Pebble in Spanish.  Also, there are subtitles which a child can use to read along to improve reading skills, but these can be turned off
This is DVD gets checked out a lot from the library where I am the children's librarian.",1464307200,,1516,4.44043321299639

The illustrations are from the books, some animated, some still pictures.
Different actors' voices really add to the reading. My 2 year old twins loved
them and at almost 5, we still watch them.
Even I have not tired of them.
Highly recommend these CDs. A great investment.",1421884800,,303,4.735849056603773
