7815560,5,6301758005,"There are a lot of jokes in this gem that I didn't get when I was a kid, and a lot that I did.  It's filled with old-school vaudeville style humor, complete with the ethnic take-offs.  It's gloriously innocent of PC without being offensive in the slightest (unless one is hell-bent on not getting jokes and taking offense).

One of my favorite animated films of any period; this is just a stouthearted joyride, for kids and adults alike.",1259193600,,437,4.576923076923077

Poor Lucky Luke becomes involved in a comic feud between the bumbling Dalton brothers and a crazy cast of western characters.

The easy ridin' straight-shootin' Lucky Luke rounds up the bumbling Dalton brothers - and a rip-roaring pack of laughs - in this rollicking music hall tale of odd-ball outlaws, wacky western yahoos and a befuddled wonder dog who spends most of his time wondering what's going on. The brilliant work of the finest French animators highlights this spritely, outrageous recounting of how the west was fun. A wild and woolly cartoon free-for-all the whole family will love!",1102636800,,609,5.141414141414141
7815562,5,6301758005,"When I was seven, my dad bought a VCR.  The first video we rented was Lucky Luke, The Ballad of the Daltons.  Fearing no danger of being arrested by the FBI for copying this video, my dad used his video camera to do so.  I fell in love with it at seven, and never fell out.  It's my favorite cartoon.  I have to admit, I've had a bit of a crush on the dashing, dark-haired, quite cowboy ever since.  It's funny, and it tells a good story, with old fashioned animation.  I'm glad I actually found this on VHS because my copied copy is getting a bit old.",1094688000,,552,4.055555555555555
