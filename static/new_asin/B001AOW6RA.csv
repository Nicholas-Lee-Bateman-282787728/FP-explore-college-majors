8310573,4,B001AOW6RA,"I used to watch ""(The New)YOU ASKED FOR IT""1981version when I was young. But ""YOU ASKED FOR IT""1950 version. I hadn't been born yet. I just watched this 2-Disc DVD from Amazon. There were many dangerous shows in the 1951version such as ""US national archery champion Stan Overby shot an apple off his assistant's head"" or ""Reed Parham wrestled a giant anaconda"",etc. Was the show  originally broadcast live? If so,accidents could happen at any time.other interesting episodes,for example ""phony spiritualists exposed"" were very useful to many people ,and ""A race between a Chinese abacus (Suanpan)and an electric calculator"" where the winner was the calculator. According to Wikipedia,Japanese abacus (Soroban) beat an electric calculator on November 12, 1946.(one year after World War II  ) A contest was held in Tokyo between the Japanese abacus, used by Kiyoshi Matsuzaki, and an electric calculator, operated by US Army Private Thomas Nathan Wood. The abacus won. I wonder why nobody,in 1951,asked for this race again on TV. Can any knowledgeable historian answer this question? Maybe in the next time review.",1372204800,3,1112,5.3125
