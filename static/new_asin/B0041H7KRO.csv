4242827,5,B0041H7KRO,"John Barrowman is witty, hilariously funny, and really talented. His live performances are filled with a collection of musical theater hits, as well as some cover songs that anyone in their 40's would recognize. But, most of all, it is full of stories of his youth, his family and his loves. And don't forget his funny giggle! If you like John Barrowman, this is an absolute gem of a collection to have. This collectors edition contains both of John Barrowman's live performance DVD's, so this contains no new material for those of you who already have one or both of his DVD's.",1353888000,3,578,4.676470588235294

8412802,5,B0041H7KRO,"Fun to watch and listen to songs you've heard hundreds of times before from CD's and hear stories you've never heard.  John is such a fantastic entertainer.  I found myself wishing the concerts were longer.  Good thing there's two concerts in this set.  John's Scottish accent is hilarious to listen to, since I'm used to his using an American one on Torchwood and Arrow.",1447459200,2,371,4.75

8412808,5,B0041H7KRO,"I watched 'An Evening with John Barrowman' and was thrilled. I figured I'd save the 'Royal Albert Hall' performance for a rainy day, when I really needed cheering up. When that rainy day came, I huddled under my fleece blanket, clutching a tissue, and pressed play.

Oh. My. God!

From the first song, I had no choice but to smile. By the third, I was on my feet dancing. I applauded with the audience. I died laughing at a few of the performances. This man knows how to entertain. I wish I could see him perform live.",1388102400,2,518,4.329896907216495
