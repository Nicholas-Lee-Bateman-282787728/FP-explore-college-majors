8706758,3,B00UGQHBN2,"Scheming wheeler-dealer pursues show girl. Betty overacts and Victor is unlikable and overbearing. Betty sings and dances and shows a lot of leg. Lots of glitz and dance hall numbers. Very slim plot. Corny, not funny, and tiresome. You need to be a hard-core Betty Grable fan to love this film. Wasted my money on this one. Dont waste your time.",1467936000,,345,4.672131147540983
