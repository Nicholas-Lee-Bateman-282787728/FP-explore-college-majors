7102629,1,B00VSG3MSC,"Boring, OMG it's boring. Seasons 1 thru 4 were riveting. We could not wait for season 5. I HATE JOHN SNOW AND THE KNIGHTS WATCH, a big snooze fest. The blondie with the dragons is very boring as well. There are only three interesting characters left, Peter Dinklage and the tough little girl who wants to be a knight, and the tall blond lady who is a knight. We could care less about the rest of them. THEY ARE BORING! The problem with the show as we see it is they killed off all but three of the likable and/or interesting characters. Look up the ""Game of Chairs"" on YouTube. It's much more fun. I think this show is done for except for a few hardcore fans.",1433030400,9,659,4.196850393700787
7102630,3,B00VSG3MSC,"I have been watching Game of Thrones since Season 1 and have done some crazy stuff to make sure I can get to see it regularly.  I am so sad to say, however, that after 4 seasons of a thrilling roller coaster ride of intricate story lines, intrigue and the most shocking deaths of characters that I can remember ever in a series, season 5 is a disappointment.  Each episode seems to feature characters or story lines on their way to becoming something or going somewhere without actually GETTING there.  The story is not getting off the ground the way it has in the past.  It's difficult to describe, but there's a general feeling of dissatisfaction and wondering when things are really going to start to happen clearly.  I still love it, and remain a crazed and loyal fan....",1432598400,24,775,4.546762589928058

7102632,3,B00VSG3MSC,"This season the writers have taken the story in a drastically different direction than George RR Martin's original vision. While in some ways this makes sense, since certain story lines are already running out of source material, in other areas the decisions are just baffling. For example, the characters of Victarion, Euron, Young Griff, Arianne, and Lady Stoneheart have all been cut, but for some reason a large portion of the plot is dedicated to the Sandsnakes. There are also a lot of key moments from the book that have been rushed, such as the rebellion and execution of Jaynos Slynt, which takes place from beginning to end over the course of about five minutes. And Brienne coincidentally running into both Stark girls while exploring a massive continent is not very believable.

The one bright spot I've found is the unintentional comedy of Jaime/Bronn in Dorne. If you like B moving acting and things that are so bad they're good, like Top Gun and Troll 2, then Jaime Lannister and his wacky sidekick Bronne embarking on a covert mission to save the princess from the evil Arab ninjas might be for you! And let us not forget, ""the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant

While I still very much enjoy Game of Thrones, the writers are taking quite a few liberties with the plot, and I feel as though the show is starting to suffer for it. Not to mention this season has some damn lazy writing.",1431734400,65,1408,4.650602409638554
7102633,5,B00VSG3MSC,HOW ANYONE CAN SAY THIS SERIES IS NOT INTERESTING IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION THE TWISTS AND TURNS. HAS ME SAYING DIDNT SEE THAT COMING!!! FANTASTIC SERIES.LOOKING FWD TO 5TH SEASON DVD.,1430265600,3,182,5.1
7102634,5,B00VSG3MSC,"the best show on TV.... strays from the books but mostly in good ways, cutting out the story lines to nowhere found in book 5 .... I don't like whats happening with sansa ... interesting diversion at the end of season 4 but after watching the 3rd episode, she is merging into a story line she had no part of in the books",1430179200,5,320,4.095238095238095
7102635,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Season 5 is very good. There's a new king (because honestly, what's a GOT season without a new king waiting to be killed by 6 different armies). The power struggles continue between.....well....everyone. While highly entertaining, the whole season does feel like a transition to set up huge changes for season 6.

Arya Stark continues her journey to Braavos to meet the faceless man, in what is one of the most interesting story arcs of the series.

Sansa Stark is FINALLY starting to be an interesting character after laboring through 4 seasons of her expecting everything to just turn out well because she's rich. She's finally realized that there is a 'game' to game of thrones and that she has to play it. (She stinks at playing the game. But at least she's playing it.) Her fate is left unclear.

Oh, and there are finally dragons in this show that is supposed to have a lot of dragons. They don't show up for more than a few seconds until near the end of the season, but when dragons finally show up to do something they do it with a vengeance! It makes the wait for drag action well worth it! And the White Walkers stop being imaginary boogeymen and show up with authority as well.

Overall the production value of the series continues to be insanely high. The sets, the costumes, the props....they all create a visual image so real that by the end of each episode you feel like you just spent an hour in Westeros. The acting adds so much more on top of that, without a single bad player in the cast. The CGI is flawless and blends naturally with the live action and live sets. It doesn't look hokey or ""updated Star Wars"" at all. It's solid use of CGI, which is a refreshing change.

I won't talk about the details about how this season ended, but to call it a cliff hanger is an understatement. Before the credits roll on the final episode you're already excited fro season 6 to start.

Blu Ray is the only way to own this series. Regular DVD just doesn't present the detail that makes this show so phenomenal.

7102637,2,B00VSG3MSC,"HBO needs to stop releasing this show in garbage digipack packaging. What's wrong with standard Viva Elite blu-ray cases? If anything, this digi-junk just drives up the price for no reason. Season one got released in a standard case for $20 now. That's how every season should be.",1429833600,5,280,4.854166666666667
7102638,5,B00VSG3MSC,"In 2011, HBO decided to release a tv adaptation of a series of books penned by author George R.R. Martin. Game of Thrones has not only become a favorite tv show of mine, it has in fact become a worldwide phenomenon. And with Season 5 already underway, Game of Thrones shows no signs of slowing down.

After the shocking events that occurred in season 4, Cersei is shown giving her brother(lover) Jamie a tough talk for assisting their brother Tyrion in escaping. Meanwhile, Varys informs Tyrion of his intention to side with non other than the mother of dragons herself Daenerys Targaryen. And finally, Stannis Baratheon uses Jon Snow to try and convince Mance to accept Stannis's leadership and have the wildlings fight for Stannis, so that Stannis can take control of the North.

It need not be said that each individual plays his/her part very well on Game of Thrones. My two favorite characters Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister are portrayed exceptionally well by actors Kit Harington and Peter Dinklage. Lena Headey's character went through quite the unexpected ordeal last season, but Cersei looks to make her presence known so far this season. Maisie Williams continues to grow and come into her own as Arya Stark, while actress Emilia Clarke continues to reign as Daenerys Targaryen.

I have been equally impressed how each character's storyline ties into the series progression and direction throughout each season. The scenery of Season 5 is simply gorgeous and though I did notice a pacing issue in the second episode, Game Of Thrones continues to reward viewers with its enthralling storytelling, beautiful scenery, and the acting by each individual. I will definitely continue to rate the episodes until the season finale, and until next time!

Episode 1: 9/10
Episode 2: 9.10/10
Episode 3: 9.25/10
Episode 4: 8.9/10
Episode 5: 8.9/10
Episode 6 :8.7/10
Episode 7: 9.2/10
Episode 8: 9.25/10
Episode 9: 9/10
Episode 10:9.1/10

Overall, Season 5 proved to be a thrilling, and at times controversial for both critics and fans. I enjoyed the show all the way to the surprising finale. So until next year's visit to the realm, thank you to all who have read my review of Game of Thrones season 5.

Seeds that were planted during the very first season start to grow here explaining elements that you didn't even notice in the first season and damn near have to go back and watch it to see all the little nuances you missed.  This is only exemplified moving forward in Season 6 and 7 where things are happening that were ALWAYS supposed to be that way.

Three cheers to the Directors and Producers for talking with the author of the books and seeing that he had a plan and a direction for things that weren't written yet during season 1, yet they made sure were included in peoples facial expressions and mannerisms.  This really is a masterpiece of a show that transcends its setting to provide storytelling without the massive plot holes that accompany shows that don't have a definitive end point.",1523232000,,868,4.580645161290323

7102736,2,B00VSG3MSC,"Much has been written about this series. I just want to add my personal experience. Years ago I read the books. I was enthralled with the books but became a bit less so as I read further. The books became so obviously diluted and repetitive.  Then I noticed how formulaic and ultimately derivative the writing was. Pulp really. Then I understood the contempt of the Author for his readers.  The sixth novel has yet to come out.
The HBO series offers a similar experience. The first few seasons were gripping. I enjoy good storytelling and the direction was superb. But good stories have good endings.  I am now in midseason 5 in the HBO series. The joke is on me. Yet another ""undead"" story.  Watching the snow zombies punch through the walls of the fort I had to laugh because it did so remind me of Pirates of the Carribean.  I doubt I will finish watching this and do not care.

7102758,5,B00VSG3MSC,I purchased the first 2 episodes individually since I couldn't afford to buy the entire DVD set yet. I'm so glad I did. I later bought the DVD set from a store. It's nice that each episode can be purchased individually on amazon. When I got the DVD set I binge watched all 10 episodes in one day. IMO seasons 5 and 6 are the best of GOT. As a collector of GOT stuff and a fan of the show anyone who has enjoyed seasons 1-4 will enjoy season 5. They just keep getting better. I wish season 8 wasn't the final season. No show on TV is as good as GOT. Some come close but GOT reigns as the best of the best. I've heard that there will be a GOT spinoff show coming in 2020. Hopefully it will be just as awesome as GOT or even better! Have to wait and see. Until then I'm excited for season 8 which will come to TV sometime in 2019.,1520812800,,827,3.899408284023669

This series is a work of love, and it shows in the quality of acting, shot locations, studio sets, and writing.  Across the board, this is the best thing I've ever seen.  I am always glad to lend my GOT videos to friends, and then I sit back and wait for their phone calls and love the chance to talk with them about GOT and to hear their reactions to story events.

This is a MASTERFUL series.  MUCH WATCH.",1515801600,,567,4.261682242990654

The cinematography is beyond impressive...the characters are SO REAL, you will love some and DETEST others!!  I would suggest however, READ the 6 book series as it is beautifully written in such flowing prose, you'll forget it isn't critically acclaimed by the Academy of ARTIST!!!  How glum they are.  Really- this book series is for those who LOVE getting lost in their reading.  The film version is also quite gripping and daunting in the delivery of themes and exquisite dialogue especially by the 'little man'.  You'll have to watch the entire series.  If you haven't read the books...they are MUCH more imaginative and thorough in development.  ENJOY both!!",1511136000,,836,5.095588235294118

7103046,4,B00VSG3MSC,"Actually  I just started watching last fall and binged watched all 6 seasons.....I wanted to know what the big deal was....I ALMOST did not get through the first season because there was SO MUCH pornography and violence...rape and slitting the horse throat really threw me over the edge. However, with that being said, I did finish it because the story is phenomenal, the sets are amazing, the costumes are breath taking....and the acting is well pretty darn good...I was disappointed with the unnecessary pornographic sex and extreme violence. The story is so great and a lot of those situations could be ""implied"" rather than camera in your face stuff. I thought HBO could have told the story without all the graphic violence and still maintained a phenomenal fantastical story.  It could have been right up there with Lord of the Rings.....Unfortunately they chose to cheapen it.  I'm still going to watch it though and have nervous breakdowns and switch it off when my daughter walks in the room.",1500249600,,1000,4.940476190476191

7103063,3,B00VSG3MSC,"The season began promising, with a few road-trips taken by various characters. But, a whole 10 hours later, and everything ends in a fizzle of disappointment.  At least there were some friendships this season, which is more than can be said for past seasons.  Jaime and Bronn, Brienne and Pod, but very little was accomplished.  Real historical drama, like 'The Last Kingdom' or 'Vikings'  accomplish as much in one episode as this does in a season.  And the characters are more compelling because they are based upon reality, there are just fewer of them.  GoT is really poor entertainment, for the amount of time invested.  There are but a few characters that are of interest, and one gets a mere few minutes of them in an entire season. The modus operandi seems to be to create a buildup of expectation, only to have it amount to nothing.",1499817600,2,841,4.680272108843537

7103152,2,B00VSG3MSC,"For the show itself, 5 stars wouldn't be enough.  I think it's extraordinary.  But I'm rating the DVD sets here.  I purchased Seasons 1-6 as the separate sets, have watched them all and I'm just shocked and frankly angry at what poor quality these are.  The picture is just awful, particularly in scenes that are dark.  Think VHS quality.  I do not exaggerate. And it's every season, though oddly enough, some episodes are worse than others.

I really don't understand this.  I have many other shows on DVD, including HBO ones, and none of them are like this.  Muddy, blotchy, artifact-laden image quality, and sometimes even skipping.  For disclaimer's sake no, it is not my player, not my TV (I've tried them on a few players and screens), and these are the legit, licensed sets.

Then there's the packaging itself.  The ""fat"" sets that fold out with a disk on each page (versus the ""stacked disk"" sets) are also crap.  The plastic disk holders have a tendency to come unglued from the cardboard backings. I've heard others mention the same issue.  Again, I have other sets with a similar design and this doesn't happen with those.  What the heck is going on with the quality control where they're making these?  GoT deserves better.

Anyway, I can't recommend buying these.  And considering some of the problems I've heard with the BluRay disks, too (and my own negative experiences with BluRay players which makes me steer clear of converting over to that format), I'm not tempted to purchase again.  I'd recommend renting the shows instead and save your money, perhaps check a local library for them.  I may, in fact, donate my sets, as I'm not sure I could stand watching them again.

The discs themselves are hard to read (horrible printing) and they feel like they are going to crack when you try to remove them from the case.  Again, looks outstanding, but function is a 1-star.

7103275,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Physically, the disks are well packaged and it's nice that the case is the normal size of a single DVD movie and not a large case.

As far as the show goes, season 5 is when they start to get the storyline back on track to the same degree of excitement with seasons 1-2.  Seasons 3-4 got too deep into smaller events, character development and really it just started to drag.  If you loved seasons 1-2 then lost interest in the show, season 5 is a good spot to pick it up again.",1486944000,,478,4.118279569892473

In Season 5 of the award-winning HBO series Game of Thrones, writers conjure a plethora of new social movements, kingdoms we've never heard of, and boring side-characters to distract viewers from the fact that they are either unwilling or unable to advance the story in meaningful ways. Pacing and production values also suffer.",1486944000,,558,4.646464646464646

This season definitely did not disappoint-certainly not for the non-squeamish or faint of heart. I would definitely recommend watching this from the season one or it can be hard to follow, but all in all very great! We can't wait for season 7 to be released!!",1484697600,,565,4.495145631067961

Were it not for the last episode's ending, it may stand out even more.  This season had a lot going on.  There was a battle with white walkers, Tyrion meeting Daenerys, Arya arriving in Braavos, and so much more to like.

I must say that Season 5 had some superb moments including the deaths of many key characters. The body count just continues until nobody will be left to sit on the Iron Throne. I must say I like Tyrion Lannister with a beard. After Season 5, one is reminded of the old mafia adage, keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

Now I'm logging in to see that I'm being charged to watch season 5 when it was free up until last night. But I see every other season including number 6 is still free. So I'm wondering what changed and why?? Was there something that was not communicated with the customers?

Others have complained today about the (not free) availability of season 5 after agreeing to the HBO subscription with free first month.  I signed up on 12/27/16, and have been catching up with seasons 4 and 5 since then.  I was able to view all of season 4, and episodes 1-9 of season 5 for free during the past week, however, attempting to watch episode 10 today, I find that there would be a charge for it, and indeed there is a charge for all of season 5 showing up now (though no charge for any of the other seasons).

7104193,3,B00VSG3MSC,"First, since this is a DVD review I'll tell you the extras are probably the best they've ever put on so far in any of the five seasons. The ""Day In The Life"" is so fascinating to see how a day's shoot evolves in three locations of Dubrovnik, Croatia, Sevilla, Spain, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. The other Locations extra is way too poorly lit to really get any gauge on the details they talked about. I just did not get that at all when even on the episode in question it was hard to see the detailing of the set. Having said that the breakdown of the last episode in this season and how they buolt the sets and shot scenes was mindblowing.

The Real History extra is even better than the actual series as we get to learn who all these Game Of Thrones' characters were based on. It's also very confusing that it took five seasons to do this sort of extra.

Finally, Season Five overall was a dull bore until the last three episodes. OK, we're all in if we've watched four seasons and we get the slow pace and weird sudden edits where storylines get cut and not resumed till often episodes later but even for GOT standards, I grew super bored thru most of this till those final three episodes. Honestly, of all the seasons, I'd say this is the one I've liked the least. The whole Dorne storyline went basically nowhere despite the glorious garden and palace settings in actual sunshine and light. The Wall and the North storylines continue to drag on and, frankly, I gave up caring about Jon Snow, the Boltons and Sansa seasons ago. I still don't get if the White Walking Scottish Icelanders just don't hurry up and start the apocalypso. What exactly are they waiting for? Winter has been coming now for five seasons. Get on with it!

Also, if you have dragons--use them. Why does Khaleesie need an army at all? Also, is it just me, but why don't they dye Emilia Clarke's eyebrows blonde as well? It makes zero sense and is so distracting. Then again I find her Halle Berry Storm hair really weird overall.

Anyway, one hopes Season Six will get it going from the start to finish. I'm hooked anyway and will watch till it all pans out but Season Five was mediocre overall.

7104208,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I bought this mainly for the collectible steelbook and magnet.

 MULTIPLE COPIES 
You get three different copies of the series:
1) Blu-ray (physical discs)
2) UltraViolet 1080p HD version (digital copy, HD only available on some devices)
3) iTunes 1080p HD version (digital copy)

The digital code gives you two digital versions (which is rare and appreciated).

 STEELBOOK and MAGNET 
This steelbook has artwork designed by Elastic, the agency that created the Emmy Award-winning opening credits, and has a magnet on the cover that can be removed and used as a regular magnet, or left on to show off as a collector's piece. Each season represents one of the major houses of the series, and this season five steelbook represents the slave city of Meereen, with the House Targaryen sigil on the magnet. The steelbook is in a matching decorative plastic outer case that holds the magnet in place so it doesn't scratch the steelbook. The outer plastic case is thicker than the previous four seasons (which was easy to crack).

 THE SHOW 
The show is greatin acting, in storytelling, in visuals, in music, and in writing. I've watched everything at least three times, and there are so many new things you see when re-watching, and with the knowledge of future episodes.

The fifth season follows the journey of our favorite characters in new settings. Saying any of their names would constitute a spoiler, as you would know who survives, so I'm keeping it vague. One of this season's highlights is the meeting of two strong characters; sparks are instant and the game changes. There are also episodes directed by David Nutter (of The X-Files fame), who directs two very thrilling episodes. Lastly, the finale makes us feel so many feels; it all builds up to something we think we know how we'll react to, but it gets the completely opposite reaction.

I have converted many friends who previously used to think this was about ""dungeons and dragons and lord of the rings,"" (like I did) who are now *all* addicted to the show. If you don't already know, this show isn't about what you think it may be about.

This is currently THE only good show on television, and if you don't like it, you probably don't understand good television (sorry, not sorry). It has been the number one torrented show in every single year since it came out for a reason (which is a blessing and curse for the producers). After watching this, everything else on TV becomes: ""why I am watching all these other crappy shows?""

This is one of those series that I will buy the individual season sets, and whatever big box set comes out in the future. GAME OF THRONES! Recommended.",1479600000,3,2646,4.761487964989059

For me this was the best series yet, with all the now expected GoT specials; epic battles, favourite characters being brutally dispatched, twists in the plot line to keep you guessing where it is all going and some of the more loathsome characters getting their long overdue deserts. The acting and characterisations continue to be excellent and the quality of production remains undiminished. For someone who grew up in the era of black and white TV pictures with wobbling sets the flawless excellence of the CGI scenics is a wonder to behold.

7104377,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I've become a big fan of Game of Thrones.  The early seasons tended to be a bit on the ""risque"" side...  partially because HBO wanted that (to sell a new series people might not ready for) and partly (and appropriately) to point out the DECADENCE of the ""Seven Kingdoms"" and many of the main characters (in all cases, so far, to illustrate how they change over time...  see, for example, Tyrion Lannister)

This may have been the best season of the series so far... and that's saying a lot.  We're finally seeing things coming together... all the prior seasons have been setup, and rising-action, and how we're into the meat of the story.  Which, ultimately, is going to be ""how do the seven kingdoms unite, and thus are able to defeat the White Walkers?""

Well, we see now.  We have had the ""setup"" characters removed, for the most part.  We now see which sides people will fall onto, and we know who is going to sit on the iron throne when it's all said and done.  We know that the ""fire"" in this ""song"" is Dani and her dragons (and while she's going to ride one of them into battle, there are two other dragons who still lack riders...  my guess is that the other riders will be Tyrion and Jon, but time will tell)

At the end of this season, Dani seems to be lost...  but we see that she's going back to her original storyline (which opens up things for some very interesting developments in Season 6).  Jon seems to be ""lost"" as well, but we've seen people come back from the dead in this series before... both in good ways and in bad ones... and never forget, those on the wall never get to leave until they die...  so this is the only way that Jon can leave the wall without being an oathbreaker!

Aria Stark is clearly on a very dark road...  with the questions posed in this season, and how the season ends for her, all about ""who she is"" and more importantly ""who she wants to be.""  I think we can all tell that she won't remain part of the ""faceless men"" sect forever, but she's learning things that will make her a formidable force in the future (whether for good or for evil, though, we can't be certain, can we?)

Sansa Stark's story is very, VERY dark... and has been from the middle of the first season, if you were paying attention.  She's lost all of her innocence now, and while she SEEMS to be on the side of ""good,"" I have strong misgivings about her as well...  I can imagine her eventually becoming a major villain, taking the role  currently filled by ""Littlefinger"" (who I'm convinced is the real ""big bad"" behind everything we've seen go wrong in this series!)

What remains unclear is...  where does Jaimie Lannister fall into the grand scheme of things?  We're being given hints that he may well become one of the major heroes, though I personally suspect he'll simply redeem himself by ridding us of a major threat, sacrificing himself in the bargain.

We see the end of the ""War of the Kings"" this season...  Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Rob Stark, Mance Rayder...  all gone.  There is, once again, only one throne.  And that throne, at this point, is held by a weak, easily manipulated (albeit nice) boy.  We can all see where this is going...  a full-on ""cold war"" between the ""High Sparrow"" and Circe Lannister.  The boy king will not end up in charge in any case, and will undoubtedly be a casualty, regardless of which of the two wins in the end.

Which will set us up for the inevitable ""rising action"" of the Seven Kingdoms, under either the Sparrow or Circe, being invaded by Dani and her newly re-acquired Dothraki hoard, along with all her other forces (including her three dragons).  And then, to the final climactic conflict where the White Walkers will be defeated (and, I presume, they'll start getting annual summers and winters!)",1475712000,,3782,4.487554904831625

Underdogs that make you cheer. I watch this because it is compelling and addicting.,1474761600,,340,5.089285714285714

7104541,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Season 5 is very good. There's a new king (because honestly, what's a GOT season without a new king waiting to be killed by 6 different armies). The power struggles continue between.....well....everyone. While highly entertaining, the whole season does feel like a transition to set up huge changes for season 6.

Arya Stark continues her journey to Braavos to meet the faceless man, in what is one of the most interesting story arcs of the series.

Sansa Stark is FINALLY starting to be an interesting character after laboring through 4 seasons of her expecting everything to just turn out well because she's rich. She's finally realized that there is a 'game' to game of thrones and that she has to play it. (She stinks at playing the game. But at least she's playing it.) Her fate is left unclear.

Oh, and there are finally dragons in this show that is supposed to have a lot of dragons. They don't show up for more than a few seconds until near the end of the season, but when dragons finally show up to do something they do it with a vengeance! It makes the wait for drag action well worth it! And the White Walkers stop being imaginary boogeymen and show up with authority as well.

Overall the production value of the series continues to be insanely high. The sets, the costumes, the props....they all create a visual image so real that by the end of each episode you feel like you just spent an hour in Westeros. The acting adds so much more on top of that, without a single bad player in the cast. The CGI is flawless and blends naturally with the live action and live sets. It doesn't look hokey or ""updated Star Wars"" at all. It's solid use of CGI, which is a refreshing change.

I won't talk about the details about how this season ended, but to call it a cliff hanger is an understatement. Before the credits roll on the final episode you're already excited fro season 6 to start.

Blu Ray is the only way to own this series. Regular DVD just doesn't present the detail that makes this show so phenomenal.

**NO SPOILERS OR PLOT POINTS DISCUSSED**

This review will only be for my opinion of the season overall, and the packaging, extras, and video/audio quality.

Let me start by saying that Game of Thones is one of my favorite shows of all-time. The story is brutal and tragic, yet engrossing and compelling. The characters are wonderfully written, and everything from character motivations to the dialogue and action sequences are superb. The show also has top notch production values, as the environment, props, and wardrobes look magnificent. GOT is a beauty.

The packaging is awesome, as it has been on all of the season blu rays. The discs are in flip book, which go into a sleeve, which has a plastic sleeve over top of it all. This season has gold and brown artwork, which looks lovely. Very happy with the packaging.

All 10 episodes this season are included on 4 blu rays. Extras include in episode guides, histories and lore, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, and a plethora of behind the scenes featurettes.

The episodes look amazing on blu ray. The 1080p really shines on this series, and everything look breathtakingly beautiful. The characters, scenery, wardrobes, etc all look excellent. The 5.1 audio is great too. The score is brilliant and the metal swords and armor clanging sound great. Sound and Video are easy 10/10.

Overall this is another solid season in this great series. I enjoyed every episode, and always recommend this show to anyone I talk to about movies/tv. What else can I say? Game of Thrones gets my highest recommendation, and the blu ray sets are glorious. This is the best show on television, in my humble opinion.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I got bored, and feel as if this whole series is over hyped.  No character ever gets developed, they are constantly swinging from one Id to another to suit that episode director, and just when a promising sub-story starts to brew, the character disappears or dies.  Some of the mainly featured characters are just recycling material and don't go anywhere.",1472169600,,514,4.677777777777778

7104702,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I was ready to let Game of Thrones go after the show's fourth season. From season blocking to episode pacing to writing, Season 4 just chalked up dead end after miss after letdown. A friend's intrepid thumbs-up was enough for me to what-the-heck this one.

I'm glad I did. Amazingly, with far fewer major plot points, Season 5 is as entertaining and thought-provoking as the series' best. I'd argue that modern sci-fi and fantasy is fairly well-populated  all right, played out  but the reveal for the Many-Faced God floored me. Can't remember the last time that happened.

Only one storyline, the sojourn to Dorne, drags Season 4's dull, thin and gazonga-fueled writing along, and there's hardly enough of it to spoil the rest.",1471996800,,728,4.894308943089431

7105366,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Darker and Darker. This show continues on its compelling way. I haven't read beyond the first book so the TV series is completely fresh to me and Im not aware or worried by any diversions from the written source material. As is usual, there are several jawdrop moments punctuating the always high level of action and intrigue. Some of these are very dark even for this show, which has made a point of shocking. A number of characters, also as usual, depart the show in very definite ways. Thankfully at last, some of the more afflicted characters begin to redeem themselves or at least get a sniff of better times. Conversely, there are some major slips of fortune for others. It could be argued that the first half is a little slow but overall this series is as strong as the others. Highlights for me were the scenes of John Snow beyond the Wall, dragon action and anything that Tyrion is in. Some incredible scenarios are set up for Season 6.

7105384,5,B00VSG3MSC,"**NO SPOILERS OR PLOT POINTS DISCUSSED**

This review will only be for my opinion of the season overall, and the packaging, extras, and video/audio quality.

Let me start by saying that Game of Thones is one of my favorite shows of all-time. The story is brutal and tragic, yet engrossing and compelling. The characters are wonderfully written, and everything from character motivations to the dialogue and action sequences are superb. The show also has top notch production values, as the environment, props, and wardrobes look magnificent. GOT is a beauty.

The packaging is awesome, as it has been on all of the season blu rays. The discs are in flip book, which go into a sleeve, which has a plastic sleeve over top of it all. This season has gold and brown artwork, which looks lovely. Very happy with the packaging.

All 10 episodes this season are included on 4 blu rays. Extras include in episode guides, histories and lore, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, and a plethora of behind the scenes featurettes.

The episodes look amazing on blu ray. The 1080p really shines on this series, and everything look breathtakingly beautiful. The characters, scenery, wardrobes, etc all look excellent. The 5.1 audio is great too. The score is brilliant and the metal swords and armor clanging sound great. Sound and Video are easy 10/10.

Overall this is another solid season in this great series. I enjoyed every episode, and always recommend this show to anyone I talk to about movies/tv. What else can I say? Game of Thrones gets my highest recommendation, and the blu ray sets are glorious. This is the best show on television, in my humble opinion.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The white walkers show up at one point out of nowhere in the season with one of the most visually impressive TV battles ever. There's a few shocking moments. Some characters pay for their crimes and others are betrayed for doing the moral thing. Classic ""Game of thrones"". My only complaint is the Dorne storyline. I won't spoil.

Basically, this season's arc is the how-we-got-here for season 6, which is all sorts of crazy-awesome. Best scenes I can recall (after some delicious post-work beers) include two key scenes -- Tyrion and Daenerys have a face-to-face civil chat that is actually a chess game for survival and dominance -- and the last episode with Jon Snow (just watch it).

The White Walkers army of doom, the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce!), the Walk of Attonement...lots of good in this season that really is a set-up for the next season.",1466035200,,713,4.788617886178862

7105621,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Look, if you don't know what Game of Thrones is, then you probably wouldn't be reading this, and if you do know what Game of Thrones is, then this review will not change your view of the show.  That being said this is perhaps one of the richest, most complex, deeply thought out and intricate television series/movies/book series EVER!

It almost requires a notebook and a syllabus to follow along all the storylines, intrigue, and characters.  The story's are separate yet intertwined over time and distance and the folklore created for this show is similar yet so far beyond Tolkien and Arthurian legends.  When you think you've gotten a handle on the this show, the show constantly throws curve balls at you.

I'm writing this on a Wednesday.  Four days from now episode 9 of the current season will air.  This is the episode where dramatic things typically take place and I cant wait.. Its been a long time since I've been this excited and nervous about a show or series or movie.

7105775,5,B00VSG3MSC,"As it progresses, the TV series becomes better than the books (sorry, I had to say it)
I read and enjoyed the first three books in the series. when the HBO Series first became available on Amazon I was in the midst of book 3.

I went on to read book 4 ""A feast for crows"" and was so disappointed that I gave up the book series entirely and never watched the HBO Series.

well, I recently finally gave the series a try and was delighted I did.
Even while recounting the books I enjoyed, I was pleased with the production of the HBO Series and their adoption of the material.
when it came to the time period covered in ""A Feat for Crows,"" The series beat the book by miles! HBO Did a fantastic job fixing the train wreck that Martin made of that period in his book series.

7105966,1,B00VSG3MSC,"I don't know how to rate this, but I'm giving it 1 star because it is so unsatisfying. Keeps diverging from the books in stupid, unlikely ways -- and the books are already largely an unpleasant story about unpleasant people. (Or, to quote someone else, George Martin seems to hate his readers.)

Technically, the television show is well done, but it is largely good acting in support of a bad story. In the end, it is a wretched show to watch despite all the things they do well.

Also, the use of nudity on the show seldom advances the story. It doesn't bother me, but it's largely prurient.",1464480000,,592,4.472222222222222

7106027,5,B00VSG3MSC,"As someone familiar with uk tv productions for decades  I can write that this may be the best tv movie/series ever. A lot of this quality is due to the sheer length of the project but much is also the result of top notch casting and an exceptional screenplay.  The cruelty that is always around the corner is not gratuitous but more a part of the rough standards of the societies shown . The many surprise twists in the story are believeable  and for the most part are evidence of the depravity of human nature.  BUT there are shortcoming as well. Too many times the flow of events is farr fetched. Perhaps the first and possibly the most evident is that the young dragons were not taken or killed when the opportunity was at hand. The endless nudity is offensive, the many times when people pop up at just the last moment to save the day reminds me of  30's/40's serials  and the cast changes are , except for Van Sydow,  a step downward.  Strangely the character of most interest, is the dwarf . The actor in this role is also the most accomplished in the cast.  All told  a long story plotted with maybe eight different  scenarios  that fit together seamlessly.
So far there is little that can be thought to be predictable and that's good.  Best that this continues to the end.",1464307200,,1280,4.418803418803419

7106261,4,B00VSG3MSC,"I  am not really fond of this show. I watch it because it is a good way to have a regular, weekly get-together with my friends and neighbors who really like it. I tire of not being able to trust so many people. I do enjoy the actors themselves but I find there are too many characters to keep track of, and we all often forget which,  which is which. I find I can't attach to anyone because they might get killed off at any moment. I have enjoyed this season more than the others since the plot seems a bit more solidified and the characters more stabilized. Of course, I resent some beloved characters getting killed off, and I really tire of all the stupid nudity that is clearly just gratuitous. I also have to note that it is pretty sexist. The women are frequently (and I do mean frequently) completely nude, while the men are rarely so, and very briefly. I find it incredibly annoying and, actually, pretty sickening. This season, so far as I have seen, has a lot less nudity and more intriguing storyline.",1463356800,,1012,4.377659574468085

7106276,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I Bought the HD version of season 5 for my Kindle . I felt that I invested wisely in my purchase, Plot development of episodes had a connective thread which kept my attention and made me feel for the characters. For example, I never thought I would feel sympathy for Cersei Lannister in the final episode of season 5 when she went through of her walk of atonement before the High Sparrow.,Loved the first episode which featured Maggie the Cat and her prophecy of  misery for the House of Lannister.",1463270400,,498,4.533333333333333

Acting: engaging and excellently cast.
Story: just the right mix of suspense, fantasy, drama and reality mixed with ""I'm going to kill your favorites but that 3% chance we might not keeps you watching.""
Costumes and filming: artfully fitting with beautiful colors creating moods that evoke the senses.
Special effects: not bad! Although, I am old school and would normally prefer animatronics and people in costume and makeup.
Bottom line: of you miss this season or series. You'll have cultural nightmares and be laughed out of party conversations. Forever. Think about it.",1463097600,,707,5.103448275862069

7106342,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I'm not going to speak on the content of the product itself, as many other reviewers have done some with great detail. I'm more concerned my first (of two) purchases of this product, which appears to be counterfeit.

A list of things to watch out for when buying:

-The exterior blue where it says Blu Ray on the outside was the wrong tone, and did not also say Digital HD, vs the real copy which did.
-The slipcase artwork paper shows color banding and indicates it is a reprint, not the original printer quality.
-The inner guide booklet is clearly reprinted - the words are muddier and less clear - and on cheaper paper.
-The inner paperwork did not include the ultraviolet paperwork, or any other HBO or George R. R. Martin merchandise insets.
-The clear disc cases don't match the other seasons - rounded corners, the Blu Ray logo is in the wrong place, etc.
-The discs themselves have muddy or hard to read and misaligned print on them. The reflective cutouts of the letters don't match the printed letters.
-The discs are clearly burned discs - you can see the circle of burned data and area of blank data on the disc. Real discs show all silver on the bottom and are pressed, not burned.
-The actual content on the discs is shrunk - an episode (pull it up with a tool on the PC) is normally 10-14 GB. Episodes 9 & 10 of my fake were 6-7 GB each.
-The fake Blu Rays did not include either any AACS protection or lower than it should be - the licensed proprietary digital encryption of the Blu Rays. Season 3 was AACS 42, Season 4 was AACS 50, and Season 5 on the proper copy is AACS 57. The fake was not AACS 57.

Please watch out for third party sellers. They themselves may not even know their product is fake. My vendor has a 100% satisfactory rating, and the product is new as of this posting, so likely whoever sold it to him is the one at fault, but I can't say for certain. I am returning that copy after I take comparative photos of the two sets, and my second one came directly from Amazon, 100% fine.

I really look forward to each episode! I love this series! I read the books first and the episodes follow pretty close to the book.  The actors are terrific and it's really great that they have been able to keep the same actors from season to season. Watching them grow up is just how it goes n the books. I thought there were only 5 books though. I see that there is another Season on TV, Season 6. If there are only 5 books did they cut the last book in half so that they could make an extra season? Maybe someone can tell me that. I would appreciate it. Can NOT wait for the next book. What's taking so long???",1462233600,,762,4.0131578947368425

Then from week to week even with the review of the previous week it still is confusing.  We paid for season 5 to review the shows in one seating. This makes it a little clearer to understand.  The writing is better than most of the net work channel shows. Where so often it a challenge or game show very uninteresting.  Please continue to bradcast theses types of programs.

7106739,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Excellent. My main concern is that Hbo and Stars, the best for great series, will not release to Amazon series like Game of Thrones. Since they now have their own gig of just purchasing their content by subscribing with them, I am concerned I will not be able to utilize my prime to watch these shows. I could be wrong, but an example would be Homeland. I have to sign up with Starz to use the prime.

7106779,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Season 5 is fabulous - this HBO series just gets more exciting every season.  I loved George RR Martin's books in this series - and this is one of the few examples I have ever seen of a not only successful, but fabulous translation from book to screen.  Warning:  it is HBO, and so there is full frontal nudity, sexual scenes, cursing, and occasional violence and gore, as well as scary monsters, so it is NOT appropriate for children.  One more adult privilege they can choose when they grow up!",1461715200,,496,4.477777777777778

7106850,5,B00VSG3MSC,One of those shows you hate to finish a season because you know how badly you're going to miss it while you're waiting for the next season. Clearly one of the most riveting shows out there today. I have not anticipated anything coming out this much since each and every one of the JRR Tolkien movies. When's the next season coming out ?,1461542400,,336,4.349206349206349

7106866,3,B00VSG3MSC,"I'm gradually coming to realize that this show is a soap opera.  The first three seasons were amazing, but now it's dragged on long enough that I don't really care what happens to the characters anymore.  If I get the next season, I probably won't be paying extra for Blu-Ray as it isn't worth the extra money, and hassle (can't play blu-ray on pc without extra software).",1461542400,,372,4.537313432835821

7106868,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I am a fan of the show and realize it is not for everyone especially if you do not like a lot of violence.  Nothing really ends very happily in this series  but watching the levels some characters go to to hold and keep what they assume to be the ultimate power is very intriguing. There is a whole lot of characters in this series and costuming and settings are quite good.  One liners delivered mostly by Tyrion usually gives me a chuckle but they can be few and far between.  I do enjoy the series though and continue to watch because I am very curious as to what happens next and who and  how will the throne be won, and of course what is up with those white walkers.",1461542400,3,671,4.130769230769231

We love GOT, but hope the next season we will actually be able to hear at a normal level.",1461110400,,393,3.6
7106974,2,B00VSG3MSC,"Just started watching GOT about 3 weeks ago. Bought all five seasons and binge watched the whole series. Enjoyed all five seasons but season five disappointed me.

The series is atypical in storytelling in that the antagonists and protagonists are all shades of gray, rather than being white hats and black hats like in typical western stories. The good guys and bad guys in GOT are all flawed characters to certain extents.

I get that about the series. They've killed off virtuous, even heroic characters throughout all the seasons (Ned Stark, Rob Stark, Renly Baratheon, etc.) If you're going to watch GOT you have to expect this to happen.

Season five, however, seemed to add a sadism to this trait. In previous seasons the death, destruction and violence usually moved the story forward. Season five had a number of events that didn't seem to do anything other than fill space and deliberately afflict the most virtuous characters in the series. Much of it seemed gratuitous.

The dragon queen, arguably the most virtuous character of all the kings, becomes suddenly mired in a political morass that doesnt seem to do anything to move the story forward. Same thing with the new king Tommen. After the satisfying death of Joffrey, the new king is similarly embroiled in a weird power play with a fringe cult who emprisons his wife, her brother, and his mother Cersei. Again, whats the point? Other than to irritate the audience. It all feels contrived and parked in place as filler. Perhaps the following seasons will pull these stories together

Three of the most virtuous characters all get badly beat up, for no reason. Sansa Stark is used and abused to the point that the scene was almost impossible to watch. Shireen Baratheon was burned at the stake. Sorry watching a little girl being burned didn't advance the story enough to warrant the image they filmed. Another scene not watched.

And of course, Jon Snow. The one character that most of the audience is invested in and they stab him to death at the end of the season. Again, after all he had been through to kill him in such an empty manner seems pointless. We can only hope that this is a dream, or perhaps a vision that Bran is having, and they didn't actually kill their best man.

Having said all that, episode eight is perhaps the best single episode of the entire series. The last 20 minutes of that episode could well become as iconic in television as Lucy in the chocolate factory, Who shot JR and the final episode of MASH.

Looking forward to season six, I hope the pace of the series finds it way back into the same gear it had in earlier seasons.",1461110400,,2625,4.666666666666667

7106982,4,B00VSG3MSC,"I found the ten episodes of Season 5 to be less entertaining than the previous seasons.  Season 5 didn't have a wow didn't see that coming moment like all the previous seasons did.  Possibly because a lot of the main ruthless people had been killed of in previous seasons leaving the main two outwitting ones, pretty much just taking a break in the last city taken in last season or hidden away in a shipping crate, or chained to a boat for most of these episodes.  The season did get better for the last couple of episodes, although allowing a certain scene with Drogon to be released as multiple toys long before this season itself on DVD meant, we all knew that was coming at some stage.  I have to say I thought  the visuals of that would be better than they were.  Can I also ask the marketers of this show that Season 6 be released on DVD before we start promoting season 7 as a subscribe to our pay TV channel, as we knew some of the main characters who obviously survived, again before this was even released on DVD when the commercials started.  The main enjoyment is not knowing if any character will be alive from one second to the next.

There are some interesting extras on the DVDs, besides audio commentaries on each episode and a few deleted scenes on the last disc, there is also a couple of making of features where we see this being shot simultaneously in a number of different countries.  We see the final episode's major scenes being shot and no doubt a lot of effort went into filming this thing.  But for me most of this season 5 was like filler songs on a CD, there watchable but you're waiting for something great to happen that just never does.  It looks like we'll have to wait for it to happen in Season 6.",1461110400,,1734,4.337461300309598

In a few cases, I liked where the series went better than the books.
One thing I noticed in this season, the use of the 'F' word. Seemed every other word was that word...why?
Do you really think folks from that 'age' or 'place' would even know what that word was? Its a shame when someone feels that the only way to
tell their story it to fill it with language such as that. There is no reason.

The fact that George is bold enough to include what the basis of human nature is in his work and not holding back just shows the reason why censorship is a major hinderance on originality and creativity.

7107054,5,B00VSG3MSC,"My review is specific regarding a problem I encountered when trying to access the commentary tracks of the episodes. Never had a problem playing the commentary tracks for any other Blu-ray title, among dozens of others. I tried changing to the commentary track during playing of each episode using the menu, tried selecting it from the menu before playback - nothing worked.

For those owners of the ""Game of Thrones: Season 5 Blu-ray"" who have an issue of being unable to access the commentary tracks on the Blu-ray episodes, the solution for my particular BD player, an OPPO BDP-103 came from OPPO's tech support: ""If the Audio Commentary tracks are to be played over the normal audio, then before inserting the disc you will need to set Secondary Audio to ON under Audio Format Setup. Please note that this will lower the quality of audio (in general) from Blu-rays, so you will want to disable it when not in use.""

This solved the problem for my Blu-ray player, which by default had the Secondary Audio set to 'OFF'. The commentary tracks are definitely on the discs, as I've now listened to several entire episodes with the various writers, directors, and actors sharing their experiences.

Checking to see if your Blu-ray player's Secondary Audio feature is 'ON' in the player's setup may be the solution for those that encounter a problem accessing the episode commentary. Oddly, I didn't need this player feature enabled for any of the dozens of other Blu-ray titles with commentary tracks just to hear them.

The ""Game of Thrones: Season 5 Blu-ray"" is another good addition to my library but the way the discs were authored seems a bit unconventional compared with many other Blu-ray movies I own. Not sure why they just didn't have the commentary as an ordinary alternate audio track, rather than a Second Audio type of track.",1460764800,,1837,4.840764331210191

They origionally took, a great book(s), stuck to it closely, had quality doalogue, storylines, and plots, with many powerful actors, and gained world wide success and fame.  Now, of course after success, they  threw all,of that out the window.

They completely  Recreated the story line, ( unfortunately,) ,  tossed,out the book story , that works! ...stuck to the American cliche zombie, sex and violence themes, threw out all biting, intelligent, witty, thoughtful, creative dialogue, acting, and stories, and relied soley on disturbing child violence , nudity, rape, burning at the stake, a whole ephosodes (wasted) of zombies.... (We can see that on amy other channel) none of which are in the book.  They completely left out the whole story line of the capture of Tirian and that side story...

Sad.

7107127,1,B00VSG3MSC,"Waste of my time and worst decline in storytelling I have ever paid for.  I knew they were going to move beyond the books this season and they sure did, right into gratuitous violence, boring characters, badly written plot lines, cheap thrills and bad acting galore.  Maybe fit for a twelve year old sadist, but not a style of story telling I am willing to spend another season on.  I am beyond disappointed.  I am done with this series.  Maybe George R R will write another book but honestly at this point his characters are so ruined and the storylines so destroyed....well I hope he is enjoying the revenue.

7107147,3,B00VSG3MSC,"I must admit that I liked what I saw...but that's just it.  I only gave this DVD 3 stars because the season was way too short and felt like filler at times.  I thought the wait and the cost was too much for so few episodes.  I ended up disappointed because nothing happened, nothing happened, then something happened, then the season was done.  Its like they are still setting up for the next piece of the story and I've seen much too much of that already.  In the end, we are still waiting for Winter, still waiting for the battle for the Iron Throne, still waiting for all the players to take action.

This doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy parts of the season, like the dragons and the fights and the strange world of the House that Arya has entered into in Bravos and Sansa Stark's homecoming to Winterfell and the wonderful Dead battle and the shock of the season finale and what happens when people let religious nut jobs get power and weapons.  But the season just felt all over the place and like it was the middle part of a trilogy that was only paving the way for the next season.  Nothing much really got resolved and some plots weren't even included in this season.

I've loved past seasons, but now I have to wait again...after just a taste and I found that very irritating.  What there was of the show was good, but that's it...it felt like everything was left up in the air and two storylines that actually resolved (such as it was) left a bad taste and didn't make much sense.  I won't say whose storylines, but this show does delight in killing off main characters...nuff said.",1459296000,2,1593,4.402730375426621

7107197,5,B00VSG3MSC,"I will not spoil any of the main season plot points, but there may be some spoilers from prior seasons.

Season 5 was another great season, but in a way much of the material could have been put off until season 6. Based on the parts of the story that were left out in prior seasons (like the Lady Stoneheart arc) and the fact that Bran's story line was not shown at all in season 5, the show ends up caught up to the 5th book in the series, and will get ahead of the books once it goes into season 6, and depending on how quickly George Martin writes, will probably still be ahead in season 7. I think most people see the books and the show as two separate entities by now, and realize that with all the major changes the show has made, it is telling a similar overall story, but different detailed story to what the books are telling. Chances are if you have accepted that in prior seasons you will accept it this season, and if it bothered you in seasons 1-4, it will bother you this season as well.

Like the prior seasons the show tells multiple stories over the 10 episode season, with some story lines intertwining (like Stannis's continued attempt at a power grab ultimately colliding with both the Castle Black/Wildling/White Walker story, and Sansa's return to Winterfell). Cerci develops a plan to keep as much power from the Tyrells as possible, which ultimately backfires on her and leads to a major season 5 storyline and sets up her story for season 6 very well. There is also a large focus on Arya finally reaching the House of Black and White. The show does a great job navigating each of the story lines, giving enough attention to each one while still managing the overall story forward. There is also the first Lannister Tygerion meeting which is forshadowed on the box of the DVD/Blu-Ray set. It is impossible to go into much detail without spoiling to much, but it is well done, and again sets up those characters for the next season.

The season ends on a few different cliffhangers. Most likely know what they are by now, but again I will not spoil them. Needless to say the fates of more than one character hangs in the balance and there are of course the requisite killing off (or potential killing off) of main characters again which has been a staple of the show from the first season. The acting, directing and writing are all very well done. The show does a good job of continuing to mix practical sets with great CGI shots to make it one of the most visually stunning shows on T.V. at the moment. Like in the prior seasons there is a lot of violence and nudity, but nothing that has not been seen before.

For those who get the actual discs, besides looking and sounding great, they include a lot of extras. There are in episode guides for all the episodes, commentary tracks with combinations of filmmakers and actors or crew on most episodes, deleted scenes and a couple hours worth of behind the scenes material. A lot there for those who like to go through the bonus features.",1459123200,3,3010,4.447463768115942

7107206,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Whether or not you loved this season, the Bluray version is objectively the best way to watch this. You can spend $15 right now and binge all the seasons including this season on HBO Now, and even share your password with family (HBO carefully treads around whether this is OK or not) so they can watch it. But here's why the Bluray works best:

1. The least compressed picture. Digital versions of this season on HBO Now, iTunes and Google Play are smaller files streamed from the internet, and the picture has visible banding, artifacts and noise. This Bluray is extremely clean, crystal clear and the best quality picture you can get.

2. Lossless audio. The entire audio experience is amped up, and even includes support for Dolby Atmos. I personally noticed much cleaner dialogue than the HBO Go streams I watched when the season was airing. Some effects like the banging of hammers and birds chirping in Winterfell were great with my 5.1 setup. The audio quality is an even bigger step up from digital which sometimes is stereo only, or a compressed 5.1 depending on the service and the hardware you are watching shows through.

3. Not dependent on your internet speeds. If you have a lower speed internet, digital streams further lose picture and audio quality to the point where it looks like a standard DVD if not worse.

4. Special features like the Game of Thrones lore feature voiced by the actors in character are really excellent. There are usually over a dozen 2 to 4 minute animated sequences that cover parts of the universe that need to be fleshed out. You can learn more about Robert's Rebellion, The Targaryens, The History of Winterfell and much much more.

There's a bunch more features and things to discover in the Bluray itself, but I just covered the points that mattered to me. If you love Game of Thrones and have a super nice TV with great speakers, you can't go wrong picking this up.",1459123200,,1914,4.667655786350148

There are plenty of stellar moments, the highlight being the Battle of Hardhome, which wasn't in the book, but was easily one of the best fights to ever grace the screen.
The showrunners did a good job of cutting the fat from the bloated source material, and made a lean and mean adaptation. Can't recommend it enough.",1458691200,,451,4.512195121951219

There's some exciting action in the last 3 episodes, but it's ultimately hollow and leads nowhere.  You could skip this whole season and miss nothing.  Some people die, but so what.  Some people live, but so what.  It's all meaningless now.  Don't get too attached to anything because it could turn on a dime for no reason. It seems like all the strong characters have been killed off already.  Sometimes it's not bad, but it's never really great.  I couldn't binge this, I had to watch it in short gasps, sometimes only half an episode at a time.  I'm trying to stay in the Game, but it's getting really hard.

7107253,1,B00VSG3MSC,"Quickly here, despite the snobbery of fanboys this is one thing only Entertainment. Thats it. We were not entertained in a positive way. My Wife and I loved it all until this season. One fantastic episode with the battle, but the rest really seemed like we were being strung along, first time I've thought they are aware this is a cash cow and to go on and on and on and on (I wonder if the publisher pushes the author to drag it out too for the books, keep the income stream going, your conscious of watching ""filler"" after a while it can get so boring). My Wife and I are addicted to this show, but we were both very very disappointed here, just felt like filler and some of the actions of key players are so so out of character, just to join dots, when we mere watchers notice this, you just know its lazy writing. Oh, and really angered me who died at the end. Getting sick of seeing great characters being killed off cheaply after so much investment (and new ones are not worthy substitues), this one being my fave, I thought he'd be there to the end. You can see fans getting more and more frustarted as more and more top loved characters are taken out. It's like JK Rowling killing off Ron or Hermoine in DeathLY hALLOWS, I'm sure she thought of it, but why give your readers and fans a bad experience? why? Really really unsatisfying, to go through slow slow talky talky filler (one fantastic episode near the end, the battle) to be left with a thoroughly unsatisfying end. If they kill the little one I'm done, and how can you turn the Mother of Dragons boring?",1458518400,6,1570,4.343537414965986

7107260,4,B00VSG3MSC,"Alright lets be clear about this the entire series to date is not just an outstanding story but the special effects are breath taking. Each season progressively gets better and season 5  is quite outstanding.
This said I think it is quite disgusting that HBO entertainments should rip the paying public off the way that they have been doing.
Only 10 episodes in a season compared with other quite outstanding productions such as Once upon a Time.....Stargate Atlantis to name only a few. Yet these later productions come with 20 plus episodes in a season and the BluRay pricing is somewhat cheaper. I paid $NZ70 for ten episode of season 5 Game of Thrones compared with $NZ65 for twenty episode of Once Upon a Time and StarGate Atlantis. This is a rip off on a gross scale by HBO entertainments. I may be wrong but I believe there are another six seasons of Game of Thrones to come. It occurred to me that in six years time some people may not be alive to see the conclusion of this series. That being said please be aware HBO entertainments that no matter how good or exciting your new future projects are the Game of Thrones will most definitely be the last time that you rip me off.",1458518400,,1185,4.486111111111111

I was a year late getting it on DVD, so I already knew about some of the spoilers.
Everyone was up in arms about the rape of Sansa Stark, yet nobody seemed to be bothered by the fact that Shireen was killed by her own father being blindsided by religion!
Did I miss something here ?
In the dark ages women were sold to men to do with as they pleased ( in some places they still are) and Sansa had the option to get out - she declined .
Shireen (who did not have a choice) was burned at the stake- by her father, no less -yet I did not hear a peep about that atrocity. Are we as a country so steeped in religion that this is acceptable?",1458086400,,685,3.8652482269503547
7107306,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Could this be the big build up to the final season? I hope not. I want more, more, more. Most of what this season contains was unpredictable, horrible, but most enjoyable. Novelist, George Martin, completely throws out the rule book and kills off beloved characters, lets the bad guys win... at least some of the time, and gives women something to do. It parallels real life themes though, so it never strays off into complete fantasy.

I had heard that the 9th episode is the big action one so that the 10th can pull things back together. Not so with this season. There are surprises throughout. Episode 8 was pretty intense, but I still have to give it to episode 9 as the big shocker.

You'd never guess from the first season where we'd be now. Nobody has ended up anywhere near where they started. Most are not even still around. It's been a really adventurous ride. Visually too! The scenery is absolutely stunning. I started out not particularly interested in GoT because I thought the characters were all despicable. Now I can't get enough.",1458086400,2,1047,4.654054054054054

I had to stop reading the books because they got downright depressing, losing much of the humor that balanced the death and misery. I hope the show doesn't follow suit and become a parade of blackly depressing studies in unremitting misery. If that happens, I'm gone.

Series 5 sees Daenerys Targaryen continue to grow in power which is not going unnoticed by those in Westeros. Elsewhere, Jon Snow faces some major changes on the wall and Aryr Stark continues on her quest for revenge.",1458000000,,437,4.675324675324675

7107337,4,B00VSG3MSC,"I hate to give only 4 stars, but is becoming obvious that the story is unraveling. The layered richness of previous episodes seems much less so, with emphasis on events that seem to be stretched to fill time, while other veins are totally unexplored.
I personally believe that Mr. Martin ran out of ideas a long time ago and has no idea how to end the epic. He released a prequel-instead of the next book in GOT-which speaks volumes (sorry).. I also believe that the screen writers have written a good deal of the episodes, and will have to write the remainder of the story. This will not be a bad thing at all, as they seem to be quite capable.
Even so, this series bests most anything in recent memory, so let's hope that the writers are allowed to finish this at the same extraordinary level at which it began.",1457740800,2,813,4.3907284768211925

My friends and I have what we call ""Marathon Weekends"" which are basically grown-up girl slumber parties at various destinations, lots of great food -n- drink and back to back episodes of Game Of Thrones. However, Im not very patient so I really love that I can buy the entire season on Amazon, and get each episode as soon as it is aired.

7107372,3,B00VSG3MSC,"Game of Thrones can't be faulted for some of its shocking developments vis a vis the characters we love because it follows the books fairly closely (with one exception in this season). And George R.R. Martin shows a penchant for cruelty and sexual violence, and an aesthetic that doesn't shield us of from the realities of war, nor does it follow the fantasy tropes and happy outcomes that viewers expect from a fiction. But I found these episodes particularly hard to bear for reasons that can't be disclosed without spoilers for those who haven't seen it (remarkably, I've put it off for almost a year). Essentially, the bleak outlook that Martin claims is life in the Middle Ages (yes, I'm a medievalist) makes for political and historical commentary; as *entertainment* it caters just a little too much to fans who are morbidly interested in some of its imagery of humiliation and violence. As art, it is an interesting departure. Peter Dinklage, as usual, is brilliant. And so is Lena Hedley, a very brave and excellent actor. The quality of the download in its crispness and detail is superior. Thank you, Amazon.",1456876800,,1119,4.863874345549738

7107556,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Game of Thrones is a very intense and intertwined plot adult story. It withholds little, visually. I have become hooked on it and anxiously await next season to start in April 2016. I recommend it, provided you can handle the graphic violence and the not-so-hidden sex scenes. Because  this can be highly offensive to many, you should warn your audiences of this rawness in they have not seen the series before. Once you get into it, the storyline is strong enough to overcome the special effects. If you can get by those issues, I recommend it as an ""on the edge of your seat"" series of stories.",1454630400,,596,4.570093457943925

Season was full of cliff hangers, and some BIG emotional ""wows"" (since I haven't read the books!) that the wait to go over the season again, has made it worse for that alone!  What's up with all the control??? So, I went thru the HBO-GO fiasco, what a joke! I went thru the Amazon Prime streaming download, which was better, until about halfway through, then it was rebuffer city, word, pause....word....pause!! Lol!  Asked for my money back.....Now have to wait til March 15th!?!?  Geez, this is ridiculous!
Anyway, yeah, I gave Season 5, Five Stars just cause I'm a Big fan, who is going through (still) withdrawals!  I miss my fav show.  I used to be (due to major back surgeries) a World of Warcraft player, but now it's G o T for me....and this is CrAzY.....",1454544000,,968,4.528735632183908

I recommend the books  to those who want more detail when it comes to story lines and characters that are not given enough air time on the show.

7107710,4,B00VSG3MSC,"Much will be written about the fifth season of Game of Thrones in the months and years to come. This was always going to be the season in which George R.R. Martin's novels and David Benioff and D.B. Weiss's TV show were going to dramatically diverge from one another, the near-inevitable result of both the needs of dramatisation (which would likely not bear the introspection and subtlety of the fourth and fifth books in the series) and the fact that the TV show is now outpacing the books, requiring both outright invention on the part of the producers as well as drawing on elements from books as-yet unreleased, or even unwritten.

This process has mixed results. In some cases, the adaptation continues to hit its sweet spot of getting complex stories from the novels across on screen in a simpler form, but one that is also clearer, more concise and retaining the thematic essentials whilst paring away unnecessary (if still interesting) supporting material and characters. King's Landing particularly benefits from this, with lots of minor politics involving new or vanishingly minor characters swept aside in favour of a more ruthless focus on Cersei's growing hatred of the Tyrells and the arrival of the High Sparrow, played with flawless passion by Jonathan Pryce. This culminates in the excellent, distressing ""Walk of Shame"" sequence, in which Lena Headey knocks it out of the park as Cersei is humiliated to the point where even the most hardened viewer may feel sorry for her, despite her many crimes.

Almost as well-handled (until its conclusion) is the story at the Wall. Lots of minor crises within the Night's Watch are jettisoned in favour of Jon Snow being given a more decisive story arc: becoming Lord Commander, leading a fleet to rescue the wildlings, getting in over his head at the Battle of Hardhome and then being forced to flee but at least having secured a new alliance.

Then we have the infamous Dornish storyline. This is botched, and botched quite badly. It's a waste of both superlative casting (Alexander Siddig is fantastic, but doesn't have much to do) and beautiful scenery (the result of Spain being added to the shooting locations), with the show delivering the feeblest fight sequence in its history, some of the most risible dialogue and, in the relationship between Tyene Sand and Bronn, who is old enough to be her grandfather, some of its most cringe-inducing flirting (despite the heroic efforts of both actors). There are moments where you can see why the producers thought it was a good idea, such as the ""reasonable"" negotiations between Jaime and Doran and the final scene with Jaime and Myrcella, but it could be argued that the producers should have followed their first instincts and simply not gone to Dorne at all. The fact that the story is also missing its key scene from the books (the one that made the whole story in the books make sense) also hurts it badly.

Then we have Meereen and the Winterfell/Stannis situation, which can both be described as ""problematic"". The Meereen story is simplified from the books, which might be a good thing, with less interchangeable characters, less factions and less politics involving minor tertiary characters. However, the TV series fails to replace these elements with anything more interesting. Instead we have repeated (and redundant) scenes of the Sons of the Harpy slaughtering curiously ineffectual Unsullied by the dozen and repeated (and redundant) scenes of Daenerys musing on opening the fighting pits or not. There are some golden moments here, such as a long-awaited meeting finally happening and the final, epic showdown in the Great Pit, but otherwise it's a story left spinning its wheels for too long.

The Winterfell story is even more variable. Combining the wildly disparate and disjointed Brienne, Sansa, Theon and Ramsay arcs from the novels into one storyline that fuses them together is a bold move and one that actually makes sense and almost works. It is sabotaged by again benching characters for long periods (Brienne's Season 5 storyline can be summed up as ""The Woman Who Stared At Masonry""), running roughshod over motivations (Littlefinger seems uncharacteristically uninformed and stupid) and introducing controversy for controversy's sake (the ending to the sixth episode). Excellent acting by all involved does elevate the story and some scenes are genuinely brilliant. Roose Bolton's matter-of-fact recounting of Ramsay's conception seems to disturb even the unflappably demented Ramsay, whilst Alfie Allen sells Theon's internal struggle to become his old self again with tragic intensity. Sophie Turner also rises above some questionable story twists to deliver some of her finest moments in the role of Sansa to date.

However, it is Stannis's storyline that walks off with the prize for the most howl-inducingly frustrating. Since his introduction in Season 2, the show's depiction of the character has suffered in comparison to the novels, where he is one of Martin's most subtle and complex characters. His motivations are simple on the surface but more complex underneath and he is a character that is determined more by bad PR than reality (the common observation that Stannis humourless is undercut by occasional, very dry almost-quips). Fleetingly, the TV show has shown the same character such as during his determination at the Blackwater and in his first meeting with Jon Snow. But it's not until Season 5 that it seems to nail his character: correcting the grammar of the Night's Watch, nodding approvingly over Jon Snow's leadership tactics and being more fatherly with his daughter. Of course, it was a trap, all done to make his preposterous and utterly unconvincing about-heel turn towards the end of the ninth episode all the more painful to watch. Stephen Dillane was superb in the role, but it does feel like the TV show's producers and writers fundamentally misunderstood the character throughout the series and delivered a highly inconsistent and illogical substitute.

Almost as disappointing is the end to Jon Snow's storyline. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon gradually sends away his most experienced men to man the other castles on the Wall, inadvertently removing the Night's Watch officers who were at the Fist of the First Men and fought the White Walkers there. This leaves behind a cabal of men who haven't seen the true threat from the north and whom it feels convincing would be sceptical of their commander. In the TV series this does not happen, and Castle Black has many rangers present who have just seen thousands of corpses rise from the dead and the White Walkers themselves in the full terrible majesty of their power. The notion that the Watch would continue to question Jon under such circumstances is laughable, not helped by one climactic moment being staged in a manner more befitting Monty Python. Poor stuff.

There are other moments in the fifth season of Game of Thrones when it feels like the show is dealing with pure myth: the voyage through the ruins of Valyria is a genuinely awe-inspiring moment of magic that would do Tolkien proud and the Battle of Hardhome is the best action sequence conceived for the series so far, a full-on zombie rumble that would do Sam Raimi proud and which blows every single zombie action sequence in five seasons of The Walking Dead completely out of the water. The depiction of Braavos is pretty good, and the scenes in the House of Black and White are creepy. The scenes with the dragons are amazing, the more frequent use of CGI establishing shots gives the show a sense of scale that favourably compares with the best films and the production values remain jaw-dropping. The show still has the best cast on television. It remains, even in its weakest moments, watchable.

But there's also the feeling that the fifth season is a little too disjointed, more willing to lean on lazy coincidence and cliche than previous seasons. There's also a distressing lack of attention to detail, with Dorne's location on the title sequence map not being quite right, Jon Snow's fleet apparently landing on the wrong side of the Wall and the plausible military side of things being completely thrown out the window (if Stannis was really a master tactician, he would never do the things he does in the finale).

The fifth season of Game of Thrones is the weakest to date, delivering some of the worst moments and episodes, but it still manages to shine with some real moments of dramatic power. It certainly leaves things in an interesting place going forwards, even if it feels implausible that this huge story (even the TV show's truncated version) can be wrapped up in just thirty more episodes. But we will see how the sixth season handles things next year.",1451088000,47,8773,4.9863387978142075

7107717,2,B00VSG3MSC,"Giving it 2 stars, rather than 1, because parts of most episodes were entertaining. Overall, though, this season is a shadow of the previous ones, consisting basically of only the unpleasant bits: death, completely pointless cruelty, and actions motivated chiefly by stupidity and the basest of emotions. I don't know about other viewers, but I endure the cruelty of some characters' actions (as well as the scenes with overly explicit violence) because of the occasional well-crafted wins of the more likable characters. There are very few such payoffs in this season. Instead, the good and the innocent get slaughtered without any convincing reason at all - other than the mounting suspicion that the writers didn't know where to place these characters going forward and used shock and awe to cover up the fact that most of those deaths made no sense within the story line. (Spoiler alert: some examples to make my point: Would Stannis really not try to use leaches, before burning his daughter alive, especially since they'd worked so well before?? Could the sophisticated Dorne courtisan, mother of four young girls herself, really have the emotional and mental maturity of a two-year-old, unable to contain her hatred of a blameless girl? Would Jon, who saw his uncle die and get burned, really fall for the lie of a supposed ""sighting"", thus letting himself be lured into a trap -- and delivering what was probably the stupidest plot bit of all.) None of these actions were believable and as a result the story became random and boring by episode 9 at the latest. It definitely helps me face the months of waiting for season 6: I just don't care as much anymore.",1450051200,9,1668,4.897526501766785

Great season but I hope they don't jump the shark, like The Walking Dead just did. Glenn falls into a bunch of hungry zombies who start eating him and then he slides under a garbage bin and escapes unhurt???

If John Snow gets resurrected and becomes one of the dead army...they just jumped the shark. It's customary for them to burn John snow's body. I think they may do that since the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones are starting to have a problem killing off main characters.",1448582400,,519,4.580645161290323

7107830,5,B00VSG3MSC,"The fifth season is very taken up with the theme of ""winter is coming."" Jon Snow receives more air time than any other character. Numerous scenes are set in the North--either at the Wall or Winterfell--and are literally dark, cold, and gloomy. The overall atmosphere is pretty grim; creators push the violence level even higher than has been the case in past seasons. I didn't enjoy this season quite as much as the previous ones, but I found it to be pretty watchable. Season 5 involves a lot of transitioning: major characters spend a lot of time traveling around or positioning themselves for battle. As someone else commented, the season tends to pick up around episode 8, with the sense that next year will be pretty exciting. A couple of new locations are introduced--one successfully, the other not so much. I would have liked to have seen a lot more of the favorite characters, especially Jaime, Tyrian, and Brienne. Still, this series, even when a bit disappointing, is still way above most others.",1447459200,14,1007,4.826589595375722

Some of the best written dialogue -- much of it witty and laugh-out-loud funny -- ever to appear on any screen of whatever size. Shot with the verve and scale of a Hollywood Technicolor movie of old. A lot of swordplay, grizzly deaths, bloodshed and sex. But all of it excellently choreographed and photographed, with much of the action being unexpected and engrossing. G.O.T. is a fully realized alternate time, place and world. And it has lots of smart things to say about power, politics, ambition, the human heart and the human species capacity for both cruelty and nobility. Also, the supernatural creatures (White Walkers, e.g.) are vivid and realistic, and the dragons, onscreen neither too much nor too little, are freaking awesome!",1446336000,,885,5.23943661971831

I highly recommend the series, and I especially recommend this episode to all fans of ""The Game of Thrones"".",1446249600,,718,4.235294117647059
7107896,4,B00VSG3MSC,"It's not like GOT needs my review: it's addictive and the addicts (myself included) will watch it no matter what. That said, be prepared to overlook a number of continuity problems in both plot and character development. And, even though chunks of the book have been cut because of the differences between reading and watching a story, you still can't escape the feeling that more than a few episodes have excess ""padding."" Well, as I said before, none of that matters anyway because, like always, the last scene of each episode hooks you and you NEED, like any addict, to have more.",1446249600,5,583,4.7254901960784315
7107897,2,B00VSG3MSC,"I caught up on everything else and decided to give this show another chance. But I don't know why. It's a consistently depressing show with a darkly cynical look at people and life in general.

Oh, but the visuals are top notch. Great music & acting. Also, hey, obligatory nudity several times an episode to keep your attention. Who cares if the content is lacking?

It's quite formulaic at this point. Set up a character as someone hopeful who will maybe stop the vile people from continually succeeding. Then kill/cripple that character in a humiliating or depressing way. Show again and again how beneficial it is to be selfish, uncaring, and even sadistic, with repercussions coming infrequently if at all.

Also, here we are at the end of the 5th season and what has really changed? A lot of characters are dead to make way for new ones that fill most of the same roles. But the overall situation is the same. The worst people continue to fight over who gets to be the ineffectual high king (with lots of pointless backstabbing), while the looming threat of ice zombie warriors teased in the first 20 minutes of the first episode of the first season is still maybe going to invade someday. Keep waiting... any moment now.

This show could go on for another ten years at the pace it's going now--I see it grinding to a halt before any kind of resolution happens. I stepped away from this show for 2 years, I come back, and it's the same demoralizing messages in a pretty wrapper that made me leave in the first place.",1446249600,9,1521,4.56043956043956

Again, in season 5, Game of Thrones has brought out excitement, action, and drama at its best. Season five was full of surprise that I did not expect to happen in the show. This is a great show with a great cast. I find it amazing how shows such as Game of Thrones can take a beginning actor or actress, and turn them into instant stars.

7107959,5,B00VSG3MSC,"OK its not really perfect. But I rate it five stars because of the way this show draws the viewer in, holding you like a magnet or some inescapable force. Some of the characters are so wonderful, that ""a person"" wants to be them or know them, Jagen H'gar for instance. The lesser characters are vastly better than most of the main characters. Note to George Martin, ""stop killing off your best main characters.""Breanne Is a Great character Please don't kill her. She is the best female role/actor in the series.
When you lose a Great character like Ned Stark, the ones that fill the void may not be as interesting.
Plot line holds interest, even though you know you are being manipulated by lesser plots, that are inserted for ""filling"" out the length of the show.
Have to say, female roles are not as strong as male roles. Its not the story at fault, but perhaps the inexperience of female actors in main roles. Caitlin,Cersei and Denrys, good but not great. Stark daughters OK, not as good as their half brother, Jon.
Another good female character was Jon Snow's wildling lover, alas, killed off. The new queen,Liking the new queen, Margery, better then most. Great characters,Tyrion(of course), Peter Bayleis, Varys ,Stannis Baratheon, Davos Seaworth, Bronn, Jorah Marmont, Ramsey Snow, Theon Greyjoy, Samwell Tarley. Note that female characters not as strong as male, but believe actor is the reason, not writing.

By the way the author who wrote the book is in the middle of writing the next 3 books I believe and wasn't involved in this season story; though it follows some of the things written in the book.  From what I heard from a friend that read all the books which isn't finished (3 books to finish) the story is slightly close to the tv series but off in some ways.  Not sure if that's good or bad.  I guess not everything can be just like the book.  (lord of the rings would be 10 movies if they were to do it all hehe for example).,1445299200,,597,3.933333333333333

Sure the big battle is coming, winter is coming, something big is coming and you know what?  I never does and it has been 5 seasons. And they have a habit of killing off some of the best characters after spending so much time building up backstory etc. and increasingly the replacement characters are less interesting or have less depth.  I am done.  I keep waiting for the big payoff for the big build up to whatever and inevitably it never happens.  The dramatic buildup does not lead to a big payoff.

Continuing cleansing of characters leaves a broad possibility for course of actions for GoT Seasons oncoming.

What is clear, producers move from pornography to staging dramas reflects their possible request for cinematographic prizes in the future.

So far, accentuating on religious extremism and pleasing the plebs with populistic actions trigger a very grey area of humanity.

This season is essentially a complete different story from the books and some of it is cool, but some of it is not so cool. In my opinion, 2 of the best episodes in the entire show are from this season (episode 8 and 10), but the rest of the season has some not so good episodes. Some of the story lines in this season seemed forced and make no sense. I still love Game of Thrones, and this season is definitely still worth watching, especially for the last few episodes, but this season in my opinion is probably the worst one so far. But with that being said, the worst Game of Thrones season is still really good.

7108102,4,B00VSG3MSC,"This was a great episode and a great season.  My only gripe with the season is that I wished that they had stayed truer to the books on some of the plot points; namely some of the ones that made the end of A Dance with Dragons so much of a cliffhanger - Kevan's assassination, the letter from Ramsay Bolton, Davos' meeting with Lord Manderly about Rickon - none of these things happened in the show.  However, I will say that Cersei's pennance walk in particular was very well done, and I also liked Arya's part, and the battle in the fighting pits was great.  So I give four out of five stars because it is a great show with a five star presentation, but a star deducted for once again spending yet another season removing important plot points from the book series so they can give us more boobs.  And that ""bad p---y"" line was unforgivably bad.  I can only imagine the actress saying to the director - do I really have to say this?  Really.

How could they ever do that if you think about it. These 5 seasons would have had to be 20 seasons at least. There is just way too much material by George R.R.

7108118,3,B00VSG3MSC,"I did not like this season as much as the other four. It seemed like there were way too many battle scenes and not enough interesting dialogue. I realize this season pretty much departed from the books, but it almost seemed like they didn't know what to do with Daenerys Targaryn. Forgive me if I spelled it wrong. It was like they could not decide if they wanted her to succeed or fail at being the Queen. Peter Dinklage deserved his Emmy and was outstanding as always. He is a truly once in a generation actor. Cersei seemed wan and listless without her father and Jamie to play off of. The scenes at Winterfell with Ramsey Bolton (formerly Snow) were creepier than the White Walkers. Sam Tarley was still as likeable as always and seemed to mature this season in his love and responsibility for Gilly and the baby.",1443571200,4,817,4.489932885906041

What will Cersi do to those who persecuted her?  What will she do when she finds out her daughter may be dead?  That scene at the end of episode 10 where Cersi does the walk of shame is difficult to watch.  Despite all the horrible things she's done to others in previous seasons, you can't help but feel sorry for her.  You can't help but admire her dignity and poise as she walked thru the fire.  No doubt about it GOT is heating up and leading to an epic battle!!!!  If you haven't watched so far, start now before the season 6.

The writers of this series are so skilled at creating a cliff-hanger at the end of every episode that my dad and I stayed up til midnight binge-watching the entire season in one evening (and my dad is a 76 year old man who is almost always nodding off around 8:30 or 9PM)! There was the usual quota of killing, betrayal, and surprises, and all I can say about the last scene of the last episode without listing any spoilers here is that those writers darn well need to do something to make that right, and quick!!",1443225600,,636,4.444444444444445

I was waiting to fast forward or skip it but they showed nothing except her laying face down and wimpering. I've seen worse than this on regular TV. I believe in this story a husband basically owns his wife and can do almost anything with her. I personally don't agree with that, so don't beat me up for this, but it was not as bad as I expected it to be with all the press it got. So the season gets a 5.
I was actually surprised when episode 10 ended. I'm just not used to and don't care for 10 episode seasons.

The GRAPHIC burning of an innocent child at the stake crossed the line for me. This incident could have stayed true to the book and been included in the show in a much less graphic way...without diminishing the evil and conflict within Stannis.

7108220,4,B00VSG3MSC,"I have to disagree with a lot of people who thought this show was losing its touch in season 5. For me, this show has always been about the dialogue and we had some fantastic bits in every episode.

The writers had to make a choice and they took off on their own direction and essentially expanded on things that were just MENTIONED in the books, versus described in detail and from first person account.

That's the reality of dealing with the source material. Honestly, George RR Martin has had a major hand in the adaptation of this series and I can't imagine they completely went against him in making this season. Yes, they took liberties and made changes, but I'm sure he was aware of them and nothing was outright opposed to by him (or we definitely would have heard of it).

Sure, this season had some missteps and. for me, the finale was one of the weaker ones because of weak pacing -- which came from the need to tie up multiple storylines -- and the writer's desire to leave other storylines suspiciously open-ended for next season (i.e.: the stannous season), but I've never felt any tv show (including this one) has ever had a FLAWLESS season to begin with. I feel other shows have suffered far more of a creative slump than this one-- this just has the added conflict of originating from a book (one that has taken far too long to conclude and hasn't had enough material in recent books to bolster a meaty 10 episode season to begin with).

Next season will be the bigger test, since we will diverge completely from the books. I'm in for the ride. I don't think this show can do too much wrong, with the exception of how it concludes. I really have no idea where this is ultimately heading, but in about 20 more episodes we will all know.

As for season 5, I got what I came for in each of its 10 episodes: great dialogue, jaw-dropping moments, beautiful cinematography, and fantastic sets. I'm still down to watch the game.",1442620800,8,1939,4.466101694915254

7108236,1,B00VSG3MSC,"This season was extremely disappointing. A weak plot, poorly written and unconvincing, turns characters who were once compelling and visceral into boring actors whose appearances' only purpose seems to be wasting screen time. The haphazard disposal of characters - instead of being exciting plot twists - now appear to be motivated by convenience. The writers lack the ability to create a realistic plot twist, and their attempts to mimic one only succeed in disgusting the viewer. Rape and death can only carry a story so far, and it dropped my attention far short of the finish line. The whole experience seemed like it was meant to string me along until next season; to partially satiate my need for this previously-unique show in order to ensure that I come back for Season 6. I expected so much more because I was so pleased with the first four seasons, and feel let down because this fifth season was filler material.  I wish I hadn't spent money on this.

(SPOILERS BELOW)
Bran did not appear at all, leaving his character arc hanging - unresolved - for the entire season. It also seemed like the writers couldn't keep all of the plot lines straight, and, when their confusion caused them too much frustration, they simply killed off Stannis Baratheon and Mance Rayder. I couldn't watch what happened to Sansa Stark. Finally, killing Jon Snow was a blatant, feeble attempt to re-create the frenzy created by the red wedding - a whimpering end to a dog of a season.",1442448000,24,1471,4.78740157480315

7108267,5,B00VSG3MSC,"Winter is Coming...Season Five has Winter a lot closer now and several well loved main characters are irretrievably dead by the Season's ending episode.

Season Four ended with both, Tyrion Lanister & Arya Stark, leaving Westerous aboard ships bound for a port across the narrow sea.  Tyrion finally arrives in Valaria and is freed from his crate. He speaks about tolerating conditions lacking even the most basic comforts while aboard ship and immediately demands wine. Some days later he's kidnapped from a tavern/brothel by the Knight that Daenarius banished last Season for being secretly in the employ of the dead King Robert Barrathian & spying on her.
Jaime and Cerce are in mourning for their Father, Tyrell Lanister.  The second Son, now King, marries Marjorie, who was to be dead King Joffry's Queen.  The marriage is extremely happy and this why the Dowager Queen Mother, Cerce, encourages the popularity of a new narrow minded religion in Westerous.  She emotionally backhands Jaime in regards to their daughter, Myrcella, and Jaime leaves to retrieve Myrcella from Dorn and return her to her Mother.

Cerce also uses the new religion to be-rid herself of her fianc, Queen Marjorie's brother, a marriage she never wanted and arranged by her dead Father.  Her diabolical plans backfire as details of a sexual dalliance between her cousin, Lancel Lanister and herself, are uncovered and condemn her to prison.  She is escorted through the city streets to the Castle naked as her penance.

Revealed in this Season is information about a disease; the one that caused the daughter of King Stanis to become permanently facially disfigured in infancy. King Stanis who arrived to save Castle Black from the Wildling army in the last episode of Season Four; continues his advance and hurries to his next military objective-Winter-Fell. The Lord of Fire lady attempts to seduce John Snow while at Castle Black.

Little Finger, the greedy self-serving rat he has always been, persuades Stanza that she must participate in the reclaiming of her family home & honor by any means; including marriage to Ramsey (Snow) Bolton, a recently legitimized son of Lord Bolton, the new Lord of the North.  She escapes her new hellish predicament with Theon or Reek, as he is now known, at the end of this Season.

Meridian, the seat of Daenarius's kingdom, is over-run by a secret society; a re-organized faction of the Masters who were all supposedly killed when Dany freed the slaves.  She takes a lover, becomes engaged to a descendant of the old families of the city as a political tool and she accepts Tyrion as one of her advisors on a trial basis. Tyrion, Grey Worm and others are left in Meridian as Dany escapes imminent danger on the back of her largest dragon, Draygon.  A short time later she is forced to remember she is a widowed Calisea as she finds herself surrounded by a horde of mounted riders.

Arya, manages to find the man who gave her the special coin and gains entrance to the House of White & Black.  She swears fealty to the Order of the God of Many Faces and throws away all of her possessions in order to become 'nobody'.  She cannot however bear to throw away 'Needle' and hides the sword amongst some rocks.  Arya, a basically happy little person, sees nothing wrong with borrowing from the hall of faces in order to erase another name off of her long list and is subjected to an extreme punishment as a consequence.

Good Season I especially liked it when Cerce, (however you spell it), gets a taste of her own medicine.",1442275200,6,3539,4.81023102310231

Out of all the villains in the series that smug, you know what, really makes me mad.  Could not understand stabbing The Night Watchman Leader, Leader mind you, at the end.

7108309,2,B00VSG3MSC,"This season has lost any reasonable sense of humanity and compassion. It is one thing to portray this middle ages saga as brutal and real, it is quite another to destroy any sense of human connection between the viewer and several of the principle characters. The script  often economizes on character development and in the process fails to provide us with any reason to identify with the characters or their decent into a radically dark vision of the world that is so hopeless that it places them beyond redemption. The only characters who remain truly interesting are ; Tyrion, Daenerys,Lord Varys and perhaps Arya Stark (although Arya  is sinking fast into the muck and any remaining spark of humanity may soon be extinguished in her as well). We are all well aware that the producers of this series can titillate us with  violent, gratuitous, and salacious sex and stun our sensibilities with depictions of torture and monstrous cruelty. What is missing is any insight into why the characters, who are guilty of these acts, are compelled to do them. I don't need  freshman psychology, just a little character development and some self disclosure by those involved.",1441843200,5,1169,4.948979591836735

7108359,1,B00VSG3MSC,"Christ what a waste. It's taken HBO five years to get to where Martin left his fans six years ago promising to finish the ""next"" book within nine months. Yeah, yeah, there are actually books this whole thing is based on. Course if all you've ever seen is the series, you've been cheated out of innumerable subtleties and plot and character development. BUT NOT HALF AS MUCH AS THE ORIGINAL BOOKS FANS HAVE BEEN. Martin has delayed the finishing book/books for almost six years to maximize his deal with HBO. HE SOLD OUT HIS ORIGINAL FANS. And he's gonna keep on doing it til he's milked the last buck out of HBO. And he plays pious at the Hugo awards controversy. They ought to give him a special ""Most Mercenary Author"" award. Jesus wept. Rowling kept writing. Martin's all about the money. OBTW, the series just perfectly left all the main characters in exactly the positions Martin had them in pending his next book. So I'm sure it will probably published in serial form to satisfy HBO production costs when it comes out concurrent with season six. Martin is a sellout and needs to be called out. He's already made millions and millions, so hey...screw the original fans that got him here. Why not, Just spare us the Hugo Awards moral posing. You've become the Michael Moore of SF/Fantasy. You're always preaching, but you can't wait to cash that royalty check.",1441584000,6,1364,4.66390041493776

7108408,3,B00VSG3MSC,"As a fan of fantasy literature and, where done well, fantasy film, I thoroughly enjoyed the writing, acting, directing and skill of all involved with this series. But, in the end, this is not Faulkner or Tolstoy. This isn't Stalingrad or Nanking. It's fantasy genre that seeks to be more relevant. In doing so, at least for me, it has crossed a line where it is no longer enjoyable. Good fiction often pushes its audiences; makes them uncomfortable in order to enlighten or entertain. Great fantasy by definition can take us somewhere else. Tolkien's work was groundbreaking in that it took us outside ourselves into a world built upon its own mythology. Star Wars took the Western to space and added religion. In the end, I don't read or watch fantasy to learn about the cruelty of men. There is plenty of that to be found elsewhere. So, while the work and performances here are outstanding, I'm done with Game of Thrones.",1441411200,2,923,4.703703703703703

  This is the trouble with most all of today's group of fools in this business, they take off with magnificent material , and run out of gas before the end.
  I cannot even fathom a more lame ending for this series.
 I guess it's all about the demand for completion by all of those who make up the Ratings Clan.
 Screw up a good book with a stupid movie, ...........
 It is always about the almighty dollar.

This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days. With any luck, there will be many more seasons to come.",1441065600,,1413,4.494163424124514

And I must I was really surprised but not disappointed by the new changes, because they maintained the grandeur the show on an epic scale.

This show is more about thinking than feeling and is what made me engage with the show pretty quickly and I hope you GOT fans had too.

Fine, but it's been about a month that the last episode aired, why isn't Season 5 up for sale here at Amazon. I'd much rather pay for watching it on demand than paying cable. At the very least Amazon should let us fans know when it will be available on Instant Video. HBO you have thousands of fans waiting for the release; and Amazon; why post the teaser and not give us the heads up for the release date - you have a legion of fans that are not happy right now.

I'd heard the last episode wasn't that great but in fact it was quite powerful, even if you're not pleased by the course of events.. talk about trouble on the horizon.  Cersei's 'walk of shame', well, that was something to remember.  Gave me a whole new respect for Cersei  ;)  Episode 9 before that was something to behold as well.  There are now so many unanswered questions as to what happens next.  While the show ends on a moment that ought to leave you nothing less than raging mad, it's still the best show out there and has me for one, itching to see what comes next.  Check out HBO's 'Rome' if you haven't seen that yet and need something to feed on till season 6 comes out.",1435449600,,762,4.2727272727272725

7108594,3,B00VSG3MSC,"By far the bleakest, slowest season of Game of Thrones yet, but the night is darkest just before the dawn, right? But my god, this was a depressing season. No visible light at the end of this tunnel.

The first four seasons are just fantastic. Each one was a slow burner, but there was a suspenseful sense of impending doom that built up from episode to episode which finally climaxed in earth-shattering payoffs. Ned's death, the Battle of Blackwater, Red Wedding, Joffrey's shockingly early demise in S4 and Tyrion's trial. This one featured a fantastic eighth episode, one of the best and most eventful of the entire show, but it's surrounded by nothing but doom and gloom. There was nothing to really be afraid of or boo and hiss at (well, except Ramsay); it just kind of plodded along until stuff finally happened. And I hate, HATE what they did with Stannis. This has always been a take-no-prisoners show, but what happened to Shireen was just downright horrible and cruel.

But I'm not one of those people who's going to swear the show off. A lot of book readers were actually impressed D&D managed to spin what GRRM wrote in the last two books into bronze to make it watchable, and I'm still going to buy the Blu-ray. And no matter what I say, a lot of important stuff really did happen this season. I just hope season 6 is better.",1434412800,13,1339,4.551867219917012

7108596,1,B00VSG3MSC,"This season started with a whimper, and ended on the same note.  Episodes were sooo boring.  I rarely was able to watch one, without wishing I was elsewhere.  To add to the misery, they attempted to add shock value to some episodes, as if that would redeem it.  Honestly, it just made me want to watch less.  Never once, this season, did I look forward to the next episode.

I can only think of one scene that sticks out.  That was when Tyrion and Jorah were on the boat and saw the dragon flying overhead.  Only that one instance grabbed my attention and imagination.

Not really sure what happened to the creative talent behind the show, but thy tank runneth dry.  Oh, HBO, how I expected better.",1434412800,15,698,4.425196850393701

7108601,4,B00VSG3MSC,"Yes, I can agree that the start and finish of this season feels strange and even close to disappointing.  Sansa's situation, the underwhelming Dorne side of the story, the build up for Arya finally reaching the House of black and White, others parts involving from book to screen changes....and that season finale..It will rub the wrong way for many fans of the book series and the HBO series. Im not a devout fan of the book material, and Ive actually gone out and defended some changes like the Hounds fate. The season does finally pick up after the 7th episode and each one after pack an emotional punch that feel like you are constantly going up and down on a roller coaster.

After the supremely negative 6th, out of freaking nowhere, episode 7 and 8 remind you why Game of Thrones is still ONE OF THE BEST TV shows ever conceived. 7 finally pushes the narrative forward with key story elements from the novels Feast for Crows and Dance of Dragons. The 8th episode, titled ""Hard Home,"" pushes it even more and delivered One of the best episodes of the show's entirety. Usually its the 9th episode of each season that personifies the most shocking and remembered events from the books. I'm not saying HBO changed that method. The 9th had me grinning like a kid on Christmas. However,  ""Hard Home was the God(s)Send the audience needed for this show.  I pre-ordered a Blu-Ray copy of this season immediately after watching it on my small tablet through HBOGO. It was if the TV show runners said ""you know what, were gonna show this event anyway and remind the audience of what the real threat is."" Yes, this is part of the book to screen changes, but this 100% worked! The final 30 minutes of that ""Hard Home"" were as close as a Warcraft or Neverwinter Nights fan will ever get to see undead terror in live action format. With amazing CGI effects and stunt action, I'm so glad David Benioff and D.B. Weiss chose to have this epic scene happen. Then episode 10.... I'm not going into detail about it. I'm still trying to wrap my head on what I watched. Not to reveal too much, it's not a happy end, but more perplexing. Just watch it for yourself.

Once again, Blu-Ray is the only way to watch this amazing show. I still wished these seasons still included a DVD copy of the season so I can share with my family who still do not have aBlu-Ray player. I'm excited to watch the making of "" Hard Home"" and probably any other spectacular scenes of the season. If you looked hard enough, Mastodon fans, you can notice some familiar wildlings. Im always looking forward to my animated history of Westeros and Essos narrated by the shows characters as well. Also, and hopefully, there will be some  character reasoning or discussion from both George R R Martin and the show creators. I doubt they will go into super detail, BUT SOME FORM OF ANSWERS WOULD BE NICE!
Here's hoping the show can recover from the gut punches at the end of this season. Okay, GRRM or HBO, It's time to give us some closure.",1433116800,80,2995,4.5064456721915285
7108602,1,B00VSG3MSC,"I never thought I'd see the day that I would give a season of Game of Thrones 1 star but I believe it is deserved.  Like I stated in the title most of the best characters are dead.  For example, Oberyn Martell, Robb Stark, Joffrey Baratheon, Ned Stark, Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark and Ygritte to name a few.  So this season we get a heaping helping of Roose Bolton, Jon Snow (sorry but Kit Harrington has almost no charisma compared to the Jon Snow in the books), Stannis Baratheon and boring scenes in Dorne.  Man the Dorne scenes, while beautiful, went almost no where.  Dany Targaryen wasn't given much to do and neither was Tyrion.  They just kinda shuffled around.  Arya barely did anything either come to think of it.  The only characters I found amusing to watch were Petyr Baelish, Jorah Mormont, Theon Greyjoy and Sansa Stark.  Ramsay Bolton is an interesting character but wasn't given much to do either.

It would seem the show runners and possibly George RR Martin himself have run out of intriguing story ideas.  The war of the five kings was genuinely engaging but Stannis vs the Boltons...I couldn't have cared less.  This season had me reaching for my smart phone almost every episode.

The only arch I can think of that had a satisfying conclusion was Jorah Mormont's but I shan't go into spoiler territory here.  And the character that dies on the finale....really....REALLY?!!  Ughh...I can't wait for season 6...it can't come soon enough...

Oh and one more thing, SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS.  There is no Lady Stoneheart.  Don't wait for her...she ain't coming.  Why?  Undead Catelyn Stark seeking revenge.  There's barely anything going on this season so why wouldn't they finally include this highly intriguing character?  I can't even fathom...",1433030400,16,1784,4.837748344370861
