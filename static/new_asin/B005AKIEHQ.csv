8463342,5,B005AKIEHQ,"i love this dvd!! i discovered it when my daughter was 3 months old, and though i was going to awesome mom-baby yoga classes regularly, i needed more. my back was aching, my hamstrings were still so tight, and my core was, well, post-natal. beautiful, but post-natal. i started doing janet's dvd every morning, even before my classes. and although i rarely did -- or had available -- ""spare"" time, i could squeeze in the 20-minute workout in between feedings, pumping, and sleeping. i made it part of my morning ritual with my daughter...putting her on a blanket at the top of the mat and entertaining her with my hands & body movements. i incorporated her into it as well, holding her for the core exercises, or any other part that i could. she's 6-months now & we still do it every day. she's starting to crawl, but hangs around the yoga mat (i'm sure ""yoga"" will be one of her first words) and loves when i pick her up to join me. i'm so much stronger now and i am absolutely certain this dvd is why. it's been a wonderful ritual throughout this very, very sweet time. thank you janet!",1376524800,,1088,4.417910447761194
8463343,5,B005AKIEHQ,"I love this DVD!  I love that it includes a short but complete 20 minute sequence that I can squeeze in when time is short, as well as a longer 40 minute sequence that I can do when I have just little bit more time.  The sequences are accessible for beginners and for those of us recovering from birth.  They both have a graceful flow to great music and engage your whole body with some extra focus on re-gaining post-baby core strength.  I attended a few of Janet's live classes in San Francisco and she's an amazing instructor.  Her classes leave you feeling completely renewed both physically and spiritually.  However, they're very physically challenging unless you're a solid intermediate.  I don't think she teaches any beginner classes.  This DVD is a real treat because you get Janet's satisfying sequences and flow but at a level that's manageable for beginners. Sometimes I do the 40 minute sequence to candlelight after my baby is in bed and I sleep soooo well afterwards.",1340928000,4,983,4.741176470588235
8463344,3,B005AKIEHQ,"I might like this DVD a lot more if I hadn't purchased Janet's Ananda Vinyasa and Genisha Flow (two brilliant and innovative DVDs) first. This DVD is more standard, easier, and the commentary, which I expected to be totally interesting like her other two new discs, was kind of blah. (And I am a mother to 5!) If I wasn't in as good of shape as I am in, I might like this disc more. Definitely a beginner to advanced beginner DVD.",1329091200,,430,4.2560975609756095
8463345,5,B005AKIEHQ,"I'm a high intermediate yogi, and I've been practicing off and on for almost 20 years. This DVD is simply awesome. The production is stunning -- everything about it -- and the instruction is spot-on, creative, and calming. This is my first Janet Stone, and it won't be my last. I love that this is geared toward Moms (Janet includes nice, grounding bits of wisdom), but it isn't easy. I worked up a sweat, even with the 20 minute practice, and felt nicely worked out. A beginner could do this, but would need to modify some things. Seriously, this is one of the best yoga DVDs I've done in a bit. It's up there with some of my favorites by instructors like Eoin Finn (my all-time fav), Rodney Yee, and Shiva Rea.",1327363200,,712,4.401515151515151
8463346,5,B005AKIEHQ,I Love this DVD. Janet Stone is truly a radiant Mom.  SHe is also inspiring and helps me feel like a radiant mom.  This DVD is refreshing because I've found most DVD's that cater to Moms are super mild in intensity.  It's nice that a dvd for moms is actually challenging without zapping your energy level (no mom wants that).  Janets sequences are always very unique and smooth. I really have found my teacher and I go to her regularly in my living room.  Treat yourself to this one for sure.,1317600000,,492,4.362637362637362
8463347,4,B005AKIEHQ,"As a mom who is trying to incorporate yoga into my busy days more regularly, I found this DVD to be great all-around yoga practice.  Not for beginners, but adaptable to have more or less of a flow practice if you prefer.  What I have especially appreciated about it is that it is one of the only yoga DVDs I have found that really speaks to moms who are past recent childbirth about taking time for ourselves, and using the practice to be more physically balanced ourselves so we can continue to care for others.  It presents a challenging practice that is also calming and centering.  Very happy with my purchase!",1317168000,2,614,4.504504504504505
8463348,5,B005AKIEHQ,"As a yoga teacher and a devoted practitioner, I have been fortunate enough to practice with many amazing teachers from all around the world. Similarly, over the years I have watched literally every single yoga DVD I could get my hands on, always looking for the same three qualities I look for in a teacher: passion, innovation, and artistry. No one embodies these qualities quite like Janet Stone.

Janet Stone is a wonder; truly one of the most radiant and inspiring teachers I have ever known. Passion? She has it and then some. Her love for yoga, and the joy that sharing the practice bring her is self-evident. Innovation? Absolutely. Janet's sequences are some of the most innovative and exciting I have ever experienced. Artistry? No question. Just watching Janet flow from pose to pose is revelatory. Join her and you begin to create art yourself in collaboration with her golden voice and superb soundtrack.

This DVD exudes all of these qualities before you even press play, as the production quality of the packaging and disc pressing is first class in every respect. Everything you experience once the video is rolling is similarly phenomenal, from the menus to the soundtrack to the words of wisdom and meditation that permeate the practice. A bargain at any price. You deserve this practice, even if you are not a ""Radiant Mom"". As a man who can only worship instead of embody the divine femine, I still enjoyed every moment.",1316563200,4,1439,4.845528455284553
