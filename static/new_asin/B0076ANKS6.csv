5057452,5,B0076ANKS6,"The title of the DVD suits it perfectly with such classic movies as the Little Princess, Lassie, Alice in Wonderland just to name a few.  They are beautiful to watch wholesome, uplifting and maybe a little nostalgic.  They certainly will entertain all age levels and give many hours of enjoyment.  I am very satisfied and pleased that I purchased this DVD and would recommend it to all!  I would certainly buy more DVD's in this vein because they are just wholesomely enjoyable!",1373328000,,478,4.7926829268292686
5057453,5,B0076ANKS6,"We love the old movies, and this one has many good, clean G-rated movies. I would recommend this to anyone who likes old movies.",1364860800,11,128,4.375
5057454,4,B0076ANKS6,"I agree with the review by Vine Voice that the packaging and 2-sided discs are an inconvenience. However, I am delighted to get 12 movies, or even 6 ""watch-able"" movies like these for $5! You can't buy cheap and expect all the same packaging conveniences! So far I love the movies I've watched, they don't make family films like these any more, they aren't over dramatized, they are down-to-earth and the story lines keep to the basics...quite rare in any movie these days! I'm in my late 50's and I have relaxed and been delighted with the films I've watched so far. I'll update this review as I watch all the movies.

1. Mary White - I've never heard her name or the name of her well-known (at the time) family, this is a true story. Not ""sappy"" in the least. If you want the ""soapy"" bad happens that good can come of it you may not like this movie. These aren't Hallmark made movies designed to take you on an emotional roller coaster, that's why I like them so much! It's a good copy all the way around, shows just like Seabiscuit or any current quality DVD, good picture, color and sound.

2. Misty - I read the book ""Misty of Chincoteague"" when I was in grade school and, while I couldn't remember any particulars from that long ago I do remember I enjoyed the book very much. The movie is delightful, great for any age child and adults, too. The copy is quality picture, color and sound.

3. The Borrowers - I was looking forward to watching this movie, it's a great cast but a very bad copy. I would say it's been taken from an old VHS, the color is terrible, the sound worse. The camera work showed everything distorted, buildings sat at strange angles, distance was distorted, close or farther away. I couldn't watch it.

4. The New Adventures of Heidi - The only Heidi movie I ever saw is the one with Shirley Temple so I was looking forward to this movie also. It's a musical and Burl Ives plays Heidi's grandfather. This transfer appears to have been from a worse VHS copy than The Borrowers, it's terrible on both picture and color! The people are all bright red! Not watchable.

5. Seven Alone - This may be another VHS copy, the color is washed out as in color movies that haven't been restored. However, the soundtrack is an appropriate volume for the film, it's kept low key and although the music sounds somewhat muffled at times it's not distorted in any way and it flows with the story line. The picture may have washed out color but the voices/speaking is clear, the action and movement are clear unlike other film I've watched that are hazy and at times you can't even recognize the individual. Any person/detail is easily recognizable at all times. It's another true story, I believe it's well written and well done, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Since it involves the death of the children's parents, and the children have some hostile Indian encounters you may want to watch it before allowing young children to see it, it could frighten them.",1359676800,48,2964,4.5018587360594795
5057455,1,B0076ANKS6,"Any of these movies would be a delight. Time honored classics with super cast of actors.  Five stars all the way.

 But only one star because of three things.

1. Double sided disc - easy to scratch hard to handle with getting finger prints all over them.

2. The copy I received out of 2 movies I've watched so far 1 is unwatchable not because of picture quality be because of flaws on the disc itself. Disappointing.

3. Disc do not go into nice snap in plastic parts attached to the case , but into cheap paper sleeves. The disc can easily fall out of the sleeve or the paper sleeve fall onto the floor a get stepped on.

All in all when all is said and done. You get a great price on a bundle of movies but you have to take all the negatives into account before you buy.",1354060800,27,774,4.086092715231788

5057459,4,B0076ANKS6,These are from old movies so be prepared to not have the clarity (some are grainy and not a very sharp picture) as a new dvd but the movies were good and brings back many memories of when I was very young and watched some of them.

I loved these movies growing up, and it's nice to see the kids enjoy them so many years later. It gets those cell phones away from them. I hope that by using these movies now, I am saving the world from a generation of hearing impaired, visually impaired adults. Not to mention carpal tunnel syndrome.",1466208000,5,402,4.445945945945946
