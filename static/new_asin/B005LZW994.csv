4831308,1,B005LZW994,Not what I had expected. No good plot. Directors over use of the same local and house...got bored.,1447718400,,98,4.5
4831309,1,B005LZW994,Wicked Stepbrother was not only horrible it was painful to watch. It has no plot. The acting was ok. Let me save you some time from ordering this movie. The ENTIRE movie was spent with young men walking around a mansion with no shirt on looking for who knows what. Almost all of them eventually get killed (knifed to death). The action is VERY slow. You will be upset with yourself if you purchase this movie.,1381190400,3,409,4.394736842105263

4831311,3,B005LZW994,I'm telling my age with that title. The Munsters on botoc's. Their address was 1313.this is my first and last purchased of these thirteen 13's.,1335916800,4,143,4.76
4831312,1,B005LZW994,Couldn't even make it all the way throught. We watched it for a half an hour and in that time four guys walk into a house and are murdered. No blood. Terrible pacing. The score was ridiculously suspenceful when absolutely nothing was happening. It's almost as if Birdemic and The Room had a not even remotely entertaining baby which would be this steaming pile. Don't waste your time.,1331251200,8,384,4.661764705882353
4831313,5,B005LZW994,"Like most viewers, I found the Initial Batch of 1313 Films to be a mixed bag of Pros and Cons, Highs and Lows and Love and Hate. Luckily I am Happy to see that Director David DeCoteau has listened to the Criticisms and given us a Near-Perfect Thrill Ride of a Film! Gone is the Lackadaisical Pacing, this film moves. Gone is the repetitive usage of the same bit of film, no 2 minute shower scene taking up 10 minutes of screen time here. Gone is the crappy CGI.
 All good news for us Fans, but what if you are not one of us? Is this film going to change your mind? This is a DeCoteau film after all so it is all about Hot Guys in Underwear. However this one does have more going on Storywise and the Acting is Better than most.
 What really sets this film apart and Elevates it above the rest is the Welcome Return of Scream Queen Michelle Bauer! Michelle is One Class Act, reminding us Why she is a Star and no doubt Influenced the other Actors around her to step up Their game. This really gets me Excited for next months release of ""1313 Cougar Cult"", which not only Stars Michelle but also Original Scream Queens Brinke Stevens and Linnea Quigley!",1325635200,2,1151,4.251141552511416
4831314,3,B005LZW994,"1313: Wicked Stepbrother is the latest in a long line of David Decoteau films that has shirtless guys being dispatched in bloodless ways. It's really no better or worse than the others. I keep watching these movies though, hoping that one day Decoteau will get it right and make a new horror film / thriller that actually has male nudity, actually has gore, and actually it a lot of fun. Until then, though, movies like this are an okay diversion. Oh, and if you really want to get drunk off your butt, drink everytime a characters says ""Hello"" as he is walking through the house looking for someone. Good performance here from 80's B-movie queen Michelle Bauer. She's convincing as a conniving cougar. Worth watching for the cute shirtless guys. The twist ending is weird and makes no sense.",1320192000,6,792,4.705035971223022

8478882,4,B005LZW994,"The director, David Decoteau, is a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Roger Corman.  Corman managed to make a few good films with Ron Howard, Jack Nicholson and others.  Decoteau is clearly the worst director in the history of the medium.  I am a 62-year-old gay man, and even those young guys couldn't liven up this garbage for me.  After 10 minutes of the junk, I feel like grabbing a few back issues of Playboy magazine and cleansing my soul.  Shame on you, Decoteau.",1480896000,,467,4.716049382716049
