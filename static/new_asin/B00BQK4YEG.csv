The only problem is the choice of shipping they use. Fedex Smartpost is the worst. It arrived more than a week after est. delivery date because it went to 2 wrong post offices. Guess i was lucky to get it because they (fedex smartpost)have lost other items completely, never to be delivered.",1380499200,3,422,4.4935064935064934

8572677,5,B00BQK4YEG,"Season 3 was a very good year for Combat , You get a few stories in this set where they have  a  few episodes with a fine guest stars such as Robert Duvall as the crafty German bomb expert and its Handley's job to be them defused . Roddy McDowell as a German  officer trying to trick Sanders into bring the Squad into a ambush. Different filming areas one is a vineyard that's has  land that is majestic  for wide frame filming . Also the one called the Silver Service with Mickey Rooney as a crap cheater truck driver who  on leave from the Squad , Kirby gets stuck with Him on a mountain alp and another episode is  on a snow covered mountain top called the Mountain Man, about Sanders enlisting a guide thru a hairy alp pass an gets ambushed by Germans and they must ski to escape . I had trouble with disc 1 at first , but then it played fine . No CC , no trailers , no frills just a written blooper. Transfer is great ,sound is clear as well . In any TV show season 3 proves to be one of the strongest seasons due that most shows found it characters strength , as the Squad such as Cajie  , Kirby, Little John  ( Sanders . Handley ) all played well by the Actor that own the parts  * IF anyone buys these Combat Seasons make sure You buy the ones with pictures on the cover as this one . The older sets are cut in two an You will pay more make sure its says COMPLETE SEASON",1420416000,2,1378,3.978181818181818
