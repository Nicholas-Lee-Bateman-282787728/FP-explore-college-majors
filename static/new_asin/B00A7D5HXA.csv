8547777,5,B00A7D5HXA,"I love this DVD, in fact so much I start my day with it every morning without having to go to the YMCA.  Uplifting with Christian music and Scripture to encourage the soul as you build endurance and strength.  It is wonderful, after using the 30 minute one I ordered this 1 hour DVD and it is definitely worth the price and time.",1412726400,,329,4.2063492063492065

8547779,4,B00A7D5HXA,"I ordered this DVD in order to use at home when I could not attend my normal weekly yoga class.  I feel that the content is really good and the poses give the student a good workout.  The emphasis on the spiritual is also very good and encouraging.  I feel this is an intermediate program in difficulty or fitness level.  While I really like the program presentation of the poses, there are three items that, if addressed on future remakes, I believe could make it a great DVD presentation:

1) The background music is too loud and a lot of the music is vocal.  Thus, the vocal portion of the music conflicts at time with the  leader's instructions, making it sometimes hard to understand the instruction given. It would be nice to have the ability to turn off the music if one wanted to do so;

2) The leader wears a dark outfit in a dark setting and it is really hard to see what position she is holding, what position she is going into or what she is coming out of.  The abundance of  many candles also distracts from concentrating on the poses.  A different (or lighter) setting with the dark outfit, or a white outfit in the dark setting, would make it easier to follow along with each pose.  Granted, this could also simply be the DVD player and/or TV equipment that I use, but I found it hard to follow along;

3) A couple of other DVD fitness programs I own have a timer embedded into the program so the viewer can see how he or she is progressing with the program.  I simply like a timer for the presentation.

Unfortunately, I carelessly scraped the back of my DVD and now it has some bad spots on it.  I will be ordering a new DVD to replace it so that I do not miss a live or DVD session.",1398816000,9,1700,4.232919254658385
8547780,5,B00A7D5HXA,The perfect practice for any Christian who wants to try yoga without all the yoga babble.  You get to experience the physical practice of connecting to your body matched with the Christian's mind.  Courtney is fun and easy to take in.  Highly recommended!  Little Courtney is taking yoga to the Christians with gods love and will.,1379548800,5,330,4.839285714285714
8547781,5,B00A7D5HXA,"I commented on Courtney's 1/2 hour Faithful Flow DVD and its perfect length and intensity.  This hour long Christian Power DVD is perfect when I have more time to devote to my workout.  ""Power"" is the word.  You end up holding your poses longer and the intensity makes this a very rewarding practice.  When I'm struggling with a pose I lean on the Lord to get me through it.  Thanks again Courtney and Yahweh Yoga!  God Bless!",1373760000,5,426,4.467532467532467
8547782,5,B00A7D5HXA,"I practice yoga several times a week and often try different yoga DVD's.  Often I'm disappointed with the cues or postures. Several lack quality production, which can be quite distracting.  I found this DVD to be exceptional in these important factors.  Each time I have practiced with it I finish feeling well worked out and peaceful, both physically and spiritually.",1355356800,9,368,5.1
8547783,5,B00A7D5HXA,I've been using this DVD for two weeks now and absolutely love it!  It's a tougher class with a slower pace--holding poses longer to develop strength.  There are options for different levels difficulty and the instruction is clear and peaceful.  So excited to be able to practice with Courtney even though I moved away!,1354665600,8,319,4.87037037037037
