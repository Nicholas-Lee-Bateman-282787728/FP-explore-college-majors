It's a huge waste of money and time. I'm glad I rented it instead of buying.",1217030400,,150,4.172413793103448
2165382,5,B000641ZFE,"i think this movie is brilliant well made and funny.

i am a big fan of chris rea and he played the role very well.

i did see this movie at the cinema when it was released and enjoyed it.i have tried to get soundtrack of the movie but its not avaiable at this time don't know if it will be available in future.",1178928000,,311,3.84375
2165383,1,B000641ZFE,"What hold did Michael Winner have over Joanna Lumley, Bob Hoskins, Oliver Reed, John Cleese and Ben Kingsley that they agreed to appear in this horrible mess of a film? There is no humour, dark or otherwise here. Chris Rea can't act. He mumbles throughout and makes a very unattractive leading man. Why do aging actors sign up for ensemble productions based on a premise and script with absolutely no wit and no merit just because the director has a reputation? I couldn't believe I sat through this. In short: if you want a tasteless, depressing Brit flick, with a bizarre nod to 70s tack, complete with an overpowering soft porn sountrack, this is for you. However, if you want an intelligent, witty and truly darkly comic movie, rent anything by the highly underrated British filmaker, Mike Leigh.",1109980800,6,800,4.804347826086956
2165384,1,B000641ZFE,"Stay away from this one!  I bought it for the casting.  How could anything starring Diana Rigg, John Cleese, Felicity Kendal, and Oliver Reed be bad?  It is. Very.

The plot is predictable, and there isn't a smile, let alone a laugh in the whole of the film, billed as a ""black comedy.""  Indeed, the movie hasn't a single redeeming feature.  The music is irritating, and even the photography isn't very well done.  Oh yes, and Rigg was 25 years too old to play the part she was given.  See her in bed with a man easily old enough to be her son.  Mercifully, we were spared a nude scene.  In short: a stinker.",1108339200,11,608,4.254385964912281
2165385,5,B000641ZFE,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Chris Rea, and have nearly every song he recorded. I don't expect singers to be good actors (the opposite is often true ... can anybody say ""Madonna""?). I was pleasantly surprised at how good an actor Chris Rea is, and I loved the movie. It stands on its own as an original hilarious comedy. Anyone who likes the black comedy of John Cleese in movies like ""Fierce Creatures"" and ""A Fish Called Wanda"" should enjoy this treat. After years of buying PAL videotapes and German language only DVDs of this movie, I can finally watch it properly. Let's hope they bring out Chris Rea's other movies, ""Soft Top, Hard Shoulder"" and ""La Passione"" next!",1099699200,10,688,4.512
2165386,2,B000641ZFE,"I saw this on the day it was released in London and there were two people in the audience - me and someone else.

The highlight of this film is a bitchy Diana Rigg who is incredibly supposed to be married to the main character played by Chris Rea - yeah right.

I like the premise of the film too but I won't spoil it - and with such a great cast except for Chris Rea it should have been a blockbuster! But, it ain't!

But look out for Joanna Lumley (The New Avengers and Absolutely Fabulous), Oliver Reed et al.

I have the VHS but will buy the DVD too for my Diana Rigg collection.",1099526400,2,583,4.0
2165387,3,B000641ZFE,"Nothing about this movie really grabs you, but its decent enough. Its interesting to watch the lead actor (who is a musician and I don't believe had ever acted before), because he doesn't act like an ""actor"" (because he isn't). Some big names make very brief appearances (namely a hilarious John Cleese), but we could've used more of Ben Kingsley in a fun role. Some nice scenery to be sure as well.",1097452800,2,399,4.555555555555555

8038164,5,B000641ZFE,"Sometimes nice things happen by mistake;  without reading the reviews, I ordered this thinking it was a different film.  I'm not a fan of Michael Winner - quite the opposite;  but, after seeing the cast, luckily decided to give it a go.  What a delightful hoot!  The charm of this 1998 black comedy may be too subtle for some.  Yes, the plot is absurd;  yes, there are stereotypes and overacting; but, that's the beauty of it -- watching a stellar cast in a send-up.  (Rather like Sirs Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen in 'Viscious' or Sir Michael Caine and Christopher Reeves in Deathtrap.)  Thank goodness this film is not full of action, sex, graphic violence or belly-laughs;  it's just 90 minutes of rather sophisticated fun.",1427673600,,727,4.744

8038166,1,B000641ZFE,"I watched this with a friend because I couldn't believe it was as bad as he said given the impressive cast. Well, it's even worse than he said it was. Where do I start? How about the script? Which is dreadful. It's all flatfooted exposition and no jokes. At least not any jokes that are funny. The characters talk about the protagonist and his situation rather than the film showing it to you. What you see has so little character that you wonder how anyone could care enough about this guy to even bother pissing him off. To say the plot is idiotic is to give it too much credit. I don't have a problem with the idea of someone bumping off everyone who wronged him. I'm OK with nihilism and the violence isn't even graphic enough to be upsetting. What I'm not OK with is stupidity. A doctor telling someone he has 6 weeks to live based on one errant x ray is a plot too idiotic for a children's cartoon. So is a professional hit man deciding to take the blame for multiple murders he didn't commit ... why? It's not really explained. I wrote better fiction in high school. I've read better fan fiction. Everything else is just as inept. The upbeat music is supposed to be an ironic counterpart to the dark mayhem on screen, but it just comes off as painfully stupid. There are some interesting camera angles, indicating that the movie was made by someone who has seen a camera before, but there are moments of astonishing clumsiness, like the opening music cutting off in mid-note, and the way the numerous death scenes are shot, with arms fluttering, eyes bugging out. It's as if this were intended to be a parody, intended to be ""bad,"" but you know, horrifyingly so, that it isn't meant to be bad at all. Casting an actor with zero experience as your protagonist is a crapshoot at best and it sure did not pay off here. Anyone who thinks Chris Rea can act should be barred from ever having an opinion about any theatrical presentation for the rest of his life, much less being involved in creating one. Calling this performance wooden is an insult to wood. As for the supporting cast...wow, those poor people. I know Oliver Reed has been in a lot of Michael Winner's movies and I guess he felt obligated, but how did the rest of these actors get roped into this disaster? How do you manage to get a cliched, overwrought, cringeworthy performance out of BEN KINGSLEY? I wouldn't have imagined such a thing was even possible, but Winner managed it. I wouldn't have thought you could write a script so ridiculous that John Cleese is embarrassed to say the lines, but there it is, immortalized on film. Fortunately for Bob Hoskins, he just has to be nasty for a few minutes and then die, so he ends up looking a lot less foolish. Joanna Lumley as a shady bartender delivers every line in deadpan, which isn't interesting but at least doesn't make her look moronic. Reed as the hitman took the same approach. Peter Davison is basically the straight man as Rea's best friend and lawyer, and not being expected to be funny or evil probably explains how he coughed up the most credible performance of the lot. How he managed to react like a real human being might react when playing all his scenes opposite a two-by-four with vocal cords is almost impressive. It must be the three years he spent pretending to be scared by pathetic rubber monsters on Doctor Who. I felt truly sorry for Diana Rigg, who plays Rea's bitchy ex wife, and Felicity Kendal, who plays his current love interest. Both are way too old for their roles, and it came off as more than a little grotesque. Rigg's character had one speed -- oblivious bitch -- and Kendal had no character at all. So she sleepwalked through the movie with a dopey smile on her face, essentially showing no emotion at all, probably cursing her agent with every breath. I'm sorry, but this wasn't even bad in a funny way. It's just plain BAD. Wowee, super-strength bad. I'm checking my DVD player for corrosion now.",1373673600,3,3958,4.513927576601671
8038167,4,B000641ZFE,"By 1998 Michael Winner had had it with the movie business. His career as a restaurant critic was taking off and his colorful TV commercial career was just around the corner. The industry had changed and Winner's type of medium budget films were no longer being financed. So, for his swan song, he decided to make a movie for himself using a story that he wrote and peopled with several friends from the British film industry. The result was the appropriately titled PARTING SHOTS. In the director's written commentary which is one of the DVD's special features, Winner explains how he wanted to make a film that harked back to the Ealing comedies of Alec Guinness especially KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS. Combine the spirit of that film with the scenario of Winner's best known film DEATH WISH and this is the result.

Singer-songwriter Chris Rea (no relation to Stephen) plays Harry Sterndale, a less than successful photographer who discovers that he has only 6 weeks to live. When told by his lawyer (Peter Davison) to put his affairs in order, he acquires an illegal gun (remember this is England) and decides to bump off everyone who took advantage of him or made him feel miserable. These include his bitchy ex-wife (Diana Rigg), a crooked financier (Bob Hoskins), and a business associate (John Cleese) who stole his ideas. Along the way he meets the love of his life (Felicity Kendal) and in order to provide for her, he hires a hitman (Oliver Reed) to bump him off for the insurance money but then things do not go according to Harry's plans.

The film opened to less than stellar reviews (as did so many of Michael Winner's later offerings) and quickly disappeared. This Canadian DVD allows us to see the film again and to appreciate it for what it is instead of what it isn't. While lead actor Chris Rea is not to everyone's taste (I think he's fine), there are a host of delightful performances from the rest of the cast including Ben Kingsley as an egotistical chef and Joanna Lumley as a New Age bartender. The DVD comes with cast bios, background trivia, and the aforementioned written commentary from director Winner. Try it, I think you'll like it. Just don't expect Monty Python or Simon Pegg style English humor and for heaven's sake, don't expect the British version of DEATH WISH.",1362700800,2,2297,4.72568578553616
8038168,4,B000641ZFE,"The traditional saying is that nice guys finish last.

Harry Sterndale is a nice guy, and he's been getting stepped on, abused, exploited, lied to and scammed his entire life.  He was bullied in school, one of his friends stole an advertising idea from his and got rich off of it (and got Harry fired while he was at it), a con-man scammed Harry out of 50,000 and his wife (now his ex-wife) spent years verbally abusing Harry for trusting the con-man (even though she enthusiastically lobbied Harry to hand the money over and insisted that giving 50,000 to this guy was a ""no risk"" proposition)and then she divorced him for being ""a failure"".

Harry has spent his life accepting such abuse without raising his voice or taking any sort of retaliatory action against his tormentors.  In real life he would probably have continued to follow the same course of action (or inaction) until the day he died.  However because this is a movie, things play out rather differently.

When Harry is diagnosed with an inoperable form of cancer (and given six weeks to live) he decides to exact revenge on everybody who had ever done him wrong.  He goes down to a pub and purchases a 9 millimeter handgun from a barmaid named Fred and then methodically proceeds to murder those who had abused and victimized him earlier in life.

Since Harry has been given a mere six weeks to live, Harry doesn't put a lot of effort into hiding his guilt.  Murder trials can drag on for months, so Harry figures that if he's arrested, he'll be dead before a jury can ever reach a verdict.

I thought I knew how this movie would end (it SEEMED predictable at the outset); however the movie actually had a MUCH happier ending than I was expecting!  This time the nice guy did NOT finish last!  This time the nice guy came out on top!",1337472000,,1800,4.521604938271605
8038169,4,B000641ZFE,"Rea is not only a tremendous musician but shows he can act as well. If you appreciate British humor, this is a movie worth checking out.",1328918400,,136,4.269230769230769
8038170,5,B000641ZFE,"The singer Chris Rae marvelous as a photographer diagnosed with a terminal illness (six weeks to live) who on the advice of his close friend (Peter Davidson) decides to get even with ALL who have taken advantage of him throughout his life.
Brilliant performances from Diana Rigg, his ex wife, Bob Hoskins a scheming financial advisor, Sir Ben Kingsley, a mad chef/restraunter, Joanna Lumley a pub owner who supplies anything you want be it illegal.
Felicity Kendal who befriends him on his quest, Oliver Reed a magnificent performance as a high society ""Hitman"" and many other stars show up in this highly hillarious black comedy. It takes a short time to get going, but rest assurred you will never stop laughing, and will be it stiches right to the end of the film, which has a nunber of twists, and very funny conclusion. Listen to the one liner references to his photography by all the stars.

A Michael Winner production, I would say his very best.",1277337600,5,953,4.740963855421687
