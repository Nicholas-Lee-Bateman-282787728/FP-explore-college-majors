8091740,4,B000BS5SHQ,"After becoming very interested in adding percussion to our band, I began searching for some good instructional videos on percussion items. This one is very helpful. I'm a relative beginner to drumming, but not to music. And with well over 75 instructional & performance videos in my personal library, I know a good one when I see it. I found this one to be not only helpful from an informational & technique standpoint, it is also a good production. It covers many fundamentals well and is very easy to navigate. I believe it is most appropriate for beginner & intermediate students. The introduction to a variety of rhythms and bonus tracks make this video a more desirable one than most of the others out there about djembe playing.  There is much here for everyone & the price is VERY reasonable compared to others.

There are other videos in the Kalani jam series, and I like them, too. He is a good musician and good teacher. So glad I got it - truly worth every cent. And a welcome addition to my library.",1301788800,5,1011,4.549450549450549
8091741,1,B000BS5SHQ,"I was looking for a good DVD to help me along with learning a little about playing a djembe.  In particular I was hoping for some solid basic patterns.  This DVD fails on every level.  As a very first rhythm, you are introduced to five separate view screens, two of which are djembe.  The other 3 screens are an entirely different instrument.  Bottom line is this is not a good DVD for a beginner.  There's no fun . . . no spark . . . no simple instruction of 10 different rhythms to play along with to provide basic skills.  Check out YouTube first.  Then try to understand why this DVD has only my review?",1236297600,9,607,4.217391304347826
