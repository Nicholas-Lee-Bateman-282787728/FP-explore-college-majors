To see them so young is most appealing. Theresa Berganza gives us the gift of a program that accents her Spanish roots. She always presented de Falla on her programs and with reverence. Raina Kabaivanska enjoyed a immensely successful career without the recognition she most certainly deserved. This program displays her lyrico/spinto style with grace and beauty for which she was known. What can be said that has not already been in print about Carlo Bergonzi. Here he is in all his glory, singing the music for which he was famous...glorious. A joint concert by Mirella Freni and Cesare Siepi is part of musical history. They make beautiful music together and as soloists. Throughout these programs, the listener is treated to the familiar arias and orchestra interludes. They also can enjoy the not so familiar pieces which brings freshness to the ear.  Enjoy.",1432166400,,1024,4.91907514450867
