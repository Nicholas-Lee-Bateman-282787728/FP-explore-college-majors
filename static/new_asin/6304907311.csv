I was, and always will be,so impressed with Ekaterina Gordeeva and her strength through such a difficult time in her life.  She shows such grace and composure for herself and for those she loves; and her relationship with Sergei is beautifully remembered in this tribute video.  The one thing this video does beyond all else, is teach people to appreciate the people they have in their lives.  This video would make a beautiful gift for those about to be married, or celebrating an anniversary, because it shows that love lives on forever, and is the most important thing in life.

947352,5,6304907311,"One of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen.  I want to thank Katarina Gordeeva for opening her heart and sharing her love story with the world.  It is so rare these days to see a film that has a sad ending that is not depressing and dark.  Yet this story was filled with light and beauty.  I grew up watching figure skating and still think it is the most beautiful sport and art form in the world.  I did not watch Gordeeva and Grinkov, as I was a little too young at the time they were skating, but now I feel as if I have known and loved them all my life.  Thank you again to Katarina for being willing to let us into her heart.  The saddest part was when she said that she is disappointed with life now.  Unfortunately, I have been there, and I kept thinking that that the only way to have hope and joy is to realize that even though this life is fleeting, this is not all we have.  Our lives are eternal, and for those who have receieved Christ's love there is joy to come forevermore.  I pray that Katarina knows Him and His love which lasts forever.",1308614400,2,1063,4.091787439613527

I purchased this copy for my wife's birthday present and it sold for $90.00 on Amazon. It was listed by the seller as in perfect condition.  However, when she played the dvd it stop playing about 1 hour into the program and after several attempts at cleaning it continued to stop and would not advance.  My dvd player posted a notation on the screen that the dvd was defective.

Very disapponting for both of us.  Never buy from Amazon again.

947358,5,6304907311,I absolutly love the story of G&G this is a one time movie that anyone would love to have.  I have the VHS version which I love with all my heart.  Anyone not wanting to buy this movie is a fool.  You will fall in love with their story just like I did. ~Julianne,1170460800,2,262,3.814814814814815
947382,5,6304907311,"If you are a G&G fan and you haven't seen this, it is a must see.  If you have never heard of Gordeeva & Grinkov - watch it and you will fall in love with them.  Based on Katia Gordeeva's book about her life with her late husband (also a must-read) it features extensive footage of the couple and interviews with Katia and only a few hyper-cheesy ""flash back"" re-enactments.  It is more a docu-drama than a movie.  Now, almost 10 years after Sergei's death, with Katia remarried and expanding her family, it is still a beautiful movie to watch and enjoy.  And if you have never experienced G&G you are missing the greatest pair ever to take the ice.  This movie is a good way to ""get to know"" them.",1121126400,20,698,4.290076335877862
947383,5,6304907311,"Ten years. Ten years since skating lost one of its most beloved skaters, Sergei Grinkov.

This is such a lovely, beautiful, marvelously put-together documentary. It is a must see for all skating fans, and even non-skating fans can watch this movie and enjoy it, because everyone can identify with Katia's sadness when Sergei, her one true love and her husband passes away.

This movie made me cry. Katia and Sergei's story is just so touching.

Sergei, you are remembered and loved.",1113436800,6,482,4.925925925925926
947384,5,6304907311,"On 20 November 1995, figure skating lost one of its greatest athletes - ever - when Russian pairs skater Sergei Grinkov collapsed and died during a practice in Lake Placid, New York. Now, through re-enactments and footage of his career, Grinkov's memory is brought to life through this touching documentary, ""My Sergei"".
At age 15 Grinkov was paired with fellow Russian skater, 11-year old Ekaterina Gordeeva. Though the two were different ages and heights (he was about 2 heads taller than she), they became the greatest pairs team in the history of the sport. In 1986, their first year in senior competition, they won the World Championships. Two years later, at ages 16 and 21, they became Olympic gold medalists in Calgary. The world was introduced to, and fell in love with, Gordeeva and Grinkov - G&G.
Two years later the duo turned pro, got married, and won the hearts of fans the world over. Through Stars on Ice, they reached American audiences with their graceful and emotional routines, always consummately performed with style. When they returned to Olympic competition in 1994, there was no doubt that they would win gold again -- and they did. Within two years, however, Sergei was dead, and skating would never be the same.
Told through the eyes of Grinkov's partner and widow, Katia Gordeeva, this documentary is a joyous and touching film, as it reveals the life and loss of one of skating's greatest athletes.",1038614400,34,1427,4.900826446280992
947385,5,6304907311,"One of my favorite skating tapes!! This video is for any skating fan, or anyone who loves a real-life ""fairy-tale"" love story. My Sergei has many clips of the fabulous Katia & Sergei of their training and skating programs from early competitions to Olympic glory. This is a video with a timeless story of dedication and love.

947386,4,6304907311,"Very nice and loving tribute to Sergei Grinkov by wife Ekaterina Gordeeva. From the begining I was a fan of Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov the skating team.
Though very well done, this video is not what I expected. I  was expecting something more like a ""movie of the week."" Examples  of this would be, ""The Grace Kelly Story"" or ""Seleena.""  Movies done with actors. That said... Dispite my mild disappointment this  is a great video.
""My Sergei,"" is more like a docudrama told  through the eyes of Ekaterina Gordeeva. Ekaterina narrates the video as she  refects on her life with Sergei. Through Ekaterina's refections, we re-live  some Gordeeva and Grinkov Staking moments. We witness a budding romance,  the happiness, and the grieving from the loss of Sergei. As well as, the  move forward for Ekaterina and her daughter.
""My Sergei,"" is a  fairytale cut short. The ""Romeo and Juliet"" of the '90's. A must  have for any skating fan.",961718400,15,943,4.83125

I followed their skating, and remember the first time I saw them win the gold on tv in the Olympics!! They have always been my absolute favorites... I have cheered them on, routed for them, etc... it wasn't a matter of USA against USR for me... watch them!! You will see!! Even before they fell in love, it was perfection at its finest!! I read the book, and saw the release of the t.v documentary on its initial release date, and somehow felt like a part of my life had been upturned also... It truly was/is a travesty, having lost such a true talent such as Sergei!!",1437782400,,719,4.373134328358209

I've followed them during their high points and was just as devistated as they were when Sergei  suddenly died.  I loved to watch them do their routines and enjoyed every minute  of  it.

7880444,5,6304907311,"I have only begun looking at this but I already know it will be a treasure because it hadn't been on 3 minutes before tears came into my eyes.  And, I'm not a person that cries easily. They were the best pairs skaters that ever were and the world will never see anything like them again.  Yes, there had been excellent pairs skaters before and will be again but never again will we see love and beauty as well as perfection brought onto the ice like they brought it.  I'm old enough to remember when they were winning Olympic gold medals and figure skating was so popular that there were many specials on t.v.  So, I saw them many, many times and actually still have tapes of most of the Olympics they skated in.  Every now and then I look at them again just to watch perfection and to experience as much as I can the love that was between them. I also read the book.  I can see that this tape will be one of my treasures.  Thanks. LATER:  O.K. I finished watching it and still say it is a TREASURE.  I was surprised to see so many full length performances on this tape, some of them from the very start of their career and I'm thrilled to have these. Even nearly 20 years later, it still seems like just such a tragedy.",1392249600,2,1220,4.17948717948718
