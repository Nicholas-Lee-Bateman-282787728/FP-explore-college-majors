All I can say for sure is that the emotions I had during and around the time I saw this silly flick were very poignant, and are still with me, accessible at unexpected times.",1182297600,8,346,3.9571428571428573
364915,5,6301778359,It was 50 years ago when this movie came out starring the great Jerry Lewis. Fun story line about our hero as a policeman! This is true Jerry Lewis at his hilarious best.

364918,4,6301778359,"The ""Delicate Delinquent"" was originally written for Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, but it became Jerry's first solo film.  The movie is a departure from the slapstick comedy Lewis had done with Martin.  I would describe it as a drama with comedy.  Jerry plays a young man in a tough city who isn't exactly a ""delinquent"", but certainly has stopped attempting to live up to his potential.  Jerry's speech in the middle of the film is certainly devoid of humor:  ""When I was a kid I was jerky, now I'm a man, and I'm lonely...I'm a nowhere, a no place.""  However, a false arrest turns his life around as a police officer takes a special interest in ""reforming"" him.
Dean Martin turned the film down, before the partnership desolved, becuase he didn't want to play a cop, but Lewis turns this black and white story into a personal epic about standing on your own and making a difference (a fitting message for someone who had just launched into a solo career after coming off what was then the biggest act in American history).
Yet another Lewis classic that should be on DVD.",1078531200,29,1072,4.557291666666667
364978,5,6301778359,"In ""The Delicate Delinquent"" Jerry Lewis makes his solo (without Dean Martin) debut an excellent one. Lewis shows that he can mix comedy and drama with a big spoonful of feeling and message. His changes in facial expressions and voice add the extra spice to the film. Darren McGavin and Martha Hyer (as well as the street gang characters) do well in their roles also. This film is a Jerry Lewis gem that led the way to many more of his classics.",1485820800,2,445,4.439024390243903

365046,5,6301778359,Darren McGavin was good at his part of the cop. Jerry Lewis grew as an actor in this film. It's just too bad that Dean Martin turned the role down.

365197,5,6301778359,"Jerry proves in his first film outing after his infamous parting with his partner Dean Martin that his brand of comedy needs no specific straight man as the whole world is his straight man!  Jerry plays a peripheral (read barely in) member of a gang who get into a rumble at his backdoor and he is subsequently arrested along with them. Seeing that he's different from the others, a sympathetic cop (Darren McGavin) takes him under his wing to guide him away from the other gang members and make an upstanding citizen of him. Which of course is a monumental task considering who he has as a charge.
Speaking of which, you will get a 'charge' out of this movie.",1373068800,4,660,4.5

365202,5,6301778359,Jerry Lewis's first movie alone WOW this goes way back. The setting for that time period a classic. Some really funny stuff in this movie. Jerry Lewis goes from a labeled street gang member to a police officer.,1341360000,2,210,4.552631578947368
365203,4,6301778359,"After his highly-publicized split from partner Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis wasted no time getting out his first solo effort, ""The Delicate Delinquent"". And it kicks off appropriately with what would become a surefire Lewis shtick---two gangs of punks are about to rumble in an alleyway, via ""West Side Story"". Suddenly the tension is disrupted by Jerry bursting from a door into the middle of the rumble & stumbling into garbage cans. From there, Lewis plays a well-meaning schnook-like janitor mistaken for a juvenile but still sorely needing guidance & structure in his life. Enter Darren McGavin (deftly playing the cop ""mentor"" role which Martin previously turned down) who begins steering Lewis on the straight & narrow through some amusing Police Academy training. The script seems more like a serious drama gagged up, Jerry Lewis-style. It even calls on Lewis to deliver some serious acting, which he handles very well. This would set the tone for many future Lewis comedies as a schnook faced with problems both comic & serious.
Probably not Lewis' best comedy, but it certainly has its moments. And...surprise! A Lewis film that doesn't end with a broad gag but an earnest dramatic speech? Interesting!
Definitely a keeper for Lewis buffs!",1331596800,6,1245,5.137931034482759
365204,5,6301778359,"I thought this movie was instinctively funny. I knew Jerry Lewis was going to be funny, but I didn't expect him to meet me on deeperlevels of funny. I saw a sexiness in the storyline as well,where Jerry's character struggled with his manhood.  It gave me insight on what men deal with on a profound level.  For example, when he fought the Japanese guy, it was almost as if Jerry was saying that it is okay to not be so macho.",1294531200,3,425,4.234567901234568
365205,3,6301778359,"The Delicate Delinquent (1957) will  particularly interest the
youth segment, and a general audience enjoying comedy of a unique
style. It's  not unlike car drivers slowing down on a road or
highway,  hoping to get a better look at cars involved in an
accident for example, meaning there's an undeniable fascination
in the unusual.

Here, Jerry Lewis (who was 31 at the time) plays Sidney - a
handyman and superintendent of a large 12 floor apartment
building. Lewis's character is struggles in handling customer
satisfaction of the tenants, namely, in completing all sorts of
repairs, electrical, plumbing, etc.

The comical aspect, obviously, is not lost, in the juxtaposition
of the ultra-responsible, hard-working, model and upstanding
citizens in all walks of life with Lewis's character -  who is a
paradox of a human being, with a still-developing perception of
reality, and less-than apprentice-level skills in  completing the
oddjobs, in interacting socially. etc.

For example, there's an intentional awkwardness in interacting
with gangs, taking lightly  tenant complaints, ineffectiveness in
body-to-body combats, or in public relations with the public as a
police officer, etc.

Darren McGavin, as ""Mike"" plays a mixture of regular citizen,
(yet company man in the police corps), and model citizen eager to
lend a hand to a fellow human being struggling with various
challenges and adaptations. He's mystified of Lewis's clumsiness
- obviously contrived by the talented actor to reap the most
laughs and sympathy possible.

Next, Martha Hyer, using her own name, has a remarkable presence
as a clean-cut woman with a strong character and keen
intelligence, intent in being successful in her social worker
role and mission. In this particular case, she's charged  of
rescuing juvenile delinquents from a destiny of futile behavior
and misery -  that person being, of course, Lewis.

At the same time, the reason for Hyer's character is to perhaps
pull a few jabs and get some laughs from the too-good-to-be-true
image presented, as well as overdone spotless vanity, and
superficiality of some women, too often, in the 20th century, as
well as the ""social work"" or ""charity volunteerism"" used as a
litmus test in some classes, in evaluating one's worthiness, that
has to be demonstrably proven.

The work isn't dated too much, even in 2009, but is actually
amplified by the excess quantity and generic quality of too many
movies these days.

Society's hierarchical nature is acknowledged, which has been
mitigated since the end of military conscription and the
disappearance of rigid social customs in the mass media and
between various professions.

Jerry Lewis's acting clearly shows a natural affinity to film and
comedy, proving that self-deprecating humor is commercially
successful in entertainment.",1260230400,2,2816,5.349206349206349

This movie was written by Jerry Lewis for him and Dean Martin. Dean Martin was to play the role of a police officer in this movie but refused because he didn't want to wear a police uniform he offered Jerry to play a detective instead. The famous duo split before the film was made. So... with this said, this was Jerry Lewis's very first movie without has friend Dean Martin. Actor Darrin Mcgavin, played the roll Dean Martin was suppose to play and this was Jerry Lewis's ""first"" of many smash hits that rocketed him to become a successful artist in his own right and a mega star known as the King of Comedy.",1246147200,4,773,5.45
