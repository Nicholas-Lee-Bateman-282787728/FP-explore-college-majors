8174954,4,B000A0LAKE,"Puritan Pictures and CC Burr poverty row entry from 1936 directed by BB Ray.  Ray used a variety of names depending on what he was doing - directing, producing - and here he used Raymond K. Johnson.  Fans of poverty row films will know Ray and his nom de guerre Raymond K. Johnson from other films like ""Suicide Squad,"" ""Law of the  Wolf,"" ""Fangs of the Wild"" and countless others.

""I'll Name the Murderer"" is a dialogue driven thriller as newspaper gossip columnist Tommy Tilton (Ralph Forbes) works to clear his friend Ted Benson (played by Malcolm MacGregor) of murder.  A delightful mix of comedy, intrigue and music.  Look for the scene with the tap dancer.  I believe the dancer is the tap legend Ernest Brown (part of Cook and Brown).  If someone else can confirm or refute, it would be appreciated.  At any rate, the scene is short but the tap work is amazing.

The movie is light hearted and clips along with Forbe's bouyant Tommy Tilton.  We know he's going to get things right in the end and it's great fun going along for the ride.",1452902400,,1044,4.5

8174956,5,B000A0LAKE,This is another of the genre from the 30s about people wrongfully accused of crimes they did not commit. Unlike today when people were covicted of murder back then they did not get years and  years of appeals. Instead they were exectuted fairly quickly. So if you were wrongly accused you had to fight for your life. In this case the guy is lucky that he has a lot of friends who stand up for him and find the real killer - just in time to save his life. It's neat.,1154044800,2,465,4.1098901098901095
8174957,5,B000A0LAKE,"I first heard about I'll Name The Murderer when I was in film school but had not been able to track down a copy until I found this one.

Of course, I had to order it.

For those of you who did not go to film school this is the film that modern ""save the wrong accused"" thirllers are based on.

It doesn't follow the formula - it created it.

The basic deal is that there is a string of murders and the hero is wrongly accused and arrested for them. He rots in jail awaiting the electric chair while a long police inspector works to find the real killer.

He's saved from the chair at the last possible second - while the identity of the real killer is a total shocker.

A lot of films have been based on this theme including a Clint Eastwood one from about six years ago.",1146096000,3,771,4.0394736842105265
