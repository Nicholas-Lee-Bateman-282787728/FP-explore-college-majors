8289817,5,B001CUAZ66,a great WWII feat behind the scenes,1444176000,,35,4.142857142857143
8289818,3,B001CUAZ66,"I ordered this simply because my Dad worked on the Alcan highway, as a civilian worker, before I was born and I wanted to see for myself what was behind the stories I had heard.  I was disappointed that t the civilian workers were rarely mentioned...mainly the colored and military were acknowledged.  I realize that was a major factor, however the civilian workers gave as much service for their country, working long and hard hours, away from their families for months at a time.  I can say, it WAS informative as to what they all endured, however I felt civilians were short-changed a bit.  I also think the cost of the DVD was out of line......NOT worth the money charged.",1389571200,,676,4.608333333333333
8289819,5,B001CUAZ66,"This DVD covers the topic --the building of the Alcan Highway, extremely well.  The viewer learns about the reasons that brought about
its  construction, the engineers etc. responsible for its construction, and difficulties experienced.  It was most informative--both the
photos and documentary of this marvel.

8289820,5,B001CUAZ66,"This DVD is extremely well done that cronicles the contruction of this strategic roadway.  Once again, African-American soldiers were nearly written out of the history books in this story of extreme sacrifice by all soldiers in the U.S. Army.  I was unaware of this contribution by African-American G.I.s and the horrible treatment they endured during construction.

Thank You Again History Channel!!
