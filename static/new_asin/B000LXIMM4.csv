8165134,4,B000LXIMM4,"This product was informative and did cover many chokes and strangles. It is not geared toward beginners, you must have already had some type of trainning in chokes to get more out of it. The only thing that I disliked was that the transition from position to position was to fast. I also own volume 13 ""Nage Waza"" and it is set up slower and easier to lear from. Over all, I would still buy this again and I plan to purchase some of the other videos.",1200614400,,450,4.183908045977011
