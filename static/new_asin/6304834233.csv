7879582,2,6304834233,"This version is still a lame American version, Dubbing is still horrible as we can say ""rush job"". Alot of original music has been cut. Since I said the dubbing is horrible on this, the scenes aren't even worth watching. What ever you do do not buy unoriginal versions.",982368000,,269,4.510204081632653
