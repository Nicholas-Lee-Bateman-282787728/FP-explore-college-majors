8649749,4,B00JCE68X8,"This 57-minute documentary aired on PBS back in 2000 and has never been on home video until this new DVD release from First Run Features. As I watched it I noticed that some of the interviewees (John Updike, Roy Blount Jr.) were the same as in the other recent DVD from FRF  Top Hat & Tales: Harold Ross and the Making of The New Yorker. Then I realized that both films were directed by the same person  Adam Van Doren. The Ross film was made in 2001 so this film preceeds it by a year.

The Thurber film  like the Ross film is presented in the 1:1.33 full frame aspect ration so that you will have black bars on either side of the screen on a flat-screen TV. The colors seem a bit washed out so don't expect high-def.
I ve been familiar with Thurber my whole life but didn't know much about his person life. This film filled the gapsand even gave me the chance to hear Thurber speak  as Van Doren uses excerpts from a 1954 interview done by Alastair Cooke for TVs Omnibus.  There are comments from the above mentioned Blount and Updike (probably recorded at same time as the Ross documentary) as well as Edward Albee, Fran Liebowitz, two Thurber biographers and Thurbers daughter. The film is narrated by George Plimpton.

Thurber spent 30 years writing and doing cartoons for the New Yorker and, like the Ross film, Van Doren includes lots of cartoons (and their clever captions) in the film. Sections of Thurbers books and short stories are also read by actors.

You can find my review of the Ross DVD here on Amazon and the two films together make a nice pair and shed light on an error in publishing that lasted for decades.

There are no special features on the DVD except for a series of trailers for other FRF releases.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
