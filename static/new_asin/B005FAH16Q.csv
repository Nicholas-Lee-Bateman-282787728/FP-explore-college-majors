8469846,4,B005FAH16Q,"I'll leave the critical comments to those who are far better acquainted with opera than am I. I'm just a guy who watches and listens to these performances no differently than I do a motion picture with Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire or a musical comedy with Alfred Drake (whom I did see on stage). As entertainment on a Fall evening before the television, it beat out any competition put on by the broadcasters (although that is a guess based on my long experience prior to severing my sets relationship to the outside world.....which was accomplished a decade or more ago). To my ears the mild dose of modernism worked out fine.........and Domingo made for a first rate evening..........as did the accompanying cast. I suppose the story line was prosaic without great subtlety or profound depth. So what! I had many years at work to cope with intricate prose...if not music. I watch opera, musicals, ballet and detective dramas..as well.......for entertainment, pure and simple. (Oh yes, I have a collection of Mozart
and dozens of others who often reached levels of complexity for which Menotti did not strive.........but there is a time and place for everything and everything in its place............as the old saying goes.
So,,,,,,,,speaking now only to those who are seeming no more than a pleasant evening of operatic entertainment.....I commend this production to you as a safe bet for the average folk.",1506470400,,1407,4.991489361702127
8469847,5,B005FAH16Q,"First of all, do not believe those that disparage it, particularly the former (thank God) poison pen music critic of the NYT, who, at the time of its premiere in 1986 wrote that the music was mediocre  and Domingo a not very graceful actor.  This performance, from 2004, has Domingo in fine voice, supported by a forceful cast.  I loved the music: easy on the ears, and most of the time downright lovely. There seems a particular animus exists from American opera critics against American opera composers.  As usual, it took place in Europe, which has a much better ear for Americas music that America itself does. My only complaint: it should have been in Spanish!",1450656000,2,665,4.706896551724138
8469848,1,B005FAH16Q,"Even as disappointing as Domingo could be (small voice, uneven tuning and questionable vocal technique) this is truly the low point of anything you will have ever seen him in....  There is a reason the critics all trashed this when it debuted -- It is not just a pointless snore-fest musically and dramatically, it is the final indictment for the singing of Mr. Domingo.  Pavarotti had it right when asked for his opinion of Domingo.... ""he has no taste!"".  While we will feel the effect of Domingo's unleashing the barrage of mediocre and embarrassing tenors he championed over the years to follow in his aesthetic, you can still save yourself from this waste of time.... run... RUN!!",1445558400,,685,4.837606837606837
8469849,2,B005FAH16Q,"Goya was one of the greatest the painter, but the producers have incorporated to much of the religion in the trama.",1369094400,,115,4.523809523809524
8469850,3,B005FAH16Q,"This largely fictitious portrayal of the painter Francisco Goya was one of the last compositions by Gain Carlo Menotti.  It is a tuneful, enjoyable work, but certainly not a top rank opera.  This production is quite good, and Placido Domingo, as always, is terrific.

The opera focuses in on the love between Goya and the Duchess of Alba, a story that is almost entirely fiction.  He meets her when she is disguised as a normal woman, and he is enchanted, as she is by the drawings he shows her,.  She invites him to her mistress' place, where she reveals herself as the Duchess, while the servants laugh at Goya's foolish mistake.  Nevertheless, the two have an emotional/erotic scene of his painting her while they fall in love with each other (mostly him for her).

Act 2 takes place at the royal palace some time later, in which Goya is to be presented to the king and queen and perhaps become the royal painter.  BUT, before that, the Queen, played brilliantly by Iride Martinez, is a jealous, vindictive, and greedy monarch who wants to humiliate the Duchess of Alba.  Very well done and unexpectedly quite comic.  At the ball, when the Duchess appears, she is accompanied by her ladies, all of who wear the identical dress that the queen just got from Paris.  The Queen, of course, is outraged, and her retainer Godoy implores Goya to put the Duchess in her place (below the queen of course) at risk of her life.  Goya is quite unable to do so.

In the final act which takes place some years later, Alba is dying from poison (by the hand of the queen) and she dies, with the queen watching and gloating (""Get the jewels, don't forget the necklace"" to Godoy.) In the final scene, years after that, Goya is frail, deaf and largely blind.  He laments that he has not been more in favor of the people. Now he is dying, and Alba returns to say he is NOT guilty, she was, and she slowly walks out as he dies, lying on the floor.

It is an opera of scenes rather than a coherent story, but that is fine.  In that regard it reminds me of ""Nixon in China"" which is also more about impressions and not a true story (and isn't exactly historically accurate).

Menotti's music (and he takes a bow in the balcony during the final applause) is quite melodic- to me, more romantic/bel canto that Puccini-like as other have described him.  Very lyrical, even if I couldn't remember any of the tunes after it was over.

Special plaudits to Michelle Breedt as the Duchess, who was excellent.

This is a modest dvd. Good video, only stereo sound, but well filmed.  No dvd extras, but the booklet is fairly informative about the opera's composition. Well worth watching.",1367712000,2,2657,4.5399159663865545
8469851,3,B005FAH16Q,"It is always a pleasure to hear Domingo sing, so there is no surprise that in an Opera composed for him, he excels. But, the opera as a whole is nice, sometimes interesting, but not great. The characters in the plot barely go through any changes. Goya is the only one that has any development during the opera, and the changes are at the beginning of it and then it stops. The music for Goya is very melodic a la Puccini, while for the other characters is a mixed of melody with a touch of atonality. Performers are very good and make the maximum of the available music and plot.  The production is rather simple and for a small stage. The sound is stereo only.  For those opera lovers, this is an interesting opera and production worth having and watching mostly for curiosity and support of new operas, but it has no ""WOW"" effect.",1336435200,4,832,4.396103896103896
8469852,4,B005FAH16Q,"This attractive production of one of Menotti's last - and lesser known - operas is well worth checking out. Written expressly for Placido Domingo and premiered in Washington in 1986, Domingo carries the weight of the brilliant but troubled artist quite well. At its premiere, ""Goya"" actually did not do well in the press. It was beat up a bit for a weak and psychologically scattered libretto, also by the composer (so they say)  and for melodies that are quite typical Menotti (which is to say very Puccini-esque) but not very strongly memorable.  I did not see that production. My only exposure to this score is the present production, by the Viennese Theatre, under the direction of Kasper Holten and conductor Emmanuel Villaume and I found much to admire. Menotti's Francisco Goya is largely fictional. The painter is seen in a sort of lifelong quest of eternal beauty and begins almost as a Rodolfo from ""La Boheme"" but ends in madness and despair in what is nearly a ""mad scene."" The dying artist has not found the lasting love he thought he would find in his infatuation with the Duchess of Alba (portrayed here wonderfully by Michelle Breedt) in part to the Duchess own liberte but because a very jealous Queen Maria Luisa has her poisoned! It is true that much if these plot elements never happened. Various women of import in early 18th century royal Spain found Goya talented and attractive, including the Queen; so it goes. It is also true that Goya did die deaf, alone, possibly suffering from dementia (see his later paintings and their brutal hallucinogenic visions) and on the outs with the Spanish monarchy due to Goya's political disagreements. The rest makes for melodrama in the imaginative of Menotti but I find it entertaining.  Placido Domingo in 2004 is still a commanding figure and with a very strong voice and the subject is clearly one dear to him as a Spaniard (I think for an even more astonishing performance of the more recent - and older - Domingo, see his portrayal of Pablo Neruda in Daniel Catan's ""Il Postino"") However, soprano Iride Martinez nearly steals the show as the shrill, attention demanding, vindictive and darkly humorous Maria Luisa, Queen of Spain, wife of the somewhat mousy Charles IV (as portrayed here)  The staging here is a bit minimal but nice with bright colors (The Washington National premiere was quite lush according to reports). Menotti's score does contain several extended intermezzi in which there are - presumably - some scenery and costume changes. They are actually a little long by opera standards and the video makes up for what would be sound only by showing some scenes from the preceding action done very well and almost like an old scrapbook. The Vienna Radio Symphony under Emmanuel Villaume plays very well and the final scene, in which the dying Goya envisions his lost love, Lady Cayetana, Duchess of Alba, assuring him of her devotion - if not eternal commitment - is quite touching. There are several good reasons to get this DVD; for lovers of Menotti who want one the master's last big works, to have another fine performance by Placido Domingo in their library - made all the more wonderful - because of his own advancing age and, lastly, for some great secondary performances, particularly that of Iride Martinez.",1328486400,8,3298,4.852575488454707
8469853,4,B005FAH16Q,"Gian Carlo Menotti is perhaps best known for his wonderful and chilling opera ""The Consul"".  In 1977, Menotti invited Placido Domingo to dinner while the latter was performing in Edinburgh and Domingo asked Menotti if he would write an opera for him - and the agreed upon subject would be Francisco Goya, the Spanish painter.  Mr. Menotti chose the Countess of Alba as Goya's love interest (which is not factually accurate), but certainly in this particular production the pairing of Mr. Domingo with Michelle Breedt as the Countess works extremely well indeed.  Those two definitely have chemistry!  And needless to say, Ms. Breedt is a wonderful singer and is a real treat to hear together with Mr. Domingo.

The opera itself features Iride Martinez as the Queen of Spain, who also desires Goya and is antagonized by the Countess, whom she eventually poisons.  The painting scene between Goya and the Countess is playful and the Countess' death scene is particularly powerful and moving.  The last Act of this three act opera, where the Countess dies and where a much older Goya himself dies, is a fascinating combination of warmth and compelling sadness, mixed with forgiveness.  The performers are wonderful, and the sets and music (performed by the Radio-Symphonieorchester Wien and Festival-Choir KlangBogen Wien) all work very well with this belcanto-style opera.

I was captivated by ""The Consul"" the first time I saw it, and was very pleased to discover this opera from Mr. Menotti...and it did not disappoint in the slightest.  I sincerely recommend it.",1327190400,8,1563,5.094117647058823
