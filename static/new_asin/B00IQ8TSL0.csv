8644615,4,B00IQ8TSL0,"*Haunted High (aka Ghostquake)  an original SyFy channel movie  is a fun Lovecraftian-inspired dark comedy. And the fact that it featured one of my favorite actors  Danny Trejo  was an additional plus. He plays what is seen to be a humble janitor who is really the schools secret guardian who aids the trapped students almost futile attempts at survival.

Posh New England private school Holloman Academy was founded by the Danforth cult (direct link to a Lovecraftian character), there was a legacy of pain, torture, and even human sacrifice. When police raided the school in the 1950s, the founders were rumored to have committed suicide, though their bodies were never found.

Segue to modern times. History teacher Quentin [Jonathan Baron] has an obsession with the schools occult connections. One of the students, Dean [Gabe Begneaud], is actually Danforths grandson, and unbeknownst to him holds the key to stopping the upcoming mayhem. Dean has a pouch of gold coins emblazoned with arcane symbols he inherited from his grandfather. Quentin tries to pilfer one of the coins, and it sets off an earthquake that unleashes the spirits of the original Danforth cultthe spirits go on to possess the bodies of the schools principal and four of the teachers. It also traps a handful of students inside the building with no chance to escape.

Although many of the FX were extremely gory, it was amusing to see dissected frogs coming back to life to seek revenge on their desecrators. The reanimated murderous knights armor was also hilarious.

I did like the fact that the spellbook Danny Trejos character was reading from featured real Theban Runes (aka the Witches Alphabet).

Despite the laughs amid the gore, there were enough chills to make you grab an extra sweater just to watch this all the way through. Popcorn and other snackage is not recommended because of the bloodlust FX.",1423958400,,1885,4.996805111821086
8644616,1,B00IQ8TSL0,"This was awful. Rented something in a hurry from the Redbox and man I wish I had chosen something else. It's really hokey, the acting is bad even for Syfy. They advertise Charisma Carpenter but she's only in the movie for about 3 seconds. Oh, well at least she still looked good even at 40 something. Don't buy this. Don't rent it.",1402876800,3,331,4.354838709677419

8644618,2,B00IQ8TSL0,"This is a not very well developed SyFy film with Danny Trejo as a good guy. A coin dropped in the boiler room of a high school opens a portal to another dimension bringing forth the mass murdering grandfather of one of the students.

The killer and his demoness sidekick are not well developed either. He recites corny lines as a Freddie imitator, although not nearly as cool. This is a PG-13 slasher film for the kids. Adults will be bored.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex or nudity. Use of ""b"" word. Girls in school uniforms, but D.E.B.S. is better for that.",1397692800,,561,4.490196078431373
