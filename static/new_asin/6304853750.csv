7879951,4,6304853750,"Super Brawl is the Hawaiian Extreme Fighting event and this event is one of the best. This one happened on January 17, 1997. Their are only two tournaments in this event and two superfights. The first tournament is for the middleweights with former UFC welterweight champion Pat Miletich in some of his earlier fights and some rookie fighters in Ray Copper, Jason Nicholson and Taro Obata. Ok tournament with the results very surprising. The second tournament is for the heavyweights with Lion's Dean fighter Pete Williams in some of his earlier fights before his match with Mark Coleman at UFC 17, Japan Vale Tudo 1996 veteran Doug Murphy, Pancrase veteran John Renfroe and rookie fighter Duke Pa'aaina. This tournament was not very good, but it was decent. The first superfight is between Super Brawl 1 and 2 Lightweight tournament champion Jay R. Palmer and Kickboxer Danny Bennett and this fight has one of the best knockouts in the history of Mixed Martial Arts. The second superfight is between a pre-UFC Frank Shamrock and John Lober. This is Frank Shamrock's first real Mixed Martial Arts fight after leaving the Pancrase organzation and he was not use to the rules of the event while Lober is coming off a draw with EFC Middleweight Champion Igor Zinoviev at Extreme Fighting Championship 3. This fight will shock and surprise you. The rematch is on the UFC Ultimate Brazil and you may want to compare the two fights. Overall good tape and what the tournaments lack the superfights add.",995500800,,1495,4.889763779527559
7879952,4,6304853750,"A great MMA tape, featuring two superfights and two tournaments.  The tournaments aren't all that exciting, with an incredibly boring fight in the middleweight tournament where Pat 'the King of Boring' Miletich wins a unanimous decision against an opponent he should have put away in well under 5 minutes.  On the other hand, the two superfights more than make up for it.  The first is between Danny 'Boy' Bennett and Jay R. Palmer, who had a 4-0 record in MMA before this fight.  This knockout was so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes every time I think about it.  It's a wonder that Palmer's head didn't get torn off and go sailing into the audience.  The second superfight is just as good: a 30 minute slugfest between John Lober and Frank Shamrock.  At about the 10 minute mark, Frank knocks out Lober's front teeth.  During a standup, the camera focuses on the teeth lying on the floor of the ring.  Lober fights for 20 minutes with blood running out of his mouth from where his teeth should be, and still deservingly wins the decision.  I have to say, John Lober is Dead 'Ard.  You know you want to watch a match where that can happen.  This is probably the most brutal, action-packed decision I've ever seen.",970012800,,1223,4.559633027522936
