6302324,5,B00IXGU2TM,"great show, different from Breaking Bad but similar tone and Saul is just as great as ever.  I was worried with the focus entirely on him but I am excited for episode 2 to come out tomorrow!",1423440000,2,190,4.135135135135135
6302325,5,B00IXGU2TM,"If the pilot episode is any indicator, Better Call Saul has the potential of becoming AMC's next hit series, esp. among Breaking Bad fans. I really enjoy Vince Gilligan's unique creative style. IMO, Breaking Bad was one of the best written & produced TV series to date. Therefore, my expectations were fairly high and I wasn't left disappointed. Looking forward to the second episode. Great mixture of humor, suspense/surprise.

Updated after episode 2 ""Mijo"" If you enjoyed ""Breaking Bad,"" I highly recommend watching this series. Vince Gilligan's unique style and vision very well may have created another series equal to the brilliance of Breaking Bad. IMO, being a BB fan only heightens the entertainment value. The prequel doesn't limit itself solely to ""Saul's"" character. It seemingly is introducing an array of characters who played pivotal parts in Breaking Bad. Knowing the characters beforehand made several scenes downright hilarious.

There's so many layers to this show. BB fans will instantly know a few characters, as Mike, Tuco & his special relationship with his grandmother. There's numerous questions, esp. surrounding Jimmy's personal life that adds an odd, edgy mysterious tone. Enjoyed every second.",1423440000,116,1222,5.392670157068062
6302326,5,B00IXGU2TM,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode and am eagerly awaiting the second.
The opening scene pulled me right in, much like the opening scene of Breaking Bad.
Saul was one of my favorite characters, and I cannot wait to see what happens next!",1423440000,12,241,4.627906976744186

So, jumping the gun here with a ""pre-review"" for a ""prequel.""  ;  )

(Please, no complaints that I haven't seen it yet---again, going with what NPR said, but also just being humorous here).",1423008000,5,344,4.879310344827586

6302331,5,B00IXGU2TM,"been hoping for this to come along ever since the ending of Breaking Bad.
have been watching all of the trailers/teasers at AMC ...
looks to be great.
guess if i had a cable subscription, or a european Netflix account ...
i could stream it from AMC or Netflix.
US Netflix might eventually carry it but looks like not until after the first season finale.
guess i'll have to go ahead and do it here at Amazon to get my fix.
one way or another ... i'm in.

UPDATE Monday Feb 9th
didn't expect to see the first episode until after it aired at it's regular time Mondays.
but here it is this fine monday morning. excellent!

loved the b&w Cinnabon opening ... post BB Saul ...
and then the introduction to Jimmy's world. funny first courtroom scene.
and now i see a couple of familiar faces. ;)
yeah ... looks like there are going to be some great tie-ins to Breaking Bad.",1422921600,8,866,4.306748466257669

6302393,1,B00IXGU2TM,"...at least after the first season. The first four episodes were what I was expectng -- Saul and his mouth and his borderline ethically challenged personality getting into and out of interesting sitautions with interesting characters.

Unfortunately, after those first episodes, the show rapidly became little more than a soap opera that ACTUALLY focuses more on Saul's mentally ill brother and the conflicts between him and Saul.  That gets OLD really rapidly.  In the last episode of last season it's IMPLIED that big brother committed suicide. However, I'm willing to bet NO such luck since the producers seem OBSESSED with his character.

They did resurrect some of the old INTERESTING characters from ""Breaking Bad,"" but -- oddly enough -- those characters are given basically separate story lines of their own and have little interaction with Saul.

Finally, they toss in ""filler"" scenes that simply wear a viewer out. For example, there's one scene where Saul's girlfriend gets her car stuck in some dirt after meeting with a client. The viewer is then treated five minutes of watching her getting the car UNSTUCK!  Did the producers actually believe anyone would find THAT interesting?

Overall, they've managed to RUIN what SHOULD have been one of the BEST characters EVER to appear on TV.",1499644800,,1298,5.123222748815166
6302394,5,B00IXGU2TM,"I love the production style, similar to Breaking Bad, that can jump so quickly between highly dramatic and downright ridiculous without skipping a beat or committing a worse sin, forcing the viewer to ponder the plausibility of a story arch or scene. That's no small feat considering how many episodes do explore the absurd. And yet, it all works in the context of the characters and the show.",1499558400,,393,4.794117647058823

6302406,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Better Call Saul is a television series spin off from Breaking Bad. Both series were created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould.  In this first season, there are 10 episodes, one better than the next.

Better Call Saul is a prequel. What we have is a lawyer named McGill who lturns into Saul Goodman. We know the end, we saw it on Breaking Bad. In the beginning he turns into the drinking manager of a Cinnabon. We follow him on his journey. He is a loser and a confident man with no ethics.  James McGill is a man with a fate, heading inexorably toward a Cinnabon.

What we learn in these episodes is how Jimmy McGill turns to his haunts and his old tricks. What we wonder, is he Jimmy McGill or is he Goodman? And we don't know yet, but we will, how does he come to exist?  Bob Odenkirk is marvelous, so much better than we ever thought. And, the supporting cast is as good as he is. The writing is superb, small references to BB exist and are shown.

If you did, you will enjoy the Easter eggs and seeing characters from that series. I am a little disappointed in this DVD set, however. It includes all episodes, but it seems put together quickly without much thought. The episode names and descriptions are written on the liner and difficult to read through the molded plastic holding the DVD. In fact, you'll have to pop the 3rd DVD out to see them. It also doesn't list which DVD the extras are on. You'll just have to find them. One good thing I noticed is that the original volume has been turned down during the commentary so you can actually hear what is being said about the episode.",1494374400,,805,4.409395973154362
6302423,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Somehow, I stumbled upon this outstanding tv series which is truly brilliant, and so incredibly funny. Especially for those of us who have tried and failed miserably at either becoming lawyers (I didn't get very far), or practicing law(not even close). Though, I certainly loved ""The Good Wife,"" this takes lawyering to a whole different level. And Mike!- who doesn't love a guy like Mike? This cast is outstanding! Writer Thomas Schnauz is something else. Unique and true to life characters getting into wayward jams with no way out, but digging farther in. Charles McGill is also memorable and his affliction doesn't seem all that far fetched.

Jimmie McGill is the person inside of so many people that just doesn't quite make it out into broad daylight. He is the one we all want to be, only way more successful. I just love him!!!

This is by far one of the BEST shows that I have ever seen. Miles away in sarcasm and wit and just good old-fashioned fun. Thanks to Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould for making such a smart show. And a HUGE thanks to this stellar cast. Bob Odenkirk you ARE...the Man!!! Please keep this show going for as long as possible.

6302445,5,B00IXGU2TM,"I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this spin-off, in some ways finding it even superior to Breaking Bad in terms of character development. It's not perfect, and there are some contrived situations but regardless the writing and acting is exceptional. They've captured the setting and feel of Breaking Bad universe, including plenty of New Mexico desert, but put the legal spin on the series. It's a smart show and really fascinating to follow as the narrative doesn't seem as tight as Breaking Bad. Instead these are just the early years of Saul Goodman. You know what he'll eventually become and this is just the slow journey to get there. What really impressed me was the sub-plot involving the ex-cop Mike character. Amazingly well-told and in some ways I would consider the episode ""Five-O"" to be the best of this season.
There is still some of the graphic content and language similar to Breaking Bad but not as bad. This series so far seems more based on characters, dialog and legal narrative, all of which are exceptionally well done in this season.",1485993600,,1065,4.793478260869565

6302473,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Love this show! This is not a sequel to ""Breaking Bad"". Instead, the director takes the character Saul in ""BB"" and uses the same ""flash back"" style of story telling. It takes a further look into the character Saul. This show could stand on it's own but it helps to watch ""Breaking Bad"". ""Better Call Saul"" takes you through events that lead up to how he becomes who he is in ""Breaking Bad"". This show also has other characters from ""Breaking Bad"" and how he becomes involved with them.",1483056000,,485,4.46067415730337

6302477,5,B00IXGU2TM,"An amazing first season for the Breaking Bad spin-off companion series.  Better Call Saul season 1 starts off with a fast forward scene beyond Breaking Bad, and then quickly takes us back to the time before Breaking Bad when Saul Goodman was 'Slippin' Jimmy- a sleazy street scammer with no ambition or desire to do anything with his life until.... well, that's for you, the viewer, to discover!

The same level of quality from Breaking Bad is here, but the show borders more on humor than crime drama that BB is known for; however, that's not to say that Better Call Saul is a comedy- it is not.  It has its fair share of quirky, dark humor, but just like Breaking Bad, is sprinkled with action, drama, and some in your face violence at times.",1482710400,,744,4.496296296296296

6302489,5,B00IXGU2TM,"I've read several reviews which compare Better Call Saul to Breaking Bad, and they all point out how Saul differs from Breaking Bad, which is unavoidable considering the powerful nature of Breaking Bad, and the splendid contribution Saul made to that series as a supporting character (for me he stole the show, and even before the spinoff, I thought a spinoff centering around Saul was unavoidable).  As the other reviews point out, the two shows are very different.  Saul is slower paced.  I'm a year and a half into the series today, and still waiting for Saul's transformation, which as yet is only hinted at.  Saul is slower paced perhaps, but every bit as interesting as the mother program.  His entanglements with other characters, many who we've already met in Breaking bad are compelling.

The only character who jars my sense of realism is Saul's brother who has this wonky physical (or is it mental?) disorder.  I'm hoping to find out because I really can't tell.  Everyone in the script treats his disorder as real, but Saul's brother, a brilliant attorney, seems kind of nuts to me.  The actor does a good job, but the character doesn't seem plausible.  His character is too over the top to be convincing.

Having said that, this show is as equally powerful as Breaking Bad, but in a quiet sort of way.  Identifying it as interesting is probably the most accurate description, but on the other hand, saying it is ""interesting"" understates how drawn into the series I am.  Try as I might to savor the series and limit my viewing to one show every other day, I end up binge watching, and will be done with it well before the week is up.",1481500800,4,1646,4.63448275862069

6302516,4,B00IXGU2TM,"For the die hard fans of Breaking Bad, the series ending was a crushing blow, and as is the case with the more popular series, few were happy with the way it ended. The fans wouldn't be disappointed for long however, as it was soon announced that fan favorite, Bob Odenkirk, who played shady lawyer Saul Goodman, would be getting his own spin-off and once again Vince Gilligan and the beloved genre he created lived on.

Better Call Saul is not what most of us expected it to be, as we assumed, Saul wouldn't stay where he was after the events of the Breaking Bad finale, and that we'd come to see what's next, but in fact, it's just the opposite. The series begins with a depressed and sentimental Saul, taking a look back at where it all started, back when he was kind of an honest man, who kind of cared about a few people, and went by his real name, James McGill. McGill was a con-artist who was frequently bailed out by his brother (Michael McKean) who was a big time lawyer at a huge firm. It was he who convinced Jimmy to turn his life around and try to follow in his footsteps and that's what he did....kind of.

Lets start with the show, because it is every bit as clever and well written as Breaking Bad was. You might not have the shocking violence, at least not yet, but as with it's predecessor, the show is always three steps ahead of you, it's clever, humorous in that dry kind of way, and it is extremely entertaining.

Also similar to Breaking Bad, you have some great side characters, but one man is the show, and that man is Bob Odenkirk. If you thought he was good on Breaking Bad, you haven't seen anything yet. By the time he was Saul, he was a complete con-man, everything was a joke or a scam, but Jimmy, he hasn't really crossed that line completely, he has his moments, but he still has his humanity and compassion. That internal struggle between doing what's right and doing what he deems is necessary is at the heart of the show, and Bob Odenkirk is the heart and soul of the show.

The bottom line, Better Call Saul is not on the same level as Breaking Bad...YET, but it's headed that way. What did you think of Breaking Bad after twenty episodes? Did you feel the same way as you did after sixty? That's the point, Saul is feeling his oats, building his story and his reputation. As for Vince Gilligan, he learned from his mistakes and I think people are going to catch on and get hooked a lot faster this time around. This show has the same feel to it and things are only going to get bigger and better, so if you're putting off on watching it until you start hearing more hype, that's your choice, but you're missing out on some pretty good stuff.",1475625600,,2679,4.309523809523809

6302543,5,B00IXGU2TM,I was reluctant to start watching a spinoff show especially one that came from Breaking Bad which was so good itself . But I've learned that about 80% of the crew is the same from Breaking Bad . I really enjoyed the backstory from season one and found myself rooting for Jimmy . I can see how easy it is to get hooked on the show,1472428800,,329,4.0

6302557,4,B00IXGU2TM,"Here's where everyone hates me. Is the show good? Yes. Acting good? Yes. Plot? Good. What, then is my problem? I guess it's that I feel the storyline and production don't deserve the really high status it's been given. Again, why? Well, when I look back on some other really great series. I see , actually it's right in your face, that these others can do thirty or sometimes even forty episodes in a year and still have really great performances. This one, that I like (and will probably order once I'm over my petty feelings) ain't that great. I mean TEN episodes? How long before we get rid of Jimmy's brother? Face it ... the guy's a creep. There isn't anything that looks that difficult as far as moving things along. It's not like any of the actors have a real emotional commitment to their characters, is it? What's the problem, then? Don't they feel that the show is worthy of serious work? I don't know. Probably, I'm just miffed because we wait so long for so little. By the way, The character I like the most is Kim ... just hot...sammy",1470960000,,1047,4.430051813471502

6302564,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Surprisingly good series, actually better than ""breaking bad"" in my opinion. Great character study of the middle child, becomes tougher shyster lawyer. Although you don't agree with his path, you understand why he is on it, and can't stop watching. The hero is not goody goody but his flaws are those that draw your empathy, understanding and acceptance. You find yourself rooting for his success even though if he was your relative you would want to ""straighten him out"".

6302643,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Once again, the masterminds behind ""Breaking Bad"", are covering the issue of ""evil"" in the cleverest ways. Where in Breaking Bad they approached it from the angle of the downtrodden Walter White grasping fragments of evil, with outward progression, but inward descension, here, we have the returning face of Saul Goodman, prior to being Walter White's cohort, when he was Jimmy McGill. Jimmy, played by Bob Odenkirk superbly, is trying so hard to be good, but finds only failure, there. These are the profound questions of philosophy. Jimmy and Walter have skills in doing wrong, but what is the internal price paid for acting on that gifting. Oh! there's no preaching involved, but the beautiful tapestry of friends and family that surround these poor souls facing these questions of life. Mike(Jonathan Banks) returns and you get to see his back story and his struggles to do right or not. Over all, a masterpiece.",1463616000,,916,4.993464052287582

6302690,4,B00IXGU2TM,"Takes a while to get ""into"" but I find Better Call Saul to be an enjoyable show to watch. It suffers by comparison to Breaking Bad, for sure, since the pace of Saul is glacial compared to BB---except for very brief spurts. The law firm stuff is generally boring but I do greatly enjoy supporting actors like Mike and the crazy drug dealers. It's very interesting to see the old guy before he became crippled and his whack-a-mole nuts nephew who, one wonders, how he survives the 6 years until he encounters Walt since his behavior is so over the top even his underlings want to assassinate him. I'd have gone with 3.5 stars here, if I could, since 3 stars says ""mediocre"", which it isn't, but 4 stars says excellent, which it probably isn't---quite. No way 5 stars, which I reserve for a series that held me riveted and which I could watch time and time again. Saul ain't that good. If you watch the first 2-3 episodes and think it's too slow-paced and offbeat for you, the best I can say it does get better but THIS IS the pace of the show so if you really don't like that you probably won't ever really enjoy Saul.",1461628800,,1116,4.344497607655502

6302705,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Comparisons with the titanic Breaking Bad: are inevitable, since this show shares not only creator Vince Gilligan but is a spin off of some key characters  here in an origin story taking palace before Breaking Bad. But this new show  great in its own way  really is quite a different animal. Breaking Bad felt big, powerful, operatic. A Beethoven symphony of a show. While it had humor, the blasts of dark drama and tension dominated. Better Call Saul feels like more of a chamber piece, a string quartet, or a great trio. Quieter, more intimate, leaning more towards the comic, its themes about America and success are mostly fed with a wink, and not a punch to the stomach. The pace is slower too. This is a character study, and its content to allow us to just watch some very interesting people working through their strange funny/sad lives without pushing the plot along all that much. Its an outstanding show, but on its own terms, in its own way.

The acting is terrific. Bob Odenkirk creates a truly likable semi-sad sack with truly questionable morals and decision making ability, but a big heart. Jonathan Banks continues as one of the best television characters ever, his aging ex-cop a brilliant, cold, coiled snake, who always lets out just enough humanity to know that while this guy could kill you in a heartbeat if he had to, deep down hes a good guy, a loving grandfather, a moral man. Michael McKean does a great job as Odenkirks deeply disturbed brother. He will always be a smarter, better lawyer than Jimmy, he will always hold a grudge, and he is Odenkirks exact opposite. The guy who  on paper  we should feel bad for, but who is just icy and venal enough to keep us at an intrigued distance. If the character has a weak spot its that he can get a bit repetitive, but thats more a function of how the man is limited by his paranoid psychosis, not a limitation of acting or writing.

As with Breaking Bad the writing is specific, idiosyncratic, full of terrific dialogue that sounds naturalistic, but has just the right touch of poetry blended in. And as with its predecessor, the direction and cinematography is always at a high level, very cinematic, unafraid of staying in wide shots, or playing scenes in long takes instead of the rapid cutting that still dominates most TV  even very good TV. There are occasional lapses  I saw the twist ending of season 2 coming a mile off. But  if not as driven and instantly unforgettable as its parent show - this is intelligent, subtle and special television, not quite like anything else before or since.",1461110400,7,2570,4.628571428571429

Many of the other characters, unfortunately, are wicked dull. Ehrmantraut and the elder McGill are fan-dabby-dozy but no one else stands out yet.

I really liked ""Breaking Bad,"" and at the risk of comparing apples to oranges, I think I actually liked this show even better. Someone told me it's somewhat of a comedy, and I almost didn't start watching it because of that, as I normally don't enjoy comedies. No worries, not really comedic, though this show has its funny moments, primarily with dialog. I wonder if Bob Odenkirk comes up with some of that on his own, or if it's all out of the writers' room. Either way, it's wonderfully dark and intelligent. (A few times while watching, I've found myself googling words and terms I didn't know. So I guess it's actually educational!).

6302769,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Id say this is an even better experience if youve given up on Breaking Bad (yes, I know some of you out there found it too slow and couldn't get past Season Two and join the rest of us to the end). ""Better Call Saul"" stands on its own even if you know zip about the ""Breaking Bad"" world to come. Saul is a prequel to Bad and we learn that Saul is not even Saul's really name let alone his persona to be.

The violence is toned way down (although we do get some in here), and its more on how people become what they will become. Its also way more into the repartee and how Saul talks his way in and out of everythingand family and friendship w/o the annoying Walter White clan and Hanks sister. I just think they did a better casting job this time round esp. in the few female roles. Rhea Seehorn is a revelation and plays her role as Saul's confidant and fellow lawyer to perfection.

Of course, there are a bunch of new characters as well as keeping at least four I counted from ""Breaking Bad.""

Also, I actually find this one far more actually enjoyable because, lets face facts, a meth world is not nearly as interesting as a legal world. Its also not bogged down in procedural legalese at all so don't think it's ""L.A. Law"" in the new Mexican desert. Its more about how people deal with other people even beyond the courtroom scenes which are few really.

Plus it has enough quirkiness to keep it happeningSauls bro is played by Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins of Spinal Tap fame!) has a medical symptom we may have heard of but that has to be seen to believed.

The extras (especially the music video--say what?) were pretty good as well so do check out the DVD.",1458864000,,1669,4.268987341772152

6302771,1,B00IXGU2TM,This is terrible. Very disappointing. The character Saul is not strong enough to carry a whole episode yet alone a season (yet alone two seasons). He was fine when sprinkled through Breaking Bad because it was in small doses and he had excellent actors and writers all around him. Gilligan stretched himself too far here and lost a lot of credibility in my eyes,1458777600,,361,4.65625

6302792,5,B00IXGU2TM,"a spin that does it's own thing.  This could have easily been a disaster.  It's a fantastic drama that ties into breaking bad. Which was One of the best drama's of the last 20 years. Here we have the prequel story of the lawyer character and it's a good one. This is not a violent show though, And frankly breaking bad was often NOT a violent show either.  It was a drama and so is this.  This features emmy caliber performances from many of the people involved with it. And perhaps the best of them is the older brother character.  A man who knows his brothers inherent weaknesses and that he will fall into them and harm the law work which he sees as a honorable profession.  He loves his brother but knows he's too flawed not to go wrong.  The stories move fast in spite of being mainly a solid drama about a guy entering the law trade!.  We know he's going bad eventually but here we watch the whole story.  The blu ray set looks outtanding and has many good extras.  This one is another classic show that stays the dramatic course with finely written and acted tales of the mid 00's saul stories.",1457913600,,1101,4.300970873786408

6302805,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Being a fan of Breaking Ba since it first aired I was extremely excited to hear about the Spin Off Better Call Saul. Bob Odenkirk completely owns the character and is a huge part of its success. Of course the show is filmed with richly developed characters with Jonathan Banks reprising his role as Mike Ehrmantraut the man who takes no half measures.

This series does not disappoint an has every chance at becoming just as memorable as Breaking Bad. I find myself chomping at the bit to watch the next installment every week. Like Breaking bad, I had to own the series for two reasons, it's great and I want to be able to binge watch wherever I want to.

The series takes place a few years before Breaking bad to give a back story to many characters including Jimmy(Saul) and Mike. It's funny, intelligent writing and is so far above average for TV that it really deserves to be recognized as a theater based movie quality production.

The first season Blu Ray does not disappoint including some interesting extras along with a top quality presentation. It was a bit pricey for 10 episodes, but I waited for it to go on sale for $19.99. It's worth that price for such a great quality series that has replay value. If you love this series, this is an excellent set if you can find it at a good price.",1457308800,,1301,4.435146443514644

6302859,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Generally, spin off series tend to be ok but not as strong as the series from which they originated.  I didn't catch up with Better Call Saul for some time, because I assumed it would be so-so, but after watching season 1, I have to say that it's as good (although in a different way) as Breaking Bad.  Vince Gilligan was involved in the creation of both series, and he must be incredibly talented to pull this off.

Season 1 starts off a bit slow, not unlike Breaking Bad and several other great television series, and it's not simply as comic or absurd as you might assume based on Saul's character.  There is real depth and sophistication in the storytelling.  Saul's character has so many more layers than in Breaking Bad - he is certainly much more sympathetic if not interesting here.

I blew through season 1 - it's that good.  I highly recommend it to anyone, not just fans of Breaking Bad.",1456012800,,898,4.47239263803681
6302860,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Better Call Saul Season 1 is the best spinoff tv series that I have ever seen !! Vince Gilligan and his writing and producing partner, Jason Gould have created a very interesting back story for the minor character, Saul Goodman from the hit TV show, Breaking Bad. The back stories include: a complicated relationship with an OCD brother played by Michael McKean , a possible romantic relationship with another lawyer and co- worker and a conflicted relationship with the law. There is humor , pathos and some hilarious movie references like Ned Beatty's boardroom scene in ""Network"". Jonathan Banks is on hand to play the enforcer character that he played in Breaking Bad.
Highly recommended !!
Do not miss this one.",1456012800,3,716,4.925619834710743
6302861,5,B00IXGU2TM,"I almost gave up on this after episode 3, but so glad I didn't. After just finishing watching Breaking bad (Finally), I just couldn't shake not having Walt or Jessie around, even though, other than those two and Mike, Saul (Jimmy) is one of my absolute faves from BB. But trust me, folks, Saul is perfectly able to carry a show on his own merits, although having Mike Ehrmantraut  around doesn't hurt one little bit................unless you get on Mikes bad side. I really don't like lawyers or shows about lawyers.....................until now. The show gets better than the start..............much, much better. The writing is still the same, wonderful material from BB and the humor is spot on, as usual. I was questioning the intensity of the show at first, but it does pick up in the last 5 episodes but not to the bleak, dark level of BB. As a favor to the intelligent, discriminating viewer who wants much more than anything network tv offers...............don't give up on Saul, its well worth sticking around. And why would anyone need three guys for a job, when you have one Mike Ehrmantraut handy?  Stay with this, you'll find out.",1456012800,,1143,4.826530612244898

6302890,5,B00IXGU2TM,"...you don't have to have been on the  ""Breaking Bad"" bandwagon to appreciate ""Better Call Saul""; you just have to enjoy a TV series that combines intelligent writing, a skillful mix of the witty and ominous and quirky characters who will have you rooting for --and against-- them in spite of your self.

Set primarily in Albuquerque, season one offers a non-linear reveal of the metamorphosis of Chicago-area of Jimmy McGill from small time scam artist into his New Mexico persona of shady criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. Along the way, we are treated to wonderful interactions with New Mexican criminals, a nemesis button-down law firm (HHM)...where his freind/love interest Kim works, and where is brother Chuck is also a partner...but is on hiatus while he deals with his aversion to electromagnetic waves. Also along for the ride is Mike, the fixer from Breaking Bad as his arrival there is explored (with some Philly detectives in pursuit).

Don't worry about the timeline: sit back and enjoy what is revealed, and the pieces will fall into place. The 50-minute episodes are perfect for a winter binge watch in preparation for Season 2 (which premiers on the day this review is being posted...).",1455494400,,1199,4.985

6302902,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Quite amazing. It's rare to find a film, much less a TV show, with a lead character who's in the process of evolving morally from a scam artist to the realization that he's happiest by being himself and helping others. Really inspiring, and on a very regular basis, hugely funny. A lovely, human story that's told from a God's-eye perspective. You can't help loving Jimmy regardless of his flaws. We'd all be better off in a world where our moral fate isn't determined by our present mistakes but the direction we're headed. There are some incredibly moving scenes that I won't soon forget - especially at the brief moments when Jimmy loses sight of what really makes him happy, for example, when he walks through the monstrous vacant office he plans to rent and realizes that ... this isn't it. We share his tears. But in this script there's no dwelling on the dark moments; thankfully, Jimmy's right back at it, advocating for his clients and showing his basic decency and good heart. Hurrah for the filmmakers; this is more than a TV show, it's a work of art, and I can't help believing the writers and actors and cinematographers had a great deal of fun and derived big-time satisfaction at the end.

6302915,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Like many, many others I was delighted when I heard that Vince Gilligan was writing another series after Breaking Bad,, this one a prequel about Saul Goodman.  I was really eager to see it and I wasn't disappointed.

Wow...there's so much to say about it.  First, the writing is just as good as in Breaking Bad.  Secondly, the actors are terrific!  I could write paragraphs just about Bob Odenkirk's performance!  In BB he was one-dimensional, a clown, a jerk, almost a caricature of a sleazy lawyer.  Here he is a complete, whole person.  And what a love, he is.  Odenkirk still has the snappy patter down.  ""Showtime!"" he tells himself in the mens' room mirror with his upbeat gestures.  He's so good at that.  But what grips your heart is the sweet, vulnerable side that we never saw before.  Odenkirk has great facial expressions, showing a vast range of feelings, from glee to rage to hearbreak.  He's really a fine actor..  And he uses his body wonderfully.  Sometimes there's the cocky walk and other times he's the stoop shouldered shlump.

The relationships are beautifully  written in both series.  Here they are played up more and there's less of the violence, which suits me fine.  The relationship between ""Jimmy"" who later becomes Saul and Chuck, his successful, older brother is very interesting.  I almost want a prequel to this series to explain how those two got that way!

The relationship with Kim, the beautiful lawyer is equally interesting and a nice break from the solemnity of a lot of the show.  We get the idea that they had a romance at one time and are now just good friends, but they retain a degree of affection and caring for each other that is heartening to see.  Jimmy is not just a slick huckster.  At least not here.  Here he's the real deal---a man who puts himself out for her welfare and for that of his brother. I loved the scene in the nail salon where he gives Kim a pedicure while telling her about the talking toilet!

Everyone's happy to see Mike, again, another favorite from BB.  At first he's just the toll booth taker at the parking lot but we know that he's meant for better things, in life and in this show.  Soon a whole episode is devoted to him, which explains a lot about how ""he got that way.""  It's all well done.

Knowing what will eventually happen to Jimmy/Saul and Mike, it's a little painful to watch.  I'd almost prefer not to know as we root for this crazy but good hearted guy who tries to so hard, against amazing odds, to make it in the world.  I do hope that there's life for him after Cinnabuns!  Maybe another sequel, Vince?!

Meanwhile I'm looking forward greatly to Season Two.",1454803200,,2649,4.540254237288136

6302988,5,B00IXGU2TM,"If you were sad to see Breaking Bad end, you're in luck, my friend. Better Call Saul is shaping up to be every bit as good as we get the back story of Saul and especially Mike. But it's got its own rich world with antagonists that create the Saul Goodman we know and love. So Jimmy McGill starts out as a good guy with a conscience. How did he become Saul Goodman, a walking, talking catalog of ethical misconduct? The first season describes that arc, and the viewer is expecting something different from him after the season end.",1453766400,,530,4.363636363636363

Just as addictive as Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul grabs you in a different way entirely and it holds your attention firmly fixed while you step through the looking glass and follow Saul as he reviews his past while enduring his present.

It's a fascinating trip down memory lane as we see how he struggled against his inclinations to cut corners to get to Easy Street while still being a kind and compassionate human being and struggling against those facets of his personality, feeling that they are a hindrance to his getting to that place in life when money pours over him like a waterfall.  We can't wait to see what next season will reveal, but it's certain that there will be more hilarity and heart tugging moments while we accompany Saul down Memory Lane while waiting for his big score to arrive.",1453680000,,995,4.420765027322404

6303028,5,B00IXGU2TM,"BCS has been a joy to watch so far. The slow evolution of Jimmy McGill into pre-Saul Goodman has many twists and turns. Every character on the show is portrayed flawlessly, and the mini-plots for each episode play well into each other. Many small choices turn into one great big collapsing in the final episode. A must-see for any Breaking Bad fan, and a continuation of the New Mexico drama that is true to its roots.

While it hasn't lived up to Breaking Bad yet, I don't expect it to do so in only the first season. BB became a sensation with the Gus conflict in season's 3 and 4. I expect great things from BCS in future seasons.",1453075200,,633,4.319327731092437

Yes, obviously the actors behind Breaking Bad have aged quite a bit (especially Mike) but since I already have so much love for the characters and the universe I was happy to ignore that and just be absorbed by the story.  And like always, Vince Gilligan delivers.

Saul is a polar opposite to Walt but the show still is fantastic and Odenkirk delivers another hilarious and yet heart wrenching performance of the lovable, crooked scoundrel who desperately wants to be a successful lawyer but events outside of his control keep forcing him down the same rabbit hole that Walt will someday travel.

Anymore about the character will become a spoiler. However, there is much humor which is a nice touch added to this complex character.
 I didn't watch the the series as it aired first time around. Friends said that I was missing a great new show. With two shows left I decided not to begin watching and try to play catch up. I purchased the first season on it's first day the complete set (10 episodes and bonus features) was available and to my surprise I watched all episodes straight through with great delight.  Now the second season is about to begin and as I am a great fan of this show I will not miss the opportunity to watch from the beginning. This was an opportunity  I didn't have last season.
I really want to know how far the writers will take Saul away from his self image of not being a criminal but a criminal attorney (or are they the same ?)  and how he will justify his creative career change.
Either way Saul is such an interesting character in a great series. Season one should not be missed as it does lay a great foundation for what should be a great second season.",1452211200,,1247,4.285106382978723

Millions tuned in weekly to AMC from February to April in 2015 to see Bob Odenkirk star as Jimmy McGill and watch the start of McGill's metamorphosis into Saul Goodman.  This DVD set contains all ten episodes from Season One.

The first season sees Jimmy as a struggling rookie lawyer in Albuquerque, and his character evinces many contradictions--awkward at times and confident in others, and ruthless in spots and good in others.  Jimmy's interactions and strained relationships with the other characters in this first season set him on the beginnings of his course to becoming Saul, and the season finale leaves no doubt as to where Jimmy is ultimately headed.

""Better Call Saul"" introduces several other compelling characters, and it will also be fascinating to see what becomes of them in ensuing seasons.  As with ""Breaking Bad,"" the writing and cinematography are both excellent--the scenes of the desert are again great, and as with the parent show the camera angles used to help tell the story are superb.  Black humor and subtle humor are other features that this show shares with its predecessor.

The special features on this DVD include interviews with series creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould and with star Bob Odenkirk on the production of the show.  Gilligan and Gould have come up with another winner, and Season One lays the groundwork for what looks to be another instant classic.  I eagerly anticipate the rest of the series.",1451865600,12,1733,5.505660377358491

6303069,2,B00IXGU2TM,"I really wanted to love this series and I had heard good comments. I was seriously disappointed, no one expected
Breaking Bad"", and there is no doubt Vince Gilligan's style is interesting, but the series suffers from sequel or prequelitis---a pale reproduction  of aspects of the original. Stories are slight, character development is laboured and often contrived and despite the fine work of Bob Odenkirk as Saul, it is Mike who makes the story interesting and there is just not enough of him and far too much of Saul's meanderings none of which amount to much. Gilligan is a genius writer and creator and director, he should b e turning his talents to feature films or something less flimsy than this PS the Final episode which could have sold me, is the least interesting episode of the whole series.",1450396800,,803,4.776978417266187

Before he became Saul, though, he was Jimmy McGill and he wanted to do the right thing despite his hustler past, but his past branded him for life no matter how hard he tried. Carpark attendant Mike Ehrmantrauts explosive past comes to light in detail, and he sets his sights on new ventures. A business association begins to brew between Mike and Jimmy, and there is no way the future can be squeaky clean with such a pair.

I first started watching Better Call Saul when it first came out and I was not that impressed with the pilot episode. It starts with a clip of Saul post Breaking Bad and then cuts back to a rather pathetic court case and Mike Ehrmantraut as a parking attendant. It seemed like a stretch. Then there was the restaurant scene with Julie and Craig Kettleman which was a little pathetic. But then as the season progresses it gets more interesting. More and more characters from Breaking bad creep in. The writing is solid.",1445990400,3,795,4.445205479452055

Just as with my experience with TWD I came to Breaking Bad very late in the game and ended up bingewatching all of the seasons in just 2 weeks on Netflix and Prime after the final season aired.

I was a little leery of this show at first-- Breaking Bad is one of the most brilliant shows ever made, so I just wasn't sure how they could build a spin-off around a supporting character, even as enjoyable as Saul Goodman was on BB. Better Call Saul has completely exceeded my hopes and expectations. The story of Jimmy McGill, the man who would become Saul Goodman, is funny, poignant, and just as brilliant as Breaking Bad. Bob Odenkirk is a revelation-- he fills the part with humor, pathos, and such weary sarcasm that it's impossible not to root for him.

I love this show, and cannot wait for Season 2.",1444867200,,627,4.452173913043478

6303209,5,B00IXGU2TM,"I was fully prepared to be disappointed by this show since Breaking Bad was about as good as a TV series can possibly get. Bob Odenkirk is a hilarious actor, but I didn't know if the writers could base a whole show on him and still reach the high level of quality that characterized BB. As it turns out, there was no need to worry. Vince Gilligan and his crew have begun what, by all accounts, looks like another big hit, and they've done it with many a nod to BB, but without relying on it as a crutch. Take the first couple episodes. The show needed to start with a bang, so they bring in Tuco to menace our hero, Jimmy McGill, and to achieve a bit of the darkness of BB. But after episode 2, we see that Tuco won't be a series regular, and that the first two episodes were meant to establish Jimmy's central conflict of figuring which side of the law he wants to operate on. From that point on, the show bears many similarities to other successful law shows, notably offering the same quirky humor as Boston Legal. But the deep back-stories of Saul and his future partner in crime, Mike Ehrmantraut, lend a resonance to the show through their implications for events on Breaking Bad. And while the ensemble cast might not yet be quite as strong as BB, it seems to be getting there. The critical and popular acclaim for Season 1 has caught the attention of certain BB alums who've expressed interest in appearing on Saul, and the show has to, at some point, delve into Mike's employment with Gus Fring. With so much material to mine for the upcoming seasons, I think Better Call Saul will end up being one of those rare spin-offs that reaches a level at least close to that of its parent show. Season 2 should see the series truly break out.",1444521600,,1743,4.3496932515337425
6303210,3,B00IXGU2TM,"The first episode of Better Call Saul was pretty boring, with nothing much happening until the skateboard con artists make an appearance near the end. To be honest if I hadn't enjoyed Breaking Bad so much I probably would have stopped watching after about half an hour. The second episode which is the aftermath of those decisions with the skateboarders was easily the best of all ten on the DVD, and the closest the show ever got to resembling Breaking Bad's quality. Breaking Bad was a show that sometimes had long drawn out even at times boring scenes between the great TV scenes, but Better Call Saul seems to have a lot more of them and never really reaches the quality of Breaking Bad with it's own good scenes. There are though occasionally some interesting scenes and other characters, his brother who can't cope with electricity or being outside stealing a newspaper, then (and a bit ridiculously) the cops turning up after that was interesting but for the most part his scenes are just filler. Besides Saul we're also seeing the prequel Albuquerque Breaking Bad world of Mike (Jonathan Banks) who we initially visit as a parking lot boom gate operator who won't show any flexibility to Saul's mistakes with validating his parking card. For the most part, he is not that interesting a character in this series, although there is one good episode where he takes on some casual work as a bodyguard who doesn't need a gun even though the client and others think it is a must.

Some scenes are a bit predictable such as the billboard one, and there's far too many sudden flashbacks where we catch on to the fact as Saul (or Jimmy as he known) has a bigger mullet type of hairstyle. We're already watching a prequel, do we need to visit a prequel world to the prequel so often?

Better Call Saul is watchable, and although I won't rush out to get season 2, I will eventually watch it, but this show simply wasn't as entertaining or clever as I had imagined it would be.",1444435200,2,1973,4.586402266288951

Better Call Saul is great in all the ways Breaking Bad is great, but it's also lighter and less hopeless without being at all sentimental or simplistic. The development of character is subtle and believable as Jimmy slowly becomes himself by coming to terms with all of his own nuances, including the ones he is afraid to face.

Just read any of the 1 star reviews. I suggest not wasting your hard earned money on this failure of a show. It should be free to Prime members. I made the mistake of only reading its many 5 star ratings, which was a huge mistake since many were on the BB bandwagon and were putting this on the same pedestal (There is no comparison). I later found that the 1 and 3 star ratings were much more accurate, and repetitively pointed out the reality of this shows many short comings.

But they did it, Better Call Saul is a worthy successor to Breaking Bad. Imagine a sort of Jesse and Walt dynamic where (Jesse is jimmy McGiil) except this time the show follows Jesse's struggle to impress Walt (Walt is a number of people in the show). Now add on the rise of other favorite characters from Breaking Bad, and the return of Albuquerque, and this show is easily a must watch for its complex character arcs, and perfect mix of comedy and drama.",1441584000,,601,4.626168224299065

We didn't imagine it would be so sensitive - Jimmy is slick in his low level con games but not a bad guy, not evil at all. You root for him when he bags a pigeon.

I thought the character of Saul was hilarious comic relief from some of the grim business in Breaking Bad, But I aslo thought he was not multifaceted enough to carry a show. I clearly underestimated the talents of Vince Gilligan, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathon Banks, and the rest of the crew in their ability to spin a tale. The episode that explained how and why Mike went rogue was particularly affecting. My advice, Better Watch Saul.",1440201600,,504,4.611111111111111

6303396,5,B00IXGU2TM,It's so good.  Does anyone else think that Bob Odenkirk looks a bit like Ray Bolger as the scarecrow in the 1939 Wizard of Oz?  I think that's one reason I like Bob and of course because he is such a sleazy softie at heart.

Don't worry I won't give any spoilers. My only disappoint with the series (and most series these days) is they only have 10 episodes a season and you have to wait almost a year for season 2! Miss the days when you only had to wait during the summer for new seasons to start. But anyways, this is supposed to be a review of the show. I ordered in regular not HD and the quality is still just as good on an HD tv. The show only got 4 stars though because of the short season, and because it could have been a little more intense.

6303570,3,B00IXGU2TM,"Disappointing. I'm something of a Breaking Bad agnostic  seasons 1 and 2 are exceptional, but IMO in seasons 3-5 the plot went from being driven by compelling character-based ethical quandaries into a convoluted logic puzzle based on a narrow minded causality that felt largely removed from actual lived life. Saul Goodman was a consistent highlight, however: the brilliantly amoral id of the show, the antithesis of Anna Gunn's hypocritical moralizing Skyler, and the one man who embraced the shabbiness of a criminal life and the intimations of mediocrity that it evokes.

So BCS seemed promising  the adventures of Saul in the world of criminal lawyering, rumored to occur concurrently with the events of the original show. However, BCS turns out to be an apologia for the character in the form of an origin story about a minutely small time hustler (Slipping Jimmy) who tries to live up to the moral/professional standards of his successful brother (Michael McKean, in an enervating turn), only to find himself drawn into shady criminality when his best efforts lead him to poverty and betrayal. There is the requisite upstanding love interest (a meh Rhea Seehorn, who strikes me as a good actress in the wrong show), the small-time hustler friend who represents the past he can't escape (which involved hoary scams even David Mamet would roll his eyes at), and the constant flashbacks to the past that distractingly require us to buy into a timeline that seemingly makes no sense given the age of the actors (the time between Jimmy leaving Chicago and passing the bar would have us believe that he's currently about 32 years old, and McKean at most in his 40s). The character is so dilluted by the efforts to make him relatable (uggh) that we lose all sense of the clarity and pragmatism that Odenkirk injected into the original show  this is Saul Goodman as a good guy who just had a few bad breaks, and geeze don't we feel kind of bad for him.

The other major character, the beloved BB alum Mike Ermhantraut, is similarly presented as a gallant man of unfair circumstance: he guns down his stand-up cop son's absurdly corrupt partners, then flees to ABQ to care for his granddaughter and widowed daughter-in-law. The revisionism works a bit better with him, since the broad strokes of the character's fundamental honor have been well established, but his story thus far in ABQ is deeply uninteresting, and I can't say I feel better about the character now than when I thought of him just as a principled killer with a vague family obligation.

Anyway, I'll probably give the show another shot in season 2, but although I'm giving it 3 Stars owing to its relatively superior quality in a world of mostly unwatchable television, I can't actually recommend it at all. I sort of wish I hadn't wasted 8 hours watching it. There wasn't a single episode I'd watch again, and short of accepting it as a gift, I don't think I'd ever want to own it on Blu Ray.

I love Vince Gilligan  from X-Files to BB, he's been one of the best dramatic television writers in America. But this show feels less brazen and more commercially compromised than did BB. Perhaps with the freedom of high viewership and great reviews he can steer the show into a more uncompromising direction. Breaking Bad leapt into the stratosphere in Season 2, so I guess I'm hopeful.",1435449600,6,3347,4.788561525129983

6303581,4,B00IXGU2TM,"Halfway through the season.  This is certainly an enjoyable show and the dialogue, as on Breaking Bad, is smart and funny in a way that people think dialogue is in Quentin Tarrentino films, but, for my money, the repartee from Vince Gilligan and his team is actually far wittier, because more germane to the story, than from the overrated QT.  And some interesting story arcs are being established, particularly with Mike and with Saul's brother, who may or may not suffer from EMF sensitivity (which the writers, unfortunately, are very poorly informed about--perhaps they were worried about offending cell phone sponsors).  And just as on BB, the camerawork is innovative and compelling (e.g. the juice cart cam, the floor mat cam, the inside of Saul's left shoot cam--ok, I made the last one up).  All that said, I have to say that what were always virtues on Breaking Bad sometimes are overindulged to the point of vice--certain conversations do go on too long, almost as if they are filler for a lack of good plot, and even their original nature can't hide the sense of the writers playing for time. The same might be said of certain montage sequences--Saul prepping for case after PD case doesn't hold a candle to the chemical intricacies of Meth confabulation, guys; there's just no vicarious thrill to it.  So here's hoping that the show develops more of its own identity as it evolves and that its story arcs are compelling for its entire series run.",1435276800,,1459,4.796812749003984

6303601,4,B00IXGU2TM,"Saul Goodman was a colorful character in Breaking Bad. He deserves his own story told. A sleazy, chatty, dishonest lawyer, an ambulance chaser in Albuquerque. We knew already that he wasn't Jewish at all, and that his real name was McGill. Why has Jimmy turned into Saul?
Surprise: at the end of season 1, Jimmy is still not Saul. We see where it might be heading in season 2, but we saw that already before we watched a single episode of season 1.
The strength of Breaking Bad returns in Better Call Saul: the main characters are ambivalent, contradictory people. Jimmy is a petty criminal by nature, but inside him, something struggles to be good, to do the right thing, to make an honest career and become a star of the profession, like his big brother. Obstacles are plenty.
While our sympathies with Walter White started from a solid basis of tragic bad luck, Jimmy McGill can't claim the same clean starting basis. He was Slipping Jimmy to begin with.

Frankly, my preferred hero in this series isn't Jimmy/Saul. My Prussian soul sympathizes more with Mike Ehrmantraut, the former dirty Philadelphia cop, who moved to New Mexico for mixed reasons (be near his grandchild & run from a murder investigation), and who earns money as a freelance enforcer/body guard etc.
Mike has clear ideas about professional ethics. Hired to find a stolen stash of 1.5 million dollars, he does just that, he finds and delivers. Keeping it isn't part of his world.
Mike is the living embodiment of nomen est omen: the name contains the nouns 'Ehre' = honor, and 'Mann'= man. The third syllable 'traut' isn't equally clear. It might be derived from courage or from trust. Either way: Mike is a man of honor and courage, and we trust him. Unless he was hired by the opposition.",1434672000,,1762,4.702265372168285

6303634,3,B00IXGU2TM,"""Saul"" as a character in ""Breaking Bad"" was terrific! As the main character in this show, well I'm not sure if it's worth purchasing a second season. I no doubt will but I certainly am hoping the writing becomes much better! I do not believe the production is developing ""Saul"" quickly enough. My guess is they are planning to stretch it out so maybe they can drag out another couple of unnecessary seasons. Hey, I know they are business to make money and I don't have any issues with that! But, it has to improve or it won't be my money for season 3+!!",1433980800,,553,4.326923076923077
6303635,4,B00IXGU2TM,"I like this show because it makes Saul so very real- human emotions that we can all empathize with.  The directors may have thrown this together a bit too quickly- very choppy at times and you have to make assumptions about what you THINK may be going on.  But, you definitely feel for poor Saul and want to tune in again to see his continuing plight.",1433894400,,351,4.303030303030303

6303640,5,B00IXGU2TM,"Outstanding. Not as evil as breaking bad but just as tense, compelling and our beloved lawyer takes on all the depth you might expect from a Vince Gilligan creation. Rhea Seahorn, a Wahsington, DC, actress breaking the big time in LA does a great job as a new character, and seeing familiar characters, such as the beloved Mike Ehrmantraut, is such a treat. I worried this would be a shallow romp. It is much more. I am only disappointed that they may not keep it up for long. I could take a decade of this show easily.",1433894400,,519,4.360824742268041

However, I have found myself very confused by several of the flash backs, especially in the first three to four episodes. As episodes progress I am understanding the story line better, but do need to go back to review previous events to make sense of the current episode occasionally.
There is also some confusion, as well as some  aha moments, with references in terms of events that occurred in Breaking Bad.
So, I would say I mostly enjoy the program, but do have to work at trying to figure out just what is happening when. A bit of plus/minus for program in general.",1433721600,,677,4.595041322314049

I don't want to give even the slightest spoiler hint, so let me just say that the creators have taken the Breaking Bad story and created another that blends perfectly, and in a very original way. If you are so much as a moderate Breaking Bad fan you will not only enjoy this series, you will respect the creativeness. In no way is it just a cheap knock-off of the original to cash in on the success. We get plenty of that every summer from Hollywood. NOT THIS!!

If you haven't watched the entire Breaking Bad series I suggest you do that before starting Better Call Saul. That said, if you never heard of Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul could stand on its own. I would still recommend watching Breaking Bad first though.",1432944000,,800,4.594405594405594
