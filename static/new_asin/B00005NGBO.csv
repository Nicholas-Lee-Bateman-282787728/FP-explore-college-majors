7947044,5,B00005NGBO,"Ethel is one of my favorite Kennedy's, and this is the only video that is out there about her life. It includes interviews with some of her children and with the author of Ethel's biography, The Other Mrs. Kennedy. There is rare footage of her being interviewed sometime in the 70's and also at her home during RFK's senatorial campaign. This is a must for anyone who likes Ethel Kennedy.",1263513600,,388,4.557142857142857
