6679758,1,B00NT961JS,"This is no exception. The challenge is to make it human and embarrassing. Good humor needs to avoid at all costs simply being talking points. That's exactly what this is and it isn't funny. It's the same with leftist comics who have an axe to grind.  Miller was once shamelessly hilarious and he's completely lost touch with that drive and replaced it with partisan politics scripting. There is literally no moment in the show you don't see coming so badly, you almost can't believe people are laughing, or even reacting to what they consider punchlines. Everything is so rote you've already been there before he says it. Honestly, it doesn't even seem worth it anymore for Miller. It doesn't even matter what he's getting paid. He's done and he's been done for some time based on this work. I will be looking to the past for Dennis Miller comedy from now on because he's not a comedian anymore.",1443139200,2,895,4.6645569620253164

6679765,1,B00NT961JS,"This tedious tory spews boring pedantic prattle. Whenever he attempts clever comedy, he tries to impress the gullible with arcane historical references and vocabulary. Vocabulary might be the opiate of some people... dumb people that is.

Dennis Miller is NOT funny and but he IS very wrong.
Miller is a right-wing pseudo-intellectual.

He has regular spots on FOX news. I rest my case.",1420156800,6,386,5.111111111111111
6679766,5,B00NT961JS,Classic Dennis Miller.  Great material all the way through but really nails the ending.,1499472000,,87,5.214285714285714
6679767,5,B00NT961JS,"Listen, he is one of the smartest comics standing. The one and two star reviews are from people who place political ideology in front of a sense of humor. I know that sounds incongruous, but they are clearly offended at his ability to not only become self-deprecating, but pointing the finger at all sides. My advice is to watch it and enjoy it for what it is; a smart man pointing out the foibles and screw-ups we have to offer. For those others, let them stew in their own juices and curse the darkness. One has to be a pragmatist in this world - ideology is one of the worst things that serves to divide and conquer.",1499385600,,619,4.299145299145299
6679768,1,B00NT961JS,"I guess he didn't age well. My gosh, this routine was like watching paint dry, discount paint, from Dollar General. Horrible. It was obvious that he didn't even want to be there. I got about a third of the way through, and couldn't take anymore. If you like Dennis Miller, stick with his older stuff.",1498780800,2,300,4.472727272727273
6679769,1,B00NT961JS,"I used to love his routines.  He had a fresh and incisive slant to current events and heaven knows he has an impressive vocabulary.  He definitely doesn't dumb it down for you but this film shows that even the best eventually run out of gas.  The first fifteen minutes he reminded me of an old geezer yelling at kids to get off of his lawn.  He does skewer the right as well as the left and even though he saves most of his venom for the Left, he still manages to find something to criticize in all spectrums of the body politic.  Its just too bad that most of his material is not funny and most  of the time he commits the cardinal sin of comics:  he tries to hard with no payoff.  I will just go back on YT and enjoy his earlier stuff.  Dennis, you had a great run but its time to hang it up.",1498176000,4,794,3.9746835443037973
6679770,2,B00NT961JS,"There were some really funny parts, and I like his delivery.  He's just too far right and too angry for me to enjoy his entire show anymore.  Nevertheless, probably worth the watch if you're not offended by liberal-bashing.  Dennis could take just a little more balanced approach and have much broader appeal.  I don't have to agree with someone to enjoy them, but he's a little bit over-the-top for my tastes.",1497744000,5,410,4.732394366197183

8680085,2,B00NT961JS,"Through his work on Weekend Update, Miller is probably one of the most prolific comedians and the single-most influential TV presenter in the last thirty years. As non-scripted programming with personality-based narrating has fully shaped the lineups of cable, radio and now online programming, Miller's satirical model allowed producers to own and edit the news with a more personal brand and make it palatable to a broader array of audiences, topics and distribution channels. His post-9/11 conversion to initially diplomatic and then social and fiscal conservatism was fully sincere and his lack of discernible ethnic, gender or specific moral biases helped decontaminate their rhetorical roster against the likes of Limbaugh, Beck and Coulter. Unfortunately, Miller has sacrificed his sardonic, allegorical and narrative gifts to topics and ideas that are already metastasized to every nook of journalism and entertainment, and lacking the style and finesse of a Carlin, has squandered any chance of being a compelling or entertaining comedian to a sufficiently broad or non-ideological audience.",1530576000,,1100,5.672727272727273

8680091,3,B00NT961JS,"Wife and I have been fans of Dennis since his SNL days. Unfortunately, focusing your entire routine on politics is often a sure course towards ending ones stand-up career.

We were happy to see this was made available free with Prime as we had not seen much of Dennis over the past few years. My Wife has better staying power than I do and I found myself dozing off during most of the show. Granted I am an oldster well into the 2nd half of my 60s decade, but I simply found the skit way too focused on politics and a bit dull on the delivery (sorry Dennis).

For anyone who thinks my politics rule my review, sorry to disappoint you. I am more of a Libertarian than anything else so it isn't my political persuasion that brings me to the conclusion that this simply was not one of Dennis's better routines.",1518134400,2,807,4.302631578947368
