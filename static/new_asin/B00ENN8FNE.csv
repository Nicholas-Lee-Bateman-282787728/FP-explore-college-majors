5928369,5,B00ENN8FNE,"This is a brilliant show.

The first time you watch an episode, you laugh so hard you fall off your seat.
The second time you watch it, you become amazed with how much in the episode actually happened.
The third time you see it, you start laughing again.",1393459200,,254,4.291666666666667
5928370,5,B00ENN8FNE,"What can I say- the comedy value hitting off the vague history references is entertaining. A great series if you're looking for crazy, endearing characters with a jumpy comedic plot.",1391126400,3,182,5.1
5928371,5,B00ENN8FNE,I'm so glad they finally did a complete series for world series. It has all of season 3 and 4 episodes and it looks great next to my Axis powers collection and paint it white movie. I LOVE HETALIA!!!,1390953600,2,199,4.128205128205129

5928373,5,B00ENN8FNE,"I have watched the series itself many times and there are many funny moments and other moments that will make you think ""Wait! Did they really just...?"" in a positive way. The extras are awesome too! There are about 4 commentaries from the english voice actors on each of the main discs and there are outtakes and some of the Japanese Fan Events and such on the Extras discs. Totally worth the purchase!",1389052800,11,403,4.534246575342466
5928374,5,B00ENN8FNE,"I feel world series has a lot more stuff and characters than axis powers, so its naturally my favorite. Theres more Prussia and Spain and Romano! Theres war of austrian succesion (its hilarious!),  christmas around the world and lots of Japan & America. United States of Hetalia is funny as well. My favorite scenes were Crotch cloth and the one with all the nordics! Overall theres a lot more going on!!!",1388534400,7,405,4.704225352112676

5928390,5,B00ENN8FNE,"To those new to Hetalia Axis powers Seasons 1 &2 are the beginning section of hetalia, world series 3 & 4 continue from there. I know it's a bit confusing but I've been into hetalia for many many years now and I have discovered this to be true. Thats is why ""The beautiful world"" starts at Season 5.
You aren't being cheated out of anything, and I would say this is a bargain. When I bought season 4 alone it was 30$ in store! So if i'm able to buy 2 for about 40$, it's a steal! I will be buying Paint it white and Axis powers and Beautiful world soon to finish my physical copy collection!

For parents:
Hetalia is a little mild in my taste its definitely about PG TV-15 when it comes to ratings. Some curses are used and some contents are suggestive. But no sexual things are really present in hetalia. It is pretty offensive t those with no humor; seeing it as all countries are portrayed as a super-mond-sized stereotypical person from that country. ie: America is loud, obnoxious, in charge and eats too much, France is a pervert who drinks wine and ""smells like cheese"". But its all in good humor and isn't meant to be truly offensive to any country. Each episode is 5 minuets long and you get about 28-30 episodes each season. which is about almost 2 hours of episodes each season. It has credits abotu half way through so don't get worried.

I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys goofy anime-- but if you want teh entire series, buy Axis powers since it does come first. Then world series.",1446854400,,1505,4.371428571428571

5928395,5,B00ENN8FNE,Very good.  Best seasons in my opinion. Worth my parents money to buy it for me.,1441497600,,80,4.0

God Being an otaku really drains your money.
Anyway, it's a fun Anime, not for everyone. Does teach you some stuff history and Geography. Eater 17+ on YouTube. I don't really know what to say. It came in good condition.. No real complaints.",1441238400,,268,4.723404255319149

5928399,5,B00ENN8FNE,"As someone with a great love for Hetalia, this was a great find! I love the anime, it's very funny, and it's good for people who just want a silly show that doesn't take itself too seriously.
The product arrived in really great condition, and the disks were great! It was also awesome finding the entire series, so I didn't have to go around searching for the individual seasons. I enjoyed my time with the countries of Hetalia :D",1437955200,3,430,4.455696202531645
5928400,5,B00ENN8FNE,Love these seasons!,1437782400,,19,5.666666666666667
5928401,5,B00ENN8FNE,"My daughter loves this series.  I would say it's for teens.  While it says ""complete series"" -- look at the boxes' small print carefully, because there are a lot of seasons of this and as far as I know, they whole series isn't in any one boxed set.  Anyway, this is a very tongue-in-cheek view of WWII, for entertainment purposes only (though at least she now knows who was involved and where the alliances were--) and I would say that you may want to see if you can experience Hetalia elsewhere (you tube?) first before shelling out the money for this-- I think some people would find it offensive, but they do tease all nationalities equally and for anyone that has a good sense of humor and isn't too sensitive, they would probably find it it entertaining (Each country is personified in a hyper-stereotypical way into one character-- For example, America is a burger eater... slightly lazy.  Italy says ""make pasta, not war!"", etc.)",1435622400,6,936,4.689024390243903
5928402,5,B00ENN8FNE,"I ordered a used product, and it came on time. The case is a bit broken, but it still closes and works properly. It's amazing. All the discs work, and Hetalia is just amazing.",1434931200,,175,4.176470588235294

5928408,5,B00ENN8FNE,"Oh my god, i am a HUGE hetalia fan now, personally, i like the english dub better, just my preferences, but it comes with 4 cds, season 3, season 3 extras, season 4, and season 4 extras. My parents weren't all that thrilled to buy it, they were all like,""It's a waste of money, you'll watch it once, then it'll sit about doing absolutely nothing."" and ""Don't waste your money on that crap!"" But i can guarantee it is ANYTHING but crap. I watched it several times. (and i still go back and rewatch it)  So, about two hours, and several arguments later, i bought it.",1423699200,5,564,4.320754716981132

5928411,5,B00ENN8FNE,"This series is hilarious and educational, I actually answered Jeopardy questions because of what I learned form Hetalia. If you want a great comedy with a historical twist, plus cats, this one it for you.",1421452800,,204,4.857142857142857
5928412,5,B00ENN8FNE,SO AWESOME!!! (But not as awesome as Prussia....) It is exactly as the description says. Season four is super funny and amazing to watch and laugh.,1421452800,,147,4.6923076923076925

5928419,5,B00ENN8FNE,"Bought at sales price during Black Friday Sale, very happy,  I decided to buy. World series expands beyond World War II so we see more countries like Spain and Greece. It also includes the popular mini cat episodes. DVD came in a reasonable amount of time, only a day late from estimated time of arrival. It was new at the time of purchase and delivery did not damage the DVD. Disks come with selective commentary from the dub crew on  certain episodes and had recorded convention footage with original Japanese voice actors that I enjoyed.  It also comes with a general history overview of the included episodes if you want to know more about them. Liked being able to play the short episodes all at once without interruption as well as skip around for my favorite bits. I found it well worth the buy as a fan as this covers half the series with this animation team.",1419811200,4,867,4.509554140127388

5928424,3,B00ENN8FNE,"When I bought this I thought I was getting the Complete Series, as it says that on the cover. In little words at the bottom however, it says ""Seasons 3 and 4"". Now I have to find Season 1 and 2. Rather frustrating.
Being new to Hetalia,I was surprised that each episode is about 5 mintues long then it goes into closing credits and then into opening credits for the next episode. That was weird at first, but is okay now. I thought season four was way funnier than season three. This wasn't a bad dvd at all to introduce me to Hetalia.",1407283200,21,535,4.203883495145631

5928429,5,B00ENN8FNE,"This is great, I loved the subbed and the dubbed is even better.  I've watched both seasons several times and laughed everytime.  The outtakes (bloopers due to voice actors messing up) are great as well.

5928431,5,B00ENN8FNE,"This is another show my daughter discovered on YouTube. It may feel a little odd to us as parents to have our kids watch characters that represent concepts from World War II, but it is done very well and in the process, the kids actually can learn a little history without realizing it.",1397692800,,286,4.415094339622642

5928434,3,B00ENN8FNE,I won't be recommending this to anyone since I was unable to finish the first disk.  I thought other people gave it too high a rating.,1395446400,,134,4.153846153846154
5928435,4,B00ENN8FNE,"I wouldn't say Hetalia is the perfect source for history information, but it is certainly very entertaining. I slightly prefer the Axis Powers series but still love the World Series.

The product is in really good condition excluding a little dent in the side, but it's not too noticeable. It came with four DVDs: two discs for two seasons and two for extras. You can watch it in Japanese with English subtitles or in English without subtitles. I have personally fell in love with the Japanese voices, but the English version is a lot more funny.
