7966641,5,B00006AUHP,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this video.  She dances, sings and claps to it.  Even better, I love that Miss Patty Cake has found a balance between fun, education, and lack of annoyance!  Sooo very hard to find.",1120435200,7,205,4.205128205128205
7966642,5,B00006AUHP,"Being an educator who specializes in early childhood development, I would highly recommend ANY of the Miss Patty Cake videos.  Jean Thompson, who plays the Miss Patty Cake character, is the epitome of a perfect preschool teacher.  She is NOT annoying...as some of these other reviews suggest.  She is simply full of love for the Lord and for the children she is teaching!  When my youngest was only 9 months, she was listening to and watching Miss Patty Cake and responding with utter glee to the music and happiness that comes from the shows.  I have given it for gifts for ages 1, 2 and 3 and ALL have loved it!",1098230400,10,613,4.486486486486487
7966643,5,B00006AUHP,"The children in my home are ages 1yr, 20 mo, 2, 3, 4, 6 years old (Oh and one 44yr. old) and they all love this video.  We all sing and dance and learn about God while having a great time. Young children learn best while having fun so loosen up and have some fun with your kids.",1055203200,8,278,3.793103448275862
7966644,5,B00006AUHP,"As I write this my 2 year old (her birthday is today) is eating her birthday pancakes and jamming to Miss Patty Cake!  Her Godparents gave us this video last week and warned us about how obnoxious it might be at first, but once you get past the first viewing, you'll find yourself singing the songs yourself!
""I praise you God with the hands you made"" song is MY favorite.  Buy the tape just for that song alone!
If your child doesn't know his/her animals yet, it's a great teaching tool...and the Bible verse...who could ask for more in a short tape.  We own them all from Elmo to Dora and Spongebob and Baby Einstein...and this by far is the favorite  Christian values and learning all in one tape...wow!
Gotta go...she's asking me to start the tape AGAIN!",1037232000,7,758,4.471014492753623
7966645,5,B00006AUHP,"Ok, I agree with the fellow reviewer that Miss Patty Cake is very annoying, but I find myself humming the songs all day long.  She is a great entertainer for the toddler age-group (1 to 5) and teaches regular stuff like Barney and Elmo (counting, animal sounds, etc) while also teaching about God's love and how He deserves our praise!  This zoo video even has a Bible verse song in it, to help my son (and me!) remember a Bible verse with book, chapter and verse.  I highly recommend this to any Christian parent wanting to instill Christian values in their young ones.",1029196800,8,570,4.514563106796117
