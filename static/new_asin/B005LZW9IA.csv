8478853,1,B005LZW9IA,"David DeCoteau strikes (out) again! I have now seen 4 of the 1313 series and should have had my head examined after the first one for buying it. ""Fool me once, shame on you""; ""Fool me twice, shame on me""; ""Fool me three or more times and I am an ABSOLUTE FOOL!""
This one starts off as have a couple of others I have seen (and probably more) where some young men walk into the ""1313 House"" as it is now called since, apparently, DeCoteau gets a special deal and films all of the series there regardless of locale (the viewer isn't supposed to notice that it's always the same house I guess). They're always dressed in shorts which later becomes underwear and are trying to find someone.  Soon, they are dispatched and never seen again.  How they get into this multi-million dollar home which must never be locked and where they come from is never revealed. In Actor Slash Model, they are all stabbed to death by a disgruntled actor wannabe who is always being rejected because he doesn't have the ""model"" look of the others.  Quite frankly, he doesn't have the acting chops either and the others don't necessarily have the ""model"" look as well. Despite the mounting body count, no one ever comes upon a dead body, with one exception.  And the one individual who does find a corpse lying next to his bed calls his agent rather than calling 911 since he now has a better chance of getting a particular role. Even Jackie Collins didn't stretch things that far in her take on Hollywood.  Of course, the overly ambitious young man also gets stabbed.  Now mind you, we never see a blood splatter pattern anywhere; we never see blood on a floor; in fact, we never see blood at all.  This 1313 House must have some maid even though she is invisible.  Indeed, the 1313 House has no domestic help whatsoever. It must clean itself through a supernatural process.  The house itself looks as though it was put together by Salvador Dali when he was on a severe bender, and the so-called furniture looks like it came from the Salvation Army as well as a used car junk yard.  All of this would make a great parody but I don't believe that DeCoteau intended it to be so.  He likes to brag that he can shoot an entire film in one day - and it shows!  He also likes to brag that there is no nudity which is just as well since the ""eye candy"" concept is highly exaggerated. A couple of the cast members don't even look as though they are 18. When the best one in DeCoteau's films is his old standy Michelle Bauer, you know that you are in trouble. Semi-nude young men wandering aimlessly through a sterile labyrinthine mansion; young men shown showering endlessly with no soap; others swimming a few laps in the 1313 House pool; a plot as thin as a sheet of paper, and an ending that is like something out of the Twilight Zone does not a movie make.  Avoid this one and anything that begins with the numbers 1313.  Remember: You've been warned!",1437436800,,2923,4.418994413407821
8478854,1,B005LZW9IA,"It's really worse than all the other ratings. It's 72 minutes including credits. It's set in the most absurd house I've even seen; that's California for you. I bought the DVD for the boy-toy eye candy as depicted on the cover. The abs must have been airbrushed in. None of the boys have six-pack abs. In fact the bodies are average teenagers' at #6, maybe two rate a 7. When they take their shirts off, disappointment reigns. The two boys that have been injudiciously selected to work out don't even show any muscles when doing so. Logan is a cute young boy; of course, he is not seen much. He may be the worst actor though, not that it matters: . The slasher is not very attractive; so, one can easily understand why he did not get the part. The big question is where did all the corpses go; only one is shown. Everyone wanders around a house full of cadavers and never finds one. Not very creepy.",1416441600,,898,4.351190476190476
8478855,1,B005LZW9IA,"I like watching movies, but I HATE acting and LOATHE coherent plots, so you can imagine that there aren't too many films out there I actually enjoy. Thank goodness for Actor Slash Model!
I mean, just the other day I was complaining that too many films waste time with compelling characters and don't have enough footage of hunky guys walking around aimlessly and maybe working out or something and then getting stabbed off-camera. Well, that was the sickness, and Actor Slash Model is the cure!
This film is perfect for those quiet afternoons when you have literally done everything else there is to do on this planet, nay, this universe. Dear god, I am burning up with fever and the prescription is more Actor Slash Model.",1333929600,11,723,4.746031746031746
8478856,2,B005LZW9IA,"Another entry in cult director David DeCoteau's ""1313"" horror franchise, ""Actor Slash Model"" tells the story of an embittered young actor frustrated by losing all the good roles he thinks he deserves to ""meat puppets"", fellow actors whose only talent is looking good without a shirt.  So he prowls the halls of a Hollywood mansion neatly dispatching his rivals with his trusty carving knife.

The standard DeCoteau touches are here:  a bevy of good-looking, mostly undressed young studs, swim and shower and workout while DeCoteau's camera lovingly explores their bodies.  And we have the usual bad acting and lame dialogue, which usually add to the fun.

But we also have to put up with the director's repetitiveness, which has unfortunately become a hallmark of his work.  We are treated to at least three extended sequences (maybe more) in which one of the actor/models roams the empty house calling, ""Hello?  Is anybody there?"" for several minutes.  And then, after this latest victim is dispatched, (thankfully DeCoteau has the good taste to avoid blood and gore), we get to watch our hero stalking the same halls and rooms repeating the same lines.  It wears thin after awhile.

DeCoteau's movies have always been a guilty pleasure.  You know you shouldn't enjoy them, but they are just too much fun to resist.  Or at least they used to be.  Of late, though, his films are becoming a bit of a bore.  Please, David, give us another ""Leeches"" or ""House of Usher""!",1331337600,8,1467,4.886639676113361
8478857,5,B005LZW9IA,"If I was going to review this film based solely on the DVD Cover or Trailer (Who in their Right Mind would do THAT?!), I would probably have dismissed this one as another Boys-N-Briefs flick with nothing to distinguish it from the others besides the Exceptionally Beautiful Cast.
 However, I Did watch the movie (twice) and I am So Pleased that these 1313 movies are finally trying to be something more than mere Eye Candy by adding actual Characters played by actors that can actually act. Or are they Models that can actually act? Or are they Models that can't really act at all? Or are they all of the above?
 The idea of casting actors for their looks (or Personal Wealth like Paris Hilton or Madonna) as opposed to actual Talent is a common one, and certainly not unfamiliar to Director David DeCoteau, who has found and cast many of todays Rising Stars while at the same time giving Models their first break in films as Actors; so it might come as a bit of a suprise that most of the cast is made up of actual actors.
 Like in 1313:Wicked Stepbrother, Michelle Bauer (Nightmare Sisters) Owns every scene she is in, and has strong support from Chase Bennett and Skyler Hart who are definetly Rising Stars!
 Over the next few months the 1313 Series continues with Boy Crazies, Cougar Cult and Bigfoot Island and I for one can't wait!",1325808000,3,1337,4.535269709543568
