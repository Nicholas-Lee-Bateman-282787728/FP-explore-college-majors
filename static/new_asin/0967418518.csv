172707,5,0967418518,"Words cannot describe what this movie has done to my boys.  I have two, ages 3 & 4.  They just LOVE this movie.  This is not just a Christmas video.  It's good all year round.  I had rented the movie first and they watched every day, 2 and 3 times a day.  It has a really cute story and will hold anyone's attention for quite sometime.  My husband and I really enjoyed it too.  My youngest loved it so much he wants a cow so he can named it Annabelle.",974073600,5,451,3.933333333333333
172708,5,0967418518,"I have owned this movie for five years.  I have watched it with my Grandchildren many times.  I am purchasing more so they can all have a copy to take it home with them.  The music is beautiful and the story is very tender and new.  We all love it.
It is a wonderful movie for all ages.",974073600,,286,3.8793103448275863
172709,5,0967418518,"This is such a touching story. Anyone of any age will enjoy this story from start to finish. Annabelle, Billy, Grampa and Emily are wonderful characters that teach what friendship and giving are all about.  We're buying this for several people on our shopping list this year!",973987200,,275,4.851063829787234
172710,5,0967418518,"A friend of mine introduced me to this movie and I'm glad she did. I'm not the kind of person who normally watches sappy movies when anyone has a chance of seeing me watch them. I am, however, a closet romantic and I must say I happily watched ANNABELLE'S WISH and unashamedly sniffled with tears in my eyes towards the end.
I think this movie ranks up with some of my all time holiday favorites like ""The Year Without a Santa Clause,"" ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,"" and ""Small One"". In terms of length, it's a little short, certainly designed so for the younger audiences it will attract, but it's the kind of movie you'll pull out of the cabinet time and again during the holiday season simply because it will make you feel good to watch it. Cocoa or warm cider, a blanket, and a few children watching will make your viewing time that much better.",970012800,5,852,4.43312101910828
172711,5,0967418518,I am a die hard fan of the Christmas classics that I grew up with.  I was reluctant to watch any new specials but Annabell's wish is an exceptional and heartwarming special that had me tears. Before Annabell's wish the only  special I cried at was Nestor the long eared donkey!,913420800,,277,4.411764705882353
172712,5,0967418518,"Truly the best Christmas story ever told! I'm a 32 year old father of 3 and I cry ever time I watch it. Up to this point I have enjoyed a large number of the standard Christmas favorites (Rudolph, Frosty, Grinch etc.)  with my children, and nothing comes close to this in offering the real  feeling of Christmas. I dare anyone to watch this animated classic and not  feel wholesome and refreshed when it is through. This is my new all time  favoite Christmas video.",911952000,,465,4.435294117647059
172713,5,0967418518,"What inspired me initially to buy the video of...Annabelle's wish was the fac it was narrated by my...favorite country artist, randy Travis.  I was...really not sure how much I would get out of it...because I just happen to be totally blind and not...sure how much visual would be required to truly...enjoy it.
...Not only was it easy to follow even for some-...one with out sight but I loved the story as I felt...It uplifts the spirit giving hope that miracles...really can happen and reams really do come true....
Too, I felt the acters did a tremendously...great job...in representing the characters each portrayed....Not only would I recommend it to others, I have.  END",881107200,8,675,5.017857142857143

I was worried about buying it because it said it was a region 4 dvd that doesn't work with U.S. dvd players.  Well my Sony dvd player that is about 2 years old played it with no problems.  I also read that region 4 dvds will play on computers if for some reason it doesn't work with your dvd player( I have not tried this option out yet).  I am very happy that it actually played on the dvd player because my son LOVED the movie and I'm sure we will be watching it several more times before Christmas, and for many more years to come.",1513468800,2,628,4.122950819672131

172747,5,0967418518,"We stumbled across this movie in a rental store not long after it came out and it became a Christmas tradition to go rent Annabelles Wish every year. When the rental store closed, my parents rushed to the store to purchase it but it was already sold. So we went the next 10 years without it until I got married and wanted it for my kids someday. I was just giddy when I found it on Amazon and watched it as soon as it came in. Oh man. I thought it was sweet and happy when I was a kid. I bawled like a baby as an adult. This movie shows what true love, friendship, and sacrifice means. They just don't make movies like this anymore. This is hands down my favorite Christmas movie. I cannot wait to share this with my kids someday.",1510531200,,730,4.076388888888889

172751,5,0967418518,"Loved the movie (vhs form) when I was a child, and for Christmas one year we got a basset hound and named her Annabelle. This year in may, I ordered this movie here because I thought it would be symbolic to watch it with her one last time. We determined that she wasn't doing well and we were going to have to euthanize her. The movie came in way ahead of schedule, 2 days before we said goodbye to her. We got to watch it with her one last time. I don't know if it was just good luck, or excellent ship time on the companies part, but definite recommendation. For the company and the movie.",1505433600,,591,4.103448275862069

172763,3,0967418518,"I won't say Annabelle's Wish is an amazing movie. It's not. But it is cute and harmless and in a sea of Christmas specials, I was surprised at just how sweet and well produced it actually was.

I watched this with my wife, as it was one of her favorite Christmas specials growing up. It revolves around the titular Annabelle, a young calf who befriends a little boy who is mute, due to an accident that occurred that took both his parents. I won't go into further details, because doing so would pretty much spoil the movie, but there's a very cute story about sacrifice, love and friendship. There's also some surprisingly great voice talent, and while Randy Travis isn't a stellar voice over actor, he does have a folksy charm that is great for the narration.

That being said, this is far from perfect. The animation, while certainly not bad and certainly serviceable, isn't the highest quality. Especially if you're going to stack it up to other animated Christmas shorts (Ziggy's Gift came out a good twenty years or so earlier and looks way better). There's a song in the middle of the story that felt unnecessary and tacked on, and when I viewed the short with my wife and my parents later that same year, I could tell they were no where near as engaged.

So, in short, is this worth the money? Sure. It's cute and sweet and clearly aimed at a younger audience, who will probably get a lot out of it. It has a great message too. But in terms of a Christmas classic the whole family can enjoy? Well, that's a bit of a stretch.

As a side note, this is JUST the movie. Understandably, this movie does not contain any additional features. It doesn't even have a menu. It's really not an issue, but I figured it might be worth mentioning.",1490745600,,1741,4.465408805031447

173118,4,0967418518,"however IMHO after a few viewings over the years, I sometimes wonder if the story would have been better if Annabelle had remained a cow; after all, she did sacrifice her wish of becoming a reindeer to give Billy a voice.
Besides, can you just imagine the dialogue between Billy and Emily?
Emily: ""Did you find Annabelle? Is she okay?""
Billy: ""She's fine, honey. Santa Claus turned her into a reindeer.""
Uhh--Ye--eah.
I think a better ending would have been: Billy is waiting up with the critters when Santa comes by to give them their speech. This year there is a new tenant in the barn: A calf, Annabelle's daughter, born the day before. When she asks, ""Wh--Why can't Maa-maa ta-alk?"", Billy gently scratches the back of her neck and replies, ""Well, darling, I've got a story to tell you all...""  Then the end credits roll.

173214,4,0967418518,"Every Christmas Eve,Santa Claus brings the animals a very special gift, the ability to speak!  It is only their secret,and no one else's. Billy, a young boy living on the farm, lost his voice in a fire, befriends Annabelle.  Annabelle has a very special wish for Billy, her first intention was to fly Santa's sleigh, but her new wish is very special...she gives her voice to Billy! Many years later,she is rewarded by receiving her first wish, becoming a reindeer! She speaks again,and makes everyone's dreams come true.

This really is a nice holiday special, especially for the younger kids in the family.  It's replete with the mean neighbors who want to take Annabelle after Billy damages their fence and his Grandpa doesn't have the money to pay and fix it.

Voices are provided by Jerry Van DYke, Cloris Leachman, Jim varney, and Randy Travis as the narrator.  Very nice!",1102982400,,877,4.8133333333333335
173215,5,0967418518,"Annabelle is a calf who was given as a Christmas present to Billy, who suffers from anxiety-induced mutism.  Annabelle's single dream is to be one of Santa's reindeer. Santa Claus gives animals the ability to talk each Christmas Day but Annabelle ends up working some magic to fulfill her best friend Billy's wish instead of her own, out of her pure love for the boy.

A side plot is the fight for guardianship between Billy's good, grandpa and the evil, wealthy Aunt Agnes.  In the meantime, Billy is fending off two boys who constantly bully him.

Thanks to Billy's two friends, Annabelle and a neighbor girl, who would do anything for Billy he is able to overcome his disability (with Santa's help) and endure the hardships of his life.

My son was non-verbal until he was almost 3 1/2 years old.  Now at age 6 years (and speaking fine!) he begs to watch this Christmas classic about a boy who is ridiculed for his anxiety-induced inability to talk.  This is a great movie about hope and frienships for children with disabilites, especailly those with speech-language deficits or anxiety disorders.

This is also a great resource to teach tolerance to typically developing children.

A sure tear-jerker!",1102118400,3,1206,4.84390243902439
173216,5,0967418518,"The story starts off on Christmas Eve where the legend began. Santa Claus gives the animals of the barn voices for twenty four hours. Annabelle arrives this first night as shown on the video. Santa leaves a note for Billy that the calf is his Christmas present.

Billy has been unable to talk since the fire in the barn that left him in the care of his grandfather. His Aunt is the sister to his father, from what I can tell. It is love at first sight for Annabelle and Billy and off they go to play in the snow. Agnes brings Charles, the grandfather imported bon bon's from Paris for his present. Agnes and Charles go into the barn to see what Billy got from Santa Claus.

The funniest part of the movie is when Agnes steps in ""kaka"" and the way she says it is hysterical. They proceed back to the house and Billy is left alone in the barn. Well this is the first time Billy has wanted to stay in the barn since the tragic fire. His Aunt Agnes prefers to call him William and the clothes she wears are bright orange and go with her hair.

Annabelle makes the mistake of talking in front of Billy and the animals decide it is okay for only Billy to know about the secret that comes once a year from Santa Claus. Annabelle decides she wants to be a reindeer and be with Santa Claus. She tells Billy her dream.

There is a song by Randy Travis about changing seasons and making friends. Tears come to my eyes everytime I see the scenes with the song that show Billy, Annabelle and Emily, while Randy sings about seasons come and seasons go.

There are many lessons in this fine movie. The two neighbor boys apologize for making up stories. Gus meets Agnes and they seem made for each other. Grandpa gets his music box back, the animals get their yearly treat.

The animation and music are such added bonuses as well as the voices that I do not get to hear on sitcoms anymore. The most important thing to remember is to keep this movie in an active collection and not to be utilized only for the holiday season.",1098230400,20,2008,4.271052631578947
173217,5,0967418518,"Annabelle's Wish is one of the best non-commerical and non-religious Christmas stories ever told.  The ending can bring a tear to most eyes.  Although it is a straight-to-video cartoon, the cast is full of big names like Jerry Van Dyke, the late Jim Varney, Frank Welker, Cloris Leachman, and Randy Travis (who also sings a few songs).
Annabelle is a calf born on Grandpa Baker's farm on Christmas Eve who wants to become one of Santa's reindeer.  Struggling for money, Grandpa gives Annabelle as a Christmas gift to Billy, his orphaned grandson who lives with him.  We learn that Santa Claus gives the animals the gift of speech each Christmas Day and that Billy has been mute since being caught in a barn fire when he was younger.
During the coming year Grandpa Baker tries to keep guardianship of Billy from a rich and tenacious Aunt Agnes while Billy is tormented by the bullying Holder Boys.  Luckily Billy has his two best friends Annabelle and neighbor Emily to help him though it all.
Does Billy stay with his poor Grandpa on the farm or go to the city with his rich aunt?  Will he ever talk again?  Does Annabelle ever pull Santa's sleigh?  Will the Holder Boys ever get what's coming to them?
I won't tell you, you have to watch the movie.  It's worth it!",1041811200,13,1265,4.561946902654867
173218,5,0967418518,"This is just the best ""cartoon"" Christmas movie ever.  And what a great message it gives us through Annabelle the cow. Annabelle teaches us by example that it is better to give than to receive. Her best friend is a little boy who is now mute because of his fear in a barn fire some time in the past.  The boy has few friends, but the animals and a little girl who befriend him are true-blue.  The boy is given his voice in the end from Santa because Annabelle gave up her wish to fly like the reindeer.  It really is touching.  You've got to get this one for the kids (and adults who are soft at heart).",1039996800,,603,4.076271186440678
173219,5,0967418518,"Well,  alot of the newer Christmas specials don't have the same kind of magic that the older classics had.  This is a wonderful exception. Its charming and sentimental, and full of magic. With a down home ""country"" feel, this special shows that christmas is about love and giving.  When Annabelle is born on Christmas Eve, Santa comes and gives all the barn animals a special gift,  they can talk on Christmas Day! Annabelle decides that if she is really good all year long, maybe Santa will grant her a special wish so she can fly with his reindeer!  But when Billy needs her,  does that mean she won't get her chance?  There's a star-studded cast of voice, and the DVD contains lots of great extras (including a deleted song, a funny one which the kids might enjoy!) This movie is a total tear-jerker and great for adults and children too.  Definately make this a special you watch!",1037059200,40,884,4.585987261146497
