8135250,5,B000GYI3JA,"In the 1950s, CBS broadcasted a television show called You are There, hosted by Walter Cronkite. The concept was that Cronkite would take CBS reporters back in time to cover great historical events such as, for example, the assassination of Julius Caesar. The program would cover the event as if it were a current news story, interviewing the main characters just as one would cover any news story.

Peter Watkins took this concept and applied it to the events leading up to, during and culminating to the conclusion of the Paris Commune. Through the skillful use of mostly non-professional actors, cue cards giving the basic events of the Commune, and the faux on-the-scene reporting, you, the viewer, feel that You are There. Really.

The production notes for this DVD remark that this feature is in the form of a documentary.
This description does little justice to this marvelous feature. You may think, relying simply on this product description that a docu-drama with nonprofessional actors, that it would be boring or tedious, especially when it is over five hours long.

Wrong. Not true. This movie is an incredibly intense, entertaining, fast-paced, and an historically accurate account of the spontaneous rebellion which occurred in Paris, France, in 1871. Trust me, you will be glued to the screen for the length of the movie.

Director Peter Watkins takes you in the middle of the action by employing the features of modern news reporting with which we are all too familiar. There is a News Anchor, two reporters, and talking heads. There are also the participants of the events of the Paris Commune.

The two reporters, looking directly to the camera, begin the movie to introduce the viewer to what is about to happen. They are dressed in eighteenth century garb, microphones in hand, and cover the Paris Commune as any modern newsperson. That they are holding microphones looks completely natural and not inconsistent with common sense; it demonstrates the extent to which we are so completely conditioned by the media. The reporters interview the protesters, generals, military rank-and-file soldiers, politicians, ordinary citizens    anyone who had anything to do with the revolt. The action on the street frequently breaks to a dour-looking News Anchor giving the newest developments on the protests or of the on-going war with Germany, and conducting his own interviews on these developments with experts and politicians and other talking heads. Just like Fox News, only without the vitriol and with no commercials.

...  But wait, theres new developments on the streets of Paris. Lets see whats happening down there, Chet. ...  Coverage will break to more interviews of participants on the streets of Paris, with beating drums and choruses of La Marseillaise in the background. Then, coverage will break with coverage of the general assemblies and other interviews on the street. The reporters will interview the average man on the street, the defecting members of the National Guard, the working women of Paris who spearheaded the revolt, and others. When the reporters are finished interviewing, the camera will occasionally pan to a group of people intently watching the full coverage of the events on a television.

La Commune appears to be shot with a combination of regular film and video tape. The stationary scenes of News Anchor are on film, but whenever action breaks to the streets, all coverage is from hand-held, video tape cameras.

Watkins use of nonprofessional actors was wise. It would have been a mistake to have, say, Gerard Depardieu or Marion Cotillard, among the cast. Instead, having the participants in the streets look just like you and me, ordinary people fed up with the present state, makes the film all more compelling.

Its easy to get wrapped up with all the action. Yes, this could have been how events unfolded on the streets of Paris in 1871, and possibly also Paris in 1968. La Commune, however, captures all the energy, the action, the swift movement of events, and that empowering feeling that change is possible, possessed of any popular movement, and certainly has the elements which were present in the Occupy Movement and protests, at least the ones in which this reviewer participated.

There was a reason why Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie a 100% rating.",1437955200,,4320,5.0647887323943666
8135251,4,B000GYI3JA,"The film is a 5 star item, what happened for me, and I hope it didn't happen for anyone else purchasing it was that the film on the 2nd disc was defective, wouldn't play anymore at a certain point. The third disc containing the documentary wouldn't even get to the menu page. This doesn't happen with any of my other 2,000 or so dvd's. Not sure if I want to buy it again from this dvd label, would feel more comfortable purchasing the European version.",1428278400,,452,4.329411764705882
8135252,3,B000GYI3JA,"The concept and the subject matter... the stuff that makes glorious things possible! However, from the possible to a disaster it didn't take long for ruin to show its face. This is a painful  thing to watch, something  that you feel are required to witness, but can't watch although you feel you should. This project needed a talented editor, if so it could have been so much better. Rent it, I showed my enthusiasm by purchasing, and now, it collects dust on my library. Having said that, taste is a choice, and the momentous historical events should be examined, even if only in film, to understand the fiery delight of humans in destroying that which represents inequity.",1356480000,,674,4.752136752136752

8135256,4,B000GYI3JA,"La Commune was the final picture from fillmaker Peter Watkins. With a small film crew and a cast of amatuers, Watkins recreates the Paris Commune.  During this epic, we witness the rise and eventual fall of the commune.
What prevents this movie from being a 5 star film was the lack of a tighter version of the film.  The behind-the-scenes looks at the making of film were of some interest, it took away from the deep dramatic aspects of the film.  Still an entetaining picture none the less.",1186272000,2,492,4.568181818181818

8135258,3,B000GYI3JA,"Fans of Peter Watkin's earlier films, especially his brilliantly directed THE WAR GAME, and the cleverly recreated

faux documentaries, PUNISHMENT PARK and CULLODEN need to pull in their expectations when approaching LA COMMUNE.  A lot of time has passed since those earlier triumphs, and there is very little ""riveting re-creations of dramatic events to be had""---everyone TALKS about dramatic events, have just participated in them, or are going to --but the recreations take place in a large warehouse-factory,and are nothing like the

exciting moments in the earlier films. And there is an awfully lot of talking and polemic--socialist mindset--that, well, educates.  Many of the scenes reminds one of a college seminar with students dressed in costumes airing the issues of the times--and if that sounds exciting to you, this is your baby. For my part, I longed that some of the characters, desperaton and tragic consequences of that brief revolution would be up there on the screen (the rows of coffins famous in photographs, with poetic young intellectuals placed in them comes to mind)...but this is the least ""visual"" of Watkins films.  And there is also lots of filler (no drama, no debate, just meandering around with the camera) which doesn't help move the ideas foward very fast.  For excitement, try THE WAR GAME.  For visual beauty go to EDVARD MUNCH.  But if motley revolutionists expounding endlessly for a doomed cause with a few bursts of passion and exalted oratory are what you crave, get ready to be patient and by all means, embrace LA COMMUNE.",1172102400,17,1567,5.09375
