2137180,5,B0002XQWB6,"I absolutely LOVED this movie!!  I truly fell in love with Tom Sullivan, as played by Marc Singer.  The man was fearless and willing to try anything, and I don't believe he regarded his blindness as a handicap.  A fun and joyous romp.  I just wish they'd release it on DVD!",1219276800,11,273,4.294117647058823
2137181,5,B0002XQWB6,"Oh my gosh, I absolutely loved this movie, and I have no idea why it just entered my head after all these years. I had to be about 16 when this movie was out, and I remember me and my dad just cracking up during the whole thing. I truly wish someone would take this fantastic movie and put it on DVD. I wish they made movies like this today. My kids have no idea what a good movie is these days. I vote this as my number one movie of all times!",1198886400,25,444,3.78494623655914
2137182,5,B0002XQWB6,"In the best performance of his career, Marc Singer conveys a blind Tom Sullivan ""seeing"" the joys in the world around him and wringing the most enjoyment out of each and every one. His friends share in his antics and you sense a richness in their relationships that trandsends handicap. Skydiving, drinking, driving, meeting women, golfing, college blackouts and working in a pub are all approached with the same zest and joyous attitude. If you're looking for something different, this is it.",1150588800,19,493,5.024390243902439
2137183,5,B0002XQWB6,The Pool scene in the movie actually happened in real life only the little girl was his own daughter.  The one liners and upbeat humor in this movie make it a great repeat movie to watch. There are many places I love but my favorite has to be when pulled over by the cop the blind guy is driving because he was the only one sober enough..... Wish they would put it on DVD my VHS tape is about worn out...,1135555200,20,404,3.9876543209876543

2137211,5,B0002XQWB6,"I got the shipment in the time frame given. I would have liked it on dvd. I had to
get the movie on a used vhs tape. I was very happy with quality and condition of the
tape.  The movie brings back of how as grown ups we still tend to break rules because we don't think they matter or we that we would get caught. In everyone's life time we realize life can change in moment and we pray that it all comes out well. I want to thank the supplier and amazon for being able to get this movie for me.",1316563200,2,494,3.796116504854369
2137212,3,B0002XQWB6,"I read the book years ago and later saw the movie too. The thing that pleasantly surprised me when I saw the movie was how funny it was. I wasn't surprised it had the warmth that it had. But it also was entertaining and fun to watch.

However, the book also documented that when Sullivan met his wife, he was wild and rambunctious. But she was a good Catholic girl.  The book documented with some depth that Sullivan had something of a religious awakening. I was mildly disappointed though that the movie didn't deal with that in much depth. Typical. With few exceptions, Hollywood writers and directors generally don't understand religion and would rather avoid it, at least with regard to Christian religion.

I call it a good movie, but not a great movie. It's entertaining, it's funny, and it has some warmth. There are some good moments. But the characters are a bit on the flat side. Some of it is predictably saccharine. It doesn't really capture the complexity of the main character as he was portrayed in the book. But it's a worth a viewing if you can find an old VHS copy.",1296086400,,1083,4.543589743589743

8034286,3,B0002XQWB6,I really loved this movie but I just wish they could have cut down on a lot of the swearing that's all...but other then that it's a beautiful and fun movie that's why I'm giving it 3 star's instead of 5 because it's really not necessary...so if you guy's have anything to say about that fine but just remember I am entitled to my own opinion,1492646400,,341,4.181818181818182

8034290,2,B0002XQWB6,"I knew the story of the real Tom Sullivan, and I was excited to find a reasonably priced copy of this on an auction site.  I'd also read the write-ups and was expecting a funny, kind-of inspirational, wholesome movie. Not. PG rating?  Really? Language and sexual innuendos (for a very mild example, Tom comments on a girlfriend's soft nipples, and judges her to be about a B-cup) would make this a minimum of a PG-13, if not a soft R movie. I certainly wouldn't let any kid of mine sit and watch this. Tom Sullivan was a handsome but otherwise unremarkable 20-something, preoccupied with partying, girls and sex--the stereotypical college kid, bedding first one chick and then another. At one point, he almost lost the girl he ended up marrying because she called him when he was in bed with another girl! Yes, he was blind and didn't let that stop him and went on to become an accomplished musician, but is that so remarkable in and of itself? (I worked for a blind professor who was far more inspirational--and funny!) I found the whole premise a bit insulting to the visually impaired; it gave the impression that being blind and a normal person was somehow a phenomenal accomplishment worthy of note, when there are many blind professionals who view their handicap as a detour, not a road block, and leave a monumental mark on society--and a legacy of virtue.",1445558400,,1363,4.675
8034291,2,B0002XQWB6,the item looked like it was copied off the television and if was not very clear. There were also many portions of the movie missing.,1439769600,5,132,4.32
8034292,4,B0002XQWB6,"Heavy cussing/raunchy. Know this upfront. However; the real Tom Sullivan can be heard singing ""You're The One"" with Helen Reddy, and they are fantastic!",1422144000,,152,5.375
