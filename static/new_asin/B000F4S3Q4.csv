8117558,5,B000F4S3Q4,"I have many of the older TaeBo dvds and recently came across this one-I don't know how I missed it when it first came out! It has less punches then in Billy's other dvds-it's more calisthenics,such as pushups,jogging in place,squat thrusts,etc. I really don't care for a lot of the newer dvds that Billy has put out,only because they seem to be the same old moves,but with a new cast. This has become my new favorite dvd,along with Bootcamp 1,Ultimate Bootcamp and Get Ripped Advanced 1. The only newer dvds by Billy that I enjoy are CardioSculpt,since it's my first TaeBo with weights and TaeBo Express,because I can do 1 or 2 segments at the end of the day and sweat buckets. If you enjoy TaeBo,you must get this one-the first time I did it I was just so excited to use it again-its so rare to feel that way with a lot of my other hardcore dvds! I've wasted so much money on a lot of the newer dvds out now(Tapout,T-25,Jillian's Body Revolution)and I always seem to come back to TaeBo-my oldies but goodies!!",1393372800,2,1010,4.464864864864865
