1959628,3,B0000YTPO8,"This movie isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be and the cast isn't completley unknown. Marni is played by Bethany Joy Lenz from One Tree Hill, Derek the D.J is played by Richard Jackson from Saved By The Bell The New Class, Greg is played by Bryce Johnson from Popular.
 Anyway, it's a straight to video movie ofcourse you can't sit down and watch it expecting it to be some amazing piece of cinematic work. The lead actress was fat and they should've casted someone else as it was very annoying to see her prancing around her flab in her undies though and her acting wasn't great. But one thing is a fact, the cheerleading choreography was better than in the first movie. The music wasn't good however but damn the moves were fantastic, especially the Renegades at the end, it's the one part that I've watched a bunch of times when I rented it.
All in all it was a decent straight to video movie. The price however is too much for it.
 It's watchable.
Ofcourse, I would've loved to see a sequel with the original cast instead but it's all done.
What about a third one with the originals? Atleast some of them at college. Bring It On Once Again?....lol",1074470400,,1163,4.37962962962963

1959630,3,B0000YTPO8,"Whoever gave the green light to this production did so with the least possible effort.  Corners were cut and the result is a waste of enthusiasm. Peyton Reed's bright original ""Bring It On"" shares only costumes and theme with this disastrous sequel that raises the stakes on suspension of disbelief and comes out a big loser.
The story is still centered around a peppy blonde who cheers her heart out, but this time it's a cast of unknowns and a story that never flies higher than a belly ring.  It's just too implausable that two girls can attempt to convert a squad of spirit misfits into college national competition-level cheerleaders in three days, or that a woeful goth ballerina would pull a herkie. Renegade college cheerleaders? A high school setting focusing on the competition between school and elite squads would have been much more satisfying.
There are some redeeming moments, with wacky physical comedy and lots of cheering action, which is what diehard ""Bring It On"" fans expect, along with a now-classic war of the words between rivals.  It's impossible to criticize the scenes where this upstart squad does exactly what cheerleaders are supposed to do: cheer their team to victory, and we're talking low-glam sports that are ignored by most schools. The rest of the film just didn't deliver, no matter how much I wanted it to.
Three stars only because I felt the cast put their heart into their work.  Too bad the industry bean counters pawned theirs.",1074038400,,1470,4.868

I won't talk about the bad acting because, lets be honest, the acting in the first one wasn't that great.  So lets get right to the reason we watch the movie at all... the cheerleading.

1959651,4,B0000YTPO8,"Bring It On Again is one of those films that is better understood, once in the future looking back.

After the first Bring It On movie came out, this one followed and didn't stand up to some people's expectations . I think the main reason for that, was they wanted another High School themed Bring It On  with the same main characters. But that wasn't the case here. Instead we had Whittier and Monica as the two leads, as they try their hand at joining  the cheer squad on a college campus.

But with the over confident Tina ruling the roost, joining the team was easier said than done. Her sidekick, Marnie,  complicated matters, because she was on tap to be the next lead cheerleader, once Tina graduated. However, the school Dean puts his eye on Whittier as being the girl who could carry the team forward. So he asks Tina to groom Whittier into that position.

There's a lot of rivalry between the girls, until Monica and Whittier quit the squad.  It forces them into forming their own squad called the Renegades, which directly challenges Tina's squad. One thing leads to another, until a showdown occurs, where the school has to vote on who will represent them at the Nationals. After that showdown, the film ends.

Now that I gave a partial summary, I'll tell you why this film works better than most people give it credit for. For one, it doesn't try to redo the High School drama that all the other Bring It On films are based on. It goes to a college setting and dares to do something different.

Second, Tina is probably one of the best stuck up Cheer Leader villains in the whole series. She looks the part, and she handles the role and dialogue brilliantly. Marnie, her over- reactive sidekick, also does a good job. She typically loses her temper, which shows why she may not be the best pick for the Head Cheerleader once Tina is gone. Tina, on the other hand,  is smooth and cool. It helps lend credibility and explains  why Tina has to replace herself with a calmer head like Whittier.

Third, all the silly additions of the dance club, drama club, and martial arts club joining the Renegades, to get money for their programs, works well. This really is a story of misfits coming together for a greater cause. None of the other Bring It On Films were able to pull that idea off with the same finesse.

Fourth , the idea of having to find practice opportunities around the school, at traditionally non cheering events, is hysterical. None of the other films had any ideas even close to that. But again, Bring It On Again dares to do something different. It thinks outside the box.

Fifth, having to work against the Dean of the school, because he already has a pre-chosen favorite squad on campus, adds a lot of stress to the Renegades position. It helps add credibility to their already, underdog status.

To be fair, one issue the film could have improved upon, was actually going to the Nationals, after the team was picked by the school. That would have made more sense, but would also have made the film too long. The story decided to invest it's time in the local conflict, rather than the universal one. I understand that choice, considering the overall plot and time constraints, so I don't fault it for that.

The other area that makes this film different, is Tina and Marnie  are actually the better of the four characters to watch on screen. Yes they were the villains. But they were interesting and  knew how to be the kind of girls you love to hate. Whittier and Monica, on the other hand, were just so, so.  They did fine, but didn't have the same appeal as some  of the other girls did in other Bring It On Movies. Tina and Marnie were just able to upstage them as far as the entertainment factor goes.

So in the end, I'm giving this film a four. It dared to be different and as a result, it was able to do a lot more with the plot. It had great villains and a great showdown scene at the end.  It  was also funny. Overall, plot-wise, it was one of the strongest Bring It on Films in my opinion. If I had to rank them all, my list might look something like this. Best to worst.

1. Bring it On
2. Bring it On All or Nothing
3. Bring it On Again
4. Bring in On Fight to the Finish
5. Bring it On In it to Win It

But I think Again and Nothing could easily hold second place together. They both included  ideas that the last two films simply gave up on. The last two mostly rehash the race, vs class, vs getting a boyfriend scenario.

That's my take on this great, yet often overlooked film, in the Bring It On Series. It's worth a watch and deserves better consideration than some are willing to give it. So make sure if you want to Bring It On, to Bring It On Again!",1421625600,,4699,4.365097588978186

1959702,1,B0000YTPO8,"It's hard to believe that any movie industry professionals were actually associated with straight-to-video production ""Bring It On Again"" (2004). Although a sequel, it is more like a really painful blend of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Cadet Kelly"".

Despite the warnings I actually watched my soon to be re-gifted DVD. Anne Judson-Yager (who looks like Reese Witherspoon plus 30 pounds) plays new college freshman and aspiring cheerleader Whittier Smith. She and her friend Monica (Faune A. Chambers) pass the audition and come under the scrutiny of sadistic head cheerleader Tina Hammersmith (Bree Turner). They soon tire of life under Tina and form a rival cheerleading squad of fine arts students and campus radicals. Despite a host of available movie stereotypes the screenwriter can't seem to figure out how to portray this crowd and you actually feel embarrassed for the actors who must deal with these portions of her script. Production design, style, and unity are apparently unknown elements to director Damon Santostefano (unsuccessfully seeking work since making this movie) and the whole thing seems randomly thrown together. It must have been an assembly nightmare for the editor, who may or may not share some of the blame-it's hard to tell.

I'm at somewhat of a loss as to the target demographic for ""Bring It On Again"". These things tend to be pitched to producers for their sexploitation potential. And in this case they could at least count on a pre-sold sexploitation audience of original ""Bring It On"" fans. But the only tie with the original is the subject of cheerleading and those looking for sexploitation elements will be disappointed.

My guess is that the target audience is actually preteen girls. The script is certainly on that age and sophistication level. The male members of the cast appear to have been selected for their looks (certainly not their acting skills) while the female members are a dreary looking bunch (although their limited acting skills are well-matched with those of the male cast). When your leading lady looks like Judson-Yager and your only really pretty actress is cast as the cheer squad's towel girl; alarm bells should start sounding for those outside this target demographic. I bet the producers wish that they had heard those bells and monitored this project a little closer.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1165622400,3,2384,5.073979591836735

1959714,1,B0000YTPO8,"Bring it on Again, was a terrible movie. With a title so closely related to another movie called, Bring It On, the movie gave off a false representation. It was misguiding and left you believing that it would take off where the last one left off. It also gives the sense that it was a low budget movie just trying to feed off the hype from the original. Although, with its lack of excitement and catchy tunes, that Bring It On had, it couldn't follow in its ""big sister's"" shoes.

 Bring It On Again was also lacking in its confusing storyline and its unknown actors. The movie jumps around from one point of time to another, leaving a disappointment when it randomly ends. However, they got it right when Bring It On was filmed. The movie flowed just right and made it fun to watch. With Kristen Dunst, Gabrielle Union, and Eliza Dushku playing the perky cheerleader roles, it all fit perfectly.

 This movie also needed more involvement with the audience. There was no exciting music or catchy cheers that everyone would find themselves repeating just hours later.  The original movie had girls all over singing their cheers including: "" I'm Sexy I'm Cute I'm Popular To Boot,"" and ""Burr It's Cold In Here."" Which kept the audience up and moving.

There also wasn't as many exciting cheers and competitions throughout this movie like the first one. For instance; Bring It On, involved regional and national competitions, while Bring It On Again only consisted of a cheer-off between two teams within the college. What would any cheerleading movie be without any competitions?

 Bring It On Again, was not at all what it was made up to be. It was slow and boring at times, and just couldn't keep up with the original. Which is why this film should go in the hall of shame.",1131235200,6,1773,4.624203821656051

While I am a fan of the first movie(I saw it twice in theaters and own the DVD) I hate this sequeal. It dosn't have any of the characters that you fell in love with in the first and you have little to no background on the new main character Whitter.

It takes place when Whitter goes to Cal State College she wants to join the well known and 9-nine year running champs on the cheerleading team under the guidance of cheer goddess Tina. Well, she trys out gets accepted and has potential to be next years team captain. Only a couple of problems Cheer Captain Tina says Whitter must give up her D.J boyfriend, her cheer buddy, and change her personality in order to achieve this. After a little cat fight Whitter decides to quit the squad and start her own gathering a bunch of rejects that are upset about the recent removal of the extra-curicular dance team and musical theater geeks. That's when a cheer war begins to decide which team should go to represent the college at nationals.

This movie has no spunk, spirit, and charm that ""Bring It On"" had. With no star cast and amatuer actors this movie is a real bore. While there are some impressive cheer moves you see little to no actual cheerleading in the movie- except at the cheer battle. The story is all to predictable and will be a disappointment to the fans of ""Bring It On."" This is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile... and one of the rare movies I'd only give one star too.

All said, it did not match up to Bring it on, which had substance. And wth was up with Whittiers bf? They could've chosen a way better-looking guy! Ugh!",1097107200,2,524,4.822222222222222
1959732,2,B0000YTPO8,"To be fair, the sequel to 'Bring it on' is not as bad as you think.  As far as cheerleading contest sequence goes, the cast and crew did homework, even though the fresh surpise of watching the final showdown of the original is missing.  But I think the number of the flooding negative reviews should be justified after all, for 'Bring it on Again' falls short of almost everything that the original had.

So what is wrong with the film?  See, for starters, it has no joyful musical sequence that started the original, with 'I'm Sexy, I'm Cute, and Popular to Boot.'  Instead, you see the unfuny and misguided opening, in which Whittier the heroine of the fim tormented by ... er ... yellow custard or something thrown into the face.  Now, that is a bad sign.

The story is set in Cal State Col, which is not a bad idea.  This time, Tina, the popular leader of cheerleading squad turns out a mean villain, who demands that Whittier should desert her best friend and her possible boyfriend, too.  Then Whittier enlists the help of 'loser' on the campus (like modern dancer wannabes), to make another team, which leads to the final competition.

All right.  The rather familiar portraits of college life can be forgiven, because what we want is lively and likable characters we can relate to.  Unfortunately, the film misses every chance to make them so, or to be funny itself, mainly because of the banal direction that lacks the confidence of 'Bring it on.'  In fact, original 'Bring it on' unashamedly took advantage of the young and sexy images of the girls, as is seen most notably in 'Car Wash' scenes.  This kind of vivacious and audacious energy is not to be found here.

And the original had a great cast including Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, and Gabrielle Union.  With the unknown, but still not-so-bad cast (who did really a good job), the sequel could be better, but not with this timid attitudes.",1092960000,2,1907,4.630952380952381
1959733,3,B0000YTPO8,I thought this was going to suck but it was fairly good. It had it's funny moments and it stood on its own without trying to imitate or try to have the same plot as the original. It was a watchable B movie and I'd recomend it.,1079654400,,226,3.8297872340425534
1959734,3,B0000YTPO8,"If this movie didn't try to have a plot, it would be great.  The scenes where there is no cheerleading action are just kind of painful to watch.  Not much of what happens is plausible, and what is plausible is entirely too predictable. The cheerleading routines are fun to watch thought they're not as good as in the first movie, and the ending stinks.  Even so, I liked the movie and will watch it again.",1075248000,,405,4.373333333333333
1959735,4,B0000YTPO8,"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love the original Bring It On and have seen it so many times that I can recite the entire script along with the actors.  Seeing as how I enjoyed the first film so much, I expected this to be nowhere near as much fun.  I was wrong.
Bring It On Again (the title alone screams ""direct-to-video B-movie sequel"") is delightfully campy fun.  The story isn't a direct rip-off of the original, like many DTV sequels are (see: Cruel Intentions 2) and actually had a fairly strong plot.  Whittier Smith, a freshman in college who was a star high school cheerleader, trys out for the Stingers squad, the 7-time collegiate national champions.  She and her best friend Monica make the squad and are soon getting themselves into trouble with the snotty head cheerleader, Tina (played excellently by Bree Turner).  Soon enough Whittier and Monica get fed up with Tina and her drill seargant-like ways, so they quit and decide to form their own squad to compete at nationals.  They assemble a squad of actors and interpretive dancers, who have nothing better to do since their clubs have been shut down.  In a matter of weeks, Whittier must shape up her team for a competition in front of the school to decide which squad has the better moves.
In addition to the main cheerleading storyline, there's also a romantic interest for Whittier.  That story fell flat, in my opinion, but thankfully it doesn't occupy much of the film.
Some may say the ending is predictable, but knowing how the original Bring It On ended, I was actually not completely sure until the winner of the competition was revealed.  The cheer sequences are stunning and wonderful, although not entirely plausible given the timeframe of the film.  Still, it's entertaining enough.
The acting in the film is better than is to be expected.  Bree Turner was wonderful as Tina; she really nailed the role.  Other great performances were turned out by Bryce Johnson and Joie Lenz (those two had wonderfully catty chemistry), and Dennis Hemphill, who was hilarious as a high-on-himself actor-turned-cheerleader.
In addition to the movie, there are a few special features tacked on to the DVD.  They include some deleted and alternate scenes (most are throwaways and it's easy to see why they were cut), a trailer for the film, a ""cheer along"" that allows you to see the words to the opening cheer from the first Bring It On, the making of Bring It On Again featurette (following the film from casting to filming - pretty decent), ""fun facts"" to go along with a music video, and Tony G.'s cheer ""dos and don'ts"" which are basic rules for cheerleading as given by the film's choreographer.  Nothing too exciting there, but we're given more than most DTV movies.
Overall, Bring It On Again was a fun experience.  It has just the right combination of comedy, romance, and dance action to keep you entertained for the hour and a half that it's on your screen.",1075248000,9,2945,4.73385518590998
1959736,2,B0000YTPO8,"I did not like this movie at all, it is probably one of the worst I've seen recently. The plot was really lame, and an exact rip off of the first movie. The only good part of this movie was a small part by Zach off The OC.",1074988800,,222,3.6458333333333335
1959737,4,B0000YTPO8,"A few years back I saw a preview for a new movie called The Squad and thought it looked pretty funny. A few months later that movie was released and renamed Bring It On. I had to see it, so I dragged my brother to it and I really liked it. It was full of energy, humor, and bright color.

Then three years later I see a preview for a direct to video sequel with none of the original cast. I laugh at it and think this is going to be terrible. Then when it's finally released (about four months after the first preview said) I gave into tempation and got it.
I have to admit I went into this thinking it was going to be crap but I found myself laughing quite a bit. It had a fairly strong plot, which wasn't a rip off of the first one like I originally thought it would be. The actors were all good, which you wouldn't expect from a straight to video sequel.
The movie had good dance routines and was full of the same enegy and humor as the original. I would recomend this movie to anyone that wants to watch a fun light movie to kill a couple of hours and have a laugh.
I can't believe I'm actually going to say this, but I'd be interested in seeing a third installment!",1074988800,10,1170,4.021459227467811
