This is probably a film that only 20% of people would consider watching, and of those 20%, only 20% will understand and appreciate its symbolism and nuances. You might want to look on IMDB first and read a bunch of professional reviews both pro and con before watching this amazing film. To me watching this film was almost a spiritual experience. There's no better way of describing it. This DVD is equally excellent. Its a high bitrate transfer (better picture quality) and the details really pop out.

4444801,5,B004Q0CHB0,"The prized Palme d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, director Apichatpong Weerasethakul's hypnotic drama tells us about the mesmerizing story of a Thai man suffering from kidney failure who retreats to the countryside to die in the company of his relatives ones. As Uncle Boonmee nears the end of his life, the spirit of his late wife returns to guide him into the unknown, and his estranged son reappears in the form of a jungle spirit. Later, the ailing man leads his family on a journey to a hilltop cave where he first came into this world.

The film may be not precisely pleasant for all tastes. It demands from you to follow the rules of game and let yourself to get inside this dreamy portrait, where the time remains suspended and the flow of the narrative thread is extremely slow-paced. Every single image, every sound is sugestive, it's like you penetrate the inner thoughts of other people.

Intriguing, mysterious but fascinating, this bold film has been able to depict part of the Eastern mysticism, far beyond if you believe or not about this thorny subject.",1303776000,7,1076,4.748663101604278
4444802,5,B004Q0CHB0,"I had a chance to see this film at a festival and was quite fascinated.  I'd seen most of the director's other films on dvd.  Although he studied filmmaking in the United States, at the Art Institute of Chicago, Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul (known to those who know him simply as ""Joe"") seems almost to reinvent cinema with each new film.  There is an innocence in his eye, a freshness in his vision, that makes it feel as if he is doing something very different with his camera than what we are used to.  Scenes of nature, in particular, are sometimes included in his films to create an atmosphere or mood or to establish the emotional state of one of the characters, rather than as a strict continuation of plot.  He works in a tradition of contemplative cinema, that gives the viewer time to reflect and cause to wonder, and while his style and subject matter is quite different, I think he deserves to be mentioned alongside filmmakers such as Carlos Reygadas and Andrei Tarkovsky and Michelangelo Antonioni.  His approach to filmmaking is not far in fact from Tarkovsky's montage and memory infused&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mirror/dp/6305744114/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mirror</a>.

The basic story of Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, that won the prestigious Palme d'Or prize at the 2010 Cannes film festival, is fairly simple and based on the account of a man named Boonmee who recounted to a Buddhist priest his memories of past lives as he prepared for dying.  In this version, where Weerasethakul blends his memories of his own father and of his own youth with the story that inspired him, Boonmee is a member of Thailand's landed gentry, who returns home with some family members to die after going to the hospital and being diagnosed with acute kidney failure, for which he has to have daily dialysis treatments.  He uses his remaining time to reconnect with family and to reconsider his past.  In the telling, however, the story is not so simple.

The film opens on sounds of nature - insects, birds, animal cries; the sounds of life in the wild, outside of the home, the reminder of an ever present living world that surrounds the events taking place in the film, never quite goes away.  When, later in the film, Boonmee is visited by his dead wife, she tells him that ""heaven is overrated"" - it's this world, the world of the living,  of insects and animals and plants and spirits, where the present is infused with the past and pregnant with the future, where death and rebirth are ever present, that interests Weerasethakul the filmmaker.

The dawn slowly emerges upon a water buffalo wandering through the lush jungle.  It doesn't know or care that it's broken its tether, and is wandering free.  For the ox there are no boundaries that matter.  The bell around its neck signals to its owner that it has escaped.  But it's not so stuck on escape that it resists being led back.  Is this one of Boonmee's past lives?  Or is he the man who comes to lead the buffalo back to the fold?  Or is the catfish who has an encounter with the disfigured princess one of Boonmee's past lives?  Or is he the princess, or is he the child she conceives?  The basic assumption that underlies this film is that we can't know, that an animal could be an ancestor or a descendant, that the lives of human beings and animals are not so distant.  That realization links to two traditional Buddhist doctrines, that are not so much thematized or discussed in this film as assumed.  The doctrine of reincarnation and the doctrines of no-self and of interbeing.

In the west the idea of reincarnation seems superstitious and strange because it seems conceptually impossible that I, the same I, could inhabit the body of an animal and then of a man, or of a man and then another man or another woman.  But we need to remember that key notions of Buddhism, that accompany the idea of reincarnation are the idea of the non-self and the corresponding notion of interbeing, that to grasp oneself in truth is to recognize that the being of any one thing exists only in its unity and interpenetration with all beings.  The famous joke about how the Buddhist orders a hotdog captures this notion crudely: make me one with everything.  Related to this doctrine that the true self is the interconnected self, is the idea that what we consider to be self, the isolated ego, is no self at all.  I am not a stable self, what I call I is merely a temporary association of feelings and ideas that will pass away, like everything, and holds together only as a result of its causal relations with other things that it effects and that affect it in turn.  If there is no true self that underlies its various manifestations and all there is to the self is how it manifests itself in relation to other things at any time, then it should be clear that what we call death and what we call life are interconnected: I am always dying and being reborn, and to die is to pass into a cycle of rebirth, to become part of new lives that will themselves pass away and be reborn.  We forget this and become attached to the one self opposed to others, we put ourselves above the others and the result is war: of man against man, of man against nature.  We define ourselves in oppositional terms and cling to these fragile identities.  We think of man as essentially other than the animal, the living as essentially other than the dead, the Thai as essentially different than the Laotian.  At the same time, we think of us as unchanging and continuous, both as individuals, as national identities and as species.

If there is a consistent theme throughout Weerasethakul's work as a filmmaker it is to challenge both the assumed boundaries between us and them, or I and other, or past and future, but also to challenge the presumably simple continuity of the self or of the nation.  Boonmee's son goes in search of the monkey spirits of the forest, and ends up becoming one.  Boonmee's wife passes away, but can still come to visit.  On the other hand, Thailand is only arbitrarily distinguished from Laos by a border, and Boonmee's sister in law is mistaken to think that there is some essential difference between Thais and Laotians.  Boonmee is in one sense changed from the young man he was; and yet he feels his illness to be partially the result the impact of the violence he participated in as a soldier, killing communists.  Perhaps the most remarkable sign that he has changed, and a delightful metaphor for a central theme of the film, is the fact that he has transformed his extensive family farm in order to raise bees, in accordance with his deceased wife's wishes.  On the one hand, bees are clearly not individuals, and have their identity bound up with the life of the hive as a whole.  In addition, what allows the bee to survive is also what pollinates the many flowering plants in the farm, and thereby provides fruit and nourishment for many other creatures, so that its life is very explicitly bound up with the vitality of that which surrounds it, something we tend to forget but that Boonmee is coming to discover, and that Weerasethakul hopes to show us.  When Boonmee shares the honey with his sister in law, she is delighted.  The bee's honey, by design, combines the delicate flavors of tamarind and maize - bitter and sweet, like life.",1297987200,57,7405,4.688562596599691
4444803,3,B004Q0CHB0,"Though I was interested to see this film when it came out, I missed it, so was glad to finally get to it online.  It seemed as if it would be interesting to me because of the title, was a Cannes winner, and I love to experience different cultures and directors in film. For me it was one of those movies that once it's over, one has to keep mulling over because I didn't quite get it.  Yes, different lives of Boonmee, but they seem all jumbled together, and I couldn't figure out what they meant.  I guess the monkey ghosts are one of his early lives, a scene from early Thai history, somewhere an animal breaks loose.  I wonder if knowing more about Thai culture would have helped me.  At the end where he sees his future, the monkey ghost is back and being phased out of the future, and it seems there is some Thai political message tied in as well.  Where the past is being ripped away??  And the other characters in this film who are standing by watching all this with no reaction for the entire film.  Time in the movie also moves very slow.  Perhaps that was Thai real time when one lives among nature.  Perhaps that signified how there is no time when experiencing the span of different lives.  I wish I could be all energetic about this film as some of the 5 star reviewers are, but I haven't gotten to that place yet.  I wondered how some of the reviewers arrived at the details they saw and I didn't (like how did they know from the film the caste the main character was born into.  He was privileged but that's about all I saw. ).  Maybe I should read more about the director and this particular film to make it more clear.

Afterthought:  On thinking of this film further, and if it is just what it is, a beautiful expression using film as the artistic meaning of the person's past lives, then it is maybe more poetry than film (than a film per se); it just merely uses film as the medium the very single idea.

Certainly low-budget, there were times I thought I was watching a ""black box"" theatre piece. Fortunately, his award-winning film ventures into fantasy and dreamlike moments, taking us away from the mundane physical life known as the ""present"". Indeed, the scene with the Princess (Wallapa Mongkolpraseet)was riveting in its profound setting and sadness, an otherwise idyllic world of waterfalls and jungle beauty.

To say that I understood it all would be foolish and incorrect, though the DVD offered a generous interview with the director, attempting to reconstruct his motivations. Then I watched it again, and there was a definite flow to the proceedings.

I have respect for the director's vision, reminiscent of Alain Resnais' ""Last Year at Marienbad"", which had a more narrative flow. The director refers to this film as ""an experimental narrative"", and as such, the experiment is a fascinating success. I wouldn't presume to challenge this insightful director's vision; his approach is unique, and should be applauded.

4444811,4,B004Q0CHB0,"<strong>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</strong> (Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 2010)

Taking a trip into an Apichatpong Weerasethakul film is like nothing else in the world. You have to get yourself attuned to the way in which Weerasethakul sees the world; this is not the kind of thing you can adapt to what you think. You must adapt to him. He has a language all his own, and he's not afraid to use it. A good literary parallel would be Cormac McCarthy; once you get into the rhythm of McCarthy's language, you uncover some of the twentieth century's finest literature. So to with Weerasethakul and film. More people are doing so; <em>Loong Boonmee...</em> took the Golden Palm at Cannes in 2010. Did it deserve to? I don't know, I haven't seen everything that was up for the award. Was it one of the best movies released in 2010? Of those I've seen, easily.

There's a lot of confusion surrounding this movie, and I don't quite understand why; it's pretty straightforward when you take the title into consideration. We learn very early on that Boonmee (Thanapat Saisaymar in his only screen role) is dying; his kidneys are failing. He is looked after by a young servant/gofer. His sister, Jen (Jenjira Pongpas, who showed up in Weerasethakul's <em>Syndromes and a Century</em>) and nephew, Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee, reprising the Tong role from <em>Tropical Malady</em>, but which Tong role? First half of the movie, or second?), move in. As the film progresses, Boonmee gets closer to his deathbed, and we go through a series of scenes where, as the title tells us, Uncle Boonmee recalls his past lives. The only thing here that should be difficult is figuring out which of the characters in each scene Boonmee actually is. Some of the scenes are obvious (in the very opening scene, he is the buffalo who breaks his bonds and wanders off), some not so (what The Onion called the ""infamous carp scene""). Some it's hard to tell where real life leaves off and the hallucinations begin (the journey through the cave). But all of the hallucinatory scenes place Boonmee in his own life as much as they place him in others; we see different aspects of Boonmee's character in each. (As a side note: for those endlessly debating the final scene, think about it in light of this paragraph, and also in light of Tong's character's transformation in <em>Tropical Malady</em>. Don't think about it in any sort of linear sense, but latch onto the fact that the last scene is of a piece with those that have come before.)

As I said above, you have to get Weerasethakul's filmic language in order to fully understand what's going on here, and with <em>Loong Boonmee...</em>, as with <em>Sud Pralad</em> before it, I think a lot of the negative reaction comes form those who haven't internalized that language yet; who in some cases haven't even tried. And let's be fair: this is not a movie for Weerasethakul beginners, not in the least, in the same way that <em>Blood Meridian</em> is not the first book you want to use to introduce yourself to the work of Cormac McCarthy. Start off with earlier Weerasethakul (I will continue to recommend <em>The Mysterious Object at Noon</em> every chance I get until the day I die) and work your way up to these heavily folklore-based films, and you will have a much better idea of what Weerasethakul is on about, thematically. But even if you've no idea, as long as you don't mind very slow films and are willing to just sit back and appreciate the incredible beauty of the cinematography, you will get something out of this. ****",1312761600,9,3567,4.777957860615883
4444812,5,B004Q0CHB0,"Apichatpong Weerasethakul is nothing short of a genius. His films grace the screen with poetry and a playful irreverence at conventions. Uncle Boonmee maintains the clarity and freshness first seen in Mysterious Object at Noon while venturing into more serious subjects, partly paying tribute to his father who died of kidney disease. One can easily perceive the love poem reaching out in scenes with Boonmee.

But Weerasethakul's filmmaking genius is much more than good intentions. Consistently his films demonstrate a unique talent for cinematography, dialogue, and directing. His juxtapositions of beauty and bumbling, rural and urban, spirit and material, the ordinary and the extraordinary turn his films into sonnets, and his mostly non-professional actors play so naturally that one forgets that they are acting. Quiet is the best description. Uncle Boonmee's death is poignant and unlike anything else I've ever seen onscreen.

In Uncle Boonmee you see a man in a monkey suit, and then 15 minutes later, a rapturous vision of Shangri-La where a Princess is made love to by a catfish. In the final scenes we have to ask ourselves: Are we the past people? Are we robots hypnotized by electronic media, or a new kind of monk at a new kind of altar? We have to ask that of ourselves.",1310947200,8,1288,5.042253521126761

8437849,5,B004Q0CHB0,"Uncle Boonme opens with the scene of a water buffalo tied to a lone little tree. At first the beast seems fine with its predicament but soon realizes it can easily snap the rope and wander off. Now free, the buffalo trots for awhile and seems to be enjoying its new found freedom but when it enters a darkened forest it just comes to a stop. Here the buffalo is surrounded by many, many trees and doesn't know what to do or where to go. Before it had been tied to just one small tree and all its needs were being met by its owner. Yet now it is encircled by every tree - a jungle of vines and tangles all jumbled up among each other whose roots intermingle and to an outsider would almost seem as if it were one large living organism. The buffalo, though not really scared, is just not really able to go on any further and so it allows its human master to lead it back out of the forest to presumably be tied up again.

This opening scene is possibly the visual keys we need to understand what we are about to experience. Thai mythology, karma, reincarnation, the magical - these are all elements the film is dealing with.

Uncle Boonme, the titular character, is dying and he has done and seen things in his past that he believes have led a terminal kidney disease. He claims that it is karma that has made him ill, karma for killing the communists during an unspecified war and that his body has been infected with death itself. Boonme must now rely on modern medicine and other people to help him live and he has to navigate the world of the living to make peace with his death and his situation. Boonme has to be led back out of the jungle just like the buffalo.

One evening during dinner he is visited by the ghosts of his wife and his lost son who has become some sort of wild, ape-like creature. In any other film this would be a major dramatic moment, but here the ghosts just appear and nobody seems too put out by it as if this is a common occurrence. Later in the film, Boonme talks about a dream he once had where in the future time travelers are shown their lives projected onto a movie screen. Once their lives have been given a linear narrative they just simply disappear like ghosts.

In one of the more fantastical scenes in the film, a princess who longs to be beautiful but is rather quite plain, swims with a catfish in a dark forest pond. The catfish sees her as beautiful and begins to make love to her. Enraptured, she gives up all the material belongings that are supposed to make her more beautiful in the eyes of men, drops them in the pond and gives into life itself and the pure ecstasy of just being alive.

Though the film deals with some big questions it never makes much of a fuss about them. They are just presented as is and we are left to make sense of them as we wish. Even the final scene where two characters see themselves from outside their own bodies does not seem out of the ordinary to anyone. There is no notion of time, past, present or future - its all the same.

Boonme has a floating, lyrical quality and that fits the themes the director is trying to explore. Maybe life, like this film, really is just a floating, lyrical journey and perhaps we only make it complicated when we try to make sense of it.",1405209600,2,3253,4.255663430420712

The one thing that unites all of these intersecting realities and selves is the natural world (and for Weerasethakul that means the Thai jungle), especially the natural world at night where all of these realities and selves can sit down to a late dinner and discuss the mysteries of existence and ask each other questions. Who is Apichatong Weerasethakul? He is the dying Uncle Boonmee who has killed many communists in his day but who is now living out his final days on a coriander farm, he is his sister, he is his nurse, he is his cook, he is his dead wife who materializes out of thin air, he is his son who vanished in the jungle many years ago but has now reappeared as a monkey ghost who politely joins the dinner, he is everything and everyone that he can recall. His memory is populated by actual people and experiences but aided by television shows and feature films that affect the way he recalls and represents and frames that lived experience. Who is Apichatong Weerasethakul? He is Ingmar Bergman, Luis Bunuel, Andrei Tarkovsky, Chris Marker and Abbas Kiorastami (who all could just as well be sitting round that table enjoying a midnight conversation with the director's several selves but who make their presences known in the way Weerasethakul sequentially incorporates their distinct styles--and distinct time signatures-- into each of the five sections of his film). Weerasethakul transgresses virtually every boundary (man/nature, man/woman, old/new, high/low, magic/real, natural/supernatural) in this evocative meditation on identity and history and art but perhaps his most endearing transgression/quality is his ability to evoke the supernatural but also to find humor in his own evocations/representations (the monkey ghost looks like a man in a cheap monkey costume), so you get both mysticism and levity in virtually every frame. Rarely has a film so artfully/artlessly blended the mythical and the mundane. Highly recommended. Bears comparison with HOLY MOTORS (2012).",1375142400,3,2381,5.155038759689923
