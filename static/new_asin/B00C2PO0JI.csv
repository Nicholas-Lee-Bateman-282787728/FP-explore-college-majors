8576624,5,B00C2PO0JI,My first grandson (5 yrs. old now) loved Word World.  When I tried to find it on PBS I was very upset to find out that it wasn't being run any more.  I wanted my second grandson to have the same experience with learning words.  Thanks to Amazon it was easy to find the DVDs and I am happy to say that Word World is having the same WONDERFUL impact on my second grandson.  They should put it back on the air.,1394668800,2,407,3.926829268292683

We were recently given a complimentary copy of WordWorld : Picture Day, my daughter was given a selection of DVDs to choose from and she chose this one, even though we were unfamiliar with WordWorld. She was not disappointed! She loves the characters and I love the learning aspects of the dvd. It is perfect for her since she has been practicing her alphabet. The objects as words is such a cute and effective idea, and my daughter loves it. We will be expanding our WordWorld dvd collection!",1374796800,,532,4.552083333333333
