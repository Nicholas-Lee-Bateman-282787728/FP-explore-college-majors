3679822,5,B001L54TQO,"Ana and Ravi's ""Yoga for Beginners and Beyond"" (not to be confused with their 2005&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kundalini-Yoga-for-Beginners-Beyond-NEW-Now-with-the-MATRIX-MENU-OPTION/dp/B000BRM992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond NEW! Now with the **MATRIX** MENU OPTION!!!</a>) deserves all the 5-star ratings. Previous reviewers have described the poses and each section of the practice. I just wanted to include a few of my own observations to help those who are still undecided about buying this DVD:

1. It's a unique, creative practice, with many wonderful stretches and strengthening poses. It includes some poses (or variations) that I have not come across on any other yoga DVD (and I have too many to count).

2. I especially love the ""flow"" of this practice. The combination of Hatha and Kundalini feels great and is very uplifting. You really do get the best out of 2 great styles.

3. Time flies, even though the pace is quite slow for much of the practice.

4. Breath of fire is only used once in the main practice and once in the chair segment.

5. People who don't like sun salutes don't need to avoid this DVD. Although there's a segment called ""Yoga Salutations"" (with downdogs and high lunges), these are not traditional, repetitive sun salutes.

6. This is a very versatile DVD and should not be overlooked by intermediate practitioners. Also, exercisers who tend to resist yoga might actually like this DVD. The standing warm-up would be great to use before resistance training and the chair segment and sitting neck and shoulder exercises can be performed in front of a computer.

7. This DVD reminds me of Elena Brower's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B000WC38B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Beginners</a>&nbsp;(which I adore). Both DVDs are wonderful practices to help beginners (and even intermediates like me) improve their strength, balance and flexibility. However, both DVDs also include sequences that may be daunting or frustrating for those who are new to exercise. For instance, in Ana and Ravi's DVD, one-legged downdog, high lunge (held awhile) and warrior 3 are shown without modifications. To their credit, Ana and Ravi have called these sequences ""challenges"" and, by using the matrix or simply the ""next"" button, beginners can easily skip these segments until they are ready to progress. The DVD also includes some other challenging sequences - dolphin/plank and reverse plank - but modifications are shown.

8. You don't need flexibility to do this DVD. Although Ana is very flexible and shows her full range of motion in many of the poses, none of the poses are inaccessible for lack of flexibility. Importantly, this is an ideal practice for improving flexibility.

Finally, I would like to thank Ana and Ravi for sharing their amazing yoga with the world and for giving me such a joyous yoga experience (and a great night's sleep). I will also be buying more copies of this DVD so I can share this wonderful practice with my family and friends.",1235606400,24,3156,5.531120331950207
3679823,5,B001L54TQO,"There are so many other great detailed reviews about this DVD, so I wanted to express what I particularly liked about Yoga for Beginners and Beyond.

1.  First, I just love the Matrix option.  This is especially important for beginners, but wonderful for the rest of us too.  Everyone can choose which segments time and energy will allow for them to practice on a particular day.  This is so useful because we have different needs per hour let alone per day ;-)
If you need to just Tune In (3:00 min), Warm-Up (6:00 min) and then Relax and practice your Chanting and Meditations this is very possible.  On the next day you may want a more vigorous pracice and want to just Tune In (3:00), practice your standing warm-ups (6:00) and open your Hamstrings and Hips (3:45) and then move on to your Hips and Lower Back (7:02) this is also possible.  Other segments include Yoga Salutations (17:00) Nerve Strentgh and Core (12:00), Upper Back, Neck and Shoulder Stretch (7:00) and some very useful Primers (Breath, Energy Breath and Posture.)  There is also a nice Chair Exercise segment that can be practiced in a chair or on the floor (7:25)
2.  I appreciate that fact that Ravi and Ana realize that we may have serious time contraints or no time constraints, so the Matrix allows the viewer to practice each segment in order or mixed in any fashion needed for up to 15 segments.  Something that is unique to this matrix system is that the view can program the segments in such a way so that if they want to do the same meditation or warm-up three times in a row, it's possible.
3.  This DVD includes slow stretches and more vigorous movements.  I like the Core Power movements (I've done them twice already) because I can really feel my muscles strengthed afterwards.
4. As always, the instruction is impeccable and the practice is focused and we, the viewers, are often given the ""whys"" of why we are doing the movement, not just the ""hows"".  Ana and Ravi are always encouraging and positive.
5. As other viewers have mentioned, the background scenery and music are bright and cheery.
Add this DVD to your library-it's worth every penny!",1235347200,5,2135,4.63129973474801
3679824,5,B001L54TQO,This is the best of both worlds: Kundalini and Hatha yoga. I have never done a Hatha yoga DVD  filled with so much life!! This is what I love about Kundalini yoga. The Meditations at the end are wonderful. The Chant meditation is fun and a joy to do again and again.  I can't wait to do the DVD again. Highly recommended!!One of my favorites!!,1235347200,6,343,4.2615384615384615
3679825,5,B001L54TQO,"I had practiced vinyasa and power yoga for 12 years before getting turned onto kundalini yoga through Ana and Ravi's DVDs. So I was actually a bit concerned that this DVD would be much like my other vinyasa discs: a lot of repetitive sun salutations, a standing sequence, and a floor routine. I should have known that Ana and Ravi are more creative than that! This ends up being a great disc to introduce yogis of other styles to kundalini (much better than the other options out there on DVD).

This workout really is a great blend of poses that will be familiar to yogis who do styles other than kundalini, and kundalini techniques. If you're a true beginner and not very fit, I'd advise you to be patient with yourself and keep using the disc, as I'd place this at about an ""advanced beginner"" yoga level. There's a lot of stretching here- some down dogs, a single held plank, triangle, warrior 1 and 3, and it's mixed in very well with unique kundalini type stretches and transitions. Although I didn't end up feeling as though I'd done anything strenuous, I did feel more limber and calm when I finished. For me this will be a great disc on days when I am feeling lower energy.

I love that Ana and Ravi always include meditation and chanting in their DVDs, because these really contribute to me feeling grounded and refreshed when I finish. The pulse meditation is really good here, although I cheated and found my pulse in my fingers rather than my wrists.
My favorite part of these newer discs (well, apart from the matrix, which allows you to choose whichever options in whichever order you like) are the preset workouts. I can pick a complete routine based on the time I have each day!

My only downsides are that I wasn't in love with the distracting music during the 'tune in' (ong namo...), and I'm still not sure how I feel about the background image. Minor gripes! I love that Ana does the vocals on so much of the new music.",1235174400,8,1940,4.490084985835694
3679826,5,B001L54TQO,"This new DVD from Ana and Ravi is a great blend of exercises. I loved it right away. It's an all-in-one workout. It blends hatha yoga, power yoga, and kundalini in Ravi and Ana's beautiful way. It has MATRIX, so you can programme according to how you want to arrange it. And it has 6 sample routines ranging from 50 min. to 1 hr. and 25 mins. It's great for all levels from beginners and beyond...it's set up to work for everybody.

If you go straight through, it begins with STANDING WARM-UPS: small squats with arms overhead, standing stretching one side to another, a standing cat-cow type stretch, and twisting while squatting. Then, YOGA SALUTATIONS: an exercise of sweeping arms overhead, then holding a wide-leg squat, then a series of a forward bend exercise, Down Dog, child pose to cow pose, down dog to high lunge. Next, THE CHALLENGE: moving leg forward and back w/o touching ground, then balancing on one leg with arms and other leg stretched straight. Then, HIPS AND HAMSTRINGS: triangle pose, 2 hip openers, stretching leg while lying on your back, happy baby pose. Next, HIPS AND LOWER BACK: drawing leg into chest while lying on your back, thread the needle(hip stretch), rock on your spine, a forward bend stretch doing one leg then the other, gentle seated twist. Then NERVE STRENGTH AND CORE POWER: seated with soles of your feet together while looking up, front platform pose(kind of like the highest point of a push-up), a backward arch with your legs straight, seated forward bend with breath of fire, sitting while holding your breath out and pumping your stomach, then on your back raising alternate arms and legs, rock on spine, then seated with arms outstretched with breathing. Then, NECK, SHOULDERS, AND UPPPER BACK STRETCH AND STRENGTHEN: down dog on forearms into modified plank, then an arm movement while seated, neck turns, shoulder raises, a neck stretch. Then, DEEP RELAXATION. Then, BE STRESS FREE MEDITATION: find your pulse on your arm and say Sat Nam in rhythm with your pulse. Next, SAT NAM CHANT.(I love Ana's white outfit in this part...I want it!) Then, CLOSING PRAYER. There is also a BREATH PRIMER w/ ENERGY BREATH(4 breaths in and 4 out through nose), a POSTURE PRIMER which has standing stretches, exercises while lying on your stomach, followed by standing in mountain pose. It's like a bonus set of exercises really and they feel great! Then there are CHAIR EXERCISES: hip stretch in chair and upper body stretch movements.

All the exercises are new, with only a couple you'll have done in other Raviana DVD's. The music is bright, pulsing, and happy. Ana looks fantastic and as always, they have their wonderful voice-over instruction and positive thoughts. Definitely, a new step in my emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being. That's one of things I love about Ravi and Ana's DVDs is that each one does something new and different from the others for your mind and body(which is why I own almost all of them, so I can rotate them all! :) Their yoga works wonders inside and out. I've been doing their yoga for awhile, and have noticed the physical, emotional, and spiritual benefits. It's amazing. I already can't wait to do this DVD again! I love it and I'm sure it is going to be a new favorite!",1234915200,31,3256,4.791814946619217
3679827,5,B001L54TQO,"I switched from hatha yoga to kundalini yoga years ago because I liked how the kundalini yoga made me feel afterwards. So I was skeptical trying this DVD that it wouldn't confer the benefits I'd received from kundalini yoga. But I should have know that with Ravi and Ana's creativity, they'd find a way to get the most out of the hatha yoga postures. The exercises are challenging because they are held longer than the kundalini yoga back and forth movements. But that builds strength. The mantras kept me going. To my pleasant surprise, I felt wonderful after the exercises. It's a beautiful DVD, with fun music and excellent instruction.",1228176000,,639,4.818181818181818
3679838,5,B001L54TQO,"beautiful,effective,takes away fatigue; there are many exercises of kundalini and hatha yoga, plenty of variety, nice music; after having done it you feel refreshed and relaxed.",1389312000,,177,5.846153846153846
3679839,5,B001L54TQO,"I have been struggling with weight a long time and one of the hardest things to do is exercise. Although my flexibility is still lacking, I'm definitely feeling the muscles working. It's not intense yoga, but very much focuses a lot on breath and meditation. For me, it's been one of the best workouts I've done and most effective.",1368748800,,331,4.627118644067797
3679840,4,B001L54TQO,"This video really is very good for beginners, but the production of the DVD itself was not all that great.  The video kinda throws you right into the exercises and then at the end teaches you the fundamentals, which seems kinda backward to me.  The matrix menu let's you put the segments in the order that you'd like them to be in, but you won't know until you've already gone through the video once or twice or more.  The exercises themselves cover the whole body and are generally pretty easy to do, but there are hints of the more advanced stuff in yoga.  I would still be using this video regularly, but the music is repetitive and become irritating after a while.  Great place to start though, but I would recommend watching the last few chapters first and then the first chapters.",1367884800,,786,4.507042253521127
3679841,5,B001L54TQO,"I work a retail sales job and I have to stand a lot during the day. I've had chronic pain in my lower back which I've basically dealt with with lots of advil. Obviously that won't do. I went to a number of specialists and all they were able to tell me was, 'Do yoga.' Ana B & Ravi S's Kundalini Yoga DVD's made all the difference. I wrote to them and asked which was the best one for lower back issues. They said try this one because if your alignment isn't correct every treatment you can name will only work temporarily. I took them up on their recommendation and lo and behold my lower back pain is 95% gone! I am so grateful. This DVD has something for everyone and if you've been doing regular yoga and are curious about what Kundalini is all about, this is the perfect intro. This even has a bonus segment which has yoga you can do sitting in a chair. What's not to love!",1318896000,5,877,4.1345029239766085
3679842,5,B001L54TQO,"Final review - this practice has now become my go-to yoga practice for days when I have a cranky back or I am just blah and don't want to do anything. It all flows together so well.  I'm glad I kept it and gave it another chance back when I wasn't so sure about it. I truly love it now!

**************************
Second review:
I am writing this sequel to my original review because after working regularly with this DVD over the past year, I've decided to give it another star.  I still have not been able to confront the chanting segment again but will try it soon in the interest of being open-minded.  And I still do not like the music during the Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo opening chant - it should just be the chant and if any background noise at all, just something monotone and light.

That said, the routines in this DVD have grown on me.  I am finding it to be therapeutic for the spine and hips, as well as for nerves and down moods.  I particularly enjoy the standing segment, and if my back is really cranky I start with the chair exercises then move on to the hatha yoga segments.  The music in particular (other than my nemesis, the chanting song) have become so sweetly enjoyable that after using this DVD I hum the tunes for hours afterward and my mood remains elevated.

In sum, it seems I needed to get used to Blonde Ana and the new backdrop.  Since purchasing this video I've met Ravi and Ana at a workshop and had a wonderful experience meeting them and being instructed by them.  I look forward to their long-awaited book and new videos as mentioned on Facebook.

*********************************

** My original review on August 29, 2011 read: **

Not a favorite but the workout is still good - I'm a new Ravi and Ana fan and have to admit to being a little disappointed with this one.  This is my first of the videos in the ""blonde era.""

The first time I used this video, I programmed a matrix which included opening, a sampling of the exercises, deep relaxation and the chanting segment.  It just didn't feel right and I was very disappointed with the chanting (my first disappointment with RaviAna chanting) because it was ruined by the bizarre background chanting/music that overpowered Ana.  The weird soundtrack turned what should have been a personally sacred experience into almost a mockery of chanting.

I left it alone for a few weeks, waiting for the right time to try it again.  This time I decided to do the routine full through.  It flowed much better and I enjoyed the experience.  I did not participate in the chanting this time.  If I do decide to do it again, I plan to turn the sound off and do it, just to have the complete Kundalini experience.",1314576000,4,2690,4.456032719836401
3679843,5,B001L54TQO,"This is the best introduction to yoga I've found. I tried to get into yoga a number of times but when I did this awesome DVD I was hooked. Ana & Ravi do a great job of gently moving you along until you're doing things you never thought you could do. I have recommended this tape to all of my co-workers because they're always complaining about their stress levels. I've gone on to try their other great DVD's, notably Fat Free Yoga and Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond and I have found that this is also a great way to familiarize yourself with their amazing Kundalini Yoga style. It's a combination of the more traditional hatha yoga and Kundalini. Ana & Ravi are real pros and you couldn't be in better hands!",1302739200,,716,4.390977443609023
3679844,3,B001L54TQO,"I would like to say that I LOVE Ana Brett and Ravi Singh... and I am in no way saying that this is a ""bad"" DVD, it just wasn't for me. I teach Hatha and vinyasa yoga and I love to practice Kundalini yoga to add some variety in my practice, I like each style of yoga separately but I didn't think the mix worked well here.

This is what I didn't like about the DVD, and again this is just my opinon:

1. In the intro they claim this is a mix between Hatha/power/kundalini yoga, but there wasn't any power yoga in it
2. The back ground music during the ""tune in""... distracting
3. The segments individually are good, but they don't flow nicely one after the other
4. The ""sun salutaion"" segment lacked sun salutations
5. I liked the meditation at the end however the chanting\background music was distracting. I like them each individual but not together

This is what I did like:

1. Tom Carden's music
2. Ravi Singh's soothing voice
3. The hamstring section",1301184000,,957,4.359550561797753
3679845,3,B001L54TQO,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Ravi & Ana and I adore their other dvds. Yoga Beauty Body & Fat Free Yoga are amazing, and I was hoping for more of the same when I bought this dvd based on the glowing reviews.

Things I liked about this dvd:
*It goes by quickly.
*You can feel your muscles being worked.
*I feel relaxed after completing the workout.

Things I did not like about this dvd:
*The Matrix Menu option is very glitchy, which disrupts the flow of the workout.
*The music was too fast/a little distracting, especially during the meditation segments.
*Ravi is no longer the narrator.
*As far as Ana bleaching her hair & donning a hair piece--it makes me a little sad because she is so NATURALLY beautiful. But more importantly, if Ana is going to be spread-eagle facing the camera, the camera angle could have been more appropriate or she could have worn exercise pants for that segment. I generally like her style and outfits, but I hope to be ""seeing less of Ana"" in future videos, if you know what I mean.

Overall, I might try this a few more times, but if this was my first Ana & Ravi purchase, it might have been my last.",1300579200,3,1149,4.285714285714286
3679846,5,B001L54TQO,My first ever Yoga video.  As the dvd goes on the techniques become more advance.  First 20 minutes is really good for people who have never done Yoga.,1300579200,,151,4.357142857142857
3679847,5,B001L54TQO,"I can't say enough nice things about this DVD.  I love Ana Brett & Ravi Singh.  Together they release some awesome Yoga DVD's.  This runs about an hour long, but the time just slips by.  The poses can be completed by anyone, but it gives you a great workout.  ALSO, it leaves me with a sense of happiness every time I do the DVD.  I suggest not skipping the meditation at the end, it really makes the experience complete.

They also have chair and breathing exercises after the DVD's credits roll.",1296777600,2,497,4.395604395604396
3679858,5,B001L54TQO,"This is the best of standard hatha yoga and the more dynamic Kundalini style (as popularized by Ana & Ravi). If you are looking for: streteching, strengthening, alignment, stress relief, lower back help, hip opening, breathing benefits, yoga training, and much more, then this is the DVD for you. I recommend this one to my friends who are total beginners or who have been doing other types of yoga and are ready for the next great thing (Kundalini with Ana & Ravi). This DVD has all the makings of becoming a classic!",1290643200,2,518,4.641304347826087
3679859,5,B001L54TQO,"I am sure you many people have written 5 star reviews already but had to add that in my 4 plus years of practicing yoga I have never encountered such enjoyable and effective home yoga workouts as the ones presented by Ana Brett & Ravi Singh. You will want to collect them all. I haven't tried one that has not immediately become an important part of my rotation. This one is no exception and, though I can no longer label myself a beginner, I get a great workout because it contains almost all of my favorite poses (favorite because they are so effective) for strength and flexibility.

I love the way this workout builds. I love the challenging poses, the way Ana & Ravi give information for each of the poses and also their warm, fun energy! I really love the fresh take on Warrior 3 called ""The Challenge!""
Thank you Ana & Ravi - I am so fortunate to have you as my teachers!",1284422400,,878,4.321212121212121
3679860,2,B001L54TQO,"I am a huge fan of Ana and Ravi's. I find when I switch my workouts to more weight or even cardio intensive with less kundalini yoga, I miss their workouts and have to change my routine around again to fit in more! Maybe this routine is better for beginners who really do need a slower pace. After any of the other Ravi/Ana workouts, I feel like I've had a really challenging workout. This is the only one where I just don't feel that way. I don't feel particularly stretched, strengthened or challenged.

I like Ana's singing, but I do find it distracting during the meditations-- especially when I'm supposed to be focusing on my pulse.

If you're looking for a more energetic practice, I wouldn't recommend this one. I am a big fan of their original For Beginners and Beyond, Bliss Hips, & Fat Free Yoga.",1283990400,10,807,4.482993197278912
3679861,5,B001L54TQO,"I bought this DVD two weeks ago, and have only used it five times thus far, and I can already say emphatically that it does wonders for the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  I imagine the same would be true for other anxiety-related disorders as well.

If you have PTSD, you probably know that there's a huge physical component involved in the symptoms you suffer.  When your body can launch itself into the unmitigated, wrenching intensity of the fight-or-flight panic response at the drop of a hat, it's almost impossible to prevent your mind from being dragged along with it.  And those are pretty much the basic ingredients of the vicious, hellish agony that's called being triggered.

I've been triggered left and right in the past year of my life, which has forced me to constantly search for ways to control my PTSD and keep the trauma-demons from ripping me to pieces.  One thing I've learned is that keeping my heart rate down and my body in a state of physical calm makes an INCREDIBLE difference, and can quite often protect me from a trigger event that might have otherwise ruined and tortured me for weeks or even months.

This DVD is a freaking life saver!  I'd never done yoga before I bought this DVD and, dear god, how I wish I'd started sooner!  The calming and mood-improving effects are immediate and profound--not to mention the awesome mental clarity I experience.  By the time I'm done running through the DVD, my anxiety is gone, my body is incredibly relaxed (sometimes I almost fall asleep during the meditation exercises near the end), and my maddening sense of impending doom has evaporated.

I'm certain any good yoga DVD or class would be equally beneficial.  However, if you've got PTSD or an anxiety or mood disorder, and you've never done yoga before, or are just looking for a new good yoga DVD to try out, please give this one a chance.

After just two weeks, I can tell that yoga is something I'm going to stick with for life.  I bought this DVD because of its great reviews, and because of the phenomenally good reviews people give to all of Ana and Ravi's DVDs.  I love it so much that I've already ordered myself another DVD by these fabulous people.

Ana is adorable and Ravi's voice is super-soothing.  The routines are doable even by a physically inept newbie like myself. Sometimes I get the giggles over a few of the things they say (like during one pose, when Ana instructs you to hold yourself as if you're breathing through your eyes, which always hits me like the set-up of a nonsensical joke), and I felt self-conscious at first singing along during the parts where you chant.  That said, the melodies and music are pretty darn catchy, and I find myself singing them in the shower when I'm done.  I don't know if performing the chants really makes a difference in the overall effects of doing the yoga workout, but, heck, with the kind of results I'm getting, I'm more than willing to do every single thing they tell me to do.  :)

I visualize my relationship with PTSD in a lot of different ways.  Sometimes it makes me feel like a victim of a drive-by shooting.  In the middle of a perfectly happy, beautiful day, out of nowhere it can riddle me full of bullets.  This DVD makes me feel like I can don calm like Kevlar.",1279152000,13,3281,4.569230769230769
3679862,3,B001L54TQO,"Yes it is true this DVD is appropriate for beginners, but it's also a great one for anyone wanting a nice, relaxing yoga DVD that incorporates a lot of stretching.

In the introduction, Ana describes this DVD as a mix of Kundalini, Hatha and Power Yoga.  I don't think there is any power yoga in this workout, since it is slow moving and relaxing.

This DVD was filmed at the same time as Yoga for Beginners & Beyond: Stretch, Strengthen, Be Stress Free and and Kundalini Yoga:  Cardio, Stretch & Strengthen.  Thus, it has some of the same issues.

What I liked about this DVD:

**the different music.  It's still new-agey, but with a faster beat.

**Ana is radiant and glowing, as always.  She is a joy to watch.

**Both Ravi and Ana give instruction.  I love hearing both their voices.

**how I feel after doing this DVD.  I love doing this workout at the end of long, stressful day.  It's not too hard and it feels so good to relax and stretch my body.

What missed the mark on this DVD:

**the odd choice of scenery.  The workout is filmed against a backdrop picture from Hawaii (or maybe California).  It looks totally fake.  The lotus blossom and Buddha sitting in the corner look out of place.

**the matrix doesn't work.  You can select maybe 3 sections and then the selector freezes.  I am especially disappointed with this DVD since I like to start the workout with the breath primer, posture primer and chair exercises, which are the last chapters.  I have to pause and restart the DVD now and this breaks up the workout flow.

**Odd and inconsistent camera angles.  It's nice to see the poses from  different angles, but several poses must have been filmed at different times.  One part of a move shows Ana sitting lengthwise on the mat, the camera then switches to Ana sitting cross-wise on the mat continuing the move.  This is very distracting.

I recommend this DVD to those wanting a nice workout that incorporates lots of stretching and breathing.  If you are a yoga purist, you may not like the mix of Kundalini and Hatha yoga.",1278460800,2,2046,4.538461538461538
3679863,5,B001L54TQO,"I have all of ana and ravi singhs DVDs I really enjoy how they tape and the exercises. also watching Ana makes me want to do the best I can, what a body, if this yoga gives you a shape like hers it is well worth the money not to leave out the health benefits, don't wonder about their tapes you will be very happy with them",1275350400,,323,3.8358208955223883
3679864,5,B001L54TQO,My chiropractor said that I wasn't flexible enough and challenged me to take up yoga.  I look at all the reviews and decided on this DVD as my first introduction.  It hit my bulls eye.  I liked the different movements and how each phase seemed to build on the next. Within about 3-4 times I could already feel the positive effects.  I also liked the mediation aspect of yoga.  Combining relaxing techniques and exercising was a great match for me. I was surprised how much of a sweat I broke into with each workout.  Great stuff!  The only downside is that the actor was not visually appealing to me and sometimes that detracted from my overall experience.,1274313600,,656,4.555555555555555
3679865,5,B001L54TQO,"Well done Ravi and Ana! You have mixed the perfect blend of power,hatha and kundalini to make a fun and challenging workout to cover everything your body may need to work on. Keep the great DVDs coming I can't wait for the new ones. Be warned however that Ravi and Ana's workouts are amazingly addictive and absolutley a perfect fit into anyones life. So fit them into yours and start a new journey of wellbeing and fulfillment that you never thought possible. Thanks again Ravi and Ana.",1261008000,,487,4.609195402298851
3679866,5,B001L54TQO,"There's just something about Ana & Ravi's presentations that really clicks with me. I love that they don't take themselves too seriously but when you think about it later, everything about their teaching is really impeccable. There is a high fun factor with all of their DVDs. There is a lot of great material on this and it is like about five DVDs in one, because it has presets plus the Matrix so you can create all kinds of different workouts on different days. As I said in my other review for my other favorite, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond, I have a job which is pretty boring and there has been many a day when I can't wait to get home and do one of the Ana & Ravi DVDs. It totally makes my night and I find that at night I overindulge in things far less often when I've done my yoga.",1257379200,,800,4.167741935483871
3679867,5,B001L54TQO,"I have been doing from 20 minutes to 50 minutes of this DVD almost daily since purchasing it so it feels like an old friend by now. It incorporates both Hatha & Kundalini Yoga and really does a great job at giving all the benefits of both, i.e, fires up my fat burning muscles - thighs, backside, arms shoulders, navel, etc.. and then does a great job of stretching and releasing - so soothing! Then there is the magical invigorating Kundalini Yoga woven in. I love it! I suggest you get this one and then start getting all of the ravi/ana sets - they are amazing!",1257379200,,564,4.330188679245283
3679897,2,B001L54TQO,"From Ana Brett and Ravi Singh I love the Fat Free Yoga, Beauty Body, Ultimate Stretch DVDs and I have the Warrior Workout, Dance the Chakras, Quick Fixes, House Call and Navel Power, too. So I think I can say I am a little fan of the two. But I just can't get myself to do this DVD. The point is, that I love to do Power Yoga Total Body from Rodney Yee, too, because I feel my whole body working and it gives me more strength, but I like Kundalini Yoga, because it gives me a lot of energy.

In my opinion this one does neither the one thing nor the other as good as the other dvds I know. There is to less Kundalini to get energy, there is needed to less strength to really have this satisfying feeling afterwards.

Some reviewers said, that there was put so much love in the making of this dvd. Well I don't agree completely in this point. First, ok, it is a matter of taste, if you like the setting or not. I really do think, that it is a bit barbie-like with this background and anas blond hairpiece (and I can never believe, that this is natural blond) . But ok, it is not the most important thing. But what I didn't care so much is the fact, that you always see the same pictures of one exercise. For instance when she inhales and rounds her back, you see ana from the front, when she exhales you see her from the side. And you always see just this two angles, as if ana didn't practise the whole sequenze but they put them together as often, as they liked. I thought so at the DVDs ""Quick Fixes"" and ""House Call"" too.

Perhaps a lot of people think that is irrelevant, but it bothered me, when I wasn't sure about the exercise. And I think, there was much more love put into ""Fat Free Yoga"" than in the newer DVDs.

I am reeeeally waiting for a new dvd which gives me as much as the fat free or beauty body dvd. And I won't buy the
""Super Radiance"" in the same style like this one.",1257292800,3,1888,4.053619302949062

By the end I felt stretched and a lot less stressed-out. I really love Ravi and Ana's DVDs, and use them frequently. This one is a great addition! It combines kundalini with more familiar hatha poses, so it would make a great introduction to kundalini for someone who has never done it but is familiar with hatha yoga.",1256515200,,476,4.420454545454546

There are so many ""serious"" yoga videos out there that can be frustrating wither because of camera angle, length, difficulty, or intensity of the instructor. Because of her outfit and exceptional form, it is easy to see from the instructor what you should aim for in each pose.  You can break this video into little pieces and do what you want, do the entire thing straight through, or pick from preselected routines. Ana looks like she is having fun which makes the entire practice more accessible and lighthearted.  I love the music (please come out with a CD!!!) and the fact you can close your eyes in poses - these are often no-nos in other yoga styles. I find it really helpful to tack on one or two of the sections at the end of a long evening run not just to stretch, but to help calm the mind. This one really makes you feel like you accomplished something when you are done even if your practice was only 15 minutes!",1249430400,4,1071,4.35

Their knowledge of form and alignment, and the way they present it in down to earth and poetic ways is stellar 3. there is something for everything on this DVD. Lots of lower body, core, and upper body work 4. This is a beautiful example of what makes yoga, yoga, and not just exercise. Ana & Ravi always take you on an inner journey. 5. There is lots of bonus material including Breath & Posture Primers, Chair Exercises, and more. 6.

Also, some of the beginning yoga DVD's I tried are way too slow. They talk and talk and you don't really feel like you're doing anything. Ana & Ravi have mastered the art of conveying all the important information with regard to executing the poses properly in as succinct a manner as possible WHILE YOU'RE DOING THE EXERCISE. They also give encouragement and inspirational ideas to conmplete your yoga experience. My thighs really felt it the next day after doing this, but in a good way. Usually when I do stretching the backs of my legs are tight for days. That didn't happen with this workout. My flexibility and strength and improving every time I do this.

Flexibility, strength, toning, and the utter feeling of being at peace in the world, all come from a kundalini yoga practice.

3679905,5,B001L54TQO,"Hi everyone, I am truly hoping people will read this review.  First, let me tell you a little about myself so that you know where I'm coming from.  I have been an avid yoga practitioner for about 8-9 years, and am natually what you would call a ""perfectionist"" or ""Type A.""  Unfortunately I found this tendency also extending to my yoga practice, and began doing Power Vinyasa. I received my teaching certificate and began teaching advanced classes.  However, then, my hubby & I had a baby and I stopped teaching to be a stay-at-home mom.
I have been trying to work in my usual, advanced Power yoga workouts while baby is napping.  But I have found that I am so physically worn out and sore afterward, that it takes me days to recover & I'm really uncomfortably exhausted.
Hence, I recently tried these Kundalini Yoga DVD's again (which I haven't done in over a year), and literally tears came to eyes.  Ana & Ravi have designed beautiful DVD's (I have them all now), and my god, they are truly amazing.  For me, they cut through all my Type A-ness and I feel OK with exactly who I am, in the moment, without judgement, comparison, etc.  I lose myself in the exercises and at the end not only feel physically stimulated and challenged (*without* getting overly sore), but also emotionally lightened and mentally like I've taken a vacation.  I find I actually breathe easier after doing one of these DVD's.  I honestly wish everyone would try them - not only would people feel better on every level, but the world would be a kinder, more compassionate place.  I've never written a review by the way, so maybe that also says something about how ""on a different level"" this product is.",1246492800,21,1682,4.591973244147157
3679906,5,B001L54TQO,"I really enjoy all of their programs & found this to be fun as well. I am 66 & have been doing Yoga for 20 plus years. I have many of Ana's DVD's & try to do one each day. I have many other exercise programs as well but I always come back to yoga because it can be can be practiced anywhere at anytime. I love Kundalini Yoga,this DVD is a great way to start if you are new to yoga,instructions are very clear.",1244419200,2,409,3.823529411764706
3679917,4,B001L54TQO,"Fun and challenging on many levels. The logistics of the matrix menu are not as smooth as on other DVD's but still love it.  I look forward to the meditations at the end, especially the Sat-a-Nam Wahay Guru meditation/chant.",1243987200,,224,4.743589743589744
3679918,5,B001L54TQO,"First of all, the music is very uplifting!  I could play the cover song for hours!  These 3 new DVD's have gone up several notches above perfect.  The set is lovely, Ana's moves are quite graceful.  This is the first time I am working out for months, as I broke my toe. I feel like a beginner again!  When I started doing Ravi and Ana'a DVD's a few years back, my lower back soreness and stiffness went away.  I am looking forward to the same effect now.  The warm-ups include twisting and bending. This feels a little bit more like popular Yoga moves (Hatha?) blended in with Kundalini, which I love for the sheer fun of it. There is a lot of stretching moves.  I am taking it easy now.  Gradually I can get more into it.  There is a down dog, but not for too long.  Cat/cow, and back to down dog, to lunge, to warrior, back to down dog, and back and forth, lifting legs in down dog. As usual, after exertions, there are short meditation moments.  I love the way the music transitions.  There is a balance segment.  I need to work up to it, and I know I will.  As usual, Ana and Ravi explain the why's and how's of each exercise.  I love the triangle pose, and rotating the pelvis and hips back and forth with the arm movements.  More hip and thigh movements, then happy baby pose.  More movements on the floor, on back, including thread the needle exercise for the sciatica. More stretching and twisting on the floor. Then there is a long armed plank pose.  Then you are balancing on feet and hands with hips raised up.  More stretching, and breath of fire.  There is a breathing meditation. As usual, you can hear the breathing so you know where you are.  On her back, Ana lifts her arms and legs alternately, good for core.  after rolling on her back, cross-legged, Ana lifts arms parallel with the floor, and holds them there.  She does down dog on her forearms and elbows, into modified plank. Then there is a seated arcing, and straightening of the back with arm movements.  More twisting, seated, left and right with neck.  Then alternate shoulder-raises, and into both shoulder raises.  I am now picturing my spine getting more free, flexible and healthy.  Then there is laying down deep relaxation, and a seated meditation. Then a sing along mantra, Sat-a-Nam Wahay Guru. This all seems to come from the heart.  Words onscreen. After a lovely closing prayer, there are credits with fantastic music. I really enjoy this, and, it reminds me of a movie ending.  After the credits, there is another breath meditation, transitioning into a breath primer. Then more stretching, and a standing tutorial.  There is a knee-joint exercise, followed by mountain pose.  There are chair exercises.

I can't wait until I can purchase this music.  It is all very nice.  This may sound silly, but while my toe was broken, I listened to the DVD's to stay calm through my classwork.

The Matrix option, the pre-set workouts, and the chaptered sections are all handy.",1243728000,2,2958,4.557034220532319
3679919,5,B001L54TQO,This is a great dvd that will ground and relax even an intermediate or full fledged yogi.  What I liked best was the familiar hatha combined with a Kundalini twist and take.

Yesterday I tried a beginner's set (they have pre-programmed routines you can play through if you have no idea where to start) and I can ALREADY breathe better.  Just my FIRST HOUR of this DVD opened up the tightness in my lung and chest area (I spend all day cramped over a computer).

It's very comprehensive, easy to folllow, and Ana & Ravi's instruction and Ana's demonstration are really as good as it gets. Bravo, I say!",1242345600,,481,4.517241379310345

3679924,5,B001L54TQO,"This DVD is perfect for stretching your body in every direction from head to toe and the deep breathing which accompanies Hatha yoga has a very relaxing effect on the body and mind which makes it ideal for a Sunday afternoon or in the evening to unwind.

Since I started practicing Kundalini yoga, I have been letting my Hatha yoga DVDs gather some dust because I have felt such a profound effect from Kundalini yoga. But this DVD makes me remember some of the reasons that I do love Hatha yoga as well. I had forgotten how nice it feels to just balance within a pose and breathe so deeply. It is both challenging and relaxing at the same time.

In the chair exercises segment, the exercises shown can be done with or without a chair but it just shows that you really can do Kundalini yoga anywhere. I love this little ""mini set"" and will probably memorize it so that I can ""take it with me"" wherever I go. I think it's a great way to rejuvenate and loosen up after sitting for long periods of time. The exercises Ravi and Ana chose for this segment give you a way to get a lot done in a short period of time.

As always, Ravi and Ana have created an excellent workout with wonderful music and instruction. I will use this DVD whenever I feel I need to slow down and re-balance.",1241913600,3,1278,4.2727272727272725

I own several of their DVDs and I rotate them in the course of a week. Overall, I feel healthier, happier, sleep better, and I even like myself better.

3679947,5,B001L54TQO,"I had been hearing amazing things about the Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVD's on a popular video fitness website. I tried their Ultimate Stretch Workout which I loved, so I was really curious to give one of their new titles a try. It is as great as everyone says it is. This dynamic duo has the perfect synergy. Ana is a great athlete who demonstrates the yoga impeccably (but you never get the sense that she is showing off). Also, her voiceover is very melodious and I love listening to her words. She also sings in some of the accompanying musical tracks: a triple threat! Ravi's voiceover is very soothing and I love the things he says. These exercises are perfect for a beginner because you get a total workout: legs, core, arms, and everything else, but there are no poses which a beginner would find prohibitive. That's why this workout truly is for beginners and beyond. This DVD also features the matrix menu option, which allows you to customize your workout. There is also bonus material: chair exercises (which I've already done with my two nieces), a posture primer (which is genius), and a breath primer I (which is profound). The music on this will appeal to everyone who's tired of that new agey elevator music on most yoga DVD's. It really motivates you during your workout. Bottom line: you can pay $15 - $20 for a live yoga class and never get close to the level of the teaching on this DVD. Another great offering from two ""modern masters.""",1240272000,7,1455,4.557251908396947

I wanted to do Hatha but always struggled with the postions and the boredom factor. I just knew Ana & Ravi would make it fun and I was not disappointed!!!! I find this to be the perfect yoga DVD! I felt different after the very first session, as if I had rearranged some musculature and my rear view was sitting higher. There is wonderful hip music as well with Ana's sweet vocals.

I am an advanced beginner exerciser and I do a full hour of this whenever I use it, which is often. I find it feels wonderful on my back, especially since I have a tendency to tighten up there or strain it a bit when doing other workouts. I also love the hip opening sequence. This DVD has, in my opinion, the best back and leg stretches of any of their workouts.

Since using Raviana's tapes, I have lost 12+ pounds and am on my way to a new body!

Another thing I love about this tape - and their others - is that there is no endless sequence of Sun Salutations. The moves are unique but focused, and I never look at the clock while doing these!",1239580800,7,735,4.097222222222222

I love the new sets with zen water views, the music is very next gen ""anime"" suave but it works, and the matrix where you design your own workout is completely the best thing ever. There are posture and breathing tutorials. Ana & Ravi's have both got their sounds and images launched in the new milennia. For a second I admit, I did find myself wondering what happened to Ana's gorgeous raven tresses and was worried she turned into yoga barbie, but I also couldn't help thinking at the same time that she looks amazing! And I want to be her! She looks sleeker than ever, if a tad skinny, and very in her yoga warrior element. Very Inspiring and breathtaking! Get this DVD!

3679955,5,B001L54TQO,"Another a great product from the Ravi and Ana team.  I have been practicing Kundalini yoga for the past three years through the wonderful dvds offered by Ravi and Ana. Thank you for another great dvd.

For those new to Kundalini yoga, it is strongly advised for you to watch the whole dvd and then practice the whole dvd before going into the matrix options.  Reason: Kundalini yoga incorporates a lot of breath work and hence I do believe you will need to incorporate some breathing option offered when you build your own shorter workout.  Again, try it and you will see the difference!  You will need to put aside 1 hour 42 minutes for the whole dvd workout that will take you through the breath work, the targeted release of stress pockets in your body and then the great meditation options.  I always feel physically, mentally and spiritually renewed everytime I practice with the dvd.  The matrix option offered me quicker focused workout in the mornings.

the dvd focuses on stress 'knots' in your lower back, hips, shoulders, neck and surprisingly the spine.  The moves are gentle for beginners, but effective enough to 'pop' those stress knots.  If you have severe stress knots, I would recommend some deep  tissue massage as well, but regular use of this dvd has seen a noticable reduction of massage trips for me.

I particulary love the stress meditation as we are all experiencing very stressful events in our life that are mainly out of our control.  I am having a very stressful personal experience, and the meditation options have really helped my mind and body some relief from the spiral of negative thought and fears.

In sum, the combination of movements, breathing and meditation is the reason why I love the Ravi and Ana products.  The gentlesness of their voices and messages are so comforting in a world that offers the contrary.  For a convert, one had to buy it; but if you are new - BUY it and try it.  I hope you will love the benefits that it will bring to you.",1238284800,7,1989,4.621082621082621
3679956,5,B001L54TQO,"I enjoyed the work presented in this DVD.  I tried it for the first time having just got over a terrible cold/flu, and I thought, what a great way to enjoy breathing again! The new set design looks great...I love the tranquil scene in the background and the new music; I found both to be very inspiring.  I also like the addition of the pre-set selections.  I like the matrix too, but with the pre-sets you can chose these ""pre determined"" workouts based on your needs/time.

The additional sets, such as the posture primer, are quite useful. I think it is always a good idea to go back to the basics and check into your posture..to make sure everything is balanced.  As a belly dance instructor, I could see myself using some of the techiques to correct posture in this DVD for my beginner belly dance students.

Ana looks gorgeous and radiant, as usual!  Her smile makes me smile...I almost feel like I am right there with her during the workout.

Thanks again Ravi and Ana for producing a great quality DVD:-)",1237852800,3,1012,4.521978021978022
3679967,5,B001L54TQO,"This is a superior holistic workout that leaves you feeling very calm.

As usual Ana and Ravi's attention to detail is perfect, music is brilliant, and Ana together with Ravi's instruction enables you to execute each move and, (importantly) understand why the position is good for you!

The most notable outcome after completing an Ana and Ravi workout is no food cravings!  Staying emotionally balanced all day and maintaining energy levels are an added bonus.

Again, I would recommend without hesitation.",1237852800,7,507,5.222222222222222
3679968,4,B001L54TQO,"I have and love many of Ravi and Ana's dvd's as they have really impacted my life tremendously in the physical and the spiritual realms.  I find this new one intensely challenging--perhaps a little too challenging for me as I can be a bit weak at times, and in some ways the dvd is a bit ""busy"" for my taste, as when I come home at night to do yoga I like to find a little more peace and simplicity, even if I am involved in movement.  I do like the lovely set and I think Ana's new look is stunningly beautiful.  However I think I will find myself doing some of the earlier dvd's more often--especially Fat Free/Lose Weight and Dance the Chakras, which I love.  I also have several of Ravi's older books and I use some of the workouts from there. I think this one will work well for many people who are up to a greater fitness challenge.",1237420800,3,838,4.154320987654321
3679969,5,B001L54TQO,"This is an excellent all around yoga DVD. In comparison to other ravi/ana DVD's I would say this one is moderate level, but can be adapted to beginner--it is challenging in a nice way. This particular workout is very well put together, is well balanced, and has plenty of options for the matrix to choose from. Although there is some minor glitch with the matrix option at times when it doesn't always work--but I think that may be DVD player compatibility issue. Overall, I would say that out of other 7 ravi and ana DVD's that I have, this one is at the top. Love it!",1237334400,6,569,4.377358490566038
3679970,5,B001L54TQO,"I am a proud owner of all of Ana and Ravi's DVDs. They have had such a positive impact on my life (and my husband's too) that we make sure to obtain all of their new offerings.  Each one is truly different: Yoga for Beginners and Beyond does not disappoint.

For those who are familiar with their series, you'll notice that Ana is sporting blond hair and the scenic background is a nice change.  The incorporation of hatha and kundalini techniques is seamless and covers the fundamentals, which serve as precursors for more advanced practice.

The poses are deceptively simple, but you get a real work out! At the same time, I feel more grounded and at peace after completing the exercises and meditations. This is particularly important given all the uncertainty that it going on these days.

Innovative music in the background gives an uptempo feel and is a nice complement to the exercises.  I am not sure but I think Ana is voice behind many of the songs in the DVD, well done!

Thank you for this wonderful DVD, I can't wait to try Ana and Ravi's Kundalini Yoga Stretch and Strengthen, which my husband and I plan to do tonight!!!",1237075200,4,1135,4.561576354679803
3679971,5,B001L54TQO,"I did Kundalini yoga many years ago in college and loved it.  I also have many of Ravi's out-of-print videos.  There was one I really like that combined power yoga with kundalini (called ""Higher Power Yoga"" I think...).  This DVD is similar in that it is traditional hatha yoga combined with a kundalini.  It is more beginner / intermediate though.

The DVD is very well produced with great music and a clean bright set.  They give a lot of form pointers.  I also like the sound of the breath because it helps keep your focus while practicing.  The holds are long here and it feels good.

My favorite section with the neck and shoulder section which really unwound my tight shoulders.  The final relaxation was ""aahhh"".

I would recommend this DVD to beginners and intermediates to yoga.  The meditation and breath work really bring home the most important aspects of yoga.  And the DVD can easily be used section by section if you want a shorter practice.",1237075200,7,956,4.652694610778443
3679972,4,B001L54TQO,"Yoga for Beginners & Beyond is one of three new DVDs from the husband/wife team of Ravi Singh/Ana Brett.  As with their previous videos, the workout features Ana alone on screen while she and Ravi take turns providing voiceover instruction.  However, gone is the plain white studio and the furry little rug; here Ana uses a traditional yoga mat, and she practices on a raised platform, surrounded by columns and against a painted backdrop of a tranquil lake scene.  In the Introduction to this workout, Ana states that Beginners & Beyond is a combination of hatha, power, and kundalini yoga styles, incorporating the best of all three.

The Main Menu of this DVD reads as follows:
*Play DVD
*Chapter Selections
*Design your own Workout Matrix Menu Option
*Matrix Tutorial
*Pre-Set Selections

With these new DVDs, Ravi and Ana have offered a Matrix option; this option allows you to customize your own workout by selecting any of the chapters in any order (up to 15 total) to create your own yoga practice.  Each DVD also has Pre-Set Selections which provide a variety of additional routines.  When you choose ""Pre-Set"" off the Main Menu, you reach a screen which offers tips on programming your own Sample Pre-Sets.  There are then two additional screens with Pre-Set routines as follows (includes times in minutes):

Sample Routines
*Sample Routine ONE for Beginners (62)
*Sample Routine TWO for Beginners (50)
*Sample Routine THREE for Beginners (52)
More Sample Routines
*Creative Sequencing Routine ONE (53)

*Standing Warm-Ups (6:00)
*Yoga Salutations for Beginners & Beyond/The Challenge (17:35)
*Hamstrings & Hips (9:45)

The yoga sequences presented here definitely incorporate more traditional hatha yoga than what is typical of Ravi and Ana's previous yoga DVDs.  Some of the recognizable hatha postures include triangle pose, warrior 3, down dog, high lunge, reclined leg stretch, plank pose, upward plank, happy babies pose, thread the needle, and dolphin pose.  But there are also differences:  for example, the ""Yoga Salutations"" are not the sun salutations of hatha yoga but rather an alternate plie-standing forward bend sequence, and there are other more unique elements, such as the stomach pumping exercise featured in the Nerve Strength & Core Power chapter.  However, one of the hallmarks of the kundalini yoga style, Breath of Fire (BOF, or Bastrika), appears only once during the main practice sequence (i.e., Introduction through Closing Prayer, which is just over 80 minutes in length), although it is also used during the Chair Exercises segment--here it is combined with flowing arm movements as is more typical of Ravi and Ana's past kundalini work.

A few other important things to note.  First of all, the font used for the DVD menus, especially the submenus, is VERY small--so small, in fact, that I found it impossible to read the submenu selections on my 13"" workout room TV (although when I played the DVD on my computer, the text appeared clearer).  Also, the ""Beginners"" label in the title of this workout is somewhat misleading; parts of this DVD are quite challenging, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone who is new to yoga.  On the other hand, this DVD might be a good bridge for someone who is familiar with hatha yoga but new Ravi and Ana's workouts and/or the kundalini style.  As for myself, I practice hatha yoga regularly and like doing a little kundalini once and awhile for a change of pace.  This DVD is very well-done, and I particularly enjoyed certain segments--such as the hip-opening and shoulder work.  At first, I didn't particularly care for the blending of the hatha and kundalini yoga styles; I love hatha yoga, but this just wasn't what I was expecting from Ravi and Ana.  Over time, however, I've grown to appreciate this practice more, and my current rating (updated as of July 2009) would be 4 1/2 stars.  Furthermore, I think that most Ravi and Ana fans are likely to enjoy this DVD, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others as well.",1236297600,8,4535,5.097297297297297
3679973,5,B001L54TQO,"Ana & Ravi have outdone themselves this time with the super fun yoga fusion fitness extravaganza. The first section features deep stretching and core work and then you are rewarded by an easy-to-follow and totally fun cardio section. There is also an extended cardio section which is over 20 min. which you can program into your workout if you're so inclined. If you are like me and want the best of both worlds: yoga and kick butt cardio, then I would say this is one to definitely try.",1236038400,2,487,4.545454545454546

I enjoyed the workout very much and felt it was a nice challenge with great streaching and even had my favotite standing postures included.  I really feel this DVD has  blended differny styles of yoga together to make a complete perfect yoga practive. Five stars for this one I love it!!",1236038400,2,510,4.382978723404255
3679975,5,B001L54TQO,"I have been practicing Kundalini Yoga for several years, daily, and find it exceptionally transforming and empowering. I like and do regularly all of Ana and Ravi's DVDs and I can see that this one will be a valuable addition as well. Like all their DVDs it has some unique aspects but provides the same benefits.

When I first tried this DVD I only planned to do about 30 minutes, but I just couldn't stop - I was having so much fun, there was just nothing else I would have rather been doing, so I did the whole thing, 1 hour 40 minutes, including all the bonus segments. Loved it - it has a variety of exercises, nothing too hard, the matrix makes it very, very customizable, and the exercises are just wonderful.

The DVD begins with the Standing Warm-ups - and the Tune In is also done standing. I sort it was very refreshing - good to see it's the content and the intention that matter, not sitting perfectly cross-legged.
The Warm-Ups include some nice spinal twists, gentle bends - the whole section is very gentle and feel-good.

Then, there is the Sun Salutes section - not traditional Sun Salutes, but two rounds of several poses, including a variation of a deep plie squat, Forward bends, Down dog, High Lunge, etc., followed by a short Balance Segment - work your way up to Warrior 3 - very fun, nothing too hard.

After that, there is a Hips and Hamstrings Segment - Triangle, Several Hips Openers, Hamstring Stretches, some exercises for hip mobility, happy baby, etc - just wonderful. I always like Ravi and Ana's commentary - during the Happy baby pose Ana says something like: ""Babies don't get hung up on negative emotions - they have their moments and then let it go"" :)
Hips and Back section follows - more hip stretches and exercises for the back, again, quite wonderful.

After that we move onto the section called The Nerve Strength and Core Power - it starts with a sort of a hips and chest opener, then there are some core strengthening exercises, planks, etc - but nothing too challenging, and the poses aren't held for too long. There are also several breathing exercises, which I personally loved - one with the breath held out and pumping your stomach - i found this exercise hard before - but again, in this DVD we don't hold the breath out as long - or maybe it is the sequencing here - but it just felt really good.

Then we move onto to Upper Body - this section includes some strengthening exercises - dolphin to plank, etc - then there are some very nice chest openers and shoulder and neck openers and stretches - including active release, like shoulder shrugs, etc - very, very nice.

Deep Relaxation follows, very soothing and rejuvenating, then there's a Stress Release exercise - - you sit cross-legged with the right fingers on the left wrist and you say Sat Nam to the rhythm of your pulse. There's also a Singing Mantra For Healing - it's called Sat Nam Chant, then Closing Prayer.
I also did the Bonus Segments - Breath Primer, Posture Primer and The Seated KY Exercises.
Posture Primer deserves a special mention because I think it's definitely one of my favorite parts of the DVD. There are some moves where they teach you how to distribute your weight correctly, some exercises designed to realign your spine and pelvis properly, etc - I thought it was remarkably well done and I am especially grateful for it.
A wonderful DVD overall, very accessible to people of all fitness levels and very versatile - and very uplifting!",1235692800,10,3472,4.581320450885668
3679976,5,B001L54TQO,"Over and over again, I am struck by Ana and Ravi's amazing ability to create wonderful yoga sequences that leave my body and mind feeling GREAT and also are so much fun!

For years I had put fitness in that category of something not very enjoyable, but something that I ""should"" do. Then I discovered yoga, and then Ana and Ravi's amazing DVDs, and now I am hooked! Ana and Ravi give a real gift to the world by being authentic, sharing what they love, and bringing so much energy, joy, and pleasure to the process of building strength, flexibility and reducing stress - it is contagious. I literally jump out of bed in the morning when I know I'll be doing one of their DVDs, and this one is no exception.

Other reviewers have done a beautiful job of detailing the great, unique, fabulous and fun exercises that are on the DVD. I would add that if you are a beginner, take to heart their great encouragements about doing only as much as works for you as you get started, and use the helpful breath primer and posture primer to familiarize yourself with things to start. I am also a yoga teacher, and I think that this DVD has SO much to offer people at all levels in terms of overall physical and mental wellbeing, while at the same time being FUN. I know for me that if something is not fun, it's not likely that I'll stick with if for too long, but that's not an issue with this DVD!

In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Yoga for Beginners and Beyond: Stretch, Strengthen and Be Stress Free! has the matrix menu, which allows you to customize the length of your workout.

Introduction/Tune In (3:00):  The introduction is, irritatingly, not a separate chapter from the tune-in.  So you have to watch (or fast forward through) the entire introduction before you do the tune-in segment.  The tune-in segment, itself, is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs, except that you stand (instead of sitting) while chanting ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Standing Warm-Ups (6:00): This is somewhat different from the warm-ups in Anas and Ravis other DVDs. I happen to think its great, just for variety. This segment consists of the following exercises.  As the chapter title implies, the entire sequence is done while standing.

*Interlace your fingers with your arms up and your palms pointing towards the ceiling; bend your knees, then stand straight (and repeat)
*With your arms up (fingers no longer interlaced), lean to one side while dropping the arm on that side, then do the other side (and repeat)
*With your feet hip width, put your hands on your bent knees and do a version of cat/cow pose
*With your forearms on your inner thighs and your knees bent, twist up and raise the arm on the side you're turning to

Yoga Salutations for Beginners & Beyond/The Challenge (17:35): You have to do both of these together.  Although they're slightly different in nature, they're not separately selectable from the chapter menu.  (The Challenge is pretty short, though.)  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Inhale your arms up, exhale to prayer (repeat)
*With your feet wide and angled out, hold a plie with your hands in prayer
*Hold your opposite elbows, rest your forearms on bent knees and hold; then have your hands come down to the floor; then come all the way down and swing your torso while holding opposite elbows
*Repeat the plie and the move right after
*Downward-facing dog
*Sequence where you do cow pose, tuck your toes, deepen the pose, then go back to child's pose (Ravi walks you through and you breathe in time with the poses)
*Downward dog, bring one leg back, then bring it forward to a lunge and hold; repeat on other side
*Do the downward dog/lunge sequence again
*Standing, sweep one leg forward and back; then go into warrior III (though Ana and Ravi don't call it that)
*Hold your leg straight out in front of you while standing up
*Repeat the warrior III and leg held in front on the other side

Hamstrings & Hips (9:45): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Triangle pose
*Sit with your feet flat and your knees bent and separated; rotate your knees left and right; later add a raised arm
*Lie on your back, bring your legs up and then out to the sides and hold your thighs (static pose)
*One leg straight up and the other along the ground; hold behind your thigh (static pose)
*Happy baby (on your back with your knees bent and feet off the ground, calves perpendicular to the ground, and hold your big toes)

Hips & Lower Back (7:00): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*On your back, bring alternate knees into the body and bring your head to your knee
*Roll side to side on your back while holding your bent knees
*Cross one shin over the opposite thigh (opposite knee bent); reach through the opening between your legs and grab your hand, then pull your thigh towards you
*Seated, put the sole of one foot on the opposite thigh, sweep your opposite arm over the extended leg (repeat)
*With your legs in front, bend one knee and twist your torso in the direction of the bent knee

Nerve Strength & Core Power (12:00): This segment consists of the following exercises.  (It's one of the tougher segments on the DVD.)

*With your feet in butterfly and your hands behind you with the fingertips pointing forward, push your chest out and look up, head slightly back
*Front plank
*Reverse plank (that is, sit with your legs in front and your hands behind with your fingers pointing away, then raise your pelvis up)
*With your legs extended, angle forward and do breath of fire (the only exercise in which you do breath of fire in this DVD)
*Pump your stomach with the breath held out
*Lying on back with your arms extended above you, raise alternate legs and arms
*Seated with your hands in a mudra (hand position), hold your arms straight out to the sides

Upper Back, Neck & Shoulder Strengthen & Stretch (7:30):  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Move between downward dog and plank while on your forearms
*Seated, with your arms at your sides and your elbows bent and your hands in a mudra (hand position), take your head and elbows back, then bring your head down and elbows forward
*Turn your head right and left, then add shoulders to the turns as you go on
*Hold your knees and raise alternate shoulders, then do both shoulders at the same time
*Extend one arm and bend the palm down/back with the other hand; tilt your head to stretch your neck

Deep Relaxation (4:35): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen.  There's nothing particularly remarkable or particularly irritating about this segment.

Be Stress Free Meditation (6:20): With your left palm in your lap, find your pulse with your right hand.  Repeat ""sat nam"" mentally in rhythm with your pulse.  Please note that the music in this segment may interfere with your concentration.  I would've preferred something instrumental here.

Sat Nam Chant (5:45): This is pretty simple, you just repeat the mantra listed below, only in a sing-song way with repetitions of different phrases to get through one round.  I will say, I'm not happy with the music here, either.  The recording of the guy singing it sounds OK but it is really difficult to sing along and have it sound nice, with an appropriate melody.  I find myself liking this segment less than some of Ana's and Ravi's other meditations because of the music.

Sat-a-Nam Dhan-a Wahay Guru

Closing Prayer (2:55): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

Breath Primer: Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique. I think this is the exact same segment as was included with some of Ana's and Ravi's other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs.

Energy Breath: This very short segment also doesn't play if you just play the entire DVD through.  You sit cross-legged and inhale in four parts through the nose, then exhale in four parts through the nose.

Posture Primer (6:25): This segment appears on some of the other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs and is more focused on having good posture in general than on any of the specific poses in this DVD.

Chair Exercises (7:35): Another one that may not appear if you just play the DVD through.  This consists of exercises done while seated in a chair.  Please note that some of these are still pretty complicated and may not be suitable for people suffering from mobility problems.  They are NOT modifications of other moves and postures in the DVD.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Cross one ankle over your opposite thigh and angle forward
*Cradle your calf in your forearm
*Stretch your leg up at a 45 degree angle
*Repeat the previous three exercises on the other side
*With your arms out to the sides and your elbows at right angles, take your arms and head back, then bring your arms together and your head forward
*Swinging arm movements (up, back, cross in front, back)
*Interlace hands behind your head, extend your hands until your arms are straight, then bring the hands back down (repeated rapidly)
*Then hold your interlaced hands in the upward position and do breath of fire

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the newer ones with the concrete floor, white pillars, fake nature background, and blonde Ana. Both Ravi and Ana narrate and Ana demonstrates the poses and movements. The music mostly Ana singing mantras set to an instrumental track.  You'll recognize some of it if you've done Ana's and Ravi's other DVDs.

As usual, I don't care for the camera work in some parts of this program. It seems to jump around randomly, and sometimes there are zooms in and out between camera angles that are jarring. Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer standard (boring) camera work where you can always see what Ana's doing, with no unnecessary visual effects.

With regards to the title of the DVD, I think this is much more suitable for beginners than the other Yoga for Beginners & Beyond (without the subtitle) that Ana and Ravi have put out.  It introduces you to concepts like breath of fire in a controlled way (not all at once; there's actually very little of it here) and has a lot more in common with hatha yoga (which people will be familiar with), while slowly introducing some of the repetitive movements that kundalini yoga is known for.  There aren't a lot of modifications offered, although there are certain poses where a block or strap could come in handy (use your own judgment there).  Also, don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana, nor do you have to stretch as far forward as Ana in the forward-bending moves. Work at your own pace and do what YOU can.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular. (I intend to include a version of this in all my reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs.)

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has downward dog, plank, and triangle  pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you (although I note this DVD is somewhat more hatha-like than Ana's and Ravi's other DVDs). Keep in mind that Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD contains a mantra chanting segment as well as the mantra ""sat nam"" repeated mentally. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives and use the matrix menu or your DVD remote to skip the chants. (I happen to like the chants, but that's just me.)

With respect to calorie-burning, this DVD is probably not going to do a ton. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day. (I do about 30 minutes of yoga a day by combining segments using the matrix menu. Ana and Ravi are a part of my fitness routine, but they are not the whole of it.)

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch the DVD first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the ability to omit the instructional segments later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do triangle pose; you know it by this point!

A few health claims are made in this DVD. Take those that do appear with a grain of salt. I do find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues. The leg and back exercises are particularly useful if you've got problems with sciatica.  At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a sequence, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.  4.5 stars.",1417392000,7,14468,4.5963480963480965
8317316,3,B001L54TQO,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as some of her earlier DVD's.  Ana looks too skinny--hard to look at.  I hope she puts on some weight soon--I'm a little concerned about her health.  Some of the moves were too difficult for me, but I guess that gives me something to work toward.  I did enjoy the music--uplifting and fun.",1413072000,,321,4.3
8317317,5,B001L54TQO,I love the variety that raviana build into their DVDs -- and this one definitely has exercises that you don't see on their others. The first time through I dismissed at as a little too easy (I was mistaken.) I have come back to it again and again.  It has a really nice balance of 'regular' (hatha?) yoga and Kundalini.  The intro is all standing which is quite a change. Some of the exercises just feel so great it puts a smile on my face!  This one is also quite kind on the middle age knees (although i have worked out ways to accommodate in all their DVDs.)  highly recommend!,1409702400,,580,4.245454545454545
8317318,1,B001L54TQO,Very strange vibe from these dvd's. I'm not exacty sure why they are so popular. The reviews are fantastic but I can't get past the strange vibes,1402617600,,145,4.407407407407407
8317319,2,B001L54TQO,"This video had different workouts which I liked, but instead of the workout flowing in one sequence, they were just chopped up and played in that order. This made it difficult because the instructor would go from a sitting or floor pose, and then all of a sudden she was standing up. I didn't like that at all. Some of my favorite poses and sequences are not included in this workout which was very disappointing.",1391731200,,413,4.52
8317320,2,B001L54TQO,"I would not start with this video as a beginner, as I did.  Ana Brett, as a pro, can get herself into all sorts of contorted positions, but as a beginner, these positions are difficult, if not impossible.  There is absolutely no help in descriptions of ways to effectively modify any of these positions if you are brand new to yoga, as I would expect from a ""beginner"" video.  There is no real transition from one chapter to the next, so when I was watching the part on breathing and positions (which it states beginners should do) the next thing I know they are showing positions in a chair that include lifting a bent knee clear up to your chest.  There was no clear explanation that we had moved on to another part of the video, and I didn't need to be following along.  I will say however, that the chapter on breathing was helpful, but as for that, ignore the ""beginner"" part of the title and wait until you are more familiar with ""& beyond"".",1390435200,,947,4.357954545454546
8317321,5,B001L54TQO,"I purchased this for my 30 yr old daughter, who wasn't sure if Yoga was for her.  This got her hooked!  After previewing it I purchased another for myself (I've had a daily yoga practice for years).  It instructs, energizes and provides meditation t/o for calm.  You can pick and choose what you have time for each day or use the preprogramed sets.  When I have time I just play the whole DVD which is about 90 mins.  Great value for the money.  My daughter does daily and says it helps with her stressful job.",1389830400,,510,4.3052631578947365
