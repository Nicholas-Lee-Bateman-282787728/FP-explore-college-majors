8269013,4,B0018AOMXW,"I'm enjoying this show, but some of the plots are so sexist. It's strange to think that back in the 60s it was considered amusing for a military officer to l lay bets on getting a woman drunk and having his way with her or for that woman to pretend to drink a dozen martinis to trick him and then end up dating him anyway. The plot of episode 20 (Love Thy Neighbor) is really creepy and anxiety producing with Doris basically being held against her will and chased around a barn by a  hillbilly trying to force himself on her. Then she ties two horses to the back of her jeep and takes off into the darkness at a fast clip. Really terrible behavior all around, but the laugh track just keeps on. Those two episodes are really sort of alarming, but overall, the show is fun and light. However, that's just in the first season! Who knows what will happen next? I understand that eventually she bugs out to San Francisco and forgets all about her family, which is also very weird. Que Sera, Sera!",1523836800,,993,4.310160427807487
8269014,5,B0018AOMXW,"This is a feel-good show full of models on how to treat one another respectfully and to be encouraging.  In the episodes I have seen, even though the cast was mostly white, the lesson was one of inclusion. This is rare form considering the era of the Doris Day Show.  I can't watch many of my old favorites now because of the gross racism, orientalism, and sexism that are prevalent from that day.",1520899200,,397,4.424657534246576
8269015,3,B0018AOMXW,"Good intro to the Doris Day show.  Just a heads-up to anyone buying this - it is ONLY DISC 1 of SEASON 1, not the entire season.",1514246400,,128,3.740740740740741

8269019,4,B0018AOMXW,"I love Doris Day, but this was not was I was expecting. I love the song ""Que Serra Serra"".-I've  changed my review and bumped up a star. Actually, I thought this was the entire series, it is not!! Please note, this is the same cover as the entire season, but only contains 1 disk, and only a few episodes from season 1. At the time I ordered it, I didn't notice this, and now really appreciate this show, and want more!! I'm thinking this was an error on my part, when I ordered it, as it is much too late to send it back, and re-order the FULL Season 1, which this is not. :(
I have now just ordered the full set, which will cost less then this one, but will say, I like the element of this season, with her kids and father. Also the beginning of the show, with the song, the images are so beautiful, with the kissing noses, sunset, flowers and butterfly's really showed high quality cinematography, for the time, and really draws the viewer in. These shows I'd say are family friendly, do have a point, and a moral, and I thought some fantastic talent, with the entire production, script-,acting, lighting, and music, old school songs, that I haven't heard in years! I look forward to the entire season 1!! Though after reading the reviews on the seasons after, their were a lot of changes with the show, but wonder if they made those changes, because of the times were changing. Doris Day was one of my most favorite actresses and singers!! Since I was a child !! :)",1495411200,,1469,4.341818181818182

8269021,5,B0018AOMXW,My parents like watching Doris Day shows and movies. From watching this show I remember how women were discriminated against in the workplace and how women had to fight for fair treatment and not as objects.,1431734400,,207,4.777777777777778
