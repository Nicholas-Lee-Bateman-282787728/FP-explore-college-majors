3058934,5,B00113ALMW,"We got this from the library because my daughter loves the stories ""Good Night Gorilla"" and ""Happy Birthday Moon"". These stories are well done, however I am most impressed with ""Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin"" because it goes beyond reading the story and showing the words. As each instrument is introduced, a short segment is played by that instrument, and then a piece with the instruments together. If I were just reading the book to my daughter, she would not have the benefit of hearing the music. She is very interested in listening to the sounds, and dances to the music at the end. If you are interested in teaching your child about music, I strongly recommend this video book collection.",1281484800,,689,4.702479338842975
3058935,5,B00113ALMW,This is good for before bedtime it settles my kids down and off to bed with sweet dreams in there heads.,1274054400,,104,4.0

3058937,5,B00113ALMW,"My daughter, who is two, loves this DVD more than any other video she has seen.  In fact, she loves it so much that it has become part of the goodnight routine--we read books, and, with the promise of this dvd, she happily lets me brush her teeth before we sit down and watch it together.  It's sweet, relaxing, and really like being read some good bedtime stories, with some complementary music and a bit of animation.  Her favorites from this DVD are Goodnight Gorilla, How do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight, Happy Birthday Moon, and The Napping House (the first four stories).  All of the animation is delightful, the stories are sweet, and these are far from the annoying, over-stimulating television that is often aimed at children.  We often read the books beforehand, and then watch the video.  Highly recommended.",1242259200,17,814,4.820143884892087
3058938,5,B00113ALMW,"We have a huge stack of bedtime books that we alternate at night, but when i saw this, we had to try it. My son is 19 months old and LOVES ""goodnight gorilla"" and ""happy birthday moon."" He always says ""happy happy happy"" at bedtime...and when he wants Goodnight Gorilla he goes ""zoooo"" - it is so cute. Both of them are absolutely a delight to watch. They are animated enough to bring the stories to life but not fast paced enough to excite your child at night. The music is gorgeous and relaxing, and honestly, i've fallen asleep watching them with him. We have the books as well and sometimes alternate between reading the stories and watching the dvd. If you have a child who is a little tired of your bedtime routine or w/ the same old books, try adding this dvd into the mix and you will have a very enticing bedtime routine!",1241740800,7,830,4.326923076923077

3058940,5,B00113ALMW,"Good Night Gorilla is the headliner for this DVD collection, but the 'more stories' are also very nice. The book itself is an instant favorite, right up there with GOOD NIGHT MOON. While reading to a child yourself is always preferable, it is not always possible, and this DVD fills in very nicely. Highly recommended for  children 2-7, although older children might enjoy it as well.",1230163200,,384,4.818181818181818
3058941,5,B00113ALMW,We have both the book and the video in this scholastic favorite. We recommend both. Our daughter follows along with her book as she watches her video. Goodnight Gorilla is a modern day classic that everychild must own. It is simple enough for a 2 year old to follow. But my child just keeps watching it. The other videos on the collection are also fun. But it is hard to beat Good Night Gorilla.,1227398400,6,395,4.351351351351352
3058942,5,B00113ALMW,"Our son loves the Good Night Gorilla and Napping House stories on this DVD. Beautifully animated and set to lovely, relaxing music. Perfect for when he is tired to help settle him down.",1387756800,,185,4.636363636363637
3058943,4,B00113ALMW,"Got this for my almost 3 yr old boy who loves napping house, goodnight gorilla and how do dinosaurs say goodnight.... When I saw that this had 3of his favorite books i had to get it. My son likes the happy birthday moon too now after watching this though I have never read the book to him. He is always asking for this DVD.... Saves me the hassle of reading a ton of books at bedtime... I just let him watch the 4 stories and read a few books and we are done :). I feel that napping house wasn't done as well as other stories...there was no animation at all just close ups of the pages of the books. Had they done it with some animation like the other stories it would have been much more enjoyable .... All other stories get 5 stars and napping house gets one star. Highly recommend",1386979200,2,783,4.124183006535947
3058944,5,B00113ALMW,"Great videos.  Don't think it really helps in putting the kids to sleep but it is calming.  Would recommend.  The second video, 'How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight' is so well done.",1384387200,,177,4.645161290322581

3058946,5,B00113ALMW,"The gorilla is my favorite.  It has one beautiful story called the Rainbabies that is just lovely, but may be a bit intense for a very young (2-3 year old) child. It is a beautiful story that I hope you likes when he is older.  There area few scenes when the babies are in danger by fire, swept to sea and that worried my son more than I thought it would.  Tha being said, I love this DVD and recommend it.",1373068800,,406,3.9876543209876543
3058947,5,B00113ALMW,Bought this as a replacement for a DVD that one of my daughters broke from a bigger treasury we have. All of the DVDs are wonderful retellings of classic storybooks. We watch them again and again.,1373068800,,196,4.472222222222222
3058948,5,B00113ALMW,My children watch this before bed on nights when I don't read to them. It has great stories and gets them in the mood for sleep. It's nice to have a kids DVD that doesn't contain any questionable material. Now days that seems to get harder and harder to find.,1370390400,,259,4.2
3058949,4,B00113ALMW,Story was very cute with the nice color matches for keys. Granddaugther likes calm animals. would have liked more interaction with zoo keeper and his charges. Overall nice.,1369180800,,172,5.178571428571429
3058950,5,B00113ALMW,we read this book before nighttime. I think it's okay. we got this as well as good night moon. 2 years old son likes Good night moon more.,1364947200,,138,3.9642857142857144
3058951,5,B00113ALMW,the dvd was new and reviews by the 5 year old twin grandsons is A+100.  sound and illustrations excellent from my viewpoint. wonderful childrens' stories enjoyed by all who view.,1360281600,,178,4.933333333333334
3058952,5,B00113ALMW,We got this for Goodnight Gorilla alone. Some of the other stories are a little weird but my kids love them.,1360022400,,108,4.190476190476191
3058953,5,B00113ALMW,"Thought I'd give this a try & was so happy to see it was worth the purchase.  We've been reading this story to my almost 2 year old daily for quite sometime and he was so happy to see the story come to life.  We now sit together flip through the book while watching the DVD, so he can match the pictures, etc.  The music is soothing for nap/bedtime & pics are soft on eyes.  DVD also has extra stories my son has favorited such as ""Happy Birthday Moon"".",1356480000,,453,4.056179775280899
3058954,5,B00113ALMW,"With the  background music a quiet ""Lullaby"" and the graphics and video so colorful and imaginative, this is a captivating video for children from 6 months on.  It's a great ""go to bed"" story and also fun for daytime as well.  I think this should be in the top 10 of any parent's stories.",1354579200,,288,4.296296296296297
3058955,5,B00113ALMW,"My 6 month old son, my husband and I all enjoyed Good Night Gorilla, cute story. Now at seven months my son seems to prefer the happy birthday moon story a little more, another good one by our review. Both of them get my son to relax and settle down for bedtime, sometimes he even falls asleep while watching them. NOTE TO PARENT- They will make you drowsy too ( :",1348185600,,364,4.140845070422535

3058957,3,B00113ALMW,I bought this for goodnight gorilla which i was happy with but it comes with other books some of which I don't think I'd want the print version of and are radically different in plotline sophistication over goodnight gorilla. these should be bundled with age appropriateness.,1324080000,,275,5.0
3058958,5,B00113ALMW,"Goodnight Gorilla may not have words with it, but the pictures say it all. What a great story to end the night with. This collection is full of fun. It's hard to get the Zin Zin Zin reading out of your head once you've watched it. : )",1319414400,,234,3.8958333333333335
3058959,5,B00113ALMW,"I purchased this DVD because ""Good Night Gorilla"" is the book my 20 month old granddaughter has chosen before bedtime for almost a year now.

3058961,5,B00113ALMW,"My son really likes this DVD and keep watching it since we got it 1 month before. He imitate' all actions as the Gorilla does and marches when all animals are going back to zoo. This story does not have many words, but only ""Good Night"", so children are easy to understand the contents. Also, he likes ""ZIN ZIN ZIN"", and keeps saying the rhythmical word ""ZIN ZIN ZIN"".

8240099,5,B00113ALMW,"This is actually our second Good Night Gorilla DVD. The first one got stepped on by my beefy toddler and we immediately ordered another because we all LOVE it. I don't like fast, obnoxious kids movies/tv shows. I really like Scholastic story book movies because they are slower, more deliberate, and this particular movie shows the words at the bottom of the screen. The animation is perfect for our toddler and the stories are sweet. We all watch them together before bed and it is a good calm down time.",1427328000,,505,4.622222222222222
8240100,5,B00113ALMW,"We purchased this DVD after viewing Good Night Gorilla on youtube, and it was certainly worth the investment. My boy (24 mos) loves the stories. Good Night Gorilla is very well done with animation that matches the book precisely. Because of the read-along option this DVD provides, the stories become as educational as they are entertaining. My boy's new favorite book is Happy Birthday Moon after viewing it on this DVD. The narrations are well done and true to the story. The last few stories aren't quite as interesting in my opinion, but I still like them.",1402876800,,560,4.783505154639175
