and then came this!

they are TALKING.

standing alone on stage, explaining how falling in love with each other could happen. it's more like a chorus line"" whitout the singing. i'm impressed. of course there are the interacting parts between the two women, where the expexted stuff"" happens. but making this movie this way, like an intimate play, is a big idea.

maybe i like it because i listen closer to the silent stories, maybe it's because it leads me to sit in front of the screen with this really gay smile on my face. whatever it is, you will be silly if you expect that you can buy this dvd second hand from me! forget it!!

2313300,2,B0009Q0EMY,"This is an okay movie, but it's more like a play. The girls are basically telling the story of how they came to be. The girls aren't very hot in the movie either. I wouldn't buy this movie at least not new anyway.",1126310400,2,213,3.9767441860465116
2313301,3,B0009Q0EMY,"Cinema is a medium that usually focuses on an unbroken chain of images that often are split up into a number of scenes. A series of continuous images creates movement of some kind and strengthens the appealing factor of a scene. Yet, much of what is within the scenes remains stationary, while the audience often finds their attention being attracted to what is in motion. Additional texture often emerges through the fusion of image and sound, as the sound consists of music, dialogue, and sometimes both. Thus, cinema presents a unique opportunity beyond art, music, literature, theater, and dance, as it can combine two or more facets of life and the arts into a thoroughly absorbing experience. However, on occasion some films forget to utilize the exceptional ability of cinema, which leaves the audience with an inorganic cinematic experience.

Girl Play presents an intriguingly witty and warm story that is based on the play Real Girls by Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon who also play themselves in the film. The film opens with monologues alternating between Robin and Lacie who begin to debrief the audience about their background to how they fell in love. Robin has settled down with a woman while the free spirited Lacie seeks new challenges out of life on a daily basis. Their monologues narrate how they met and how their careers brought them together. They also disclose how their situations with parents, vocations, and social lives are affected by their love.

The monologues in the film are performed in front of what seems to be a small standup stage and the stage crew has decorated the background in order to give the milieu a little depth besides the brick wall behind. Frequently, the monologues are interjected with scenes that depict what Robin and Lacie experienced on their route to this point in their lives. Occasionally, the director Lee Friedlander attempts to utilize more creative cinematography such as creating a black and white scene and the split screen scenes to break up the monotony of the monologues. Despite these extravagant efforts to make the film more appealing Friedlander fails to do so. It is sad to see how the monologues overwhelming length neglects to employ the ability of cinema, which could tie together several aspects of the story in a different light. Instead Girl Play creates a distance between the screen and the audience through the lengthy monologues, which only makes the few cinematic touches feel awkward and out of place. This is truly unfortunate as the story had great potential on both a comic and dramatic level, which probably will cause some viewers to end the cinematic experience before the ending.",1125100800,9,2674,4.993273542600897

2313317,4,B0009Q0EMY,"****

I enjoyed this film. It is definitely not a ""typical lesbian film"". Instead, it is like a play at a theater that is brought to film with the best of the theatrical show interspersed with fine film.

It is the true story of two comedians who decide to do a play together and fall in love. The story is narrated by the real two women standing on a stage telling the story of their relationship. Their narration is interrupted by a sort of reenactment of what they are telling you about, starring them but including actors playing the other parts. It is a creative and entertaining way to do a film.

The movie explores universal themes, not even primarily lesbian themes---things like falling in love with someone else when you're in a committed relationship, how it feels to be unable to resurrect a dead relationship, how it feels to try to make love to someone you are committed to but whom you have drifted far away from.

I loved it. I thought it was intelligently done, well-written, and that the acting was great. I even watched the special feature describing the making of the film.

This is definitely a film for adults. Teens (even older teens, in my opinion) and children would not understand the complex issues involved and would not be entertained; also there are some explicit lesbian love-making scenes.

Definitely recommended.

2313321,1,B0009Q0EMY,"I bought this DVD after reading a review in Diva magazine which describes it as 'Witty and vivacious' or something similiar. I have to say that it is the biggest load of drivel it has ever been my misfortune to watch. It is in equal measures, irritating, unappealing, self-indulgent,unintelligent and DULL. It is the story of two women, the two main actors, and how they got together, told by them in pseudo theatrical, and intensely annoying monologues, interspersed with ridiculously voyeuristic sex scenes that are about as titillating as cold pizza.

Everyone was well cast. It is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo-film cliche. It transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it's a ""gay"" movie.

2313325,5,B0009Q0EMY,"I really enjoyed the way the director incorporated the play, which the movie was based on, into the movie. The acting was great, and the love story was touching. I loved to see a real life lesbian couple playing the roles based on a real life account of their own story. Dom Deluise and Mink Stole were hilarious, and I highly recommend this movie.",1156550400,3,348,4.453125
2313326,1,B0009Q0EMY,"Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and ""sparks fly.""  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.

From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues?

In point of fact, however, the single attempt at ""comedy"" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.

The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the ""actresses"" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.

About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.",1156291200,14,2484,5.1546134663341645
2313327,2,B0009Q0EMY,"""Incredible"" I saw one review describing this production.  The meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is NOT incredible.  It is slow, convoluted and uninspired.  No chemistry exists between the actresses, with no connection to the audience, and the diologue was disjointed.
If you want to see brilliant women acting on a stage, rent or buy ANYTHING by Kathy Najimi and Mo Gaffney.",1153440000,8,415,4.9855072463768115
2313328,5,B0009Q0EMY,"I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The layered reality (writers playing writers playing actors playing themselves) keeps you on your toes. The cinematic device of organic storytelling is enhanced  by cutaways in both time and space to scenes of what we are to assume is each character's present reality outside the theater at the time when the story takes place back to the image of the storytellers in a narrative about these events that have already taken place, and again out to their experience coming to knowone another under Dom DeLuise's direction in the same theater (in the past). Really, it's an interesting device.

Production values are high and this film is pretty funny. . .and sexy. . .and revealing. While I  wouldn't necessarily  call it cinematic genius, gay movies dealing with any kind of plot beyond coming out are few and far between. This film is very much about relationships-how they fall apart and how they are born. The fact that these are lesbian relationships is just the cherry.",1151625600,8,1007,4.871345029239766
2313329,1,B0009Q0EMY,"I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible.

I saw it on Logo, and it did not sustain my interest for more than ten minutes.  First of all, the acting is beyond poor.

2313336,1,B0009Q0EMY,Plot mixes up real life of the characters and their activities in a play where they play at being lesbians. So many scenes are repetitive and the fast forward button is often needed,1140220800,4,181,4.515151515151516
2313337,5,B0009Q0EMY,"This is the story about two women (Robin Greenspan & Lacie Harmon) who portray themselves in the tale of how they came to be together.  It is a rather unusual film in that it's narrated by both of them.  I felt as though I was in a ""conversation"" with them during the course of the movie.

Robin & Lacie are both attractive, but neither are remotely close to being a Supermodel.  Somewhat surprisingly, despite that point, this movie is still one of the most salacious flicks I've ever seen. It had a unique honesty & openness about it that I found to be rather refreshing.

People who are looking for a soft-core porn movie that uses the lesbian angle as an excuse for a plot MAY be disappointed in this movie.  This story has a lot more substance to it than what I imagined, and it's quite a well done piece.

In the end, it covers the question of commitment vs. being with the person you want to be with.  There are two extremes.  On the one hand, some people expect absolute perfection & will accept nothing less.  On the other hand, there are people who are willing to ""settle for"" someone who does not check-off very many aspects that they're looking for on their personality wish-list.

Somewhere in the middle is where we should be.  This applies to all of us, whether we're gay or straight.  Life can be very difficult sometimes, and it becomes obvious that it is a myth that lesbians somehow have it ""easier"" than straight women.

If you're looking for a different sort of movie, this one just might be for you.  It offers humor, honesty and frankness blended together with eroticism for a winning story.  If ever there was a movie about lesbians that could actually pass as a date movie (regardless of the genders of the two people), this is it!!",1138492800,72,1757,4.477987421383648

Well, these chicks are real and this is their story, I'm personally glad there weren't many sex scenes (watching lesbian sex on TV just irritates me b/c they always look phony--although these are real lesbians, so who knows), and it IS a play!  Yes, I was pretty unprepared for the staight on monologing but I got interested in how their story was going to play out and the ending--the fact that these two girls are telling their own story--was worth it.

Not only that, the leading actors, Robin Greenspan & Lacie Harmon are completely compelling, believable, and ultimately true to themselves, given that it is their own relationship suddenly on view to the entire world.

I am saddened by the negative feedback given by some reviewers, but I would say, please do not let this put you off from buying this dvd - it is a work of art, and gives an emotional insight into real relationships, that is sadly lacking in most movies of our time.

Not to mention the humour - particularly with the director of the play, excellently acted by Dom Deluise, and, without fault, the wonderful Mink Stole, who plays Robin's mother.

Finally, the casting, acting, and producing are all spot-on, and I cannot praise this film highly enough. As is said by those who worked on this film (in the extras) it is a universal film about love, whether you are gay or heterosexual, everyone will identify with Girl Play because it is ultimately about love, and love alone.

2313342,3,B0009Q0EMY,"Not exactly what I expected, however it was still a good flick. I think it would probably be better played out on a stage, with the dialog and all, but overall a decent film.",1128211200,2,174,4.147058823529412
2313343,4,B0009Q0EMY,"Is it possible?  A gay-themed movie with intelligent dialogue and a realistic plot?  The only expectation I had coming into this film was that it would be like most of the other lesbian movies out there -- badly acted, poorly written and over-the-top with supposedly funny stereotypes.  What a pleasant surprise to see a movie that finally deals with a topic other than coming out.  The two leads were real women and adept actors, so there was an ease to them that's often lacking in independent films.

I've always enjoyed films adapted from plays because the dialogue tends to be much better, even if the scenes can be sparse, so I didn't mind that the characters addressed the camera frequently.  This wasn't so much a moving erotic drama as it was an insight into the minds and lives of mature women (and by mature I mean well developed, not old.)  I like erotic dramas, but it's also nice to explore the minds of gay characters once in a while.

I found this movie funny, intelligent and perceptive.  If there was a weakness, it was the usually funny Dom Deluise, who gives us another example of why straight actors should probably never play gay characters.

If you're looking for a film that's more angst than sex, more intelligence than melodrama, more real life humor than easy laughs, then you might really enjoy Girl Talk.",1127692800,13,1333,4.682403433476395
2313344,5,B0009Q0EMY,"First of all this is a true story about two woman who fall in love.  They didn't plan on it, nor did they ask for it, it just happened, which makes this such a great movie.  One woman Robin, is in a long term relationship, not the best of relationships but one that she is committed to. She has it all, the townhome, a dog cat and favorites restaurants they frequent.  Lacie on the other hand, is single, and has her own issues with relationships and least of all wants to get involved with a married woman.

These two woman tell the story of how they fell in love and why.  It was very nicely written, and I think that most lesbian or straight people can relate to things that they either went through or how they felt.

Keep in mind that these woman are not just acting, they are relating what actually happened to them, and who better to play them than themselves.  I laughed, remembered how things happened in my life that were similar.  I related to them and their circumstances.  Excellent movie, a must have to add to your personal collection! The extra scenes on the making of the film are enlightening, in fact it was the reason I had to watch it twice.",1127606400,12,1162,4.317972350230415
2313345,1,B0009Q0EMY,"I had such high hopes for this film and was sorely disappointed by it!!

To start off, I didn't like the two leading ladies, who play two gay woman who earn parts in a play. In this play, directed by Dom DeLuise, they are supposed to play lovers. From the get go the two women are attracted to each other and one ends up dumping her long time girlfriend for the other woman.

I thought this movie, which is really a play that is filmed, with LOTS of scenes with one the two lead actresses monologuing directly to the camera, was contrived, poorly written, unsexy, and boring.  I was didn't think either of the actresses was portrayed as a likable or interesting person.

Frankly I could hardly wait until was finished and was seriously angry that I paid over $20 for this movie!!! I give this film the lowest rating I can, which is a zero, which Amazon won't let me do. DON'T BUY THIS FILM!!!!

If you still want to see it, buy mine!",1127433600,8,933,4.308571428571429

This is, in my opinion, the worst lesbian dvd I've watched (and I've seen Family Affair and Late Bloomers, this is FAR worse).  Mink Stole was the only bright spot, she did a lovely job.  Dom DeLuise wasn't bad but was totally over the top and out of place in this video.  I'd just save myself the trouble, steer clear of this one and keep looking.",1230768000,,445,4.188235294117647
