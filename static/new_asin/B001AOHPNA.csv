3646413,5,B001AOHPNA,"Brilliant, wonderful and quite splendid. The 'Carry On' comedy film series (and this is only a small slice) is a part of British cinematic film history. If you are in need of anti-political-correctness medication, then self prescribe yourself a dose of these movies. This is proof why the British (and Irish) have the best sense of humor in the entire universe.",1438819200,,361,4.934426229508197

3646415,3,B001AOHPNA,Only 5 of the films are anamorphic and the rest are 4x3 letterboxed. Major disappointment as the original Anchor Bay set was all 16x9. Picture quality is good otherwise.,1422230400,4,169,4.862068965517241
3646416,5,B001AOHPNA,"This collection of movies would never have been made now.  It is hilariously sexist slapstick comedy at its best.
It is also quite satirical.  Who would have guessed that India had been conquered because a regiment of
Scottish soldiers did not wear underpants?",1421712000,2,260,5.023255813953488
3646417,5,B001AOHPNA,Haven't seen some of these movies more over 30 years. I loved their comedy then and still love it now,1386460800,2,101,4.1

8310297,4,B001AOHPNA,"Kenneth Williams' antics are always a pleasure to watch, no matter how many times you may have seen a particular movie of his.  Although I had seen most of the ""Carry On.."" series years ago on the big screen, I felt I needed to have the collection on DVDs, just as I had them on VHS in the 1990's.",1498348800,,297,4.033898305084746

8310301,3,B001AOHPNA,"I purchased this for my husband, who by the way is from England, was very excited for the gift.  We started watching them and got through disk one with no problem but when we started disk 2 it would not play. The disk looks like there is a line right through it and not a scratch but a disk flaw that was there when the disk was made and not caught in quality control.",1459382400,2,368,3.972972972972973

8310304,5,B001AOHPNA,Some of the best of the British carry-on films. These are much funnier than the carry-on tv specials and tv series. They hold up as well or better than Monty Python.,1451952000,,165,4.354838709677419
