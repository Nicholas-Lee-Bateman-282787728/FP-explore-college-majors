So many movies are so predictible you can figure out the end from the begining, but not this one that involves divorce, corporate politics, romance, cheating women, the South American jungle and crime all in one short package. Yes, you can tell its' all going to work out well in the end for the lead actor, since this is a Hollywood film, but I dare you to figure out how it will be OK before the movie reveals itself. I also liked  the idea of a guy giving up a corporate job to shovel coal because his woman did  him wrong.",1148428800,3,641,4.079365079365079
