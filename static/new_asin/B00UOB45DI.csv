7064389,5,B00UOB45DI,"As we learn at the beginning of this 91 minute documentary - another fine release from the Cohen Media Group - in 1931 there were 1,500 Jewish deli's in the five boroughs of NY. In 2014 there  are just 150 such delis in the WHOLE United states. And, unlike what you'd expect - at least I did - many currently operating delis (nearly all run by 2nd or 3rd generation ""deli men"" (though there is one ""deli woman"") are NOT in NY. They are Chicago, Houston, Toronto, San Francisco and Boca Raton, FL

Most of the story is told by visits to, and interviews with, various deli owners. The one who gets the most screen time - and is one of the most interesting - is Ziggy Gruber from Houston, TX. There is also a side-story about Ziggy's love life that is fun to follow.

There are a few ""deli celebrities here"" Larry King and Jerry Stiller.

If you aren't hungry by the time you start watching this, you will be by the end. You'll learn a lot of ""deli lore"" (who created the first ""huge sandwich""?).
There are 40 minutes of interview outtakes, some comments from deli-maven Allan Dershowitz and a visit to the famous ACME Smoked Fish company. Nearly an hour of extra material which is not on the Streaming Amazon Instant version.

I guess at points, I felt the film got repetitive but I did enjoy it all the way through and glad I did get to see it.

Like most other Cohen  releases this includes a color 8-page booklet . This time it is  mostly photos plus a few production credits. No essay or other text.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7064413,5,B00UOB45DI,"Extremely well done. I almost didn't watch it, because I wondered how interesting could a film about delis actually be? Real people doing a really tough job and celebrating their culture. Awesome. The film does an outstanding job capturing the passion of the ""deli men."" The film is mostly endearing because it reflects traditional American (and Jewish) values that have been lost; hard work, long hours, sacrifice, family, quality, and pride.",1494460800,,443,5.253521126760563

7064415,5,B00UOB45DI,"If you like  (love) Jewish delicatessen,  this is the movie for you. It also has a nice romantic side plot. It documents the rise, and alas the decline of the Jewish delicatessen restaurant. Highly recommended for pastrami sandwich lovers. A warning - it should come with a gift certificate for a visit to your cardiologist.",1491436800,,324,4.872727272727273
7064416,4,B00UOB45DI,"""Deli Man"" or ""Deli Men""?  The documentary features around a dozen or so third generation+ family guys, but one is prominently featured enough to claim the title ""Deli Man"".  That is Mr. ""Ziggy"" Gruber, who while he can't be called ""The Confuscious of Corned Beef"" (that name was already taken), he has got to be the closest equivalent to the ""soup nazi"" from Seinfeld you have ever seen.  He KNOWS how to cook this food correctly, and while he is much more amicable than the soup nazi he is never-the-less driven by the same pure perfection.  A sentimental man with a passion for the past, he is part of a great story to be told that can make you happy and sad at the same time.

This documentary tries to be many things, and succeeds for the most part in all of them.  The history and origins of the American deli (actually German), the story of eastern european immigrants, jewish culture, the importance of food and family.  Ziggy gets the star treatment here, but you also get the sense that all the ""deli operators"" have equally good stories to tell and all share the same dedication. Grateful men and women who love food yes, and love to make money (or at least try), but first and foremost lovers of their communities who contribute to where they live through their restaurants.

That love is shared back by well known comedians such as Jerry Stiller and Feyvush Finkel, who give cameo commentary alongside other past New York stars on the historical importance of these delis.  4 1/2 stars only because it was a tad long and ever so slightly indulgent.  Like any true deli customer, you have to find something to complain about, right? Until the deli goes out of business one day and you realize no manner of a McDonaldized America can replace them.  Long live the deli!",1486944000,,1779,4.580441640378549

If you need to put some weight on then just sit down and spend a delightful time watching.

I introduced my Filipina wife and her sons to deli food and they were instant fans. When my stepson goes into our local deli, all the guys behind the counter recognize him, greet him warmly, ask him if he wants ""the usual"" and send him on his way with warm wishes. It reminds me of how Jews brought so much good will to America and how grateful I am to have enjoyed it.

I hope this tradition continues.",1485561600,2,649,4.355371900826446

7064484,5,B00UOB45DI,"LOVED IT!

I'm a Gentile with some distant Jewish family history, enough to make me love the culture but be unfamiliar at a young age.

I made many Jewish friends in college in Southern California, and I was introduced to their beautiful families and the joy of a good nosh.

This was a great reminder to me of places like Greenblatt's in LA, another gem in San Fernando Valley I cant recall the name of but adored their food...and a homestyle place in San Diego known as DZ Akins.

It was a fun ride to visit all these historic delis and meet the families and offspring that have kept some alive and well.  Quite a testament to celebrating one's heritage.

7064512,5,B00UOB45DI,"What a great entrance!  Setting the tone is a lively Klezmer track, accompanying the crack-of-dawn delivery trucks at Kenny and Ziggy's Deli in Houston. Ziggy Gruber is a 3rd generation deli man, who began to learn his trade at 8, at the side of his beloved grandfather. So attached to him was Ziggy, that even his speech and cadence are more reminiscent of that generation than his own. He brings a heap of personality to the piece, as does the storytelling of many old-timers, including Jerry Stiller, Lary King, and Fyvush Finkel. The role of the deli and its interface with the Jewish population in religious and cultural events, across the life cycle, is impressive. But few delis have survived shifting demographics and extreme rises in cost of products and leases. Started by early Jewish immigrants who arrived with little more than the delicious recipes of their families and ancestors, kosher delis in 1931 numbered 1500, just in New York's 5 burroughs. Today there are 150 nationwide. So the deli man, for the love of it, perseveres in this physically, emotionally, and financially challenging environment. The food shots might stimulate a little drooling or growling. Winningly directed by Erik Anjou, with solid filming by David Sperling, and fine editing by Lisa Pallatella, this is a worthy one-- for Jews, and non-jews, and enthusiastic fans of culinary and cultural history.

If I had a car I could probably drive to a couple of places where I still might find the food that is such a treat for me.

I would have given it a 5, but I'm not sure it would be as meaningful to someone unfamiliar with true delis, where everything is made right there.

Chronicles the rise and fall of the Jewish Deli in America (and Canada), and profiles the intrepid ""Deli Men"" (and Women) who continue to break their kishkes to keep the tradition alive. Aside from the amazing food shown, you also get a feel for how the Jewish Deli and its food is an important part of American Jewish history and culture.

As explained in the film btw, the claim is that these establishments were the first ""fast food"" facilities in America.  Huge Pastrami Sandwiches, so also maybe the origin of our wide girth present population ?  Anyway, enough of snarky.

7064891,3,B00UOB45DI,"This mostly a vanity piece about Ziggy Gruber shot by his brother. The shots of food are gorgeous and the interviews with other Deli Men are interesting, as is some of the histories of Delis. That said, Ziggy is somewhat annoying, his personality said to be charming, to me seems very self centered. He loves to talk about how they (meaning his restaurant) does it right, while talking down about anyone who has tried to innovate or change. Keep in mind that Ziggy operates in Houston Texas a much less challenging location (lower taxes, fewer regulations, and less competition from other Jewish Delis) than New York or LA (where the other Deli's Featured are located). To be blunt Ziggy is obsessed with the past and  in some ways is a jerk about it, he wants to go to Europe (the Temple where his Grandfather attended) to be married so they do even though it's clear that their friends and family couldn't come, a thing his bride may have wanted. He also talks down about how some Jews are not Jewish enough for him, in part because they don't speak Yiddish, of course he goes out of his way to show off his Yiddish speaking. Brass tacks the best parts are those that don't have Ziggy, or are where Ziggy gets schooled by his Dad on the fact that things change no matter what you do.",1461715200,3,1285,4.468085106382978

There are only two Jewish delis in Houston. The Deli Man one one in the heart of the Houston Galleria, a big commercial complex to the west of the central city. The food is good, but pricey, compared to Katz's Deli, located in Neartown just west of downtown and within blocks of my home.
Katz's matzo ball soup in now up to $8 a bowl and their Broadway Breakfast has also doubled to $9. It has four options to pick from, including potato pancakes, blintzes, hot corned beef and/or pastromi, and scrambled eggs with hot salami. Katz's is also run by the son of a NYC deli owner. I remember taking a deli vacation to NYC and eating at the three famous ones at Times Square. It was now owned and operated by mid easterners. No offence, the food was good, but it just isn't authentic without a Jewish owner.",1455580800,,961,4.374301675977653

7065221,4,B00UOB45DI,"An excellent film for both deli lovers and those that don't think about them much.  Director Erik Greenberg Anjou tracks the great winnowing of the classic Jewish delicatessen in America, from thousands of locations at the height of their popularity down to about 150 locations today.  Anjou gets nice little cameos from Jerry Stiller, Larry King, Alan Dershowitz and others (the great Fyvush Finkel is a standout).  The real standouts, however, are the deli owners themselves.  And, contrary to what you'd think, Anjou's leading man has set up shop in Houston, TX, not NYC.

Ziggy Gruber is a third-generation deli man and classically trained chef.  A native New Yorker, he landed in Houston.  He knows about delis and history.  He's the audience's guide and storyteller.  Without Ziggy, there's a far less interesting movie.

I liked that Anjou tried to focus on the newer generation of deli men.  Ziggy is a combination of the old and the new, but we also see the scions of the Canter deli in LA plus those trying to establish new traditions like Zane Caplansky with namesake Caplansky's in Toronto and Evan Bloom and Leo Beckerman, co-proprietors of Wise Sons in San Francisco",1449360000,,1180,4.939086294416244

I grew up in N.Y.C. so it was nostalgic to see some of the delis I had gone to as a youth, but I found myself drumming my fingers about halfway through this movie as it could have easily been edited to remove the circadian loops of deli facts as they got way too full of schmaltz for my taste.

That was interested.  When they start going into the life a deli owner, it became mundane.",1448150400,,262,4.48936170212766
7065373,3,B00UOB45DI,"Two movies. First 45 minutes - great. Next part of the film needs a major edit. It's almost like the outtakes from the first 45.

Brings back lots of memories and I can understand the affinity for the old guard, and their values BUT worship of tradition for traditions sake is useless. And Ziggy is a victim of that worship to some degree. But hard not to fall in love with his obsessiveness.

What the film does not delve into is the essence of what the Deli and its food and its success, best represents. And that is a multitude of things but one important component which is that while Jews were blocked through often unjust circumstances from becoming lawyers/doctors/professionals when first arriving in the US, they were able to take their genius and incredible abilities and apply them to food. And when you take a genius - such as Ziggy, and have that brain focused on pastrami instead of quantum physics - you get something incredible - to eat! Spitting in the face of the Nazis and the Communists that chased these people all over, and eventually out of Europe - making them an essential part of the American experience. And so I liked that comment about walking back to Hungary, although what a miserable f-ing scene in that synagogue with that god-awful music.

I will also say that more than Jewish culture, the film celebrates what it means to be a New Yorker - as evidenced from the difference we see in the Canadian and Californian Delis (those lame losers with the socks on their head - tempura batter kugel or something - give me a break). Italian, Irish, Greek, Black, German, etc. are all melting potted into the Deli experience. It is 100% American and should be celebrated by all people. And Ziggy needs to diet!",1448150400,,1734,4.605177993527508

7065452,5,B00UOB45DI,"For someone like me who grew up in Manhattan and was crazy about 2"" thick hot pastrami sandwiches, this was a wonderful trip down memory lane. One shouldn't watch this movie on an empty stomach. The deli guys were real characters -- menschen, actually. They love their work, the food, and their customers. Kosher deli is really Jewish soul food as the movie makes clear. South Beach diet, it aim't, but who can resist a hot bowl of matzoh ball soup and a corned beef on rye with those fat french fries? From a cardiac health standpoint, maybe it's good I do not live in a town with notable delis, but we occasionally visit New York. One stop is always a local kosher deli near my sister-in-law's house in Queens. ""Deli Man"" is the next best thing to being there.",1447286400,,762,4.45

As a kid growing up in Brooklyn, I can identify with the Kosher Deli.
The first Kosher Deli I was exposed to was in Brownsville section of Brooklyn.
It was back in the 1960s,and the Deli was located on the corner of Saratoga and Sutter ave.
I remember having the kosher hot dogs and the Knishes. It's sad to hear that there's not to many Deli's left ,in the New York City area.",1447113600,,415,4.333333333333333

7065494,5,B00UOB45DI,"I have to start out by saying I am biased.  I am Jewish and really enjoy reading about the lives of the immigrants who came to this country around the turn of the 20th century.  This documentary showed quite a lot about the history of that period through the telling of the story of the Jewish delicatessens.  Starting out as a place where the poor immigrants in New York could get a cheap meal of food they were comfortable with, the documentary showed the growth of the delis as the Jews started to become part of the main stream culture.
The delis they featured included several in New York City where I had eaten as well as Canter's in Los Angeles where I grew up.
I thought they did a good job of showing the rise (to over 1500 delis in New York city alone) to today's low of 150 in the entire country.
The comments from the older Jewish performers still around and the description of the stars whose pictures lined the walls of one of the famous delis added to my interest in the film.
As a history buff, I felt sorry for the people who gave this documentary low scores and said they were bored and watched only a few minutes of the film.  Knowing where many of our ancestors came from, the kind of environment they entered when they first arrived in the USA and how they eventually thrived should give us some idea of how our country became such a great melting pot.",1447027200,,1373,4.310077519379845

The essence of the film was captured in one scene where the main character, after getting married in eastern Europe (previous home of his departed grandparents), was asked if his grandparents came back what would he do. He replied that he was happy to complete one of life's many circles, that he loved them and misses them both very much, and then he pauses for a moment and finally asks for  his grandfather's gravy recipe that nobody can replicate and everyone loves. lol  Very funny and so New York.

7065638,4,B00UOB45DI,"I landed a job across the street from Carnegie Deli on Seventh Avenue, so I wanted to try out the famed deli that I had heard so much about throughout the years.

I had ordered at the counter a corned beef sandwich on rye and went to sit down. There were a few others already at the extended tables so I laid down my plate at an empty place and began to eat. Someone at the table, asked me to pass him the mustard. I did and replied ""you're welcome."" Before I knew it, I was surrounded  by tourists who wanted to see and talk to an original New Yorker, I grew up and lived in both the Bronx and Queens.

Before, I knew it, I had tourists to my left and to my right, all asking questions. To appease them, I switched over to my Robert DiNero, Woody Allen accent and talked jokingly to the tourists with my thick, Bronx nasal voice, playing the funny, tough guy. They were astounded, pleased, awed to be sitting next to a real New Yorker. I told them about living under the rumble of the Jerome Avenue line, and sloshing through the mud of Little Neck Bay.

When I finished eating and talking, I walked out of the deli, leaving the tourists wanting more. Upon feeling the fresh air, I went back to work.

I like New York delis. This show is the real deal, totally genuine. If one wanted to get an understanding of what makes New Yorkers tick, the Deli Man video is a good place to start. It describes the real New York. And best of all, what makes New York New York.

At the deli, I found out the tourists were from Houston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and other locations throughout the country, and they were eager to learn about NYC. If I only knew then what I know now, I would have suggested for them to look at the Deli Man video.",1446076800,9,1732,4.201807228915663

I love deli food, although living in the Dallas area there aren't a lot of choices - so I rarely eat it. I grew up on the east coast, and some of my best friends were Jewish, so I had a fair amount of exposure to deli food. This was really a nostalgic trip - not only recalling some of the food and some of the famous delis I've been to, but learning about the history of the deli in the US, and seeing its popularity waning - with a few notable exceptions. Funny, I have been to the deli in Houston, but it was totally random. I had a job interview there and a few hours to kill before my plane left, so I saw it on the street and walked in. It was great!

Anyway, I really enjoyed this - meeting the real-life ""deli men"" and seeing the recipes, traditions, etc. being passed on made this is worthwhile trip. It was funny, heartwarming, and a bit sad, too.",1445472000,,982,4.030769230769231

Stacked sandwiches, chicken soup, homemade pastrami, a longing look at the past and a realistic exploration of the present: it's all here in this movie, along with personal memories and humorous anecdotes.

Carnegie and Katz are overrated. Gets a little repetitive as if trying to get 90 minutes from a 60 minute story.

7065808,4,B00UOB45DI,"A fun film with a lot of schamltz. ""Deli Man"" is a documentary by Erik Anjou and Erik Greenburg on the history and current state of Jewish delicatessen food in the United States. The film mainly centers around deli owner and chef David ""Ziggy"" Gruber who's a second generation ""deli man."" Who doesn't love a pastrami or corned beef piled high on rye? From what were hundreds of Jewish delis in New York alone (back in the 30s through the 50s) only a handful survive today. And an even smaller amount throughout the U.S. You've probably heard of them: Nate and Al's, Carnegie Deli, Cantor's, Stage Door, 2nd Avenue...Manny's in Chicago.
It's a tough business: the deli restaurant biz. It's not heart healthy. It's not vegan (c'mon, let's hear it for corned tongue). It's salty. Fatty. Smoked.
Okay, I'm hungry already.
But it's tradition. Something in today's fad-conscious society that's becoming a rarity. And ""Ziggy"" is the keeper of the flame.
It's kind of like Borscht Belt humor and Vaudeville, it's pass&eacute; unless someone keeps it alive.
There's cameos by Larry King, Fyvush Finkel, Jerry Stiller, Freddie Roman and other Jewish comics. All lovers of deli food.
So grab a kosher dill, yellow mustard, and your favorite deli meat and savor the flavor. And may your matzos ball soup have plenty of chicken fat.",1444262400,,1319,4.892857142857143

7065810,5,B00UOB45DI,"Loved this!! I loved all the older comedians and others talking about their memories of Jewish delis. I'm Jewish (but don't have strong ties to my family) and a vegetarian (who doesn't miss meat at all), but I really enjoy learning anything about the Jewish culture and I especially love being around that type of food. I have very fond memories of eating kreplach, liverwurst, matzoh ball soup, lox & bagels, corned beef, etc. Going to Jewish delis really brings back some strong memories for me, which is exactly what this movie did, as well.

I agree with other reviewers that the movie was a little long and some may lose interest after about an hour, especially those who have no ties to the culture or this kind of food. But if you enjoy learning about the history of another culture's food and the history of a very unique institution such as the delicatessen (especially if you love deli food and/or have ever lived in New York), you will really enjoy this.",1444262400,,965,4.6104651162790695

7065836,5,B00UOB45DI,"First of all, I haven't had a decent pastrami sandwich in about 20 years.  That's what happens when one lives in Virginia, even though the Carnegie Deli did have an outpost there for a few years (the last time I HAD a good pastrami sandwich).  AND I pickle my own kirby cukes and green tomatoes since there is nothing like homemade for these kinds of delicacies.  In short, I had a great time watching all of the delicious food coming out of the various kitchens that were filmed.  Even stuffed breast of veal, which my mom made for my dad (when we were young) and I hated it.....
But I also have to say that Ziggy G is really amazing.  Who would have thought that a man 20 years my junior would act like somebody at least 15 years my senior???  But his dedication to the food and the experience is something that warmed my heart.  And it will probably do the same for those who love and remember what delis were like in the good old days (I even remember Ratners and Rapaports from childhood) and those who never had the pleasure.
Well made, affectionately done, and a real treat for the eyes and the heart.  I enjoyed it immensely--and yes, there are no delis in Rhode Island, WHATSOEVER!!!",1444176000,,1192,4.386363636363637

The film is also centered quite a bit around Jewish culture in America, and I was elated by the appearance of various aging actors and comedians who commented on their connection to Deli culture. I particularly enjoy shows about culture with a focus on foods, so for that reason I found the film enjoyable. But this is by no means a 'No Reservations' w/ Anthony Bourdain, or 'Bizarre Foods' w/ Andrew Zimmern. By the end of the film though I was craving a warm corned beef on rye, a hot bowl of matzah ball soup, and kreplach. Actually, I was craving these things by the middle of the film.

I discovered that the owners of a Jewish deli were unlike most restaurant owners in that, if you walked through their door more than once, you were now their family and they took care of you like family.  My roommate and I could bring in a store bought brisket and the owner would turn it into a corned beef or a pastrami for us to take home a couple days later, no charge.  I miss the Lincoln Del like I miss my own childhood home and every town I have lived in since, I would always find the best Jewish Deli and make it mine.  I now live in Los Angeles and my Deli is Brent's Delicatessen and Restaurant in Northridge, CA.  I like the documentary so much, but I had to remove one star because you did not include Brent's Deli in Northridge, CA!",1443484800,,908,4.078651685393258
7065930,4,B00UOB45DI,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I like deli food. At least the deli food Ive had the chance to come into contact with. But as the movie here explains the deli is a dying breed when it comes to restaurants in the country these days. That should make folks who love real delis or who watch this film bring a resurgence in trying to find these restaurants before they can fade away into being nothing more than a memory.

DELI MAN is a documentary that focuses on Ziggy Gruber, a co-owner of the biggest deli in Houston and grandson of one of the original big delis in New York years ago. Ziggy loves his business. He loves the tradition that hes carrying on. He loves the history of it all. And all of that shows not only in this film but in the business that he runs.

Keep in mind were not talking about that section of the grocery store that sells cold cuts and potato salad. Certainly their basis began with the real delis of old. What this movie is about are the outstanding delicatessens that have fallen by the wayside for the most part, dropping from the thousands to a mere handful in todays world of fast food menus. Delis of old created special sandwiches and carried items like matzo ball soup, served real meats that were cooked fresh and sliced to order and featured many kosher delicacies as well.

The movie might focus on Ziggy, coming back to him and his tale often but it also presents a pretty comprehensive history of the American deli at the same time. Through still of the past, old footage and interviews with deli customers and owners you get a timeline and a better understanding of what a deli actually was. It also makes you long for those delis to return in full force. Sure the local McD can make you a quick burger but the end product while passable will never have the same flavor of a corned beef on rye made on the spot rather than shipped frozen across country.

Watching this movie gave me hope. Its the same reason a show like DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES is so popular. People love food. But more than that they love real food at reasonable prices. They long for the places that used to dot the country from one end to the other, places that served fresh food to hungry customers, that recognized you when you walked in. Like to spots found on that series, delis offered the same thing.

Watching this movie you grow fond of Ziggy and want nothing but long lasting success for him and for his deli. You want him to find happiness and by the end it appears that he has. It will also make anyone who is able to do so want to take a trip to Houston just to stop in and sample what he offers. My guess is that those who are fortunate enough to do so will be glad they did. The movie presents an Oscar worth feature that covers the topic well and deserves notice.",1443484800,,2817,4.3156899810964084

You should get a thrill when you bite into a kosher hot dog, the skin offering just enough resistance to your teeth, the incredible burst of salty spicy juiciness when the skin yields. You must be an aficionado of the simple perfection of a pastrami on rye:  the pastrami slightly fatty, the crunchy crust of the rye bread playing against the softness of its interior, the sharpness of the mustard adding just the right exclamation point. If your mouth is watering at this point,  you will enjoy this story of a Deli Man in, of all places, Texas, well-seasoned with reminiscences from deli aficionados like Larry King and Jerry Stiller.",1442620800,,747,4.920634920634921

Their sandwiches (pastrami, corned beef) are superb, of course.  But, they do all kinds of interesting dishes that used to exist in eastern European cuisine but have disappeared among American Jewish families (like stuffed cabbage and Kishka).  They also have a lot of innovative dishes such as quinoa salad (very tasty, but not very Eastern European).

Anyway, the film is terrific and deals with the evolution and virtual disappearance of Jewish delis in the U.S.  Apparently, there are only about 150 left.  Plus, of all the owners interviewed in the film, only Ziggy, a couple from Canter's in Los Angeles, and a couple of guys from San Franciso are youngish.  Unfortunately, it's a dying cuisine that is starting to be taken over by chain restaurants.  Sad.  But, as the film points, unlike, say, Italian, Chinese or Mexican restaurants, there aren't any Jewish immigrant cohorts from Eastern Europe coming in to replenish the traditional cultural restaurants; they were either wiped out by the Nazis or left Eastern Europe long ago. Going to a deli has unfortunately become like going to a museum to see the past.

Catch this film.  It's a must-see.",1437782400,,1437,4.884297520661157

I loved the old photos, the various interviews, the humor, and - most of all - Ziggy Gruber (who is featured throughout much of the film).  Ziggy must surely be one of the most kind-hearted and thoughtful people in the deli universe.  There's a very special back story about his life, and I was literally in tears after watching the scenes filmed at his wedding.",1437350400,12,460,4.585365853658536

8707754,2,B00UOB45DI,"I am absolutely baffled by the glowing reviews. The deli shown is talked about like it's the greatest thing since buttered toast. It really just looks kind of average or maybe even below average. As stated in the movie, the number of delis has declined dramatically. There is a reason for that. I was appalled at how the owner walks around while people are eating, interrupts them, and pushes them to talk to him. I also did not think the food looked too great either. I got about half way before I could no longer tolerate the pretentiousness of the whole thing.",1495756800,,563,4.529411764705882
