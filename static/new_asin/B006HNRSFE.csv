4990517,5,B006HNRSFE,"""WOW what a great video set. I have several other videos by Manny and they are great so I knew when I saw this title was available I had to have it. Buy the set and you will turn your ordinary snapshots into photos with visual eloquence""",1328400000,,237,4.0638297872340425
4990518,5,B006HNRSFE,"Manny Pontoriero's latest instructional DVD set includes two DVDs that offer outstanding instruction in landscape photography.

As with Manny's earlier instructional DVDs, don't just watch a DVD once. Instead, watch a DVD, take a ton of pictures, and then watch the DVD again. Digital photography allows you to take many photos of a scene, from every angle, using different lenses and filters, with an immediate review of your efforts, and without the need for development as with film photography.

The first DVD includes multiple sessions with Manny offering classroom style instruction that includes drawings and samples of a topic. Then, it is out into the field to use those principles in action. It is in the first DVD that Manny also explains Parallel Thinking. Parallel Thinking is `how else can I photograph this scene'? Don't just take the one picture that you initially saw. Instead, what other options (different times of the day, different seasons, using different lenses, etc.) can you use to capture the scenes at a location?

The second DVD offers 14 sessions in the field at different landscape location along the East Coast. In each session, Manny offers detailed description of what he is doing at each location, along with why. Throughout those sessions are tidbits of information you might miss, yet are important. For example, if you are stacking filters on a lens use a step-up ring so you can use larger filters on a lens and not vignette your photo. Or, don't change lenses at the beach if the wind is blowing as you do not want to get sand grains into a lens or the camera; and, vacuum the lens and camera when back home to remove any sand grains on the outside surfaces.

The second DVD contains a bonus 15th session in which Manny moves from the camera to the computer to briefly explain what changes he might make to a specific photo. He uses the raw editor of Photoshop to make those adjustments, along with the neutral density adjustment available from that editor.

I highly recommend Manny's DVD sets, especially this two DVD landscape photography set.",1325376000,10,2085,4.878531073446328
4990519,5,B006HNRSFE,"I consider myself to be an amateur enthusiast photographer. This DVD set, like all of Manny's, are very informative. I enjoy his style of teaching and all the advice that he gives during the DVD. Landscape photography is one of my favorite styles to shoot. Once again Manny's many examples and differing locations made this DVD extremely educational. I have purchased all of Manny's Get the Picture DVDs and would highly recommend them. Thanks Manny!!!",1325289600,4,452,5.04
8498582,5,B006HNRSFE,"This is so useful.
The photographer here has obviously spent time teaching in front of an audience. His manner is engaging and easy to follow. His enthusiasm is contagious and it makes me want to run out try using some of his techniques right away.

Sometimes he will say something that sounds 'odd' such as 'The time is the place"" and then he will go on to explain what he means. It's a great way to draw me in to listen and these catch phrases are easy to remember and thus easy to apply out in the field.

I particularly liked that he backs up what he teaches with numerous examples. So he he might talk about 'the time is the place' and then he will demonstrate what he means by showing you several pictures taken at the same place but different times. Sometimes he goes out into the field and takes photos and using the 'Manny Cam"" you can actually see what he is doing. This is so useful because you can see how a photographer thinks and what he is looking for when he's looking at a scene.

I found that I would start and stop this as I took notes or re watched part of the video to really understand what he was saying.

Landscape photography is my hobby and something I enjoy. If you have been doing this a very long time like I have, then this might be a good refresher for you. If you are just getting into photography or have been away for a long time, this dvd will be really helpful.",1529280000,,1397,4.182156133828996

8498585,3,B006HNRSFE,I did like this.  The content was useful.  One disk was repetitive of his other photographer series.  The 2nd disk was useful for a novice like myself.  The 2nd disk contained recorded examples of techniques and composition styles to try in various conditions.  It would be helpful to first see all 3 of the photographer series first.,1396051200,,334,4.7894736842105265

Manny does a great job in showing the ins an outs of great landscape photography.
A must for enthusiast as well pros to refresh your memory.

8498589,5,B006HNRSFE,"Every one of Manny's DVD's is filled with so much valuable information on becoming a better photographer.  I started with Jump Start, then moved to The Skilled Photographer, followed by the Ultimate Photographer and also this fabulous DVD.  After spending a ton of money on books and never truly understanding what they were saying, these DVD's have made such a HUGE difference in my photography.",1359331200,2,396,5.076923076923077
8498590,4,B006HNRSFE,"I have been doing photography seriously for about 15 years and am currently president of a camera club.  I am always looking for material that will help the members of my club be better photographers. I bought this DVD with this in mind.  Watching the 2 DVDs I found that Manny has a very calm and patient demeanor in his teaching style. I often found myself smiling along with him while listening intently to what he has to say.  He emphasizes his points over and over again, so much so that at the end of watching his lessons you really do remember what he has said and come away with an earnest desire to go out and practice what he has been preaching. I must admit that I was not that impressed with some of Manny's photographs.  However, I always keep in mind that the judgement of any photograph is personal and very subjective. Anyone who has had their photographs judged in a camera club competition knows this only too well! In any case, I want to emphasize that the images are NOT the important thing to take away from these DVDs. The important thing is to listen to the content of his message and envision the impact of his techniques as they could apply to YOUR OWN photography.  I learned quite a few things from watching these DVD's and would recommend them to any amateur or advanced amateur photographer who wished to re-enforce their fundamental photographic techniques as well as find some new tricks to try out.  Finally, I hope that others will enjoy these DVD's as much as I did.",1353974400,5,1500,4.4963235294117645
8498591,5,B006HNRSFE,"Manny is an excellent instructor. I've been tinkering with photography since high school. Now, 50 years later, it's time to put down my typewriter and pick up my camera. Thank you Manny for the informative tips and excellent instruction. Now I can go from taking snapshots to creating photographs.",1339977600,5,297,5.081632653061225
