5927744,4,B00EMLRKIS,"'Enjoyed it.  It was fun, refreshing, relaxing, reminescent, ....  We watched it during Christmastime.  It was good entertaiment.  'Very good.",1388793600,4,142,5.95
5927745,2,B00EMLRKIS,"While the episodes are fun to watch, the picture quality is rather disappointing. Some episodes are very grainy, especially the Honeymooners. I have an old VHS tape of that episode that looks better than this DVD.",1388361600,,213,4.944444444444445
5927746,5,B00EMLRKIS,"If you like old shows with a holiday theme, then THIS is for you. If not, save your money !",1388275200,,91,3.6
5927747,5,B00EMLRKIS,I bought this as a pre-Christmas gift for my mom to enjoy during the holidays and she watches it everyday. I'm so happy I purchased this item and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the classic t.v. shows.,1387324800,3,211,4.3
5927748,5,B00EMLRKIS,"These are all fun slices of holiday cheer from a simpler time in television history.
The Honeymooners (live version from The Jackie Gleason Show) is the oldest
but always so funny. The Donna Reed Show is very sweet with an appearance
by Buster Keaton. Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies are fondly-
remembered favorites of the era while The Doris Day Show from 1970 is a
special treat - lots of wonderful TV actors such as McLean Stevenson, Rose Marie,
Bernie Kopell, Kaye Ballard, Denver Pyle and Billy DeWolfe supporting Doris,
who also sings a wonderful Christmas song before stepping out of character
and wishing the television audience a Happy Christmas.  Really lovely.",1385942400,6,687,5.079646017699115
5927749,2,B00EMLRKIS,For those of you who were looking for classics you may want to look elsewhere. The beginning of this film is like a long commercial of what is to come. You have to wade through a long introduction of each show before you get to the actual show. Although it was deliver earlier than promised I could not get through the entire film.,1385856000,,331,4.26984126984127
5927750,5,B00EMLRKIS,"Each year there are many CHRISTMAS video collections. Most of
them are movie collections from the various ""movie channels""
and Networks. I always prefer the basics. This collection has
some of my favorite programs from the B&W era through the early
color-broadcast years.
The FUN part of these are seeing familiar faces as ""bit"" players
before they get their OWN series. To mention, just, ONE episode:
""The Doris Day Show"" features Rose Marie AFTER The Dick Van Dyke
Show; McLean Stevenson before M*A*S*H; Denver Pyle AFTER The Andy
Griffith Show; and, Bernie ""Doc"" Kopell BEFORE The Loveboat.

These are AUTHORIZED episodes, of excellent quality.",1383091200,26,647,5.221153846153846

5927757,3,B00EMLRKIS,"Another middling release of TV Christmas episodes, and half of these already  are available in other similar  collections (episodes of ""The Donna Reed Show,"" ""Petticoat Junction"" and ""The Doris  Day Show""--though all three are good if you don't already have them). The episode of ""Family Affair""  isn't  Christmas-themed despite the title. And the episodes of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""The Lost Honeymooners"" aren't really saturated with Christmas either,  although the ""Honeymooners"" one is great because it's one where Jackie Gleason famously plays a bunch of different characters.",1418947200,5,588,5.7011494252873565
5927758,5,B00EMLRKIS,"We really enjoyed this DVD, all six shows on here were really good, it takes you back when Television was a good and family friendly thing to watch.",1417910400,,148,4.321428571428571

8606863,4,B00EMLRKIS,"I enjoyed watching these Christmas shows of early television (1953-1970). It would've been nice to see Bewitched, The flying nun, The Patty Duke show, Green Acres, and more from 60's era. I gave this 4 stars, as I saw my first Donna Reed episode here, and totally love it! Family Affair had special guest ""Eve Plumb""(Jan Brady) from the Brady Bunch. Oh, that should've been included too. This disk:
The lost Honeymooners(1953)
The Donna Reed Show (1958)
Beverly Hillbillies (1962)
Petticoat Junction (1963)
Family Affair (1968)
The Dorris Day show (1970)
Still great for all ages, and brings about the real meaning of Christmas, nice for the whole family. (If you enjoy morals)",1490745600,,677,5.0
8606864,4,B00EMLRKIS,Added to my collection,1483747200,,22,4.75
8606865,2,B00EMLRKIS,"No Menu, a bunch of promo/ads and no way to skip them.  Subjected to commercials for other DVDs before getting to a list of the shows on the disc.  NOT a good way to promote one's product when forced to watch stuff before getting to the shows.  I give 2 stars because the shows are what I expected.  But the format of the DVD is NOT.",1480204800,,333,4.0
8606866,5,B00EMLRKIS,Loved the golden age of television & what better time to reminisce than Christmas!!  I love these dvds that include episodes of multiple Christmas shows.  Would definitely recommend!!,1479513600,,183,5.5
