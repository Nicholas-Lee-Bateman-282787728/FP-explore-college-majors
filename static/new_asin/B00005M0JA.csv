1623622,2,B00005M0JA,"Okay, I certainly had no illusions of grandeur when I popped this one into the DVD player, and neither should you.  The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues?  A more apt title would be the Guy in the Cheap Monster Suit From 20 Feet (or 0.00109730 Leagues, if you want to get technical)...
The film, directed by Dan Milner and presented by Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson (hence the incredibly cheapness of the entire affair) stars Kent Taylor, who also starred as Boston Blackie in the television series of the same name along with various cinematic wonders as The Crawling Hand (1963), Brides of Blood (1968), Satan's Sadists (1969), The Mighty Gorga (1969), and Brain of Blood (1972).  The film also stars Cathy Downs, who later appeared in films like The She Creature (1956), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), and Missile to the Moon (1958), Michael Whalen (who also appeared with Ms. Downs in Missile to the Moon, Rodney Bell, Phillip Pine, Vivi Janess, and Pierce Lyden as Andy, the janitor.
The film opens with a fisherman casting a net off a small dingy, I guess, to catch some fish.  Underneath the boat we see a man in a somewhat elaborate, yet highly unresponsive, monster suit.  He pushes some on the bottom of the boat, and this causes the man to let out a feeble yell and fall into the water.  The creature then proceeds to...the best way I could describe this is to say the creature began having relationship with the man in the water.  I suppose it was meant to look like it was attacking the fisherman, but it surely didn't...anyway, the next scene shows the fisherman's corpse and his dingy on the beach, and we meet out main character, Dr. Ted Stevens (Taylor), or, as he's calling himself Ted Baxter, for reasons of his own for now, discovers the body.  As the good doctor is looking over the body, government man William Grant (Bell), or Mr. Grant as he's known throughout the film, arrives and starts questioning Ted Baxter about what he's doing.  Ted Baxter?  Mr. Grant?  I know, I know...if characters named Mary Richards and Murray Slaughter show up, we got us a full blown episode of The Mary Tyler Moore show...anyway, it appears the fisherman died of burns produced by exposure to radiation.  So the pre-martial activities with the sea serpent were just salt in the wound?  Bleeech...
The story progresses, and we learn that a professor of a local university, Professor King (Whalen) is working on some secret project, one of great interest to his secretary Ethel Hall (Janiss) and the professor's opportunistic assistant George Thomas (Pine), both whom he doesn't trust, for good reason.  We also meet the professor's daughter, Lois (Downs), who really has no other purpose in the movie other than looking good and being a romantic foil for Taylor's character.  Apparently the fisherman who turned up charbroiled wasn't the first victim, and the locals have concocted a story about a phantom(?!) haunting the cove, taking people.  What is this, a Scooby Doo mystery?  And what's Dr. Stevens role in this story?  Turns out, as an expert in atomics and `death ray' technology (I kid you not), he was assigned to investigate, but no one told Mr. Grant, who is also looking into the matter.  Apparently Professor King has developed a way to mutate normal sea creatures into monsters, and now one is guarding and feeding off a fissure of uranium within the cove, and killing anyone who comes near it.  Also, it seems the Professor's assistant George Thomas is working with some unknown group to steal the Professor's plans, whatever the heck they are, and get paid big time.  As for the Professor's secretary Ethel, well, she's just nosey, and we all know what happens to nosey secretaries, right?  They get shot with a spear gun in the back.  Oops...I give too much away...oh man, this is too good...who's the killer running around shooting a spear gun at people?  It's no big mystery, as the culprit is highly moronic...I mean, a spear gun?  Anyway, this mess of a movie shambles along, some more people die, people commit acts of idiocy, and the whole thing gets resolved about twenty minutes later than it should have, filling out the 80 minute run time.
The whole film is just so very cheap...the cardboard sets, clunky and unwieldy expository dialogue, utterly inane characters, and the complete predictability of the plot.  It may seem like I've given things away in my review, but I really haven't, as you'll see most of what I talked about coming long before it does...
The print here looks really shoddy, being washed out, grainy, and just all around generally poor.  Is there a better source print out there?  Perhaps, but who's going to bother finding it?  Retromedia does provide a good amount of extras for its' release including Drive-In Antics featuring Fred Olen Ray and Miss Kim (there is a bit o' nudity here, so don't let the kiddies watch), intermission spots, the kind you used to see in theaters and drive ins spouting the virtues of the snack bar and removing the speaker from your car window before leaving the drive-in, a still gallery for the film, Drive-In Antics bloopers/outtakes, and a whole slew of trailers of highly dubious films like the one on this disc along with trailers for Beast of the Yellow Night (1971), Curse of the Vampires (1971), Invasion of the Blood Farmers (1972), Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers (1988), Fatal Justice (1993), Evil Spawn (1987), and Scalps (1983).  I guess if I take one thing away from this film it's if you're going to choose a weapon to murder someone, a spear gun probably shouldn't be your first choice.  I mean, if you miss, it just takes too long to reload, and you completely lose the element of surprise.  There are several releases of this film out there, so features subject to change.

1623623,1,B00005M0JA,"The DVD transfer of this film is of the same shockingly bad quality I am beginning to expect from ""Alpha Video Classics"".  Newsflash to those who transfer movies to DVD -- please don't copy VHS to DVD... it really doesn't look that good.
So anyway, it wouldn't matter even if the quality *was* good.  This movie is complete dreck.  There's very little in here to laugh at or enjoy, and it certainly isn't an interesting picture.
Creature from the Black Lagoon does far better what this film tries (and fails) to do.  In fact it takes precisely 10 minutes of viewing time to recognize this film for what it is: a cheap knock-off of Creature from the Black Lagoon which was released 2 years earlier (1954).
The monster suit is so ungainly and poorly designed that the man inside can barely move, and it looks for all the world like he is afraid to swim or move too quickly for fear of his monster head toppling off.
Save yourself the time and money, and don't bother.  Try the Creature from the Black Lagoon instead.",1070409600,2,1014,4.489130434782608
1623624,3,B00005M0JA,"Strange deaths near an oceanography school are attributed to a phantom by some of the locals.  Various people have come to investigate.  What they find is a powerful radiation source on the ocean floor and a bizarre fish-man guarding it.
Intrigue and counter-intrigue mesh until we are not sure who is on what side (except for one character who always seems shady).  But in the end, the dangerous radiation source is deactivated and, as in Godzilla, the scientist takes the awful knowledge with him.
This is a basic disk with Play and Scene Selection as the only options.
This is a bad movie.  Some would say it was bad enough to be good.  My main problem with the lot is that the first victim we see is knocked out of his rowboat.  Later, it always seems that getting back into a rowboat is all it take to be safe from the creature.
Despite the obvious plug of the title (taken from Beast From 20,000 Fathoms), the creature is rather disappointing (no Harryhausen effects here).  In the early scenes it looks very lion like in the face (complete with mane).  The resemblance disappears when seen from the side.  Unlike the Creature From The Black Lagoon, this rubber suit does not seem designed for swimming so the actor does not move much underwater (lessening the suspense).
I have to say that this is one I will be watching again even if it is not up to the ""bad"" standards of other B-Movies.",1062720000,,1396,4.552
1623625,3,B00005M0JA,"As a fan of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, I could not help but be amused by the coincidental facts that the main character initially uses the assumed name of Ted Baxter and ends up working with an investigator named Mr. Grant.  Luckily, The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues has a little more going for it than this ironic coincidence. As the movie begins, a fisherman is pulled into the water by some monstrous sea creature.  When his radioactive remains wash up on the beach, Ted Baxter is there to find him (though I'm not sure why he was walking along the beach in a suit).  He seeks out the head of the oceanography college, and eventually he confesses that he is actually Ted Stevens, author of two important but controversial books on the use of heavy water for atomic purposes and radiation-induced mutation.  He undertakes a diving expedition off the coast and comes across a huge source of dangerous uranium-induced radioactivity and a monstrous creature seemingly guarding it; from his own limited experimentation, he knows this dangerous, obviously man-made threat must be destroyed.  The scientist is paranoid about his work, which brings him under suspicion.  Also under suspicion are the scientist's secretary and assistant. As the movie progresses, we see the phantom kill a few more people, watch Stevens woo the daughter of the scientist he is investigating, watch in amazement as the scientist changes his jacket an inordinate number of times, and wait for something to happen - this effort is in vain, for the most part.  There are a couple of good explosions near the end, but the conclusion holds no real surprises whatsoever.

The title implies that the phantom originally comes from some place 10,000 leagues under the sea; actually, all of the underwater action seems to take place a couple of hundred yards offshore.  The divers we watch every so often exploring the ocean floor have the remarkable knack to come up to the surface exactly beside their boat, no matter how far away from it they have traveled.  As for the phantom, I thought he was portrayed rather well; he certainly looks like something one would want to avoid beneath the ocean waters, and the moviemakers wisely show him standing still for the most part.  This movie is your typical 1950s underwater monster adventure, offering little to delight but little to disappoint the audience.  In other words, it's not bad - but it's not good, either.",1045612800,4,2429,4.883211678832117
1623626,1,B00005M0JA,"Phantom from 10,000 Leagues is not a great movie. It's not even a great bad movie. It's really for cheesy 50s ARC/AIP SF completists only. The movie is below-average low-budget 50s dreck; talky and slow-moving, with few laughs, and very little 'face time' for the monster. The human drama is only slightly compelling and the infrequently spotted ""phantom"" looks like a big paper milk carton with teeth and claws. Or something. Buy the cool-looking poster instead. Makes Monster from the Ocean Floor seem breezy and action-packed in comparison. The only good thing you can say about this flick is that apparently the Milner brothers made enough cash off of it to finance their magnum opus, From Hell It Came. I wish THAT movie would come out on DVD!
Of course if the disc transfer and extras were good enough, 50s trashcore fans like us would have to get this for the library anyway, right? Unfortunately, this DVD is definitely subpar. To start off, the transfer is fair to mediocre at best. It really looks like it was mastered from an EP mode VHS tape, or recorded off-air from a UHF station, using a loop antenna. Very flat, very grainy/fuzzy; not as bad as a Madacy disc, but close. It's actually hard to tell if it's the print or the transfer that's to blame 'cause it's just so bad overall. And in a really tacky move, to say the least, the otherwise presumably G-rated disc includes several trailers featuring frontal nudity and softcore sex scenes. Not that junior is pestering you to see this movie or anything, but questionable nonetheless. But you're not going to buy this disc anyway; I guarantee you will be disappointed for the money. I would advise waiting for Image or Rhino to get around to putting this out unless you absolutely have to see it.

This sea monster is protecting/guarding an underwater deposit of uranium ore. I think the sea monster is a mutation, created by Dr. Whalen, and is a cross between a number of different sea creatures - but what? Eventually, Dr. Whalen destroys the monster and himself in an explosion.
The movie is not very good, there are no special effects, and sea monster is even less convincing. I have had the movie on VHS for a number of years and just recently purchase it on DVD. The quality on DVD is no different than that of the VHS version.

Pre-Movie Note:
I'm getting ready to get into this incredibly horrible fim with cheesy special effects:  from 1955 ... The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues ..!!
With posters like this, you *know* it's good ..!!

Post-Movie Note:
Okay ... This movie really blows ... it's gotten far too serious and there's only one sea monster that moves as slow as a turtle and head butts boats with his horns to tip the folks over who, just a moment ago, were swimming past him. He's funny to watch but you don't see enough of him.
AND ... there's no sexy chick being groped by a leering sea monster like the poster suggests*",1354924800,,635,4.456896551724138
1623632,3,B00005M0JA,"""No Andy that is one of mans follies. ""

One great advantage to this Uh.... Movie is we get to see the hokey creatures up front.  The story unfolds fast and the plot is set up front. Then we get to see it unfold. Sort of like an old Colombo (Peter Falk) show where everyone knows the culprit in advance. We also get some really bad background music with a 50's feel.

Professor King (Michael Whalen) dabbles with the forces of nature and gets the standard results. His daughter Lois (Cathy Downs) of course knows nothing about it; if she had only known in time. Lois and Dr. King are perused by a technical investigator, Dr. Ted Stevens (Kent Taylor.)

Someone is dispatching people with a scuba spear. Who and why. Just what is the secret?

I wanted to give this movie one star but on reflection I really watched it.

The rubber suit looks ridiculous but not funny, there is nothing to generate any interest in sitting through it, and the acting is utterly abysmal.

1623634,2,B00005M0JA,"There have been some good low budget sea monster movies but this most emphatically is not among their number as it fails on every level-acting ,effects ,script and photography .

When Professor King ,played by Michael Whalen ,begins experimenting with an underwater atomic light there is an unforseeen consequence -the creation of a mutant combination of a turtle and an alligator (and clearly played by a performer in a rubber monster suit).To add a layer of cold war paranoia to the plot we also have a secondary story in which the Soviets set out to steal the light and the intrepid US agent Ted ( a wooden Kent Taylor)  ,must thwart the dastardly plans of the Soviet spy ,Wanda (Helene Stanton).Being a resourceful sort of chap he also finds tme for an amorous dalliance with the professor's daughter,Lois -played in the nearest thing to an adequate performance by Cathy Downs .

1623636,1,B00005M0JA,"PHANTOM FROM 10,000 LEAGUES is one of those movies that induces a state of near-hypnosis, before deep REM sleep sets in. Kent Taylor could well be the dullest leading man to ever saunter onto a movie set! His Dr. Ted Stevens is a snore-a-minute mannequin in a suit. Anyway, Stevens must investigate a series of deaths (don't worry, they're boring too) that have occurred at the hands (fins) of a creature, obviously designed / constructed by a team of monkeys with mittens on. This ""phantom"" is almost as frightening as Sigmund The Sea Monster, and looks nowhere near as realistic. Of course, radiation is to blame, causing the soggy sea-turd to attack local rowboat enthusiasts without mercy. This film goes out of it's way to be non-entertaining!

Everyone is trying to figure out what's going on and there's even an unfriendly country trying to obtain the scientific discovery.

7944504,2,B00005M0JA,"This is essentially a no star movie that gets one star from being a 50's atomic age movie and because you have to give it one star. The other star is for the quality of the DVD which is very good. You get a trailer with brief commentary by Joe Dante.

This should have been released as a two movie DVD just like with MGM's Midnite Movie Collection. It was released then with The Beast with 1,000,000 Eyes. Regardless, 50's sci-fi fans are grateful for Kino Lorber releasing a blu-ray of this terrible movie.  As is, it's hard to recommend buying it although many people like myself will buy it anyway just because it falls into the category of 50's science fiction and it's an early AIP movie despite being released as American Releasing Corporation.

Kent Taylor stars as Ted Stevens/Baxter in this movie as an oceanographer/author who is investigating deaths off the coast of California. The acting is competent and could have been worse.

The plot centers around a deposit of uranium just off the coast that is mutating creatures and sinking ships. The movie never really makes clear a number of things. We are not sure about which nation is involved in the subplot. We never know if the creature(phantom) was created by the uranium or by Professor King's experiments nor is it clear how the uranium got there.. Professor Kings experiments are never completely explained and the secretary's motivations are never really explained either. The Phantom is not really a phantom as it is very easily scene and makes no effort to disguise itself. As far as 10,000 Leagues goes (30,000) miles, it's more like the Phantom from 50 feet. The only other creature we see is a mutated turtle. The character of George is just pathetic. Why doesn't he just run up to his victims and shoot them rather than hide in bushes on a hill far away and miss? He can learn a lesson in speaking English too....""You see too much, you should wear blinkers""...it's 'blinders,' George!

The special effects, which essentially consists of the Phantom's outfit are terrible. The creature looks pathetic and nothing like that of the creature on the poster/cover. However it is not as bad as the one in Roger Corman's Creature from the Haunted Sea, which is possibly the worst ever.
