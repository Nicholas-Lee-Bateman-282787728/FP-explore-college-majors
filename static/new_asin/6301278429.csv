324234,3,6301278429,"I have known about the existence of this movie for years, having seen a brief clip on a Katharine Hepburn documentary. The narration in that documentary included it among Hepburn's many failures during the 30s, leading to her being labelled ""Box Office Poison"". I was prompted to rent it as part of my immersion in things Scottish in preparation for a trip to that country.
I was somewhat pleasantly surprised by this movie; in no way would I consider it as much of a dog as that documentary would have it. Hepburn is young and fresh--I liked her Mary much better than Vanessa Redgrave's in ""Mary Queen of Scots"" thirty-some-odd years later. This Mary is a match for those attempting to dominate her, whereas Vanessa's was always something of a weak sister. Like one of the other reviewers, I also found John Carradine's ill-fated Riccio to be a good characterization--what a woebegone love song he sings to the young queen.
Dislikes? Weird staging is a little too stark for my tastes. This is clearly the same John Ford who made ""The Informer"" a year earlier. How did he break through and develop his other style, I'd like to know. Another discordant note for me was Frederic March; I particularly was puzzled by a scene when he's warming himself by a hearthside, but appears to have lifted up his kilt to relieve himself into the fireplace. I can't imagine that's really what was happening, but look for yourself.
So, feel free to fling yourself into an easychair to see how Kate serves up Mary.",1007078400,4,1497,4.695817490494297
324235,5,6301278429,"This early nineteen thirties film is a classic. It features a very young and exquisite Katherine Hepburn in the title role. Beautiful, unfettered, and but eighteen years of age, she arrives on Scottish soil unheralded. There, she meets with her bastard half brother, the Earl of Moray, sternly portrayed by Ian Keith, who has been acting as Regent on her behalf. It quickly becomes apparent from her half brother and the Scottish Lords that her reign will not be an easy one. Moreover, she is staunchly Catholic and Scotland is strongly Protestant, whipped to Calvinist fervor by John Knox, the Calvinist reformer. Yet, she, herself, preaches religious tolerance, but finds her thoughts on the matter rebuffed. Look for the wonderful Donald Crisp in the role of Lord Huntly, who alone supports her views.

She later meets the Earl of Bothwell, hammily and lustily played by Fredrick March, and it is love at first sight. Yet, she gives in to pressure and marries the Catholic, but dissolute, English Lord Darnley, foppishly played BY Douglas Walton. Unbeknownst to Mary, the Earl of Moray has been plotting with England's Queen Elizabeth to undermine her, and it is they who connived to put Lord Darnley in Mary's sights, knowing his weaknesses.

Lord Darnley, jealous of the Mary's affection for her Italian troubador and secretary, Riccio, played with touching loyalty by a cadaverous John Carradine, as well as of her apparent attraction to Bothwell, conspires with the Earl of Moray and some of the other Scottish Lords to have Riccio murdered. After his murder, Mary plays on Darnley's insecurities and together they flee the palace. Bothwell arrives in the nick of time to hold off the killers, while they get away.

Mary gives birth to James, the heir to the Scottish throne. Ultimately, Darnley himself is dispatched to his death. Mary and Bothwell marry and are hunted down. The Earl of Moray gives them terms that require Bothwell to go into exile, but promises that Mary may remain as queen. Bothwell leaves, but ultimately ends up in a Danish prison and dies insane.  Mary, finds that the Earl of Moray's promise was a false one. His intention is to have her infant son, James, crowned King of Scotland, with himself ruling as Regent, until James reacheds his majority.

Mary flees Scotland and goes to England, expecting succor from her cousin, Elizabeth I. She finds only imprisonment. After years of house arrest, Mary is finally tried for treason, accused of plotting against her cousin, and beheaded. She died knowing that her son, James, would one day be King of England, as he was next in the line of succession, Elizabeth I having no children and not likely to have any.

This is a wonderful, classic film, with great, rousing bagpipe refrains throughout. Whlie it is a little hammy at times, it is still a wonderful piece of theatre. The cinematography is stark, almost chiaroscuro in effect, which contributes to its appeal. It is a very enjoyable film which should appeal to lovers of historical dramas and period pieces, as well as those who simply love a great film.",1000425600,23,3091,4.911877394636015

324272,5,6301278429,"I Think this film is my favorite Kate Hepburn's  movie.  I am not a great Hepburn movie fan though I recognize her as a great
actress .  Often she is (or was) in films I was not interested in.  But I am a great fan of historical dramas is this is a very good one.
She plays Queen Mary as well as I have seen anyone play her.  She plays her as a very young and innocent girl who rises to the
throne in a rather miserable country (at that time!!).  The Protestants are running around raising hell and persecuting the Catholics
and Mary tries to bring folks together in tolerance.  John Knox was the abnoxious leader of the protestant rebels; a real creep.  Anyhow, she is later tricked into a marriage with a rather ""gay"" fellow who actually was gay and a plant from Elizabeth who was
scared to death of her because 90 percent of the English were still Catholic as was Mary.  Sadly she is tricked, abused and
finally pays a terrible price for trying to be fair to everyone.  The Queen is played as sympathetically as possible by Hepburn and
one heart goes out to the young woman who just wanted to rule in peace.  I got this from Amazon and it has been hard to find.
Though its a shame they didn't execute Dr Sweets instead.  Watch it, I think you will love it.  Five glorious stars for this!!",1403827200,5,1291,4.241803278688525

324312,4,6301278429,"A box-office flop in 1936, yet the pageantry and the scenery still shine.  I really liked this film for some time in the first half (it's over 2 hours long!) with Mary making her way to Scotland but as in her historical counterpart, she cannot totally gather the clans who have their own agenda, which includes making her a puppet ruler of Scotland.

She marries for political gain which flops.  She falls for Bothwell of the guard, and that is a flop too.  The movie then plods along - despite the great use of shadow, the cast of many, the great accents and interesting special effects of the time - where Mary eventually is tried and executed.  And Bothwell, goes mad in a Danish prison.

Katharine Hepburn does quite well in this tale.  She confronts her enemies but with empty accusastions and threats.  Her enemies seem to out-maneuver her at every turn.  Katharine's monologue at the end of the film and her confrontation with the judge and jury is quite amazing.

The scenery was top-notch as were the amazing costumes.  But the acting at times was strained.  John Carradine as Mary's secretary, overacts like crazy when it looks like he is abouit to be assassinated.  Was kind of humorous, actually.  The pipers playing and Bothwell riding into the plaza on his high horse was quite dramatic and appealing.

The Queen Elizabeth, played by Florence Eldridge (interestingly the wife of Fredrick March who played Bothwell) really overacts like crazy.  Her rolling eyes and dramatized shouts and her smarmy manner are really not easily accepted by this viewer.  Please, can we have another actress??

Despite some of the plot falls and the slow pace, the film is not a bad peek into the history of England, Scotland, and two women at all odds who both but want what's right for their countries.

But for Mary, a sad, tragic ending.",1320537600,3,1836,4.735015772870662
324313,4,6301278429,"1936's excellent ""Mary of Scotland"" features a young Katherine Hepburn as the spirited and emotional Mary, Queen of Scots, in an historical drama directed by John Ford.  Hepburn plays Mary as passionate but naive, with a fatally slow learning curve about the ruthless politics of her Scottish lords and her great rival, Queen Elizabeth of England.

As the movie opens, Mary returns to Scotland from years abroad in France.  Her arrival and her intent to rule as well as reign disturbs the Scottish lords who have run the kingdom in her absence, triggering a series of plots.  Mary's very solid claim to the throne of England also worries an aging and petulent Queen Elizabeth (Florence Eldridge).

The movie, based on a stage play, moves briskly in a series of set-piece scenes through the events of Mary's life, including a marriage to her foppish cousin Henry Stuart, the birth of a child, an aborted rebellion and a royal murder, and her ill-fated romance with Lord Bothwell (a compelling Fredric March).  Drama and romance get the nod over historical accuracy, especially in a closing scene in which Mary faces down her rival Queen Elizabeth.

""Mary of Scotland"" is highly recommended to fans of Katherine Hepburn as a good example of her early work, and as a well done costume drama.",1312070400,4,1288,4.8807339449541285
324314,5,6301278429,"I LOVE THE HISTORY OF THE CELTIC LAND AND ENGLAND, MARY AND ELIZABETH WERE TOUGH LADIES OF THEIR TIME.

324315,2,6301278429,"John Ford (1894-1973) was asked what he did for a living and he replied ""I make westerns."" Having just viewed ""Mary of Scotland"", it's a good thing that Ford spoke as he did. Based on a play, the film deviates substantially from history, but that's not the problem. The film deviates from what a film should be, and therein lays the problem. This film is poor. The sets are cheap, the music is blaring, and the acting is, shall we say, ""over the top"".  Frederic March (1897-1975), a great actor, is filled with bluster and Katherine Hepburn (1907-2003) gives one of her worst performances ever. Florence Eldridge (1901-88) seems to be anticipating Bette Davis from ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939), but Eldridge was no Bette Davis, although she was, in fact, the wife of co-star Frederic March.

One possible reason for the problems with this film was Ford's infatuation with Hepburn. Ford biographer Joseph McBride called it ""the grandest romantic passion Ford ever pursued."" Hepburn confessed ""I never cared for Mary. I thought she was a bit of an ass...The script was not very interesting. I never quite understood why Jack Ford was willing to direct it."" Duh! How about all those endless close-ups?

There's really no excuse for such a poor film in 1936. The 30s were a great time for costume and period drama, including ""Oliver Twist"" (1933) with Dickie Moore, ""Great Expectations"" (1934) with Henry Hull and Jane Wyatt, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" (1935) with Claude Rains, ""Scrooge"" (1935), ""David Copperfield"" (1935) with none other than W. C. Fields, Errol Flynn as ""Captain Blood"" (1935) and then as Robin Hood"" (1938), and ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) with Reginald Owen.

There are some decent performances from John Carradine, Alan Mowbray, and Donald Crisp, among others.

John Carradine (1906-88) was a terrific character actor. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (1936), ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975).

Donald Crisp (1882-1974) appeared in more than 150 films from 1908 through 1963. He won Best Supporting Actor for ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941) and gave memorable performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""National Velvet"" (1944), and ""The Long Gray Line"" (1955).

Alan Mowbray (1896-1969) appeared in more than 140 films from 1931 to 1962, often playing a butler. He had a recurring role in the ""Topper"" series and made memorable contributions to films such as ""The King and I"" (1956) and ""The Man who Knew Too Much"" (1956). He worked with Ford again in ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) and ""Wagon Master"" (1950).

Of course, good performances from the supporting cast is hardly a good reason to see a film, and these actors almost always did a good job.

This is one film you can miss. It's an embarrassment to the director and the actors.",1287878400,3,3048,4.9375

324339,3,6301278429,"Although typed in the popular imagination as a Western director, most of John Ford's films were in other genres, with the director having a particular interest in historical subjects he rarely got the chance to turn into films. His choice of reading while shooting The Searchers was Gibbons' The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire while he spent many of his last twenty years trying to find backing for a film of Arthur Conan Doyle's saga of Medieval mercenaries The White Company. One of the reasons studios were so wary of letting him follow his instincts was Mary of Scotland, a big-budget failure from 1936 that even his greatest admirers have little good to say about and historians even less. Yet his film of Maxwell Anderson's highly romanticised take on the troubled reign and tragic end of Mary, Queen of Scots isn't that bad. True, it bears only a vaguely passing resemblance to history, it's melodramatic in the extreme and parts of the script and some of the performances are terrible (try keeping a straight face whenever Douglas Walton's camp-as-a-row-of-tents Lord Darnley appears while casting towering John Carradine as `Wee' David Riccio seems sheer perversity) and Donald Crisp sounds like the only real Scot in it, yet if it's more hokum than history, it's rather enjoyable hokum. The best of the film is its last half hour once Katherine Hepburn's Mary is in captivity and Frederic March's Bothwell is going mad in a Danish asylum: the writing improves immeasurably (especially in a confrontation between Mary and Elizabeth that plays less as a power struggle and more as one between the importance of power and love) and Ford's direction becomes quite artful, be it the fading light as Mary realises her refuge is in fact a prison cell, the trial scene with judges sitting literally on high above her or the strikingly shot execution scene as she ascends the scaffold.

Sadly there are no extras whatever on the DVD, though it does boast an excellent black and white transfer.",1197763200,3,2000,4.899705014749262

324341,2,6301278429,"""Mary of Scotland"" (1936) is presently not in print save for used copies (which are of good quality).  The film stars a luminous Katharine Hepburn and a powerful Frederick March, a combination that ought to guarantee a good film.  Yeah.  Well -- -- --

The fact is, ""Mary of Scotland"" is in many ways not a good film.  Considered as pure storytelling, it's fairly OK.  As a biography of Mary Stuart, in the words of Jay Sherman (""The Critic""), it stinks.  The actual life of Mary Stuart is all but lost in a melodramatic plot, over-ripe dialogue, and inexplicable gaps.

The film opens with Mary's (Hepburn) return from her long stay in France -- with nary a trace of a French accent.  Well, be that as it may.  Opening at this point makes sense, one of the few good choices made by its writer and director.  Mary arrives in Scotland despite the intention of Queen Elizabeth I of England (Florence Eldridge) to prevent her.  A niece of Henry VII, Mary's claim to the throne of England is even better than Elizabeth's (whose legitimacy has always been a matter of debate).  Mary's assertion (in the film) that she ""did it all for love"" would, if she actually said it, have been a self-serving lie.  Mary may have liked love, but she loved power.

Eldridge as Elizabeth:  There may have been less effective portrayals of the Virgin Queen, but this one is right down there near the nadir. Aside from her tepid portrayal, she just doesn't have the height.  It's a good thing she isn't required to appear in scenes with (or against) Hepburn, as the comparison would be too awful to contemplate.  They appear together only once, in a phony pre-execution tte-a-tte that reduces the motivations of both queens to petty spleen.  Droll, but the meeting never took place.  By the time of this alleged interview was in a deep state of denial, believing that although she had signed an order of execution her people would know she didn't want it carried out.

The film follows Mary's attempt to establish her rule in fractious mid-16th Century Scotland.  The Scots, generally, are half Pict and half Irish, so fractiousness was the leading personality characteristic.  In her efforts she's supported by the Earl of Bothwell (March). He loves her and she loves him, but the marriage of queens is way more complicated than that

Mary instead marries Lord Darnley, an English lord whose claim to the English throne is at least as good as hers.  This marriage is part of Mary's hope to replace Elizabeth as Queen of England.  It also results in the birth of the future James VI of Scotland and later James I of England.  Darnley is played with earnest foppishness by Douglas Walton.  Walton had a lot of minor roles in almost 60 films, oddly uncredited in many of them.  He does pretty well in this one.  The film, however, ignores most of the complex machinations that lay behind Mary's decision to marry Darnley.

Mary's attempt to rule as well as reign is opposed by a number of Scottish lairds -- particularly her half-brother James Stuart, Earl of Moray, the former Regent of Scotland.  Moray is played staunchly by Ian Keith, a Broadway fixture who also played a large number of ""B"" roles in major and minor pictures.  Mary was also opposed by John Knox, the voice of Calvinism in Scotland, a pompous bigot with a big mouth and a very narrow intellect.  He is played here very effectively by Moroni Olsen, a talented actor who did well playing self-important idiots of that sort.

Mary's mainstay early on was David Rizzio, an Italian troubadour with a talent for politics and intrigue.  Although he has a reputation as rather a pretty boy, he's played here by the great John Carradine -- an excellent Shakespearean on the stage whose stentorian voice eventually landed him in a lot of ""B"" (and worse) horror films.  Rizzio's assassination marks the beginning of Mary's fall from the Scottish throne.

Mary's final defiant marriage to Bothwell leads to her final defeat.  Soon after, she flees to England to seek Elizabeth's protection.  The latter is too wily to let Mary run loose in England, and quickly converts refute into house arrest.  The film then cuts immediately to Mary's trial for treason, skipping over years of her plots and machinations to escape her prison, overthrow Elizabeth, and make herself Queen of England.  In fact, the implication of the film is that Mary was innocent.  Fat chance.  The important (nay, central) character of Sir Anthony Babington is barely mentioned.

The film ends at the scene of Mary's execution, which is not shown.  She is finally shown mounting the scaffold.  This whole scene is the most laughably stupid in the film.  Although the photography is in black/white, it seems clear that Mary isn't wearing the red dress she is known to have worn.  Hepburn's Mary is still young and radiantly beautiful ... although Mary at the time was old and worn and reduced to wearing a wig.  The dog is missing.  Before mounting the scaffold, Mary removes her ruff (as would be necessary), but retains a high collar.  Had she worn such a thing, it would have taken more than 2 or 3 strokes of the axe to take her head.  Of course, in fact, her neck had to have been laid bare.

As a biographical study of Mary Stuart, this film is wholly unsatisfactory.  It says damn little in reality about Mary and even less about her great rival, Elizabeth.  The final scenes in the film present events in such an inaccurate and fragmentary manner as to amount to a complete fiction.  All that we are left with is a fine performance by Hepburn in an expensive -- yet cheap -- melodrama.",1160870400,3,5597,4.694758478931141

The source play has aged as badly as most of Maxwell Anderson's work; the dialogue sounds like a Tudor/Stuart history trot written by Ethel M. Dell.  But the cast breathes vigorous life into stilted dialogue.  Hepburn, generally not the most erotic actress, is surprisingly sexy as the ill-fated Mary -- finally, this performance shows Cukor wasn't completely besotted to think Kate could pull off Scarlett O'Hara.  March looks and sounds every inch the dashing Bothwell (a distant relative of Hepburn's, by the way), and John Carradine shines as Rizzio.  Magnificent production design and breathtaking cinematography, coupled with sensitive, intelligent direction from Ford, complete with canny use of extremely effective closeups, make this warhorse surprisingly sturdy.

In 1936 they got MARY OF SCOTLAND, one of those interminable costume dramas where men wear tights, women tents, and everyone neck collars that look like automobile air filters.

 For a Pulitzer Prize winning play (1933) this movie has a pretty weak plot.  Mary - Hepburn, of course - returns from France to reclaim the throne of Scotland.  There are court intriguers, a weak and vacillating husband, a stalwart be-tammed swain be-named Bothwell (Frederic March), and a Queen in England (Elizabeth - Florence Eldridge) with whom to have a stirring, if historically questionable, penultimate hiss down scene before `the Temptress' Mary is led to the gallows.  The dialogue ain't all that memorable, either, unless hearing Hepburn emote her way through this bit of dialogue - ""I have loved as a woman loves, lost as a woman loses... My son shall sit on the throne! My son shall rule England! Still, still, I win!"" - does it for you.

 The only reason I watched this is because I bought the five-disk John Ford Collection and wanted to get my money's worth out of it.  I tend to get the least-promising ones out of the way first, and hence MARY OF SCOTLAND.  I don't sense Ford was much interested in this one either.  Ford can usually be relied on to insert above average action scenes into the mix, but the few horse charges and sword fights are pretty weak.  I've never seen this one on stage, but on the screen it's definitely a star vehicle, a movie that will probably best be appreciated by fans of Hepburn.  For those of us who still chuckle maliciously when we hear someone refer to Katharine of Arrogance it's tough sledding indeed.",1158364800,4,1772,4.732899022801303
324344,5,6301278429,"This film demonstrates why director John Ford ranks at the apex of great American film directors.  By tackling a costume drama with stage origins and effectively opening it up for the big screen Ford demonstrates his versatility as a director of more than Westerns.  There is a forboding doom that permeates this film that is symbolized by the fog shrouded ship that returns Mary Tudor(Katharine Hepburn) to her beloved Scotland.  She assumes the throne to be met with a variety of intrigues and treacheries from the Scotch noblemen, religious separatist John Knox, her brother, her husband, and not the least her cousin Elizabeth I of England.  Despite these threats Mary maintains her nobility throughout.  Katharine Hepburn is a wonder as Mary maintaining a regal bearing despite the impending doom that awaits.  Frederic March is dashing as the Earl of Bothwell, Mary's love.  The romantic sparks between Hepburn and March are lusty.  My lone quibble with the film is the broad villainy of Elizabeth, portrayed by Florence Eldridge.  The face-off between Elizabeth and Mary towards the end of the film seemed to be used more for dramatic effect than for historical accuracy.  That reservation aside, a great film that is indispensible.",1151366400,6,1239,5.15

After returning from France to rule fairly and justly immersed in the seductive smell of the words, she will taste the power's honey and once more you will convince the enormous distance between the theory and the practice.

The art of governing as Disraeli affirmed, is not logic and has not nothing to do with good intentions. Additionally Nietszche stated: Any man who funds a Republic and doesn't kill Brutus or even doesn't kill to Brutus sons, will just rule a brief period. Forget the innocence in politics. It is word that simply doesn't exist in its dictionary.

324347,4,6301278429,"One of my favorite stories about the absurd way that Hollywood thinks is that in the 1936 film ""Mary of Scotland"" starring Katharine Hepburn as Mary Stuart, her leading man Fredric March plays the Earl of Bothwell, whose real family name was Hepburn.  But since Katharine Hepburn was a direct descendant, it would have been wrong to use the name in the film and suggest the actress was having a love affair with an ancestor.  You just cannot make reasoning like this up in your spare time.
Directed by John Ford, this costume drama begins in 1561 when Mary Staurt returned to Scotland from France as the Queen of the Scots.  Elizabeth Tudor (Florence Eldridge), Queen of England, feared the threat that the Catholic Stuarts presented to the English throne.  Consequently, ""Mary of Scotland"" is a story of political brinkmanship during the Elizabethan period.  Mary tries to strengthen her position by marrying the weak Darnley (Douglas Walton), and putting Bothwell in the position of being her protector.  She gives birth to a son James (later King James VI of Scotland and King James I of Great Britain), but Darnley betrays her to the Scottish chiefs in an effort to rule the kingdom and is killed.  Mary's marriage to Bothwell inflames the Scots even more.  Bothwell leaves the country and Mary is imprisoned by the Scottish lords.  Smuggled out of prision, Mary flees to England and seeks sanctuary from Elizabeth.
""Mary of Scotland"" is based on Maxwell Anderson's play, which had Helen Hayes in the title role on Broadway, although the original blank verse is eliminated by Dudley Nichols's script.  The chief attraction of this bio pic is the final confrontation between Mary her cousin Elizabeth.  Anderson is one of several dramatists who could not accept the historical fact that the two queens never met, simply because the idea of that confrontation is too good to give up.  Under Ford's direction the film is much more about spectacle than history, and there is a nice scene when Bothwell brings in a horde of bagpipes to drown out the religious rants of John Knox (Moroni Olson).  Many scenes are shot at night, to provide a somber tone to the story of Mary's descent and death.
Hepburn has some trouble with the Scottish accent, as she would throughout her career whenever she tried to do something that covered up her distinctive speaking voice.  However, it is the very idea of being a hapless queen that runs against the very persona of Hepburn as an independent woman.  If you contrast the performance and the character from this film with her celebrated Oscar winning role as Eleanor of Aquitaine in ""The Lion in Winter,"" you can easily see the differences on both scores.  This is the most lavish of the costume dramas Hepburn did for RKO, as well as the most historical, despite the noted attempts at dramatic license.  The result is okay, but not great, which is what you would expect from a film that brought Ford, Hepburn, and March together.",1052870400,5,2967,4.82051282051282
324348,3,6301278429,"Mary was/is many a school-girl's heroine and her story is well-known. Mary, onetime consort of the young French king, who had died prematurely, comes to Auld Caledonia, where she is the rightful monarch. To the south, her cousin Elizabeth, Queen of England, fears the threat the Scottish queen represents, as she is next in line for the English throne. Mary, a Catholic, runs up against the Protestant leaders and the power-hungry, recalcitrant lords. To insure the succession to the throne and enhance her position, Mary married the weakling Lord Darnley whom she does not love.....Helen Hayes had played Mary to great acclaim on Broadway; while this picture will never go down in the books as one of the all-time greats,  it did, however, display Hepburn's arresting and distictive personality in a role that called upon all her acting resources - and she revealed herself as an actress of greater range than was previously believed. Ford gave the film careful directorial handling, and it was handsomely mounted in all departments. March garnered excellent reviews as the bold and dashing Bothwell. Both Bette Davis and Ginger Rogers (!) fought for the role of Elizabeth I which was ultimately given to Florence Eldridge (Mrs. March) who did a commendable if not brilliant job playing Good Queen Bess.",1016841600,5,1304,5.093457943925234

Hot Toasty Rag, October 30, 2017

If you love Katharine Hepburn and cant imagine how she got her nickname box office poison, you obviously have never seen Mary of Scotland. Do yourself a favor and keep it that way.

In this biopic of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland, shes surrounded by those opposing her rise to the throne, including Florence Eldridge as Queen Elizabeth, Ian Keith as her power-hungry half-brother, and Douglas Walton as her effeminate suitor. Not completely alone, Kate has a few allies: Donald Crisp as a loyal Scottish citizen, John Carradine as her secretary, and Fredric March as the love of her life. Im not well-versed on any of the details, so I don't know how historically accurate Dudley Nicholss script was, but as an audience member, this movie was atrocious. Fredric March was supposed to play someone so incredibly Scottish, hes never seen in anything besides a kilt, but since hes the same actor who notoriously mispronounced his nemesiss name in Les Miserables, could he really have been expected to speak in a Scottish accent? I wasn't the only one who found Freds lack of accent comedic; Nathaniel Shilkrets music made it clear he thought he was scoring a funny film rather than a dramatic period piece.

Kates portrayal of Maryand Nicholss screenplaymakes her seem like perhaps the most incompetent queen in cinematic history. Donald Crisp dares to stand up to her in one scene, criticizing her for letting herself become a woman instead of a queen, and I completely agree with him. Time and time again shes given the ultimatum of keeping either her throne or her true love, and shes unable to decide. She claims to not care about the crown, but she won't sacrifice it to run away with Freddy? Shes weak, unlikable, and annoying. Trust me, you don't need to watch this movie.",1509321600,,1838,4.810126582278481
