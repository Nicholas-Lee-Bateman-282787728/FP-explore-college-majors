It has, however, encouraged me to 'brush-up' on my Polish language skills. [Part of the interesting aspect of this film is realizing that ""Papusza"" is/was Polish only by accident: being in Poland when the 'no roaming' laws were enforced. What nationality is a Romani or a Sinti?]",1498262400,,432,5.013888888888889
