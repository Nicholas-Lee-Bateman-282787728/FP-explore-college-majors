8443485,5,B0036GPE38,I finally finish watching it last night. it is another good drama. but you either need to speak Korean or read Chinese to understand this series. because the English translation of this movie is terrible. I heard they might stop printing this cheap set soon. get one if you like ASAP. I know there are few copies left from other online website. give it a shot. gook luck. Korean drama series is the best selling now.,1306972800,,416,4.4868421052631575
