He returns to Stella and surprises her.

One regular theme in these Westerns is how a rich and important person in town is really crooked; and how a seemingly guilty person is really innocent. Was this a popular idea from the Great Depression where the failures of the Establishment caused the Great Depression? The recurrent use of this idea didn't hurt sales of movie tickets. There was no excessive use of actors, scenes may have been edited to limit the running time.",1506729600,,2727,4.351669941060904

7931850,5,B000056AUW,"Stage coach robberies! Jail breaks! Showdowns! I got a thrill out of this better than average western. I always watch westerns w ith my grandfather when I visit him and I've gotten into them so I've started buying some to watch when I'm at home. This is one of the first ones I've bought for myself and I made a good decision. The  plot is really tight and involves both governement agents and a wily western gang. The good guys win, but not without a lot of suspense.",1154044800,,468,4.318181818181818
