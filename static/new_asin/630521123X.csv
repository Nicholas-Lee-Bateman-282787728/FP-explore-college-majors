7888589,4,630521123X,"Very old silent film about the beginnings of Communist Revolution.  I have not read anything about this movie but there is probably a fair amount of ""propaganda"" in it.  That being said you can still find it good watching.

Great sequences and cutting.  I don't know who came first Eisenstein or Pudovkin but you see the energy created by cutting. First, you see the action all flowing in one direction.  Then, you see all the action flowing in the opposite direction.  It creates speed, dynamism, emotion of fear/chaos.

I think it gives me a better idea about the backwardness and suffering in Russia around the turn of the century.  Of course, communism didn't help.",1399248000,2,669,4.807017543859649
7888590,3,630521123X,"This was interesting mostly because of the view it gave of how the Russian revolution got started and what started it. It was called Mother, because, I guess, the main character's mother played a small but important part in the event.  The film also gives us an understanding of what the factory workers wanted and needed and an understanding of why communism was able to take hold.  It's ideals, like those of Christianity, were at first high and desirable for the underclass, but like most ideals, they deteriorate over time and get lost, becoming like that which they are trying to escape from in the first place.

 Christianity, as it is today, would not be recognized at all by Jesus.  He told us to forgive but many are seeking revenge, he told us to love our neighbor as ourselves but too many are self-centered, he told us to heal with God's power but we persecute those who attempt to, and even those who boil herbs into tea and give it to the dying in an effort to heal them, for free.  He told us to have one God, but we have so many other gods that they have a permanent place in our lives and we don't even recognize how much we idolize certain people, places and things.  Maybe we shouldn't be so hash with our views of communism.  Maybe we use that as a cover-up for our own lack of true Christianity.",1391299200,,1316,4.386831275720165
7888591,4,630521123X,"Mother is a very interesting Soviet silent film. The story is set during the unsuccessful revolt of 1905, the same revolt depicted in Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin. The mother of the story is caught in the middle of a family conflict, as her son is involved with a group of workers organizing a strike, while her brutish husband is in a group attempting to put the strike down. In the course of the story the mother comes to understand why her son is involved with the revolution. She moves from servile respect for the authorities to sympathy with her son and his aims. She joins the revolution and makes her stand, becoming a symbol of what was to come in 1917.
Like other Soviet films from this period Mother is something of a propaganda piece. Heroic workers are juxtaposed with fat, gloating capitalists, sinister police and cruel judges. But the story is still exciting and brilliantly told. The editing is Russian style, fast and breathless and occasionally a little confusing. Images flash by so quickly that it can be hard to take it all in. However at times the combination of images is outstanding, as for instance when scenes of a group of revolutionaries on the march are combined with scenes of an ice bound river breaking up and becoming a flood. The suggestion is made with cinematic images that the revolution is as inevitable as the flow of the river and will eventually overpower any resistance.
The title role is wonderfully played by Vera Baranovskaya. Her face is marvellously expressive and shows how her character changes emotionally throughout the course of the film. The son played by Nikolai Batalov acts rather like a socialist realist painting, all smiling heroism. His character lacks the depth of the mother. Ultimately it is she who is the heroine in a quiet and determined way. Her bravery, in the end, is terribly moving.
The print used for the Image DVD is very good. It is clear, bright and shows very little damage. The soundtrack is more of a problem. It was added to the film in 1968 and has quite a lot of background noise. Moreover it has sound effects, which is a pity, as the film would originally have been shown with only a music score. The title cards are presented in the original Russian and translated with subtitles. Sometimes these subtitles overlap the Russian text and can be a little hard to read. Also it is rather disconcerting when a great long chunk of Russian text is translated with one word of English. The DVD may have some minor faults, but it is still, without doubt, worth buying, as Mother is a very fine film, a film not as famous as Potemkin, but in many ways equally as good.",994118400,15,2647,4.670235546038544
7888592,5,630521123X,"Pudovkins approach to montage was slightly different than Eisensteins. Pudovkin treated each shot as bricks in a wall, where Eisenstein would emphasise on the collision effect in each cut. This is hailed as Pudovkins  masterpiece and it's a beautiful film, with strong performances and highly  dramatic scenes; the climax is as impressive as they get... The ultimate  motage film must be Eisensteins Potemkin, but ""Mother"" is also a  very good choice. The tranfer is really as good as you can except, but the  disc has no extras.",945907200,15,529,5.0344827586206895
