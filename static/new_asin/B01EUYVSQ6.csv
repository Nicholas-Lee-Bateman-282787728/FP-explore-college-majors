8759608,2,B01EUYVSQ6,"Series looks intriguing, with hero as agricultural student able to see microbes unaided, but the English subtitles are horrible.  Bad translation (like ""all your base our belong to us"" bad), lines often cut off or disappear too quickly to read, skipped lines, and several scenes omit subtitles all together.  It makes for a difficult viewing experience.  I've slogged through eight episodes so far.  If you speak Japanese, I recommend this title, but not for English speakers.",1476144000,2,476,5.223684210526316
