4089771,4,B0038N9X2M,"Just to show that he's got more to him than a guy with a knack for marrying gorgeous actresses (Ursula Andress, Linda Evans, Bo Derek), John Derek even starred in a few films. So he's one reason to see ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST, this umpteenth film iteration of the Robin Hood mythos. Another is that Alan Hale, in his final screen appearance, assumes the role of Little John for the third time. Alan Hale by this time was already pretty long in the tooth, but dang if he wasn't as lively as ever.

How petty and vindictive is King John? The year is 1215, and no sooner does the son of King John's old nemesis, the Earl of Huntington (who was more famously known as. Robin Hood), return from the Crusades than he is summoned by royal decree to compete in an exhibition of friendly combat. If by ""friendly combat"" it's intended that his opponent's lance is capped in brittle metal. Robin Hood's son, also named Robin, survives this treachery, leaving the King to fester even deeper in jealous rage.

Even more troubling to the king, the barons refuse to be properly cowed by his royal commands. King John longs to hire Flemish troops to enforce his rule, but the price is high. Ergo, he re-institutes his old policy of imposing crippling taxes on the people. With England teetering under a corrupt reign, young Robin takes up his legendary father's outlaw habits. He enlists his father's old band of merry men. Luckily for him, Little John, Friar Tuck, Alan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlett still make for spry bandits even if they're now ""greyer in the thatch."" Away they go, vanquishing evil tax collectors and other scoundrels deployed by the King. It's like old times for these aged reprobates.

ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST, released in 1950, doesn't have the timeless pedigree of Errol Flynn's THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, but it's a fairly spirited reimagining and it's briskly paced and shot in crisp Technicolor. It also offers up my preferred (if fictional) account of how the Magna Carta came to be signed. Swashbuckling conventions are observed nicely - one standout is the terrifically staged jousting scene at the start.

John Derek cuts a very handsome and dashing figure and handles himself well in the action sequences, even if the charisma isn't quite there. Guy's pretty athletic, and too bad he didn't do more of this kind of film. George Macready elevates the story with his deliciously malicious turn as King John, with the urbane Lowell Gilmore matching him as the villainous Count of Flanders. Acting wise, a weak link is Diana Lynn, lovely but tame as the King's royal ward, the Lady Marianne de Beaudray. Lynn and Derek aren't really in sync, but what does that matter in the larger scope? ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST, in its humble sensibilities, demonstrates winning doses of skullduggery and derring-do, enough to satisfy a soul craving entertainment on a weekend matinee afternoon. I like that Alan Hale gets to have the last words. It's apropos to the film and maybe even to his career that he closes with: ""Everything has been said, and everything has been done."" Exit Alan Hale.

This DVD also comes with trailers for ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST and A KNIGHT'S TALE.",1273968000,4,3185,4.794171220400728
4089772,5,B0038N9X2M,"Despite being the last of the ""Old Hollywood"" Robin Hood epics, no one is likely to claim that ""Rogues"" is a classic. Still, it remains good, undemanding fun for swashbuckling aficionados. John Derek makes a good-humoured, agile hero, son of the original outlaw, while George MacCready (as Prince John), Alan Cavanaugh and Lowell Gilmore essay a splendid trio of villains. Alan Hale Sr repeats his Little John from the Errol Flynn version but Diana Lynne can't really do much with an underwritten Maid Marianne. Ringing the changes, the plot centres on Robin's part in forcing Prince John to sign the Magna Carta. The action scenes are a bit slapdash, but there are a fair few, including an opening joust and a final duel that mixes swordplay on horseback and on foot.

The DVD itself is a gem. I can't imagine this film has looked this good since it first hit movie screens back in 1950. The image is incredibly sharp, with deep blacks and vibrant colours. The audio is all that one could wish from a sixty-year-old source.

Congratulations to Columbia on a first-class restoration - a great buy for Robin Hood lovers (Hoodies?) everywhere.",1273708800,19,1141,4.846153846153846

4089785,4,B0038N9X2M,"There are countless film versions of the Robin Hood story, as well as many ""sequels"".  Few hew very closely to the ballads, nor capture the joyous spirit of Howard Pyle's lovely telling from the late 19th century.  ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"", one of the ""sequels"" concerning Robin Hood's offspring, does display some of the joy, and is a worthwhile hour and a quarter for those who love swashbucklers or the Robin Hood tales.  The costumes are especially stunning, George MacReady is ever the capable villain, and it's touching to see Alan Hale in his final screen appearance, playing Little John for the third time!  John Derek proves capable and amenable in the leading role and the story moves apace, if with great liberties toward both the ballads and history.  Still, if such liberties don't bother you, and you enjoy mid-century swashbucklers, you could do much worse than ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"".",1301270400,,908,4.986754966887418
4089786,2,B0038N9X2M,"1950's Rogues of Sherwood Forest sees John Derek stepping into Errol Flynn's costume but never managing to fill it: a dull and wooden presence, he sets the tone for a lacklustre and perfunctorily executed hour-and-a-third that only has Alan Hale in his final film playing the role of Little John for the third time going for it. Unfortunately it only reminds you how much better Errol Flynn and even Douglas Fairbanks, for all his prancing and over-emoting, were in Lincoln Green. Not that Derek is actually playing Robin but his son, who finds himself up against King John, who's overtaxing the people once again to pay for an army of Flemish mercenaries to crush them even further before the barons can force him to sign the Magna Carta (""I'll build a gallows. It will be high and it will be strong,"" spits George Macready's treacherous monarch). While Diane Lynne's bland Maid Marianne sends him information from the castle via carrier pigeon, the newly outlawed Robin of Huntingdon and Little John decide to bring all the original Merry Men back together, which is an idea that has promise that the film never does anything with at all. With the exception of the final swordfight (initially on horseback), the action scenes are especially lazily thrown together with actors and stuntmen just going unenthusiastically through the motions because they know this is the kind of programmer it's not worth getting any bruises over. Even the Technicolor isn't anything to get excited about in a film that has contractual obligation written all over it and which even recycles some footage from the earlier and much more enjoyable The Bandit of Sherwood Forest. As Alan Hale says at the end, ""Everything has been said, everything has been done.""

The only extra is a trailer for Hammer's Sword of Sherwood Forest.",1293580800,,1810,4.934426229508197
4089787,3,B0038N9X2M,"1950's ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"", another of Columbia's contributions to the Chivalry genre, is an okay entry, with a few definite 'pluses'; excellent Technicolor cinematography by Charles Lawton, crisp direction by Gordon Douglas, lush, elaborate (if somewhat generic) sets, and an above-average cast for a 'B' feature, including veteran screen 'villain' George Macready (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilda/dp/B00004XPPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilda</a>"") as King John, beautiful (and very busy) screen ingenue Diana Lynn, as King John's ward, Lady Marianne (no one even mentions 'Maid Marion' in this film), and especially Alan Hale, in his final film, playing Little John for the THIRD time (first, in support of Douglas Fairbanks in 1922's classic, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B000KJTC9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>"", then Errol Flynn, in 1938's classic, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood/dp/B00005JKEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>"", and here, serving John Derek). Hale, at 57, may sound a bit tired, but he still has that twinkle in his eye, and appears to be enjoying himself, immensely!

As for John Derek...it's easy to see why he was cast as the son of Robin Hood; facially, he does resemble the youthful Errol Flynn, particularly when he smiles. However, Derek lacks Flynn's athletic grace (he is obviously doubled in every fight sequence), and he lacks Flynn's charismatic screen presence...and, honestly, he's a lousy actor, at least in costume epics (even ignoring his incongruous American accent).

The plot is pretty straightforward; it's 1215 AD, Richard is dead, John is King, and, bitterly aware of the grumbling of the unhappy British nobility (wanting to continue the basic freedoms Richard had given), plans to import an army from Flanders to 'pacify' the population. Unfortunately, the Count of Flanders (a rather ineffectual Lowell Gilmore) wants a hefty fee (and later, Marianne, thus continuing the 'Guy of Gisbourne' tradition of lusting after Robin's woman). Surprisingly reluctant (for a moment), King John proclaims huge taxes (so the people will pay to bring in the army who will crush them...guess that's why they call these 'Dark Ages'...) Meanwhile, young Sir Robin of Huntington (Derek), son of the late 'Robin Hood' (no explanation given of how he passed away), recently returned with Little John from the Crusades, and having survived one murder attempt by King John (still holding a grudge against his father), declares himself against the injustices of the King. He and Little John are imprisoned, escape (with Marianne's aid), and recruit survivors of his father's old gang (Tuck, Alan-a-Dale...who, by the way, never appeared in the Flynn film...and Will Scarlet), and a band of new 'Merry Men', fighting King John's tyranny, and aiding the Barons in forcing him to accept the Magna Carta.

There is a definite effort made in capturing the 'look' of the 1938 film (some shots are framed exactly the same), and there are fewer glitches than in some 'Robin Hood' productions (although some pretty obvious telephone poles appear in the background, during one riding sequence!) The major problems here are a rather uninvolving plot (Robin isn't really even a major player, in the central 'Magna Carta' plotline), a lack of romantic chemistry between Robin and Marianne (oh, how I miss Errol and Olivia!), the lack of a really impressive opponent (Gilmore's 'Count' simply isn't 'dangerous' enough, and a better villain, King John's crony, Sir Giles, played by Paul Cavanagh, is woefully underused, and never even faces Robin), and, most obviously, the nearly magical sparkle that a truly wonderful adventure film has. That thrill of bigger-than-life heroes, derring-do on a grand scale, romance that makes your heart sing...""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"" simply never achieves that kind of magic.

As Alan Hale says, in his very last words on a movie screen, ""Everything Has Been Said, Everything Has Been Done..."" He might well have been summing up the Flynn film against the Derek one!",1289779200,3,4236,5.761980830670926
4089788,4,B0038N9X2M,"This is a well-acted movie on the same Robin Hood theme. However, the always interesting to watch and listen to George Macready and that superb character actor, Paul Cavanaugh make it worth watching. John Derek and Diana Lynn are mediocre, but the movie never stops moving so interest is sustained. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but worth seeing for its entertainment value.",1287705600,,397,4.940298507462686
4089789,2,B0038N9X2M,"Tired, if colourful outing for Nottinghamshire's finest; though in this one, it's Hood's son, Robin (!), doing the honours.
It's all here: forests full of cheery men and jolly fat monks, all dashing about saving kings and defeating despot barons while singing rowdy songs about rebellion and wenches, and shooting big arrows for miles to skewer impossibly tiny targets.

It's ok at best, but the main point of interest is the performance of John Derek as 'young' Robin, which can only be described as .....'sweet.'

Derek's Robin is the most confirmed of bachelors, the dandiest of highwaymen, the ultimate longtime companion.
With his pencil moustache and chiffon tights, he sashays through the canopy in an alarmingly fey manner; pheasant feather cocked in his hat at a very happy angle. Underneath, a bouffant Boney M-style quiff and side-parting glisten with Brylcreem..
( I'm not making this up. Enlarge the product image, the evidence is plainly there to see )

I always thought you needed Robin Hood to be a brave righter of wrongs, a tough defender of the downtrodden - on this showing he couldn't ripple the skin on a custard.

The very idea of merry men living together in the bushes isn't conducive to the depiction of red-blooded heroism, and the sweeping off their feet of swooning maidens is a bare necessity of the genre; so in this context - of Flynn, Greene, Costner and Crowe - it comes as something of a jolt to the sensibilities to see one of the great macho icons of romantic literature, mincing for England amongst the cowslips.

'Rogues' indeed ! This film sneakily inserts small pieces of 'Bandit of Sherwood Forest' - made four years previously and starring a much more....virile Cornel Wilde.
Someone should've reversed the titles while they were about it.....",1287446400,5,1786,4.94
4089790,4,B0038N9X2M,"Of course Errol Flynn is my favorite Robin Hood type flick but these are close behind him.  Far better than the new Russell Crowe Robin Hood --- at least these Robin Hood's keep the original tradition of Robin alive and don't destroy it like Crowe did.  This flick is about Robin's son, but it is in the same tradition as the original story.  I probably should have given it 5 stars but I was comparing it to the Errol Flynn version which I rate at 5 stars.",1286582400,,457,4.2298850574712645

8391523,4,B0038N9X2M,"It's been some time now since I bought the DVD ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest,"" maybe even 2 years or more.  Nonetheless, I've been asked to review it, and I've opted to do so.  When I ordered this DVD, I did so because it was of John Derek acting in the Robin Hood role.  I saw such a film as a child in the 1950s and it was possibly my favorite of all my childhood years.  I was hoping this was at that movie, but it is not.  It appears to be a sequel to the one I saw back then.  Since I recall the original as a classic, this one turned out to be a disappointment for me.  I'm not saying it was a bad video though.  It was not.  I enjoyed it some but it wasn't what I was seeking.  I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as I remember the original being, but I don't want to discourage anyone else from buying or seeing it.  I did enjoy it.  Furthermore, the handle ""Unhappy Texan"" doesn't aptly fit this DVD critique,  That handle stems from a really bad experience I had during the 2013 Christmas season when a gift DVDs someone purchased for me from Amazon.com turned out to be a faulty recording, as was the replacement I got later.",1405382400,,1134,4.076923076923077

Hood junior tries to prevent this, kills several of the King's men gets arrested and is scheduled to hang.  Naturally, he escapes and with Little John's help (Alan Hale, Sr.) goes on a road trip to gather the old gang together (the merry men are a bit long in the tooth but willing), a variation of gathering nuts in May.
