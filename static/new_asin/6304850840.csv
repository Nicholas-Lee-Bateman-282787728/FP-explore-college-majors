934429,3,6304850840,"Funny, I found it to be an interesting documentary on the original lesbian directors,  who are now regarded as pioneers in the film industry. Very entertaining.",1386028800,,160,5.153846153846154
934430,4,6304850840,"I enjoyed the director's determination , on her conquest to seek out this unknown actress, her history, and who was she? As the story unfolds there are other characters along the way. Her co-worker/friend  for one, was not too thrilled nor enthused  assisting  her. Not the nicest person you would want to meet any way. A moody spirit , who works in the video store, practically annoying her boss with her lousy people skills.  You will just have to watch it yourself. Don't want to spoil the suspense.  I also like that it takes place on the East Coast, a nice change of pace from the West Coast scenery.",1374192000,,605,4.513761467889908
934431,1,6304850840,"As a black lesbian I was excited to find this movie and actually get the chance to watch it. It's common knowledge that not many films..independent or mainstream..are out there for us that feature us in other forms of life besides our lives behind closed doors but after I watched this...WOW..I can't believe how much of a waste of money it was!!! I was highly..HIGHLY..disappointed..the script was boring and flatline and the acting was terrible. I literally fell asleep watching it. I've seen some of Cheryl Clarke's other works and enjoyed the others but this..*sigh*..I really don't know what else to say but I have to give this two thumbs DOWN..I will be passing this on to someone else who may actually enjoy this film because I, for one, definitely did not..",1297468800,4,765,4.803030303030303
934432,5,6304850840,"'The Watermelon Woman' is a good mocumentry (a film that pretends to be documentary, but is not actually one). To be sure, Cheryl Dunyene does a wonderful job in this entertaining film that exposes the hidden racism in the Lesbian community, and the whole movie is rich in the painful-funny humor that made Dunyene famous among Indi-cinema lovers.",1229212800,,347,5.0
934433,5,6304850840,"Was it Jamaica Kincaid who said that there are books you just can't part with? That you just have to take them with you after you read them at, for instance, a library? (Well, whoever it was, was she justifying book thefts? I like to think so, for I understand such a quick and strong 'attraction' to certain books myself. There really are books that you can't part with.)
The minute The Watermelon Woman played on the screen, I felt that can't-part-with-this kind of instant affection toward it. It was funny, honest, and cool. I collect DVDs and this one surely made the top on my list for future purchase. I'm almost grateful to the school I attend that its library has it in its collection. I had an absolutely good time watching it.",1041984000,3,737,4.507462686567164
934434,4,6304850840,"This movie is the story of a woman that wishes to become a film-maker.  She becomes obsessed with an actress from the 30's - and begins searching for information on her, and films a documentary in the process.  Soon, the lead's love life begins paralleling the actress that she is researching.
This film can be viewed on several levels... as a (lesbian) love story... a romantic comedy, if you will.  It can be viewed as a story about African American women finding their place in an urban society.  Or it can be viewed as a study of the creative process.
The love story bored me (luckily both Cheryl Dunye and Guineviere Turner are both really hot!)... but the exploration and struggle of the artistic journeys of Cheryl was very interesting.  Any film-maker, artist, photographer, etc. would enjoy this movie... and it should not be dismissed as another silly, unrealistic lesbian love story.",1013212800,12,894,4.855263157894737
934435,4,6304850840,"The best films inform and enlighten as well as entertain.  Cheryl Dunye's debut feature, WATERMELON WOMAN does  just that.  It takes the viewer on a fascinating journey into one black woman's life as she searches for a lesbian role model.  She finds her in the form of a mysterious figure known only as the ""Watermelon Woman.""  Utilizing a light-hearted,  documentary style approach, Dunye (who also stars in the film) has crafted an intelligent and entertaining film that will resonate  with many viewers, irrespective of one's sexual orientation.
Unlike other films dealing with gay characters or themes, WATERMELON WOMAN is not pretentious or preachy.  Instead, it  tells a simple story which touches upon universal themes such as searching for one's place in the world.  Dunye, while not a  polished actress, is nonetheless appealing in her lead role.  Her character possesses a youthful charm that makes you really  care about her journey.  The other members of the cast are also appealing.
Adventurous filmgoers tired of formulaic plots will find much to savor in this film.  Aspiring filmmakers can also look at the  film as a guide in how to create a compelling story on a modest budget. Being one of the few people to actually see the film  during it's brief theatrical run, I was happy to learn that I could see it again in the convenience of my own home.  Now a  much wider audience can enjoy this special film.  Check it out.
On another note, her next film, STRANGER INSIDE, is slated to premiere this year on HBO.  Hopefully, that film will live  up to, if not surpass the promise of Dunye's earlier film.  Only time will tell.",983836800,,1640,4.820143884892087

934487,5,6304850840,"Learned a great deal about my history,  being a woman who is black and lesbian. Intrigues me to obtain even more knowledge about my history. Man oh man the doors this has led me too, I'm amazed and willing to open them. Not only do we face life being who we are, sometimes life also changes us which opens our eyes to embrace others in a way we never thought we would...

934496,1,6304850840,"Unless you come from some remote galaxy and never seen lesbians or americans or any people in general before you won't find this movie worth of your time even for close to free prime streaming cost. if you in fact planning on paying for this movie, don't.
spoiler alert. all it is is 1.5 hr of watching somebody making a youtube failure in ancient times when people lived in caves, hunted dinosaurs and hippies and had no access to android phones, so they were forced to  make payments on cameras and the rest of the tribe was forced to watch poorly shot movies.",1395100800,,562,4.456310679611651
7878291,1,6304850840,"Shot like a documentary, but feels too scripted. The camera movements are the equivalent of a kid playing around with a camera. The film breaks pace a lot by putting a lot of their real life encounters that deal mostly with the sexual encounters with other women. It breaks the tone and the mood and does an injustice to the actual story and focus of the documentary, of finding the Fae Richards. Overall, this is a very poor quality film that hardly even tries to focus on its main topic of the watermelon woman. Couldve been better if the film actually tried to display the topic at hand, rather than adding the useless secondary scripted storyline, which strays away from the search for the true watermelon woman way too many times. Dull from start to finish, and tries to revive itself by the beginning of the credits, but by then it's too late.",1492387200,,849,4.555555555555555
