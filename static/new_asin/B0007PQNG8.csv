2230881,5,B0007PQNG8,"PLEASE RELEASE IN DVD!  I couldn't agree more, this needs to be on instant or DVD, I finally got rid of my VHS and I've never found a better lower body worked :(  Has anyone every tried the lower body work on the Trim Tone & Flex DVD?  I'm wondering if it's similar?  So sad :(",1420761600,,277,3.892857142857143
2230882,5,B0007PQNG8,good replacement video,1419292800,,22,6.666666666666667
2230883,1,B0007PQNG8,"The video came in a short time, but the tape did not play well at all, I thought maybe it was my vcr so i tried it on another vcr, and it was the tape.  The ribbon is loose or something not sure but the picture is wobbly, doubled and sound is bad too. Could not use.",1413244800,,266,3.6666666666666665
2230884,5,B0007PQNG8,"One of the only true ways I've ever lost weight and inches. This should be brought out on DVD, but alas, it's only available on VHS.",1372204800,,132,4.115384615384615
2230885,4,B0007PQNG8,I had this one before and I liked it. I know what I was getting and it is a great floor exercise,1368144000,,96,3.409090909090909
2230886,5,B0007PQNG8,"It is a very good workout for the Lower Body.  You can see and feel the results.  I just love it, actually love all her workouts.",1352505600,,129,3.923076923076923
2230887,5,B0007PQNG8,"I love the floor work on this video. It is killer! The aerobics is fun, too. Partly on and off the step. I wish this routine would be transferred to dvd.",1335657600,3,153,3.967741935483871
2230888,5,B0007PQNG8,"I've used a copy of this video for years now, along with other step aerobic videos of the same era (late 80s to mid 90s) and it never gets old.  The step aerobics portion has a lot of nice rhythmic movements that aren't too hard to follow but feel fun and funky anyway - and not too much like work.  The floor work portion is challenging and very much like work - which makes it highly effective.",1319414400,,396,4.12987012987013
8050363,5,B0007PQNG8,"I did this workout daily for 2 months, then twice a day for 1 month. During that time, I lost 53 lbs, and went from a size 18 to very trim, toned, size 8. The only changes to my diet... fried foods, and soft drinks became occasional foods. The most notable difference was at my waist. After being overweight, it's super flattering to be described as ""the woman with the tiny waist."" I just got such good results from this video. Waist, butt and thighs!!! Best of all was how strong and energized I felt! I walked up a hill that used to leave me breathless and was absolutely amazed at how easily I was able to do it. The power in my thighs was phenomenal, for a workout that required no weights.
I will say that after a couple of months, the leg routine became too easy. I just added ankle weights and it bumped the workout back up.
This is a pretty easy workout to start with, and will give great results, if you stick with it.",1517788800,,928,4.189944134078212
8050364,5,B0007PQNG8,"I love the fact that THIS tape I can do FULLY without worrying about hurting myself. Being over 60 I finish it completely with a sweat. I first had the VHS, then had it converted to DVD at Classic Video on Archer ave. when it was in existence. I started my New Year resolution AGAIN,AGAIN, so far doing great. I will continue working out with this DVD till I hopefully get to a decent weight. THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH JANIE.",1515110400,,423,4.170731707317073
8050365,5,B0007PQNG8,Where can I find this one on DVD remastered? I really like this workout.,1506470400,,72,4.214285714285714
8050366,5,B0007PQNG8,"I've used this tape on and off for over 20 years.  It's a thorough workout and I love it.  I've lost weight, built stamina for things like hiking, and firmed muscle using it.  It and her low-impact aerobic video are my 2 favorite cardio workouts.  The people in them are goofy and time-stamped, but at this point, they're like old friends that I exercise with.

Jane Fonda has re-released a lot of other videos on DVD and I keep hoping she'll do it with this one.  I went to her website and asked.  Maybe if others ask, too, she'll do it.",1504310400,,538,4.267326732673268
8050367,5,B0007PQNG8,"I have owned these tapes in the past, but they wore out. To order them again is a testament to the effectiveness of the exercises. I like the way Jane Fonda presents the routines.",1487894400,,179,4.294117647058823
8050368,5,B0007PQNG8,my wife loves it,1481932800,,16,3.25
8050369,4,B0007PQNG8,"This workout and lower body exercise combination works exceptionally well for pear-shaped bodies!  It builds up endurance, provides great overall toning and burns the fat on the inside of thighs, abdomens and other typical trouble spots.  I use it three times a week, always skipping the day after, and as I have progressed I have added ankle weights and 2lb. hand weights.  The downside is that it is only available on VCR tape.  The images are a bit fuzzy and it is copy protected, so you can't copy it to a DVD.",1438646400,,514,4.554347826086956
8050370,5,B0007PQNG8,"Bring on the neon spandex.  I loved this workout in the early nineties, and it's the exact same one - goofy instructors and all.  So glad I could find it again.  Somehow it just puts me in a happy mood.",1435536000,,202,4.0
8050371,5,B0007PQNG8,Excellent exercise program to keep you interested and build your core lower muscle groups.,1426896000,,90,5.5
8050372,5,B0007PQNG8,"Very good, a little to fast moving for older people towards last part of tape.",1426809600,,78,4.266666666666667
