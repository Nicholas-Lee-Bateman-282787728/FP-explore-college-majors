2198758,5,B00070DW1C,"Perry Mason was certainly the finest courtroom drama ever on television. It was entertainment that kept viewers glued to their seats, waiting for that moment when Perry would nail the killer on the witness stand and free his client.

Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered for the tough defense attorney you wanted on your side in the toughest jam. Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger was the perfectly cast guy you almost felt sorry for, as just when he was ready to gloat over his victory in court, Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer, once again defeating poor old Burger. The relationship of these four people made the mood and mystery of the often gripping conclusion fun to watch. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.

Earle Stanley Gardner's original creation of Perry Mason was a bit more two-fisted pulp type reading, but slowly grew into something resembling the show when it became so popular. Gardner's Perry Mason novels, begun decades before the show and continuing for decades more, are still fun to read. The same can be said of every single show in the series.

The first season, unlike many shows, hit its stride immediately, and remained top-notch television for many years. Like the novels, the title of every episode began with ""The Case of-"" and each one had some wonderful moments, both in and out of the courtroom. Only the first 19 episodes were included on the first release, with the final batch from the first season included on the second. Both are included in this boxed set. The episodes for season one, all 39 of them, beginning in the fall of 1957, are as follows:

THE CASE OF THE------- Restless Redhead -- Sleepwalker's Niece -- Nervous Accomplice -- Drowning Duck -- Sulky Girl -- Silent Partner -- Angry Mourner -- Crimson Kiss -- Vagabond Vixen -- Runaway Corpse -- Crooked Candle -- Negligent Nymph -- Moth-Eaten Mink -- Baited Hook -- Fan-Dancer's Horse -- Demure Defendant -- Sun Bather's Diary -- Cautious Coquette -- Haunted Husband -- Lonely Heiress -- Green-Eyed Sister -- Fugitive Nurse -- One-Eyed Witness -- Deadly Double -- Empty Tin -- Half-Wakened Wife -- Desperate Daughter -- Daring Decoy -- Hesitant Hostess -- Screaming Woman -- Fiery Fingers -- Substitute Face -- Long-Legged Models -- Gilded Lily -- Lazy Lover -- Prodigal Parent -- Black-Eyed Blonde -- Terrified Typist -- Rolling Bones

You can't beat this for entertainment, any more than Hamilton Burger could beat Perry Mason in court. There were great stories, often taking Perry out of the courtroom and his office, but always returning in those final moments of doom for the real murderer. This is one DVD release that everyone who loves great television will want to own. Just hearing that opening theme song will make you nostalgic. Don't pass this one up.",1165190400,53,3241,4.86231884057971

Brander Harris is about to expose a construction scandal when he is framed with an incriminating photo...and charged with murdering the man who arranged for the setup!

His client is found guilty and sentenced to death...but don't get too excited, Mason doesn't really lose. Buerger doesn't actually win, and justice is still served.

2198780,5,B00070DW1C,"This is a series of programs based a character in the writings of Erle Stanley Gardner. The CBS TV series stretched from 1957 through 1966.

Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) is a defense lawyer who is always thought of after it is too late for him to save the defendant from being accused of murder. Supporting Perry is his trusty more than friendly but professional secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale). And their trusty and sneaky private investigator Paul Drake (William DeWolf Hopper, Son of the actress-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper). On the other side of the courtroom is the district attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman) assisted by the not so neutral Homicide Lt. Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins).

You wonder how they get away with manufacturing evidence and the defendant usually has foot in mouth. Then there are the signature courtroom demonstrations.

Be sure to re-watch these programs as you can then see at even in TV programs they can sprinkle in subtle clues.

The was a mad magazine mock that had a boy scout immediately confess from the back of the courtroom upon seeing Perry mason.

Many of the subsequent programs allowed many TV actors of the time to become different characters and even replace the Burger and Tragg characters. You find yourself not only trying to outguess Mason but also saying ""Hey I saw that actor in...""

Even though the characters are from Erle Stanley Gardner the actual programs are written by many different TV writers of the day.

I have on occasion read some of the Erle Stanly Gardner Mason's and they are closely related. The TV version has a few less characters and has to write in some of our favorites.

The DVD's themselves usually have four episodes with a glaring lack of the extras that are so popular nowadays. The plus is that there are no advertisements.",1506988800,,1819,4.883116883116883

2198782,5,B00070DW1C,"Most of the twelve episodes featured in this set would not make my Top 10 List (your mileage may vary), but they carry historical interest of one sort or another: usually, episodes featuring future stars (like Robert Redford) in bit parts. The last episode of the series is filled with cameos of the production staff as extras, including Erle Stanley Gardner as the judge presiding over P.M.'s last case in the original series (05.22.66). Also included is the only episode produced in color (which makes me appreciate the noirish style of monochrome). A full disc of extras are really quite good: screen tests by Burr for the role of Burger, Hopper for the role of Mason; other, rare archival footage; and the first movie in the series of ""Perry Mason Returns"" with Burr and Hale. At present this set is excellent value for money, offering a treasure trove for the series' die-hard fans.",1504483200,5,887,4.803921568627451

As an adult I sought out all the novels and read them all and really enjoyed them. I bought this Ten Buck edition just mainly to see the newly uncovered casting calls of Raymond Burr trying out for roles other than Perry. I honestly didn't intend on watching the random TV episodes, But after watching the rest of the cool stuff on the 4 DVD's, I started watching the TV shows and I'm hooked again. I fear now I must buy the complete series on DVD.There is even the one episode they shot in color. Cool. But I like it best in B&W.  What a wonderful set for so little money. I hadn't seen the made for TV movie since the first time it aired on TV. I thought these movies were good, all were two hours. This is the best ten bucks I've spent in years.

2198791,5,B00070DW1C,"I'm only 30, and born long after this show was cancelled, but I grew up during Nick At Nite's golden age... Dick Van Dyke, Get Smart, F Troop, I Love Lucy, Hitchcock Hour... in the 90s, Nick At Nite was the absolute best source of all the best shows from the 50s and 60s, so I developed a great appreciation for music, movies, and television of the past. Sadly, not many others of my generation, Gen Y, can say the same... it seems like people my age only care about the here and now, and if it's not the latest fashion, it's not worth their attention.

But back to Nick At Nite, it always struck me as strange that Perry Mason was never included in their regular programming, being such a smash hit in the late 50s/early-mid 60s (the exact time period that NaN culled 90% of their shows). Well, up until a couple years ago, despite my affinity for the classics, I knew only of Perry Mason by name. Living back at home, I noticed my mother spent most of her free time after work watching Investigation Discovery, but every night at 11:30 she would be sure to switch over to ME TV for Perry Mason. I eventually started hanging around to catch the episode each night and immediately fell in love with the show.

Over the last few months since beginning watching the show, I've caught all the episodes from season 6 onward. I do enjoy them all but noticed they got a little less in depth as each season started. So I decided to check out a few from the original pilot season... WOW. The first few seasons are INCREDIBLE. Every episode is so much more exciting, and the main reason is Perry... in the later seasons, it seems like all the investigating is done off camera by Paul Drake, and magically Perry figures out everything in the last 5 mins and the person confesses out of nowhere... almost like the writers got lazy.

These early seasons are so exciting. Perry and Paul are running around the whole time questioning suspects and getting involved in the crimes/murders. My mother was only familiar with the later seasons too, so upon picking this collection up and showing some to her, she was floored. She concurs that the first 3 seasons were so intense and that Perry himself is a totally different character... he seems so bitter in the later seasons whereas here, he's very slick, making jokes and getting under suspects' skin. He's more of a detective in these than a simple attorney.

I do love the show no matter what season, but this collection is pure gold. If you're a fan of the show, this is money well spent. I've been spending all my time after work watching these DVDs. The stories are so gripping and exciting, they suck you in... if you're anything like me, before you know it, it'll be 6 am with the sun coming up, and you'll realize you have to work in a couple hours because you stayed up all night, AGAIN, sucked into the crimes and courtroom dramas of 1950s/1960s LA.",1498348800,3,2893,4.463137996219282

2198839,5,B00070DW1C,"A great package deal!  We received this just a few days ago, and have enjoyed several episodes.  So-o-o-o nice not to need subtitles!!!  So nice not to have to play back because one of us says, ""What did he say?""  For most current productions, we need subtitles.  Subtitles are necessitated by superfluous and very loud background music, poor enunciation by today's ill-trained actors, and the modern trend of fast-speak accompanied by many ""ums"" and affected stammering.  (""A-a-a-and..."") To be fair, we need them sometimes for British productions, which is no fault of the actors, just that we need a little help with lingo, parlance, and pronunciation. Those of you who are similarly effected will be glad to know that the sound on these DVDs is excellent, the actors seem mostly be be theater trained, and you can hear every word.

The stories were always interesting, and we are happy that they remain relevant.  With the exception of things like Della dialing the phone with her pencil and Paul not being able to text Perry on updates, these stories could happen today.  There is lots of content, twists, mystery, and the fun of trying to figure out whodunit.

You will enjoy seeing big stars before they were big.  Barbara Hale (Della) introduces each episode and gives you a heads-up on who to watch for.  Be sure to opt for this feature.  Speaking of features, we haven't seen any of them yet, but eagerly await things like Raymond Burr's interview with Charlie Rose.

An aspect of the series that may be of interest to some of you:  Back in the 1960s, a lawyer friend--also a Perry Mason fan--told me that the courtroom procedures were accurately depicted.  This, of course, excludes the guilty party jumping up in court and confessing.

The Barbara Hale interview was long but more about her life and I  went fast forward after 10 minutes. She is very old looking in the interview-still looks nice! The other parts of auditions were just so-so-maybe to many years ago in soft black and white film. I have not seen the selected episodes on the other three discs.

2198880,5,B00070DW1C,"The contrast between William Hopper and Raymond Burr testing for the Perry Mason role is very interesting.
- Hopper was good but had limited emotional range - mostly exasperation and toughness.
- Burr was superb with his wide and subtle range of emotions - including his masterful way of handling the witness, sometimes attacking, sometimes intimate.
From the tests, it is clear that Burr had already completely worked out the character.

Burr as a charming-but-tough Hamilton Burger didn't have the edge that Talman had as a foil.

Ray Collins had his character fully worked out, having played similar roles in movies.

The uncredited woman they had playing Della Street in the tests with Hopper and Burr was not classy enough. Burr was much more nuanced with her than Hopper was.

The man they had playing Mason when Burr was testing for Hamilton Burger played many roles, usually as a businessman, over the years on Perry Mason.

Too bad they don't have tests of Barbara Hale or William Talman.

It has one where Perry loses the case in the first few minutes and spends the rest of the show trying to prevent the execution of its client. It has an episode where Raymond Burr plays more than one part. And it has the final episode, which takes the opportunity to show you many of the people behind the cameras who made the show what it was.

2198958,3,B00070DW1C,"i am responding to ""cap'n phealy's"" review. i too bought this anniversary edition during the christmas season last year and yes, i am very disappointed. oh, i am very much a perry mason fan. it is not ""perry mason"" that i am disappointed in. it is the way this series has been marketed. i first bought this series in ""volumes"" from a well known dvd club. each volume consisted of three episodes that were chosen from various seasons. the club only offered approximately 71 episodes. i believe when the smoke cleared i had bought about 25 volumes. and i probably spent about $500.00.
i was happy when they became available by the season, then i became unhappy again because they are being sold by the ""volume."" plus, as cap'n phealy"" pointed out, they are coming very slowly. i believe, so far, as of this writing, season 4 is available, volume 1. and what is up with the 12 episodes that were chosen to appear on the anniversary edition. i have 3 of the episodes offered on this ""anniversary edition."" they are: ""the case of the treacherous toupee,"" ""the case of the twice told twist,"" and ""the case of the dead ringer.""
the least that the marketers could have done was offered 12 episodes that have not yet appeared on any other ""volumes"" so far. i too felt that i did not make a very good investment, though i do not have the other 9 episodes on the volumes i bought from the club, i'm sure that the marketers already know/knew what had already been made available to consumers. and the episode in which perry mason does not appear must obviously been in reference to the episode that ""betty davis"" appeared in. by the way, raymond burr had to have surgery, which was why he did not appear in a handful of episodes. {i believe my details are right}. i certainly do not appreciate spending my hard earned money on the same item 3 times, unless i literally choose to. first from the volumes i bought from the club. then this anniversary editon. then i will most like buy, eventually the entire series, which of course i will wind up with 68 of the episodes purchased twice and 3 purchased 3 times. i did not mind the ""perry mason returns"" movie. i wish i could say that it makes up for those 3 pesky episodes that i have now purchased twice, but i can't. shame on the greedy marketers who do this sort of thing. my money is hard earned. i do not wish to waste money when through avenues, such as this.",1243209600,3,2401,4.4343891402714934

One dud star for CBS/Paramount and (others).

More multi-volume, overblown pricing from Paramount. Buying any complete season (via split seasons) generally will run at least $50.00...for something that should run in the mid thirties (as other complete seasons ""generally"" do). In this case (as of this review), a whopping overpriced $80.00.

CBS/Paramount will keep releasing the split season nonsense as long as there are buyers (albeit emotionally based buying based on fear of not getting or having, or ""just gotta have"")...guaranteed. It's a venerable cash cow for them; from a business standpoint, they'd be insane to stop releasing split seasons (they can't stop pinching themselves with joy on all the lemmings going for the bait).

Guaranteed Paramount (and others) will/would stop the nonsense if the cash register doesn't ring...it's all numbers.

Make a statement with the pocketbook/wallet in conjunction with ""we will only buy complete seasons."" It's what's called market demand.

2199004,4,B00070DW1C,"It was fascinating to see the interview with Barbara Hale and Arthur Marks about episode #262, ""The Case Of The Twice Told Twist"", the only episode filmed in color. Early in the ninth season, CBS president William S. Paley ordered a color episode to be made so that he could see what ""Perry Mason"" looked like in color, should it be renewed for a 10th season (for the 1966-67 season, the season all prime time shows went color). The cost of the color episode was not much more than black and white. During it's 9th season, ""Perry Mason"" was competing with the 7th season of ""Bonanza"", a show that was #1 in the ratings from 1964-67, and which had been in color since it's premier in 1959. When it was decided that ""Perry Mason"" would not be renewed for another season (in mid-November, 1965) this prototype episode for a proposed 10th season, was aired 2/3 of the way through season 9, as the 21st of 30 episodes, on February 27, 1966. The color print of ""The Case Of The Twice Told Twist"" on this DVD is astonishingly vibrant; a far cry from a murky VHS copy I have from a TBS marathon from 1994. It's also at least 5 minutes longer at 51 minutes, 30 seconds. I was reluctant to purchase this 50th Anniversary Edition until season 3, volume 1, was revealed for an August, 2008 DVD release. When I saw this on sale, I decided I couldn't wait 6 years for the release of season 9, volume 2, to see a restored copy of the color episode, and hear the explanation on why this sole episode was done in color.",1211673600,28,1502,4.3487544483985765

I loved all the extras, whether it was the screen tests to the introductions by Barbara Hale & Arthur Marks to William Talman's posthumous anti-smoking message. It's not quite an easter egg but, if you blink you might miss the fact that Hale & Marks provide commentary for ""The Case of the Deadly Ringer"".

 I am however miffed at the dvd producers for not giving us more. I have heard Season 3 vol 1 is coming in August but why the slow pace?  The series sets have no extras and no music right issues.

The twinkle in her smiling eyes has not withered one iota and she will charm you just as she did all those years ago when she was a regular visitor to our homes as the beautifully intelligent Della Street.  Perhaps it would have been wiser to do this as a single disc anniversary special, but since we're waiting for more episodes anyway, I'm glad to have a preview of what I hope is to come.

2199031,5,B00070DW1C,"Your honor,  I  do object to the harsh treatment this DVD has gotten before its released. I have viewed this evidence and found it able to stand on its own merits.

A little back history on my relationship with the defendant Perry Mason. In the early 1970's, when Ironside was still on prime time television, I was a Perry Mason addict. It was on at five pm, so it was after school viewing. Raymond Burr was as much Perry Mason as he was Ironside. Each may have been different character, but this series like Ironside was memorible.

Now to the evidence....In this DVD tribute, you have 12 episodes and a TV movie  (Perry Mason Returns) of this classic legal drama. This tribute is guest star ladden set (with such actors as Robert Redford, Bette Davis, Leonard Nimoy, Burt Retnold, James Colburn,etc) and also has a  few rare episodes (the only color episode, the last show of the series). If these dozen episodes are edited at all from their original format , you can not tell. These recording seem to have been copied from very clean master recordings of the shows.  Each episode and the TV movie  are introduced by Barbara Hale (Della Street), the last remaining cast member of the Mason show.

Exhibit A...The fourth disk is chock filled with extras like Hopper, Talman and Burr's screen tests for Mason, Old Raymond Burr interviews, New Barbara Hale interview, and Mason cast playing ""Stump The Stars"".

Exhibit B...The most unique extra on the fourth disk is the William Talman's anti-smoking message. For those of you who did not know, Talman was dying of cancer after the show closed. as sick as he was, he left the hospital and recorded an anti-smoking message weeks before he died.

Sidebar, your Honor...I have previous discussed  the good part of the DVD....now to the bad part, charging almost forty dollar for 12 episode is too too much. Also, to harbor on points made by others previously, Paramount CBS  is very slow to release season three of Mason...and when they do,  it is in half season installments. At this time (April 2008), there is no release date for season three volume one.

In summation, this collection of the best of Perry Mason is good television and nice to see these shows on DVD.  However the jury is out if Paramount and its release practices is right.

I do not want a hung jury, so buy this collection and you make your own judgement

2199032,5,B00070DW1C,"Has it really been over 50 years since Perry Mason first walked into a television courtroom? It is a high compliment, viewing ""Perry Mason (50th Anniversary Edition)"", that the episodes are still as fresh, and entertaining, in a new millennium!

The episodes chosen for the collection may not be every fan's choice, but each is a gem; seeing Robert Redford, James Coburn, Adam West, Burt Reynolds, Bette Davis, Dick Clark, and a hot-tempered(!) Leonard Nimoy seamlessly enter the 'Mason' universe is great fun, and four episodes included should be on every 'Top' list; ""The Case of the Deadly Verdict"", where Mason actually LOSES; ""The Case of the Twice Told Twist"", the only color episode ever filmed; ""The Case of the Dead Ringer"", with Raymond Burr in dual roles (he's a hoot as a reprobate British sailor); and, of course, ""The Case of the Final Fadeout"", the last episode of the series. The episodes offer the option of an introduction by Barbara Hale (often with director Arthur Marks), which, while not necessary, are warm and often delightful.

The Disc 4 Special Features are certainly worth the price of the set, by themselves...The first 'Perry Mason' TV-movie, made nearly two decades after the series left the air, is a sweet reunion, as Della (Barbara Hale) is accused of murder, and Perry leaves the bench to defend her, aided by Paul Drake's son (Hale's real-life son, William Katt)...Raymond Burr's screen tests, for both the roles of Mason AND Hamilton Burger (William Hopper's test for the Mason role is also included, and shows just how mesmerizing Burr was, in both roles; thank goodness he became Mason, because as Burger, he'd have been unbeatable!)...a bittersweet ""Person-to-Person"" tour of Burr's home, from the late fifties (Burr, while justifiably proud of his home, rarely saw it during the series' nine-year run, as the nature of the scripts kept him at the studio, 24/7); two excerpts from Burr interviews with Charlie Rose from the 1980s; a loving biography of 'Mason' creator, Erle Stanley Gardner; the tragic TV anti-smoking ad by William Talman (who was dying of lung cancer); a funny ""Stump the Stars"" bit with the original cast, and MUCH more!

2199036,3,B00070DW1C,"I got my DVD set via UPS on Wednesday, April 9th, and started viewing it that evening. I hadn't seen the reviews on Amazon at first though. I agree that CBS/Viacom/Paramount should release Perry MUCH more frequently, and I'd rather see FULL season releases than this half-season nonsense. I bought this 50th Anniversary Special DVD set for the Bonus/Extra features, and to at least have SOME later season ep's on DVD. BTW, I have ALL 271 ep's on VHS taped off-air/cable, some ep's several times each, from back in the 1980s/90s, from WTBS-17, WGN-9, Hallmark, and local station, but frequently with 1980s/90s commercials/etc. not paused out, and also butchered-up ep's for more commercials. Thankfully CBS/Viacom/Paramount has been going back to original 35-mm prints, and keeping the 50-52 mins original length intact! Also, the extras/bonus features on this 50th Anniversary Special DVD eet are things you won't find anywhere else (although some private collectors have released some of this material privately on 16mm, VHS, DVD over the years). CBS/Viacom/Paramount's first two seasons seemed to have been reasonably good in keeping closing credits and the closing production logo/jingle intact. But for the ep's of this 50th Anniversary Special DVD, there are some ep's which have butchered up closing credits! And the closing CBS Production Logo/Jingle is MISSING its ""season-specific"" jingle music! Perry Seasons 3 (1959/60), 4 (1960/61), 5 (1861/62) all originally had a ""generic"" screen full of ""CBS eye logos"" like a ""curtain"", which was seen not only on Perry, but also on TZ, Gunsmoke, Rawhide, HGWT, and other CBS-owned shows of those years. Perry also hsd the statue-of-justice logo added (HGWT had the horse/knight chess-piece; TZ had a planet or asteroid, Rawhide had cattle, and Gunsmoke had a sketch of Matt facing an opponent on main street in Dodge). 1959/60 (and earlier) had ONE particular jingle music on all for these CBS-owned shows, 1960/61 had a DIFFERENT jingle-music for the closing logo for all of these CBS-owned shows, and 1961/62 had yet ANOTHER jingle-music on these CBS-owned shows' closing logos. Previous DVD releases of Perry, TZ and HGWT (and now with Gunsmoke and Rawhide) have retained the MUSIC jingle with these logos. But while the logos are retained in the Perry 50th Anniversary DVD, the music jingle has been muted out! And while on this subject, CBS/Via/Par has been inconsistant on the logos/jingles for old Desilu & Paramount shows such as Mission Impossible, Love American Style, and season 2 of Happy Days. Why can't they retain the ORIGINAL (Paramount) logo/jingle for the particular season that the show originally aired! (which was done properly with Bradys' first season vs. remainder of the series regarding the original Paramount logos/jingles). I hope that the proper original Desilu or Paramount logo/jingle that originally aired for that season will be retained for upcoming Mannix and future releases of Mission Impossible. And when 3rd/4th/5th seasons of Perry do come out on DVD, they will have the (correct) season-specific jingle-music on the closing production logo. And as for the slow release and/or half-season releases of classic CBS and Paramount/etc. shows... it isn't just Perry. Untouchables and Fugitive and others are all coming out in half-seasons and PAINFULLY slow! CBS/Via/Par is NOT presently coming out with ""My Three Sons"" on DVD though, but a couple of months ago, there was an inadvertant press release that the first half of the 1960/61 (first) season of M3S was coming to DVD in June. M3S ran TWELVE seasons, first on ABC (1960-65, the Bub/Mike years), and then on CBS (1965-72 the Uncle Charley/Ernie color years, and later with Katie, Polly, Dodie, Barbara, etc). That would mean TWENTY-FOUR DVD packages if they stick with half-season DVD releases for all 12 seasons! A day after the original press release on M3S on DVD, CBS/Via/Par withdrew the announcement. At least they came out with CBS-owned Wild Wild West in full season releases, and are coming out with full season releases of the 12-season CBS-owned H/50. But also to CBS/Via/Par... where is the second half of three seasons (Seasons 4,5,6) of CBS-owned HGWT (Have Gun)!? You wouldn't get away with tampering with Star Trek or TZ in the way you have with other CBS, Desilu, or Paramount shows!!!",1207785600,4,4346,5.1923076923076925

As is often the case with pop culture reissues and DVD releases, these negative reviews have more to do with outside factors than with the product itself.

What most of the PM fans seem to have their knickers in a bunch about is the slow turnover in Paramount's series of chronological ""Perry Mason"" reissues... I'm sure that that is aggravating for fans, but it doesn't really have much to do with *this* collection, which is a nice selection of a dozen episodes from 1960-63, along with a bonus disc including a Perry Mason movie of the week, and some other features. All the episodes are enjoyable -- pure, vintage ""Perry Mason"" with great black & white cinematography and the refined mix of formula and dramatic chemistry. There are plenty of fun celebrity cameos -- a young Robert Redford (circa 1960... yum!), James Coburn, Burt Reynolds, Bette Davis, Leonard Nimoy and others.

I'm an old fogey, and I'm used to seeing these episodes in syndicated broadcast form, with commercial interruptions and grainy reception. Having the show on disc is a real treat, and the shows look better than ever. Hardcore fans may only settle for year-by-year reissues, but more casual viewers will find this collection to be thoroughly enjoyable.  (Slipcue film reviews)",1206748800,15,1401,4.948936170212766

2199091,3,B00070DW1C,"I'm going to purchase this to get a small ""fix"" to help satisfy my PM addiction. Unfortunately, I noticed that Episode #7 TCOT ""Constant Doyle"", was one that had a substitute lawyer since RB was in the hospital during that time. I've never been a Bette Davis fan, so I don't desire to view this episode. In my opinion, without RB, it's just not PM. I wonder what the rationale was for this episode being included? Good grief, we have to wait long enough as it is to get the regular series episodes with RB. The reason I gave this 3 stars is that at least they include the only color episode, which is one redeeming value. Also, there are some great Special Features. To me, these alone are worth the price and having in my collection.

By their previous ""track record"", it is becoming more apparent to me that the major studios aren't interested in the successful marketing of Classic TV DVDs and it's just a minor ""sideline"" for them. I believe this is because the studios are now managed by big business and are staffed with ""30 somethings"". In this youth obsessed culture, the members of the mass media and the studios are neglecting the lucrative Baby Boomer demographic. To illustrate this point, has anyone over the age of 50 seen TV these days? It's all geared toward 12 - 30 year olds, or thereabouts. Fortunately, I have a small collection of ""Golden Age TV"" DVDs to watch and re watch and rarely watch TV, since, in my opinion, the majority of it is a vast wasteland of vulgar trash geared toward youth.

I too certainly share everyone's frustrations due to the snail-paced release of one of the best TV shows of all time. PM of course. As a result, I have often entertained the fantasy of all of us Baby Boomers pooling our resources and purchasing the rites to ""Golden Age TV"" programs and then hiring an independent AMERICAN company to do them correctly, timely, on high quality single sided DVDs, and reasonably priced. This apparently is the only way we are going to get all the PM seasons before we all ""assume room temperature"". Even if we are still alive for The Ninth Season,Volume 2, there's no guarantee that Paramount will release the entire nine seasons. I suspect they won't. I sure hope I'm mistaken!

Who knows, maybe the ""30 something"" executives would be glad to get rid of all those old black and white (Gasp!),dust covered TV show films (Gasp!) to make room in the vault for the new so called ""entertainment"" digital recordings. Maybe they would cut a real deal and let them go very cheaply. Oh well, just a thought. Any takers?

OK, I feel better now after venting these frustrations.

As long as the full season sets continue to be released, even if it takes 6 months between releases and we are only given a half-season at a time, I will continue to buy them. But this ""collection"" is ill-advised AND ill-timed. If the studio wanted to issue a collection as a ""teaser"" BEFORE the complete seasons were released---that would make some sense. If they wanted to release a collection AFTER all the full seasons had been released to attact those fans who either were not interested in having ALL 230+ episodes---that would make some sense. But to release this set A YEAR AFTER the actual 50th anniversary and AFTER the first two full seasons had been released and fans were eagerly awaiting the third season---well, that is a strategy DESIGNED to annoy people.

Speaking of things popular in the mid-1950's.  Remember the two-seater retro Thunderbird that Ford produced a few years ago?  In my opinion, the reason it didn't sell well is the demographics of those who would buy them were too old by the time it was released.  Ford waited too long.  My personal proof was when I saw a lady get out of hers carrying an oxygen bottle.  More obvious proof is the retro Mustang, first introduced a decade after the Thunderbird, sells much better.  The point of this is if these Perry Mason episodes are available Viacom, or who ever, better release them before their target market goes senile.

*There was the ""Collector's Series"", which went through various permutations of two or three episodes on a disc, not in chronological order, and with extras that were occasionally amusing, but uniformly weak.  They never finished releasing the entire series;

*Then came the promising season-by-half-season-box-set discs;  a bit pricey for something with no extras at all, but at least we were starting to get all of the episodes, in order.  But the rate of release has been dreadfully slow. (Hey, Viacoma: it's not like you're waiting for extras to be produced, what's taking so bloody long?);

Now this ""50th Anniversary"" edition.  Guess what, guys?  The 50th Anniversary was LAST YEAR.  You missed it.  And what are we supposed to pay for?  Episodes that we'll be paying for again, when they get around to releasing more half-asseason boxes (and most, if not all, of which were part of the ""Collector's Series"" that many fans will already own, making that three copies).  A list of extras which would have been great attached to those half-a-season boxes.  A ""Returns"" movie which, while it was nice to see Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale together again (and kind of a hoot for Hale's son William Katt to be playing Paul Drake's son), wasn't really all that great, and is cheapened in memory by the steadily decreasing quality of the later films.

2199143,5,B00070DW1C,"I remember watching Perry Mason when I was six or seven until the show was cancelled many years later.  I remember then being captivated by all aspects of the show:  the Peter Gunn-like music, the consummate acting, the entertaining plot twists and the stirring courtroom drama.  What made this series all the more amazing was that you knew at the beginning of each episode that the defendant was not guilty of the crime charged, but that someone else, who was tangentially related to the plot, was guilty of the crime and would confess in dramatic fashion.  Despite the same outcome in each episode, one was entertained every week, because the process of ascertaining the criminal was always fascinating, the result of Mason's clever mind and relentless cross examination.

But would the series withstand the critical and jaded eye of the adult, or would it seem mediocre and dated?  How many of you remember enjoying a TV program or movie as a child, only to be severely disappointed when you saw the program or movie as an adult?  This was my greatest concern when I saw the series was available on DVD; in fact, I almost decided not to order it.  However, because of all of the positive reviews, I was persuaded to order this first season, and I can say that I'm hooked again, just as I was as a child.

This is TV drama at its best, with provacative screenplays and excellent acting, especially by Raymond Burr, Mason himself.  I look forward to the second season and the release of the entire series.",1196899200,2,1506,4.670454545454546
2199154,5,B00070DW1C,"Excellent video quality. Clean presentation of the shows in chronological order. Every Perry Mason fan should at least try out one of these DVDs.

Perry plays tricks against the Court in some of the early episodes. He settles down somewhat later on, saving his cleverness for the police. Perry's logic, clarity, and acerbic insight when defending a client comes through as fun to watch. Yet, with all his ability as a major lawyer, he still has to pull out of deep trouble in every show.

""What are You doing here, Tragg?"" ... ""Oh, hello Perry. I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by ... and arrest your client for MURDER.""",1189641600,2,639,4.646017699115045
2199155,5,B00070DW1C,I watched many of the shows when they were on television.  It is totally cool to be able to watch them again at my convenience.,1184198400,2,127,4.08
2199156,5,B00070DW1C,"It is unbelievable that TV series made half century ago can still be watchable. Scripts have originality and are rarely predictable. Perry Mason, in the old legal system, is struggling to protect his innocent clients, while being an officer of the court. His sense of justice is very agreeable and I suppose that the era of the TV series, lawyers must be respected far more than nowadays. Court room scenes are very exciting, as Perry Mason always withdraw a confession from the real murderer in the court room. Raymond Burr is still young in the TV series, but reliably performs our hero Perry Mason,with his good voice. Barara Hale, William Hopper, William Tilman, and Ray Collins are all marvelous, and very fit to their roles.

It is very regrettable that sponsors' products appear with the credits at each end of many episodes, as the episodes are of high quality and do not deserve such degrading treatment.

I look forward to watching all the other episodes.",1181433600,4,965,4.842424242424243

2199158,5,B00070DW1C,Finally Perry Mason has come out on DVD.  This show is so fun to watch.  I love to watch each one hour episode of new murder and Perry's brilliant defense. It is great to check out all the period 1950's clothes and styles. I enjoy the regular characters as well as the new ones. The packaging is cool and it is a treat to have these shows at my fingertips.,1170547200,4,356,4.071428571428571
2199159,5,B00070DW1C,"Great DVD set all 39 episodes of the 1957-58 season. If you haven't seen these shows try to watch them with a trial lawyer (they laugh more it's like law on acid). But hey, they aired as Sputnik just went up and gave us Truth, Justice and the American way. Errr, OK that was someone else.

No ads straight product - note as the ending credits play built into the frame as broadcasted is a small octagon with pictures of that night's products. It is NOT a problem, actually it sort'a cool watch and see how much of that stuff would sell today, if you have that kind of free time if not make it a term paper.

Good transfer good sound. See Perry and Della Street when they are just starting out. Watch Judges with no concept what so ever of court room order. Tired of all those bright Spooge Bob colors grooove on the monochromatic.",1170374400,4,830,4.280254777070064

2199163,5,B00070DW1C,"These earliest episodes of Perry Mason are more interesting than the final years of the show in several ways. First, many of the episodes find Perry and team solving cases outside of Los Angeles, so there's a lot of colorful location footage (not to mention an interesting variety of policemen and prosecutors who aren't in the Tragg/Burger mold). The time spent trying cases in the courtroom also seems to be significantly less, with Perry spending more time investigating than arguing with Hamilton Burger. Furthermore, each episode is more of a well-rounded teleplay instead of the formulaic treadmill the show often devolved to near the end of its run, with its predictable breakdown on the witness stand by the unlikeliest suspect.

Viewers need not worry that the characterizations and plots of these first season shows are undeveloped; in fact, it's amazing how quickly things came together. By the fifth episode, Raymond Burr has Perry Mason down pat and never looks back. And the rest of the cast also worked like a well oiled machine within the same time frame.

The quality of these dvds is absolutely remarkable - the clarity is so fine that you can actually see beads of sweat on the foreheads of the actors. Forget about the messy reruns on tv - these are first class reproductions all the way.",1167264000,28,1308,4.887387387387387
8044376,5,B00070DW1C,"Perry Mason Season 1 - 3

These TV films from 1960 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes, usually the Preliminary Hearings, often tell about the law. The individual season reviews contain more details.",1525132800,,1915,4.889230769230769
