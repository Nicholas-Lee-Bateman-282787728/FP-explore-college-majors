486558,5,6302600367,"This is one of Orson's best.  Considering how long it took to complete, it is a marvel of a feat.  The only thing not great about it is the audio in terms of the words matching the mouths.  That's somewhat clear in most of  Welles' movies, so if you like his movies, that won't matter.  Watch this  movie, it is truly riveting.",959990400,,327,4.193548387096774
486559,5,6302600367,"I'm sick of the general notion (mostly in print) that Welles virtually went down hill from Citizen Kane onwards. The fact of the matter is, no one would give him a break, ie; finance. In the few instances that he was given  the money, his films were breathtaking (""Touch of Evil""-for  example).
With Othello, Welles had virtually no backing apart from his  own money. Subsequently, he spent alot of time acting in other people's  movies to make the expensive film costs. This is why ""Othello""  took so long to make. Welles had nightmarish problems with refilming when  actors couldn't make the call after the long waiting periods (read Michael  Macliammoir's ""Put Money In Thy Purse""-his diaries during the  making of ""Othello""). Therefore, Mr Welles travelled through  thick & thin to give us this incredible movie.  From the first image of  the funeral, the angles & the look of the film is staggering to say the  least. Macliammoir is brilliant as Iago. The part where he is hoisted up in  a cage, should be one of those scenes they always flash in a greatest  scenes montage. Orson is in great Shakspearian form & shines through  all his scenes.  I don't think any film maker today could come close to  this film's stunning beauty & innovative camera shots. To think it was  made on a low budget makes you reconsider the quality of something like the  ""Blair Witch Project"", considering the 1950's had yet to invent  the low costing video camera. But this is besides the point.
""Othello"" is THE most underated film in the history of movie  making, and it IS a true masterpiece. No wonder it won an award at Cannes  at the time. God bless Welles' lovely daughter, Beatrice for restoring  & caring for the film. It is an incredible restoration, considering the  lack of existing negatives.  It just shows how Welles' reputation was  tarnished through the years by rediculous criticism. This movie has become  ""The Lost Masterpiece"" because of the critics. It should never  have been lost.  Welles created many myths about himself, but the popular  myth about him shared by most people is the idea that he made this amazing  debut film & then everything from then on was substandard. The rise  & fall nonsense. In reality all his films are of the same standard but  are only marred by bad editing by other people's hands. Welles' genius was  just as rampant in film-editing but he rarely got the oppurtunity. Besides,  these movies were his babies, not some bespectacled ""Barton Fink""  character employed by the studio.  If I had had money while the man was  still alive, I would have given it all to him to make wonderful films. All  these people standing around him like Peter Bogdanovich saying how great he  is when they should have been pulling some strings & getting the man a  deal with the studios. I can't believe his last film ""The Other Side  Of The Wind"", has never been seen because of dodgey finacial deals at  the time. This is a tragedy. What was there not to like about Mr Welles? I  believe he was just too damn good. With him around, nobody had a chance.
So we must be thankfull for the dozen or so films he left us. It's a  shame that he is more respected now than when he was alive. It's as if the  public & the movie community have suddenly realised the magnitude &  importance of this great man's work. Whoops! Anyway, the DVD presentation  is a joy to watch. A must own for all serious DVD collectors. I can pick  out Joan Fontaine as the page boy but can't see Joseph Cotten for the life  of me. Is this another one of Orson's illusions?",957052800,23,3563,4.58664546899841

486631,4,6302600367,"THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO: THE MOOR OF VENICE/ US/France/Italy/Morocco 1952 (3.5 STARS)
The recent restoration of Othello brings to cinematic space the magic of another masterpiece from Orson Welles. To think that a whole master negative of this film (which won the Best film at Cannes in 1952) was lying abandoned in a New Jersey warehouse, was discovered by accident and is the reason for this print that we now have access to, is enough to send shivers down the spine of any Welles-phile.
* Mise-en-scene: Like with many of his other works involving especially Shakespeare, be prepared for Welles' licenses and personal interpretation of subject matter pertaining to Othello.  Yet at the end, we are left with a feeling of deep tragedy and loss for Othello, played by Welles himself, and though we feel that Othello was quite an idiot, we at least feel that he was a very unfortunate idiot at that!
* The problem may have been that the critical scene where Iago poisons Othello's mind and fuels his suspicion is scrappy and left unexplored. This may well have had little to do with Welles' artistic choices, and more with his monetary situation at the time. Welles' penury through his European sojourn is widely known and the passion with which he would invest into his films, every penny earned through moonlighting his booming voice and above-average acting skills is legendary, and should put this in context.
* The figure behavior of Michel MacLiammir is utterly convincing as the detestable Iago who is consumed by jealousy and rage at being overlooked as the second-in-command. But the person to steal our hearts is Suzanne Cloutier who portrays the fair-dame Desdemona. She is every bit as dainty as we would have imagined her to be.
* The stripped down set design works wonderfully for the film and even though budgets may have been the driving force, Othello's barren palace is preceded only by the barrenness of his blinding jealousy and irrational actions.
* Cinematography: As we have come to expect, Orson Welles has a unique cinematic language, through which he creates a Wellesian world of skin-burning close ups, dutched crazy world-frames and low angle shots to create a tense atmosphere of foreboding. But there is no better example of exploring and using frame depth than in Othello. Time and again Welles plays with foreground element to reveal psychologically subjective and meta-diagetic moods while cleverly using the depth in the frame to forward the narrative and plot the next progression. The title shots of the film are harrowing in their effect, with the interplay of high-contrast earth and sky contours that at once establish the mood for an intense cinematic experience.
* Sound & Editing: The restored version has a brand-new soundtrack mentored by Welles' daughter, and while it enhances the experience to telling effect, it is irony to note that just the new soundtrack cost much more than what Welles assembled the whole film for. The fact that parts of the film were shot MOS and other parts used ADR is distracting due to the obvious lack of lip-sync, but in the final analysis, we watch Welles with reverence almost as if on a visit to Sunday Mass, paying homage, never once forgetting that were are witness to a filmmaker stripped of resources, devoid of many essential tools, but one with indomitable spirit who refused to be cowed-down. Othello is magical in its story telling and another worthy showcase of the genius of Orson Welles.",1073692800,5,3477,4.943589743589744
486632,4,6302600367,"Considerable controversy has surrounded this 1992 restoration and re-release of Orson Welles' ""Othello.""  First, the film was wrongly labelled a ""lost classic"" - not technically true, as Welles aficionados will realize.  More seriously, the restoration crew (under the aegis of Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles) re-synced the dialogue and re-recorded the musical score - an abomination to Welles purists.  While it would have been preferable to adhere to Welles' vision for the film, such an endeavor becomes extremely difficult when no written record of Welles' intent exists (as it did with his famous 26-page memo to Universal regarding ""Touch of Evil"").  So it's true that this version lacks a degree of authenticity; but what are the alternatives?  Grainy, scratched, poorly synced public domain prints (c.f. ""Mr Arkadin"" and ""The Trial"")?  Or, worse, no available copy at all (c.f. ""Chimes at Midnight"")?
Anyway, on to the film.  ""Othello's"" existence helps disprove the charges of profligacy and ""fear of completion"" that plagued Welles' career after ""Citizen Kane.""  Shot over four years in Morocco and Italy, and financed largely by Welles himself, ""Othello"" manages to avoid a low-budget look, thanks largely to virtuoso editing that masks the incongruities of time and space.  Welles' powers of invention are on full display here, most obviously in the famous Turkish bath scene (an improvised set necessitated by a lack of costumes).  Set designer Alexandre Trauner's astute choice of Moroccan and Venetian locations instantly establishes a geographic authenticity; Welles initially expolits them for all their stark beauty before retreating into noirish interiors, underscoring Othello's descent into darkness.
Aside from Michael Macliammoir's chilling Method performance as Iago, the acting in Welles' ""Othello"" has been criticized as too restrained and modulated for Shakespearean tragedy.  Such criticism is largely unwarranted, for this ""Othello"" is as much for the eyes as the ears: Welles' bold framing and expressionistic camera angles de-theatricalize the play, undermining the need for stage elocution.  Indeed, the camera is the true star of this film, as Welles generates images that match the grandeur and eloquence of Shakespeare's language.",1072828800,13,2268,5.6382352941176475
486633,5,6302600367,"The restoration team that resurrected this film deserve more than our thanks. They have given us back a film by a master, working with all his considerable, improvisational wit and style. Orson Welles is, by far, the 20th Century's best filmmaker. In company with ""Touch of Evil,"" ""Citizen Kane"" and ""F for Fake,"" his masterful adaption of Shakespeare's ""Othello"" is one of his best films. The thousands of hours of devoted work done by the filmmakers who helped restore this masterpiece (enhancing sound effects, painstakingly matching what had been a criminally out-of-sync soundtrack to the players' mouths, digitally sharpening the film's every frame) is shown to great effect in this DVD. For anyone interested in modern film, Welles' new ""Othello"" is an essential addition to a DVD film ""library.""",1036281600,4,803,5.232558139534884
486634,5,6302600367,"You see, I am one of these people who believe that Orson Welles is the perfect Shakespearian actor.  He has the voice (that awesome voice!), he has the native talent, and he has the passion that makes him.
I am glad that his genius is preserved and restored on this DVD.  In fact, the documentary on the restoration process of this film is worth the price of the DVD itself, if you are into the ""Learning Channel"" type of things.  This film would have been lost, and Welles perfect interpretation of the Bard would have been forever gone.
Welles, due to the ""Citizen Kane"" feedback, had to scrounge for money, and so this project appears jumbled at times, and here and there the lips are out of synch with the soundtrack, since the overdubbed the voices after filming.  There are also some continuity problems with Welles blackface paint.  But Venus de Milo is a beautiful statue, even without the arms.
This ""Othello"" was filmed on location, so the ambiance is perfect, with the canals, the only Italian building, and the long Italian faces that bespeak of character and pith.  The cinematography is pure Gregg Toland, so you feel like you are looking at a series of high-art Renaissance paintings, and not just a blur of people speaking archaic English.
Welles does take some liberties with the script, but that is his prerogative.  The story flows, and you get the feel and essence of the story, which is not as easy as it seems.  I am glad that it was preserved or future generations.",1015632000,4,1488,4.6311787072243344
486635,3,6302600367,"Welle's never had final cut after Kane.  Everything from Ambersons on was in some way shape or form re-edited or ""fixed"" by it's producers.  Occaissionally it was minor interferrence (like ""The Stranger"" or ""Touch Of Evil"").  Frequently is was outright (possibly malicious) butchery like ""...Ambersons"", or ""...Shanghai"".
But ""Othello"" seems to fall into the category of stupidity and incompetence.  It's theoretically possible there was something wrong with the DVD I received, but I doubt it.  Apparently, running out of money, Welles hired a low-end post-prod house, who used their worst staff to complete this film.
Thirty five years later it was restored (not completely, unfortunately), had is musical score reconstructed and re-recorded, and it's tracks re-mixed.  Unfortunately there wasn't much they could do abut the dialog, which remains muffled and often out of sync.
But to the FILM:
The score is STUNNING.  The Images are STUNNING.  What's left of the performances is good to excellent.  Othello is Welles flexing his design muscles beyond the pyrotechnics of Kane and Touch of Evil.
""Othello"" is essentially a series of perfectly composed static shots -- very much like an Eisenstien film (Alexander Nyevsky or Ivan The Terrible come immediatly to mind).  Shot in a real Castle, and brilliantly photographed by at least three DOPs, I think it may be the best designed of all Welle's films.  Here Welles doesn't use the long take, or mise-en-scene to get himself out of trouble: it's all editing, dramatic compositions and lighting.
And once again he shows himself to be the master.
The music is still extrodinary. The transcribing and re-recording are wonderful, and the soundtrack should be released as a seperate item.  Think ""The Haunting"" (Robert Wise), with touches of Bernard Herrman and you'll get the idea.  Even in this department Wells was breaking new ground.
But for all this great stuff, ultimately (for me, at least) it's a magnificent failure.  Once again we get a temping glimpse of what Welles might have been.
For fans, a must see. For everyone else, a curiosity.",998438400,5,2096,5.162721893491124
486636,5,6302600367,"This film blew me away! I always know what I am looking forward to in an Orson Welles film; brilliant camera angles over lapping dialogue and that masterfull voice but I was floored by how well all of those aspects are used in Othello. It's hard to believe it was four years in the making and that the production of this film was marred by unusual circumstances but welles never gave up and the beauty is on screen to marvel at. Welles was a master of Shakespeare since a child so the dialogue flows as if second nature to him and the rest of the seasoned veterans handle it just as well and that is the key to this film. Welles always had pure facial emotion working in his favor and when those huge glowing eyes of his is used in the final scenes as he kills Desdamona its as if headlights of danger are piercing through his face and the dark almost unbearable lighting can't hold back those eyes or the viewers emotions and the soundtrack that damn haunting score never looses it's pacing simply amazing. Finaly Welles' fluxuating girth comes in handy his Othello is so imposing and commanding that u to would fear the repercussions of his hand if you betray him! Just cut out all the lights unplug the phone and watch with amazment at the best adaption of Othello ever made! McLiammour plays Iago with such contempt and an under lying lust for the moor that another level of depth is revealed. The opening is all out dramatic and ever the more shoking and draws you into the story instantly! Welles' reworking of the dialogue and dramatic use of the camera and lighting makes the flick ever so frightening and perverse! Doves flying above in a clear sky, the shores crashing against the waves as Othello is told by Iago of his wife's deceit or the gripping of the knife being shoved into Welles' by himself to redeem himself for the crime he has committed against his love! Shakespeare has never been told with the passsion upon which Welles tells it!",991958400,10,1955,4.49438202247191
486637,5,6302600367,"Orson Welles is arguably the best director of all time, and this is certainly the best Shakespeare adaptation on film.  Fantastic locations, beautiful shots, and Welles is deeply moving in the title role. A must see and must have.  For a terrific reading, see Michael Anderegg's chapter in Orson Welles, Shakespeare, and Popular Culture.",991872000,,337,5.222222222222222
486638,4,6302600367,"If people today remember Orson Welles at all, it is probably as the pitchman who would ""sell no wine before its time.""  The more ""film literate"" might know him as the director of ""Citizen  Kane.""  Most, though, will be unaware that he directed a number of  other outstanding pictures that rank among the very best.  ""Othello"" is one of those.
Incredibly, ""Othello"" was  filmed over a three year period from 1949 to 1952, in nine different cities  in Morocco and Italy.  Welles never did assemble adequate financing for the  film, so he was forced to shoot in a series of small spurts.  They would  work until his money ran out, then he would rush off to take acting jobs to  raise cash to start filming again.
One scene-between Othello (Orson  Welles) and Iago (Michael MacLiammoir) on the beach-starts on one continent  and ends on another, a full year later.  Somehow, though, Welles kept the  whole picture alive in his head.  He also improvised when he had to.  On  the day when they were to film Iago's attempt to murder Cassio (Michael  Laurence), the necessary costumes had not yet arrived.  Welles quickly  moved the action to a Turkish bath where he could dress his actors in only  towels and sheets.  It is now one of the most effective scenes of the  film.
As was typical of Welles, he took many liberties with Shakespeare's  text, trimming it to a tight ninety-one minutes and cutting out the comedy.  The story now begins and ends with the funerals of Desdemona (Suzanne  Cloutier) and Othello; scenes not contained in the orginal, but done here  to good effect. (For those of an auteurist bent, ""Citizen Kane""  and ""Mr. Arkadin"" also open with the deaths of the main  character.)
The first words of the film, spoken by Iago are, ""I  hate the Moor.""  Thus Welles tells us right from the beginning what  the play is about.  (He later did the same thing in ""The Trial."")  Iago hates Othello and he will stop at nothing to bring about his  downfall.  He chooses Othello's wife Dedemonna as his tool to undo him,  cunningly manipulating the Moor until his natural jealousy turns to  murderous madness.
A familiarity with Shakespeare's play will help ease  viewers' passage through the film.  The action is sometimes confusing, a  fact not aided by the total dubbing of the dialogue-much of it by Welles  himself.  Although, his brilliant vision may have been hampered by his  scant resources, it was not destroyed.  Welles remained committed to  telling the story visually, as well as through Shakespeare's prose, and he  succeeded magnificently.
This is no mere filmed play.  It is a stunning  work created by one of the greatest artists the cinema has ever known.  If,  ultimately, it is more Welles' ""Othello"" than Shakespeare's, we  are still the richer because of it.",960854400,56,2781,4.767441860465116

Without dialogue, we see the doomed Othello and Desdemona  in a funeral procession, while Iago is placed in a suspended cage as punishment for his crimes.  A powerful scene-but unfortunately the depiction of the story fails.

The fatal error was the fact that while the dark visuals are impressive, I found the dialogue literally impossible to understand, let alone follow.  This made the story genuinely impossible to follow-and the story did not even seem to much follow the original Shakespeare play.  I cannot comment on how the original film might have been, but the restoration is a failure.",1437264000,,661,4.963636363636364

7828083,5,6302600367,"Seven Reasons to Watch this Movie

1. The Opening 4  Minutes
The film opens with a view of a man laid out for a funeral, shown from just above his head. Hes lifted and carried by hooded monks. We see two other caskets, each with womans body, draped in black lace.
Religious imagery is everywhere: crosses, a bishop in cope and miter, men making the sign of the cross. Peoples clothes appear medieval. The bodies are carried through a crowd, in a castle courtyard, apparently to be taken aboard a ship. A man, under custody of armed guards, is pushed and shoved in the opposite direction. Hes locked into a square iron cage which is suspended from a chain and winched upward, suspended next to the castle wall. Throughout there is eerie music and unintelligible chanting.

The scene concludes with a title card and a brief spoken introduction, then were taken to Venice, and the story begins.

2. Welles the Director
Everything we expect from an Orson Welles-directed movie is in that first scene:
 Unusual camera placements and close ups
 Quick cuts from one face to another
 A moving camera that follows the actors through doors and into rooms
 Crowd scenes with lots of people
 Sharp black & white cinematography
 Time-shifting, from now to then and back

3. The Cast
Welles assembled a British Isles cast (English and Irish) along with one Canadian and one American. Most
notable, other than Welles himself, are Michael MacLiammoir as Iago and Robert Coote (Colonel
Pickering in My Fair Lady) as Roderigo. Detroit native Doris Dowling (from Lost Weekend)
plays Bianca, and shes a hoot. Fay Compton, a BBC-TV veteran, is appropriately in-your-face as Iagos wife Emilia.

Plus, Did anyone ever have a more perfect movie voice than Orson Wells? With him in the lead, along with his veteran British cast, Shakespeares words sound marvelous.

4. Desdemona
Canadian actress Suzanne Cloutier is just perfect in this role. Though not in her late teens, Desdemonas age in the play, she projects, flawlessly, strong-willed innocence and devotion to her husband. Also, the camera really likes her. A lot.

5. Welles the Actor
Filming began in 1948, so we see the Big Guy at his best, powerful and larger-than-life. His makeup is convincing, as is his physical presence: He looks and moves like a soldier.

6. The Locales
Morocco, Venice, Tuscany, Rome. The scenery, especially the Moroccan seaside castle, is like an additional character in the drama.

7. Its on YouTube.
It clocks in at just 91 minutes. Search Welles Othello to find it.

Reviewers Note: Welles assumes that his audience already knows the basic story and characters of Othello, so don't expect any on-screen help (like Venice, 1604 or Cyprus, After the Storm).",1413504000,,2720,4.916849015317287
7828084,4,6302600367,"Orson Welles did a brilliant job on this. Let's start with the fact that I have never seen Othello performed before, and have only read pieces of it. I had heard the names Othello and Desdemona, and that Othello had ""loved not wisely, but too well."" I have heard the names of Iago and Casio, but did not know they were related to this play. So I come to it almost entirely ignorant of the story.

The story is basically this. Othello is a well-respected general in the Venetian army, even though he is a Moor (i.e., black man). Desdemona falls in love with him and marries him against her father's wishes. Then General Othello is dispatched to Cyprus to put down an uprising of the Turks, and asks his right-hand man, Iago, to bring Desdemona along after him.

However, Othello encountered the Turks along the way to Cyprus, and so by the time he arrived there, it was to announce a triumph. Iago and Desdemona were already there, along with Desdemona's principle lady in waiting, who is Iago's wife. Also there is Lieutenant Casio, and therein lies the problem. Well, actually, therein lies Iago. Even though it is never quite clear why he does it, Iago whispers to Othello that Casio is having an affair with Desdemona. It is not true; she is completely loyal to Othello. Iago's basic idea is to get both Desdemona and Casio dead. He uses a subterfuge with a handkerchief of Desdemona's that is wife picked up when her husband threw it down in a fit of temper, sneaking it into Casio's room. He then sets up a scene where Othello is listening and overhears Bianca, a rather common woman, speaking of the handkerchief that Casio gave to her.

There is another man who lusts after Desdemona, one Roderigo, whom Iago attempts to use to have Casio killed. They are in the steam baths and in the confusion, Casio escapes and Roderigo hides under the slats of a boardwalk. Iago finds him there, and where Roderigo expects Iago will help him, Iago actually kills him.

Clearly Iago had some major motive, but I wish I could tell you what it was. Perhaps he intended to be governor of Cyprus instead of Othello, or Casio when Othello was recalled to Venice. In any case, Othello has believed Iago's lies, and strangles Desdemona in her bed. Immediately after, Iago's wife reveals the plotting of Iago in all this, and Othello carries his wife's body with him as he apparently threw himself down a well shaft or air shaft or something that was sufficient to kill him too.

I suppose now I'll have to read the play to find out what is going on here. It wasn't entirely clear, but it was beautifully done.",1336953600,,2596,4.550321199143469
7828085,5,6302600367,"Orson Welles worked on and off for four years to complete his remarkable adaptation of OTHELLO, which was filmed in Morocco and Italy. When cash was short, Orson would take acting jobs (""The Third Man,"" for one) in order to fund his pet project.

Winner of the Palm d'Or at Cannes in 1952, THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO: THE MOOR OF VENICE was released in America three years later and was briefly shown in only two cities. The movie literally disappeared after that-- the negative assumed lost somewhere in France. Forty years later, Orson's daughter searched and eventually located this one and only silver nitrate master in New Jersey, of all places.

In pristine condition visually, restoration was only needed for the audio track. The Chicago Symphony re-recorded note-for-note the original score and this new track was ""flown in."" The results, picture and sound-wise are superb! Pictorially, OTHELLO is by far Orson's best work-- its beautifully moody scenery, imaginative edits, angles and lighting make for a movie that visually rivals the greatest works of the silent era, and in fact would stand up well in that genre.

As for the tragedy of the jealous Moor-- those unfamiliar with Renaissance-era English may at times wonder if the actors are speaking a foreign language! Yet, because of strong visuals the storyline isn't hampered by this. Welles's OTHELLO is the epitome of great film making.

7828086,4,6302600367,"Between 1949 and 1951 Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's Othello on s shoestring budget and often with his own funds earned for acting on other films. The adaptation is sometimes challenging but is often an engrossing cinematic experience.

The film shares more in style with Welles'Citizen Kane than it does with other productions of Shakespeare for the screen. Employing just about every editing trick in his catalogue, Welles creates an experience that is more than a little unsettling. There are low angle shots, high angle shots, rapid fire edits and long pans. The locations in Morocco and Venice are used to maximum effect with the viewer not always knowing where one location ends and another begins.

This film is often considered one of Welles' lost classics and is well worth a viewing if you have the luck to find a copy. The restoration is brillient with the sound now in sync and the picture cleaned of the defects that marred most 16mm prints over the years. It has been said that the restored print in many ways is superior to the print that won at Cannes in 1952.

The principal extra on the disc is a series of interviews concerning the restoration project. I am hoping that an even better edition of this film will be released in the future.

7828087,5,6302600367,"You have to wonder how Orson Welles would ever have to spend a penny of his own to make a movie after Citizen Kane, but I suppose Shakespeare was not considered worthy of expense back then. Here, Welles turned Othello into a picturesque fifties version of a standard high budget classic. Visually, the scenes are candy from the soldiers to the ocean to the flags to the cliffs. As for Welles, he brings an intense dignity to this role. My only complaint is that there are no subtitles so you cannot absorb the bard's language while you watch. This is a tale of betrayal, manipulation, lust, jealousy, and insecurity. It is timeless as it speaks to men of every century. Look around you, how many Iagos slink around us corrupting relations and sewing ruin in our present day. Rarely has such an authentic character been presented in literature. The actor playing him could not appear more sinister if he hailed directly from Hades. This one's worth seeing as Welles added considerable authenticity to this literary classic.",1130457600,3,1022,4.8125
7828088,5,6302600367,"This legendary filmmaker was in his late thirties (38) when he adapted to screen this colossal adaptation of Othello. The film is visually stunning and constitutes in my opinion his best achievement after Kane, despite the terrible acting of the worst Desdemona in any movie. Nevertheless the imaginative direction of Wisconsin 's genius and his performance was offbeat.

This film won Cannes Festival with all honors. Welles was briefly interviewed and asked about if he personally considered this was his masterpiece to date, he answered this pearl- that constitutes a permanent life' s lesson - ""It 's an excellent work, indeed, but the next project; that will be my masterpiece.""

This is precisely the attitude of a true artist; the embodiment of the hunter. Today we have a great working day, but tomorrow it 's another day for fighting and so create, without expecting reward, because the happiness is precisely in this process.",1126483200,3,935,5.104575163398692
7828089,2,6302600367,"While I have great respect for Welles as both an actor and director, the fact that this was done more or less as a pet project of his over several years is readily apparent.  As a Shakespeare purist, I also found his reworking of the text off-putting.  If you're not familiar with the original play, you may have difficulty following this film version.  Finally, much of the audio is difficult, if not impossible in some spots, to understand.  According to the extras documentary, to produce this version the restorers speed up and slowed down the film stock to match it up with the audio and vice versa which in the end leaves the film with a jumpy disjointed feel to it and a sound quality that often sounds like someone is playing a 45 record at 33 rpm.  I found this frustrating because to me Shakespeare is all about the lyrical quality of words.  In my opinion, that is lost in this film.  As cinema and Welles' history, it's interesting.  As a good representation of Shakespeare's work, it's only mediocre at best.  Obviously, I was disappointed with this purchase.",1105660800,11,1072,4.62962962962963
7828090,2,6302600367,"For students of film, this is a must-see and worthy of five stars in that category.  For Shakespeare, don't rely on this interpetation or editing as the story of Othello.  Iago is completely misinterpreted.  Othello would never trust this Uriah Heep-sinister-weasel version.  Kenneth Branaugh has a much better interpretation of this role.  Iago is someone you would trust and buddy with on first impression; that is why Othello is willing to listen to him.  In this version, Iago runs away and does not die in the end.  Many minor scenes and interplay between characters are eliminated.  Roderigo is shrunk to an unrecognizable vestige serving almost no purpose except for the film to be able to make the claim the character was included.  I know that most movie versions of Shakespeare must make choices.  This version distills Othello down to Othello, Iago, Cassio, and Desdemona.  Don't look for much else.  It is stark, dark, and concentrates almost completely on the main plot, but beautiful in its cinematographic depiction, lay-out, and techniques.",1092009600,12,1056,5.147058823529412
