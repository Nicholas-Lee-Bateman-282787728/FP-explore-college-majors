1116612,5,7560072771,"Ok, its a hard movie to watch. It cost me a bit to watch it entirely. it has not all the meaning that L'aventura has. but it's one of my favorite movies. if you have ever read the nietzsche theory about the lack of sense of humanity today, you will find it lively in here. L'eclisse is about a group of people living it. they don't know where they're going, their live is empty and futile. and that is the greatness of this movie. all the characters go in circles around the money or nothing at all. and the ending... after the final part of l'aventura, this is my favorite ending of a movie (and i like this one more than the adventure). just see it for yourself. this movie made me feel bad (in the good sense). and the worst of it all, i felt bad seeing myself and humanity in screen. it made me understand the life on earth. watch it. see it for yourself. life is meaningless, and sad, and depressing. just like the eclipse.",1115942400,4,928,4.219101123595506
1116613,3,7560072771,"The most important thing about this DVD is the fluttering of light and shadow which afflicts approximately half the movie. Reminiscent of the fluttering of silent films, though less dramatic, this flaw in the print used by Criterion was enough to convince me not to buy the DVD, which I had eagerly awaited for many years. Considering the prices Criterion asks for its DVDs, one might have expected something much better.

The movie itself is luminous, beautiful, and a distinct departure from earlier Antonioni films which both fans and critics described as depicting the meaninglessness of modern life and the impossibility of communication between human beings. Here the story is not negative at all. A woman breaks up with her long-time lover, and, in the course of the film, meets another man with whom she begins a relationship that may or may not lead somewhere. Hence the title, THE ECLIPSE -- the eclipse of one man by another.

 The images we see depict the woman's sense of liberation from the old relationship and also her uncertainty about the future. Fittingly, she says to the new man (Alain Delon), ""I wish I didn't love you at all, or loved you much more.""

Be prepared for a 14-minute segment devoted entirely to stockbrokers shouting bids in the Italian stock market. This was too much for me, and I skipped it in later viewings.

On the whole, one of Antonioni's very interesting earlier films, but marred so badly by fluttering in the image that I wouldn't pay $30 for it.

One question I have for people who saw L'Eclisse in theaters or earlier VHS: I have a clear memory of the film ending with the camera descending into the rain barrel which appeared several times during the film, and the word FINE coming out of the dark water. In the Criterion version, this doesn't happen. Monica Vitti walks out of the frame and we see a series of images of people, buses, light poles, etc. with the word FINE appearing beside a street light. This isn't how I remember the ending.",1114992000,4,1993,4.712643678160919
1116614,3,7560072771,"I first saw this film on vhs, and what a disappointment it was! Not that the film itself was bad but the quality of the transfer was terrible, I couldn't even finish watching it. You see the transfer was very bright and the subtitles were in white so you couldn't even read what the characters were saying. So I did something I've never done before. I went out and bought a DVD. I figured the transfer would be much better, and guess what? I was right! Now finally the film can be enjoyed and most important of all, we can now understand what is being said (assuming of course you don't speak Italian).

 ""L'Eclisse"" is the final chapter in Michelangelo Antonioni's trilogy which included ""L'Avventura"" and ""La Notte"". In many ways ""L'Eclisse"" is similar to ""L'Avventura"". If you recalll ""L'Avventura"" was about a woman who falls overboard a ship. We then assume the rest of the film will be about her rescue, but, no two of the characters fall inlove thus abandoning the rescue story. ""L'Eclisse"" starts off with a couple breaking up. Given that we have seen movies before we naturally assume the movie will now be about this couple and what went wrong in their relationship and their eventual making up. But Antonioni pulls the rug from underneath us yet again as the film steers in a completely different direction.

 What the film is ultimately about is alienation. The lead character Vittoria (Monica Vitti) feels disconnected from the world around her. Notice in scenes we see her placed behind a gate, it gives the illusion of her in prison, behind bars, trapped in a world she seems to know nothing about. And pay attention to what Antonioni does with sound. The outside world is almost non-existent. We rarely hear daily sounds such as traffic, birds, people talking. And of course the framing of the shots are important. There are a lot of extreme long shots. This is done to show us how small a piece Vittoria is in this large world. These are just some of the ways Antonioni is able to project his ideas. Yet, despite the craft that has went into the film it is a challenging one to watch. I would not be surprised if many become bored with it. It moves at a very slow, but deliberate, pace. Many scenes are silent, very long pauses, but this silence adds to the films overall effect. The pace perfectly matches the characters emotions. Some could quite effectively agrue the movie has no conclusion. It leaves the audience hanging. It is as if nothing has happened. But, how would you like this movie to end? What exactly would be a satisfying ending and not be considered a cop out? Here we have a character that just seems to be drifting along. Her life doesn't serve a purpose and I think the ending gets that across. I feel it might have been the only way a movie such as this could have ended.

 The movie also stars Alan Delon as Piero, a stockbroker. I think what Piero is suppose to represent is the other side of the world. If Vittoria's life seems to have no meaning Piero's does. He has a good job, makes lots of money, he is an important person, yet, I sensed an emptiness in his life as well. He may have all the material things but what of it if you don't have happiness.

 It's because of this I think some people may get confused in the early moments of the film. They may not see the connection between the two stories; Piero's life and Vittoria's break-up. The two have everything and nothing to do with each other.

 If there is a fault with the film it is this. The movie is really an Italian movie. It is about Italian history and what people were feeling at the time. American audiences may not know exactly what was going on. They may not remember the political climate of the times, especially if someone wasn't born then. What this does is limit the film's audience. It is not an accessible film, then again if you're searching for this film perhaps you fit into the category of those who would be most entertained by this film and will then have a higher appreciation for Antonioni's genius.
*** 1\2 out of *****

Bottom-line: Excellent film by Michelangelo Antonioni dealing with alienation. Monica Vitti seems to do everything right to capture the lost feelings of her character. A deep thought provoking film, that just might be too smart for its own good. I doubt this could ever be a wide audience film.",1114041600,4,4347,4.538952745849298
1116615,3,7560072771,"Michelangelo Antonioni's 1962 ""L'ECLISSE"" (Criterion) is the last film of his unofficial trilogy of ""modern malaise.""  Set in Rome, the story of a young woman (Monica Vitti) moving out of an old and into a new relationship with a driven young stockbroker (Alain Delon) features Antonioni's trademark compositions and issues of alienation and disorientation.  The pristine transfer looks like it just came from the lab.  There's an incredibly esoteric commentary from film scholar Richart Pena and the second disc includes ""Michelangelo Antonioni: The Eye that Changed Cinema,"" an Italian-made documentary.

After years of seeking out acceptable VHS copies of L'ECLISSE, at last this elusive, enigmatic, haunting film has come to DVD. To be fair, some VHS copies were not so bad-looking, but few were letterboxed, so many viewers have never seen the film in its original widescreen format. Criterion presents L'ECLISSE in widescreen format and in a clean, beautifully restored print. There is a good amount of rapid flashing in the opening scene, but as we are engulfed in Antonioni's vision of the world this becomes less noticeable. The soundtrack also has the recessed quality familiar from many Criterion releases, but that can be remedied by a volume boost. Apart from these minor criticisms, this is an exemplary release. It may indeed surpass Criterion's edition of L'AVVENTURA in terms of the supplementary material.

On disc two, there is a pair of excellent features: ""The Sickness of Eros"" features interviews by Antonioni scholars and associates. These people actually have substantial things to say about the film and the director. The other feature, a documentary, ""Michelangelo Antonioni: the Eye that Changed Cinema"" is a perfect example of its kind. There is a lot of footage of the director discussing his films (and saying interesting things about them) as well as other relevant comments by scholars and collaborators. Of even greater interest are the numerous clips and stills of the director on the set of many of his works. Both these documentary features are eminently re-playable.  There is also an informative, film-length commentary by Richard Pena.

L'ECLISSE seems to sum up the ideas that evolve in Antonioni's earlier films from LE AMICHE through LA NOTTE. But it also pares down these ideas and renders them in an abstract, or nearly abstract way. This is why the film is so challenging for some viewers. From the opening shot, we are in Antonioni's world: a composed still-life of  a room and its ordinary contents;  the camera pans right (here we see the benefit of the widescreen format) and a shirtsleeve is glimpsed; immediately, it moves and we see Francisco. This opening seems to say: humans are part of the world. They live in it, but they are part of it too. Vittoria is then introduced, first from below, the we are allowed to see her whole. The film continues to fragment the characters in this way, cutting off our view of their complete bodies, as if to say the people themselves are not complete.  Vittoria's first actual action in the film is to adjust a small, empty picture frame and to reach through it to move some objects on the desk within the scope of  the frame. This is another typical Antonioni theme. He expresses it many times with frames, both picture- and window, and with doorways and arches. Humans need to see a shape to reality, a formality of some kind, to make it comprehensible.

Monica Vitti is Vittoria in this 1962 film. She is the ultimate Antonioni existential protagonist. Presumably sometime shortly before the film begins, Vittoria has become aware of a basic human dilemma: life is constantly in a state of change; we try to hold onto emotions and ideas, but the forward-moving nature of existence can render them meaningless' also, there is some mystery under the surface of life. Vittoria ends a relationship that clearly was 'going nowhere', much to the dismay of her nearly immobile lover (Franscisco Rabal). She leaves him and begins a wandering journey, an exploration that makes up the body of the film. Along the way, she will respond in different ways to her gradually evolving state of mind.  One response Antonioni's characters often have is to try to escape, symbolically perhaps to transcend their existence. Vittoria accepts an invitation from a friend to fly to Verona and back to Rome in a private plane. The experience is exhilarating, but ultimately empty. She also dresses in native African costume and dances quite well in an attempt to transcend her normal world and normal self. This  too is ultimately devoid of real meaning. Very typically of an Antonioni protagonist, Vittoria allows herself to explore the possibility of romance as a kind of escape or distraction.  She meets, and apparently becomes emotionally involved with the impossibly handsome, but empty Piero (Alain Delon).  Through his association with Vittoria, Piero too becomes aware of the incompleteness of life. At one telling point, Vittoria and Piero are crossing a street; she stops and says ""siamo in media"" (""we are halfway"") with a definite portent in her voice and expression.  The film is made up of many small moments like this that seem to express the whole of it. Human experience is only ""halfway""---there is more to life than what we see or think we know. Something else lies under the surface. Antonioni explores this theme in all his films, most famously four years later in BLOW-UP. Here, the style of the film is so rarefied and so nearly abstract that it may take more than one viewing to appreciate it.  Vittoria and Piero, together, realize that truly connecting, finding a meaning beyond the fleeting sexual one (which is yet another empty attempt to transcend) may be impossible. So Antonioni, in perhaps the most famous sequence, permanently removes the characters from the film. As if to emphasize the universality of his theme and the interchangeablility of human experience, we are shown a woman who closely resembles Vitti,  but who passes anonymously from the frame as she did. The famous wordless sequence creates an uncanny, almost frightening sense of anticipation: we feel we are waiting for something to happen, for someone to arrive in this neighborhood of unfinished buildings, circulating city buses, and symmetrical crosswalks, but only a state of pure being seems to exist now. It's almost an Eastern way of looking at the world. The film leaves the viewer with a lot to contemplate and calls many back to see more in it than can be addressed in a brief review like this.

This new Criterion DVD of L'ECLISSE should not be overlooked by anyone interested in modern film.",1111708800,82,6095,4.959803921568628
1116617,5,7560072771,"L'Eclisse visually transcends into an artistic journey through 24 frames per second that displays numerous scenes in which the director Michelangelo Antonioni captures the moment.  Each moment offers a unique experience that is passed on to the audience through the eyes of the characters or the audience's own perception.  In either case, the visuals play a significant part in this cinematic experience, as it is the visuals that tell the story while dialogue merely adds a little flesh to the bones.  Many of these shots that Antonioni provides to the audience could have been free standing photos, or paintings at art museums throughout the world.  Thus, L'Eclisse presents a brilliant cinematic experience, as the visuals play with the audience's mind and emotions.

The opening scene begins with a shot of a lamp that illuminates a room while the audience only can see a small portion of the room.  What the light from the lamp unveils from the darkness is a number of used books, pen, paper, a painting, and a white shirt elbow.  The composition of this scene brings so many things to ponder, as the scene goes on for almost 10 seconds.  The audience might experience notions such as wondering what kind of books are there, what kind of painting is in the background, or whose elbow it is that can be seen.  However, the most important idea might be missed in this scene, which might be the visual metaphor for enlightenment that is provided by the light.  The light brings out these questions from the darkness, as it almost wants to encourage the audience to continue to read into each scene that follows the opening shot, which slowly pans to the right unveiling the identity of person whose elbow has been.

The pan reveals a man, who remains silent for what seems to be a long moment, who is in deep thoughts.  Beside the man, there is a woman in the room, who plays with a picture frame.  This moment is also full of artistic expression, as it initially displays the woman's interest for what is in the frame while the camera later shows the same picture frame from an angled and opposite direction.  Shooting the frame from two different directions while displaying what the woman could see in the frame suggests that the audience can only see a small portion of the truth, unless the audience can manipulate the angle of what is in the frame and see it from all angles.  Combining this notion with the previous of enlightenment provides the idea that the audience can manipulate the truth with their mind.

Silence hangs in the air while the man and the woman continue to exist in the same room.  Eventually one of the two break the silence, as the audience gets to know the man as Riccardo (Francisco Rabal) and the woman as Vittoria (Monica Vitti).  Everything is not revealed at once to the audience, only fragments and pieces, which leaves the audience guessing.  Based on the images and the short dialogues it is obvious that they are breaking up a long relationship and Vittoria is not happy with the circumstances.  But the reason is left for the audience to contemplate, as they can watch Riccardo agonizingly trying to mend the relationship.

After the break up the film continues into a chaotic stock market where the audience can witness people's preoccupation making money.  Even Vittoria's mother is too busy making, or saving money, as she tries to tell her that she has broken up with Riccardo.  Furthermore, there is a powerful scene at the stock market where the stock traders are forced to stop their trading, as they hold a moment's silence in regards to an esteemed colleague that has died.  During this moment of silence the phones continue to ring, and the ringing intensifies while the moment gets longer. It is also revealed to the audience that one-minute cost everyone a lot of money.  This scene brings to mind the short time people have to live, and the importance of making the most of the time alive.

The story continues as a journey for the audience through Vittoria and people she meets.  This journey consists of episodes such as Vittoria meeting two beautiful neighbors one late night, the chasing a dog, the making of a short daily flight, the crash of the stock market, a deadly car accident, and the  rediscovery of love among other life adventures.  Each and every adventure provides enlightening wisdom, as the story continues to deal with life. Antonioni's clever direction focuses on the small details in a moment, and simultaneously depicts a greater significance in the characters' existence.  This is accomplished through great eye for details, as the story visually brings several different notions for the audience to ponder.

L'Eclisse encourages the audience to participate cerebrally through its visuals, which also illustrate the importance of good cinematography, mise-en-scene, and direction.  The cast performs very well and does not convey too much information while leaving the audience in an artistic twilight where only thought can guide the audience on the right track.  The beauty with Antonioni's direction is in the use of symbols and signs in a manner that provides a visual meaning to the audience.  Through this visual meaning the audience can interpret what Antonioni attempts to convey through his tale, yet it leaves the audience with the freedom to make their own judgment depending how they manipulate the ideas that Antonioni provides through his visual representations on the silver screen.",1111536000,45,5477,4.9045553145336225
1116618,5,7560072771,"Author Sam Rohdie wrote in a wonderful book on Antonioni,"" Much of the drama of Antonioni's films occur here in the dead times, outside of the narrative, when everything is done, when there is silence, or emptiness as if in these spaces not only does the film occur, there precisely where 'things' are eclipsed, but a whole new cinema begins to take shape.""  There could be no better introduction to this daring and dynamic work. L'Eclisse is a film that opens with nearly two minutes of dramatic silence between a woman and her lover who have been arguing all night.  It is in this silence that Antonioni explores a new cinema, recording reflections against surfaces, the artificial wind of a fan, the drone of its motor, the prison-like claustrophobia of a doomed love affair in hot and stuffy room.  And as if this isn't enough, Vittoria (Monica Vitti) runs into the promising but ultimately dispassionate arms of Piero (Alain Delon)a stockbroker.  These two beautiful people occupy a world without love, an alien and alienating landscape of promises unfullfilled.  A world filled with the loud and passionate screams of stockbrokers racing to make their next transaction and humans who stuggle desperately to communicate the most simple emotion.  Antonioni and his collaborator, Tonino Guerra were capturing a new and powerful realism in this film by capturing the effect, just after the cause.  In doing this, they opened up a new perspective on realism in the cinema that has only been matched by Andrei Tarkovsky in SOLARIS and MIRROR.  But it is the breathtaking finale of the film, unforgettable in its cinematography and dramatic statement that will have you returning the L'Eclisse, again and again.",1110844800,9,1710,5.039007092198582
1116619,5,7560072771,"Leaving aside the extras, I must say that the transfer is very clean and the commentary is relatively academic though helpful. This is the last film of the Antonioni tetrology with Monica Vitti to come out on DVD and it is very good to add it to the DVD editions of L'Avventura, La Notte, and Il Deserto Rosso.

This film is a long way from the almost Vergillian mood of L'Avventura. There is more of Persona here, and a foretaste of  The segments in the EUR district south of Rome are haunting. The final minutes are--if you haven't heard--unforgetable.",1110844800,3,554,4.585858585858586
1116620,5,7560072771,"Michelangelo directed a trilogy of sorts in the 1960s, beginning with his breakthrough film L'Avventura, continuing with La Notte, and ending with my personal favorite, L'Eclisse (The Eclipse).  All were preoccupied with the theme of alienation, and all featured more or less neurotic and disaffected performances from the striking actress Monica Vitti (as a blond in L'Avventura and L'Eclisse, and as a brunette in La Notte).  L'Eclisse begins with the Vitti character's romantic breakup, and continues with her affair with a young stockbroker.  The affair is destined for failure, however, as she ultimately finds it impossible to experience meaningful contact with other people.  There are several notable sequences in the film - the dull fatigue of the opening breakup scene, raucous and frenetic scenes in the stock market, even Vitti and her friends dressing up and dancing as African natives!  The most striking for me, however, is the final several minutes, in which the lovers have agreed to meet but neither shows up, and we see a series of deserted spots (mostly locales from earlier scenes) in a mounting crescendo of emptiness and apathetic horror.  The stark and impersonal ""modern"" sixties architecture, headlines about nuclear terror, and a quietly eerie and horrific musical score combines to make this one of the most powerful sequences ever filmed.  It shocks me to learn that when originally released in America the sequence was cut as extraneous!
It's a shame that this masterpiece is currently out of print.  There are copies floating around that are dubbed from British sources, and there are also some from an American release several years ago, which had generally very good picture and subtitle quality.  I can only hope that someone, maybe Criterion, chooses to release L'Eclisse on DVD - I would give my right arm to get it!",1026777600,31,1852,5.1466666666666665

Only Truffaut, Antonioni, Kieslowski, and Wong Kar Wai could make such intelligent and emotional movies.  But going back to L'Eclisse, this movie has some interesting camera-work, it also shows Italy in the early 1960's just getting back on its feet after the WWII. Antonioni is big on showing the ever-changing and modernizing landscape, and L'Eclisse contains a lot of scenes with buildings being constructed, parks being raised, and roads being paved, this is a vital part of the movie since it connects to the story of the two young lovers who meet and...well watch and see what happens...the ending will leave you wondering for days...if not/ then you most likely did not get the message.",1384905600,2,971,4.9447852760736195
1116644,4,7560072771,"I find most of ""L'Eclisse"" to be compelling.  I don't know if I love this film--but I am fascinated by it and I admire it; Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" had a similar effect on me.  ""L'Eclisse"" starts out with Vittoria (Monica Vitti) and Riccardo (Francisco Rabal) in silence after an all-night argument in an apartment whose walls are covered with abstract and post-modern art.  The presence of art in this scene--as well as the presence of painting and sculpture in subsequent scenes--permeates this film.  Beautiful yet sterile architecture is also featured in various backdrops, to great photographic effect.  Vittoria wanders around in a dream state--brooding, giggling and teasing her mother's stockbroker Piero (Alain Delon) who is trying to get close to Vittoria, who still hasn't rebounded from Riccardo.  Vittoria sends out mixed messages about her willingness to get involved with Piero.  She repeats behaviours that she practiced with Riccardo with Piero--answering his questions with ""I don't know""; hiding by the side of her apartment window so she won't be seen when he comes to visit.  Vittoria and Piero like to meet by a certain street corner, where a building is under construction, by a corroded metal barrel filled with water, whose presence in this picture becomes practically totemic.  As another Amazon reviewer of this DVD mentioned--Vittoria resists Piero at first, but eventually gives in; the characters of Vittoria  and Claudia in ""L'Avventura"" resemble each other in certain aspects.

In contrast to ""L'Avventura"", ""L'Eclisse"" is firmly rooted in the world of the bourgeois, as opposed to L'Avventura's jet set / aristocratic milieu.  As other Amazon reviewers have noted--a glaring weakness in this picture is an overly long sequence of the noisy stock exchange.  This is the one part of the film where I found myself saying ""Enough Already !!!"" and scanned ahead on repeat viewings.  But with a director like Antonioni, indulgences such as this should be forgiven, since Antonioni has so much to offer to make up for his misfires.  Also Alain Delon gives a great performance in this film (I had previously seen Delon only in Luchino Visconti's ""Rocco and his Brothers"" and he was excellent in that too); his portrayal makes at least some of the stock exchange scenes worth watching.  Near the end of the picture, there is an indication that Vittoria's relationship with Piero may be progressing.  But we never find out, since the film ends abstractly (there is much discussion of the picture's conclusion in many other Amazon reviews of this DVD).  That being said--the picture ends well, even logically when one considers how disjointed  / fractured it can be.  There's no reason why the viewer should expect that ""L'Eclisse"" will be resolved in a linear / conventional fashion; it is the quintessential art / art house film.

After viewing ""L'Eclisse"" for the third time, more was revealed to me--emotionally as well as visually.  There are many visual clues, planted throughout the picture, that one may not recognize on first viewing this film.  The cool / clinical / Zen yet Cold War aesthetic of this picture reminds me of documentaries and educational films we watched in our elementary school auditorium as grade school students in the late 1960s; the tone of ""L'Eclisse"" also resembles that of Alain Renais' ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" (1959); both directors were ahead of their time.  ""L'Avventura"" and ""L'Eclisse"" are similar in the way they explore the themes of spiritual desolation / lack of humanity / inability to connect.  Yet another Amazon reviewer of this DVD refers to Antonioni as ""the master of silences""--and I have to agree with that description; Vittoria often doesn't even answer Piero's questions; she responds by not responding--a good technique employed by Antonioni wherein art imitates life through his dialogue.  The score by Giovanni Fusco (used sparingly as was his score for ""L'Avventura"") is dissonant, atonal and reminiscent of some aspects of the score of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""--with the exception the bubblegum-pop ""The Twist"" by Mina that opens ""L'Eclisse"" and is sampled once again in Chapter 15 of this DVD.

A woman leaves her fianc, falls for a young stockbroker, and we see
that everyone cares more about money and 'things' than human
relationships. The scenes in the stock exchange are amazingly shot, and
every frame uses architecture and framing to underline the themes of
alienation and the emptiness of modern life. Monica Vitti and Alain
Delon make the two leads more human and real than earlier Antonioni
main characters.

But a number of scenes just feel clunky, even if beautiful, and some
ideas seem overstated or over-repeated.

That said, the experimental last five minutes, which puts the themes in
a wider, more global context, is very moving and special. And to be
fair, many love this even more than I, though not with the the near
universal embrace of L'Avventura.

Note: The Criterion disc, while generally gorgeous,
has some annoying, if subtle flickering in the transfer,
confirmed as a built-in problem after some on-line research.",1297296000,,1263,5.052884615384615
1116648,3,7560072771,"For fans of fine foreign black and white film, this film is a definite must see.  Main protagonist is young woman Vittoria who is attempting to ""re-arrange"" her life by leaving her fiancee in attempt to find something more meaningful in her life.  She is leaving a seemingly independent life as a professional translator.  Her mother is a widow who spends her days at the Rome's Stock Exchange buying and selling stock.  Their apartment(s) have beautiful furnishings and their friends seem to be well of and cultured. It spite of it all there seems to be emptiness in each one of their lives.  This emptiness is both emotional and tribeless if I can use that word.

Incidentally, in her attmept to seek new beginning and hope,Vittoria starts love affair with her mother's stockbroker Piero (played by Alain Dellon). Piero is handsome, young, always quick on his feet.  But he is also shallow.  He fills his life with things (such as expensive cars) and when there is no love, he buys one off the street.

It is amazing to watch on the big screen these two beautiful people and witnes their inability to connect in any possible way.  Once seen, this film gives a whole new meaning to the word alienation.",1285718400,6,1203,4.685714285714286
1116649,4,7560072771,"Antonioni uses silence and stillness like a painter uses `white space' or a musician uses the monotone or fermata. The object of the shot--a building or a beautiful actress, for example--is motionless, but becomes familiar and intimate through the audience's own imagination. Once there is action, therefore, each slight movement is amplified because of the sparseness. One hears the words as if they are whispered from an inch away; one feels the cloth of Vittoria's dress as it shifts across her curves. The filmmaker's ability to make the audience hypersensitive is a rare feat in cinema, and one that will likely be missed by modern filmgoers whose taste is for the flash and fury. Meanwhile, those seeking a more engaging experience will find a true gem in this newly released DVD.",1282953600,2,786,5.00763358778626
1116650,4,7560072771,"Michaelangelo Antonioni's 1962 film L'ECCLISE is the third in the auteur's loose trilogy of the early Sixties, similar to L'AVVENTURA and LA NOTTE in speaking eliptically of modern Man's alienation and starting Monica Vitti. The plot of L'ECCLISE is fairly simple: the translator Vittoria (Monica Vitti) leaves her lover Riccardo (Francisco Rabal), begins a romance with the dashing young stockbroker Piero (Alain Delon), and then after a tumultuous relationship the couple seemingly fail to meet up at their accustomed time and place.

Since the plot is so simple, the film generally runs on atmosphere, the long shots that Antonioni was famous for and Vitti's smashing beauty. This is a film that I enjoyed, but I find it less than a masterpiece, because unlike the best of auteur cinema it doesn't leave be asking the big questions. The problem is Monica Vitti. While there are references here to the Cold War, the downsides of capitalism and the impersonality of modern architecture, all these musings are diminished by her sheer screen presence where she simply stands before the scene, and by her charming but lightly annoying figeting when she confronts her lovers.

Still, even if the message is weakened, there are some gorgeously constructed scenes here, such as the madness at a stock exchange as the market crashes, and the devastating ending where we watch the busy city oblivious to the absence of Vittoria and Piero. My four-star review reflects my own mixed feelings, but I do suppose that some cinephiles will rate this higher and I still recommend it to fans of art films.

The Criterion Collection edition of the film on two discs is quite good. The first disc is the film itself in a truly great print, one of the clearest in my collection of classic films. The second disc has two documentaries. Sandro Lai's ""The Eye that Changed Cinema"", produced in 2001, is an hour-long retrospective on the whole of Antonioni's achievement, from his documentary beginnings in the 1950s until the opening of his museum in the mid-1990s. Much of the points made here will be familiar to fans of Antonioni's major films, but the look back at Antonioni's making of a documentary on Maoist China is an interesting aside in his career. ""Elements of Landscape"" is a 20-minute interview with critic Adriano Apra and collaborator Carlo di Carlo on L'ECLISSE, prepared exclusively for the Criterion Collection.",1275091200,,2409,5.032581453634085
1116651,5,7560072771,"I found this film amazing. Beneath the hedonism and consumerism of modern Italian life there is an austerity of vision and a movement towards abstraction. This is Antonioni at his peak,the black and white period. Monica Vitti has never been better in her exploring the traces of the aftermath of love when she hooks up with the impulsive Delon character.the framing of the shots, the beauty of the cinematography,the use of architecture,the movement from activity to stasis and the marvellous silent ten minute ending,suggestive of apocalypse. Superb end to a great trilogy of films(see).In a world of chaos we have geometry,whether of architecture or of framing a shot,In a world without a relationship to past or present,narrative or nature,we get an immense visual stylisation. There is no story,but a visual metaphor for alienation and silence. Words drain out of the film into an empty barrel,leaving beauty and terror.",1272326400,2,924,5.25
1116652,4,7560072771,"""L'Eclisse""(1962) is part three of Antonioni's loose trilogy about love and alienation, which followed ""L'Avventura"" and ""La Notte"". Vittoria (Monica Vitti) breaks off an affair with a writer, Riccardo (Francisco Rabal), and begins a summer romance with an energetic young stockbroker, Piero (Alain Delon). This movie has little in the way of a plot and drifts about just as Vittoria seems to drift as she is searching for something but she knows not what it is. ""spoiler alert"" The last seven minutes or so of the movie is perhaps the most intriguing part of the movie as mysteriously the characters never reappear again as both seem to fail to meet for an agreed upon meeting at 8pm on September 10, 1961 at the corner of Viale del Ciclismo and Viale della Technica. Instead, we get snippets of the relatively quiet, barren, and empty street activity as the day winds down, with haunting truncated shots of people who seem to inhabit the empty spaces like mannequins, or lost souls, posed perhaps for some sort of transformation as the sun sets. The last shot is a ambiguous shot of a blazing street lamp that looks a great deal like an eclipse. The passion of the two lovers seems to have passed as the eclipse of feelings represents the transitory nature of love in the modern world, a love that Vittoria is still searching for.

This film has a science fiction quality to it. At the beginning we see the strange, futuristic, mushroom shaped, architectural building, and the people themselves often seemed poised and alien like. Lacking the full range of emotion the people could easily be something out of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""(1955), or ""The Stepford Wifes""(1975). The eerie music and abandoned street scenes are reminiscent of end of the world scenarios. Stanely Kubrick has mentioned that ""La Notte"" was one of his top ten favourite films though ""L'Eclisse"" seems to have had a larger influence of his work when one compares this film to something like his movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with its desolate, abstract, modern spaces, and bland, emotionally empty characters, who are playing out scenes that have little drama, as everything winds out slowly and effortlessly, going nowhere quickly.

This is a newly restored high definition digital transfer of the movie which has also had the audio cleaned up. A second disc contains a 56 minute documentary (""The Eye That Changed Cinema"") about Antonioni's film career and life, as well as ""Elements of Landscape"", which is a new, 22 minute film about Antonioni and the movie, ""L'Eclisse"", featuring the film critic Adriano Apra, and Antonioni's longtime friend, Carlo de Carlo. Also included is a 32 page booklet featuring numerous essays and excerpts from Antonioni's own writings.

1116653,5,7560072771,"In 1962, Michelangelo Antonioni (who has earned the nickname ""the Master of Alienation"") released his third film of a trilogy titled L'Eclisse (also known as ""The Eclipse"").

The Italian modernist director was known for his radical new style, not following any convention of filmmaking and most of all, characters and events are disconnected.  The first part of the trilogy ""L'avventura"" (1960) was an international success and would introduce the world to the actress Monica Vitti, a woman who would appear as the main character in several of his films.  Antonioni returned with ""La Notte"" (1961) starring Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni which focused on the slow death of a marriage and final of the trilogy ""L'Eclisse"" would focus on the alienation of man in the modern world.

Known for his long takes but artistically capturing the surroundings of a location, Antonioni's ""L'Eclisse"" was a winner of the Jury Special Prize at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival and nominated for the Palme d'Or. Needless to say, when watching Antonioni's films, these are films that are not your typical films and therefore was either applauded or booed.  ""L'Eclisse"" is a big example of a film which you watch without expectation and you just take in the acting, the cinematography and then you think afterward, what Antonioni was trying to accomplish.  In this case, a disconnect with love.

L'Eclisse is about a woman named Vittoria (played by Monia Vitti).  A woman who has broken off a relationship with novelist Riccardo (Francisco Rabal).  We see through their time together that she is frustrated and has had enough, while for him, he is not emotionally attached to her but probably a man who just enjoys the sex.  There is no emotional attachment to this relationship and literally their love has run dry.

Needless to say, that she leaves him and goes to visit her mother at the Rome Stock Exchange and similar to her relationship, mother and daughter's relationship seems quite dry.  Her mother seems more interesting in making money and making sure her young stockbroker Piero (played by Alain Delon) makes money.  And as far as Piero is concern, he has his eyes on his client's daughter....Vittoria.

But can these two disconnected characters find love within one another?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""L'Eclisse"" is presented in 1:85:1 aspect ratio in black and white.  According to Criterion, this new, high-definition digital transfer was created ona Spirit Datacine from two 35mm composite fine-grain master positives.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.  The picture quality is very well-done.  Blacks are nice and deep, there is dust and scratches that can be seen but for the most part, this is the best the film has ever looked.  With that being said, I did look into the flickering issue that some people have complained about and when watching it on a 52' about 10 ft. away, I didn't notice it at all.  Although, watching it on a 24' about  two feet away, then I noticed it.  So, I would assume that it comes down to your viewing distance and your viewing source.

As for audio, audio is presented in monaural and according to Criterion, the audio was mastered at 24-bit from various 35mm optical track prints and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0 and is center channel driven but for those with modern home theater receivers will probably enjoy the film more if you direct audio to all channels (which was my preference).

Audio is in Italian with English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""L'Eclisse"" has features on two DVD's.  The following special features are included:

  * Audio Commentary - On disc one, there is audio commentary by Richard Pena (the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York).  Pena is very well-versed with Antonioni's work and does a good job of explaining his thoughts of what Antonioni is trying to project with each scene and action.
  * Michelangelo Antonioni: The Eye that changed Cinema - (55:47) A documentary on disc two focusing on the life and career of Michelangelo Antonioni.  A look at the various movies he has directed, the talent he worked with and also some scenes that were not used in previous films.  We get to see various interviews with Antonioni, various talent and also, Michelangelo Antonioni accepting major awards from various awards shows.
  * Elements of a Landscape -  (21:58) A featurette on disc two from 2004 about Michelangelo Antonioni and the film L'Eclisse featuring Italian film critic and scholar Adriano Apra and Atonioni's longtime friend Carlo di Carlo.
  * 32-page Booklet - The booklet features the following essays: ""A Vigilance of Desire: Antonioni's L'Eclisse"" by author Jonathan Rosenbaum, ""Antonioni and Vitti"" by Gilberto Perez (professor of film studies at Sarah Lawrence College and also an author) and an excerpt from a spring 1962 issue of ""Film Culture"" by Antonioni titled ""Making a Film is My Way of Life"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""L'Eclisse"" is one of those films in which a viewer can definitely watch and each person probably can come up with a different answer or something similar to what another person is thinking.

For me, Vittoria is a woman who has dated far too many men who have not had this emotional attachment to her.  She's a beautiful woman but deep inside, she's emotionless.  Why?  One can go deeper and think, who are the men in her life?  Where is her father?  How has she been treated?  And is she suspicious of men that try to get close to her?  And why is she emotionally detached?  There are very few moments in the film where see Vittoria smile and relaxed.  May it be a scene where she becomes an African native and just dances and has fun, another scene where she just watches a plane coming down for a landing or a scene where she sees a dog and just laughs.  Perhaps what we are seeing is Vittoria wanting to be in another place but now.  Where her life is hearing about her mother want money, seeing men who talk about money, have material things and look at her as only as a plaything.

As for Pioro, he is a cocky stockbroker who has made a lot of money in his career and is attracted to Vittoria.  But similar to Vittoria, he is also somewhat emotionally detached as we see in one scene, a drunkard steals his nice convertible and he doesn't seem that all bothered by it.  It seems as if he is hoping he can get lucky with Vittoria more than anything.  In fact, when police find his car in a river bank with the dead drunkard inside, not once does he show any emotion towards the man who died in his car, all he can think about is selling it and buying a new car.

But it goes far beyond these two characters, for example at the Rome Stock Exchange, we see the stock brokers in frenzy and then taking a moment of silence of a death of their colleague and then back again to their way of life.  This is similar to Vittoria where we see her at rare times leaving her state of coldness and we get a glimpse of happiness.

And then the character of Marta, a new friend of Vittoria and a woman who is from Italy but was raised in Kenya and now back in Italy and feels disconnected.  Her home features pictures and relics from Kenya as if  she truly misses the environment but not the people but not the people at all (in fact, she makes fun of them) and sees herself living a life in Kenya with importance. But now back home, she is now a person who has lost that feeling of importance and feels uncomfortable.

Antonioni's ""L'Eclisse"" is a film about disconnection and similar to his previous two films, a person's view of this detachment can be seen be applauded because we rarely see all characters in a film portrayed in this manner or because of that, one can be disenchanted by it.  What I enjoyed about ""L'Eclisse"" is that there are fragments placed within the storyline that is made for people to think.  May it be the Rome stock market or the architecture of Rome in the background or how the lamp lights look artistic during the night.  But also,  how Atonioni defies normalcy, defies closure and presents his film the way he wants to without following the rules that most filmmakers go by.  It's somewhat of a rebellious film but it fits within the confines of his trilogy on modern malaise.

There is so much too appreciate about ""L'Eclisse"" and needless to say, it all comes down to the viewer and what they are able to appreciate.  If one is thinking this will be your typical romantic film, those who have not seen an Antonioni film or L'avventura or La Notte are going to quickly learn that L'Eclisse is far from what they may expect.

Overall, ""L'Eclisse"" is another wonderful release from The Criterion Collection as it really does a great job of featuring Michelangelo Antonioni's work and is highly recommended!",1261440000,,8909,4.718446601941747

Wabi-sabi is a Japanese approach to art that finds beauty and acceptance in imperfection.  It made for an amazing connection and drew out elements in the film that would have passed by my Western-oriented eyes.  For example, in addition to the film --intentionally or not -- showing wabi-sabi in objects and physical details, at one point the character played by Monica Vitti also highlights the approach when she follows a man out of curiosity who had just lost millions in the stock market.  She picks up a piece of paper the man had been writing on that he leaves at an outdoor cafe to discover he was just doodling flowers.  She says to her mother's stockbroker after finding out her mother also tanked big that day ""I have to go find my mother. She's not one to sit and draw flowers!""  The film met with a postive public and critical acceptance when it first came out in Japan. I  think this book helps explain why.  Koren has a section where he directly contrasts modernism and wabi-sabi and it's fascinating to see that played out in this beautifully haunting film.",1260316800,,1385,5.5

1116656,5,7560072771,"This film rates five stars almost inspite of its snail's pace and lack of narrative development. It does so because the film is implicitly about the deconstruction of typical film narrative techniques. Take the brilliant opening sequence, for instance. A man and a woman in a lamplit room. You'd assume its evening, but then the woman walks over to the window and draws back the curtain a bit, and its daytime and raining. And it goes from there, the film constantly revealing things that are contrary from what you'd assume according to traditional narrative techniques, e.g., establishing shots or voice-overs or dialogue that reveals information about characters. Antonioni is showing us the falsity of all these techniques by forcefully abandoning them. The conclusion of the film is equally brilliant, almost as if the camera had misunderstood the characters, who agree to meet at 8pm at ""the usual place."" We go to where we assume that ""usual place"" is, but they never show. It's really a great joke on filmmaking, given a foreboding twist by the hint of nuclear holocaust. It echoes the mushroom clowd-like image of the water tower glimpsed rather jarringly during the opening sequence. For Antonioni, it's a fine poetic device symbolising the destructiveness of human relations. In between these sequences, L'Eclisse tries your patience, but it continually makes brilliant use of interior spaces and audience assumptions about what's going on. It colours your view of all other film narratives and their devices, and therein lies it greatness.",1242518400,2,1551,5.208
1116657,3,7560072771,"Alright, so I've stewed this over for a few days and I have to say that my initial reaction to this film has not really changed all that much.  I'm not as furious now as I was then so I think that I can manage writing a `fair' review, even if half the people who have already posted here are going to hate me for it.  The thing is, I absolutely loved `La Notte' and so I was really, really looking forward to this movie.  It's right up my ally if you know what I mean.  I love slow, brooding character studies so `L'Eclisse' just looked like the type of film I would go crazy over.

I did go crazy, but not in a good way.

The film tells the story (if it can be called that) of young Vittoria who has recently (as in, opening scene `recently') split up with her fianc&eacute;, feeling the need for something more in her life.  She sparks a chemistry with Piero, a young and energetic stock broker who is instantly smitten with her.  Their values are different though, and his apparent materialism is standing in the way of their relationship.

Ok, so here is my issue.  The film's pacing is really bad.  There are long drawn out scenes taking place within Piero's crazy world, and honestly it is just not interesting to watch a bunch of people run around screaming about stocks.  It doesn't add anything to the story that couldn't be told and confirmed in a few short scenes.  These scenes just seem to go on forever.  Sure, one can say they are to establish Piero's lifestyle and his mindset, but like I said; a few well written and well directed sequences could have summed that up in less than half the time.  The next issue I have is with the films ending, which I felt was very out of place.  I'm going to use a word that I LOATHE so please don't hold this against me.  The ending is far too `artsy' for its own good.  Before you hounds attack, hear me out.  I love art house films, seriously.  Read through my reviews and you'll see that.  The issue that I have with this films ending is that is takes the `art' factor too far.  The film is already brazenly art house, so when those final frames roll around and every goes up a notch it seems very, very out of place.

Personally, when the film ending I said aloud ""this is the dumbest movie I've ever seen"", but it is not, and to be honest, if the stock broker scenes were cut (they really take away from the rest of the film) and the ending was cut (it still irks me) then I would be raving this movie right now.  The bulk of the film is very good and the acting is mostly sublime.  I adored Monica Vitti's small scenes in `La Notte' and so I was anxious to see her here.  I found her mostly engaging and vibrant.  A few scenes seemed rather bland from her, but very few.  Alain Delon was amazing in this film, full of life and he emoted so well.  I was glued to him, even during those horrendous stock broker scenes.  He brings such dynamic energy to his roles.

So, I hate to say it, but I cannot really recommend this movie.  I know that it may seem like a weird preference, but I truly love `La Notte' yet I can't even really admire `L'Eclisse'.  I know that a lot of reviewers found `La Notte' boring or pretentious but I found it perfectly restrained and brutally honest.  `L'Eclisse' has hints of that honesty and it had the potential to be just as effective, but some strange directorial decisions and some excessive scripting cost it that perfection.",1241481600,5,3417,4.271028037383178
1116658,4,7560072771,"Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Eclisse (The Eclipse), his 1962 black and white capstone of his Alienation Trilogy that began with L'Avventura and continued with La Notte, is arguably a great film, but still a cut or two  below its immediate predecessor, the indisputably brilliant La Notte, simply because it lacks the story and excellent portrayal of a human relationship that that earlier film has. It is, however, a superior film to L'Avventura, in that its sustains it sublime weirdness and disaffecting qualities throughout the film, whereas that first film in the trilogy petered out into a dull ending after an intriguing and mysterious premise.
  This 125 minute film does not suffer from that ill, and is certainly the most Antonionian of the three films, in that it contains the trademark bizarreness of his soundtrack mixed with the runic symbolism and bizarre framing of shots that achieves the effect of alienation perfectly, if also subliminally. While it lacks the natural visual splendor of L'Avventura and the emotional drive of La Notte, this film never quite falls into predictability, even though it seems to dare the viewer into believing it will, and that it is really a love story. In truth, the film is an anti-love story, for it follows its lead character, Vittoria (MonicaVitti), a translator of literature, from the end of one shallow and passionless love affair, with a writer named Riccardo (Francisco Rabal), at the film's beginning, through the start and abrupt end of another shallow and passionless affair, with a stockbroker named Piero (Alain Delon), and then simply discards her as easily as she tosses away her lovers, and ends with a visual essay of sorts, on the terminal state of modern existence. Vittoria embodies this emotional anomy when she laments to Piero, in the few minutes that we see the true start and end of their affair, that she wished she didn't love him at all, or loved him much more. Then the film spends almost ten minutes in that essay, pulling us out of the world that its lead characters have familiarized ourselves with, as if to state that their lives were only randomly eavesdropped upon, and that the film could have easily turned its dispassionate eye upon any of the characters, mundane and bizarre, that we see shambling through its Roman suburban streets.
  There is a sense that all of the inhabitants of this end world are zombies, of a sort, and it is not without a sense of the zeitgeist of the times that during the same year, 1962, that this film was released, over in America, a B film classic with eerily similar imagery and an even more haunting soundtrack, was released. That film was industrial filmmaker and documentarian (just as Antonioni started out as a documenatarian) Herk Harvey's lone fictional film, the brilliant low budget horror film Carnival Of Souls, in which the tale opens with a drag race that has one car crash over the side of a bridge. Its one survivor, a thin, pretty, but disoriented, blond, who has an aversion to the shallow male of the species, wanders cross-country and is haunted by bizarre beings that chase her, even as no one else is aware of them. Eventually, she is destroyed by them, and it is revealed that her dead body is still in the car, that is dredged up from the river, at film's end. Antonioni has a similar scene in his film, although earlier in his film, where a corpse is recovered from Piero's car, after it has plunged into a river when a drunk steals it. Harvey's film had a profound impact on the subsequent mythos of George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead, and its many sequel and imitators, as did another American B horror film, made in 1964, adapted from Richard Matheson's sci fi-horror novel I Am Legend. That was the classic Vincent Price vampiric bio-terror chiller The Last Man On Earth, whose imagery of deserted and blanched out urban streets are the closest things to an Antonionian vision American film, A or B, has produced. The end of Antonioni' film has such a strong affinity with those films that it is no wonder that many critics consider his cinematic world not to be a portrayal of our own real world, but some odd universe just next door. And, there are many moments one could imagine the then current The Twilight Zone hoist, Rod Serling, emerging from beneath some enigmatic piece of architecture, and declaiming on the angst of this film's characters.... All in all, the whole film does not proceed in a linear fashion, but this is its grace note, for it sidles forth, like a sidewinder, or perhaps, even more tellingly, like a crab, herkily and jerkily, yet lulling and luring the viewer into its odd dance, which is, what I would call `the theater of disaffection', which is one that may have not been founded by Antonioni, for Ingmar Bergman's films pioneered that milieu first, but is the one which Antonioni most definitely made his own. Would that such presumption would reign again in the arts, and we would not have the likes of the people who list through this film's end currently deciding who gets published and lauded or what good young independent filmmaker gets good distribution. Here, again, the film is its own plaint's answer. I would tell you more but then this essay might not end so-",1221350400,2,5259,4.793825799338478

We also get some lively scenes from the stock exchange in Rome which are very exciting. The pace of the film is slow with long takes and not much dialogue - if you want action and a clear plot and message this is not for you! What L'Eclisse is really about can of course be discussed: is it about hopeless love, about alienation in modern society, or about the problems of human communication and contact, and so on?

1116660,5,7560072771,"**Spoilers**

L'Eclisse is essentially a love story, or at least an almost love story. Both lead actors are highly attractive and very little real conflict exists to keep them apart. Antonioni could have chosen more mundane circumstances if he simply wished to express the dullness of everyday life, or a lack of passion, or an inability to connect. Instead we are given two vibrant characters, the gorgeous blonde Vittoria, who dances and plays with dogs and laughs at drunkards, and the handsome Pierro, who works his way into a successful position in the busy world of the stock market. The characters themselves are not lacking in life or vitality. The world they exist in, however, seems to numb all passion. The streets are bare, filled with buildings rather than people, dirt rather than flowers. The passion seems to drain in the same way the rain-barrel drains at the end of the movie, dissipating into the city and becoming nothing. It seems to say, life itself has lost its vibrancy, its point. Even the stock market, the bustling center of commerce, is pointless. The shouts and phone calls never amount to anything. Antonioni gives us twenty minutes to watch this bustle, which is initially exciting, but eventually becomes mundane, like watching a trail of ants. Vittoria follows a man who has lost millions in the stock market to a caf and finds that he has drawn flowers on his napkin. Not even such a loss really matters. There is a horrible inability to connect to this world. It is utterly distant from the people it contains.

The entire film is summarized in the first scene of the movie. It is a break up scene and one might expect cries or yelling, but no passion is to be found. Vittoria wanders aimlessly, rearranging the apartment. She holds up a frame, moving the objects behind it as though if she could get them just right she might be happier. She seems to echo Antonioni, framing his characters in the film. There is an interminable restlessness about her. Her hair is constantly rustling in the wind of an electric fan. She seems to be waiting for something. Perhaps for some emotion, some sign of life. As she waits the audience waits as well. There is a collective yearning for something to happen. This restlessness continues throughout the film. In the stock market there is a moment of silence for a colleague that has passed away. Even as the brokers become quiet the telephones continue to ring. Later on, when Vittoria and Pierro are achingly close to having a true moment of passion, the doorbell rings. Vittoria leaves and Pierro's telephones resume ringing. There is a continual disquiet underlying the entire film.

Perhaps what makes this film so restless is precisely the fact that is an art film. When one is continually exposed to the world of mainstream film, one becomes used to a release, a letting go. Eventually every conflict builds and releases. In L'Eclisse the basic conflict is precisely the lack of conflict. The film becomes self-reflexive. The film raises an interesting dilemma because it seems to state that unhappiness results from nothing in particular. Perhaps life consists of long blocks of unhappiness punctuated by brief periods of happiness. But the brief moments of happiness are not brought on by miraculous outside circumstances. They escape from within the characters. The little poodle, for instance, seems to distract Vittoria from the urban world's cold restlessness. She is truly happy for a brief moment before the usurping restlessness of the city reclaims her, perfectly represented here by the alien rattling of the flagpoles in the night. We see Vittoria in the darkness from a high angle as she approaches a bronze statue. The angle suddenly reverses to show the statue from below, looming over her and emphasizing the dominance of society over little Vittoria. It seems to say, ""one day you too will be a statue."" It is not human nature to be unhappy; the city itself suppresses happiness.

As many science fiction films like Metropolis and Blade Runner use the city as a warning of technology that may get out of hand, L'Eclisse seems to say we have already come too far. The monolithic structure looming outside Riccardo's apartment seems to be a watchtower, observing the little people below it. The apartment buildings in the distance seem to tower over Vittoria as she returns to her apartment. The only reprieve from the concrete world seems to be Pierro's parents house. It is old and cluttered with things. It feels as though somebody actually lives here. Vittoria looks out the window and sees a church letting out a crowd of people. Yet even here she is distanced. She finds Pierro's room and examines a pen. It is a novelty pen with a woman on it. As she turns the pen the woman's clothing disappears. Perhaps this is the sexuality, the playfulness that has been left behind in this old house. Pierro's room is a little blander than the other rooms. The youth has moved out. Not even here can they honestly express themselves. Pierro wants to kiss Vittoria, but she will only let him when there is a pane of glass in the way. They are so close to breaking free from the confines of the city, but once again, find themselves restrained.

The closest the couple comes to a true breakthrough comes at the corner. Pierro tells Vittoria that when they get to the other side of the crosswalk he will kiss her. They start to cross, but stop midway. Perhaps the city is pulling them back once again. This insignificant moment is the film's anticlimax. They do make it to the other side, and they do kiss, but it isn't substantial. The corner is a place of construction. The city does not yet have full reign here, but it is only a matter of time. Vittoria tosses a stick into the water-barrel, perhaps to mark the spot, perhaps out of boredom. Once again she is arranging objects in the frame. She is moving things, but is never moved herself. Later on Pierro tosses his matchbook in. He as well is restless. She, with her calm life about town, and he, with is yelling at the stock market, both are lost in the pointlessness of modern life. So too is the man who drew flowers, as well as Vittoria's mother. All people are stuck in the monotony. The film ends in a montage of this restlessness. People waiting for the bus, old men, even children, all are searching, waiting. We draw to a close on the street lamp, a glowing orb in the dark. Perhaps its light was stolen from the people of the city. Perhaps it's luminance once belonged the people below. Now only the street lamp shines in the dark.
The ending is far from satisfying, but it is not meant to be. It represents the interrupted and the unfinished. It echoes a very real unhappiness that all people feel at some point in time. If mainstream cinema can be said to be entertainment, L'Eclisse is certainly not ""entertaining"" in the typical sense of the word. It shows that film can be something other than an escape from life, but a mirror of it. It is exactly the feeling of restlessness in L'Eclisse that the viewer wishes to escape. In this way L'Eclisse documents the very feeling it conveys. It reflects more than a story, it reflects human nature. It discards typical movie tropes and shows that film is more than a medium of narrative. Film is an art form that can express the human condition. It can express pure emotion without relying upon the artificial contrivances of story. It states, ""Life itself is worth watching."" In this way L'Eclisse, not only fits within the category of art film, but may also be the epitome of what art film is.

The art film is willing to break free of convention. It dares to let the audience feel bored, or uncomfortable, or upset. Its ultimate goal is not to show off actors or to distract audiences with clever screenwriting, but to express an idea. What poetry is to fiction, art film is to mainstream cinema. It is first and foremost the work of its director, an expression. It expresses emotion rather than events. In this way Antonioni's L'Eclisse is truly a masterpiece. It succinctly conveys the feeling of oppression, of frustration and of restlessness without overwhelming the viewer. There is a magnificent subtlety to the film that is rarely captured elsewhere. It is a masterful work of absurdist fiction comparable to Camus' The Stranger.

Art film may be difficult to define, but L'Eclisse brings a definition one step closer to completion. It defines itself by its stark contrast to mainstream cinema and its unconventional narrative. It expresses a terrible discordance between people and their surroundings. It reflects basic unhappiness without placing blame or overwhelming the viewer. Ultimately it places emphasis upon emotions rather than events, epitomizing what an art film can be.

Perhaps Vittoria will find happiness some day; perhaps Pierro will win his money back in the stock market. The film leaves no hints for prediction. Neither optimism nor pessimism but simply waiting... Well, we're half way there.",1206662400,3,9026,4.796272493573265
1116671,4,7560072771,"Slow, languid shots of blonde Monica Vitti as she strolls through an empty Italian marketplace. Remarkable closeups of the stunning Alain Delon. Breathtaking black and white overheads of the mesmerising Italian landscapes and Roman architecture.

This is not so much a movie as it is one beautiful postcard after another. The physical beauty of the two lead actors alone will have you enthralled. Monica Vitti (in a much better role than 'L'Avventura') plays a woman torn between two men. Alain Delon, in his day considered the most beautiful man on earth, lights up the screen and its impossible to take your eyes off the Frenchman.

When the two get together there is often no dialog, just long passages of time with silence interspersed with their breathing. Granted, this is not a film for everyone, but if you're looking to enrich your visual senses with true ITALIAN ART, then this is the film for you. True, any film that had two supermodels as their lead will be 'watchable' but here the director converts their obvious physical beauty into transcedental art, and that should not be missed.

Delon, perhaps the handsomest French film icon of all time, is winning as Piero, a confident young buck who knows how to make money at the exchange but fails to fully possess Vittoria. Beautifully stylized and ambiguous, ""L'Eclisse"" casts a chilly eye on the nature of love and attachment.",1182902400,3,650,5.575757575757576
1116673,5,7560072771,"L'Eclisse is a beautiful Italian neo-realist movie by director Michelangelo Antonioni, starring Monica Vitti as Vittoria and Alain Delon as Piero. Vittoria is a good-hearted woman who is ""halfway there"", meaning that finds herself at a point of desperately needed change. She can't see how a change would add meaning to her life, but she shows interest about all that surrounds her, and is willing to try new and eccentric things (like flying over Rome one afternoon or dressing up as a Somali woman) that ultimately prove to be empty of meaning. At the beginning we witness her separation from her fianc, who was not a thrill to her either.

Piero is a hyperkinetic stocks runner, Vittoria's mother being a client, whose job demands absolute concentration, time, and iron people skills. Even though he never stops moving and jumping around, he also proves to be unable to see much meaning in life.

The two meet and fall in love, beginning a torrid romance, but even though they are with each other most of the time, be it playing or going for a walk, they hardly ever speak about anything and they seem to each have a large percentage of their thoughts devoted to scrutinizing every single thing, perhaps not for fun but to find significance in them; they are constantly laughing and smiling at little things, trying to be creative and break the routine, but Vittoria does not even consider the idea of making theirs a long-term relationship because she sees nothing to it: ""I wish I didn't love you, or loved you much more"", she says. She finds everything ""halfway there"", nothing is intense or dramatic enough to have real relevance.

Vittoria is Antonioni's existential heroine. She has a sort of innate elegance, a sort of abandon to her gestures and her contagious laughter, but she is able to adapt her face to the situation into a shyly desperate expression. Piero is constantly on the run and usually very cruel, but is unable to mistreat Vittoria at all. It is never clear if they like each other because they recognize their nihilism in the other's personality, but I sensed it so. They are so caught up in their own labyrinths that they become physically and emotionally dependent of the other: the reflection in the mirror.

The film ends quite abruptly as Vittoria and Piero set a date for the evening after a long embrace that could very easily mean ""good-bye"", but regardless of whether they continue their relationship it is not meant to last. With so similar an outlook of the value of daily life, they would most likely evolve to become nihilistic about each other.

On the more technical side, the film is a photographic masterpiece. Every frame looks like a carefully designed picture, every single one is priceless. Monica Vitti's performance is very endearing because she is not an ice maiden and she is not a silly bimbo, she's a credible good-natured woman in a difficult situation. Alain Delon is also remarkably charming (and repulsive at times) as Piero. The film itself is full of music and beautiful, albeit usually lonely, scenarios of Rome, and even though it exceeds 160 minutes, I found it hypnotizing enough not to realize the passing of time.",1178928000,3,3179,4.815018315018315

1116675,5,7560072771,"A young free-lance translator breaks up with her fianc after an incommunicative night. She goes to the stock market, seeking comfort from her mother who is preoccupied with her stock trading; however, she meets her mother's young stockbroker. She next has the following experiences: a carefree girl's night, flight through clouds in an airplane, and the openness of a small airport environment. The stock market crashes, causing financial hardships, and her mother becomes more concerned with her stock losses than her daughter's well being. The stockbroker takes the young woman to his parents' house while no one is at home. The couple approaches and withdraws, and eventually becomes intimate. Post-intimacy conversation reveals their lack of understanding of each other. Office sex ensues, and the couple decides to see each other forever, and to meet again that night. There is an eclipse that night.

 The theme of this film is the alienation that leads two self-absorbed, affluent young people to create a superficial and dependant love relationship in the context of materialism and parental neglect.

 This theme is supported by the use of the elements of film style. Dialogue gives us contrastive language between the two people which reveals how little they know of themselves and each other. ""I feel like I'm in a foreign land,"" Pierro says to Vittoria. ""You make me feel the same. How strange,"" she replies. This dialogue tells the audience that this couple, though physically intimate, is not emotionally connected, cluing us into the superficiality of their relationship and their self-absorption. Action shows us Pierro and Vittoria kissing through the glass pane of the cabinet door. This suggests to the viewer their physical longing for one another while reinforcing their disconnectedness. Composition places the couple on the edge of frames and at crosswords. These displays make the audience feel tense, lonely and precarious. This use of composition relates to the theme in that it makes the audience feel the lack of insight that Vittoria and Pierro suffer from. The fast cuts within the editing of the stock market scene emphasize the animalistic nature of the stock market, making the audience feel entranced and frightened. The materialism aspect of the theme is shown through this editing scene. The musical score and various sound effects create contrasts of anxiety, calmness, and desolation which put the feeling of alienation into the viewer.

 This film is ultimately valuable today because its theme is inescapable. From the time that Antonioni created L'Eclisse, the world has grown no less materialistic and healthy relationships have grown no less dependent upon a strong sense of self and understanding of others. Although the alienation of the young people was caused by the threat of nuclear war, financial struggle and parental neglect of 1960's Italy, similar political, financial and familial instabilities can cause similar feelings among the youth of today. Technology continues to progress, and with it, one could easily argue, human communication declines. L'Eclisse argues that awareness of self and of the external motivations for personal desires is necessary for healthy relationships in such an environment. This awareness entails intense understanding of emotion: the human factor that connects us even in states of desolation and loneliness. Antonioni wrote of the film, ""All I am capable of thinking is that during an eclipse even feelings probably come to a halt."" Thus the eclipse is the connecting factor for the alienated characters of the film, proving at least that, by existing together, we are capable of union. Antonioni portrays what critic `Hawk' of Variety Magazine referred to as the ""eclipse of sentiments"" masterfully in the final ten minutes of the film.  The final montage is dominated by a slow movement from images of crossroads, a construction site, Vittoria's apartment building, and various unknown faces: all people, places, and things that have witnessed the development of Vittoria and Pierro's relationship. This montage ultimately creates ""a sensation which defines the film"" by relating seemingly unrelated things, proving the connectedness of life even within the context of L'Eclisse.

 As is to be expected with an extreme artistic endeavor such as L'Eclisse, the film received mixed reviews. While Hollis Alpert of the Saturday Review commends Antonioni's masterful use of cinematic style, he complains that Vittoria and Pierro's emotions ""have become so vitiated that we cannot help but wonder why we are to be so concerned about them."" That is one of the primary concerns of the film, however: the understanding of what context leads to such impaired emotions and what comes of them. An unknown critic for Time similarly complains that Antonioni's ""pessimism"" is ""sick"" and ""nave."" There is hope even within a world that loves money, and ""evil is not the dominant quality of modern life,"" this critic claims. One fails to understand exactly which film this critic was watching. To have missed the hope that Antonioni layered into L'Eclisse is astonishing. Even if the musical score and dialogue were taken away, one could not watch the beautiful sequence of image and montage without feeling both the struggle and the immense hope. Other critics, such as Bosley Crowther (The N. Y. Times) and ""Hawk"" of Variety Magazine attained a greater grasp of Antonioni's ""eclipse of sentiments"" and the context which drove the characters to their low state and the audience to its revelation. ""Modern society and the money which commands it are turning man into an object... unable to maintain normal relationships,"" says ""Hawk."" Thus, he says, the eclipse metaphor works on several levels, emphasizing both the eclipsing effect of materialism and displaced emotion, as well as the veil of human connectedness that ends the movie.",1178323200,2,5908,5.303418803418803
1116676,5,7560072771,"This review may contain spoilers.

I say this is a film. L'Eclisse can easily be described: Desolation married with beauty. Absolutely. Though this four-lettered description of Antonioni's masterpiece is appropriate (on some level), it will never say enough. It is the details. The small things, you know, that make this haunting display of isolation transpire into its own dimension of aesthetics. This film should initially be viewed for its unconventional techniques. But is also remarkably enjoyable on a simpler level with humor placed sporadically and wonderfully throughout. Ultimately, though, the film's focus is the destructiveness of the modern world.

The cinematography of the landscape. It is fresh and crisp. Its breadth is spectacular. Antonioni leads the scenery into the foreground. To an exalting and resplendent effect. The vacuous setting superimposes the characters and belittles them from every facet. Monica Vitti is perfection. Oh, rather. Visually fragrant to the point that her screen presence draws you into her spellbinding ""loneliness."" Vitti's Vittoria constantly feels the world through her fingertips. Attempts a physical connection to her surroundings. Yet, her environment is lifeless and barren. Her relationships the same. The men Vittoria sees are emotionally inert.

We start off with the end of Vittoria's relationship with Riccardo (Francisco Rabal). Riccardo stares off into nothing here and there. Vittoria trying to feel a connection with anything as she wanders around the room. She leaves finally. She later meets Alain Delon's Piero, a materialistic stock broker that is also void of any real emotions reserved for the love Vittoria is seeking. His love is for money. While she has a relationship with Piero, it is an empty affair. One simply for convenience in the end. Although the ending is seemingly a short art-house film for the sake of innovative elegance (and leaves Vittoria and Piero's realtionship to speculation), it is magnificent.

Like Alain Resnais' films, L'Eclisse is tantamount only to itself. And is appreciated, perhaps, by only those with an affinity for cinematic high-end art. For that is what it is. And that is why I love it.",1174780800,4,2198,5.399416909620991
1116677,4,7560072771,"Antonioni's masterpiece of the Italian post-war generation may be the best delineation of mid-century cultural shock ever set to film (next to Blow-Up).

Monica Vitti, resembling a Modigliani painting, wanders around a house filled with ancient art on the walls at the beginning of the film. Her restlessness is representative of the new generation's dissatisfaction with the old world.  Restlessness giving way to transition is a key point in the film.

""You never stay still"", Monica Vitti complains to Alain Delon at one point in the film, yet  it's she who wanders endlessly from room to room, house to house, even flying in a plane at one point in the film and changing her skin color in another scene. She may be the first ADD character ever portrayed on film. Everything in fact, is in a state of running away: Delon's sports car into a lake, a balloon surrendered to an endless sky, even objects can't stay still.

Conforming to the title of the film, Vitti is mostly seen dressed in white with her pretty blonde hair, alternately enveloping and escaping from Alain Delon, always dressed in a black suit with his black hair. The differing shades are always competing for dominance, sometimes lunar, sometimes solar.

At the end of ""L'Eclisse"" Antonioni shows a bleak, empty urban street preparing for what may or may not be a nuclear explosion. The question begs in the final shot, are we looking at the A-bomb or an overwhelmingly bright light bulb?

1116680,5,7560072771,"From dictionary.com:

Eclipse--1. The partial or complete obscuring, relative to a designated observer, of one celestial body by another. 2. The period of time during which such an obscuration occurs. 3.  A temporary or permanent dimming or cutting off of light.  4. A fall into obscurity or disuse; a decline.  5. A disgraceful or humiliating end; a downfall.

Montage and composition are among the many different ways to fashion a film, but this film takes those techniques and controls it to such a consummate level, it seems no similar attempt can be done again without it being a pale comparison.

Right from the beginning the idea of ""eclipse"" and bodies or objects obscuring other bodies or objects is used to a major degree, but with a such precise control over monochromatic black-and-white gradient scheme that each individual composition is powerfully effective.  The frame-within-a-frame technique, where everything in the world of this film exists in some form of composition or balance, has no parallel, except maybe with some of the modern day work by Wes Anderson... except Wes Anderson's sometimes pastel, sometimes bright color provides an entirely different effect.  This movie gives off a degree of science fiction, with such utter significance to framing and blocking off things towards the idea of obscurity that it doesn't seem to exist in our world, a world where we move aside to get out of the way, or focus on infinite planes of existence rather than many.

Not all the film is like this, of course, because we do have a story, and the story is about the ultimately doomed relationship of a stock market broker and a young woman who only fits in with the world of perpindicular obscured objects.  The stock market is chaotic and insane, and only follows composition when the girl is around.  The symbolism is beyond obvious, it hits you over the head with a wooden mallet--which is probably one of the reasons why some people might not like this, because it's very uncomfortable and impatient to watch.

Still, if you want to avoid becoming impatient and edgy around this film, my suggestion to you would be to turn off the sound and subtitles (if necessary).  The fact of the matter is that the only dialog that matters is disregarded (purposefully) by the characters and all the poignant questions and exchanges are ignored or unanswered.  This movie, in fact, could benefit a lot with a little LESS plot than it currently has, because the plot itself seems to get in the way of the majesty of the filmmaking proper.

Not that the plot isn't important.  It's just uncomfortable.  What's amazing about it, really, is that the from the woman's perspective, the world of strict order and composition is amazingly comfortable, but the desire to develop comes from the man, who's world is always moving and unbalanced.  So while the ultimate goal of the plot is about breaking down such composition (success being comedy and failure being tragedy), it's difficult to imagine the goal of the character impinging on the harmony the spectator enjoys.  What, precisely, are we supposed to get from this anyway?

That's ""the thing.""  The plot obscures the overall theme of the movie, a theme dealing with emptiness and fear of potential doomsday (the Cold War).  And once said obscured object becomes the focus of the camera, suddenly the plot is obscured itself.  This film is absolutely amazingly structured, though in a way that seems rather confusing because our technical expectations have us leaning more towards figuring out what the plot, dialog, and characters mean, not what they're completely distracting us from.  It seems a rather dangerous approach to filmmaking... what makes it amazing is that it works.  It's a technical achievement of consummate artistry, and that's a hard thing to say for a film that spends the majority of its time focusing on a plot one hates.

1116692,5,7560072771,"I'm captivated by Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Eclisse. There's a phrase I can't stand in modern criticism: Not for everyone. Many would apply that tired phrase to Antonioni's films and especially L'Eclisse. Is there something for everyone? I've met a few people who don't like The Beatles (my brother can definitely live without them). My friend, Kirk, once told me The Great Gatsby was badly written. I think The Godfather is overrated. Nothing is for everyone...and why shouldn't it be that way? I'm interested in mood, composition and space. When it comes to pacing, I go both ways: fast and slow. Story is important, but plot is inconsequential to me. Scratch that: Plot is downright boring to me. Throw complex characters and themes into an intriguing landscape and follow the waves of their discovery. That's the way Antonioni did it and he did it beautifully. Every shot of L'Eclisse is worthy of a still photo exhibition. And what a subject is Monica Vitti! My favorite scene in the movie, in any movie, is when she wanders about in the night and marvels over a row of flagpoles swaying in the breeze. Without any overt expressions, Vitti manages to convey a sense of alienation and wonderment. Antonioni wasn't just interested in his characters, but also the objects and world encompassing them. And what could be a truer approach? While I type this, there's me, the monitor, the keyboard, the Coca-Cola can, the desk, the window, the Webster's Dictionary, etc. These things are all important. Why should they be relegated to backdrop? L'Eclisse is filled with rich, quiet moments of Vitti's character (Vittoria) connecting and not connecting with her environment. She wanders about Rome (at times, it appears to be a post-apocalyptic Rome) and that's the story! It almost seems like a ghost story. Is Vittoria the last of the living in a ghost world? Or is Vittoria a spirit adrift? During these scenes I'm reminded of Carnival of Souls. Although L'Eclisse is strictly art-house and Carnival drive-in fare, they have much in common. Both films came out in 1962. Both films are B&W and rely on haunting images. Both have a scene of a car being pulled out of water after a fatal accident. Both have a blond, introverted protagonist that spends much screen-time wandering about in a ghostly state. Both protagonists have better luck connecting with objects than people. When Mary Henry explores the abandoned pavilion in Carnival does it not evoke Antonioni's style? Doesn't the ending of L'Eclisse, with the disconcerting absence of the main characters and an increasingly eerie score, suggest a horror film? Both Antonioni and Herk Harvey (Carnival's director and main ghoul) were schooled in documentary filmmaking. Did they both see a glimpse of the macabre behind everyday truth?",1137369600,11,2790,5.054229934924078
1116693,4,7560072771,"How can you not love this movie? Ok, so it's boring as hell, pointless, with no plot and about characters who are not even remotely interesting. Then how come this film is actually good? One word..... Antonioni. The great filmmakers have their own unique way of looking at the world and Michelangelo Antonioni's view is one of the most fascinating in all of cinema. He is really what can be called a modernist. I've always been fascinated by modern art, painting, music, literature, what have you. Cinema on the other hand has always been very predictable, highly commercial and always dealt with the most simplistic formulas to guarantee entertainment for the audience. Great filmmakers had existed before Antonioni, guys like Orson Welles, Akira Kurosawa, Sergei Eisenstein, F.W. Murnau, even that pesky Hitchcock dude. However before Antonioni, Bergman and Godard came on the scene, film had always been classical in it's disposition. All of a sudden, modernism hit cinema like a ton of bricks! I respect Bergman, I don't care too much about Godard but Antonioni is interesting because he's perhaps the weirdest and most severe of them all, so he merits attention in a sense different from the others.

L'Eclisse, ( The Eclipse ), is the last film of a loosely held together trilogy, the others being La Notte and L'Avventura. Every one of these works deals with modern malaise and discontentment, the advance of the ever changing world around us and how that world seems to deaden and isolate human beings from one another. The films show the death of love and the death of real human emotions, not artificial ones that Hollywood cinema offers us daily. You don't feel the emotions in these films because of their inclusion, you feel them because of their absence.

The Antonioni style is not depressing but it is certainly boring in the typical sense. No one raised on mainstream movies is going to respond kindly to a film like L'Eclisse. There are long shots, long pauses, long scenes where nothing happens, only later do you discover the fascinating labyrinth that Antonioni creates for you. The final 10 minutes or so of this film are amazing but can only be comprehended if you're in tune with the modern style, well, mid-20th century modernism anyway.

Alain Delon and Monica Vitti are good actors, who come to life from time to time, just as Antonioni directs them to. I was hypnotized for the majority of the film as it's unique rhythm worked on me but I don't care for the stock exchange scenes. I understand Antonioni wanted to alter the rhythm of the movie 180 degrees with these noisy scenes and he wanted to capture humanity as a bunch of money hungry vultures, everyone out for themselves, greedy to the end,( another sad state that is getting sadder in the modern world, money is more important that ever before, especially in our capitalist society ), however the Zen like state of the other parts of the film is so much more fascinating than the annoying stock market circus. So even though I understand what Antonioni is doing in the stock exchange scenes, he's showing human life in a clear, objective manner, these scenes go on far too long and destabilize the unique mood of the rest of L'Eclisse. If I was the director, I would have cut down several minutes from the stock exchange scenes.

The Criterion Collection DVD is once again a marvel, they are good at Criterion, aren't they? The picture is sharp, clean, gorgeous, the sound is top of the line. The special features contain some memorable interviews with admirers and colleagues of Antonioni. There is also a documentary spanning the entire Antonioni career, the documentary is not long but informative and Antonioni is on camera much of the time, from youth to old age. A commentary track also exists and it's a typically pompous track with a film professor, it's still quite good and you'll be let in on some of the underlining ideas you might have missed as you watched the film.

L'Eclisse is hardly my favorite movie, it's not even my favorite Antonioni movie but it's the kind of work that makes you look at the world in a new, fresh light, just like the blazing street lamp with which Antonioni ends this film. Not a masterpiece, but worthwhile nonetheless!",1136073600,5,4250,4.808481532147743

I kept it for two months the first time, watched almost all of it, but then lost patience and sent it back because there was something else I wanted to get quickly.  But I couldn't stop thinking back about it and wound up renting it again.  I'm considering just going ahead and buying it.  I still haven't figured out if I actually *like* it or not.  But I can't stop watching it.

How can a movie this cold and distant and remote be so affecting?  How can a film so full of detail and business be so cold and distant and remote?

Monica Vitti plays a stylishly unhappy woman who basically wanders around Rome, falling out of one relationship into another, with Alain Delon.  She's so wan that I often wanted to step in and shove her, but at the same time, she has an absolutely captivating presence.  Eventually, I actually stopped caring anything about the plot and just relished the endless scenes in which I could take in her long, slender nose and her slim, sleepy eyes.  Is that a intelligent reason for liking this film?  Probably not but fortunately I don't really care.",1131148800,3,1125,4.487684729064039
1116695,3,7560072771,"L'Eclisse is the thrid film in Antonioni's trilogy of isolation, and never has he made the audience feel so, well, isolated. There isn't really much plot, which is typical of an Antonioni film, and it's often why they're so appealing. However, in this film the silence becomes more self indulgent then meaningful, and the meandering style becomes tiresome. Antonioni balances both the quiet times and loud times of city life, while attempting to find love in between, but it just doesn't work well. The film is irregular, and the performances by Vitti and Delon (both great actors) feel stilted. The film has nice photography and has a very modern feel to it and Antonini's films are always interesting. L'Eclisse is not Antonioni's most ambitious film, but it is easily his most pretentious.",1128902400,4,792,5.007575757575758

It's art, high art, and only the mid-section drags, but the opening and closing sections... wow, I don't think cinema can top these.",1123372800,4,404,4.328947368421052
1116698,5,7560072771,"Few films in the story of the cinema can match with this one. Antonioni-the great master of the silences- focuses around the behavior of a lonely and disturbed woman who commences a new sentimental relation with a broker -Alain Delon- after having broken a previous love engagement.
The reading and the final analysis about her loneliness with the huge frame of Rome make of this film one of the most remarkable movies in any age.
Eventually you have to consider to watch the rest of this trylogy composed of The adventure and The night.
A giant film!",1122336000,4,551,4.690721649484536
1116699,5,7560072771,"It's hard to imagine that many people reading this will need much persuasion that ""L'Eclisse"" is one of the masterpieces of world cinema. Although Antonioni's breakthrough film ""L'Avventura"" is usually advanced as his chef d'oeuvre, I think a strong case can be made that ""L'Eclisse"" not only demonstrates with a greater degree of virtuosity the alienated visual style that is his chief contribution to the art of film [certainly to the greatest degree of his black-and-white works, of which this was the magisterial conclusion], it is a more richly complex and nuanced development of his vision. The progression from ""L'Avventura""'s Sandro accidentally-on-purpose ruining the drawing of a younger architect doing the creatively engaged work he no longer can to ""L'Eclisse""'s stock trader ruined in a market crash adjourning to a cafe to doodle a picture of a butterfly on a napkin may seem a discouragingly small step - but in the magnified intensity of Antonioni's scrutiny of modern life, it is surprisingly hopeful.

Matching the commitment of Antonioni's work here is his legendary muse and collaboratrice Monica Vitti. The act of being-beautiful-on-film is a mysterious and - for all the critical ink spent on it - still an underappreciated one. But I wish to avoid giving the (entirely correct) impression that I'm just another of these bespectacled film geeks whose nearest approach to a passionate love affair was sitting in a dilapidated  revival theater swooning over the radiance of Signorina Vitti's  visage in the light of Gianni di Venanzo's luminous cinematography. So I'll confine myself to observing that although her showier turn as an extreme neurotic in Antonioni's following work ""Il Deserto Rosso"" is probably more often cited by defenders of her acting [and the charmingly goofy real-life Vitti seen in the outstanding supplemental material for this DVD makes it clear that these were performances - like most great actors of either sex, she is a creature of instinct rather than intellect], I would claim the exquisitely sensitive work she does here is the one Vitti portrayal to see if (for some unfathomable reason) you were going to see only one.

Speaking of the supplemental material, it sets a new high-water mark even by Criterion's already industry-leading standards. The hour-long Italian documentary on Antonioni - ""The Eye That Changed Cinema"" - not only contains archival footage of intense interest to students of the director [i.e. an acceptance speech with a touching tribute to the support Vitti provided him], it gave me an entirely new perspective on the English-language works that were soon to come. [So much so that I've had to write new Amazon reviews of them - which I hope will contribute more than the cursory ones I rattled off four years ago.] And although  Criterion isn't publicizing the image restoration work they did here the way they did for their ""L'Avventura"" DVD [no separate featurette on it, for example], it will be my pleasure to pick up the slack. This is the sharpest and most brilliant print of the work that could possibly be imagined - all the more dramatic arriving after the years of crude VHS tapes.

Molto grazie, Criterion.",1120608000,12,3198,5.105162523900574
1116700,5,7560072771,"The critical eye will never grasp the cinema of Antonioni. I mean what can one say about the ending of this film? It is beyond criticism. Antonioni awakens us to the world around us by placing the camera on seemingly unimportant, mundane objects which while not directly relating to the plot - show us an atmosphere and make us feel like we are, indeed, a part of our own environment. This awakening that takes place within us startles us - and while we can try to step outside ourselves and say that it is absurd or pointless - this is precisely the reaction that was most likely intended by Antonioni.",1118361600,4,603,4.490909090909091

7899905,5,7560072771,"""But I had arrived after seeing Antonioni's Eclipse that not all conventional movie-making and ways to tell narrative, especially on film as they traditionally are, his films elicit in me the awakening of new possibilities.  I did not marvel at the breath of his direction as I did after seeing The Passenger for the third or fourth time and afterall Mark Peploe's marvelous story potential (he contributed to Rene Clement final film's story and screenplay Wanted: Babysitter), but this time, the ending left me a little disappointed, perhaps as his ending initially do, save Blow-Up and Zabriskie Point, but I was thinking.  Kitten lay on top in the crook of my knee and thigh as I lay in bed trying to sleep.  It made me think of Monica Vitti and Alain Delon lying together and not knowing where to put their hands in the way.  I lay so she wouldn't be disturbed, but she could lay still longer than I could without turning, especially conscious of her on me, I began to laugh uncontrollably, while nearly asleep.  Yes, I liked Eclipse  although not a success at first, moreso in Japan.  And now I think I enjoyed Red Desert when I thought I disliked it after viewing it some months ago a second time.  Critics say Eclipse is his best film.  How did he attract so much attention?  Was Blow-Up with its ability to make people like Katherine Hepburn say, We play tennis WITH the ball! a new minimum?  I did like Eclipse and its song Eclipse Twist at the beginning to make me think of things like Kitten lying on my body, which is precarious because of my maddening ambivalent wish to disrupt her after so long, and the bliss of her finding me comfortable.""

The Criterion Collection edition must be out of print as it is hard to find a listing for it.  It is very good, but the second disc only has three extras while the first disc has only a commentary as a special feature.  I had gotten mine Used, so it was rather inexpensive, not always the case with Criterion, but becoming a thing of the future.  Newer editions from other distributors are soaring so that $39.00-$44.00 is commonplace for a blu-ray.  The Criterion edition I saw was DVD.
