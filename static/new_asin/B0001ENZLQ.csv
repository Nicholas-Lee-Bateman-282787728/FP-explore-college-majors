1994942,4,B0001ENZLQ,A great addition to any Bond Collection.  It has great behind the scenes stories and of course there are the BOND GIRLS then and  now!,1368057600,,134,4.32
1994943,5,B0001ENZLQ,"This is a great little documentary that briefly goes over all the Bond women (up to Die Another Day), The only reason I don't recommend this disc is because the 2 disc DVD copy of Casino Royale has an updated version of this documentary, including Eva Green, on the second disc. So if you really want this just buy Casino Royale, and that way you'll get the documentary and a movie.",1351123200,,382,4.394366197183099
1994944,4,B0001ENZLQ,"One of the Bond ""girls"" (there is a discussion in the film whether they should be called women) produced this film and starred in it. The film shows most of the women who appeared in the James Bond films until 2006. There are very short scenes showing them in the movies and we see them now, somewhat aged. The women tell how people responded to them more because of their appearances with James Bond than any other film or stage work. They also explain, among other things, how the behavior of the Bond women changed.",1326844800,2,518,4.463157894736842
1994945,4,B0001ENZLQ,"IF YOU HAVE ALL THE BOND FILIC THIS IS GREAT TO HAVE, BECAUSE IT SHOW THE WOMEN BEHIND BOND TO MAKE A OUTSTAND SERIES OF MOVIE.",1281139200,,127,3.923076923076923
1994946,5,B0001ENZLQ,"I always thought Bond Girls were Dream Girls, and that Maryam D'Abo was the loveliest of them all! Whether playing vamps, ladies in distress, or a...kicking b...ches, these lasses brought the movie's best fun, for what is the ultimate reason behind any cool car, sharp suit, or newest gadget? Why, THE GIRL, of course!!!

Ms D'Abo proves with her documentary (she wrote, produced and directed it) that Bond Girls (""Women""?, ""Sexual Mates""?, ""Female Persons""?, ""Whatever-politically-correct-idiocy-they'll-come-up-next""?) are not merely attractive, but good, intelligent actresses playing the toughest part there is in their craft: the fantasy everyone wishes to get or be. It may sound simple, but it's an Herculean, ehr... Aphrodithean task! How many thespians can convincingly play a drunkard? A cab driver? An honest cop? Quite a lot, to be sure. What good-looking woman can describe herself as the most gorgeous creature that ever walked on Earth? No one in her right mind. Well now ...try playing that!

Morons who criticize these brave actresses successfully undertaking this most thankless role, either don't get the joke or carry a burdensome yoke themselves; mainly envy or frustration. And producers who afterwards belittle them as ""bimbos"" are nothing but misogynist cretins; the very sexist pigs feminists should be quarrelling with! As for me, plain moviegoer, I gratefully say long live Bond Girls and the actresses that enlivened them! May they always get the parts they crave, for their proven skills deserve them!",1163548800,10,1530,5.397489539748954
1994947,2,B0001ENZLQ,"The film is listed as a ""documentary"" but it doesnt quite fit

the bill. In actually its a bit of escapades of scenes

featuring the bond girls on their work in the bond movies.

The thing that bothered me is how one instant some of the

actress that are interviewed from halle berry, to

Maryam d'abo (whose actually the interviewer), Jill St. John

all pass themselves of as feminists one minutes, the next

their defending themselves from accusations that the bond

girls are just sex objects when in fact they are SEX OBJECTS.

Its quite a hilarious contradiction. Some of the women

interview though like the beautiful Ursula Andress has no problem accepting the fact that she was a sex symbol and was hired for that reason only.

In fact actress like Madu Adam who played the love intereest to Roger Moore admits she had objections to the sexual script because it seemed that bond's character took the role of almost an agreesive rapist in a love making scene.

So it's an interesting movie with clips thrown in, but its far

from being an objective documentary.",1106179200,5,1068,4.67741935483871

8011563,5,B0001ENZLQ,"Well, let me just say that this Documentary is well done and for the Bond Girls that ARE in it, they did a good job! I really had hoped to have seen more interviews from some of them, especially from Tanya Roberts, Grace Jones, A VIEW TO A KILL, Carol Bouquet, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Famke Jansen, GOLDENEYE, Barbara Bach, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, Teri Hatcher, TOMORROW NEVER DIES.
I will take it though for the ladies that are featured, definitely, and I like that one of them actually narrated it and did the interviews, 1987's LICENSE TO KILL, Mary D'abo.
