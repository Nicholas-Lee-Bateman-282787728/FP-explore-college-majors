958166,3,6305056862,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. My 6-yr old daughter loves it and strongly prefers it to the classic Rudolph with the abominable snowman. The voice acting is first-rate, especially Woopie Goldberg as Stormella. The story line has some improvements over the other Rudolph. In particular, Santa doesn't reject him and his parent's don't force him to cover his nose. I found many of the songs to be fun, too. I also liked the themes of courage and honor. Rudolph has much more character in this version than in the old classic.
My biggest complaint is that it lapses back into the sexist roles so common in kids videos. True, there is a feminist moment when Rudolph says to another buck (referring to his doe-friend, Zoe) ""she's not a trophy. You shouldn't treat her like one!"" But other than that, we're back to the damsel in distress story line. It might be picking nits to note that the reindeer in this movie look more like whitetail deer than true reindeer (this is common in christmas books and videos). Unfortunately, this confusion between deer and reindeer winds up giving us a sleigh that is pulled by an all-male team with antlers while the antler-less females stand by and admire them. Anybody who's actually seen reindeer knows that both the males and females have antlers. I would have prefered it if my little girl were watching a sleigh pulled by a pack of reindeer of both sexes. (Why couldn't Vixen, Dancer, and Dasher be girls?)
So, in the world of flawed kids videos, this one's not too bad, but with a little more thought, they could really have done better.
P.S. As with most videos, this one's not appropriate for kids under 5 (too much good-evil, scary stuff).",1041984000,5,1694,4.6879194630872485
958167,2,6305056862,"My 4 yr old son really likes this movie, but I personally can't stand it.  I tend to pick cartoons apart for their animation, and this one was just terrible.  The characters suffer from extreme unneeded movement, the action is barely (if at all) synchronized with the dialog, and the cartoon doesn't come anywhere close to expressing the emotion that the voice actors are trying to convey.  It's almost like they finished the animation before they recorded the voices, then didn't go synch them up.  It could have been better if they had taken a little more time on it.",976492800,,569,4.66
958168,4,6305056862,I rented this video for my 3-year-old twin girls (now 4) and ended up buying it a couple of days later because they just absolutely fell in love with it. I know there is some negative scenes in it but they didn't phase  my kids. It's a great story and a real treat for youngsters of any age.,946944000,2,291,4.017241379310345

I also like that Santa likes Rudolph from the start on this movie, unlike the original where Santa only liked Rudolph after he got the idea for Rudolph to lead the team. His father accepted him better on this than the original.. The original the father  put something on his nose to keep it from glowing,, he didn't on this one.

Rudolph is born with his red nose, teased by the other reindeer, runs away, and meets many new friends and even an enemy, who turns out to be not so bad in the end. Includes several fun songs and new characters who are not part of the original Rudolph, but still fun to get to know throughout the movie.

958439,5,6305056862,This movie was severely underrated. It fits the original song better than the claymation and Santa Claus is not a bigot or jerk in this. It gives Rudolph a reason for having his red nose and also supplies a reason for the foggy Christmas Eve in which Rudolph gets his chance to shine (pun intended). It is an interesting take on a classic Christmas tale and it has adorable songs and characters. I loved it when I was a child and intend to show it to my own children someday. It is now my young niece's favorite Christmas movie! I would definitely recommend this underrated little treasure.,1376611200,3,590,4.5233644859813085

I saw it one year at my cousin's house and every year after I seek it out to watch it over and over again because I feel this movie is so much better! The animation is just awesome, the plot is great, I don't feel like any child of any age should be afraid of this movie at all. Stormella may say some nasty things in this movie but it never stuck out in my head, in fact, it made the movie all the more convincing for me when I was only 4 or 5 years old. I feel like the characters are more likeable, like they actually have personality in this film. I hope to get this movie on Netflix at one point, too, or iTunes since neither of them seem to have it. I was completely shocked. Overall, this movie deserves more than 5 stars.",1321142400,,840,4.005952380952381

But to my surprise it had it's own original story line. I found myself cheering more for this Rodolph then the stop motion animation one. I felt a more, ""go Rudolph! You can do it!"" Please do not buy this to compare it with the original movie. This one doesn't have dentist elves, and dudes looking for gold. It has fairies, and a wicked snow witch. However, there are certain commonalities between the original and this movie. First of all, the love between Rudolph and the doe, saving his doe, and the bad guy turning good in the end. I also prefered Santa Claus in this movie, over the original. In this version Santa tells Rudolph that he's a part of Santa's family no matter what. In the 1960's movie version Santa could careless about the little reindeer witht the red-nose, that is until Rudolph proved to be useful to Santa.",1230422400,2,985,4.417582417582418

On its own merits, kids should enjoy this familiar tale of the reindeer with the glowing nose who saves the day, although it's not on a foggy night, but during a horrendous blizzard whooped up by (no pun intended) Whoopi Goldberg as the Ice Queen Stormella.  All the ingredients are there, with a few added perils and characters, the most notable being Bob Newhart's Leonard the Polar Bear and Eric Idle's crafty Slyly the Fox.  The songs are pretty bad, with the exception of the lovely ""Show Me the Light"" given a nice ending rendition by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes.  Kids should enjoy the movie, and the adults can smile as they remember a far superior version from ""long ago.""",1133740800,,797,4.631205673758865
958458,4,6305056862,"I and my children really enjoyed this version of rudolph. Interestingly enough, this was the first version my children saw before the original Rudolph of so many years ago. What's wrong with a different twist almost 40 years later. Is the world suppose to stop back in 1964. Don't get me wrong I love the original Rudolph. I'm not particular to the follow up movies to it, but the original was a classic.

But this isn't the movie nor would I want it to be. This is a fresh take a new look, a new feel, and most of all just fun.

It has good messages to it and while sure I prefer my girls to see stuff like everafter and ella, there is also a place for the damsel to need saving, why because she is still strong willed, but admit it most women want to be a damsel in distress from time to time, whether its a mouse, a spider, or something more substantial. Come on its how rudolph shows he cares and is willing to go through anything for love.

now with all that said. This film is in its own right a classic, but it never got a chance to really shine because to many people compare it to something 40 years ago. Its the same fate that the new superman movie will befall, especially after reeve's death, and that is it will be forever compared to the original, no matter how good it is. All the actors who played bond after Connery have always been compared to Connery.

I just feel its sort of sad to see such an excellent film such as this be pushed to the wayside because it doesn't measure up to something it was never intended to be.",1101859200,10,1539,4.171717171717172
