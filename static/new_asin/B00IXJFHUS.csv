8646003,4,B00IXJFHUS,"Following his war drama La mer  l'aube (2011), German director Volker Schlndorff tackles another WWII story in Diplomacy (Diplomatie in French). Set in August 25, 1944, just before the Allied Forces enter Paris, Schlndorffs new period drama describes the Swedish consul-general Raoul Nordlings (Andr Dussollier) all-night negotiation with Dietrich von Cholitz (Niels Arestrup), German general in charge of the occupied Paris, who was ordered by Hitler to destroy the city including the landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. And Nording has to persuade Choltitz to disobey Hitlers direct order.

Those who have seen Ren Clments film Is Paris Burning?  in which Orson Welles and Gert Frbe played Nording and Choltitz respectively  already know the result and perhaps the controversies over the truth. Based on a play by Cyril Gely, Diplomacy is more like a drama about two persons confronting each other, than a reenactment of a historical episode. In this film Nording draws upon his every diplomatic skill in convincing Choltitz that saving the city is the best and only choice, while the situation surrounding the city changes by every minute.

Diplomacy is a little talky, but not very stagy, and some events are just incredible. Still, bolstered by two excellent performances, Diplomacy is a strong psychological drama, though what really happened in the Paris hotel room may have been different.",1426032000,,1409,5.300448430493273
8646004,5,B00IXJFHUS,"I just saw this movie at the Sedona Film Festival where it got a well deserved excellent reception. It is basically a filmed play but it still makes for a terrific movie. It covers the same ground as did the movie ""Is Paris Burning"" did almost 50 years ago. I suggest that everyone read the book ""Is Paris Burning"" for the complete story of the liberation of Paris.",1425513600,,365,4.382352941176471
8646005,5,B00IXJFHUS,Fascinating look at little-known (in the US at least) crucial moment in French history.  The DVD shipped fast and was a pleasure to watch.,1421020800,,138,4.75
8646006,5,B00IXJFHUS,"We often think of history as inevitable outcomes, but sometimes we forget that many things we hold dear were held in the balance in history. In late summer, 1944, the L'Arc de Triomphe, la Place de la Concorde, the Louvre, and the many ancient and modern streets of Paris could have been blown into oblivion in less than one day. Towards the end of August, 1944, the allies had retaken many of the Reich's former strongholds such as Rome and Tropoli. And now the allies were on the borders of German-occupied Paris about to storm and retake the most famous French city.

When the Reich realized they had no chance of resisting the allies from liberating the city from German occupation, Adolph Hitler made a final ultimatum: make Paris a ""scorched-earth"". In other words, destroy the city and lay it waste. It would be destruction on a massive scale which would not only destroy one of the most beautiful cities in the world but also murder potentially millions of lives. And yet there was neither strategic nor tactical advantage to razing Paris, only killing and mayhem. And the many monuments and art would be lost forever. Whether Hitler's order was out of pure insanity continues to be debated, although one thing is certain. The order was made most likely out of malice towards the allies and the rest Europe when it became obvious Hitler and Germany would be defeated and not as a puzzle piece towards any larger strategy to win the war.

For 3 to 4 days, General Von Choltitz, then German general in charge of Paris, orchestrated his young soldiers and engineers to plant hidden explosives under the many bridges over the Seine, the main waterway which runs through Paris. Explosive U-boat torpedoes were also deployed in tunnels under the city that, if ignited, would destroy Paris from the ground-up. At the same time, Resistance fighters had tried, unsuccessfully, to stop the deployment. At the beginning of the film, General Choltitz meets with his top commanders to begin the process of laying waste to Paris.

Then, the General receives an expected visitor, Raoul Nordling of the Swedish Consul in Paris. (In fact, the man who visited the general was Pierre Charles Tattinger, the mayor of Paris. For dramatic purposes, the characters of Tattinger and Nordling may have been combined into a single person.) The film becomes a dialogue between Nordling and Choltitz in which Nordling has to find a way to persuade the general that destroying Paris is not only a heinous criminal act even by wartime standards but also not in his best interests. After each of Nordling's arguments, Choltitz counters with other arguments, such as he cannot disobey orders from the Reich, particularly those of Hitler, no matter how monstrous they may be. Eventually, Choltitz offers Nordling a trump card which the diplomat can't seem to counter, unless he has something else up his sleeve to persuade the general.

A brilliantly written and acted film based on the play of the same name by Cyril Gely who also adapted the screenplay. Andr Dussollier as Nordling and Niels Arestrup as General Choltitz offer tour-de-force performances about a meeting which determined the fate of an historic city. Although we know the ending, we don't always know how we arrived there. ""Diplomatie"" (""Diplomacy"") shows us how we got there.",1420761600,2,3319,4.921428571428572
8646007,5,B00IXJFHUS,"Compelling movie that deals with the anguish moments previous to a imminent destruction of the City Light.

Andre Dussollier plays the role of a Swedish diplomatic who intends to persuade by all his means to avoid this coward and no sense act.

Formidable is the word in order to qualify this masterwork. Watching both superb actors around such dramatic event is a true blessing.

Astonishing drama superbly directed by W.S. (Tin drum), a true living legend of the German Cinema.

Don't miss this cinematic gem...",1420588800,,513,5.0
8646008,5,B00IXJFHUS,"This French and German production is an adaptation of the play `Diplomatie' by Cyril Gely. Set over one night in 1944 when the Allies are a few kilometres from Paris and the newly appointed Governor of Paris, General Von Choltitz, has been given the order to destroy Paris. Von Choltitz is played by the superb veteran French actor Niels Arestrup. He is approached, clandestinely, by the Swedish diplomat Raoul Nordling (Andre Dussollier) who tries to dissuade him from destroying the Eternal City.

The arguments flow back and forth like an unremitting tide whilst the Allies get ever closer and the German garrison gets ever more twitchy. Then after years of being dormant, the Rsistance takes up arms.

This is a beautifully acted piece of cinema; it stays virtually true to the play, but uses external shots, and archive footage to give the story more body. The real drama is played out between the two men and both give excellent performances. They are ably supported by a rather good cast which includes one of my favourite German actors - Robert Stadlober (`Summer Storm'). In French and German with very good sub titles, this is a work of fiction that retells a momentous moment in World War II and does it extremely well.",1420329600,5,1230,4.8246445497630335
8646009,4,B00IXJFHUS,"""Diplomatie"" (2014 release from France; 90 min.) is the big screen adaptation of the theater play of the same name by Cyril Gely. (Disclaimer: I have not seen the theater play.) The story takes place on the eve of the liberation of Paris in late August, 1944. The German commander-in-charge, General von Choltitz, has orders to destroy all of the main landmarks of Paris (Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the Notre Dame cathedral, etc.). Enter Swedish (but Paris-raised) diplomat Raoul Nordling, who tries talking von Choltitz out of implementing the orders from Berlin. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is directed by none other than legendary German film maker Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff, yes he of ""The Tin Drum"" from the late 1970s. Who knew he was still around and making movies? Second, while on some occasions there are scenes shot outside, beware that most of the movie takes place in the room at the Hotel Meurice where General von Scholtitz is based, and it truly needs to be emphasized that this is a theatre play brought to the big screen, but still very much a theatre play. Third, I am not a historian nor an expert of WWII, so I have no idea whether the events unfolded in real life as they are depicted in the movie. If they are portrayed accurately, you will be in for surprise or two towards the end of the movie. Last but certainly not least, the acting performances of the two lead actors (Andr&eacute; Dussollier as Raoul Nordling, and Niels Arestrup as General von Choltitz) are nothing short of top-notch and truly carry the film.

""Diplomatie"" has garnered rave reviews in Europe, and the screening where I saw this at in Antwerp, Belgium a few months ago in March during a family visit, was very well attended. Still, I don't know to what extent this success could be replicated in the US. For me, the movie was a bit too static/too close to a theater play to fully engage me from start to finish, although certainly the performances from Dussollier and Nordling are noteworthy. I would readily suggest that you check this movie out if you get the chance, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1400544000,9,2247,4.700507614213198
