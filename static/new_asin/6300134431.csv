Many of us have spent years searching for and waiting for this movie to come out on DVD.  Today, while searching, again, I see it's available, so, run and get a copy before they are gone.",1376611200,,335,4.203125

7803109,5,6300134431,"I saw this movie when it was first released and have never forgotten it.  I keep searching for a version with English subtitles but no luck (according to another review)

This is a very powerful film.  The acting is superb.  What captivated me the most was the very accurate portrayal of how history is truly made -- like the fable of the 6 blind men and the elephant -- people witnessing history as it is made has only a partial view of events.  That the royal couple is never seen underscores that fact.

I don't why this film hasn't been put on a DVD accessible to all.  This is a truly great movie.  I keep hoping I will be able to get a copy some day.",1229731200,3,656,4.150793650793651
7803110,3,6300134431,"I have long waited for a DVD of this wonderful film, but this Portuguese productions is not quite the answer. I could acccept the absence of English subtitles; I have sen the film on an off-the-air version enough to have a good idea of what was going on. In fact, without the subtitles I was able to appreciate the beauty of the acting and photography more, but when this version ended abruptly with the Countess kneeling before the regalia of the king, which to her had become the king, I gasped. So I want on to the ""alternative"" ending on  the disc. After a brief sequence showing the crowd following the king's carriage heading back to Paris the disc moved to the ending with which I was familiar, with Restif watching the peep show on the quay. But when he begins to ruminate about how history will regard the events we have seen, the sound track is suddenly in Italian and no appeal to the menu will change it! The last voice is not Jean Louis Barrault's but of some unknown dubber! Is there no version of this film in the archives which would have been more faithful to the original? Back to my old TV tape complete with commercial breaks and mispronounced French title. Phooey!",1182297600,15,1185,4.486111111111111
7803111,5,6300134431,"This film is visually very beautiful and the acting by Marcello Mastroiani (Casanova), Hanna Schygulla, Harvey Keitel (Thomas Paine), and Restiff de Bretonne as ""insiders"" of the French Revolution who are all coincidentally thrown together one day, is quite convincing.  This is the behind-the-scenes story of Louis XVI's & Marie Antoinette's aborted attempt to cross the German border in 1791 to her brother's army which was ready to invade France and crush the French Revolution.  As they are getting near Germany, the king is recognized in the small town of Varennes, where he is detained and later arrested.  It was this single event which caused the Revolutionaries to order the executions of the king and queen a year later.

However, we never even see the royal couple.  The people we meet are the passengers of the stage coach which is following the king.  Several of them have no idea that the king is ahead of them.  The passengers include Casanova, a prominent industrialist later killed by the Revolution, the American revolutionary Thomas Paine, an Italian opera soprano, and a lady-in-waiting to the queen, the only one in on what's going on.  They all encapsulate their time and all have lively, opinionated, and contradictory views of the terrible events of their day.  Hanna Schygulla is stunning as the conservative monarchist who is very sympathetic in her portrayal.  She is someone we can like, admire, or love, yet she is fatally flawed in her loyalty to the side that is going to lose.  Even though we never know what happens to her, there is a gloomy feeling that she will die at the guillotine.

Mr. Scola has created a masterpiece that not only gives us an intimate view of the historical past, but also makes us aware of its connection to our own time.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I have been trying to get this for years, but it seems to be unavailable.  I am sorry there are no English subtitles on this item.  This movie is a gem which deserves more attention.",1168041600,11,2013,4.741379310344827
7803112,5,6300134431,"The night of Varennes is a haunting and reflective portrait about a supposedly event concerning to the autumnal stage of Casanova' s memories lived and narrated by himself surrounded of avid people, wishful to know about his past adventures.

This is essentially a poetic film, supported by a very imaginative script and also an enviable cast, starred by the unforgettable Marcello Mastroianni and the divine actress Hanna Schygulla (The marriage of Maria Braun). The initial shot focuses about a picture that slowly begins to dissolve before our profane eyes, tinged of magisterial beauty.

Ettora Schola was undoubtedly an outstanding director, who decided to risk  himself with this haunting story and won for the posterity, since in my opinion the film increases and enhances itself through the years.

If you are seeking for a very distinguished picture for your personal collection and simultaneously to enjoy the art-cinema, go for this expressive, lovable and adorable masterpiece.

What will they be waiting for to release on DVD format?",1152835200,4,1046,5.315151515151515

7803114,5,6300134431,This is extremely well done. Costumes are excellent and well as the props settings and various scenes. It was the movie that made seek out a read Retif de la Bretonne. The movie takes several very strong and strictly in character persons and places them together on the coach following the fleeing King and Queen. I would say this is a must have for anyone interested in the French Revolution. I cant wait for this to be out on DVD.,998870400,11,432,4.4125
