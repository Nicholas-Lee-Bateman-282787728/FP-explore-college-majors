8547150,1,B00A6TM9ZE,"Accurate title - meaning, self absorbed characters accept for dad's girlfriend.  Per the usual ""indie"" film, no resolutions amongst these relations. Mostly flat dialogue and development - except for the part when the bear got in the house!  Thank goodness for the bear - it woke my husband up!",1420416000,,293,4.959183673469388
8547151,3,B00A6TM9ZE,"I liked this movie, but it may just be the actors.  I watched it several times.  It  could definitely do well as a weekly TV show.  All the characters are like-able and the scenery is gorgeous.  Everyone is attractive... It's a VERY SLOW-GOING MOVIE and the ending pretty much sucks, because it leave you hanging.  But I still like it...but can easily see how some, especially guys might think it's a boring waste of time.

What's seems a little strange is how the film portrays some of the familial strains as being somehow abnormal, when they aren't.  Perhaps the interracial, class and and age contrasts simply intensifies these strains, but the concerns while timeless seem very now.  I could watch it again...but I wouldn't pay to do so.",1408060800,,742,4.734375

8547154,5,B00A6TM9ZE,"A great movie about life, growing up, change and compromise; life is complex. This movie is a great Character Study film.",1403222400,,121,4.809523809523809
8547155,2,B00A6TM9ZE,"draggy, amateurish, formulaic, vaguely embarrassing.  not worth a look or a thought in my personal opinion.  you have been warned",1380844800,,129,5.4
8547156,5,B00A6TM9ZE,"This is just a fantastic movie. It's intelligent, thoughtful, well-written, and beautifully filmed.  John Slattery, Gabrielle Union, and Jenna Malone all give exceptional performances.  If you're looking for a movie full of violence and car chases, this isn't for you - but if you're looking for an insightful meditation on family, home, and growing up, you can't do better than In Our Nature.  It's destined to become a cult classic, I'm sure of it.",1362873600,3,450,5.054054054054054
