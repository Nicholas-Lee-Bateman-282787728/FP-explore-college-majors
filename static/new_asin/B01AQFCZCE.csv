8748027,5,B01AQFCZCE,"Great music from the past! But don't look for great picture quality--these shows are from old kinescope recordings (google the word if you're not familiar with the term).  That aside, the music is absolutely delightful!  Although the listing says that it contains the 1955 Christmas and New Year's shows--it ALSO contains  the 1955 Easter Show and a show from 1953. Some of the songs performed are Moments To Remember, How Important Can It Be, Theme From Moulin Rouge. Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White, I Believe, He, Sixteen Tons, Tweedly Dee, Chatanooga Choo Choo (a Hit Parade ""extra""), Easter Parade, White Christmas and many more.  Shows include the original Lucky Strike and Richard Hudnut commercials.  You can't go wrong with wonderful talents like Dorothy Collins, Snooky Lanson, Russell Arms,Gisele MacKenzie and June Valli.  You WILL love this dvd--get while you can!",1504656000,,881,5.212765957446808
