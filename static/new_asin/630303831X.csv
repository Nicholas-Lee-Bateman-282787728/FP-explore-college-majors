554762,5,630303831X,"Why this hasn't been released on DVD is a complete mystery. I'm a record, CD, video collector. I have 5,000 plus LP's and 100's of videos. I found this video by accident in a 2nd hand shop and have nearly worn it out playing it to many friends, family and professional musician mates. No one, I mean no one, isn't blown away by this video. Tonight I'm searching the internet to see if there is a DVD release (which there isn't) so now I'm looking for a spare VHS tape (mine is nearly worn out). This is definitely a 5 out of 5 video. Al Green with Lyle Lovett - Wow. I watched this at least 5 times before I realised it was Billy Preston on keyboards. Unbelievable track. Little Richard with Tanya Tucker. Check out the drummer. Sam and Conway on Midnight train to Georgia. Natalie Cole and Reba McIntyre staggering. The Pointer Sisters and Clint Black etcc. This is one of the big mysteries of life why this is a such a little known project. ...",1042761600,11,946,4.320224719101123
554763,5,630303831X,"This video is an excellent account of the magic,and not so magic moments that occurred in the making of the Album of the same name! It is an up close and personal look behind the scenes of what, in my opinion is the clever joining together of the cream of Country and R & B recording artists performing some old, and not so old Blues and R & B tunes!  With a tasty hint of country added.  There are also very interesting and informative comments from the artist about each of their respective songs. Songs like ""Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing""..Gladys Knight & Vince Gill,...Patches..George Jones & B.B.King...Rainy Night In Georgia..Sam Moore & (The Late Great)..Conway Twitty...To name a few,  but they are all brilliant. And this video captures beautifully, the raw emotion that made the hairs on the back of my neck prickle up the first time I saw it,and in fact every time I see it even now! ...",1032393600,5,903,4.561728395061729

7836770,5,630303831X,"If you own the album, you'll want this video as well. It captures the energy, humor and creative soul that made ""Country, Rhythm & Blues"" the listen-to-it-over-and-over musical masterpiece it is. It's worth the price just for the Lyle Lovett/Al Green duet alone!",1301788800,,262,5.116279069767442
7836771,5,630303831X,"Rodney King said: ""Why can't we just get along?""

Well this video, and its awesome companion Compact Disc, proves you can.
This is the documentary of a wonderful ""once-in-a-lifetime"" set of musical collaborations between some of the most outstanding and enduring country and r&b singers who have graced the airwaves across this country.

Each duet is a beautiful joint interpretation of a well known song- breathing life, pain, hope and memories as only true artists and real people can. It's ""Ebony and Ivory"" at its best.",1270684800,,523,5.069767441860465
7836772,5,630303831X,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones when it comes to this video.  I have it on laser disk.  If ever there was a release that deserved to be rereleased on DVD, this is it!  Conway and Sam doing ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" is a thing of beauty.  Travis and Patty combining on ""When Something Is Wrong With My Baby"" only proves that putting two power house voices on one track is explosive magic.  And, any time you can get legends like George and B.B. on a single track, you've got something worth listening to, again and again, and keeping, forever.  Clint and the Sisters - Oh Wow!  I'm telling you folks, they just don't get any better than this.  Every cut - Every track - Every minute, is well worth the price of admission, every time.",1225411200,,733,4.260869565217392
7836773,5,630303831X,"I have owned the CD/audio version of the music on this VHS program for several years, and just discovered that there is a video as well! I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone who loves good music - note I did not say  what kind of music - just good music.",1191024000,3,262,3.943396226415094
7836774,5,630303831X,"An historic fusion, a lesson, memorable soulful duets.
If ever there was a memorable moment in history, it is this union of supreme entertainers from soul and country whose impressive duets serve for wonderful listening pleasure. The musical duets are so enjoyable.

You will hear soundbites of insights about country, rockabilly, soul, rock & roll, delta blues, gospel. On this night, it melds into an historic event of just plain great music. Excellent black and white footage of the the south connects you to the origination of these musical blends. They talk how the genres originated, what the music means, Rufus Thomas, Don Was, Tony Brown, etc. The country artists and r&b artists compliment each other and speak of the influences that each music genre music brings into one another.

The top musicians in the industry are here, in other words, premium entertainers! Natalie Cole admits watching the country awards show (when no one was watching) and admiring Reba. They duet on ""Since I Fell For You."" And Reba, like Travis Tritt, can evoke a soulful sound when inspired to do so. Travis duets with Patty LaBelle for the passionate ""When Something is Wrong With My Baby."" Hear the smooth Al Green team with Lyle Lovett for the beautiful ""Funny How Time Slips Away."" Little Richard and Tanya Tucker really shake it up for ""Somethin' Else"". Tucker with her gravely, powerful voice sounds dynamic with Little Richard. Sam Moore & Conway Twitty provide a soulful, fun ""Rainy Night in Georgia.""

Also, some other duets: Staple Singers and Marty Stuart ""The Weight""; George Jones & B.B. King ""Patches""; Chet Atkins & Allen Toussant ""Summer Nights""; Clint Black & The Pointer Sisters ""Chain Chain Chain""; Vince Gill & Gladys Knight ""Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing.""

To reiterate, this union will go down in music history!

7836775,5,630303831X,"I have a few hundred VHS music tapes. Rhythm Country & Blues seems to come up more than all of them. It captures some of the greatest singers of all times and pairs certain voices to create a music video that has to be seen and heard to believe!
If it was the cake then Country and R&B would be the ingredients.
Why this VHS hasn't been released on a DVD format is unbelieveable!",1047168000,8,379,4.135135135135135
