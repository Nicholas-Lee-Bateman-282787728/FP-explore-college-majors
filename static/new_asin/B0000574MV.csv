7932868,5,B0000574MV,"A stranger wanders on to a rich farmers ranch, discovers he has a lot of cash, convinces the farmers daughter to steal her fathers cash, and elope to the city with him. In the city, the strangers girlfriend is enraged to see him with another woman. When the stranger discovers the farmers daughter is to inherit millions from an uncle, he hurries to marry her before she realizes hes after her money. Conflicts galore within this threesome. This film is the premier example of a feature comedy of the period. Pure humor with no dialogue cards that I recall. Chaplin is a genius at this type of film, and Normand and Dressler give stand out performances. This film is very slapstickyits hard to imagine anything they didn't bump into, fall over, or get hit with. [I estimate 200 falls, and that may be conservative.] The film may be too slapsticky for contemporary tastes, but its great fun if you give it a chance. I highly recommend this movie and any Chaplin film, for that matter.",1524355200,,983,4.622857142857143
