8050312,5,B0007PAO2C,"This tape has two episodes. The only one I cared about was #1. The Steel-Plated Security Blanket with Farrah Fawcett (Charlie's Angels) and Lara Parker (Dark Shadows) kidnapped from a beauty contest (and what beauties they are). One of Parker's better guest spots after Dark Shadows ended.
#2. Omega One with guest star Sam Jeffe (Ben Casey) mixed up with terrorists. Nice to buy the tapes for your favorite guest stars if you don't want to buy the entire series on DVD.",1187913600,,470,4.7439024390243905
