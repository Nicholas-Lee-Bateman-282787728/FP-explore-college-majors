8490072,2,B005ZXKM8M,"....with Shadow's brief review.  While the acting is not what I had hoped, I've found many Hollywood productions to contain worse.  As a movie on Freemasonry, it lends itself more to the ""speculative"" variety as I am unfamiliar with any sources supporting the storyline.  As a story, it was entertaining, in the genre of ""National Treasure"".  I have found that the more I've watched it, the more I liked it and the more forgiving of some of the performances I've become.  I look forward to viewing ""Templar Nation"", the second in a loosely connected (theme wise) trilogy.",1380844800,,571,4.845360824742268
