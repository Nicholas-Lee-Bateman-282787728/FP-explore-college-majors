8041238,2,B0006FFRDE,The series was taken down before I finished watching. But there was too much shonen fan service for my taste.,1360454400,,109,4.5
8041239,2,B0006FFRDE,"This movie is just a waste of money and the story is so juvenile that it might as well be rated NC-17 for how much skin can we show and not be rated XXX. Don't waste your money, especially if you have young children at home.",1221782400,4,224,3.891304347826087
8041240,4,B0006FFRDE,"I watched the whole series, not just this box set. I am including this as there is not much commentary in north america about this series.

This was a pretty good series. Only drawback is that animation is quite mediocre ie if used to ghost in the shell/mamoru oshi stuff, then it looks very cheap. Cheap in that there is not much contrast in color scheme & palette is bluish.

HOwever, if you liked MIDNIGHT RUN w/ De Niro which action sequences were very clever, not predictable & situations were funny. THen YOu would love this series.

Not as pretentious as NOIR. Very Fun.

Please note that amazon review that this show is very fan service is wrong. Only fan service really in opening credit & beginning episodes. NOT like Aika or Najica level.",1111017600,28,749,4.567164179104478
