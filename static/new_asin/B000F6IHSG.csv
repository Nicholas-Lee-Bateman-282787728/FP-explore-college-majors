2552922,5,B000F6IHSG,"This Criterion edition of Dazed and Confused is very good.  The commentary track with Linklater is very informative and entertaining.  The deleted scenes are as good as what made it into the film.  The featurette on disc two is extremely worthwhile.  The booklet has essays and an outstanding collection of quotes from actors, etc. about the different stages in making the film.  The packaging is gorgeous.

Also, this is one of the greatest movies ever made.",1149724800,15,459,4.973684210526316
2552923,5,B000F6IHSG,"Fans of this movie have had to suffer two bare bones editions before finally being richly rewarded with this new special edition from the fine folks at the Criterion Collection.

The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Richard Linklater who is clearly still bitter about how the studio screwed him over and mentions it frequently. He talks at length about which parts of the film are autobiographical in his usual, easygoing, genial way, delivering yet another top notch track filled with great anecdotes, smart observations and cautionary tales about the dangers of working with a Hollywood studio.

Also included are 17 deleted scenes, including footage of Pink and his friends stealing the statues that we see later on in the film painted as the band members from Kiss.

There is also a theatrical trailer.

The second disc kicks off with an impressive, 50 minute retrospective documentary entitled ""Making Dazed"" that combines behind-the-scenes footage from 1992 with the ten-year cast and crew reunion with more recent interviews as well. This is a fascinating look at the challenges that Linklater faced on his first studio movie.

""Auditions"" features footage of 12 cast members reading for the film. It is pretty easy to see why they were cast as they slip into character quite naturally - especially someone like Rory Cochrane who eerily becomes Slater or Nicky Katt who effortlessly embodies his redneck bully.

""Beer Bust at the Moon Tower"" features cast members being interviewed in character during the first week of rehearsal in an effort to get them familiar with their roles. Also included are cast interviews that look like they were done early on in production or during filming. Highlights include an amusing and candid clip of Wiggins and Christine Harnos before their kissing scene in the movie. There is also quite a bit of behind-the-scenes footage that was seen only briefly in ""Making Dazed.""

Finally, there is an impressive 72-page booklet with essays and interviews. And to top it all off a fold out movie poster is included as well.",1149206400,105,2084,5.076023391812866
2552924,5,B000F6IHSG,"I love this movie. It's one of my favorite teen comedies. It helped jump start the careers of the film's soon-to-be stars, such as: Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Matthew McConaughey, Rory Cochrane, Jason London, and Milla Jovovich, to name a few. By the end of my first viewing, I was hooked. I became obsessed with the movie, and have seen it so many times that I've lost count, and it's still fresh and hilarious with every viewing (which is rare for a film)! It has become one of my favorite movies of all time, as well.

It doesn't necessarily have a plot, it's basically about the last day of school at a high school in a small town in Texas in 1976. The soon-to-be seniors are initiating the soon-to-be freshmen, A few friends are trying to get Aerosmith tickets, and everyone is trying to party or get stoned, drunk, or laid. Oh yeah. Dazed and Confused is definitely a cult classic, and a movie I could watch easily over a million times. Even though it's about the END of the school year, it's still fun to watch whenever. Oh, and Slater is my favorite character by far. The soundtrack is AWESOME as well, featuring songs by: Aerosmith, Foghat, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, War, ZZ Top, Peter Frampton, KISS, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

This is, hands down, one of the greatest teen movies ever made. People who grew up in the 70's claim this movie captures the time perfectly (just read some of the reviews here!), and this movie is definitely a must see. It'll make every young viewer wish they were there partying and having a good time, and every adult remember the good times they had during their teenage years. So, if you're looking for an entertaining flick to watch or want a flick that you AND your buddies will enjoy, check out ""Dazed and Confused"".

And for those who are angry that another DVD release of this film is out, you should just give your old D&C DVDs away and grab this one. In fact, Universal are the ones who SCREWED us, the fans, with their lackluster efforts for BOTH of the DVDs they've released (the barebones edition and the Flashback edition). Sure they REMASTERED the film for the Flashback edition, but there could've been so much more on THAT edition. Linklater was supposively going to record a commentary for the Flashback edition, but he didn't meet Universal's deadline, so they decided to release the DVD without the Making Dazed 10th anniversary documentary AND Linklater's commentary, hence, he was disappointed with the Flashback edition DVD, and Criterion gave Linklater enough freedom to put all of the bonus features he wanted on a ""Dazed"" DVD. They even allowed him and cinematographer Lee Daniel to supervise the high definition transfer of the film that will be used on the Criterion DVD. However, the HD transfer will be down converted to DVD resolution for the DVD release. It's impossible for the standard DVD format to reach the resolution of High Definition, although DVDs (especially now) can look very good.

Special features include the following:
* All new high-definition digital transfer, supervised by Richard Linklater and cinematographer Lee Daniel
* Audio commentary by Linklater
* ""Making Dazed,"" a 50-minute documentary by filmmaker Kahane Corn
* Booklet featuring new essays by film critic Kent Jones, music critic Jim DeRogatis, and author Chuck Klosterman, plus character profiles, and memories of the film from cast and crew
* More than two hours of rare on-set interviews and behind-the-scenes footage featuring cast and crew
* Footage from the 10-year anniversary celebration
* Audition footage
* Deleted Scenes
* Original trailer
* Collectible film poster",1145577600,112,3669,4.875

""Like...how?""

So many people have posted reviews of this movie that I'm sure I have nothing new to say about it. All I'll say is, see it. If you went through middle school or high school anywhere during the 70's, see it. If you dig the music, fashions, and/or substances (ahem) associated with that period, see it. If you grew up in Texas, see it. If you want to see early Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck (in the only role in which I can stand him), see it. If you're just in the mood for a good laugh about what it used to be like to be a teenager, see it. And when you see it, see this expanded DVD edition. It contains an amazing wealth of added materials that are worth the price by themselves (including original auditions footage; priceless).

2552938,5,B000F6IHSG,"Dazed is a wonderful film. I adore it. It was made with a whole lotta heart and came from a place of warmth and kindness. It is a film about teenage ritual and hopeful anticipation. We are shown visions of shared memories and glimpses of things we too can remember. Even fondly. When you look back on it, you were never really that complicated. Just going through the motions of American life. Dazed separates itself from the typical cliches beholden of teen films. It feels startlingly poetic in scope and material. Director Richard Linklater paced the film perfectly. It is incredibly rich and satisfying to experience. An art film you can laugh at. A comedy that holds you there in the forever moment.

""You just gotta keep livin' man, L-I-V-I-N.""

Dazed depicts teenagers who are in preparation. They are ritualistic and full of angst. They question the world around them but Linklater never lets even the most intellectual characters get too deep or lost in themselves. Nothing feels fake or forced or tried. And you can see how these kids will live thereafter. You can imagine what role in society they will play. You might get sad about it but it's all there. Who they'll grow up to be, waysides and all. The bright future's footnotes. You can also imagine the freshman kids, their senior counterparts, and what function they will serve when they are about to graduate. Everything is loyal to ritual. Teenagers are very formalistic people. They believe in rites and ceremony and passing the torch. Each generation beholden of the previous one. Where apprenticeship and nurture, ribbing and confusion thrive.

Let's talk about the need of a ""visceral experience"". For all of the laughs that Dazed gets from me, and it gets probably a record number of them, it also makes me wince and cringe because there are some genuinely uncomfortable moments throughout the film. Like bipolar vignettes, or very honest ones, the film is told almost episodically in slivers and shards. Moods can shift suddenly, as teenagers are nothing if not both lackadaisical and unpredictable at the same time, and the film can be unexpectedly touching. It's impossible not to invest a great deal of love and interest and devotion into all of the characters, because you actually feel like you know them. And you probably do. I know several versions of them, I've run into people like them all my life. I identify strongly with several different characters at different times, it's impossible not to when faced with a mosaic of familiarity like you get in Dazed. And when the film actually is startling and emotional, you feel it like some sort of unpleasant but nostalgic tingling somewhere in the recess of your memory. You remember how that exact instance felt. And since Linklater had you smiling just moments before you were startled, the roller coaster of teenage life was relived. Felt again.

""All I'm saying is that if I ever start referring to these as the best years of my life - remind me to kill myself.""

Dazed is a film about waiting around. What did you do the most of when you a teenager? I'm sure it was really just a lot of waiting for something to happen. Waiting to go somewhere. Waiting to talk to some girl. Waiting for beer. Waiting for pot. Or just waiting. It's about kids first realizing how boring life is and how to deal with it. There's a lot of driving around because that's what kids do. They socialize and do nothing. They may attempt to pontificate to one another but only briefly before remembering that it doesn't really matter anyway. That only the moment they are stuck in does, all the while refusing to admit that they truly are making the most of it. Self consciously blending into the scenery.

I see Dazed as a true adolescent art film. I know full well that it was a 'big movie', Linklater's first on that scale, but Dazed covers the whole spectrum of stubborn and confident teenage emotions and wants. And since the story is told the way that it is, through glimpses and visions and vignettes, it definitely does not behave like your standard teenage fare. It operates on a far more dedicated level. On a level of purpose and poignancy. If all Linklater wanted you to do was laugh at Dazed, he could have done without the 'visceral experiences' and tender trueness. He wanted you to remember who you were, to take a glimpse at the kid who used to be. The one that was so sure of himself. The one that would probably kick your ass if he saw what you became. The kid who had all those hopes just waiting to be fully realized. It's a very smart film with plenty of layers to go around. It's shot perfectly and captured masterfully. The script is so good that you'll hardly be able to believe that somebody actually wrote it. And the acting is out of this world.

""What are you looking at? Wipe that face off your head, bitch.""

Talk about quotability. Talk about a stellar cast. This film has got to be able to boast having the best ensemble of the '90s. Impeccable performances abound. My favorites being Adam Goldberg's Mike Newhouse, Parker Posey's Darla Marks and, of course, Matthew McConaughey's Wooderson. Those three actors stole the show for me. Goldberg and Posey both went on the become two of my favorite character actors, having proven to possess enormous ability and talent. McConaughey is someone I wish had held on though. He seems to have disappeared after Dazed... :)

I love this movie! The cast is almost too perfect.

""Something more tangible than an Abraham Lincoln dream.""

Dazed is a film you can touch and hold onto. Palpable. Style and substance as one. Corporeal. The film tracks the crescendo of positive self discovery and kinship. It is ageless. It may be set in the '70s but it speaks to everyone who watches it, regardless of their age group and social backgrounds. Dazed is vastly different from the other teen films of it's time. It is vastly superior. Dazed is easily the best film of it's time and place. Linklater was really trying to say something here. Musically, lyrically, and effortlessly. But I think that the most potent thing of all, is that it was all a big nothing. Linklater was trying to communicate the boredom and anticipation of teen life. But he was also trying to document the daily climax of it. The ethereal. That wild, insatiable feeling of longevity and neverendingness. Dazed is a perfect documentation of that. It earns a spot in my top ten favorite films, hell it practically steals it. A perfect film. Alright, alright, alright...",1405641600,2,6514,4.720316622691293

2552945,2,B000F6IHSG,"Maybe I really needed to have lived during the stoner years of the 70's in order to understand or appreciate this cult classic, but I've never considered `living during an era' to be a prerequisite for liking or appreciating a film.  Sadly, I just couldn't get behind `Dazed and Confused', and while I understand that it was trying to be this nostalgic look at the carefree time of adolescence and the confusion that comes from growing up, it never really went anywhere.

The story follows a group of kids and splinters off to tell their stories.  You have Randall the quarterback who is being forced to sign a pledge to stay away from drugs while he's on the team.  You have Mitch, the young freshman trying to avoid a beating as he makes his way into High School.  And we have a group of outcasts, most notably Mike and Tony, who are trying to make their own little impact.  Sadly, none of these stories are all that compelling, and they are mostly corroded by horrible acting.

Adam Goldberg and Wiley Wiggins are especially horrific here.

There are a slew of familiar faces here, before they were familiar.  Joey Lauren Adams, Milla Jovovich, Matthew McConaughey, Parker Posey, Ben Affleck and Cole Hauser are all here in small roles, but it is clear why they went on to have the larger careers out of the cast since they are the ones who do the most with the material (well, Jovovich doesn't do much).  Affleck is my personal favorite here.  He's kind of hilarious.

Still, when all is said and done, this film gets a mere shrug from me.  It isn't awful, but it went nowhere and I found myself uninterested most of the time.  It all felt so anticlimactic, and maybe that was the point (you know, being all dazed and confused like) but at the end of the day you want to feel as though a film had a purpose and this film doesn't say and or do anything of note.  The final party scene comes and goes without much impact, and all that build up for nothing!  Like I said, I didn't live through this period of time and so maybe my judgment is skewed because it isn't affected by any nostalgia, but if nostalgia is the only reason to like this movie then why bother.",1370908800,4,2165,4.429292929292929

2552954,2,B000F6IHSG,"When this movie first came out in 1993, I remember so many other saying it was the coolest stoner coming of age flick since Fast Times.  Well, I didn't see it like that.  I was actually kind of turned off by it.  I mean, the main thing that stood out to me what the characters.  For the most part, all sucked, from the acting down to the lines they spit out.  So bad.  Most of these kids couldn't act there way out of a paper bag.  Seriously, it was like a high school project filmed.  Three were a couple that did OK, like the football quarterback Jason London and the brief appearance from Matthew McConaughey, but that's about it.  The main kids Wiley Wiggens, Rory Cochrane and Adam Goldberg were almost unwatchable.  Painful to see act on the screen.  I understand this was basically an independent film, but come on.  I get it, it was a small town with nothing to do, but really?

The plot, or lack of.  Not unlike an episode of Seinfeld, this story never really goes anywhere.  No witty lines, jokes, characters or story to make it great like Jerry's show.  First it seems to be about a jock, then about a freshman boy, then a girl, but nothing really happens to make sense beyond stupid antics and week growth.  Just bad acting and lame actions.

The sound track was a good selling point, but basically if you have a radio that can pick up a classic rock station, you're not hearing anything you don't hear everyday.

I really wanted to like this movie.  It was part of my youth, but just couldn't get into it.  I didn't hate it, but wouldn't buy it.  Maybe if it was on TV, I would recommend watching it.

If you want to see what life was really like back in the late 70's / early 80's, I HIGHLY recommend Over The Edge and Fast Times At Ridgemont High.  The closest true to what I remember teen life stories that made sense, told a good story and had great music.",1330732800,4,1873,4.285714285714286

This movie gets it 95% right. Just love it. It's like watching my high school years all over again. A time when big brother was not perched on you, looking over your shoulder, & people just excepted the exuberance of youth. No rap, hip hop, extreme metal, or gangs, just great music. Just unadulterated fun! Just a time of more freedom, when rock n- roll, drive-in movies, & friendship was all you needed. Not that many of these things are not true now, but this was a simpler, more free time in many ways.

The soundtrack is spot on for a time for me when everything was new, fun, & not jaded. A true portrait of a time that will never be again, not for me. All the more amazing since it was from 1993, but the people behind this film were obviously not.

  The Blunt Truth (SD; 4:21) is a parody of the old Educational Films documentaries many of us were forced to watch growing up in school, this one of course about the horrors of marijuana use.
  Retro Public Service Announcements (SD; 2:03) are two PSA's which play like parodies but are actual vintage pieces, one about venereal disease (replete with bouncy theme song, and no I'm not kidding) and the other the famous littering ad featuring the crying Native American.
  U Control has only one fairly lame toggle switch giving information on the tunes that fill the soundtrack.

2552961,5,B000F6IHSG,"Love this movie....but I don't remember hearing much about it the year that it came out, 1993. It apparently has gained more popularity SINCE it's release. If you grew up in the '70's, as I did, there'll be alot there to bring back memories for you. The director commentary was a bit disappointing for me, as it seemed like the director was reminising more about his own memories from highschool rather than the memories he had of casting/making the film itself.  I think that I recognized Renee Zellweger in a scene: at the beer bust at the moontower, she's the girl in the striped shirt sitting in the back of a pickup truck helping the Parker Posey character dring beer from a funnel. Oh, and another Zellweger sighting in the movie takes place shortly before the Wooderson (McConeghy) line, 'that's what I like about these highschool girls....I get older, they stay exactly the same.'  It's pretty cool to see actors like Matthew McConeghy and Ben Affleck before they became famous......and even actors like Parker Posey, Milla Jojovich, Rory Cochrane, and Adam Goldberg who have since gained fame in more of a character actor genre. Before there was MTV, video games, cell phones.....pretty much all high school age kids had to do during summer in the '70's was ride around in cars and see what was going on. And the whole plot of this movie takes place the last day of school before summer break. And the rising freshmen boys were running scared from the senior boys who were only interested in their hazing ritual.....paddling them with thick, wooden paddles. And the rising freshmen girls didn't escape, either, they were treated like babies, complete with pacifiers, covered with food, and forced to ""propose"" to senior boys. It's fun to follow the Mitch and Sabrina characters, each fresh from their hazing rituals, being allowed to follow along with the older kids during the day's/night's events. It's alot of retro fun.....",1270512000,3,1936,4.899390243902439
2552962,4,B000F6IHSG,"Dazed and Confused is one of the best films ever made.  In particular, it captures the feeling of high school in most any small town in the United States.  The film is set at the end of the school year in 1976, the 200th birthday of the USA, but my wife and I agree that the tone of the high school experience is timeless (I graduated in 1989 and she graduated in 1998).  Nearly every high school archetype is represented in this film, so most people will be able to relate.  Some may be taken aback by the drinking and drug use (marijuana plays a large role in this film), so, as usual, parental guidance is necessary.  If you like to feel like you were transported to another era or you want to relive your high school experience, you should watch this film.

The book that comes with the DVD is an interesting read, and I enjoyed learning little tidbits about how the director (Richard Linklater) found that high school/70's vibe.  The documentary that is part of the set is adequate, and it's the reason my rating slipped down to 4 stars.  I thought there would be more to the documentary.",1268006400,,1093,4.402985074626866

I had the regular version, had actually completely forgotten about this movie and then for some reason decided to watch it one day and fell in love all over again.  Went online to get more information and found this.  I had it sent to me in Japan and it was the best 50$ I have spent in a while (postage etc).
The movie and extras more than lived up to expectations.  The second disc has a ton of interviews, both from the time of shooting and the 10 year 'reunion'.  Everyone is classically young and somewhat normal at the cusp of some great careers.  They are casual, cocky, tired, nervous, but at the heart of it all entertaining.  The deleted scenes were interesting to see and in my opinion the right ones to cut.  You can see the attempt to build more character development but that would have definitely changed the tone of the movie.
The book is v. interesting and insightful with some great 'essays' written about the movie, the cast, and more importantly the time that that this movie attempted to portray.  It did all the things it was meant to do; remind me of my school days, make me nostalgic for lost youth and wonder where all the friends I had lost touch with ended up, made me want to ride shotgun in my boyfriends sexy muscle car, made me want to smoke that joint.

2552966,5,B000F6IHSG,"Richard Linklater's first picture, SLACKER, made on a shoestring, earned him a lot of attention, and he somehow managed to persuade Universal Pictures to spend $6 million on his sophomore effort, DAZED & CONFUSED, which follows a group of two dozen suburban Texas kids on the last day of high school in 1976. The studio that financed AMERICAN GRAFFITI several years before may have been hoping that lightning would strike again, and indeed there are intriguing similarities between the two movies. Both of them are ensemble pieces introducing a slew of talented young actors; both observe the cruising and dating rituals of a diverse gang of kids on a single afternoon and night; both feature wall-to-wall scores of golden oldies.

But the differences between the two movies are striking as well. AMERICAN GRAFFITI, set in 1962, was a chronicle of the last days of innocence. In DAZED & CONFUSED, innocence is already long gone. These kids, some of them as young as 14 or 15, booze it up, smoke dope, search for sex, and speak in a rush of profanities that might make the characters in a Scorsese movie blush, Unlike the idealistic kids in GRAFFITI, these teenage slackers are aimless and nihilistic. The film is more honest than George Lucas's reminiscence in acknowledging the tensions among the different cliques of high school kids, and it's psychologically perceptive about their conflicting impulses toward conformity and defiance. Linklater's alter ego, the incoming freshman Mitch (Wiley Wiggins), is flattered by the attention he gets from the older jocks even while he despises their infantile high jinks.

The performances are persuasive down to the smallest part, and Linklater has a fine ear for the unexpectedly loopy turns of phrase that make these teenagers come to life. He renders all of them -- the drugged out space cadet, the vascillating quarterback, the goons who take an almost psychotic relish in paddling freshman, the nerdy intellectual and the budding feminist -- with wit and affection. To anyone from the AMERICAN GRAFFITI generation, the teenagers in DAZED & CONFUSED may seem as alien as a band of Martians, but Linklater's passionate concern for the clan he's conjured should keep everyone mesmerized.",1210291200,,2234,5.117808219178082

2552968,5,B000F6IHSG,"As a graduate of 1977, this movie has a lot of memories for me, being the same age as the Dazed and Confused gang here.
After watching the movie and relating to everything, except the girls' hazing, I realized that I had to buy the movie, which I did, the criterion collection.
Seeing the antics, getting a buzz behind the school, the party in the woods, and especially the clothes, brought me back to a great and fun time in my life, that I THOUGHT I wouldn't miss, but I do.
 The music is pretty awesome ( except for Peter Frampton ), it really clicks with the movie.

 I watch this movie about every couple of months or so, and still crack up at Slater. So many people I knew that was just like him.
The criterion collection has that extra dvd that has the typical behind the scenes type of clips, such as deleted scenes, the actors tryouts for the part, interviews, Richard Linkletter's comments and interview, the reunion ( which there isn't much to speak of ) and so on.
It also comes with a book that was put together pretty well as  far as bringing the characters to life if you will.
The criterion collection wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be, but I'm glad I got it just the same. To me it's worth having as an extra to watch once in a blue moon.
This movie has become a cult classic for almost everyone, especially for the ""kids"" that have reached their late forties to early fifties.",1193702400,4,1407,4.318181818181818

2552970,5,B000F6IHSG,"True-to-life, intelligent, often hilarious movie wins you over with its sheer exuberance and dead-on recreation of the wild and wooly seventies. Director Linklater satirizes the period with considerable affection, so we feel nostalgia for a period many of us thought (at the time) was a mediocre follow-up to the swinging sixties. Terrific line-up of seventies rock classics and those distinctive cars add pungent flavor. Posey and Affleck are terrific, but in truth, so is entire lesser-known cast. Ideal double feature with ""American Graffiti"" or ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"". Fun, with capital letters.",1184112000,2,607,5.537634408602151
2552971,4,B000F6IHSG,"I moved to Austin, Texas in June 1976.  This movie is supposedly set in Austin during that time, but I think it fits more into West Texas. I don't think the hazing and the guns portrayed here were characteristic of Austin, which was a sleepy little college and state government town in 1976.

But the film is a period piece, which is a favorite genre for me and one has the chance to see if the producer/director gets things right, whether it's clothes, hairstyles, cars, etc. or whatever.  Here they get most of that right.  The ""muscle cars"" again suggest West Texas more than Austin; so does the football and the hazing.  ""Slacker"" is explicitly set in Austin, and I recognize scenes from thirty years ago in that movie.  But I need to check on this, because the ""moonlight towers"" scene here suggests that the movie is set in Austin.  (Alas, I think those are gone now, as are some other landmarks.)

One of the most interesting things about this film is that actors like Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey are big stars now, but Wiley Wiggins steals every scene here, and BA and MM are cardboard characters.  And the director failed to elicit some kind of ambiguity about the Affleck character.  Why does he want to go around spanking these young boys?
Was this kind of hazing really a tradition at the school or what?  Then again, the '70s were pretty free for kids compared to what we see today.

I think Wiggins in this movie is easily the best actor.  And he is the central character.  He doesn't have Jason London's classic good looks, but he has those ""geeky"" good looks that remind one of high school reunions where people see a classmate in a new light and wonder how anyone could have overlooked guys or girls who were maybe not that ""popular"" but who were really cool at the time and not that many people noticed.  And like those kids, ""Mitch"", the Wiggins character here, is trying to figure out how he fits in or if he does, so the film reminds you maybe of yourself or of kids you knew who struggled.

You know the type.  Maybe you were the type.  So in a way, this movie is kind of like ""Ridgmont High"" meets ""The Wonder Years"".

Let's hope to see more of Wiggins; he's apparently still active in Austin, which is a great city but not as cool in some ways as it was thirty years ago.  And thanks to stuff like cell phones, kids don't have the kind of adventures and fun they did back then, in Austin or anywhere.",1180396800,2,2432,4.410313901345291
2552972,5,B000F6IHSG,"For those who don't think current-day teenagers would hit it off well with a movie about the last day of high school in 1976, think again. I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and have seen it four times since.

The themes in teenage life now are the same as they were then - rebellion and conformity, drugs, clashes with authority, the search for freedom and the testing of boundaries, the cliques of high school - and every viewer can find a character to identify with in ""Dazed and Confused"". We meet a diverse cast of stoners, jocks, nerds, newly inaugurated seniors, the freshest of freshmen, and we take an all too brief journey with them through the activities of the last day of school in 1976. It's just a snapshot of their life, but it's a vivid snapshot and it's one I never tire of looking at.

Randall ""Pink"" Floyd (Jason London) is as close to a protagonist as we get in this ensemble cast. He's a football player and an all-round good guy who slips effortlessly in and out of the different cliques. He smokes with the stoners, plays football with the jocks, shoots pool with the nerds, and takes pity on freshman Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) who as the brother of one of the senior girls, is the target of the jocks' fury.

Memorable performances come from every single member of this cast - Anthony Rapp, Adam Goldberg and Marissa Ribisi as geeks Tony, Mike and Cynthia, Ben Affleck doing a thoroughly amusing turn as O'Bannion (a football player who deliberately failed his exams so he could be a senior for two years in a row), Cole Hauser as jock Benny, Shawn Andrews as the school dealer Kevin, Wiley Wiggins as Mitch, and Sasha Jenson as Pink's best friend Don, among others.

For me, however, the shining stars here are Jason London himself, Rory Cochrane as stoner Slater, and Matthew McConaughey as Wooderson, that guy who leaves high school but just never seems to grow out of hanging out with teenagers. Jason London handles the struggle with his coach's blatant attempt at control - all football players must sign a commitment not to drink, smoke or engage in any other activities which might prevent them from performing at their best - just right, and by halfway through the movie you wish this guy was your best friend. McConaughey has some of the best lines in his movie, including the notorious and oft-quoted, ""That's what I love about these high-school girls. I get older, they stay the same age,"" and of course his motto, ""Just keep livin'. L-i-v-i-n."" His Wooderson is slightly sleazy but never creepy and always very cool, and it's a shame that McConaughey made so many bad career choices after this movie, because it's clear here that he has real talent.

And Slater? Rory Cochrane turns the stoner archetype into a character I would personally love to take on a roadtrip. From the largely improvised Martha Washington speech to the way he laughs at the hazing of the freshmen, Cochrane has Slater - who is high on pot (and who also drops acid at one point) for the entire movie - down perfectly. Granted, we have the long hair and the constant use of ""man"", but in Cochrane's capable hands what could be a cliche is turned into a likable, unbelievably cool, REAL character.

If you want a feel-good seventies movie with good old-fashioned freshman hazing, a party, a fight, beer, and pot, this is your movie. If you want a philosophical look at high school and the uncertainty of the future, this is your movie. If you want a character study of a realistic cross-section of the teenage population, this is your movie.

What are you waiting for? Buy this movie. You won't regret it.",1179964800,3,3627,4.622670807453416
2552973,5,B000F6IHSG,"Texas, May 1976. It's the last day of school, which means the rising high school seniors will be busy hazing the rising freshmen amidst drinking, smoking dope, and trying to get laid. ""Dazed and Confused,"" considered by some to be the greatest high school/'70s comedy of all-time, follows the lives of these students during a memorable 24-hour period.

Like many of Richard Linklater's films, ""Dazed And Confused"" is an ensemble piece with little plot. But the film's lack of plot actually works to its advantage because it gives the film a more naturalistic feel. Randall ""Pink"" Floyd (Jason London) is a star football player and rising senior trying to decide whether to play by team rules or rebel -- not to mention wondering where his life fits in the big scheme of things. Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) is a rising freshman trying to avoid a beatdown from Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck) and his cronies, while also finding romance, attempting to buy his first underage beer, and trying to fit in with an older crew.

Dazed is filled with notable cameos and characters, including Joey Lauren Adams (""Chasing Amy"") and Parker Posey as bitchy rising seniors who delight in hazing the younger women, Adam Goldberg in classic nerd form, Matthew McConaughy as a post-grad pothead, and Rory Cochrane & Sasha Jenson as Pink's jock friends.

Among the talented cast, Wiggins, Affleck and McConaughey stand out. Wiggins feels authentic as the gawky freshman trying to fit in. As the idiotic O'Bannion, Affleck hilariously captures the meathead mentality. But the real star is McConaughey in an uproarious role as smooth stoner David Wooderson. After this breakout flick, McConaughey soon became a Hollywood heartthrob and saw his career regress due to poor role choices and miserable miscasting. Here, though, he exudes charisma and steals scene after scene with lines like, ""That's what I like about these high school girls, I keep getting older, they stay the same age.""

""Dazed"" will undoubtedly have you reminsincing about the glorious high school years. But Linklater also invests the film with some subtle philosophical questions that are surprising to find in a nostalgic comedy like this. After a wild night of partying, Pink remarks to his friends, ""All I'm saying is that if I ever start referring to these as the best years of my life -- remind me to kill myself."" Interesting food for thought.

""Dazed and Confused"" has gained a well-deserved cult following as one of the greatest party films of all-time. Lack of plot aside, this is a riotously entertaining flick that's guaranteed to generate a ton of laughs and get you into the party spirit.",1179446400,,2649,4.9977324263038545

2552986,4,B000F6IHSG,"When I heard two years ago, or so, that Universal was releasing a ""collectors"" edition of ""Dazed and Confused"", I was pretty psyched. I am a huge fan of Richard Linklater and almost all if his films(with the exception of the lackluster ""Newton Boys"" and decent but not necessary ""Bad News Bears"" remake), so I was excited to see a verison of the movie with interviews with the expnasive cast, commentaries, all the bells and whistles...

And then when the ""Flashback Edition"" was released, I was immediatly dissapointed. The transfer was crappy, there were no bonus features worth watching, the packaging was ugly and unispired. I just assumed that ""Dazed"" was the one Linklater movie that was not going to permanetly reside in my DVD collection(not including of course the aforementioned ""Boys"" and ""Bears"".)

Well I'm here to tell you ""Dazed"" and Linklater fans, Criterion has done their typically exceptional job on this 2-Disc edition in every way that Universal failed just eighteen months previous.

The packaging is excellent, with an extensive booklet made to look like a high school booklet that features excellent essays and interviews with the cast and Linklater. The picture quality this time is top notch, and the commentary that Linklater delivers is informative without being dull, and the extras, which includes deleted scenes, trailors, the ""Making Dazed"" doc that permiered on AMC a year or so ago, auditions and clips from the big ten year anniversary show, are well done. If you are a fan of the movie and want more then this is the best way to go.

The only reason I give this set four stars instead of the five that it probably deserves is because I think the movie itself is a four star picture, an excellent look at high school and the boredom thereof that I think has probably been misread over the years a little(a video package that included this and the Dave Chappelle comedy ""Half Baked"" only confirmed this). It is a strong picture in my opinion, but not perfect.

For fans of the movie or for fans of the directors other stuff(I hope Criterion continues to work with Linklater on films such as ""Before Sunrise/ Sunset"" and ""Waking Life"", because along with this and ""Slacker"" they've made me want more)will finally get a version of this excellent movie that is worth adding to your collection.",1155600000,4,2324,4.843828715365239

So many stars (whether of the blockbuster sort or the indie sort) got their start in this inconspicuous look at the first day of summer in a small Texas town in 1976, where the seniors haze the freshman, everyone is out to score a little weed, and the opposite sex never looked so good.  Sure, there's little plot to speak of, save the rather hackneyed decision of Pink not to sign the pledge to his team, but there are so many classic lines, mostly courtesy of Wooderson, so much attention to detail in the muscle cars, clothing, and slang, not to mention wall to wall 70s rock classics...bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, KISS, Black Oak Arkansas, Aerosmith, plus more ""obscure"" songs by War, Sweet, Head East, and Dr. John.

As already mentioned, Criterion has put out the definitive 2 disc edition, complete with a truly superior picture, commentary by the director, 13 deleted scenes (many of which are really good), and then an hour long making of documentary.",1154217600,6,1645,4.8120567375886525
2552989,5,B000F6IHSG,"What an incredible DVD. Dazed and Confused will always stand as one of the most realistic portrayals of high schoolers on the cusp of adulthood. But now you get to see the story behind the scenes. In the Extras, Richard Linklater talks about fighting to keep one of the key elements in the film, the soundtrack that defines a generation. We find out how the characters were drawn and see several actor auditions. I especially liked the stories of how Matthew McConaughey and Wiley Wiggins were chosen for their roles. The book that accompanies the DVD features articles by film and rock and roll journalists and quotes from the actors. I graduated from high school in 1976 and I recognize pretty much every rite of passage and cultural symbol. As a former DJ, my husband hates when a film misplaces music and he says this is one of the most accurate soundtracks he's seen in film. The Dazed and Confused poster that comes with the DVD hangs proudly on the wall of my home business. As Slater would say, ""That's what I'm talkin' about.""",1153872000,4,1035,4.630434782608695

2552993,5,B000F6IHSG,"So great to see this movie finally get the attention it deserves.  Linklater captured a moment in time, much the same way Lucas had done with American Graffiti, fusing together the music, the clothes, the cars and the attitudes of the mid 70's.  It was a sleeper hit at the time, but has become a cult classic thanks to the stature many of these actors have since achieved.  But, what really makes this movie work is Linklater's incredible eye for detail, from the pictures pasted to the locker doors to the egg stereo chair to the wry send up of the bicentennial year by one of the homeroom teachers.  This movie is a time capsule of an era.

The characters are drawn from his experiences, to the point he even took many of the same names.  How else could one come up with Randall ""Pink"" Floyd, the antihero of this film who refuses to sign a paper that demands he won't partake in any illegal extra-curricular activities.  Friends matter more than rules in this movie, which was the way it was for many of us at that time.  Oddly enough the quintessential song from which this movie draws its title is never heard, but it sure is felt.",1151625600,14,1137,4.4326923076923075
2552994,2,B000F6IHSG,"Criterion did a nice job of packaging this movie.  A beautiful transfer, booklet and poster.  Problem is, the movie is awful.  After reading a few other reviews, i feel like the odd man out.  A coming of age movie of the 70s that is better, and deeply portrayed by the 70's tv show.  The movie must be regional, as we didn't have Junior High to High School hazing.  Especially not the type portrayed in this film.  The rest of the movie is about drinking, getting high and partying, which is fine, but covered better in other movies.  Oddly missing is the sex which is prevalent in any hormone crazed decade of teenagers.  It's almost handled in a politically correct manner as the local predator got a phone number during a party rather than take advantage of the red heads vulnerability.  Or the scene where this couple are making out, he was reminded of having a girlfriend then stops, and walks away.  Like THAT scene is even remotely accurate.  The soundtrack is loud, and a sample of very average ""classic"" rock hits.  By now, the music loses it's impact because the songs have been played to death by it's corporate owners.  Did this movie succeed in bring me back to the ""good old days""?  Not even remotely.  To catch better examples of coming to age movies that capture the mood along with better dialogue and acting, check out Rivers Edge, Swinging Cheerleaders and Repo Man (all very different approaches to teen culture, but much more realistic).  Plenty of used copies for sale which indicates to me there are at least a few who share my sentiments.",1150934400,6,1562,4.621818181818182
2552995,5,B000F6IHSG,"Ok, I give up.

I've been trying to write an intelligent, thoughtful, clever review of this movie for over two weeks now. And I can't seem to pull it off.

So you'll just have to trust me when I say that Dazed and Confused is a classic.

If you've already seen it, you know what I mean. If you haven't, what the hell are you waiting for?

The Criterion Criterion, as always, does a bang-up job on the DVD. There are bonus features galore, and even a Dazed and Confused poster to put in your locker at school.

But bonus features or no bonus features, just see this movie. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, steal it, whatever you need to do. Watch it again, if it's been a while.

And never forget the immortal words of Wooderson:

8117886,5,B000F6IHSG,"the criterion blu ray , blows away the other blu ray edition in quality in picture and sound.  It has many great extras too.
The movie itself captures a long ago time when teens were not into gangs and crap but instead just wanted to party and NOT grow up. But they would have to do that and let the weed go or stay idiots.  The films is well made with many good actors in it and it's just a fun flick. It's not a deep movie or a drama , it's just about group of teens from that period. Ironically all the actors in this film are in their fortiies or late 30's.  but at the time the seventies were not that far gone and this really depicted the mindless partying of the era in a fun way. So grab this one and remember the seventies don't suck half as bad as the crappy music and youth scene of today.  man,  how about smiling teens?  so grab this one for a trip into the smokey past.",1449792000,,883,3.9604519774011298
