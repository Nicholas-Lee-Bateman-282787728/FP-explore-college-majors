6478698,3,B00LAYEN4Y,"We bought through amazon on demand (apparently ahead of DVD release?). Was a bit disappointed. It just didn't have the same charisma and charm as some of the other movies (e.g King of the Railway, Misty Island Rescue, Blue Mountain Mystery). My son watched it, but not with a great deal of interest (like he has for the others).",1410480000,16,328,4.576271186440678
6478699,4,B00LAYEN4Y,"This movie was great. Percy is the main character just like in Day of the Diesels but this Percy is way better here, especially when he saved James from the landslide at the claypits. I'm glad Bill and Ben got a big role because they are good characters. Gator is the main new character in the movie and he is very good and his personality is great. Marion was very funny. Timothy and Reg are not too interesting. The scene where Cranky catches the ship is unrealistic and James was far too harsh to Percy in the movie but this movie was still alright. The songs are good. This a very action packed and heart warming movie and is one of the best Thomas movies. Still not the best Thomas movie.",1505606400,,693,4.297709923664122

6478715,3,B00LAYEN4Y,This is a great movie. My boys love it. We bought it digitally on prime. My only complaint is that Amazon inserted an ad during the movie for one of their Amazon Original shows. People were screaming about cutting off fingers. It was a mad scramble for the remote. Why the heck do I buy a movie and then have to watch an ad much less one that is inappropriate for the audience?!,1484870400,2,378,4.191780821917808

6478754,5,B00LAYEN4Y,"ended up buying the DVD so we could watch all the time. Such a cute movie and my kids love it. If you don't want your kids to learn about things being ""scary"" you won't like this movie. It's not particularly scary itself, but they talk about being scared a lot, and there is a ""Monsters Everywhere"" song that we think is cute, but a lot of parents may not be a fan of it. I would recommend you check out the little music video on youtube before you purchase and watch with your children if that is a concern. If not, this is a super cute movie that teaches bravery, and that its okay to be scared. ""You can be scared and still be brave...""",1450483200,,639,4.079365079365079

6478763,1,B00LAYEN4Y,"My 2 year old loves Thomas series and has lots of trains and DVDs. Although this dvd is a good story and a good quality animation however it may not be proper for younger kids. The problem is that it introduces the concept of ""monster"" for the younger kids and that may cause problems later as it happened for us. Our toddler now is scared of sleeping in his room alone while before this was never an issue! Although we won't let him watch this dvd again, and even after a couple months, the idea of monster is already in his head and probably won't go away. Something to consider for those of you whose toddlers already don't want to go to bed at night!!",1442275200,3,655,4.248

Well, let's be real, I might if it was on repeat all day. But, since it was a treat, it's been refreshing!

Thomas is 98% of what my kiddo likes. Tale of the Brave was so different! New songs, new animation, new engines.. All around great! I see how kids could get scared, but in our home we tend to talk most of those ""scary"" situations down as they happen. For example ""What are those foot prints?! Oh my, what a big animal it must have been to have made those"" or ""Landslide!! They better go fast, fast, fast!! I'm sure glad that Thomas has friends to help him!!!"". It's always worked for us, & made the movies enjoyable.

I really hope to see more Thomas films like this in the future. So much fun!",1423440000,,875,4.111111111111111

It's a fun new story where Thomas finds a fossil and doesn't know what it is but everyone believes the footprints belong to a monster. Percy becomes afraid and convinced there's a monster and there's a little story that goes on with that too. I won't go into too much detail so I don't ruin the story but I will say it's a great one!

He was so excited to watch it but he quickly changed his mind. Parts of the movie freaked him out (he's been talking a lot more about scary haunted houses and monsters) and the rest is pretty boring. He only asked to watch it once. We still watch King of the Railway and Blue Mountain Mystery on a daily basis but Tale of the Brave was a let down. I'm glad we didn't save it for Xmas now!",1414627200,3,560,3.9646017699115044
6478849,5,B00LAYEN4Y,"Last night my 3 year old son and his 3 year old female friend had a movie night to watch Tale of the Brave graciously provided to our family as a free promotion from BzzAgent and Fisher Price.

We own many Thomas DVDs, though only a few of the actual full length movies.  My son is just learning to sit through longer movies rather than short 20-30 minute cartoon shows and I wasn't sure whether this would capture his interest for the full hour length of the film.  To my surprise, he and his friend sat and watched the entire movie.  Though not Halloween themed, the movie is actually just in time for this spooky holiday because there are several scary (but age appropriate) suspenseful scenes and talk about monsters on Sodor.  The kids really got a kick out of this and even my 6 year old son popped into and stayed in the room for those portions.  I was also uncertain whether this movie would hold the attention of his female friend, but she was just as captivated by it.

I also appreciate that there is a good message to kids so they do benefit from the social-emotional aspects of the movie and it  has more to offer than just pure entertainment.  For the Amazon price of about $15, I think it is in line with what we've paid for past Thomas movies and I would easily be on board purchasing this for a birthday gift for a Thomas fan.",1414195200,2,1343,4.318725099601593

It's all standard Thomas stuff, and to be honest, felt a bit flat like they were running out of ideas. On the other hand, our 3 year old son seemed to like it as much as previous Thomas adventures and has watched it several times. It's not bad by any means, but doesn't have anything like the charm of, say, Misty Island Rescue or King Of The Railway.",1413676800,5,502,4.351063829787234

6478867,5,B00LAYEN4Y,"Andrew Brenner has done a magnificent job with Thomas and Friends ever since he became the head writer for season 17 of the program that I grew up watching as a child. Like I said before, it is not only entertaining for the kids, but it goes the same for fans young or old.",1412121600,,273,4.074074074074074
6478868,5,B00LAYEN4Y,"I've seen this movie many times with a DVD from the UK and as well as the American version. I praise this movie full on because of its morals and storyline. Kids need to understand that as we grow up there'll be thing in life that fears us, despite that we can be brave we can't be brave all the time, and this year's special shows that with its moral 'Being brave isn't the same as not being scared, it's about what you do even when you do feel scared.' In simpler term, 'You can be scared and still be brave.'

The storyline is not boring anyway, we are seeing the struggle of Percy's fear that he has during the whole movie and a child can be like that in real life. The DVD special is more better then the previous ones and trust me there are ones like Misty Island Rescue and Day of The Diesels that have very poor moralisations. While MIR shows that we can't always be right, but there are some major flaws (e.g - Thomas crossing the shake shake bridge, Thomas having common sense that the bridge is unsafe and that they must not use it. But the logging locos forced Thomas to cross the bridge as they have the logs and that common sense was thrown right out of the window! Seriously how is that good for kids? 'Understand the dangers, but screw you have no other way'. DOTD is nothing more then 60 minutes of Percy moping about Thomas not paying attention to him. Sure that film has the moral 'no matter who or what you are, you are all the same.' when really Calling All Engines! shared the exact same moral. But the main hero of that special, Percy, gave out a poor message. He was cross with Thomas for not paying attention to him!)

Plus the special isn't THAT dark, if you want dark watch 'Duncan Gets Spooked' or 'Toby's Discovery'. The climax has to be there and the plot has to show the morality of bravery in some way, e.g - Cranky stopping the ship and Percy rescuing James at the china clay pits, you can't sugarcoat it all the time, which is why I don't like parents wrapping their kids in cotton wool. Some day a child will have to grow up and understand fear, it helps them growing up and this special is definitely an example of that.",1411862400,3,2156,4.2560975609756095

6478878,3,B00LAYEN4Y,"My son loves all of the Thomas movies, but this is the first one that is a bit scary for him.  He is two years old so on the younger end of the targeted Thomas market.  The crux of the movie is the engines are learning to be brave by overcoming fear of monsters.  There are a few scenes where the engines think they are seeing monsters and chuff off scared, and another segment where a song about ""monsters, monsters everywhere"" plays showing everyday objects that at night appear to look like monsters.  My husband and I were a bit surprised to see a mildly intense Thomas movie since all of the other movies are fluff.",1411689600,,620,4.318965517241379

It's not terrible or anything.....just pretty by-the-book. Honestly, it felt like they either ran out of ideas or are just coasting on the Thomas popularity. The whole family felt a little let down.",1411430400,3,374,4.769230769230769
6478882,2,B00LAYEN4Y,"I agree with the other reviewers - this one is darker and a little scarier than the rest. My son got very upset when Cranky was nearly pulled in the water. He started screaming and crying, saying he didn't want to watch it any more. I had to talk him through it, and he did sit and watch the rest. But he hasn't asked to watch it again which is really unusual. He watched all of the other Thomas movies a million times in a row until he had them memorized when they were new.

He absolutely adores all the other movies like Hero of the Rails, Blue Mountain Mystery and Misty Island Rescue...this movie, however, falls short of all the others greatness.  Half of it is quite boring, while the other half is sometimes a bit scary.  The whole dinosaur theme is a bit weird as well-the story does not flow as well as the other Thomas movies.  Also, all the other Thomas movies have great soundtracks-my son loves when I sing Blue Mountain Mystery, for instance, but the soundtrack for this movie is actually quite horrible...the songs do not engage my son, and frankly, I dislike them as well.",1411344000,11,695,4.626016260162602

6478900,3,B00LAYEN4Y,"If Will Ferrell had voiced Gator, it would be a solid 5 for that alone... This movie is just as annoying as the rest of them and trust me I've seen them all multiple times. The story just felt like it was missing something (not like any of the others belong on Masterpiece Theater but still.) The songs are catchy in the fact that when us parents subjected to too much Thomas end up in padded cells we will probably be singing ""lalalalalalalalala let's be brave."" Saying the movie is scary is relative to your kid I think, mine loves monsters and Halloween so this was nothing.  I have a 2.5 year old boy and I've had to watch the ""Monster"" Song in the bonus features about 20 times in the last 2 days. He liked the spooky music video better than the movie I think. Listen, we all know Thomas and his friends suck at being really useful. I bet once old Bertram finally kicks it from a stress-induced heart attack, Lady Hatt will scrap them all and start playing house with Sir Robert. Until then, us sucker parents will keep paying the Thomas machine to turn out more crap (don't get me started on the day out with Tomas experience) because our kiddos love it and we love them.",1410998400,12,1177,4.32579185520362

He wasn't in the mood to watch this film yet until I read one of the reviews to him that it was scary. He wanted to see it right away! I would say its more exciting than scary, but it kept him focused and surprised. Can't get really scary with Thomas, it's more of excitement for example ""who is coming down the track in the dark, I can't see who it is, oh it's so and so"" or ""who's foot print is this oh no I have to figure it out"" nothing terrifying. I think it does a good job at explaining bravery. We found the film entertaining and it's a current favorite.

Last year's movie King of the Railway was great so we hoped this one would be better. We have watched King of the Railway a million times but I doubt we watch this one ever again.
