7920089,5,B00004CNQN,"Not much more need be said of this film; it is a completely charming exhibition by Ronald Colman, than whom there have been few more delightful performers. The material is admirably suited to his talents at this point  in his career, a movie that needed to add little to what is so clearly a perfect fit to the small stage of a contemporary theater. Co-starred, Loretta Young is charmingly supportive of the more dynamic male role, while Myrna Loy, almost unrecognizable, is allowed (rare in that period) to exhibit just a bit of the piquancy that soon made her a top star. The remainder of the cast is admirable in their roles, carrying off this, oh, so, English, trifle, with very real flair.
I was given a copy of this hour or so entertainment by a friend who knew the pleasure it would bring; hopefully, for the sake of the many to whom it would bring pleasure, Amazon will be able to bring this into its stable of films on demand.",1352419200,,935,4.4678362573099415
7920090,5,B00004CNQN,"Just this evening at 7:30pm I saw this movie on the silver screen in the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto CA.  It is a wonderful fast moving romantic farce that is charming and cute.  As one of the pre-Hollywood code the story does not have to dance around the strange rules that the Hollywood code censored on all Americans.  The pre-code movies are what American movies should have been before we started to be told what to think and what we could see.  Not that this movie is anythin compared to todays sex and violence - but it is light and funny and lots of fun.

The movie starts out in Kenya with Willy selling all his possessions that his rich father had given him 2 years before after not being able to make a go of it in East Africa.  His many friends are all willing to buy his items for more money than he paid for them but he has none of it and gives most of them away.  Cut back to England where the rest of the family is reading of Willy's return in the paper, and his father vows never to be taken advantage of by his wastrel son again and to throw him out if he shows up the doorstep.

Willy returns and send him baggage on ahead of him so the family can take out their anger and criticism on the baggage while he visits his old girlfriend for the evening.  When he finally does come home he and his sister's best friend meet and the fireworks start and explode that evening at her engagement party.

The movie is really a classic and shows that these old movies can stand up to time and be just as good or better than anything out today.

I'd love to find a copy of this on VHS or DVD and I hope this one and other pre-code movies get released so Americans/Brits can enjoy their real cinematic heritage ... which might lead to demand of better movies today.

If you get the chance, see it.  5/5.",1329177600,2,1810,4.151862464183381
7920091,4,B00004CNQN,"United Artists presents ""THE DEVIL TO PAY!"" (1930) (72 min/B&W) -- Starring Ronald Colman, Frederick Kerr, Loretta Young, David Torrence & Myrna Loy

Directed by George Fitzmaurice

Willie Hale (Ronald Colman) is the ""black sheep"" of a wealthy British family, who sent to South Africa so that he'll be as far away from home as possible. Broke again, Hale auctions off his belongings and heads for London to the less-than-open arms of his father, Lord Leland (Frederick Kerr). He begins to dally with saucy actress Mary Crayle (Myrna Loy), but soon his attentions shift to the young heiress Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young), who just happens to be engaged to a nobleman.

Based on a play by Frederick Lonsdale with Ronald Colman: smooth as silk!

The film's original director was Irving Cummings with Dorothy being played by Constance Cummings. After some scenes were shot, George Fitzmaurice replaced Cummings as director, and Loretta Young took over the role of Dorothy, with all previous scenes re-shot.

This is a very entertaining and fun film. Most of this is due to the always genial acting of Ronald Colman, with his likable charming persona. His seemingly effortless style, it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the film!

For fans of Ronald Colman, The Devil To Pay is not to be missed.  Highly recommend!

7920092,3,B00004CNQN,"THE DEVIL TO PAY is a vastly entertaining tale of a rich but incredibly spoiled scion who not only wants his cake but wishes to share slices of it with his admiring friends.  Ronald Colman plays Willie Hale, a mid-thirties playboy who has failed at every job he has had--except that of a playboy.  His father (Frederick Kerr) cannot decide whether to toss his wastrel son out the door or to keep feeding him money for yet another misadventure.  Willie's life is a pleasant and uncomplicated whirl of fun and adventure.  His sister Susan (Florence Britton) thinks the world of him though she too encourages him to ""settle down."" Willie has a showgirl girfriend Mary, played by a blonde-wigged Myrna Loy, who loves him madly and would marry him at the drop of a hat.  Willie's fortunes become complicated when he meets the lovely Dorothy (Loretta Young--who was eighteen in real life to Colman's thirty-nine) and both fall hard for one another.  Director George Fitzmaurice brings in the usual light complications of three and four way relations.  Dorothy is engaged to a snooty but titled Count but dumps him, much to her father's chagrin who wanted royalty in the family.  Willie breaks off with a surprisingly understanding Mary, who accepts her demotion with equanimity.  THE DEVIL TO PAY is a light and frothy comedy that relies on the screen presence of Colman and Young to enliven a plot that might have seemed much reduced in the hands of lesser others.  Still, it is a fun filled film that allows the audience to remain on the light side of relationships that all too often show a snarky attitude.",1254960000,3,1604,4.758122743682311
