Most, if not all, of the series is shown like they are in the camera, i.e. ""REC"" and various lines are shown.  It works great through the whole series and does an even better job, in my opinion, on the last disc.

Rarely do I watch a show and truly feel for a character.  I am not going to go into detail about the end of the series, but if you're this far, you pretty much know a little about how the show will end.  Just like The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, FLAG shows you all of these little details about the characters, but this one is a lot more in your face about it.  This is mainly due to it being a growing/learning experience for the main character, and she basically ""finds"" herself at the end.

Just like Lost, this series boils down to the relationships between the characters, but it focuses on the narrator and the main character instead of every single staff member of the military or journalist.  The last episodes focus more on the resolution and the two main characters than the war itself, and it does rightly so.

The ending shocked me, and I had my first ""Holy Crap""/reflective moment since watching the first season of Code Geass.  I have been watching shows on Netflix while working on my company, and I decided to watch FLAG while eating so I could sit down and put all of my attention to it, and I'm very glad that I did.  It was truly a great ending to a great series.",1318896000,,1531,4.318181818181818
