I don't know if we missed this on the description, but when we put the DVD into three different players (including a computer, DVD, PS4) we received the same encrypted error code -- this are only available to view in Europe. Super unfortunate because we were so excited when we received the DVDs!",1508976000,,322,4.551724137931035

8480844,5,B005O05GKK,"In my opinion this is the best version of the borrowers, if you want a version that is accurate to the books. My local library had a copy of this on VHS and I was very happy to find it on DVD. It's too bad that this disc is not available in the states. I managed to bypass the region restrictions by using MakeMKV to copy the video off of the disc to make my backup copy. If you just want to play the disc use VLC.",1434844800,3,414,3.7701149425287355

8480846,3,B005O05GKK,"Mary Norton's series of books are some of the best family fiction ever to be written. I hold it in higher regard than the OZ books and  Harry Potter. Certainly on a par with Lewis Carrol's ""Alice.""

In 1972 a decent film with Eddie Albert, Tammy Grimes and Dame Judith Anderson was created and it is really quite good. This version is not better- not in performances- there's not a single actor here who holds a candle to the original cast, not in production values or script, but this film was made with aspect rations for regions 2 and 4 ONLY, so unless your DVD player reads those formats then skip this and go with the 1972 version.

Or better yet, turn off the tube and read all five of the books to the family again. ""Poor Stainless"" is a short story-after thought and  the  perfect dessert with which to surprise everyone when they are sincerely sad that the five original books are finished. You will ALL have a good time. By involving the entire family your own house can become home to Borrowers, since every house has small tid-bits that turn up missing. (I have a cat who takes my keys opff the hook over my desk every night and hides them behind the sink in the downstairs W.C.) You can add to these wonders for your children and by using the same tongue and cheek attitude as Norton (MRs. MAy) does, you won;t necessarily lie to them. And besides, who is to say these tiny people DON'T exist?

They just aren;t real enough in this particular film.

This version is respectful of Mary Norton where the two films that followed it were not (The John Goodman film is not only an insult to Norton and her followers but easily John Goodman's lowest point-lower than The FLintstones- given he's one of the finest actors alive.) The masters from which this DVD was made were clearly poorly stored and effecvted by air, dust, heat and huymidity and one can see that it's of poor visual quality. This element doesn;t bother me as it does many people- I'm in no hurry to see blue ray and a 1970's digitized sitcom is just fine with me. I do appreciate the spectacle that is created by modern technology in film, but to me the absolute most important element is the script followed by the performances. If these are missing then I don;t care if Alfred Hitchcock rose from the dead with modern day D.P's and CGI, I just don;t care.

Ian Holm is a decent actor and he ddoes a nice job here, those his characterization of Pod is a biut more stern than both Mary Norton's and Eddie Albert's. This particular Arriety LOOKS more appropriate, though we've yet to see the curly headed, slender waif who was created by Beth and Joe Krush and let's be honest: that's really what we're waiting for, Christmas, June or Autumn. Given what can be done with motion pictures our only hope now is that tim Burton decides to understake tyhis project. The only trouble is that I don;t see a role for Johnny Depp other than Mrs. Crampfurl.",1392681600,2,2921,4.467166979362101
8480847,2,B005O05GKK,lousy picture-very grainy and the sound is below standard-I was very disappointed with this DVD --must be copied off A VHS-that's how bad it is,1371081600,2,143,4.76
8480848,5,B005O05GKK,"I was delighted to finally find this series on DVD. I ordered it on tape when it first aired. This version is the best by far, and I have watched it many times. I would recommend it to all who enjoy a good story.",1360281600,4,212,3.840909090909091
