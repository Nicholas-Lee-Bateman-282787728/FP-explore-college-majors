7922057,5,B00004STHB,"Pop this DVD into your DVD player and take a family-friendly, entertaining, and more importantly educational adventure across Canada and 3 times zones.  This BIG Adventure begins with Union Station and the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, Canada.

As with all of the Little Mammoth BIG Adventure episodes, a child narrator is your guide.  Educational concepts are introduced to children (and parents/ educators) via simple graphics such as a map of Canada and the upcoming train route, a ""weight"" that ""drops-in,"" or animated examples of how many car tanks of gasoline it would take to fuel the 2 massive train diesel engines.

As the adventure begins, children get a sense of the excitement and flurry of activity that goes into preparing for a big train trip (one lasting 3 days and 3 nights in this case).  See such jobs in action as:

* Hotel Check-In Staff
* Hotel Bellhop (who takes you and your luggage across the street to Union Station)
* Union Station ""Red Caps"" who take your luggage to the train Baggage Car
* Train Engineer
* Train Yard Manager
* Train Maintenance Crew
* Train Conductor
* Train Dining Car Servers, Chef and Kitchen Staff
* Train Cabin Crews (who prepare the beds and cabins for passengers)
* Train Control Room (operating much like Air Traffic Control)
* and more...

Besides enjoying the splendid scenery passing by the windows, the occasional freight train and wildlife, at one point in the video you hear a personal story from one of the Engineer's who is a 3rd generation ""train man"" and get a glimpse into the history of the railroad with historic footage and photos.  As a bonus, there is a brief mention of the ""Doppler effect"" with a diagram and on screen with audio sample of the effect that will stick with children who are attentive.",1224720000,4,1771,4.7272727272727275
7922058,5,B00004STHB,"I purchased this video for my son because he's IN LOVE with trains. After watching a few Thomas the Tank Engine shows I decided not to let him watch it anymore (They were either teasing each other or being just plain mean to each other, a behavior I didn't want my 2yr old to repeat) and I started looking for train video's online. I chose this one because it was on sale and I love Small-Fry video's, my son has a TON of them and loves them all. This was an excellent choice. It shows you a trip across Canada in the train car. From waking up and eating in the train's resteraunt to going to sleep in the bunk beds. Plenty of footage of trains. No annoying songs. A great purchase, I highly recommend this video for little train lovers! I also recommend the Great Plane Trip and and the Big Auto Plant.",1108512000,17,803,4.220779220779221
