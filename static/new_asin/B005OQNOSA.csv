4854391,5,B005OQNOSA,Love the selections and in this economy did not have the cash for the whole box of looney tunes set to blu-ray. Thanks for thinking about all of us,1336176000,3,147,4.103448275862069
4854392,3,B005OQNOSA,"I agree with the customer who said essentially, 'Why can't they get it right?' I have the Volume 1 Platinum Collection. I eagerly await the Volume 2 Platinum Collection. In the meantime it would be nice to have  a collection of more unreleased toons. I am not going to purchase a Collection that contains duplicates of what I already have in the Platinum Collection.

I love the Platinum Collection. These are cartoons I watched on Saturday mornings on TV when I was a kid. They are wonderful to watch again and to enjoy with my grandchildren. But please, please stop duplicating!",1333929600,4,580,4.732673267326732
4854393,1,B005OQNOSA,Can't WB give us more unreleased cartoons? People who would buy a 1 disc Blu ray from the Platinum set will be perfectly happy with the DVDs already in circulation. You guys just can't get it right.,1321315200,11,198,4.378378378378378

8481724,5,B005OQNOSA,I have watched the LOONEY TUNES since I was a child and still enjoy watching them today. I recommend this DVD to all Looney Tune lovers.,1496966400,,136,4.269230769230769
8481725,3,B005OQNOSA,"All of the cartoons contained in this set have been previously released on Blu-Ray and DVD in the LOONEY TUNES PLATINUM COLLECTION VOLUME 1.  No need to buy this and double-up on cartoons.  While it does contain several laugh-out-loud funny cartoons, several of the selected titles are just so-so.  Warner Brothers has so many truly hilarious cartoons to choose from, they should have selected better classics than they did.  Still, all in all, an above average grouping if you missed buying LTPC Vol 1.",1493856000,,503,4.9523809523809526
8481726,5,B005OQNOSA,This was a gift to remind my son of how our Saturday mornings used to be. He loves it.,1415404800,,86,3.5789473684210527
8481727,4,B005OQNOSA,"They don't make them like this anymore!. I grew up watching these cartoons and even today they make me laugh at 55 years old! Nice to have in your collections of films for a ""stress reliever"", trust me, it works. Great pricing for some 40 or so cartoon you get and in Blue Ray!, very clear pictures as if they made them yesterday. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",1390953600,,404,5.328125
8481728,5,B005OQNOSA,"Straight forward, my ""Looney Tunes"" are wonderful. I get to watch REAL cartoons when I want and the purchase was exactly what I needed and at a Great Price. I suggest you don't hesitate to purchase these awsome cartoons.. Stan - Stayk.com",1366070400,,238,4.690476190476191
8481729,5,B005OQNOSA,fast shipping and product was as expected. happy with this purchase. Gave to daughter to let grandson watch some healthy cartoons like I had growing up.,1361923200,,152,4.884615384615385
8481730,3,B005OQNOSA,The product arrived very quickly.  Was exactly as described in advertisement.  Price was very reasonable.  Would recommend to those with children.,1360368000,,146,5.857142857142857
8481731,1,B005OQNOSA,"Unbelievable... I just found out that this disc is the first disc of the Platinum Collection (which has three discs), double dipped in the same sauce, renamed as Showcase. Shame on you, WB, I almost bought this for my child - what a disappointment would have been for him!
I suggest other different names for future releases of the same disc:
""Looney tunes Prime""
""This is Looney Tunes - Vol. 1""
""This is Looney Tunes - Vol. I""
""This is Looney Tunes - Volume One""

Shame on you, Warner Bros. [please note, the second ""Shame on you has the name of the company spelled out, therefore it is a different statement]

This is a case for the BBB.",1359763200,28,639,4.406779661016949
8481732,5,B005OQNOSA,"theirs transfer is excellent,is not grainy there,looks wonderfull.i think is a great showcase because gets 25 cartoons,is fun to watch them,thanks",1356998400,,146,6.0
8481733,4,B005OQNOSA,"So I thought it would be cool to put some Looney Tunes on my media center, and this Blu-ray had the perfect price point. It's got a decent mix of characters in their classic original appearances, as well as a few really iconic shorts like ""Hare Tonic,"" ""Duck Amuck"" (the one where Daffy Duck is quarreling with his animator), and ""What's Opera, Doc?"" There's obviously tons of classics and they couldn't all be on the disc, but this is a decent little collection.

As for the quality, it's pretty good considering these are cartoons from the 40's. The colors are vibrant and the art looks really clean and colors are appropriately flat; the audio is presented in Dolby Digital mono.",1354665600,3,682,4.683333333333334
