3639814,5,B001HNDR40,"Timeless Media finishes the Laredo series with the release of this Season Two, Part Two set. The three DVDs are in slim cases, as was Season Two, Part One. Each episode of the Season Two sets includes the opening credits, possibly because of complaints that the Season One DVDs played the opening credits only as part of the main menu. Both picture and sound are very good for a 40-plus-year-old series. For some reason, the sound is louder on the third disc (#65364 on the spine), at least in my set.
  The thirteen episodes, presented in their original broadcast order, include what is arguably Neville Brand's best showing, ""The Short, Happy Fatherhood of Reese Bennett"". Reese ""adopts"" an orphaned Indian lad, only to encounter unforeseen problems. Brand's performance is touching yet not overly sentimental.
  A bonus feature on Disc One, the first on any Laredo set, is a 25-minute recent interview with co-star Peter Brown, who played Ranger Chad Cooper. Brown talks aboout working with Brand on Laredo and about his career previous to that series.
  The famous spooky house from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" can be seen in the episode, ""The Small Chance Ghost"". It's also shown in the final episode, ""Split the Difference"", but in a different setting, so it isn't as recognizable. This last episode of the series also has the fourth and final appearance of Shelley Morrison as Linda Littletrees.
  Claude Akins appears in three episodes as Ranger Cotton Buckmeister, ""Hey Diddle Diddle"", ""A Question of Guilt,"" and ""Walk Softly"",  sort of a substitute for Neville Brand, who missed several shows. Their characters have been called similar by some but if you watch carefully, the only thing Reese and Cotton have in common is being the butt of the other Rangers' jokes.
  The late great Philip Carey was often underused as Captain Parmalee in this series but check out ""Enemies and Brothers"" for one of his best outings, in which guest star Jack Kelly plays Parmalee's brother, who turns out to be an outlaw.
  William Smith does a good job as Ranger Joe Riley in ""The Bitter Yen of General Ti"", originally written for Brand's Reese character. He saves a Chinese girl from harm and she then declares herself his slave, with the expected complications.
  Robert Wolders as Ranger Erik Hunter is seen to good advantage here more than once. I always liked Erik because his education, European ways and fancy dress spiced up the Old West, rather like Roger Moore's Cousin Beau character in Maverick.
  Other guest stars include Clint Howard, Donald ""Red"" Barry, Kathleen Freeman, Joe Flynn, Carl Ballantine, Jeanette Nolan, Ted Cassidy, Jeanne Cooper, George Furth, and Barbara Anderson, who at the end of ""The Other Cheek"" gives one of the sexiest winks ever seen on television.
  Several years ago, a knowledgeable person in the entertainment industry told me Laredo would NEVER be released on DVD. I'm happy she was wrong.",1235606400,18,2927,4.973305954825462

8309142,5,B001HNDR40,"Larado was an exceptionable Western TV series that unlike most of its contemporaries had a comedic quality with its lead character played by Neville Brand. Brand portrayed his charactor ""Reese Bennett"" with both  serious and comedic qualities. He would always get in trouble and his fellow Texas Rangers played by Peter Brown, William Smith, Phillip Cary & Robert Wolders would have to rescue him or help him out. With his supporting cast and great guest stars each week the show was top calibre.  It's strange for me to be writing this as when I was a college student back in the mid-60's I had the pleasure of visiting the set of ""Larado"" at Universal Studios.  It was wonderful experience which would be hard to duplicate today.
Larado should, in my opinion, have lasted longer than the just the 2 Seasons they did.  It was one of a kind.",1236038400,13,841,4.662162162162162
