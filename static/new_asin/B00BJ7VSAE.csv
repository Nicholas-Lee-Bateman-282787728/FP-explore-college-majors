5634895,5,B00BJ7VSAE,"I came across Anne's youtube videos for Spirit Voyage. After I watched several, I found myself wishing she had a DVD. Then I came across this one on her website and was quite delighted that I could order from Amazon!.

I love how well she conveys her knowledge. She is very encouraging and supportive. This video has a very good introduction. I also like how the warm up, deep mediation, and main yoga sections are separate so it is easy to put together a routine to fit your needs. Her voice is very soothing. A very good introductory DVD to Kundalini Yoga. Must buy. Good to have in your toolbox.",1388275200,8,598,4.4363636363636365
5634896,4,B00BJ7VSAE,"I've been doing kundalini yoga dvd's for a few months now, mostly with Raviana's dvd's and Gurmukh's.

There are a lot of things to like about this dvd. The set is beautiful and the music relaxing. You get an opening segment with the typical Adi Shakti mantra.

From there, you go on to have a choice of two different warm-up sets and then 3 kriyas. You have a gong meditation which is a nice bonus but definitely not the same as hearing it live. There's a lovely musical kirtan sequence as well with Gurunam Singh. One issue with the dvd is the fact that there's no way to design your own workout, you're always having to go back to the menu and make another selection once the segment you're working on is done. Also you should be warned that all of the kriyas contain very lengthy meditations in addition to poses so if you're buying this strictly for ""exercise"" you might be disappointed. I'm more or less a newbie and I did find a few of the poses to be very challenging, however modifications are suggested for the beginner.",1376524800,21,1030,4.444444444444445
5634897,5,B00BJ7VSAE,"These DVD classes are great for a beginner like me - and the mix and match sets are helpful in keeping me engaged. Anne is a positive teacher who seems very passionate and has fun at the same time. It's also nice that she says ""please"" when giving instructions!

During the workout I got dizzy a couple times, but took care of that by incorporating her recommended adjustments to better match my skill level. The poses are seemingly simple but very challenging when incorporating breath and movement. Her relaxed and accepting approach encouraged me to push myself.

Her outfits are pleasing and her voice is soothing. The sound production in the narration in a couple parts is awkward, but is fine overall. The soundtrack is fantastic - not overpowering, not cheesy, just the perfect addition to help you along. I especially liked that the whole DVD ended with an Irish blessing.",1376265600,7,880,4.821192052980132
5634898,5,B00BJ7VSAE,"This practice is life-changing for many people, and Anne has such a wonderful presence.  She is truly a shining star by helping her students become brighter, bolder, and more radiant in their practice and life.  The only thing better than this DVD is sitting in her live class!  For anyone not fortunate enough to be able to take her classes, this is a great way to understand the practice towards a healthier mind, spirit, and being from anywhere in the world.",1370822400,4,461,4.666666666666667
5634899,5,B00BJ7VSAE,"5 stars! I love it! How could I not??! Anne does a magnificent job communicating the beautiful technology of Kundalini Yoga by Yogi Bhajan. Her instruction and execution of the poses is impeccable, the music synched beautifully with the kriyas and meditations, and her own radiance and authenticity shines through and through! Thank you Anne for bringing the gift of this DVD into the world! Wahe Guru! .... Can't wait for the next one!",1363305600,11,436,4.905405405405405

8569396,5,B00BJ7VSAE,Beautiful presentation of her skills as a yoga teacher!,1439164800,,55,5.222222222222222
8569397,4,B00BJ7VSAE,"This DVD has a nice variety of warm-ups, kriyas and meditations, all clearly explained and well-demonstrated. Anne Novak comes across as gentle, strong and calm, and very devoted to her practice and teaching.
The main menu offers the following (note: ldb = long, deep breathing. bof = breath of fire).
Warm-up 1 (15 mins). 4 stroke-breath. Arch spine back and forth while sitting cross-legged, holding shins (sometimes called camel-ride). Cat-cow. Seated forward-bend held with ldb.
Warm-up 2 (14 mins). 4 sets of sun salutations, performed at a moderate pace.
Foundation for Infinity Kriya (approx. 30 mins.) Sit cross-legged, hands clasped behind neck, twist torso side to side. Sit cross-legged, hands clasped behind back, arms raised, touch forehead to floor repeatedly. Back push-ups, sit with legs out, lean back on hands and raise hips and body into a tilted straight line. Stand for 26 crow squats. Standing backbend to forward-fold 26 times. Standing side-bends 26 times to each side. Stand and kick alternate legs while chanting `har'. Meditation to Experience Your Boundlessness (11 mins), chant `Har, har, mukunday', pulling in the navel, and directing your attention up through the top of the head towards infinity.
Subtle Body Kriya for Refinement (26 mins). Sit cross-legged, move the heart in circles (also known as stomach-grinds). Ldb as you hold your arms out from the body, elbows bent at a 90 angle palms held out flat. Cat-cow. Step back into a lunge while raising arms and back to standing, repeated several times. Sit with legs out straigh, lean back on elbows, forearms raised, hands in fists. Easier version, stay like this with bof. More advanced, raise hips, keeping body in a tilted straight line, bof. Standing forward-fold, hands under soles of feet if possible, ldb. Bow pose with bof. V-pose (known as boat pose in Hatha yoga) with bof. Sit in lotus or just cross-legged, palms on floor, raise feet and hips off the floor, ldb. Stretch pose with bof. Meditation to Clarify the Subtle Body (11 mins) repeatedly raise arms to form a circle around your head then lower them while breathing through o-shaped mouth.
Kriya for Emotional and Mental Balance (14 mins). Miracle bend, standing back bend held for about 2 mins, ldb followed by forward fold, pumping the navel with the breath held in and then out.  Stand with legs wide apart and circle hips. Stand with legs wide apart, windmilling arms as you bend backwards then forwards. Meditation: Kirtan kriya (11 mins). Chant `sa ta na ma' with finger to thumb presses. First aloud, then in a whisper, then mentally, then a whisper again and finally aloud again.
Deep Relaxation with the Gong. Anne speaks just a few sentences, directing you to release tension from your body and then the gong takes over with layers of brash, richly-vibrating sound washing over you. I've never experienced a live gong-bath but it must be amazing because even the recorded sound had a distinctly relaxing effect on me.
Finally, two musicians join Anne for a selection of mantras and songs.
This DVD doesn't have the fun-factor of Ravi and Ana nor the dreamy beauty of some of Maya Fiennes DVDs. But Anne has a very appealing presence and her teaching has great sincerity and clarity. She gives more alignment and modification tips than is the norm on other kundalini dvds. I like her forgiving attitude during some of the longer sets of repetitions; she tells us to give ourselves permission to rest if we need to. Her instruction is not mirrored.
The music is very simple, sometimes just a drum-beat, sometimes harp sounds, sometimes both. I found the drum-beat on its own a bit unappealing and it makes it hard to establish your own rhythm. On the other hand, I think the simplicity of the music allowed me to focus better overall; sometimes more elaborate musical arrangements can be distracting. Finally, it's worth noting that the meditations aren't chaptered; they're inseparable from their preceding kriya and the only way to get to them on their own would be to fast-forward through.
There's a lot of well-presented, heartfelt, thorough yoga on this disc and I think it'll prove a solid addition to my kundalini dvd library.",1418428800,14,4195,4.975783475783476
8569398,5,B00BJ7VSAE,Brilliant!!! I would recommend to anyone learning or wanting to do Kundalini yoga!,1410998400,,82,5.384615384615385
8569399,5,B00BJ7VSAE,"I am new to Yoga and find this DVD to be a great learning tool.  The introduction section explains all of the background, terminology, and concepts that you need to know to get the most out of the video.  I've also found Anne Novak's website useful.  She has many links to Youtube videos that she has put up that go over how to perform common postures, including tips and modifications for beginners.",1410480000,,400,4.527777777777778
8569400,3,B00BJ7VSAE,It must not be compatible with MAC computers because I can't watch it.  I don't have a DVD player either.  SO SAD.  I gave 3 stars because I fell in love with Anne Novak on YouTube.,1400803200,,181,3.9722222222222223
