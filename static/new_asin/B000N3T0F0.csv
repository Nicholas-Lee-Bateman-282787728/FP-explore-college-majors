8174637,5,B000N3T0F0,"As I was watching Bend of the River (1952), the western directed by Anthony Mann, I suddenly had a profound sense of deja vu: I could predict what was going to happen. It wasn't just a case of a predictable, redundant plot line  no, the story was quite unusual and quite original. But I felt I knew this story; almost as though I had seen it before. But I knew I never had (I keep meticulous records of movies I have seen). What was it?

The mystery was partially resolved when I suddenly remembered the two-part 1966 episode of the 1964-1970 TV series, Daniel Boone, ""The High Cumberland"" (released theatrically abroad as Daniel Boone, Frontier Trail Rider). Here is an outline of the plots of both movies: the hero (Jimmy Stewart in Bend of the River; Fess Parker in Daniel Boone) is leading a wagon train of settlers to a new land, across the mountains; he rescues a man who is about to be hanged/killed and the man  a rougish character  joins the hero on the trail. The rogue meets the pretty woman in the wagon train who has a playful love/hate relationship with the hero and is obviously attracted to her. The wagon train is attacked by Indians and the woman is injured. The wagon train reaches a settlement where they buy supplies for the winter, which the storekeeper promises to send on in a month. The wagon train leaves; the woman stays behind to recover; the rogue stays behind, too.

A month or more goes by, and the settlers have reached their spot and settled in, but no supplies have arrived. The hero goes back with a friend to inquire. They find that their supplies are still there but have been sold to someone else for a higher price. The hero also finds the rogue is engaged to the pretty woman. The hero takes his supplies by force, aided by the rogue.

A chase follows. They get away (killing the trader in the process). On their journey back, they encounter other settlers who offer to buy their supplies for double the price. The hero turns them down. Along the way, one of the wagons breaks a wheel. While changing it, the men running the wagons  who had been hired in town  let the wagon drop on the hero's friend, injuring him. The hero punches them out, and is backed up by the rogue. The next day, however, the rogue backs up the men when they grab the hero and start beating him. The rogue stops them from killing the hero. The hero says that was a mistake and that he'll get even. In the wagon, the friend and the beautiful woman have an exchange about what one man can do to salvage the situation, on foot and unarmed. The hero eventually wins out, beating the odds  and killing the rogue in the process. He also wins the hand of the pretty woman.

Coincidence? Perhaps. The screenwriters are different. Still, its curious. Especially when you consider that the producer of both the movie and the TV show was Aaron Rosenberg.",1399852800,,2858,4.468330134357005
8174638,5,B000N3T0F0,"If you are considering buying Daniel Boone the TV series, but aren't sure about a full season, buy this DVD and view it.  Then you'll be eagerly purchasing as many seasons of the series as you can find, and carefully making sure you have other separate DVD's of Daniel Boone if they aren't already included in all the season TV series sets you buy.  In fact, this DVD might make you consider just about anything Fess Parker starred in.  Daniel Boone was his best fit, and I'm hooked.  Growing up I missed most of these because I was told chores and homework came first.  Now that I'm older, I am happy to see these on DVD's and look forward to many more whenever I can afford the rest of the seasons.  If you like history, don't be a stuffed shirt prig, just enjoy these for the wilderness lifestyle portrayed, and if you like westerns, you'll love the Daniel Boone TV series.  This ""High Cumberland"" 2-part set was probably the pilot for Daniel Boone and tells how Daniel Boone met Becky.  Purists will argue that you can read accurate history about Daniel Boone and discover he never wore a coon skin hat because he hated raccoons.  It's just a TV show people.  Like one time I commented when I was visiting my parents after I graduated high school and they were watching ""Six Million Dollar Man"" that it didn't look like Lee Majors was really running 40 mph when he yanked the door off of a taxi cab driving down the street.  My mother made the comment, ""He never does, it's just a TV show.""  However, I still believe Lynda Carter was the most convincing Wonder Woman.  Daniel Boone has been portrayed by other actors, but nobody gets it as right as Fess Parker.",1311033600,3,1665,4.455445544554456
8174639,4,B000N3T0F0,"I always enjoy watching Daniel Boone. One thing I noticed about this movie is that it is a remake of the 1952 movie ""Bend Of The River"" starring Jimmy Stewart. Fess Parker is leading a wagon train to Kentucky and Jimmy Stewart is leading one to Oregon.",1207267200,,252,4.382978723404255
8174640,5,B000N3T0F0,"These series are a breath of fresh air. Thanks for bringing forth such wholesome entertainment.
These movies are great! The morality and scruples that these shows teach is hard to find in todays Entertainment world of Sex, Drugs and anti Christian agenda of todays Hollywood.
Thanks again, and keep shows like these coming. I will buy them all.

8174641,5,B000N3T0F0,The release of the Daniel Boone T.V. shows have made me so happy.  I am looking forward to getting every single season.  I grew up watching Daniel Boone on T.V.  I think it is good holsom family shows that have a good moral meaning.  This is something that is not found in television shows of today.  I would love to see more of the great shows released.  Thanks a bunch and keep them coming.  Nettie Carpenter,1179273600,4,410,4.315789473684211
