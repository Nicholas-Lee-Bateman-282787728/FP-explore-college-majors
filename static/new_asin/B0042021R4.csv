8413217,2,B0042021R4,"It's a typical 1980s slasher tale.  A group of teens sneak into an arcade after closing hours, to drink and have sex. Unknown to them, a psycho is loose on the premises, and kills them one by one.

This 2007 film adds nothing new to the old 1980s storyline, nor is it especially well done, nor is it an innovative homage (as SCREAM tried to be).

HACK-MAN is a VERY low-budget, shot-on-video, indie horror film, and it shows.  Production values are crude.  The acting, by an obviously amateur cast, is rough.

Even so, the composition is nice; not slip-shod or arbitrarily framed.  I'm guessing the cinematographer has some professional training.

HACK-MAN is okay, provided one is in a forgiving mood.  It's not painful to watch, just not very good.  And the composition is nice.  So I'm giving it 2 stars, rather than 1.

But really, there are LOTS of better slasher films out there.

HACK-MAN was shot in Texas, and I assume that everyone who worked on the film is a Texas native.  (In case anyone cares.)",1301184000,,1008,4.621468926553672

For those of us old enough to remember this is a great nod to the horror of the eighties. The plot is simple enough: a group of teenagers break into a video arcade after closing for an impromptue party and before you know it, people start getting killed. It follows all horror cliches to the letter but I knew what I was getting in for. The quality is prett good for what it is and DvD has some nice extras like a blooper reel and commentary. Whle its far from perfect it is a refreshing change from today's horror norm. I am glad I stumbled on it and I wish more horror directors would make movies like these again!",1285545600,,731,4.118881118881119
8413219,3,B0042021R4,"It's about what you'd expect from the title, yet another teenage horror flick. I didn't expect much but its better than most low budget horror fare, perhaps even having what it takes to be a little cult classic in its own right.

Some of the scenes needed quite a bit of improving. It's got a cast of unknowns (which I find appealing about indie films) and the acting was acceptable for what the movie is. The storyline was so-so with some corny dialogue and a couple of humorous moments, along with a really cheesy motivation. It's somewhat scary but full of cliches, still it is ok entertainment.

There's no nudity or even hints of nudity from the ladies which is a slap in the face to genre fans but to its defense it does have a couple of cool death scenes. The location was good and creepy looking and sure to get attention from gamerboys. It's pretty predicatable and you'll know who the killer is in the get-go but its still a decent watch. Good, but not great. Stricly for hardcore genre fans.",1283990400,,1002,4.469945355191257
