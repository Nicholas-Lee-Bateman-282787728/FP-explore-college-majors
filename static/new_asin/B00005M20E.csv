1623699,5,B00005M20E,"I have recently started to revisit the movies of my childhood, which have remained memorable for me after all these years. This movie more or less completes my journey back in time.

Today of course we are used to huge and spectacular digital extravaganzas with lots of twists and turns and whizzbang special effects and, paradoxically, science fiction itself is no longer the major source of wonder and excitement it once was. As a result, this movie is unlikely to appeal to today's young people who would view it as a quaint, somewhat stilted, relic from the past. But anyone who is willing to suspend some of their skepticism for a short time, and see this film for what it is, would be rewarded with a genuine cinematic treat.

The story is neither novel nor terribly original, in fact it is rather predictable. It is about love, bravery, friendship, hope for the future and the obstacles that we humans place in the way of achieving these. In other words it is the story of all stories we love and remember - only here it is told in a beautiful and sensitive way with exceptional production values and wonderful acting. Perhaps as a naive youngster this movie had a greater impact on me than it can ever have on the world-weary and cynical old man I have become, but I can safely say that if I were seeing this movie for the first time it would still remain a moving, memorable and treasured experience.

The amazing video and sound quality and general production values lavished on this DVD are in a class of their own. To produce an undoubtedly niche product with such loving care and with so many additional features speaks volumes for the dedication of the publisher. This movie is highly recommended and definitely belongs in your film library!",1284595200,16,1755,4.65483870967742

1623701,4,B00005M20E,"My wife had told me of this film she had seen on TV as a little girl in Cuba.  Apparently it was played quite often because many Cubans I spoke to were familiar with it and had fond memories associated with it.  A friend said she had seen it here and was disappointed because it was campier than she had recalled, but she did remember the title and so I was able to find it for my wife.  We watched it together, and sure, it was dated, but she enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed seeing again Mighty Joe Young after thirty years, recognizing its flaws, yet still able to appreciate and recall the experience of seeing it as a child.  The film is frequently dark and grainy and difficult to see.  The villain is stock - an oyster boat captain who forces his worker's beautiful daughter to marry him and wants to capture in the amphibian man the ultimate oyster diver.  The hero, a young man whose scientist father had performed the operation that allowed him to breathe under water, has that wide-eyed innocent yet self-assured look of Terence Hill in My Name is Nobody.  The story is actually familiar to anyone who's ever seen Splash or The Little Mermaid - your typical fish-out-of-water story, but more a drama than a comedy with mild socialist overtones.  Not a great movie, but worth seeing, I think.",1179705600,5,1306,4.457983193277311
1623702,2,B00005M20E,"I saw this movie  long time ago in the movie theater. I know I liked it then. Some thing must have changed. May be it is my age. When I saw the movie in DVD, I was totally disappointed. The DVD quality was very poor. The story was average. I regret buying this movie.

7944585,1,B00005M20E,"No subtitles, and I don't speak Russian.  The description doesn't say, ""Russian Only"", so one would have expected subtitles.  Not being into silent films, nor listening to Slavic languages, this is less a review of the movie itself than it is of the fact that it's listed in such a way as to make people who don't speak the language in the film think they might understand it.  This is not a review of the DVD, which MAY have subtitles (or even n English track, for all I know), but on Amazon Prime Streaming, it's pointless.

Unless, of course, you speak Russian, in which case you might like it.  I found it confusing, and I'm not really sure the language barrier was an issue",1507334400,,678,4.435483870967742
7944586,5,B00005M20E,"I randomly picked this out of Amazon's Prime Recommendations and I totally loved it!
I enjoyed how each of the characters were, in some way, introduced and highlighted, leaving you feeling sympathetic to every character.
I couldn't, quite tell, if it was supposed to be set in a Soviet Block country or if it was supposed to be Central America, either way, those are some wicked sombreros.",1502496000,,389,4.82089552238806

7944588,5,B00005M20E,"The brilliant Prof. Salvator (Nikolai Simonov) has turned his son, Ichtyandr (Vladimir Korenev) into the silver-suited AMPHIBIAN MAN of the title. Now, the Prof. seeks to create an underwater society. One day, Ichtyandr saves the life of a beautiful woman named Gutiere Baltazar (Anastasiya Vertinskaya), and falls madly in love w/ her. This sends him on a quest to find his lost love. Yes, AMPHIBIAN MAN is goofy beyond belief. Yes, it's utterly absurd in every way imaginable. And yet... and yet, there's something magical, almost hypnotic about this Russian romantic farce. From its sombrero-wearing police force, to the Professor's mountain-top laboratory, to the odd flamenco-dancing, this is one preposterous movie. And yet... and yet, I kept watching it as though my eyelids had been stapled to my forehead! I found Ms. Vertinskaya to be absolutely captivating, while Korenev could have been the Russian Johnny Depp! Indeed, AMPHIBIAN MAN must be seen by anyone born of woman! Indeed...",1426377600,4,993,5.291139240506329
7944589,5,B00005M20E,"Great Russian-made tale of a sort-of underwater Tarzan.  A great professor/scientist saves his sickly son's life by operating on him and putting gills in him so he can breathe underwater.  Over the years the son grows up partially under the sea.  The villagers, unaware of the family drama, end up believing there is some sort of undersea devil lurking in the local waters.  The kid falls in love with a beautiful girl promised to the town villain.  The movie is beautifully filmed in color, the picture is great and it captures the feel of a seaside Mexican village.  My only complaint is with the story itself.  It has a semi-sad ending.  I also have an American-cut DVD-R version from Sinister Cinema where it has a happy ending, which I prefer.  Still, the Russian DVD is excellent quality and is worth getting.  Highly recommended.",1395187200,5,836,4.783216783216783

7944591,2,B00005M20E,"This is one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. Granted, it's Russian,  which makes the pearl diving a bit of a mystery. I was never sure where it was supposed to be. I'm still not sure.  But maybe that a good thing.",1351555200,2,225,4.090909090909091
