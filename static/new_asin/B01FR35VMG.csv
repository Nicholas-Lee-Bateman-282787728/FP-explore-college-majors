8761335,4,B01FR35VMG,"(Even Lambs Have Teeth) is a slasher \ revenge film with a slight camp edge. It might seem quite brutal if you have never seen the (I Spit On Your Grave) remake or sequels.

Although in this film they don't actually show the rapes and tortures afflicted upon the two girls but we see that it's happening and it's effects and it gives us enough to root for the girls revenge. They managed to throw in some subtle horror film homages here and there which was cool too.

When it comes to the revenge aspect it's much more graphic and satisfying. All in all it's a pretty good little revenge flick and I enjoyed it, the acting was done in a fun ""we're not taking our selves too serious"" kind of way which was fun!",1490659200,,709,4.2444444444444445
8761336,3,B01FR35VMG,"Two young women are drugged, kidnapped, chained to shipping containers in the wilderness and used as prostitutes before they turn the tables on their tormentors and going on a killing spree in revenge.  The I Spit On Your Grave crowd will likely be disappointed as the sex is suggested and the violence very tame.  If anything, this weirdly feels like early Hal Hartley or Richard Linkletter doing an ironic take on I Spit On Your Grave style revenge thrillers.

Even Lambs Have Teeth has little in the way of visceral thrills that the better revenge thrillers tend to manage.  The film feels very polite and the two girls seem weirdly calm and pleased with themselves as they take out the bad guys one by one, cracking jokes and smiling like the whole thing is just another bonding experience.

On the plus side Tiera Skovbye as the more conservative Katie (at least until the theoretical trauma of forced prostitution loosens her up) and Kirsten Prout as her wilder BFF Sloane are both extremely likable and have great chemistry together-- but Even Lambs Have Teeth isn't really exciting enough to be a thriller, sleazy enough to be an exploitation film or funny enough to be a comedy, so it's hard to figure exactly what it's supposed to be.  It's an agreeable enough film if you aren't expecting much, but beyond the charming lead actresses, there are not really many reasons to sit through this one.  It might make an interesting double feature with a more conventional example of the genre like I Spit On Your Grave; Last House on the Left; or Bound to Vengeance because watched next to one of those films the tonal strangeness of Even Lambs Have Teeth will likely stand out even more.  It's likely the sunniest, breeziest rape revenge thriller ever made--but the question is did the world really need a breezy rape revenge thriller?",1475539200,,1839,4.761006289308176

8761338,5,B01FR35VMG,"This was one of the most fun movies I've watched in a while (well the post escape part).  The start of the movie isn't that great, at first it seems like this is a rather amateur production, and the girls aren't that likable or even seem that bright, especially the shorter haired one Sloane (Kirsten Prout) who tries to peer pressure her best friend Katie (Tiera Skovbye) into doing drugs and other things the more sensible of the duo doesn't morally want to do.  You could deduct the rating half a star or something for the start, but honestly once this gets going it becomes so much fun that you can't not rate it five stars.  There's a lot of vengeance films out there, but none are this enjoyable, this is the type of film where you start to get disappointed when you realise there's only a few people left that haven't got their comeuppance yet.

Basically the plot of this one has two older teen girls taking a working holiday to a farm so they can make and save since obviously there will be nothing to spend their wage on there, for a New York shopping spree afterwards.  Their uncle drives them to a small roadside diner where the farm's bus picks up its workers from.  A couple of cute guys start talking to them and even though Katie knows they shouldn't she gives into Sloane's sense of adventure to let the guys drive them there.  Of course these guys have no intention of taking them to that farm, instead they take them to their own, where they have their own evil plans of making money and enjoying themselves, with the two girls.  Katie and Sloan quickly learn they aren't the first victims, so what happened to the previous girls who aren't chained to a couple of shipping containers in the middle of nowhere like they are now?  Katie and Sloane need to escape, and they can't let go what was done to them or allow it to happen to anyone else!

As I said this is just a fun film once the vengeance factor kicks in.  Sure the vengeance activities aren't the most realistic, and the girls don't seem to care about hiding their identities or anything like this while buying equipment, and they do find unique ways to deal with each tormentor like any good horror film.  Although obviously we know some bad stuff happens to the girls in the shipping container we don't see it and there's no nudity or anything like that either.  So it's appropriate for anyone old enough aloud to watch horror franchises like Scream and teen market aimed horror comedies like this.

This movie also has great songs playing as its soundtrack.  Hope they release an official soundtrack album.",1468454400,,2588,4.511777301927195
