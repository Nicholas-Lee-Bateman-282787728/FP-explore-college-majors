8007035,5,B0001610R0,"This volume of the excellent Figure 17 starts a turning point in Tsubasa Shiina's relationship with her alien ""twin"", Hikaru.  Up to this point, the girls had been forging a close relationship while fighting against the deadly Maguars, but Tsubasa finds enough confidence to strike out on her own and to make friends with one of her male classmates.
This one ends sadly; we lose one character who we barely knew (but who was sympathetic and kind), and the death is almost a footnote to the story.  I wonder how Tsubasa will dig herself out of this one-- will she need Hikaru's help, or even ask for it?",1085184000,,602,4.564814814814815
