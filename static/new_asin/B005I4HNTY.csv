4708160,5,B005I4HNTY,"Ever wish you could actually sit close enough to see your musical heroes in action, live, instead of in the nosebleed seats?  This is the one to get if the music of David Crosby and Graham Nash is as comfortable as your favorite pair of jeans and your flannel shirt and you could just wallow in the stuff.  Audio is superb - you can hear every timbre, the thud of the bass and the wail of the lead guitar, Crosby belting and Nash crooning, drums, steel guitar and those great keyboards.  Camera angles are superb - watch them play!  See the expressions on all the musicians' faces.  Listen to the charming repartee of these two old friends, not mucked up by any distortion on a PA system.  It's not quite the same as being right there at the time, but it's an unforgettable experience to see this concert.  Originally broadcast on HD TV, but worth watching again and again; consider the source!)

I don't ever want to see any part of this superb SEVEN star performance excerpted and put on the Internet unless it's meant to encourage people to buy this DVD.  Blue Castle Records is the new label owned by David Crosby and Graham Nash themselves.  Please support not only them but the marvellous colleagues they introduced on stage and everyone else who made this available!",1318896000,23,1273,4.568281938325991

I wish they would have chosen to release this on the superior Blu-ray format with a lossless audio format. But that being said, this is a wonderful concert by two great songwriters and friends. Their backing band is also very good with Dean Parks, James Raymond, Kevin McCormick and Steve Distanisloa. If you are a music lover, you will not be disappointed with this release. Come On Graham, Have the Stills box set and the CSNY 74 live release ready by the end of 2012!",1318291200,40,1151,4.655172413793103
4708162,5,B005I4HNTY,My husband and I were in the 3rd row for the filming of this concert and I have to say that Crosby and Nash put on an amazing show! Crosby and Nash are such good friends and it is evident in the respect and kindness that they show for each other on stage. Being in their presence is like being among old friends. I highly recomend purchasing this DVD if you are a C&N fan! We will be sure to get our copy as soon as it is released.,1318118400,15,431,3.853932584269663

4708166,5,B005I4HNTY,"I love this set list.  I have virutally all of the CSN-related DVDs and CDs.  This is definitely one of my favorite disks to pop in and relax.  David's voice is still amazing.

BTW, this is the disk that David is selling at his live shows right now.  If you have a chance to go see his solo act, do not hesitate.  I think he is better without having to fight Stephen and Graham for stage leadership.  What a great show....",1398729600,,422,4.135802469135802
4708167,5,B005I4HNTY,"I can't say anything but they're much energetic for their age :)
But Mr. Crosby would rather not too loud pitching the high note....",1381276800,,132,4.541666666666667

4708169,5,B005I4HNTY,"I have been waiting about 40 years to watch Graham Nash perform ""I used to be a king"". What a marvelous version on this DVD. The DVD is worth $20 to know the answer to...what language is the sign in saying ""don't dig here"" over Yucca mountain (nuclear disposal site). David Crosby's son co wrote the song and played keyboards for the concert. They hire session guitarist Dean Parks (Steely Dan and many other hit groups guitarist), Jackson Browne Bassist Kevin McCormick and Stevie D for drums. I have a half dozen DVDs of CSNY and in them Young falls asleep a couple times, Stills forgets the words on one and some are just not that pretty at all (Zevon quote). This is just darn near perfect. A few high notes could have been better but compared to most grey haired rock stars of my era they still really have it. Marrakesh Express was different but amazing, the horseplay between Nash and Crosby made it seem like you were right there with them. It was 2 1/2 hours of pure magic. Note a small part of the concert (1 hour) was on HD net but it basically cut the heart out of it. Cathedral has been one of my favorite CSNY songs and this version was as good as I have ever heard. The guitar solos on Wooden Ships, 8 miles high, I almost cut my hair, were also noteworthy. Only 1 bad song and it was a 1 minute political joke aimed at billion dollar corporations who paid no taxes (subliminal man...cough ""GE, etc""). It was truly a pleasure to the ears...shu",1371081600,,1458,4.344322344322344
4708170,1,B005I4HNTY,This DVD is a poor quality copy of Sherlock Crow's concert in Detroit-- this present DVD has nothing new and is of much poorer quality-- like watching an old VHS copy of the Gobe Sessions!!  Save your money and buy the original!!!,1357948800,,230,4.476190476190476
4708171,4,B005I4HNTY,"I have been a fan of CSN, CSNY plus David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young solo since the late '60s/early '70s.

I especially liked the records Crosby and Nash did together - Graham Nash/David Crosby (1972), Wind On the Water (1975) and Whistling Down the Wire (1976) - and wrongly assumed that that would be the catalog of songs they toured with and recorded for this live DVD set.

Where are Southbound Train, Page 43, The Wall Song, Immigration Man, Carry Me, Mama Lion, Take the Money and Run, Time After Time, Foolish Man, Broken Bird, to name but a few from each record?

The set list is peppered with CSN/Y tunes and strong cuts from each of Crosby and Nash's impressive solo records, but some of that is available on the CSN 2012 DVD.

This DVD has fine visuals and a very good live audio recording from Aura Sonic Mobile. Dean Parks is simply incredible on guitar, and brings a really good rock feel to the set. There's some politics in the between-song banter, and there is some new material you may or may not enjoy, depending on what you are looking for in a Crosby-Nash concert.

I for one was hoping for more Crosby-Nash material and should have paid more attention to the set list before I bought this.",1357862400,2,1235,4.495535714285714

4708173,5,B005I4HNTY,"I saw parts of this show on tv and had to get the dvd. Tight band including
Dean Parks who played guitar with Steely Dan. He blends his talents nicely
with Crosby and Nash who sound as good as ever. Great song list with some
nice surprises like Wind on the Water,the Byrds Eight Miles High and
Simple Man. Some Hollies tunes would be nice. How about a Hollies Reunion?
That would be nice. This dvd was well worth the price and gets repeated plays.",1352160000,,447,4.270588235294118
4708174,5,B005I4HNTY,"I have followed these guys since their days with the Hollies and the Byrds, and I've always loved their music. I've seen them play separately and together and with CSN/Y. I even saw Graham play solo at the Fillmore about five years ago. I can say, as a totally experienced fan, that this concert dvd is amazing! The band is tight from the guitarist to keyboards to bass and drums. A beautiful sound, both polished and free-spirited! This disc is a must for any C/N fans, and has just about all of their top material, with the exception of Graham's beautiful ""Sleep Song"". Roll a fattie and get ready for two and a half hours of jazzy, cool bliss! And for those that don't like the politics, too bad! If you follow the boys for long, then you know that they're going to speak up about what's going on around us. This music has a lot of heart!",1346976000,2,841,4.329113924050633
4708175,5,B005I4HNTY,"If you are a fan of David Crosby and Graham Nash this is a must have.  Their voices are in peak form.  The acoustics in the concert venue are great and they both obviously enjoy themselves.  I got a real kick out of watch Graham when he was not singing.  He would back way off the mike and still sing along.  He always appears to be intensely caught up in the music.  If I could give this 6 stars, I would.",1345852800,,406,3.950617283950617
4708176,5,B005I4HNTY,I have always been a fan of Crosby and Nash so I would imagine my review may sound one sided. That said these guys can still sing beautiful harmonies together unlike some people their age. I wasn't able to see them in 2011 so I was glad that this dvd came out. May Crosby and Nash keep on going!,1344643200,,295,4.016949152542373
4708177,5,B005I4HNTY,"While I just heard this for the first time (a bit late for 2011 top 10 lists!) it is REALLY GOOD, & I would personally give it a tie for best album of 2011 along with Juliana Hatfield's There's Always Another Girl.

This is pretty much as good as their peak years; unlike Stills DC & GN really haven't lost much in old age.

My only complaints are:
1. No cd release
2. The only audio option is lossy Dolby.

Superb show, Buy it.",1342656000,,428,4.071428571428571
4708178,5,B005I4HNTY,"I can recommend this DVd without even seeing it because a DVD of Crospy & Nash in 2011 is the next best thing to attending one of their concerts. My son and I saw them in Vicar Street, Dublin, just a month ago and they delivered a performance of absolute perfection - and nearly three hours long. Friendly and entertaining, Crosby & Nash enjoy what they do and respect their audience by giving real value for money. And I've no doubt that this DVD will reflect that.",1342051200,,466,4.367816091954023
4708179,4,B005I4HNTY,Loved this DVD. Crosby and Nash at their best. They need to let the political references drop however. Their harmonies are still superb.,1335916800,,136,4.956521739130435
4708180,5,B005I4HNTY,Fantastic compilation of songs by two singers who harmonize beautifully and add a smile to any day.  Enjoy this DVD as background music or to sit and watch.,1335571200,,156,4.571428571428571
4708181,5,B005I4HNTY,"I bought this DVD because I am a huge fan of C,S,N & Y. However I am more of a S & Y fan and always thought of C & N as the weak links in this group. So I bought this DVD with very low expectations and DAMN was I impressed!!! C&N played some songs from the past that happen to be some of my favorites and they had a 5-Star back-up band. David Crosby and Graham Nash are true professionals, and so are their vocals. Hey buy this DVD you won't regret it one bit!!!",1331424000,,462,3.7731958762886597
4708182,5,B005I4HNTY,"Sit back, relax and enjoy this DVD. Truly 2 of the best singer/songwriters of our generation. Their voices to this day are still a magical blend of perfect harmony. Truly a 5 star performance.",1331164800,,192,4.676470588235294
4708183,3,B005I4HNTY,"The performances are incredible. The picture and audio quality are abysmal, when compared to the quality of the performances.  This was broadcast (live even, I believe) on HDNet.  I've seen and heard higher quality on YouTube.",1329177600,2,226,5.25
4708184,5,B005I4HNTY,"The video is fabulous!  They just get better with age.  Their voices/harmonies brought us back to our 1970's childhood.  We saw them in concert with Steven Stills a few years back, and this was just as good.",1326412800,,207,4.54054054054054
4708185,5,B005I4HNTY,"Amazing concert. Being one of my all time favourite bands with or without some of the letters of the alphabet ... CSNY ,CSN or just C&N ! What is wonderful  is how they rearrange the songs to suit the reality that they have been around for about 40 odd years now. The magic still remains!",1325203200,,288,4.236363636363636
4708186,5,B005I4HNTY,"As a long time fan of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young it is good to see all of them continuing to perform solo and in group combinations. The video and sound quality of this DVD is excellent. I could not have picked a better set list.  The concert opens with a great version of 8 Miles High and the band rocks on Military Madness.  Nash is superlative on Cathdral and Crosby resonates on Almost cut My Hair. The band is fantastic and it is amazing how well both Nash and Crosby continue to sing.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1324166400,,525,4.282828282828283
4708187,1,B005I4HNTY,"Firstly, the concert is fantastic and the production of video and sound is top-notch.

The reason I give it one star is because I really expected A LOT more from the picture quality.

I mean how can a network called ""HDnet"" (and I stress the ""HD"" here) put out a 480p video?  I am so disappointed with the pixelated picture that it ruins my enjoyment of what would otherwise be a phenomenal concert DVD.

I mean, do I have to rip it from my DVR to get better picture quality?  I WANT to support more of this kind of thing, I am willing to spend my money on it - give it to me the best it can be and I'll keep coming back for more.  It's a $20 DVD and they sure didn't break the bank on the packaging.

But I don't care about packaging - I want to get immersed in the concert!  Not be distracted by pixelated, video-game quality renditions of these two legends...

C'mon HDnet - for the love of Gus, release it in HD!",1323820800,9,916,4.072625698324022
4708188,4,B005I4HNTY,"I must say that I was surprised how good this concert dvd is. I have always been a fan of CSNY,CN,S,Y,SY and all of their different groupings. This band is very good,and although their voices are not like they are still 30, it is good. I think better than the CSN accoustic dvd of about 10 years ago. Worth having I waited a long time for this pairing on their own",1323734400,,364,4.140845070422535
4708189,5,B005I4HNTY,"My husband and I also attended this concert and had excellent seats as well.  I can't say enough about the wonderful acoustics in this theatre, but most of all, these two living legends put on a show that was outstanding.  I am so thrilled to be able to buy this DVD.  If you are a fan, this is a must have.  Enjoy!",1322524800,,315,4.032258064516129
4708190,5,B005I4HNTY,"I never did an amazon review...I like a low-profile...'swing low, sweet chariot' thru the 21st century.  However, this show hit a huge audio nerve.  I count it all for my son, yes, on May 22, 2011 he called me, and left a message...""Have you ever heard of Crosby, Stills & Nash?...Dad, they are performing tonight in Stamford..."" And where am I?  ...in Stamford, Connecticut...it's 6:45 p.m. I call my son back...yeah, he's not interested in going, nor his friend, but he heard they are performing at the Palace, his friend's parents are going...great...it's making me feel real old...so old.  I call the Palace, no, it's not Crosby, Stills & Nash...Crosby & Nash are performing, and yes, they have seats available in the balcony...way in the back...and I know the Palace...the seats way in the back of the theatre has the best acoustics, it's an awesome venue...I get in my roadster and sped to the Palace, I get at the box office exactly at 7:29 p.m, I hear David and Graham kick it off exactly at 7:30 p.m. I plunk down my visa, it's denied...I plunk my musician union credit card...it goes thru...who would have thought? (so I got my ticket way in the back in the balcony where you get nose bleeds)...and oh, David and Graham were so awesome...tight band, good vibes...Graham and David performed for nearly three hours with a 15 minute break in between.  And to step back in time...I saw and heard David and Graham at their very first performance ever...together at the University of Detroit, Detroit, Michigan in the year of 1971...forty years ago. It was a long time ago.  Howlin Wolf opened for them.  The concert was a benefit for a voting drive, yes, David Crosby & Graham Nash perform their very first concert for a benefit drive to register young voters, and they performed at the University of Detroit...go figure...and they had Howlin Wolf open for them!  As I recalled, all David and Graham had were two Acoustic Martins, and a black baby grand piano...and they both missed Stephen, ah, they would remark between songs, oh, they can't play that guitar part nor that guitar break...and how they miss Stephen, and oh, David and Graham were awesome together...so was Howlin Wolf who opened for them...and together again, David and Graham were awesome on May 22, 2011...amazing...it's something spiritual.  1971 to 2011...forty years...buy the video...you won't regret it.",1322265600,9,2382,4.890818858560794
4708191,4,B005I4HNTY,"The last known CROSBY-NASH VIDEO..is the BBC IN CONCERT show from 1970 and that is not ""officially"" availble on DVD (it is all over you tube minus one song (Right Between The Eyes). So it has taken over 40 years for an offical long form  CROSBY-NASH concert. The set list is varied from old to new and contains some very nice song choices. Sure, a few more older or rarer Crosby rarities such as ""Somehow She Knew""  or""Triad"" (I can WISH)would have enhanced the set list greatly but what they DO perform still has crisp and beatiful harmony. Yes, Crosby's voice is in a lower range and Nash has to compensate but overall this is a very entertaining and fortunately COMPLETE show of this Satellite broadcast concert (Not a very easy broadcast to find on the net -I tried to watch it..and was shut out.) One negative...the BONUS footage is scarce and for some reason they do not include the rare (and only aired twice on Showtime) promo of Graham Nash performing ""Live On"" (the Wall) a very nice live performance video that has never surfaced on youtube or on this or any other DVD.",1319760000,2,1080,4.533333333333333

After seeing them so many times in the last decade there are really no surprises here for me: great sound, songs and chemistry.  Special mention must be made of David's supremely talented son, James Raymond on keyboards and vocals.  Check out the 2005 Crosby-Nash studio double cd set.

I looked for it here at Amazon and was so glad it was available to buy. I wasted no time in ordering it. I have never seen these guys or CSN - CSN&Y in concert. God knows I'd like too before they stop touring. The high cost of tickets is what stops me. Okay back to this review. The duo has a kick ass band that makes this a must have in your collection. They share many of their best songs that makes this enchanted evening a great viewing pleasure. I hope one day they will release this in a cd format...
