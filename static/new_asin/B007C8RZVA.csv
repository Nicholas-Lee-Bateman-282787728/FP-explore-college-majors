5077087,1,B007C8RZVA,"While I did not purchase this Blu Ray here on Amazon I did purchase it today at Target for $7.50. I must say this was the biggest let down ever. The images on the front and back of the case invoke a feeling of warmth, and excitement ; the same one would expect and surely would end up finding in the Life documentary as well as the Planet Earth documentaries. This documentary on the other hand made me feel like I was back in 7th grade classes taking lecture notes. The narration completely lacks enthusiasm and seems to drag on and on forever with boring facts.

Now I have never written a review in my life, for amazon, nor any site. Nor have I ever filled a survey out. The only reason I am writing this review is to let others know that it is just THAT bad. I wouldn't have paid .25 cents for it. Save your money!",1355702400,4,818,4.144654088050315

5077089,1,B007C8RZVA,"It's basically a visual tour of the architecture and some of the art of several cities in each country, dropping a lot of names without connecting them sufficiently to either history or the architecture and art. The videos are tedious.",1345766400,2,235,4.9
5077090,1,B007C8RZVA,"I wish I could give this -1 Star.  This is one of most boring travel videos I have ever seen.  I've heard good things about Spain from family, friends and co-workers but this video does NO justice to Spain and Portugal.

-If you're expecting anything like Rudy Maxa or Rick Steves, forget it.
-This is NOT HD.  Looks like a converted VHS to DVD and then to Blu Ray...bad quality!!!
-The host is soooooo Boring!
-Mainly about architecture...nothing else.
-Waste of time.  I could of slept those wasted time!

Thank goodness I didn't pay $15-20 for this junk!",1341792000,5,557,4.63265306122449
5077091,4,B007C8RZVA,"The 411 by Maria:

I was very interested in viewing this as my husband's family if from Vigo Spain and go there 6 months of the year. Not a bad life huh? Well, I have yet to be there even though there would be a beautiful place to stay with people who know exactly where to go and what to do. We are not in a position to plan a vacation any time soon. I LOVED this video. Hearing how beautiful it is from my family isn't the same as seeing a well produced movie of the area.
Gorgeous! I can completely see why they long to go back every 6 months. They come here for the grand-kids but Spain is there home. Truly a beautiful place to live and after seeing this I want to visit and see the history I have heard them speak of for the past 20 years of my life. Portugal is the second destination featured. With stunning landscapes and amazing food! If you love visually stunning journeys which you can take right from your living room. This is the DVD for you.",1335744000,4,956,4.085106382978723
5077092,2,B007C8RZVA,"When you see the words ""Beautiful Planet"" - they evoke images that we've stored in our memory of the beauty reflected in the unique topography of the planet we all inhabit - and that we call planet earth. Whether it's a beautiful photo rendered in a magazine, or a high definition 1080p television picture from a documentary series like the BBC's<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray</a>], the images touch us in a unique way, and stir our emotions. The only emotions that ""Beautiful Planet - Spain & Portugal"" Blu-ray stirred within me - made me want to turn it off. I was indifferent and bored.

Perhaps those of us who have seen a David Attenborough narrated BBC documentary have been spoiled (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-David-Attenborough-Narrated-Version-Blu-ray/dp/B002UXRGM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life (David Attenborough-Narrated Version) [Blu-ray</a>]). The production values that we appreciate in the Beeb's HD blu-ray offerings are completely absent here. While the camera work is a little more interesting and varied compared to ""Blue Planet - France & Italy,"" the films failed to capture the stunning views and vistas that any visitor to either country knows, is waiting just around the corner.

The Spanish film smartly starts in Barcelona, but fails to reflect the vibrant and beautiful nature of the people, the food, and the incredibly unique architecture found throughout the city. The Portugal film starts in the northern city of Guimares, which is historically important in the country's history. Because of the below par production values, and very average images, you will find yourself wondering why anyone would want to visit such a sleepy place. (If you get a chance to visit Guimares go! You will find a gorgeous small European town!).

Whoever wrote the narrative to these films, and whoever hired the voice talent, should be fired. Even if the images aren't the greatest, the narrative has the potential to improve the viewing. The producer chose non-native english speakers who speak in a monotone, and don't know how to pronounce many of the words in the script. About 28 minutes into the Portugal script you'll hear the narrator say ""harbinger"" and she says it like it rhymes with zinger. The script of each film (just like the France and Italy films) are overly obsessed with door jambs, and trivial details, that will not make you want to visit these two beautiful countries, and that's a shame.

Save your money for a real trip to Spain and Portugal, as that will be far more enriching than these boring and visually unexciting travelogues. Spain and Portugal are beautiful countries, with lots to offer any visitor. The only thing that's beautiful about these two Blu-ray films, is the fact that you can switch them off to preserve the beautiful memories preserved in your mind.",1334275200,17,3031,5.554112554112554

8514392,2,B007C8RZVA,"With some of the most beautiful towns and cities on the planet as the subject matter, there is no excuse for this lackluster video.  First there is the issue with the narrators.  It sounds like they grabbed some struggling actresses with no experience and paid them minimum wage to do the narrations.  The first narrator on the Spain part of the video has an accent, but it's not a Spanish accent, and when she pronounces Spanish, she does a poor job.  God only knows what her native language is or why they selected her and her monotone, boring voice.  First up on the Spain part of the disc is Barcelona.  For some reason, they selected an overcast, gloomy day for the extensive footage of the city.  It also appears to be winter or very early spring as the trees have no leaves.  Same thing on the Portugal footage--winter time with bare trees.  Couldn't they have filmed in summer?  Overall this video seems amateurish and low-budget.  The background music and accents of the narrators is just so unpolished.  I was disappointed.  Nevertheless, the subject matter is so beautiful that I gave it two stars instead of one.  You can find much better Spain and Portugal videos on YouTube.",1447113600,2,1188,4.676328502415459

8514397,3,B007C8RZVA,"Let's start with Spain. I have been to Spain and speak fluent Spanish. The unnamed woman who did the narration on Spain sounded like a Brit and like most Brits, she totally fractured the language. Any country that  screws up the name of the Jaguar (pronounced Jagwar, not Jagyouare) or Hagwar in Spanish) or does not know that ""l l"" in Spanish = ""y"" in English is hopeless. They even make Jaguar cars there and still can't pronounce the name properly.  Beautiful Planet takes us to Cordoba and Sevilla in the Moorish south of Spain, which is fine, but they miss the most beautiful city in Spain: Grenada. It's like featuring Jersey City instead of New York City. They also ignore Madrid, which has the Prado, one of the great art museums in the world, and Toledo, the ancient capital of Spain. To their credit they do spend some time in Barcelona, with its unique architecture.
Next is Portugal. The narrator of the tour of Portugal was a woman who seemed to be a native of the country who spoke excellent English. Unlike the Spanish tour, there was music in the background, but for some reason they ignored their most popular folk music, the Fado, which  features a woman singing sad songs accompanied by a Spanish and Portugese guitar. I have hundreds of fados on my Itunes, which I convert to MP3s to play on my car stereo. Portugal has a long history, but the cities are not as beautiful as the Spanish cities.",1362787200,2,1414,4.559055118110236
8514398,1,B007C8RZVA,The music that played during the narrator's speech was horrible and distracting. It sounded low budget. The voice of the narrator was boring making this video a chore to even listen let alone watch. The same result for the other ones from this line of Blurays.,1362182400,3,260,4.673913043478261
8514399,1,B007C8RZVA,This travel documentary was badly filmed and badly written. Special ed high school students could have done better. If I was not living overseas and having this stuff forwarded by relatives I would return it.,1355961600,,208,4.9714285714285715
