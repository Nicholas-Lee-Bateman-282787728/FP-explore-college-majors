8261001,4,B001667JKQ,"Folks, this is basically a bootleg of Hoppity toons taped off of WABC Channel 7 TV from New York City.

That said, the contents are pretty good. The three amusing amigos get into some pretty good adventures here. One episode involving an unwanted ghost features a brief but clever cameo of Bullwinkle. An episode that alludes to the 1964 Olympics (including a slightly dated reference to ""Beating the Russians"") features a stupid bird who is in the habit of carrying off those who attempt the pole vault. ""The Jumping Frog"" is a wacky tale of some crooks kidnapping Hoppity to win a frog-jumping contest and replace him with a bogus amphibian. The detective agency and twilight zone spoofs also appeared in the ""600 cartoons"" DVD set.

Hoppity Hooper is largely forgotten today, but truly great cartoons are those enjoyed after their time by those other than nostalgic adults who associate them with fond childhood memories. I never saw Hoppity as a child, but saw it on the ""600 cartoon"" set and was hooked. Hoppity and Fillmore the Bear are sort of second cousins to Bullwinkle & Rocky (by the same producers), but the con-fox Prof. Waldo Wigglesworth is about as amiable and amusing a villian (or perhaps ""rascal"" is more appropriate) as you can find, totally unlike the intentionally repulsive Boris Badenov, whom he is often compared.

With that said, a number of sites have indicated that there is a market for Hoppity, so the folks at Jay Ward need to get with it and put out a LEGIT Hoppity DVD since Dudley, Bullwinkle, and George of the Jungle have had their turns!",1304208000,4,1575,4.761904761904762
8261002,4,B001667JKQ,I was in grade school when this cartoon aired on TV... and since my last name is Hooper... I soon was known as Hoppity Hooper by all my classmates.  While I loathed this moniker.. I have come to 'embrace' it as I have grown older (and wiser?!?!?).  So... I naturally just HAD to buy this DVD.  The quality - given the recording technology available at the time is pretty good (again... this is very relative).  The editing leaves a little to be desired... but it is okay.  If you want to get lost in this classic cartoon nostalgia... then this is a good buy.,1297987200,,558,4.326923076923077
8261003,5,B001667JKQ,"Despite some flaws,I still think the show itself is funny. the show has clever jokes & good timing. I also loved the way way used Dudley Do-Right & Bullwinkle in one of their episodes. What I liked best about this show the most is that there is no slime humor in this cartoon. For those who like old-school comedy with no gross-out humor,this dvd is for you. I give this dvd a 9 out of 10.",1279670400,3,389,4.131578947368421
8261004,3,B001667JKQ,"While most reviews stick with ""I liked it"" or ""I hated it"", the ones that are most useful to me are the ones that describe the contents in detail.  With that in mind, here's the lowdown on what you can expect if you buy this title:

This DVD contains several of the original four-part story arcs, plus the intro from the syndicated ""Uncle Waldo's Cartoon Show"" version and one or two interstitial segments (sponsor ID, toss to commercial, etc.)  This is much longer than Volume 1, but the downside is that it seems like a direct transfer of somebody's home recording off of TV (specifically, WABC-TV channel 7 in New York).  It took me a while to figure out that the short fragments before the ""Uncle Waldo"" intro were simply the ""teases"" to show what would happen later in the show.  The WABC logos (""We'll return after these messages"") were particularly annoying.

Volume One only contains two stories and an unrelated cartoon, see my review of that DVD for details.

Another DVD I would recommend for Hoppity Hooper fans is from Mill Creek Entertainment, entitled ""200 Classic Cartoons"".  It's available at WAL-MART, but don't bother ordering it from their website... if you can find it in a store it should be about five bucks.  The fourth disc is where the Hoppity 'toons are, and there are six four-part story arcs, only one of which is included on either of the EastWest DVDs shown here.

Hope this helps everyone... with any luck, I'll be back to review an OFFICIAL set of the complete run of Hoppity Hooper!  Hey, I can dream....",1237248000,12,1538,4.659259259259259
