8323879,1,B0001GH6WS,"This DVD really isn't what we were looking for. We wanted a DVD we could follow in a real time - like a class.

The instructions are not very clear. The routine is very SLOW and BORING. The whole hour only one of the partners does the exercises and the other one only supports him/her. That was the most upsetting thing. You need to do the whole routine again and switch then.

Maybe it's because this DVD is a basic level, but we definitely won't try if the other levels are better. We followed this DVD just once and won't do again. The only good thing is that the DVD was quite cheap, so we didn't waste much money.",1211760000,10,618,4.184873949579832
