8174261,5,B000N2X1A6,"The Forgotten Champs focuses on the Chicago Black Hawk's 1961 championship. At the time this production was put together, the Blackhawks had yet to win the Stanley Cup since then.

I knew very little of that championship since it was before I was born and would like to know a little bit more about the history of the Blackhawks other than reading about it online. With interviews from select media people and players like Glenn Hall and Ed Litzenberger, they recap the regular season and each playoff game all the way to the Stanley Cup. There are plenty of live clips, including the final minutes of game 6 and additionally, postgame interviews in the locker room. Extra footage includes clips from the 1951 All-Star game and a Half Cenury of the NHL.

Overall, I would recommend this for hockey, history, or Blackhawks fans, especially at it's price of around $7. It's not a flashy but it tells the story and I found it enjoyable enough to have watched it three times. Since championship videos/DVD's weren't put together back then like they are now, I consider this to be my 1961 Black Hawks championship DVD.",1374883200,2,1113,4.731958762886598
8174262,2,B000N2X1A6,I love anything on the blackhawks but was a little disappointed with this dvd. Iwas looking for more old footage of the playoffs and there was a lot of people talking about the team so it came off like reading a book. OK but no great shakes.,1241740800,3,241,4.148936170212766
8174263,5,B000N2X1A6,"This is an excellent documentary about one of the greatest teams in hockey history.  Using what little resources are available pertaining to the original highlights, etc., the creators of this film do a very plausible and stirring job of retelling the great story of this wonderful season, and re-creating the atmosphere of the time of the ""Original Six"".  An absolute must for any Hawks' fan.  Nice bonus features, too.
Now it's time for these same producers to do a film/DVD on the rest of the glory days of the Blackhawks, from '62 through the mid-70's!
Highly recommended.",1196294400,6,576,4.917525773195877
