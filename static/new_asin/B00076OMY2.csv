2201068,3,B00076OMY2,"The DVD cover is the only non-topless part of the movie. I think you do have to watch almost 3 seconds into the film before a closeup of her breast. There is a plot about some sort of jungle takeover but mostly it concerns this white girl who was lost in the jungle and now is the leader of her tribe and we can be thankful for two things - no one cares she's topless and she resists all efforts to cover her up during several kidnappings and ""tarzan"" like plot points as she escapes back to the jungle. Don't come for the plot, just stay for the nudity. Is it a great film? - no, of course not. But what's wrong with wall to wall jungle girl toplessness plus many other women topless ... not brilliant but solid entertainment for the topless jungle babe genre.",1209945600,4,761,4.219178082191781
2201069,2,B00076OMY2,"This is one of those cannibal movies Franco made in the early 1980s, and if you've seen any of the others, you know what to expect. If you haven't it's your average low budget cannibal movie. Buy this movie if you fall into one of these two categories: A) cannibal movie lovers, or B) Jess Franco completists. It doesn't have much of Franco's trademark directing styles and is not for those who prefer his psychedelic films or his sexploitation movies of the late 60s and early 70s.",1158019200,8,482,4.551724137931035
2201070,4,B00076OMY2,"This is not Jess Franco's greatest work, but it's still entertaining nonetheless. The story is easy to follow and sets itself up very quickly in the beginning of the film.
The English dubbing was done fairly well and was not distracting. The quality of the print was very bad early on in the film, but seemed to improve as it went on. Overall the picture and sound for this Disc are decent quality.
This is only for movie goers that don't analyze every minute detail and just want to watch something in this type of genre. There isn't anything too violent, gory or disturbing in this movie. It's fairly easy to follow and watch. There is a good dose of nudity, which to people familiar with Franco's work, is no surprise. There are also some moments of unintentional laughter which add to this film's charm.
I'm giving it 4 out of 5, but I am a fan of Jess Franco's and have viewed many exploitation and horror films. I'm guessing other reviews will be very much mixed. This should not be your #1 choice if you want to see what Director Franco's work is all about, but still worth at least one viewing experience.",1110672000,48,1113,4.46078431372549

  were a few more admirable characters than what there was,  but still I liked the film and I expect to watch it again.

  I appreciate the fact that the movie was delivered in just a few days.

  Amazon has been very prompt in deliveries.",1425513600,,373,4.338235294117647

8044936,3,B00076OMY2,"Story or a girl who survives a plane crash in the jungle, is revered by the natives as a white goddess, and whose entire wardrobe consists of a loincloth.  She comes across as a bit of a flower child, who just wants to live in love, peace, and harmony with everyone she meets.  Meanwhile back home, a rich relative, ready to make out her will, sends a husband and wife team into the jungle to find the girl, with the understanding that if she can be found and brought back, she will inherit everything; if not, they will inherit.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out what they plan to do if they can get their hands on the girl.  On the expedition, the man spends most of his time getting drunk, while his wife has a torrid affair with one of the guides.  (The guides come across like characters out of one of Edgar Allen Poe's less cheery stories.)  The motive for the guides in coming along on this little jaunt is to get their hands on the diamonds the natives possess.  One of the guides kills a native for no apparent reason, which makes them about as popular with the locals as the Wehrmacht was in Paris.  Also, one of the native girls (also loin clothed) is jealous of the white goddess and is continually trying to discredit her with the rest of  the tribe.  So, as they say, the plot thickens.  Speaking of which, the plot seems rather disjointed, and the dialogue leaves something to be desired.  But then, not too many people are likely to watch this movie for the sparkling dialogue...  All in all, it is about the quality of one of the  Spaghetti Westerns or Kung Fu movies you can find at Wal-Mart in the ""10 movies for $5"" bin.",1408838400,,1646,4.319218241042345

8044938,4,B00076OMY2,"This film isn't as explicit as Franco's DEVIL HUNTER, but you might really like it if you're a fan of that movie. It contains no graphic gore or cannibalism, and there isn't much violence either in this film that has a very low amount of gore; if you're looking for a film with a high body count and gore, I wouldn't recommend it. It's simple and easy to follow. You've got this group searching for this lost girl who has been raised by a tribe in the jungle. There's lots of topless nudity and some full frontal nude scenes; it has some really good looking women in it. People wander around a lot in the jungle, as you look at the films locations. The places where they made the movie are really nice and are filmed well and used to make the movie enjoyable. The movie isn't intense, and the film has nice and peaceful sunny atmosphere throughout. The movie is obviously low-budget with cheap soundtracks, but I personally thought it was one of Franco's best directed films. The film places a big emphasis on scenery and its peaceful and sunny atmosphere to engage the viewer. I really enjoyed the film because I like these jungle films and Franco. It's another one of those films that you can turn off you're brain and just watch because it's a very easy to follow movie. Like DEVIL HUNTER, it'll depend on your taste whether you like it or not.

The DVD quality is excellent.",1394841600,,1378,4.468253968253968
8044939,3,B00076OMY2,"Written and directed by Jess Franco, Diamonds of Kilimandjaro (1983) is an adventure set in the jungles of Africa, that involves the search for a missing girl.  The film features ample female nudity, including a 16 year old Katja Bienert, who is topless throughout the entire film.  Besides the nudity, some accompanying romance, and a few scenic locations, there's not that much to recommend about the movie, which is rather light on action, doesn't have much of a story, isn't particularly well acted or dubbed.

A plane goes down in the jungle, and a white man named Vickers and his goddaughter emerge alive.  Having fallen from the sky, the natives who discover them treat them as gods.  Everyone aboard the plane is presumed dead, until some years later, when some adventurers after precious stones encounter a young white woman who speaks English.

Returning to civilization, the explorers contact the wealthy mother of the girl, who agrees to finance an expedition to try and locate her daughter.  The woman's nephew and his wife join the party, while another expert guide is put in charge of the group.

The expedition reaches their destination, and is attacked by the natives.  Eventually the young girl named Diana (Bienert) saves one of the explorers and takes him as a lover.  She briefly reunites with her relatives, who meet with Vickers.  Living with an exalted status, Vickers has no wish to return to civilization, so the party is sent on their way to meet a dark fate

The ""diamond"" element isn't a major factor, as there isn't much time for prospecting.  The native tribe is led by a woman who aggressively tries to preserve the traditional way of life, providing what little blood and violence there is.  If you are looking for a movie with some serious action scenes, you will be disappointed, as this is merely a light, mildly entertaining adventure, with a healthy dose of nudity.

Image quality of the DVD is decent, but not great.

8044940,3,B00076OMY2,"A French entry by Eurocin, also known as ""Treasure of the White Goddess"", and directed by the Spanish director Jess Franco. Here we have a Tarzan tale, this time starred by an ape-girl instead. A young girl loses her parents on an airplane crush and then she is raised by her ancle who becomes king of an African tribe. Several years later, a group of adventures travels to the place to try contact the girl and bring her back to civilization. However, everyone in the rescue team has his own personal agendas, including that the girl do not return.  Overall, you get a silly plot, a good dose of female nudity, some simulated sex, and essentially no gore. An ok B-movie that will please mostly to Franco fans.

That said, blame should go to Shriek Show for misleading customers. Despite what is declared on the back cover of this release, this is NOT a cannibal movie; there is not a single cannibal scene in this movie. The positive side of the coin is that the movie runs for a bit over 94 minutes instead of the 91 indicated on the technical information, and implying that this is probably an uncut version of the original film(?). The movie comes with an English audio and no subtitles.",1330992000,,1191,4.534883720930233
8044941,4,B00076OMY2,"i haven't seen to many of jes francos films, the ones i have seen usually dissapoint me. i didn't expect much from this film. i was afraid it would be boring and a pain to sit through. i was very surprised to find this film a very fun b movie. the plot involves a group heading into the jungle to find a dying womans daughter who has become the leader of a savage tribe of cannibals. the group intends to get the daughters inheritence (or something) by leaving her in the jungle (or killing her, don't remember) but the groups macho, do well guide doesnt want any part in this scheme. the plot doesnt hold together very well as the characters intensions seem to change every 10 minutes and nothing very exciting ever happens. the film is nothing more than an excuse to get the 3 lead actresses (and the george eastman look alike) naked and thats fine with me. there isn't any gore or graphic violence except for a breif, non gory decapitation. the whole film has a very bizzare atmosphere due to its strange cast and very psychodelic soundtrack. seriously, the music in this film was great, very strange synthesizer that gives the film a 70's feel. the dubbing is hilarious and it doesnt help that the dialouge is horribly bad. again, this adds to the films cheesy appeal. if you like so bad its good cinema with tons of trashy nudity, funky music and horendous dubbing then give diamonds of kilimandjaro a chance. i had fun with it and you will to, 4/5",1223769600,2,1453,4.466165413533835
