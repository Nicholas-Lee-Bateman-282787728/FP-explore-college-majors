This woman's artistry knows no equal and I am only too happy to have her performance of 'Giselle' in my ballet library.  Due to the story line of this historic ballet, she takes you to her own private and spiritual place of creativity.. her place of 'genius'.  I never thought that I would be able to own this performance since it took place so long ago.  It's one of the world's 'treasures' for me.",1173312000,8,514,4.494623655913978
