5695077,4,B00C7CKE8M,"`A Barefoot Dream' is an inspirational film based upon the actual experiences of retired Korean footballer, Kim Shin-Hwan in Timor-Leste (East Timor) portrayed by Park Hee-Soon as Kim Won-Kwang.

Kim Won-Kwang ends up in Timor-Leste in 2003 following yet another of his get rich quick schemes.  However, Timor-Leste only having gained independence in 2002 after years of fighting Indonesia for independence is overwhelmingly poor and suffused with residual tensions.  There is little more than the hopes and dreams of its people.

In his continuing quest for wealth, Kim Won-Kwang is not at all likeable and you really begin to wonder if it is an accurate portrayal of Kim Shin-Hwan.  It isn't until he is accused of taking advantage of the kids' dreams of playing professional soccer for Indonesia, their only way out of the dire poverty, to make money and challenged to a match that he begins to have a change of heart.

With Kim Won-Kwang's eyes set on winning the match, he really begins to coach the kids and eventually inspires both them and the nation to reach for their dreams and beyond.

The dialogue is in Korean, Indonesian and the local dialect of Timor-Leste with English subtitles.  There are also Korean subtitles when the dialogue is not in Korean.",1374364800,3,1265,4.962085308056872

5695104,4,B00C7CKE8M,"I am always a sucker for kids and underdogs. This little movie has both. I may have rated it a bit higher than it deserves.  I went thru a period where all the movies had such poor stories, terrible dialogue, and more than necessary violence. It was very nice to just watch the relationship develop and change the main character's life view.",1406764800,,341,4.5

5695106,4,B00C7CKE8M,"Starts a little slow and you have to get used to a mix of English and subtitles, but if you are a soccer and kid lover, you will love this flick.",1398124800,,145,3.7096774193548385
5695107,5,B00C7CKE8M,"If you're feeling a little flat and uninspired, you should watch this film. It's funny and high-spirited with an underlying solemnity in depicting the turbulent young lives struggling to preserve their innocence in war-torn East Timor. Hie-soon Park steals your heart in his role as the down-trodden, money-driven buffoon who finds his passion and his heart while coaching a hopeless soccer team made up of dirt-poor street kids. Park's sidekick's funny fat guy character is more lovable than most in the category, and the kids are just adorable. You'll love the film, in spite of yourself.",1387584000,4,590,5.15625
8578111,4,B00C7CKE8M,"Great story.  A bit slow in the beginning, but a great development and climax.  You won't believe it's a true story, but it is. Will help kids understand the power of persistence, boldness, empathy, and compassion.  Boys and girls will love it, and adults maybe much more. Funny moments, but have tissues ready. Not five stars because I can't get it with Spanish subtitles.",1496620800,,373,4.796875
