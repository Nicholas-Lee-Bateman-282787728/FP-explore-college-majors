APPARENTLY, THE DIRECTOR BELIEVES FILM NICETIES SUCH AS DIALOGUE, PLOT,  AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT HAVE NO PLACE IN FILM MAKING ANY LONGER.

4520117,5,B0051938XQ,"OK, I just saw THE EXPENDABLES. If you really really liked that movie, don't see this. I actually fell asleep during THE EXPENDABLES because there was too much action, and it just numbed the brain after a while. What was the point of that movie? With VALHALLA RISING, you might be asking yourself that same question, but you won't have a clear cut answer. And different people might have different answers, and they all might be right. So the real point of VALHALLA RISING is that it is thought provoking. The movie itself is a delight for the senses. Awesome cinematography, a haunting score, lush scenery, and terrific acting. Just don't expect non stop mindless action. If you want that, go watch THE EXPENDABLES.",1282521600,15,716,4.782258064516129

4520120,4,B0051938XQ,"A violent, dehumanized, mute, one-eyed warrior finds himself linked to a group of early Christian Vikings who depart to Jerusalem as Crusaders. On their way, something happens, they reach an unfamiliar place vibrant with beauty and dread. The film is, in the end, about salvation and redemption.

With that description, the scenario doesn't quite stand out as breathtaking and the interest of the movie is elsewhere. As starters, picture quality is outstandingly beautiful and several shots come close to modern art painting. Acting is solid, great performance from Mads Mikkelsen in the solitary, brutal, mysterious stranger role. But more than anything else, it is the impeccable rendering of the thick atmosphere of individual isolation and mental degradation, the slow yet deep and inexorable drift of humans towards insanity and violent climax in the face of the unknown, the constant opposition between early Christian beliefs and ancestral, animalistic fears that make this movie a good experience.

For those familiar with this other gem of the movie industry, ""Aguirre, the wrath of God"", Valhalla Rising conveys the same mix of madness, violence and unpredictability. Those interested in fast action might be disappointed as the pace is quite slow. An unsettling but damn enjoyable movie overall.",1281657600,5,1306,5.428571428571429
4520121,3,B0051938XQ,"Valhalla Rising
A visually stunning movie with beautiful cinematography. It shows the ultra violent experiences of a mute, maimed Viking slave.  It's was difficult for me to discern a message or even a point to this film besides appreciating the exceptional visuals.  Perhaps the message was that it was tough to be a Viking slave surrounded by mud, violence and ignorance?  The brief combat scenes were brutal as they were superbly choreographed and left me wishing for more. But this was realistic and mirrors the reality of true medieval combat which was often brief and bloody. The voyage part of the movie on the boat was surprisingly boring and had me itching to hit the FF button of my remote. It is worth seeing for the first class visuals. However, once I had finished watching it I realized why I had not even heard of it until it was out of the movie theaters.",1281312000,3,871,4.642857142857143
4520122,5,B0051938XQ,"If you're expecting a movie with epic battle scenes like 300, watch something more Hollywood. This is a thinking person's film, and don't get me wrong, there are some epic battle scenes, but that's not the focus or the point of this movie. If you look at reviews for this movie, you will find they are either very positive or very negative. That's probably due to false expectations of many people. For a good comparison, think THIN RED LINE vs. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. There's a reason why some of the best actors on the planet worked for virtually nothing on THIN RED LINE. The end result was a masterpiece, but not everyone understood the movie. Instead of directly telling you how you should feel (such Saving Private Ryan did), THIN RED LINE passively brought that emotional response. I suppose some people just need to be told how to feel during a movie and need the movie to hold their hand through every step of the way. These same people, who don't want to think, and who can't open themselves up to the movie will also hate VALHALLA RISING. This is an astonishing movie about humanity. In my humble opinion this is a masterpiece. Despite being visually and acoustically amazing it is an in-depth look into mankind as it is rarely found. If you want a Hollywood action blockbuster, you won't like this movie. Go watch something else. If you have a brain, and want to use it, and appreciate awesome cinematography check this one out. You won't regret it. This is by the way, the best DVD I've seen of this film. It has lots of extras and the director's commentary is fantastic.",1280793600,32,1582,4.593639575971731
4520123,2,B0051938XQ,"Confusing in its vagueness, frustrating in its lack of goals, boring yet pierced briefly from time to time with interesting bits. I did not expect an action epic when watched it. It definitely wasn't. This movie was dreamy, detached, and did not convey well its intentions. It was picturesque, however. I enjoyed the character of One Eye, but his story was empty. Ultimately it was a poor movie that could have been so much better.",1280534400,2,431,4.76

4520127,2,B0051938XQ,"I purchased this film after seeing it featured on a Youtube video ""most underated films"". I was intrigued, considering I enjoy thought-provoking artistic films...and violence. I will honestly say that most of my disappointment stems from the preconceived notion that this was going to be a bloodbath. A silent, artsy bloodbath.

Of the films 92 minute length, maybe 7 minutes are actual combat. If like me, you were hoping to see one man take on the world - this is not that kind of film. There are interesting ideas at work, and the imagery is decent, but overall I was not moved emotionally.

4520130,2,B0051938XQ,"The whole movie should have been called ' SAVAGE ' , not only is there NO interesting plot but the main character is a huge contradiction of moral values when he protects the child from being kill by others on a ship then carries him up the hill, but then he kills others without any remorse or good reason. Being a great strong warrior and then drooping his weapons and letting the Indians butcher him at the end of the story does NOT make any logical sense at all. The producer of this film failed miserably to give it any storytelling value and was over emphasizing the savage nature of the main character. Simply a waste of time There was no point to this movie.  I wanted to like it-I loved the Vikings Sagas is a favorite so I tried very hard to give this one a chance-but it NEVER came together. Wow. I assume if you were on heavy drugs or you have very low IQ you may enjoy watching this -otherwise you'll be left completely bewildered. Glad did NOT pay $10 for this-and wasted time watching it. It is FREE on Netflix",1497571200,,1025,4.283505154639175
4520131,5,B0051938XQ,"I understand this film as a parable that can be interpreted in various ways, with the one-eyed and mute warrior signifying humans who lack perfect sight and an inability to express their feelings and needs; and Valhalla signifying a promised land, a paradise, a goal that people seek, often in foolish even criminal ways, often without understanding what they are seeking.
The story begins by showing us the one-eyed warrior who was captured by Vikings and used by them for their delight, to fight against some of their warriors, as gladiators did in Rome. No one knows where this warrior came from or where he is going or what he wants out of life. He escapes from these people and kills most of them.
He comes across Viking Christians determined to post a cross in foreign lands. They are led by a man who wants to take them to the promised land, to the kingdom of Jesus, so that they can save their souls, and so that they can reap the riches that are everywhere in Jesus' land. They kill people during their trip and when they come ashore, as savages do.
A boy who was part of the Vikings from whom one-eye escaped joins him. We do not know who he is or why he joined one-eye, or why one-eye joined the Christians on their trip, by boat to Jesus' land; probably because they saw no alternative. Perhaps because they moved as life leads them without thought. The boy thinks that one-eye wants to go home. But where is home? Does one-eye know where it is?
As we watch, other questions cross our minds. Did the group land in Israel? If not, where did they land? Who is one-eye? What is the film's message about Christianity, about life, about life's goals? What is the meaning of the film's title Valhalla Rising?",1492905600,2,1714,4.496794871794871

4520135,5,B0051938XQ,"Great Independent film. Does not follow the traditional Hollywood theme. Not for the faint of heart and squeamish.

4520137,5,B0051938XQ,"I watched this on Netflix but I want the Bluray. This film is excellent and caters to highly intelligent people with a good taste in film artwork. The people giving it negative reviews don't have a clue what true artwork is and the craft of story telling events that did actually happen long ago.  This was like watching a moving book, like reading a book and having your mind generate the video right in front of you except without you having to use your imagination. This was wonderfully executed and absolutely brilliant. If I had the money I would get the Bluray but for right now having it streaming is good enough through a commercial service. Also I am glad producers and film makers actually decided to make a movie about what really did actually happen in the distant past, the kind of stuff schools are not telling in history classes cause it is not commonly accepted as fact yet beyond a shadow of a doubt such scenarios did happen in the very distant past. The creators of the film take time lines branching them together into the main artery of Columbus's New World and how each time different foreigners did first discover it they got their asses handed to them on a platter. Its funny cause it took European disease to actually conquer it and that was found out by accident.",1483056000,,1289,4.556034482758621
4520138,5,B0051938XQ,This is a very slow paced movie and it has very little speaking. The movie is very visual and meant to be enjoyed and not designed to be understood like a book would be. The movie focused on Christian Crusades pillaging and murdering non-christian groups of people simply because they do not believe in the same god. The man known as One-Eye kills his master and takes his master's son with him and leads the Christian crusades into a world that I can only assume to be a portrayal of Valhalla. But One-Eye did not kill the Christians like the Christians killed innocent people. He instead defended the kid and himself by killing them and allowing their religious beliefs to make them go insane.,1479427200,,695,4.612903225806452
4520139,5,B0051938XQ,"This movie is about a pagan acting more Christian than Christians themselves by sacrificing himself for the boy in the end.  Through this act, he shows up the Christians about how his pagan religion is superior to their Christianity.  The feckless Christians are more concerned with killin' and Crusadin' than understanding the true meaning of their religion.  They even get lost on their way to the Holy Land and wind up in N. America.  In the new, unfamiliar environment of N. America, the Christians get whacked off one by one by the red-skinned natives because their monomaniacal pursuit of Holy Land glory eclipses and blinds them to the true meaning of their religion.  In contrast, it is pagan One-Eye who acts in the most Christ-like way of all by sacrificing himself in the end to save the boy from the natives.  Despite being the best fighter on earth and probably having a good chance to kills the 70 or so natives that appear, the power of his sacrificing himself is even more effective than his awesome fighting ability to save the boy's life in the end.",1475280000,,1067,4.709677419354839
4520140,2,B0051938XQ,"Awesomely gruesome. Reminded me of a really gory 300 film, the cinemagraphics is top top notch and horrifingly beautiful. Main character is a human weapon, but a slave, he supposedly came from the sea and is the devil himself. Kills his capture's and finds his way to not the holy land, but north america. Its a really well done film with lots of fight scenes and gore, but most of it is speculation on who he is and where he came from etc. kind of meaa ingless gore, desperate crazy holy men who don't turn out to be so godly... And one by one they die in the early unforgiving brutal world.

4520144,5,B0051938XQ,"Fantastic film, but not for just anybody. It has a surreal flavor to it, similar to El Topo by Alejandro Jodorowsky. And it is no surprise either, since Nicolas Winding Refn is a huge fan of Jodorowsky. High praise goes to The Mighty Mads Mikkelsen as One Eye. His subdued intensity dominates from start to finish. Also, the soundtrack is outstanding. The DVD doesn't have any extras apart from the trailer. A director's commentary would have been awesome, but no such luck. Still, 5 stars!",1467244800,2,490,4.776470588235294
4520145,2,B0051938XQ,"A mysterious one-eyed warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) accompanies a group of Crusaders on their quest for the Holy Land, finding only a futile descent into Hell.

Director Nicolas Winding Refn treads the same ground that Werner Herzog covered much more effectively nearly forty years earlier with Aguirre: The Wrath of God.  Religious fanaticism paves the way to madness, disconnecting man from his environment and his fellow men since his high ideals are really only expressions of his own vanity and fear.  There is some impressive filmmaking and imagery on display here, but the intent to be weighty and metaphorical is too heavy-handed to be very effective.",1467244800,,654,5.20952380952381
4520146,5,B0051938XQ,"Funny how the majority of the negative reviews for this movie are ""Durr, I don't get it"". Says more about the reviewers than the film. This is a viking art movie, a violent one. It's not about ""getting it"". It's about the artfulness of it all. This is not a dumb action movie for guys looking to see vikings chop each other up and who want a solid, easily digestible plot that wraps up cleanly in the end. It's about the fascinating main character and his strangely affectionate relationship with the slave boy he comes to care for and their surreal journey. I don't know what else to say. It's about tone and mood and a very interesting main character. If your IQ is less than 120 and you haven't had at least some college (or at least have an appreciation for the arts) then forget it.",1466985600,7,787,4.360544217687075

4520148,4,B0051938XQ,One of the most different movies I have purchased.

I will give it credit for being more realistic than most historical shows of this type, with the unkempt hair, dirty faces, ragged clothes, and rude cages. Also for the survival rate of missionaries landing on a strange shore, and for being ""human"" and not saintly. I give it a two because we did make it all the way through, waiting for some Big Reveal, momentous truth, something. But the big moment never arrived. Maybe that was the point.

I can't believe I made myself sit thru it. 90% of the film was staring at people who were standing around looking painfully bored. The beginning had a short bit of action, and the scenery was beautifully filmed. That's where the positives end. It was a long, droning, torturously boring experience. There was a (fragmented) scene toward the end where it appeared that everyone involved was having a very bad acid trip. I admit, I have no idea what this scene meant to be portraying. Maybe if I went art school for film instead of graphic design I'd have an appreciation for it. Only a burned-out Werner Herzog could make a film about Vikings unbearably boring.

4520181,5,B0051938XQ,"This movie is, in a way, like an intelligence and observational skills test.  Individuals who prefer to have a film's dialogue and back-history spoon-feed the premise to them will probably be totally turned off to Valhalla Rising.  However, if you enjoy works related to mythology, history, and anthropology -- and if you have a strong stomach -- then I'd give it a go.  You'll probably love it.  There is no back-story to this film, but it helps to know a couple things:

-In Scotland, about a thousand years ago, a Christian king name Olaf Tryggvason started getting hardcore with punishment for pagan ways: first in Scotland, then in Scandinavia proper.  (In Valhalla Rising, this is why One-eye is sold: the money could be used by the chieftain to buy leniency from the coming malice of Christian missionaries and their crusaders.)

-Native American cultures typically were lenient to an enemy's children or women.  Read the accounts of General Cadwallader Colden, former governor of New York State, and other notables of the time... specifically, how they witnessed, during prisoner exchanges with the native Americans, the young colonial prisoners and women defecting back to Native American society after their release.  Significant numbers of non-combatant colonialists also chose to defect to native American society as well (Daniel Boone).  Even before that, Hernando De Soto had to posts guards on his own soldiery, specifically for this reason.  (This is probably why Are, the boy-slave, was spared by the natives once One-eye was killed)

People have written plenty of plot summaries, so read elsewhere for that.  What I think is interesting, that not many others seem have considered, is the potential that One-eye is probably deaf as well.  I draw this directly from the movie, through scenes where One-eye is totally unresponsive to noises (especially verbalization toward him which is outside his field of view), but very responsive to vibration.  For example, the water jar during their ship voyage doesn't wake him while it's rolling around on the floor, ...until it knocks against the mast -- presumably, sending vibrations through the floor of the ship.  Back in the day, before sign language, social workers, and Helen Keller, there was this old phrase ""deaf and dumb"".  The deaf is self-explanatory; the ""dumb"" part came from the fact that, because deaf people couldn't hear language, they didn't speak or learn language.  Because of that, they were only presumed ""dumb"" -- not because they had learning difficulty.  I'm not 100% sold on this idea of One-eye's deafness either.  Surely, the disemboweling of the priest (right after the priest tells him he's going to hell), and the boat scene where he appears to hear the heavy red-bearded crusader laughing, and offers him his first cup of fresh water are rebuttals to this theory.  But there are a few places where the ambient sounds are not there, and One-eye seems to be the focus of those moments.  Also, One-eye seems to look at Are sometimes in such a way as to be trying to get an impression from the boy.

According to one of the Scottish chieftains (before One-eye killed him), One-eye is ""from Hell,"" and ""full of hate"", ...but not really.  Maybe he is evil only insofar as he learned how to be a hellian from his captors who used him as a warrior-slave for their profit.  If there's any ""Hell"" about him, it is a ""conditioned"" Hell, or a ""learned"" Hell.  If your education in the world was survival-by-killing (with the absence of language or other skillset), I imagine you'd appear pretty hellacious as well.  If there is a Hell, the chieftains themselves made it, within him.

Another thing that's notable is what's *not* in the film: structures and societies.  There are absolutely no depictions of homes or villages or villagers (except the naked women enslaved by the Christians), nor are there proper churches or temples or anything of the sort.  Like art from the Far East, the natural world dominates every scene except the ship voyage.  I think this is very purposeful.  Unlike the Scottish pagan priests and their gods, or the Christian missionaries and their dogma, the natural world doesn't reward, doesn't punish, nor does it judge... it just *is*.  The thing that makes me think that this is very purposeful, is that you have no other context by which to think about or frame the character than by the actions and words of those characters themselves.  With this ""silhouette"" of the characters' nature, what unfolds in the part 5 of the film, titled ""Hell"", is a series of events of the characters succumbing to their own vices and devices, and dying:

-Scotsmen and missionaries that attempted to kill or enslave One-eye were all eventually killed by One-eye.
-The Christian priest, bathing in a sacred native American burial ground, was shot to death by the natives' arrows for his disrespect.  (Those platforms of dead bodies may have been a form of burial known as ""sky burial"".  Practiced by the Zoroastrians and pre-buddhist Bon cultures, sky burial was where the dead were laid in a high place, ascending to the afterlife by allowing predatory birds to eat them)
-One christian fighter that went missing succumbs to madness, bearing marks that appear to be derived from the culture of the native inhabitants
-Another succumbs to suicide
-One missionary gets raped by another, but incurs no death as a matter of the plot.

In every case but One-eye, the character's death is sort of ""justified"".  One-eye's death at the hands of the natives is justified, but only in the sense that One-eye was following his visions or premonitions, and a vision had indicated for him to 1) find the arrowhead in the water that would free him from captivity, 2) be on the ship voyage with the missionaries, and the 3) find the water's edge by the rocks, where he would be killed.

One of the elements that I truly love about the Valhalla Rising is its play on potentiality.  The relationship between Are and One-eye is an interesting example of this.  Late in the film it is alluded to that the boy is speaking the thoughts of One-Eye.  It's never really confirmed, and perhaps there's also some rebuttal (e.g.: why would Are seem apologetic, in his initial meeting with the Christians, of telling them that the Warrior's name is ""One-eye""?  Knowing the nature of children, and how they're bound to spin and play upon their own versions of reality, it doesn't seem unlikely that Are would assume the role of having a quasi-telepathic link to One-eye without it existing.)

Additionally, in older cultures, necklaces amulets, or effigies were given for specific purposes.  Polytheistic religions's symbolism instilled ""powers"" or curses upon the bearers.  Are's necklace or amulet, although never shown in detail, was given to him by his father, and there's a chance that it could have been a protective type of charm.  Certainly, One-eye unfailingly protected the boy with a supernatural skillset throughout the course of the movie.  So, again: alluding to the supernatural, without making it definitive; without using some sort of special effects to validate the idea.

And on top of all that, there is a lot of religious paralleling:  There is a final interaction at the top of the mountain between Are, One-eye, the priest's son, and another missionary.  The way it's characterized, it's as if it were sermon on the mount.  Another religious parallel is that One-eye foresees his own death.  He knows he's going to die, and so builds a cairn at the natives' holy place -- just before he starts bathing in water, as if a baptism.

And so, given the outcome of all the characters, there's an irony in those opening lines:
""Men came bearing crosses and drove the heathen to the fringes of the earth.""

The cross-bearing men all died.  The ones that achieved any sense of salvation were the final crusaders who entertained the idea that ""it matters how you leave this world.""  One-eye was driven to the fringe of the earth, and although he was a heathen, (out of all of the characters except the boy) he was the least hedonistic.  I'm inclined to believe that the statement being made here is of the ""natural purity"" of One-eye -- a purity that is derived from his disability.  Because he is mute and (probably) deaf, he is outside the context of the cultures around him.  And also, because he is tempered by death from his warrior past, he is also at comfort to meet his own -- the salvation of the boy being the purpose of his own.  Because One-eye is not engaged in culturally-established values and language, he is also not corrupted by them.  Once he freed himself from his pagan captors, he is not obligated to follow anyone.  He is not like the Christian missionaries & crusaders that he sees imprisoning women and murdering their enemies, wanting to conquer the Holy land for reasons of wealth or spiritual value.  He is not like the Scottish chieftains, enslaving others to fight for profit, in the hopes of saving their own society.  Instead, One-eye follows his own path, enlightened by the visions he sees in his sleep.  He does little more than simply reciprocate the energies directed at him, until the very end when he submits.",1426636800,3,9229,4.888817480719794
4520182,1,B0051938XQ,"The only reason I gave it one star was because there was no negative option.  This movie fails on so many levels it hard to decide where to start.  Normally, I would start with the plot, but in this case there is none.  As for dialogue, there was so little the entire script could probably be printed on a single sheet of paper, double spaced.  What little dialogue there was, was so poorly delivered and intelligible because of the unnecessarily loud and moronic musical score.  There were a few occasions where I had to rewind two or three times and turn the volume all the way up in an attempt to hear what was being said.  Eventually I gave up and moved on, hoping beyond all hope that something, ANYTHING, would happen.  Given the title, I also thought this movie would have something to due with Vikings.  It does not.  The ONE thing that would have made the film better, would have been if it was in Danish, with English subtitles.  At least I would have had something to read.

4520188,1,B0051938XQ,"Ya know I don't typically write reviews no matter how much of how little I like or dislike a film and the people who make the films we love and hate deserve our respect and appreciation. With that being said I just finished watching this movie and I had high hopes for it after the first little bit especially after One Eye escaped his captors, well that's pretty much where the film ends because it's the absolutely most boring 1:35 minutes I've ever spent doing anything, I mean there's mostly extended periods with absolutely nothing happening, no dialog no action no fights no nothing it pretty much could have been a better movie if it had been a short film that ended after the escape because pretty much thats where the excitement ends and I use the term excitement very loosly because  it's not very exciting and then the music intensifies as if building to something happening and then nothing, nix, nada, zip, zilch, zero, big ol goose egg and then the film  ends with the hero that's supposed to have supernatural strength walks up and let's savages beat him to death with clubs and even that was boring and left me feeling vastly underwhelmed!!!! And that's an hour and 35 minutes of my life I could have spent doing anything else, even taking a nap would have been more exciting then then that...

I'm sure there are those goobers out there that look at this as a work of art but I am not one of them, I know the writers and directors were probably trying to achieve something with this movie but I didn't get it at all and I find it funny they explicitly describe one eye as having supernatural strength but I never saw anything close to supernatural strength not even mildly strong? I really expected a good high energy action fight film after reading the description but never saw anything and I even thought maybe the broadcast ended up recording a different movie then what was supposed to be recorded because of how slow and boring the entire movie was. If you have nothing to do and want to waste an hour and a half then go for it and watch a very boring, misleading film that leaves you confused and not knowing what the heck you just watched or what the point of the whole story was I mean if the movie had at least a plot and better story line then it would have been better by some measure? But there was no plot no mean duo dialog just a few guys and a kid walking or sitting in a boat not speaking 90% of the movie so again you end the film saying what the hl Did I just watch?  hopefully you'll have it recorded on your dvr so you can fast forward through the most boring uneventful parts and then you can cut the movie down to a good half hour, because honestly that's exactly what the movie felt like to me, a 20 or 30 minute short artsie film that the director figured hey we still have film left in the camera so let's just make some crap up for another hour or until we run out of film...

Sorry if you liked this movie but I really did expect a fairly good action historical type movie and was severely underwhelmed in the end

4520220,5,B0051938XQ,"Simply one of the most stunning films I've seen in 20 years. This was the the first Refn film I saw. I now own all of his films. I can understand the bad reviews. These reviews are given by people who expect fast editing, big cg..ya know ...your typical American film. If you want a big budget cg viking film your not going to find it here. What you will find in this film is genius filming. Art. Metaphor.
And dark ambiance surrounded by ritualistic violence done in a way that's almost unheard of in today's film world. How does one explain the purpose of the one eye? There is none..other than he stands as a metaphor of god..the devil..vengeance... filmed in a terrain that is so ghostly and beautiful that it creates a sense of truly being there. One becomes sucked into this desolate tale and landscape. I'm not going to explain the film. You can read other reviews...and I must say this film is no less at a high amazon rating than Refn's other films(fearX, Bronson,the pusher trilogy,drive, and only god forgives). Most are at a 2-3 star if it's lucky. I find this sad. But there are those out there that do see this film and filmaker for what he can really accomplish for almost no money. And..he gets high paid famous actors to be in his films like Ryan Gosling,Brian Cranston Mads, Mikkelsen,John Turturo and Tom Hardy. Exceptional actors that take far less money to be in a Refn film. I think that sais something about the filmmaker.
Forget the naysayers and enjoy the experience you will see. No it won't be fast paced , no edits every 2 seconds.....just something that if you keep watching will suck you in and leave you speechless and completely amazed...either that or pissed off and confused. But Personally...I loooooove this film and all of this artsists other films. Can't wait to see what he will do next.",1401408000,13,1826,4.570121951219512

'Valhalla Rising', better known as 'Valhalla Embarrassed' is one of those extraordinarily bad movies one simply cannot stop watching, like a low budget train wreck with soundtrack provided by a woozy drunkard on kazoo.

The 'supernaturally strong warrior' is seemingly neither supernaturally strong enough that his super-naturalness is readily apparent to the viewer, nor enough to free himself from his silly primitive confines, apparently designed by a set dresser who's never experienced an actual Scottish winter, or summer even. Not to mention confinement. Perhaps his supernatural strength is resistance to hypothermia? Wearing his hair in a nifty samurai-esque topknot? Keeping a straight face while filming nonsense?

After some truly silly violence showing, symbolically(?), what a great warrior One Eye is we discover that Dopey Blond Boy is, of course, suddenly telepathic. The viewer is then treated to a nails-on-chalkboard series of Vikings / underemployed-Scottish-actors adrift in a mist, occasionally dying from ennui & making grim faces at their sad, misty, becalmed state: alas, they cannot move their longboat. Which has OARS in it. Seriously. It has been a while since university but I seem to recall Vikings being rather good with oars and boats and violent nautical pursuits in general. Perhaps those skills evaporated once they began uttering vague & completely a-historical comments about Christianity while chained & obligatorily naked ladies sat around them in the heather?

<Spoiler>
There are any number of excellent artistic films that make much of little; typically these films don't invent random bits of history as straw men to be destroyed in pursuit of Art, and the easy racism of the film's ending with mud-covered 'savages' behaving with random, historically inaccurate savagery is disgusting.

Much as I enjoy gutting abysmal filmmaking I'll have to leave it at this: Don't Waste Your 92 Minutes. Or your money.",1399248000,,2073,5.5062893081761

Mads Mikkelsen takes on the role of a mute Viking slave who has to fight for his masters' entertainment. His performance is noteworthy in the sense that he needs to project all his thoughts without a single line of dialogue. In that he performs well, but the film cannot get away from trying so hard to be artistic while falling flat. Commentaries on faith and ancient history are lost on a story that really failed to pull me in. It was interesting, but ultimately left me wanting more.

""No plot"", they say. Well, actually, it's a pretty easy to follow sequence of events.
""Bad acting"", they say. Rubbish. Every character is convincing.
""My wife didn't like the violence"", they say. Then she should be watching ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" or something.
""No talent"", they say. You try making a film as beautiful and haunting as this!
""I don't get it"", they say. Have you tried?

Also, I don't understand why everyone refers to the characters with Scottish accents as ""Vikings"" and ""Norsemen"". Aren't they Scots?

Overall, get out of the habit of sitting there and having everything handed to you. Don't just be entertained, be interested. Feel the emotions and atmospheres in the film.

It's ideal for indy film fanatics, Alpha Males, and fans of Mads Mikkelsen.  In 1,000 AD the Christians were wiping out the pagans.  A group of fervent Christians in a European location I'm not sure of set sail for the Holy Land.  They take with them the character called One-Eye, a mute slave who has escaped the pagans.  In general, he is beaten, disrespected, and treated horribly, but he's the hero so naturally he's the most clever of them all.  As One-Eye, Mads Mikkelsen manages to still stay handsome and sexy although horribly scarred and dirty, unable to speak and with one eye missing.  They get hold of a large sailboat and set sail for Jerusalem.  They're so ""brilliant"" that they sit there in the boat with the sails rolled up, not even rowing (presumably because there's no wind), and are sure they'll end up in Jerusalem just because they're in the water.  Finally they see land, and SPOILER, it's not Jerusalem at all.  What is it?  Hint:  Green trees, thousands of them, some of them pine trees.  I don't think they have any of those in Jerusalem.  Yes, it is the New World, the some-day-to-be United States or Canada.  And yes, there are Indians.  They are called Indians in the closing titles, so I am calling them Indians.

The main character (brilliantly portrayed by Danish actor Mads Dittmann Mikkelsen ) is deeply fascinating as his intelligence is slowly revealed as he repeatedly outwits, survives. Without uttering a word. You'll swear you have an intimate understanding of this man...due to superb use of surrounding characters who come up with their own interpretations.

It was a journey into a past that was violent, cold and brutal and where a wrong choice could kill you.  People often make comments about how they would like to go back in time without considering what a dirty, hungry and freaking cold existence it was.  This film really reminded me about how much modern life has softened us.  I also found the main character complicated (actually l find most men complicated!).  He was a caged and chained slave forced to repeatedly fight to the death for the amusement of his owner.  Yet he wasn't needlessly cruel - he did what he had to do to survive.

The plot is that he escapes, and presumably for the first time in his life he is making decisions for himself.

I would be willing to bet that the writer came up with almost all of this in a drug fueled dream and then woke up before the end.  So he had to come up with some sort of ending.

He then leads the Christians to America, where he erects the ""Temple Of Apollyon"" by stacking the rocks into an obelisk standing before a reflecting pool. We see his 'inner-reptoid' or ""Ka"" enter the water after his host-body is killed - meaning the Reptoid has done the job and is returning to, well...wherever Reptoidz come from. ""Ameri-Ka"" actually means ""Land Of Reptilian Possessed People"". (That's why we've got the 'Eye' on our dollar.)

So when I saw Valhalla Rising, I was pleasantly surprised.

i was tired yet didn't want to see a drama. I wanted action, but it was late at night so i couldn't have the volume too high. This movie was perfect for the mood I was in.  this matters, because it was not a movie to watch with a group, or with too much excitement. it is a patient movie, and i appreciated it that much more because of this.

some other reviews here are just amazing. i cannot write like they do, but i can say that this movie didn't try too hard, but did just enough to pull me in, show me brief but brutal violence, and took me on a journey.

4520410,3,B0051938XQ,"After reading the varying reviews on this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.

First, the review that states there is only about 10 minutes of total dialogue in the movie is inaccurate. The characters converse throughout the movie, except for the main character, who remains silent throuhout the entire movie. The script is not heavy nor complex and there are some periods of silence. However, the script and type of movie does not allow for understanding the background of everything that is happening nor the characters. You just kinda have to use your imagination. I don't feel this detracts from the movie much.

The main character has no name but he is given a nickname, OneEye. The movies details part of his life. We are told little about him. He is mean, he can fight and he is ruthless. Apparently he is known and people consider him evil. He also has another side but that would be too much of a spoiler.

There is a boy. His background is also not well explained. His association with OneEye is one of circumstance.

There are three groups of men. Two unfriendly, one so-so friendly. The story seems to revovle around OneEye's experiences with these three groups.

Honestly, I don't know how to explain this movie any better without it being a complete spoiler because this movie is very basic in its presentation of the story.

This is a movie with a moderate amount of intense violence. When OneEye kills someone, it is often gory. So, if that type of stiff bothers you, this may not be the movie for you.

Although I found things confusing and slow at times, I am glad I watched it til the end. Overall, I enjoyed it and the ending made me rethink my impression of OneEye. When I understood 'why he did what he did' I liked him a lot better.

Odin is god of war and violence, but also of wisdom, poetry, and journey which I think One-eye is a good portrayal of. Odin was also know to have foresight of coming events, and One-eye clearly displays his ability to read the future. Furthermore, in my opinion this film is depicting a sort of Norse Pagan ""Pilgrimage"" to the New World, similar in a way to the Pilgrims who fled to the new world for spiritual freedom, Paganism is dying in the Old World and fleeing to the New World. Also, Norse Paganism and Native American religions have some similarities such as shamanic rituals, which may be the reason for the stress upon One-eye's understanding of the Indians.

4520424,5,B0051938XQ,"Sometimes you want simple, mindless entertainment that you don't really care if you remember. Sometimes you crave a movie that's completely different from anything you've ever seen. VALHALLA RISING satisfies that ""completely different"" craving for me.

Because it's both so weird and so visually beautiful, I can't recommend it enough. Especially if, like me, you tend to think you've just about seen it all.

I've watched it twice now. This is one movie that shockingly combines history and hyper-realism with breathtaking landscapes. BONUS: The story's so unique that it defies every movie formula you can think of! For the departure from Hollywood formula alone, VR was worth it to me. And I will watch it again.

Like action films? Plenty of extreme fight scenes here, but even though mostly black and white [or black and white-like, you'll see what I mean, it's mostly a stark effect], I found the fights to be more realistic than any martial arts film. Actual consequences of extreme violence are well depicted. Fortunately, the same intensity, like an eye that cannot lie, immerses us, right along with the clueless travelers, into vast forests and areas of natural beauty.

While the stark, ""mostly B&W"" effect may put some viewers off at first, I was surprised it had the opposite effect on me --drawing me right into its bizarre combination of beauty and adventure, realistic violence and a kind of subterranean dread you rarely find, even in horror films.

If you wonder what life was really like in non-Romanized Europe 1,000 years ago, and what could possibly convince people to drop everything and leave everything they knew for another world, I'm betting you could watch a dozen documentaries and not get such a complete sense of how it might have been as you will in VR. After college, I went through a period of fascination in ancient Norse and Northern European cultures. It's 25% of my gene pool, after all. Between documentaries and news coverage of digs at ancient sites, I picked up enough background to mention here that the people who made VALHALLA RISING took the time to fold in the research, and create a shockingly authentic world. Hint: Ren Fair not.

Religion divides the world today. That's one more reason why, hroughout this film, it was fascinating to watch what people of different cultures and different lands chose to believe --about what their beliefs demanded of them, and what being human means.

Finally, if, like me, you became a Mads Mikkelson fan after his sleek, non-stop villainy in CASINO ROYALE, I hope you see VALHALLA RISING just to witness the range MM is capable of. The physical toll the action in this film takes is right there to see. It's no exaggeration to say that Mikkelson as The Shaman ""One Eye"" gives a performance as believable and, I felt, just as important as Robert DeNiro in another classic B&W, RAGING BULL.

By the way, I don't like to land on spoilers in Amazon movie reviews, so I try to make sure there aren't any in mine.",1379894400,3,2994,4.845401174168297

I call it almost pointless, which may sound like an negative thing, but it's part of the energy of this story that made for such a good telling of it.  Not to compare one to the other by no means, but think: Seinfeld (""It's a show about nothing"").  This is basically what I mean.

Very well made; the cinematography, angles, quirks, the acting - all spot on.  This movie also turned me to seeing Mads Mikkelsen (what a name, right!) a someone else other than Le Chiffre in Casino Royale; his fight scenes were quite realistic here, great filming.

I also enjoyed the setting of the storyline.  Its a pleasure to see a movie that plays on the what-ifs that could've taken place amongst the interaction between such strong cultures.  It's been tried before, but with this film, at least I can take the storyline a bit more serious - fictionally speaking - than ""The Eagle,"" which was semi entertaining, not compared to this work of art.

This film is meant to make you uncomfortable, and it succeeds. After watching it, though, images from the film stuck with me, and so I watched parts of it again. . . and then again. The film has grown on me: it's one of the few films that I watch repeatedly for the sake of boosting my own level of angst. I won't get into the meaning of the film (others have covered that well), but I do recommend it as an original and haunting experience.

But not to everyone. Some people are very much attached to snappy dialogue, fast pace, and a neatly packaged plot. If so (and there is nothing wrong with that) may I suggest watching Lord of the Rings again. This movie would be a trainwreck at an average American Cineplex, where audiences expect polished effects and one liners. Appreciating the film requires patience and the ability to not have a traditional plot laid out before you, and it's not going to appeal to many people (as I said, I didn't exactly like it upon my first viewing).

The chiefs need money (a foreign concept to them) to buy off or placate the Christian onslaught into their dwindling and remote lands- the last redoubts of Paganism in Dark Age Europe.

And this ""One Eye"" as the small boy- the only person who can get near him without immediately being killed calls him- is the embodiment of justified hate and rage.  There isn't a single person he kills- other than the other slaves he is forced to kill in combat- that doesn't deserve it.  A slave forced to murder other slaves so Chiefs can fend off the murderous Christian exterminationists.  ""One Eye"" is a man who sees things more clearly than men with both eyes.

I watched this movie alone, so had no one to bounce theories off of - which I like to do w/ movies. Anyway, this movie is different than your typical American action movie, but is worth your time.

Valhalla Rising is nothing like you've ever seen when it comes to portraying the Vikings: because it's actually accurate to the core, just gritty and does not pull any punches. This film will show you the true nature and even their ugly violent sides, without holding anything back. Also one of the main things I loved about the film is that it's very slow-paced, and almost has an arthouse feel to it. It's very atmospheric, tranquil, and it takes you to a whole another world. The only personal complaint I had with this film was that it was in English. It was a Scottish English, but English nonetheless. I really wished they could have done it in the ancient Nordic tongue. But the good thing is that there is barely any dialogues. This film is more about the atmosphere and traveling with the characters to this world of Vikings.

4520576,1,B0051938XQ,"Our Netflix queue has been providing a steady stream of historical dramas about the Crusades, so we decided to watch something different with Valhalla Rising...and discovered that it's about a bunch of Norsemen who sail off to fight in the Crusades.  They never get there - that would make for a far more interesting movie - but instead land (SPOILER RISING) in North America where they encounter ""skraelings,"" hostile Native American warriors who aren't rolling out the red carpet for the accidental explorers.

I've always thought the Norsemen vs. Native American conflicts were interesting stuff, and yet no director seems to be able to do the topic justice.  Pathfinder, which trod much of the same territory from the view of the Native Americans, was a flop.  I didn't think it was possible, but Valhalla Rising is actually worse.

Our protagonist, if you can call him that, is a mute warrior/slave named One-Eye (Mads Mikkelsen). He is so dangerous that when he's not ripping peoples' throats out with his teeth, One-Eye spends his time trussed up in a cage.  Only a young slave boy named Are (Maarten Stevenson) is allowed to go near him; I like to think this is because One-Eye was once a father and has a code against killing children, but I'm probably giving director and scriptwriter Nicolas Winding Refn too much credit. Refn's got grander goals in mind for Valhalla Rising.

After slaughtering his captors in graphic fashion, complete with bright red CGI blood, One-Eye comes upon a small group of Norse crusaders. Led by The General (Ewan Stewart), they have one of the stupidest plans in history: to go on the Crusades by sailing off in a random destination.

The film is broken down into parts, so it was easy to determine the moment when the film lost me: Part III Men of God. Up to that point I was tolerating the repeated flashforwards (presumably One-Eye's visions), the long still shots of people staring off into space in the foreground while people stare off into space in the background, and the blood red-tinted shots of people staring off into space.  There's no score to speak of, just occasional musical riffs for tension, and there's almost no dialogue to speak of either (One Eye's mute, remember?).  There's literally nothing to speak of.

Part III consists of the men slowly going mad in the fog as they jet off to the Crusades.  These are Norsemen who show an astounding lack of navigational skill.  There's no compelling reason for One-Eye to join them.  Indeed, given that he hates just about everybody except the boy, you'd think he'd avoid being trapped with a bunch of morons who haven't the first clue how to sail. But no, One-Eye joins them and so do we, spending each agonizing moment waiting for them all to die.

Unfortunately, they don't.  Instead, they land somewhere near North America (maybe Greenland? I stopped caring).  Are these not the worst Norsemen sailors ever?  When an arrow pierces one of the Norsemen from seemingly nowhere, the crew and the audience begins to believe they are in hell.  And for all intents and purposes, we are.

What ensues is a beat-you-over-the-head allegory for Christianity vs. paganism.  After finally getting around to slaughtering the rest of the group, One-Eye heads out on his own. The now completely mad General stays behind to establish a new Jerusalem. The priest of the group (Gary Lewis) is literally backstabbed by the General, but stumbles on to follow One-Eye into the wilderness.

Where is he going? What is his plan?  Since One-Eye is a symbolic manifestation of the pagan spirit, he apparently doesn't need motivation.  He's a force of nature, a representation of Odin, and he must die for our sins. Fans of Norse history know this will not end well.

Symbolism can't save this film. The dreadfully long stills, the lack of dialogue, and the cartoonish violence all amount to an art film with a capital ""A"". This is a message movie gussied up as a historical piece.  Its religious symbolism can be reduced to an inverted Christ allegory.  In the film, it's the pagan who must sacrifice himself for our sins; in reality, it's the audience's patience that suffers most.",1329609600,22,4165,4.846045197740113
4520577,4,B0051938XQ,"Mads Mikkelsen is enigmatic and charismatic.  He's fearsome, silent, ominous, brooding.  It's pretty amazing that he does such an excellent acting job without saying a word throughout the entire film.  Being a great actor, though, it's not surprising... it's only surprising because we're so used to clever banter, catchphrases and pretentious babble filling our ears as we watch a film.  It's easy to forget that acting without words is an art.  His performance alone is worth 3 or 4 stars.  Whether you dig or get the film is irrelevant... Mads is amazing.  He carries the film all the way.

Story-wise, the film is at times quite surreal and ends in such a non-Hollywood sort of way that absolutely guarantees a low rating from many ""reviewers"".  If you recall Terry Gilliam's battles to end ""Brazil"" the way he wanted, and not the Hollywood way, you'll have a feel for how this goes.  It's quite brave, really.  At the same time, it brings Mikkelsen's wild, dangerous character to a level of sacrifice and honor that few protagonists ever attain.

If you glance at the ratings, you'll see that people either love or hate this film.  I've got to point out, though... these people giving this film 1 star shouldn't be rating films anywhere.  A 1 is a preposterous rating for a film of such excellent cinematic quality, not to mention Mikkelsen's performance.  Now, the easy thing to say is that these folks give a 1 to anything that doesn't have explosions in it, or f-bombs, or isn't an over-hyped piece of Hollywood excess.  No doubt that is the case for many of these people... they'd be better off watching ""Armageddon"" for the 400th time than watching this film, which requires some thought and appreciation.  But maybe they didn't get into it... fine.  But a 1 rating is a joke.

4520581,2,B0051938XQ,"There's something mesmerizing about an action film that devotes such long stretches to wordless panoramas of breathtakingly beautiful landscape accompanied by a low-key industrial-noise soundtrack. The warriors in this epic (?) spend much of their time posing in exquisite framings, apparently for an album cover or a perfume ad.

In between are the brutal killings, which on paper amount to a plot little more psychologically complex than an average kung-fu or cannibal island film, yet the photography is so lovingly polished, and the symbolism so thickly laid on, that one watches Valhalla Rising with more interest than a direct-to-video shocker.

(SPOILER ALERT)
The hero is a sort of Clint Eastwood (nameless), Charles Bronson (untalkative), Toshiro Mifune (disciplined) avenger, with hints of supernatural/pre-Christian wisdom (the one eye points to Odin) and a sense of self-sacrifice (Jesus, obviously).

Some mumbo-jumbo in the opening titles suggests that the film will be about the clash between ancient religion and Christianity, but this doesn't pan out, partly because the Norsemen are arguably the least sympathetic characters in the lot. And in any case, what logical consistency can you expect from a film where the protagonists find themselves accidentally floating upstream?",1324080000,3,1294,5.625641025641026
4520582,5,B0051938XQ,"I don't review films to often but I have liked this movie since the very first time I saw it when it came out. Most people I talk to hate this film because of how oddly it is put together and because of how it is paced. While I can't say I blame anyone for disliking this film I can say that those who hate it have probably missed the point of the movie. I'm writing this review from the precept that the reader has seen the movie so beware of spoilers ahead.

  The way I always looked at the movie is that from the very start One eye's journey was to travel to the place where he would die. I think he went to that far off land land to die. He's a viking, in a time when pagan religion is looked down upon and destroyed. In a way one eye probably feels that native American's are a distant kinsman of his. Him dying represents the elimination of a foreign threat to another polytheistic people's way of life.' In a way the Christian's traveling/dying is One Eye's moral victory over the crusades and christian opposition to his way of life. There are many other themes through out this movie but to me this is what the movie is over all about.

  Aside from the interesting structure of the movie, the film is worth seeing just for the way it is shot. Every shot in the movie is deliberately done to represent a symbolic meaning to the film. Above all the movie just looks beautiful. Every shot is like a work of art on a canvas.",1323993600,,1431,4.166666666666667
4520583,5,B0051938XQ,"Fairly accurate as far as tales go, Enslaving gladiators, betting, having a young slave boy caring for a dangerous man, his escape was classic.  Coming across Christians Crusaders and joining them, they become lost and drifted into one of North Americas rivers, encountering Native Americans who hide and attack with range weapons, classic again, One-Eye understands they don't stand a chance of survival against a superior enemy, during the ""HELL"" sequence I can only conclude that the ""drink"" they imbibe in was probably a mixture of water, honey and magic mushrooms that would continue to grow in a container if it didn't get to hot or cold.  Those mushrooms easily found on both continents.  One-Eyes decision to sacrifice himself in the last sequence, also classic, so the Native Americans would allow the child to live since trying to fight them would have resulted in both their deaths.  The boy either found a ride back home, or just survived on the coastline of North America.  No real mystery to the story, just a bleak reminder that not everything was coming up roses during that time, it must of been during the middle crusades because of the ""introduction"" of Christianity, and the supersitions involved with both pagan and early christian folks.  Not a bad story about a harsh time in history.  Not a movie for those who ""need"" to be entertained.

4520585,5,B0051938XQ,"An invigorating, mystical and very bloody look at human nature. One-Eye, a mute fighting champion who is kept locked in a cage by his Pagan captors, escapes and runs into a group of early christian, witch-burning crusaders who are about to embark on a journey to the holy lands to build a new jerusalem. Their contempt for non-christians drives them and they stand firm by their beliefs. One-Eye's captors also stand hard by their own pre-christian beliefs, which doesn't really get them very far - they spend their time pitting men against one another in pointless fighting to the death. Upon his escape a small boy follows One-Eye and the Crusaders into their longship and an eerie, timeless Ocean voyage wherein they are becalmed in an all enveloping fog and slowly, one by one they begin to lose their powers of reasoning. But this is only half the journey, the ship is carried inland up a river and the half-dead group find themselves alone in a strange and apparently empty land..

You have to read between the lines here, Valhalla Rising is no ordinary film about Vikings. The films most telling moments are in its silences and sweeping photography, pitting the handful of warriors against an empty land and against,ultimately, themselves. Only the amorality of the captivating Mikkelson is left unscathed as he decides what is to be his own fate. His axe cuts through the ignorant dogma of the crusaders or the greed of the warriors, gambling upon his fighting abilities in the films opening sequences. What gives anyone the right to claim somewhere as their own? to impose their will upon another culture? Western imperialism in the 9th Century or just territorial squabbling from ignorant barbarians?
What really drives the film is the fact that although it poses many questions, offers many solutions and even comments on itself - there is never a moment when it offers up deciding arguments or solutions to anything and its characters are left to work it out for themselves.

If you were looking for a straight up action film this will disappoint you, for it isn't an action film. Hypnotic and dreamlike in the manner of Aguirre the Wrath of God or The Thin Red Line, brutal and bloody in the manner of more recent films such as Ironclad or Beowulf and Grendel but on a different level entirely. Director Refn has created an intellectual, unflinching and raw examination of the dark parts of the human animal (as he did in the equally stunning Bronson and his earlier Pusher sequence of films) which has been confounding people since its release. Even the trailer seems to be struggling for a way of describing what lays within and has opted for the easy, action film route.

The DVD is a slim package featuring the film, it's trailer and nothing else. So no extra's, not even a commentary- which is a shame as it would be interesting to see what Winding Refn's thought processes were during production. Oh well.",1319414400,9,2924,4.7976190476190474
4520586,1,B0051938XQ,This movie seemed to have great potential. I sat waiting in anticipation for the entire length of the film. I was left sadly disappointed and distraught.

4520587,3,B0051938XQ,"Bloody, muddy, quiet, and cinematically beautiful, ""Valhalla Rising"" is not for everyone.  I would wager it's not for most viewers, in fact.  Taking a somewhat controversial theme that seems somewhat overused and overaccepted these days (the Viking discovery of the New World) as well as overturning the Action Hero trope on its head (his Hero, ""One-Eye,"" does not only not speak but is pretty much impassive, is brutally effective in physical conflict, is feared by the Vikings he encounters due to some barely articulated reputation regarding murders within another clan, is regarded almost as hatred and death embodied, is coverered in strange tattoos and scars--and by the end of the film, we know pretty much as much about him as we did in the beginning!), director Refn attempts to throw convention on its head while simultaneously expanding the subject matter by showing man's search for redemption.  Which, in his hero One-Eye's ultimate death, may be less redemption than just a death of his own choosing.

Certain questions are raised which are never answered, both simplistic (why doesn't One-Eye speak, as it's not discussed as to whether he cannot speak or simply refuses to speak) and more complex (if the Vikings believe the New World is hell, and that One-Eye is from hell, does that mean One-Eye is really from the New World, and has therefore returned home)?  Could he be a demonic agent, or even the Devil himself?  Is returning home a metaphor for redemption?  Metaphorically or actually, nothing is ever clear.  The dialogue is mediocre and actors have a tendency to talk past each other or about each other, rather than clearly communicating, and I think this contributes (quite deliberately, I'm sure, on the director's part) to creating this grand atmosphere of uncertainty.  To be honest, the film is often contrived and it's tedious at times, but it is also fairly enjoyable to observe.  Many times I felt more like an observer than a participant, which I suppose is not really a good thing--I generally feel a good film draws you into the story so you feel as if you are inhabiting the bodies or minds of the characters--but it is acceptable for the 2 hours of this film.  Be advised of brutal, graphic violence and (at times) simply inexplicable behavior (I'm speaking at this point about the rape of one Viking by another at the end of the film).

Early into this movie I began to view it as a grad student's attempt to explain realism through a Viking saga.  When viewed as an attempt to explain political realism through an poorly applied version of the ""stag hunt"" game, the movie takes on a special, weird significance.  View each man as his own state, a person who can only responsibily concern himself with his own power and security, and the acts--from One-Eye's brutal domination of fighters sent against him in the beginning of the film to his adoption into the crusading group of Vikings (literally crusading--they mean to go to the Holy Land but, apparently, sleeping is not a good way to negotiate the ocean and the stumble into the New World), as well as the invariably, violently successful actions of the natives when the Vikings bumble into contact with the natives--take on a significance.  Even One-Eye's adoption of the boy as traveling companion (friend would be too strong a word, I think) increases One-Eye's relative power (by granting him the ability to communicate--though even this is confused, as it's not certain the boy really speaks for One-Eye, or if he simply speaks) through an alliance.  At the end of the film, when One-Eye has apparently decided it is his time to die, he simply abandons the boy, and his alliance, because it is no longer worthwhile.

By the end of the film I was confused about redemption.  As I suppose, we all are!  I was not certain, in the end, this was really one of the points of the film.  The four most critical characters--a Christian proselytizer, his Viking chieftain friend, the boy, and One-Eye himself--all seemed concerned with it, and with the exception of the boy, all three seemed to demand it.  There are discussions of home, and returning there, but no one ever does.  Yet, the redemption-seekers die, and it was unclear if any of the three felt they'd attained it.  In the end, perhaps that's the greatest issue to be worked through.  Redemption is not always there to be had.",1317427200,15,4380,4.840482573726542
4520588,4,B0051938XQ,"Nicolas Winding Refn is a major force in the cinema. This mythical journey to the supossed Holy land remarks admirably the breakthrough between the wild nature and feverish beliefs.

The film is both brutal and at the same time quiet and subtle. The landscapes are harsh and beautiful, as is the cinematography. There is much more to this film than the negative reviewers seemed to understand. I think people think 'Vikings/Crusades -- oh, must be a gruesome non-stop action fest', and because the film doesn't easily fit into any one category, perhaps it's a bit too complex for then, this is not a film for people who like to be mindlessly spoon-fed their movies. This is a thinking person's action piece (not something you get from Hollywood)... imagine if Ingmar Bergman wrote and directed Conan, you might have ended up with something like Valhalla Rising.

Not to say it's a perfect film, and it's probably not for everyone, but people who just gave it a knee-jerk 1 rating I think wanted Clash of the Titans (in 3-D! woohoo) or the new Conan movie, not something that requires careful viewing and some thought to actually 'get' it.

One can ""feel"" the movie, can feel the One Eye's experiences. The bleakness of this warrior's existence is stunning, and the lack of communication makes the darkness of what might have been in these ages even more apparent. It's only natural that he seeks an honorable death - after he thinks he had already reached Valhalla.

4520596,1,B0051938XQ,"This movie started out well enough.  It's told in six Chapters and despite the lack of dialogue and the somewhat cryptic nature of the setting, characters and script, I was digging the film up until about, oh, the end of Chapter 2.  The scenery is gorgeous in a mysteriously misty sort of way and the main character is so much of an enigma early on that I couldn't help but be intrigued even though I really didn't have a clue what was happening.

Unfortunately, enigmatic can only hold a person's attention for so long.  A fifteen minute boating sequence where nothing happens except for prolonged scenes where people stare out into orange or black fog caused me to loose focus and start thinking about what I had to do the next day.  Then the characters are suddenly in an alpine setting where I'm treated to more abstract scenes where they do, well, nothing except walk around and stare wistfully at the admittedly beautiful landscape and occasionally talk about where they are and what they should do next.  Cue a drug trip where the characters do some crazy stuff like dig holes in the mud, then more walking around, a single sixty second fight scene that I saw coming a mile away (even though I approached it at the speed at which a one-legged turtle crawls), then some more walking around, and then... Well you get the idea.  The entire soundtrack of the film consists of wind blowing and water rippling and the occasional atonal muddle of muted electric guitars, which does nothing to move the film along at all.  The characters were undeveloped and there's no reason to shed a tear or even care when they're discarded by the script.  And if I had to see one more head silhouetted by the sky or close-up shot of a squinting face squished onto the right or left side of the screen, I was going to scream.  Such stylistic touches were interesting in the first ten minutes, but they got old quickly, especially because they weren't bookended by scenes with anything interesting happening.

I don't know - maybe there was a point to all of this but it was lost to me underneath the weight of the film's impenetrable atmosphere of self-importance.  There seemed to be some underlying message about religion buried underneath all the pretensious weightiness, but I sure can't be bothered to watch the movie again to try to figure out what it is.  I'm not one of those who can't watch a film unless it's filled with 120 minutes of cartoon violence, but even a thought-provoking movie has to do something to hold a viewer's interest.  Good dialogue, attractive music, interesting characters, varied visuals, SOMETHING.

4520600,3,B0051938XQ,"This was mis sold in the UK, pretending to be a Viking epic and has recieved harsh criticism for it. At least in the US it has been more honest, so is it any good really?

It is an unusual film a sort of Ingmar Bergman meets Derek Jarman only with a better camera. It is supposed to be a fantasy and as such it is hard to work out what the actual plot is. Starring Mads Mikkelsen as a one eyed sort of prize fighter, he is treated like an animal only let out for fight to the death. He apparently is owned by Barde(I got that from the cover), who is a wealthy Scotsman who obtained him for his fighting skills. If he is such a lethal fighting machine, how was he ever caught?

Any way he escapes; killing everyone except a young lad who comes along and appears to be able to understand the mute `One Eye'. I thought it was going to be a Christian versus Pagan type thing as Christianity is a thread throughout the film. The old sort of Christianity mind, crusading and killing; not the modern sort of caring and turning the other cheek etc. They meet up with some would be crusaders and then go off on a strange voyage to either the Holy Land of to establish a New Jerusalem.

This is a slow, often claustrophobic, stylish and atmospheric film. Writer and director Nicholas Winding Refn clearly knew what he wanted to create; the studio I think had different ideas. He uses music and imagery to drive the narrative forward and whilst it works, the swift and violent changes in pace -there are snippets of violent flask backs and/or premonitions- actually break your concentration. It is like being hooked and somehow getting off the line. It is only 86 minutes long, but does seem a whole lot longer and it leaves so much unanswered that I was left undecided as to whether this is an excellent art house film, that I was unable to get; or slightly disjointed and possibly overly self indulgent. A sort of triumph of style over substance. In the end I think it is somewhere between the two, hence the three stars. Please don't get me wrong I do not think this is a bad film and I shall want to see it again, but that I cannot say that I `loved it' and that is great because I am pretty sure that is not the emotion the makers were aiming for.",1307750400,4,2241,4.268235294117647

4520603,5,B0051938XQ,"Valhalla Rising is one of those films that comes along rarely and disappears into obscurity before it truly gets noticed.  The movie is a brutal expression of beauty with existential questions.  One Eye is a tremendous character that is shown in all his base brutality, yet he has not lost his humanity.  He does what it takes to survive and protect those important to him.  The use of a small boy as a ""sidekick"" figure is a stroke of brilliance.  In a world of unmitigated cruelty, One Eye finds a place in his heart for a child.  Even though he doesn't utter a word, his emotional state is clear.  It is a mark of a truly gifted actor to be able to deliver such a vivid portrayal without speaking.  The plot of the film is ripe with legend and intrigue, and it is an overall satisfying romp.

The strongest point of the film is its incredible camera work, and the striking visuals would make the movie worth seeing if the film had nothing else to offer.  The camera angels are employed by a true artist, and the surreal and disturbing scenes grab the viewer by the throat and send waves of discomfort to the soul.  It is not that the movie is overtly oppressive; it is simply capable of delivering a feeling of ""creepiness"" and otherworldly flavor better than most films I have seen.  The fact that One Eye sees things with his one eye that others do not nods to ancient beliefs and gives credit to its literary predecessors.

The only negative aspect of the film, to me, is the chapters.  They seem to break the film up into acts in an unnecessary manner.  Honestly, the movie is so well crafted that the distinction of parts is unnecessary, and I found them somewhat distracting.  I understand the convention, but it feels as if the director is trying to hand hold the audience a bit.  Some of the imagery in certain segments will strike the viewer as odd and difficult to understand.  This film requires you to use your brain and have a basic to advanced understanding of symbolism to understand certain scenes.  In particular, the act entitled ""Hell,"" has some bizarre occurrences and requires some symbolic extrapolation to digest.  This segment portrays vice, filth, ritual, and madness with perfect clarity.  It is disturbing and disgusting in places.  Everything is dirty, gray and grimy.

The power of Valhalla Rising rests in its ability to suck the viewer into the rich visuals and complex plot devices it gives out in wondrous measure.  It is not a happy movie.  It is not for the lame of brain.  It is a beautiful piece of violent art that slips quietly into the nether regions of the barbarian heart and finds morality and hope inside.  It is a picture of the depraved, the fanatical, the insane, and is a vision of one man willing to do what he needs to do to cross the gates of life into the pages of legend.",1304294400,4,2827,4.52465483234714
4520604,4,B0051938XQ,"It's not often that I watch a movie where the protagonist never says a word. In fact the only sounds are those exhortations during fights-to-the-death wherein Mikkelsen's character is chained or bound to a large pole in a quagmire or those sustained during combat with weapons. One-Eye is a prisoner of a Viking-like band. By day and night, he is relegated to a barred prison cell lodged against an inhospitable rock wall against yet open to all the elements. A young boy takes care of his needs. Periodically, he is taken out by his captors to fight one or two opponents. He takes whatever punishment these men dish out, but One-Eye always vanquishes them in the end--even though he is handicapped by a tether around his neck. He is eventually sold to another. During his trek to a supposed new home, he breaks free and kills his captors, then joins a Christian Viking clan seeking to fight in the Crusades. On the voyage, they become becalmed in a fog that never lifts until they reach a land unknown to all of them but supposedly North America. Talk about a wrong turn. The survivors are forced to deal with the solitude of the new, unfamiliar land, natives they cannot communicate with yet who pick off members one at a time, the loneliness and isloation, and the fact that their leader is probably going mad.

The scenery is spare yet breathtaking, a testament to the cinematography of the Scottish highlands and mountains. Mikkelsen established a name for himself in Denmark. Here, he can convey volumes with just a look from his one good eye. He wrestles with his past, his warrior tendancies, and the friendship of a boy who has been with him since early in the movie. The child is probably the only friend One-Eye really has. Having only relied on himself for so long it seems difficult for One-Eye to accept the friendship of another or indeed the need to protect a weaker person. He seeks to balance that with his natural survivor tendancy. In the end, he is willing to sacrifice all that for another.

I'm not sure I liked this movie or not; I think so. It bears watching again. I gave it four stars largely because of Mikkelsen who gave a good turn in mainstream movies like ""Casino Royale"" and ""King Arthur."" He seems to be one of those enigmatic actors who will take on a difficult role (the cold and grime in ""Valhalla Rising"" are pervasive). There is no warmth in this movie. It is hard to create it when there is no dialogue from the lead actor, but good actors should be able to play their roles well without having to speak, which Mikkelsen does here.",1303257600,3,2571,4.574837310195227

The Review: ""Valhalla Rising"" successfully generates a most unnerving atmosphere with its creepy desolate scenery and harsh droning musical score.  Unfortunately, the strong imagery and music is the only thing this movie has going for it.  Thanks to director Nicolas Winding Refn's tedious pacing and frustrating editing, this visually intriguing film becomes an increasingly painful experience to even tolerate, let alone enjoy.  Featuring very little in the way of dialogue, character development, and action; the primitive narrative snails through its modest running time; leaving behind only a few head scratching spiritual metaphors for our trouble.  Save the distinct looking Mikkelsen who has nothing to do except stare out of his one good eye and a likable small boy, the rest of the cast are a faceless and forgettable lot.  There are also some distracting CGI animated chapter cards that kill the mood every few minutes, weak animated gore effects, and some goofy ""future vision"" that isn't elaborated upon.  Also, there's a lot of mud.",1300406400,4,1214,5.22680412371134

4520611,4,B0051938XQ,"""Valhalla Rising"" plays like a bizarre hybrid of Terrence Malick and Mel Gibson, it wants to tell a gritty tale of vikings and the Crusades while keeping a visually poetic, dreamlike tone. It's a hard task and director Nicolas Winding Refn almost pulls it off but never makes it to the finish line. When it comes to narrative the film is not a complete success, but it is worth watching for its textures. In this age of recycled commercialism, it is refreshing to see a director like Refn attempt something more original and different.

The story basically follows a one-eyed character played by Mads Mikkelsen who finds himself captured by local warlords. After escaping with a blonde boy as his companion, ""One Eyed"" bumps into a group of Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. One Eyed is recruited for the journey and after a trippy, myst-plagued journey by boat, the crusaders and One Eyed find themselves in a lush, forest land which we immediately discover is the then undiscovered America. What follwos is a descent into madness as indigenous inhabitants begin killing off members of the crusader group and others become drunk with fantasies of power and conquest.

Recently there has been a rise in sword and sandle movies with very bleached cinematography, cheesy dialogue and over the top gore, a perfect example is the recent ""Centurion."" With ""Valhalla Rising"" Refn keeps some of the bleached look and gore, but tones it down, preferring instead gorgeous, haunting vistas and patient, beautifully structured shots. The visuals alone make the film worth watching. There are grand, mysty European landscapes and the actors are framed in shots that look taken out of Frazetta paintings. The editing in this film is not frantic, like the films of Terrence Malick or David Gordon Green it tries to create a kind of hypnotic rhythm. You get the sense Refn wasn't trying to tell a story so much as set a mood, like music, and here the sound design is also crucial. The music by Peter Peter Schneifderman and Peter Kyed is atmospheric, it never quickens or pounds. Unlike the typical film in this genre this one also leaps into surrealism at times, mixing reality with stunning dream sequences that look like a Viking fantasy tinged with absinthe.

What keeps ""Valhalla Rising"" from being a great film is that Refn seems to have focused more on the images and tone than fleshing a story that was fully worthy of this technique. Malick, Kubrick and Green's work is noteworthy because they combine strong writing with their visual poetry. Here we get a lot of surface but little depth. For example the main character is never allowed to truly establish a strong identity, the fact that he's mute doesn't help much because the character vacuum created by that touch is never properly filled in. The dialogue is very sparse, which isn't the problem, the problem is that if Refn planned to have such little dialogue he should have at least given the characters better things to say when they do speak up. Instead we are treated to very geeky dialogue that never feels real, more like the kind of thing heavy metal fans used to scribble in their high school notebooks back in the 80s. What does save the characters is that they are well casted, and when Refn sticks to his quiet, beautifully-framed sections the actors have real presence, especially Mikkelsen who stays in the memory. But you do wish he would speak up, this character seems like the type a good actor would have a great time bringing to life.

So aside from the poor dialogue, ""Valhalla Rising"" is still a film that tries to be different in its structure and composition. Despite its flaws it does reach some impressive visual heights. Refn should be commended for not producing another 2-hour bloodbath. There is brutal violence in this film, but it doesn't dominate the entire running time and plays more like footnotes. What stays in the memory are the sights. Many directors don't bother to try and actually produce cinema these days, Refn at least seems to be truly trying to use the camera. ""Valhalla Rising"" shows us something new, and that's something you won't get from ""Battle: Los Angeles.""",1299974400,13,4169,4.826573426573426
4520612,4,B0051938XQ,"I say a 4.5 star on the meter. Stone arrows penetrating chainmail? I don't think so.
I was thoroughly engaged with the movie until the end. It was predictable as it had been given away. Imo, they landed somewhere around Newfoundland but the war clubs were not quite accurate nor was the depiction of the Natives who would've been Miqmac unless we're to assume they made it further south by the Abenaki, nor was the response proper and stone arrowheads penetrating chainmail was a mistake.

One thing I never assumed was that One-Eye was a mute. A chosen silence makes more sense to me for the character. If he was a mute and I missed that his tongue was cut out, it still doesn't detract from the movie.

A better ending would've been if he had fought with the natives with success and made us aware they were Abenaki and then turned back to them and turn himself over to them, been tied to a stake and tortured, enduring it in silence (reserved for only the most fierce enemies), and then burned alive which would also have given him a Viking funeral. Then a scene showing their respect and then the ending.

I realize this would've been more gory and upset some who have certain ideas about Native Americans, but rest assured it would've been both accurate and far more dramatic. I seldom make a comment like this, but I believe it would've been a better movie. The way it was done left an emptiness from something left undone.

That being said...worth owning? You bet! Worth seeing again, Heck yes to see what I missed which I don't doubt I did.",1299715200,3,1548,4.498220640569395

4520614,4,B0051938XQ,"There are movies that elicit a strong ""I love it"" or ""I hate it"" reaction. Valhalla Rising did neither. It left me bewildered, wondering what the purpose of this film was - which may very well be its purpose.

The story's main character is a man with only one eye, hence nicknamed One Eye by his caretaker, a young boy whose name, if he had one, I have forgotten. One Eye is some sort of gladiator. He looks different from his captors, who we learn are Scottish, and may be a Viking, but we never know for sure because he doesn't speak. The only thing we learn about him is that he is a killer who has never lost a fight.

After several years of captivity and slavery, One Eye finds something that helps him escape. Followed by his caretaker, who also serves as his ""interpreter"" of sorts (since One Eye doesn't speak, the boy mainly interprets his facial expressions - and makes up stuff as he goes along), he encounters a group of Scottish crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. We never find out exactly what motivates One Eye to join them. His actions seem guided by flashbacks (which we later find out are actually glimpses of the future) and in the end, there seems no point to them.

This is definitely an unusual film that sort of creeps up on you and keeps you watching because of its slow, breathtaking landscape shots (combined with a soundtrack that I found very disturbing at times) - but mostly because you want to see if anything is ever going to happen. And things do happen - just not the way you expect them to, which is what I liked about the movie. I was left wondering what this was all about, why the movie was titled Valhalla Rising and if it actually had anything to do with the conflict between Christians and pagans in 11th century northern Europe.",1298246400,2,1776,4.39209726443769

I must admit that I would have really  enjoyed this movie if I was either stoned on crack, or was recovering from a nervous breakdown. I  enjoy gritty , historic  films with realistic action scenes.  and I was hoping that this would have been in the vein of the 13th Warrior, or possibly the first Highlander movie. Alas this is not the case here. Although the sets, costumes, and props  look authentic , the story goes nowhere. After the main character gains his freedom and it is never clear when or how he became a captive in the first place, he embarks on a journey to the holy lands with a group of vikings. After getting lost in a fog ( probably the same fog that the director got lost in ) , they wind up in what looks like North America and start getting attacked by ( indians )? Between fighting among themselves, getting lost and dodging arrows that come out of nowhere it is a wonder that any of them make it to the promised land, or in this case the top of the mountain.  If this story  was supposed to be based on Viking legend of Erik the Red, essentially that a party of vikings landed at Flowers Cove, Newfoundland roughly 500 years before Colombus ""discovered"" America , then please let us in on it. There wasn't much dialogue in the movie. Maybe 50 lines or so. I always find it refreshing when a character mentions something that happened recently, within the context of the film . This gives the audience a point of reference as to when the story is taking place. Sadly that is not the case here. Not only do we have to guess WHEN  this is taking place but also  WHAT  they are trying to accomplish, after they land .I would have to give this one star out of five .

One eye, as he is refered to by the young boy who's job it is to feed him, is a slave, or rather a gladiator, who's job is only to kill every man or men put in front of him, so his master may profit from it. Eventualy one eye and the boy escape, and end up taking a voyage to the new land with christian vikings, but it isn't a pleasure cruise.

4520620,1,B0051938XQ,"If you were a fan of Colin Ferrel's ""New World,"" you may actually like this.  Starts off with a highland version of the Roman Colliseum held, not in a city, town or miniscule hamlet, but somewhere in the rugged Scots highlands.  People are waging on the combatants, a situation/venue that seems to have been going on for years.  Of course there are not so much as seats, or any type of shelter, all just hike to the remotes of Scotland to bet on the fights, sit on rocks and endure the severe highland weather.  ""IF"" you can make it past this, then you should have no trouble accepting that the main ""gladiator"" breaks free and joins a bunch of misguided Scots crusaders bent on sailing to the Holy Land. Of course you'll then also be able to accept that they leave with nothing (no chests, no PROVISIONS, no WATER, no OARS and... NO NAVIGATIONAL SKILLS).  So, the fact that they wind up floating slowly across the Atlantic and wind up in the New World (only losing three along the way) will be quite plausible.  (Hey, bet you'll also buy that other than a heavy fog and no wind, the weather was okay too; no storms, ice flows, serious cold weather, nothing!

I enjoyed this movie until the last five minutes. It had a well defined protagonist. It had an obvious revenge-plot line. It had a unique path for redemption and then the director dumps the whole movie into a lumpish ball.

I would categorize this as an anti-hero story: hero finds victim, hero saves victim, victim  leaves, hero dies in some obscure and unrelated manner.

4520622,5,B0051938XQ,"If you are interested in Kung Fu Flicks - with actors jumping twenty feet into the air - this film is definitely not for you.

This film is probably more historically accurate than most - with the possible exception of the movie based on the Gisla Sage(Gisli Sursson's Saga) - made into a 1981 Movie - tlaginn (1981)- and - which is also excellent.

For those of you truly interested in ""Viking Origins"" - I suggest that you get hold of William Morris' translation of The Icelandic Sagas - and - read those portions pertaining to Harald Fairhair or Harald Finehair, (c. 850 - c. 933)- he first king (872-930) of Norway - and - those first Christian Kings who followed - e.g. Haakon I, (c. 920-961), given the byname the Good, who was the third king of Norway and the youngest son of Harald Fairhair and Thora Mosterstang.[1]

But - enough of history - and - back to the movie.

We are at a time when Christianity is brutally eradicating all traces of traditional religions - with Christian Vikings erasing all trace of their Viking Brethren - who still choose to practice the traditional religions of their forefathers - burning homes and villages to the ground - and - slaughtering everyone in sight.

We are ""thrown"" into this world where a one-eyed warrior - a slave - kept alive only be his hate - is forced to fight to the death for his very survival. We follow this slave - now - become free - as he transcends the warrior - and - his hatred - and - makes the ultimate sacrifice - sacrificing himself so that his young companion might live.

We view this transcendence - in the shadow of the Christian Symbol of the cross - symbolized by the hilt of the viking sword.

Is it just accident that One-Eye does not carry a sword - but - rather an ax as his weapon - and - hence is not tied to this symbol of Christianity?  Is it just an accident that his enemies die with sword in hand - still tied to this symbol - while - he transcends his warrior spirit?

Ah - this is for you - the viewer to determine for yourselves.

This is really kind of a weird movie. It's set in one of the Norse countries during the middle ages. There is a lot of mud and blood and a lot of dark skies. Mikkelson plays a slave. It seems he's had several masters over the years and they use him to win money for them by fighting other slaves. He's the best. he beats/ kills all his opponents. By a fluke he finds an arrowhead. He uses it to kill his owners, win his freedom, hook up with some other guys to head off to the Crusades. Weird weather causes them to go off course and they end up in the New World instead. It's all down hill from there.

The first act is uncomfortable to watch. The people are brutes. The fights are viscious. You're always cold and dirty. There is no warmth or sunshine. The second act is a bit slow. They're stuck on a ship in waters with seemingly no current and a fog so heavy you can barely tell night from day. There are a lot of philosophical-religious discussion about God and life purpose and what have you. When they hit the new world in the third act things pick up again but, when it was all said and done, I'm not certain what the director/producers were getting at. It all seemed rather pointless.

This movie does have some very artful touches. First is the near total lack of dialogue. Little is spoken. The Mikkelson character, One Eye (because he only has one useful eye) does not utter one word. The music has a very spooky/ethereal feel to it. In certain ways, this is like watching Herzog's 'Aguirre the Wrath of God.' When One Eye sees himself in visions, he's colored blood red and often pointing toward something unseen. Lots of stuff like that.

This is not for the casual movie goer. It demands a lot of attention (and some patience) to make it through its rather trim 93 minutes. If you're more a fan of the middle of the road sort of flick then stay away. If the rare bird is more your poison then sit down to this meal.",1295827200,4,2085,4.231155778894473

4520628,5,B0051938XQ,"Ok, don't read this review unless you have already seen `Valhalla Rising'. Because a lot of people still don't seem to get it, here's a capsule explanation of exactly what happens in the film, from someone who examines evidence of crimes and from that puts together suspects' MOs, serial killer methodologies, etc:

A mute slave, One Eye, is forced by his captors to fight. One day, he finds an old arrowhead by submerging himself in a waterpool located on some mountain upland, after having a dream about the event. Later, One Eye uses the arrowhead to free himself and kill his captors. From this, his mind forms an abstract construct about submersion in water giving him the key that unlocks his freedom. An unnamed slave boy accompanies the newly freed One Eye, and they encounter a group of Christian Scots-Gaelic warriors who are on their way to the Crusades. One Eye and the boy board the Christians' ship, and with them sail away into a dense sea fog that does not lift until they find their ship has somehow left the sea and floated inland along the course of an unnamed river. Their location is uncertain and soon becomes a point of contention among the travelers.

In this unfamiliar land, One Eye and his companions encounter some signs of human habitation: raised wooden biers holding decayed corpses and tribal religious paraphernalia stand in a lightly wooded area. Pay attention here, and you can see near this location a waterpool or small pond with the trunk of a dead, sun-bleached tree rising out of the water, or from the shore. There is a scene where the group is approaching the biers, and the waterpool/tree is there between them and the biers; another waterpool/dead tree tableau can be seen briefly for a moment behind and to the right of the leader of the Christian warriors. One Eye somehow makes the connection that these waterpool/dead tree tableaus have spiritual significance to the land's native inhabitants, else they wouldn't have chosen to honor their dead in that place.

Later, the leader of the Christian warriors, who was allowed to travel through the unnamed land unmolested up until that point, is shot dead with arrows while standing waist-deep in a small pond. Note: to his left stands a dead, sun-bleached tree rising out of the water. Was the warrior-leader shot for violating the native inhabitants' ""holy ground"" by standing in the pond?

Recall the earlier scene in which all of the characters drink some unnamed psychoactive liquor from a carved wooden bottle, and then all proceed to succumb to various kinds of drug-induced mania and/or religious ecstasy on the shores of a still lagoon. After drinking, One Eye glances over his shoulder toward a distant rocky promontory, where the native inhabitants are presumed to be hiding and watching; One Eye does this to let them know he's aware they are there.

Then, standing apart from the maddened, drug-dazed crowd, One Eye constructs a column-like structure of stones on a small islet near the shores of the lagoon. Note that when he begins this task, One Eye sets the first stone atop the stump of a dead tree. He is sending the watching tribesmen the message that he understands their religion: he knows what their holy places are, where spirits are presumed to dwell. And so One Eye himself constructs a new ""holy place.""

At the end of the film, before One Eye is beaten to death, he envisions himself (his spirit?) walking into the waters of that lagoon where he built the stone column; then he (or his spirit) is submerged, the head disappearing under the water's surface, like he did near the beginning of the film when he found the arrowhead that eventually aided him in freeing himself. Only this time, the audience is supposed to surmise that the freedom One Eye seeks (and gets, through the death of his physical body) is spiritual freedom, as opposed to his physical freedom earlier.

Every other one star review you may have read about this is true. It.is.terrible
Now,I'm not an angry chappy by any means, I listen to jack johnson and drink the occasional cup of green tea but this film made me question the consequences of killing my own brother for renting it. Now, if I were so inclined to dispatch of my brother it would have only been deemed fitting if I did it VALHALLA STYLE!!! This would involve not talking to him for days,staring at him for hours then moving on to staring at rocks and then by killing myself!!!
Oh yes!!This 'warrior' gifted with 'supernatural strength' decides to allow the last of the mohicans to beat him to a bloody pulp. This is my take on the plot: Le Chiffre didn't actually die in Casino Royale, instead he escaped and fled to Scotland,now penniless and too shy to talk to anybody he has to re-enact old battles to afford his eye medication as he now has a really nasty infection. Of course every cloud has a silver lining and in this case it is that now every aspiring director can watch this movie knowing that if he includes just one boob or more than 30 words he will have made a better film than this.",1295222400,5,1264,4.382978723404255

It starts out with the protagonist (?) fighting for the amusement of his warlord captors and quickly evolves. He escapes and then joins a band of Christian vikings on their way to fight in the Crusades, they become lost at sea and end up stranded on a unknown island.  At this point the movie goes into strange territory.  The individuals of the party become separated and go on different spirit journeys which leaves only a few surviving.

The only issues I take with the movie are its timeline. Many sites say the setting is in 1000 A.D. Scotland. The Christian Scottish ""Vikings"" (ignoring the fact that by the time of the First Crusade, 1096-1099, the entirety of the British Isles were Christian, not Heathen), are going to the Holy Land of Jerusalem, and make remarks of their fathers going there and returning to tell of its beauty.

4520646,1,B0051938XQ,"I can honestly say that this is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life. There is no story, no character development, no nothing. Now to be fair I have never been one for artistic movies, I see a film to be entertained, so perhaps people that like artsy movies will like this. I can however only describe what I think of this film, and to me this is nothing but a one and a half hour long s*** fest, it might be the worst movie I have seen in my life.

Valhalla Rising is about a mysterious mute slave who is being used for gladiator style fights. He also seam to have the ability to predict the future through his dreams. Anyway he soon escapes and wanders aimlessly around together with another slave, a young boy who escaped with him. The pair team up with a group of Christians with more zeal than sense of direction. The Christians is looking for the holy land to join the crusade but end up in America instead.

Now you might be thinking, this might make an excellent story, an escaped warrior slave who in addition is psychic and who may or may not come from Hel, a band of zealous crusaders, the myth that the Vikings discovered America before Columbus did. Well yes that could be great, but nothing happens, there is hardly any dialog, the characters are either killing one another of staring off into nothing, or tripping out on hallucinogens and dreaming that they are killing one another or having future visions where they are...you guessed it, killing one another. There is no reason, no storyline nothing.

What this movie reminds me of is the 1970's acid movies, there are strange camera angels, crazy colors, trippy music, nonsensical scenes. If I am to compare it to anything it would be Vampyros Lesbos, nonsensical, artsy, trippy and completely unwatchable, the only difference is that here you have psychic Vikings instead of lesbian vampires.

I do have to give the movie credit on one point, there are some beautiful nature shots in there. Other than that, like another reviewer said if what you are looking for is a poem or a painting in movie format then this movie might be for you. But if you want anything resembling a plot then shun this movie as you will be disappointed.",1290211200,21,2211,4.52

Do you actually know what crusaders on their crusade for the holy land looked like? Buy a history book!

Wanna see crap? Watch this movie! It's like watching a painting. The main character doesn't speak throughout the movie, but only stares around him or at his fellow companions. Now, THAT'S acting. There's no plot, hardly any dialogues (and the ones you hear are amazingly stupid). There is no background story, no character development. The acting is... well.. there is no acting at all. A bunch of people walk, then stop to stare in all directions, walk again, stare again, utter stupid dialogues, walk again, stare again. That's the entire story.

The plot is rather simple, dialog is sparse, fights are brutal, and there is a rather strange interlude towards the end as the men starve. I enjoyed the film, but thought it was a little too indulgent in its pacing. The story is not all that engrossing, but rather what this movie offers and delivers on is providing a sense and feel of a raw and brutal viking age. Most plot points are unexplained and character action comes off as rather unmotivated, or with the simple metaphor that man is animal. It would seem instead that the direction focuses the viewer's attention on the beautiful and at times extremely violent aesthetic of raw nature. It should be mentioned that the second half of the film has a very surreal quality, even without considering One-eye's premonitions, and this is most definitely intentional as the chapter titles reveal that their voyage has become a descent into hell/the underworld (aka The New World). Thus somewhere along the way, the ship is lost in a haze from which the crew never returns.

The story was interesting. I like to think and feel when watching a good movie and I did. This was One Eye's story. He is finally freed from slavery and sets out on a new life to a new world. You are thinking his future has to be better than his past. The extreme violent lifestyle he endured as a slave who had to fight for the profit and entertainment of his captors has not killed his humanity as you see in his relationship with the young boy. He can still see right from wrong. But violence was a necessity to survive. I would have preferred a different ending but at least it wasn't predictable.

4520650,4,B0051938XQ,"A peculiar though fascinating art house excursion, the 2009 film ""Valhalla Rising"" is a symbolic viking adventure about the discovery of the new world. To understand this film's aura, it should be noted it makes Terrence Malick's similarly-themed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B000ESSUL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>&nbsp;feel like a summer blockbuster romp.

There is nothing pleasant about Refn's nightmarish world (filmed on location in Scotland) where men wear sodden rags, tromp through mud and wage wet battles to the death. An oppressive fog covers all, and scarred men stare quietly into space desperately searching for definition. Small campfires provide little warmth, and what few women are seen are naked and chained together as slaves. Harsh does not begin to scratch the surface of Refn's haunting imagery (aided by Morten Sborg's brilliant cinematography and a fascinating musical score of Peter Kyed and Peter Peter). Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen displays unique presence as a one-eyed viking, appropriately named One Eye. He's evidently a captive, residing in a wooden cage and carefully fed like a lion by the orphaned blond boy Are (Maarten Stevenson). On a regular basis, he's dragged from his prison, chained to a post and forced to fight to the death versus combatants while weary warlords sit nearby and wager the outcome. There are no cheers for his victories, punctuated by the sounds of crushed skulls and broken bones.

One Eye eventually kills his captors and, with the boy gingerly trailing, silently travels cross country where they encounter a meager band of warriors who have converted to Christianity. They are preparing for a Crusade to Jerusalem, and reluctantly recruit One Eye, whose warrior legend precedes him. Soon, trapped on a meager long ship within a mysterious mist, they become hopelessly lost and depressed. The mists finally part, and before them is the ominous but sunny, tree-covered land of the new world. Quietly hiking through tall grasses, they encounter signs of Native Americans, including burial scaffolds and ghost-like arrows thumping into the bodies of unlucky comrades. These desperate vikings plant a tall, wooden cross in the virgin soil, utterly convinced they've arrived in Hell. Through it all, One Eye, with his boy sidekick in tow, silently leads the way through this mysterious world, disturbing even to him.

""Valhalla Rising"" includes multiple dream sequences drenched in red, long continuous shots of wind-blown landscapes and ultimately, scenes of men sitting on rocks for minutes at a time staring into the void of quiet space. These are not spirited warriors by any stretch of the imagination, but terrified souls lost within the tides of worlds far more powerful than their swords. ""Valhalla Rising"" is a vision quest gone mad, completely lacking in the romantic conventions one expects from this period.

I have always respected Anger's purposefully obscure films, where story is sacrificed for experimental, dream-like imagery. This is the true promised land of Refin's brutal journey. With a larger budget, he's taken Anger a step further, though fueled by equally potent doses of LSD. The minimum amount of dialog, usually raising more questions than answering, further carves a moody land of mystery and death.

The movie definitely LOOKS and SOUNDS awesome with an ambient score reminiscent of Agalloch, but without the heavy riffing or manic drumming. Its an artsy non-blockbuster with a tone akin to ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" (1972) and ""Black Robe"" (1991). Apocalypto (2006) is a good modern comparison, although the story isn't as compelling as Black Robe or Apocalypto. It has elements of Apocalypse Now (1979) but the thin story just isn't anywhere near as fascinating. Still, its okay.

There are some weak points, like the Viking chief saying ""It's a river"" when this would've been obvious about an hour earlier when the mist first cleared (aduh). I'm sure the director would chalk it up to artistic license. Another issue is that the film is slow with not enough events to justify its runtime. As such, we get needlessly drawn-out scenes like the discovery of fresh water (which was obvious from the get-go of the sequence). The whole episode couldve been done in a third of the time given.

GRADE: B

INTERPRETATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve seen the movie).

The silent One-Eye is the incarnation of Odin. He is invincible and holds the power to see the future. He disdains the Christian Vikings whove usurped his influence over his people. He tests many in battle to see if they're worthy, but finds none. Nevertheless, he sullenly sees his people off to their new (holy) land, America, where Scandinavians were the third most numerous immigrants. The Boy is a type of Thor, his son, who will sort of replace him in America once the grim god ironically sacrifices himself  la Jesus Christ.",1525564800,,2056,4.857142857142857

8452426,1,B0051938XQ,Not good. Total disappointment  since seen this actor in other movies.  No words are spoken just body language.  Do not recommend.,1520812800,,130,5.095238095238095
