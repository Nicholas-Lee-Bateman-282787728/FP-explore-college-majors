1343671,4,B00004RFSC,"The quality of this video is superior including filming, costume, locations, and music.  This workout is an easy start for flexability and breaks down the movements for the novice. The only area remiss would be not  enough whole body shots in order to get complete view of movements. Go  ahead and get this video and GET STARTED!",963273600,5,329,4.7368421052631575
1343672,3,B00004RFSC,"I loved the set and the beautiful costumes ,however the instruction and demonstration leave a little to be desired. On the whole it is not really a bad video. It is beautifully lite and well photographed but I've seen  better belly dancers at the Ren fairs. The camera man seems fascinated with  Dolphinas face when he should have focused on her hips or foot work. As for  instruction it is lacking the verbal element necessary for a novice to  break down the movements. I have some experience at bellydancing and wasn't  tooooo in lost . However, a friend who had never bellydanced was completly  in the dark. For a true instruction tape get Neenea and Veenas set. It is  super,esp. basic moves!",961632000,7,696,4.655737704918033
1343673,5,B00004RFSC,This is the first workout tape that I have used more than one time. I use it daily! I like  that there are not other poeple in the video. It gives me a sense of privacy and I don't have to judge myself against so called  beginners that are often present in a lot of dance type workout tapes. I  found the tape demanding yet I can do it. This type of workout is great for  flexibility and there is enough in it to prevent boredom.,961372800,10,429,3.953488372093023
1343674,4,B00004RFSC,"I love to belly dance and have been taking some classes. I liked the video. But some parts could be improved. For example, her face was being filmed while doing hip circles. So, I couldn't see what she was exactly  seeing. Her whole should have been filmed, so that we can see whats going  on. I thought i had good flexibility till i tried this. Some of the moves  were pretty hard at the beginning but after sometime u can do it too. The  music could have been better. It made me feel kinda sleepy. I'm not saying  something like FatBoy SLim should be played. I think a more upbeat,  traditional middle eastern music should be played. Otherwise, the workout  was pretty good, and it does make u feel like a goddess.",959385600,4,716,4.378787878787879
1343675,4,B00004RFSC,"This was the third bellydance video I've tried and really enjoyed it.  There were some parts that could have been better. For example, at times, the camera focused on her face when she was doing moves with the hips.  I  needed to see exactly how the move was being done but had to improvise and  hope I was doing it right.  Yes, she is very beautiful but it would have  been better to watch the entire move.  Also, some moves were only done once  or in one set as soon as I was getting it.  It was a little inconvenient to  stop the tape and practice.  Other than that, it is a great workout which  is fun. The negatives don't detract too much from the overall tape.  I look  forward to doing the workout each day and do feel I get better each time I  do it.  I even work up a sweat!  Overall, I do recommend this tape.  It's a  new and different way to move each day!",955238400,17,868,4.029585798816568
1343676,5,B00004RFSC,"I'm really into Yoga and I thought I was very flexible and co-ordinated until I tried this video.  It is very challenging and I was glad I was doing the video by myself. After doing the video a couple of times, it got  easier. I feel like it has helped my flexibilty and yoga.",954892800,7,276,4.092592592592593
1343677,3,B00004RFSC,"This is my first bellydance video, so I have nothing to compare it to, really. However I do have a few comments:
 Dolphina is an accomplished dancer and presents the workout beautifully but her voice detracts from the  material in my way of thinking. She sounds rather..uh.. flakey, I guess you  could say. Her voice nearly put me to sleep while I was viewing the video  before practicing it. It makes it that much harder to concentrate when  trying to follow her instructions
 The bits of metaphysical knowledge  thrown in around the instructions make one wonder why the trouble was taken  to mention them in the first place. The way chakras and Kundalini are  mentioned, it makes one wonder if they were just added to further the  ""Goddess"" aspect of the video or if the writers thought they were  giving us some substantial information.
 The special effects are just  that- special effects which add NOTHING to the presentation and are  annoying at times.
 The ""routine"" at the end is about 45  seconds long, nothing to write home about. One may have expected that after  all of the movements presented that it would be longer.
 I think the  Goddess Workout was so named to attract Pagans and and people exploring the  Goddess in general.
 There has to be a better bellydance video out  there.",954028800,23,1296,4.7174887892376685
1343678,5,B00004RFSC,"The Goddess Introduction to Bellydance workout tones and shapes, but is not a strenuous aerobic challenge. If you've conquered the Introduction and want to challenge yourself,  the Warrior Goddess workout will do that. There are whole new levels of burn for your muscles, but if you start slowly and keep at it, you will find it rewarding. If moves are difficult at first, follow Dolphina's advice and ""just shake something."" Your body will figure things out eventually. I imagine people who are already in outstanding shape but are seeking new moves will be challenged by the choreography.

For those who find visual interest important in workouts (after all, you're watching it on a nearly daily basis), this is every bit as lovely as the Introduction. Unlike the Introduction, Dolphina does not change costumes between every section, wearing a simple workout outfit. The location is serene and simple, with Dolphina's workout space surrounded by a reflecting pool and pale walls that reflect the water. She does wear more traditional belly dance costumes for the routine and the cool down.

Great choreography, great commentary, great setting. I highly recommend this DVD.",1169510400,,1175,5.2063492063492065
1343679,4,B00004RFSC,"Dolphina's Warrior Goddess workout is both cheesy and surprisingly inspirational. It's clear that Dolphina is an experienced bellydancer, but she's very... L.A., in the most stereotypical sense of the word. It may feel cheesy at first when she's calling you a ""goddess"" and ""amazing"" - but it becomes surprisingly inspirational, especially for those of us who have body image issues (which may be most of us women). I found the moves in this workout to be more about freeing the body and helping you to feel, well, like a goddess in your own skin, rather than about working yourself to exhaustion.

Those who are total beginners to bellydancing may find it useful to begin with Dolphina's beginner video before moving to this one. As someone with some bellydancing experience, I found that this video was alternately wonderful and frustrating. She mostly uses her own names for moves, rather than the traditional ones, and as workouts go, she often focuses only on one side without working the other - when I do this video, I find myself having to pause it while I work the other side.

That all being said, you will get out of this workout what you put into it. If you don't really focus on isolation and tight muscle movement, you won't reap the benefits. Bellydancing, after all, isn't about shaking your body carelessly - it is about carefully constructed movement using fiercely conditioned muscles fired in isolation. So, if you really focus and work at using your muscles as she tells you to, you will feel the workout, and depending on your level of fitness, break a decent sweat by the end of it. If you don't, you will get almost nothing out of it.

Experienced bellydancers and fitness freaks may find this video a little (or a lot) off-putting. I'd recommend it more for those who are interested in bellydancing, but may have not taken very many classes, and really just like the idea of bellydancing as a way of... well, embracing their inner goddess. If you can get past Dolphina's Valley Girl voice, you might just find yourself inspired to treat your body more like the temple it is.",1164412800,3,2099,4.745205479452054
1343680,3,B00004RFSC,"I used these videos to workout with bellydance ,I shows some great moves and how to do them , however it dosent show much technic , and never shows footwork. For the absolute beginner I would recommend The Sensual Art of Bellydance, because it shows correct posture , footwork ,and technic. With Dolphina the carmera is constantly zooming to her face, and you can hardly see what she is doing with her legs and feet even when the camera shows her full body view ,because of all her vails, skirts and garb. However if you have alittle experience with bellydance then it is a nice tape to practice isolations with.",1157587200,,612,4.572727272727272
1343681,5,B00004RFSC,"This is a great beginners workout.  It teaches you all the basic movements of a traditional dance.  It's EXTREMELY relaxing and not to strenuous but if you do it a few times I week you'll notice a waistline start to develop as well as some abs strength.  Great workout, great technique.  Dolphina talks throughtout and is encouraging and breaks down the movements so they are easy to execute.  She also give little tidbits of info on history and sort so you don't get bored.  The Warrior Goddess (second tape) is an add on and you need some background in belly dance before going to it, but it's a great workout too and it takes it up a step.",1156982400,,642,4.398305084745763
1343682,4,B00004RFSC,"First of all, I think the best bellydance workout is ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"". It's so brilliantly organized that both total novices and advanced students can enjoy it.

Dolphina's workout is exclusively for the advanced. Her focus is combining isolations with steps and turns. She also makes you isolate while gradually kneeling (both knees/a single knee). There are some easier moves here, like hip drops. But most of Dolphina's exercises are hard. To make it even harder to follow, this video has some flaws:

- Some of the moves Dolphina doesn't break down well or doesn't break down at all.
- She sometimes picks up speed too soon into an exercise.
- A few times she forgets to reverse the direction or practice a move on the other side.

- I wish some exercises were longer. I think it could have been done at the expense of the ""warm up"" and ""cool down"" - the sections that I find boring and needless, as this workout is difficult ONLY in terms of coordination, not in terms of strength or flexibility.

- Dolphina's technique: her arm positions and movements are unpolished, as well as some of her chest movements. This is easy to ignore during the exercises, as they are mostly about hips, and her hipwork is beautiful. But it makes it impossible to enjoy her routine at the end. Actually many of her moves look awkward during that routine. Also, her demonstration of camels combined with steps is somewhat sloppy, and in one of those exercises she eventually loses her camels altogether.

- Sometimes the camera zooms out ridiculously far. I guess the point was to show off the set, but the set only ended up looking more artificial. And Dolphina becomes really hard to see. (However, whenever the focus is back to normal, the background also gets nice: just slightly drifting clouds... neat and refreshing).

- Although the music is adorable, it's very obscured by talking. Dolphina's voice was recorded at a much higher volume than the music. Moreover, some of that talking is totally needless, like counting or cheesy encouragements (""You are a goddess""; ""your hips are your weapon"").

However, all those imperfections seem minor to me... I've seen *really* horribly constructed, absolutely unusable videos (e.g. ""Precision motion workout"" by Suzanna Del Vecchio; see also my 1-star reviews). Compared to them Dolphina's workout is a breath of fresh air. Her presence is actually wonderful. She is kind of playful (sometimes a bit silly, but it's part of her charm). The overall atmosphere is nice and keeps me coming back.",1156636800,5,2545,4.890951276102088
1343683,5,B00004RFSC,"I also disagree with most of the reviews written here...I think this DVD is an awesome workout, easy to follow even for a first-timer and very well broken down.  My sister is a semi-pro Bellydancer in CT and got these for me because there are no live classes in South Carolina (yet).

After doing this tape, my muscles are tired (and I have been lifting and working out for 12 years), I am sweating a little (which is alot for me) and I feel wonderful, sexy and powerful - full of self-esteem, feeling just like the goddess that Dolphina says I'll feel like in the video!

I love it, and reccomend the Godess Workout to anyone who wants to feel that way, and wants a well produced, interst-holding, motivating video to accomplish it.  i will try the rest of Dolphina's DVDs based on this one alone.

1343684,2,B00004RFSC,"I could barely work my way through this video once.  I have been belly dancing off and on for two years, so many of the moves were familiar to me.  I bought this with the expectation that I would be able to practice and enhance my belly dancing while getting in shape at the same time.  This video was not helpful as a fitness program - I did not feel as though I had worked out at all.  Also many of the moves favored one side of the other, giving an uneven practice and learning.  I also thought that several techniques were not adequately explained or showed, and was therefore hard to follow, even with my prior belly dance knowledge.

Overall, I was disappointed.  I did, however, enjoy the opening goddess salutation, and felt well-stretched and enlivened after that.",1138406400,13,773,4.517985611510792
1343685,5,B00004RFSC,"WOW... I really disagree with these other reviews!  This is an excellent tape for beginners.  I began doing this tape while I was living in a small Ct. town, and live classes were not an option. At first, I was unable to complete the tape without taking breaks, and my arms hurt like heck afterwards!  When I finally moved back to the city and took my first bellydance class, (Shoutout to Sahara Dance in Washington DC!), I found the moves very easy to master.

  This tape is fabulously produced. Dolphina dances on a beautiful outdoor set. The workout is divided into sections according to body part/movement: arms, hips, shimmies, and so on.  Dolphina changes her outfit and location for each section. I really appreciated this-- after all, how long can you stare at one girl in a bland studio without getting bored? Dolphina's outfits are gorgeous, but not flashy. Furthermore, unlike Neena and Veena, Dolphina narrates as she moves-- there is no creepy voice coming from above.

  This video is complex enough to be challenging to a beginner, but also basic enough to allow the novice dancer to feel successful. I heartily recommend it!",1135641600,3,1141,4.835051546391752
1343686,3,B00004RFSC,"Dolphina's instruction was quite good and she sets a good pace, as well as being a good dancer.  However, the filming was terrible; it was often impossible to see her do the step she was teaching!  If I were not an experienced bellydancer, I would have been completely unable to follow the steps.",1134691200,8,296,4.566037735849057
1343687,4,B00004RFSC,"This video picks up after the Introduction to Bellydance video.  I think it is much better.  The camera work is better (not perfect though), Dolphina took out her hideous hair weave, dropped the false sexuality and speaks to the viewer like we're a familiar friend.

In this video, like in her other videos we start with a warm up, move on to the technique sections (divided into sections for the upper and lower body), practice a short routine and then end with a cool down.  From the beginning of the workout to the end, it's about 40-45 minutes.

Dolphina has some difficulties with keeping time.  She sometimes counts unevenly.

As in the the other videos, the scenery and outfits are really beautiful to see.

Even after many months of owning this video, it still presents a challenge.  It is also fun because after a few tries, you can feel that you are really getting the hang of the moves.  You can feel that you are doing something beautiful with your body.

I recommend this video for advanced beginners, who are no longer challenged by Veena and Neena's beginner's workout videos.",1126483200,8,1091,4.689473684210526
1343688,5,B00004RFSC,"Though I have all of Dolphina's workout video's, Warrior Goddess is my favorite.  It's a great workout video, that encorporates a lot of her introduction to belly dance moves.  This DVD targets your heart rate, and burns fat.  Though I am not too fond of her routine in the end, her moves are excellent for your own personal choreography.  I love the setting, and the quality of the production is excellent.  I love her tone of voice, and her fluidity. My favorite are her Camels. Great Job!!",1126224000,4,492,4.609195402298851
1343689,4,B00004RFSC,awesome nice workout and if you keep up with it nice tummy when your done,1124668800,,73,3.933333333333333
1343690,2,B00004RFSC,"I bought this DVD and the advanced DVD at the same time.  I have a policy of watching any instructional excercise video before actually doing them, to be sure that the movements are 'do-able' and visually understandable.  A reasonable practice, I think.

This video is pretty and if you like watching dancers, it's fine for that.

However, I agree with those who have said this is not an instructional tape that a person who has never bellydanced before will be able to use effectively.  The fact that the camera does not focus on moves when they are being performed and discribed was the biggest problem I have had with it.  For someone who has not been able to enroll in a class in her area, these videos will not be helpful to instruct a newbie at all.  Sorry, Dolphina.

For someone who is completely new to bellydance, this is frustrating.  The movements aren't well described, done slow enough or even filmed before the instruction is moving to a new movement or a routine that is hard to follow.

Unfortunately, the last time I tried to use this DVD, I got so frustrated I shut it off in the middle.",1123459200,4,1106,4.5125628140703515
1343691,4,B00004RFSC,"Despite so much criticism of Dolphina's videos, I enjoyed her Goddess Workout.

Dolphina's technique is not precise, she doesn't finish her movements, her transitions are blurry and sometimes random. However, if you are already familiar with the vocabulary of bellydance, it works.

""Warrior Goddess"" is an exercise program, not instruction. If you think of it as a fitness class where you casually follow the instructor, and you know all the moves, this video is fun! Yes, the camera occasionally focuses on the wrong body parts, but, again, if you have experience studying bellydance, you know what Dolphina is doing- her dance vocabulary is simple and doesn't require a lot of effort to figure out.  I love the sun-lit California swimming pool and blue sky, Dolphina is dancing on a white ""island"" in the middle of the pool. I like the colors, Dolphina's outfits, and I like that she is very comfortable in front of the camera  and that she talks. Unlike some other video bellydance instructors, Dolphina doesn't look tense or lost, she doesn't make ""sexy"" or ""sultry"" faces. Her casual easy attitude makes me feel relaxed. I don't care for the ""every woman is a goddess"" motivational talk, but I don't care for chakras and mudras either - even though I do yoga.  If you can digest yogic fantasies, you won't mind Dolphina's stuff, it's mild.",1117670400,6,1345,4.907488986784141
1343692,1,B00004RFSC,"I was really sad I wasted money on this work out.  Not only did Dolphina have poor form, but her comments were incredible annoying.  I may do this video again.. on mute.",1108512000,3,169,4.25
1343693,2,B00004RFSC,"As per other reviewers, the DVD focuses too much on her face/head/upper torso so that you worry about leg and arm/hand position. None of the foot or hand movements are explained. She is soothing and it is nice that she narrates herself. I did not break a sweat. It was not dancing or working out. More like yoga. The routine at the end was impossible. She did not go through the movements she would use or choreography and all you see is the middle of her body and head while you guess what she is doing and what her arms and legs are doing off-camera. I sort of dread the other three tapes in the set.",1104969600,7,602,4.198275862068965
1343694,3,B00004RFSC,"Mostly, my low review comes from not being huge fan of the ""arabesque"" move.  I was disappointed that it was relied on so heavily for this video.  I've always preferred layering moves(think drum solo focus on belly/hips) to travelling steps.  I would have preferred if she had used more layering moves.  Theres a shimmy section (which gets you're heart rate up for a few mintues), and a hip section and an abs section (which are okay), but then a lot of travelling steps.  If you are another dancer who prefers layering over travelling steps, don't get this video.

Do to the lack of layering (sorry, bitter) you don't get a great workout.

Also,I don't like the way it is broken up into sections: can't we mix it up!!",1100995200,9,718,4.5625
1343695,2,B00004RFSC,"If only I had read the reviews before buying this! I have been using Veena and Neena's bellydance workouts for quite some time, and when I found a set of three DVDs from Dolphina's Goddess Workout, I thought it'd be nice to try something different. Boy, was I wrong! I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate, and I still had a lot of trouble keeping up with the ""Intro"". I was particularly frustrated when, several times, Dolphina started ""teaching"" a hip/leg/foot motion, and for most of the time she was doing it, she was only visible from the hips up! Maybe someone on Ebay will want this set.",1100563200,4,603,4.644859813084112
1343696,1,B00004RFSC,"Although some reviewers are able to enhance their previous experience in belly-dancing or general dancing, I think for that very reason, this DVD falls short of its promise of ""Intro to Bellydancing"".

It is obviously poorly produced with that goal in mind, with camera shots, sets and costumes more focused on the superficial appeal of the video than the meat of the workout.  These shots continually miss her full body and her footwork which leads to confusion about weight distribution, frame and steps and then can quicky degenerate into injury and frustration.

While Dolphina herself may be a belly dancing phenome, she desperately needs to align herself with a production crew that is more mindful of the mechanics and presentation of her workout.  This video is not useful for beginners.",1099872000,4,795,5.092307692307692
1343697,1,B00004RFSC,"This is horrendous! If I wanted to see Dolphina, I would have bought a performance tape. The camera mostly just shows her face instead of the dance movements she's supposedly teaching you. As she goes through a fairly complicated combination of shimmies, circles, lifts and drops, THE CAMERA IS ENTIRELY ON HER FACE. This is useless for instruction. During the shimmy segment, she wears a long skirt that covers her legs. While that's fine for performance to preserve the mystery of how the dancer is moving like that, for an instructional tape, the viewer wants to see that the movement comes from the knees. I am so sorry I bought this, I wish I could return something just for being horrible.",1096416000,11,695,4.75206611570248
1343698,5,B00004RFSC,"Reading all those terrible, negative reviews of this most elegant video only further demonstrates my belief that most people are jealous, humorless,  fault-finding jerks.  I agree that it would have been much better to show more angles, and more full body shots, and the shimmy segment was not at all instructional.  This may not be the best tape for someone just starting on this delightful journey into the challenging world of bellydance, however, I would like to say that I have only been engaging in the art for a little while, and I have found this video to be very helpful to me.  I have seen quite a bit of improvement in my technique and style.  I have taken one five week workshop and two small lessons, and before that my first experience with bellydance was the Veena & Neena Slim Down workout. Then I watched the two tape Magical Motion set with Atea.  I later purchased a few

of the other Veena & Neena workout tapes and then the Goddess Workout.  Before bellydance I have studied tap, jazz and have taught ballroom, so I have always been acquainted with dance.

My advice: Watch Veena & Neena and Atea's tapes first.  You'll get a better sense of what you're supposed to do and later you'll have more fun with Dolphina.  She is beautiful, sexy, fun to watch.  I like this bellydance tape best of all because it is so inspiring.  The mood and settings have a great effect on me.  I feel less stressed and stronger after this exotic workout.  I also appreciate her appearance.  I get so disgusted by these overdone, painted up cabaret dancers you see most of the time.  Some of them dance so offensively that I shut off their dance routine (such as Atlantis on Atea`s tapes).

Her costumes are simply beautiful, refreshing, tasteful.  I enjoy the many and varied costume changes.  I think it is energizing to have the change in sets and costumes and lighting.  It's a fairly long workout, and it's nice to have the change in pace.  Some tapes I just find very dull, like the Rania tapes.  Not that they're bad workouts.

The music is very relaxing. Lovely music, and I intend to buy the soundtrack to it.  Another thing I appreciate is the fact that she talks directly to the viewer, displaying how she has so assimilated the art of what she's doing on the physical end that she is able to communicate without the need of a voice over.

Dolphina, by the way, IS a true belly dancer, unlike one person incorrectly stated.  She has been doing bellydance since the age of four, so if some of these reviewers have a tougher time starting out so much older, please don't blame Dolphina.

I highly recommend this tape for a good workout, great inspiration, and a wonderful time! I will surely buy her other tapes and hope she films more.",1095120000,3,2745,4.546938775510204
1343699,3,B00004RFSC,I found the moves hard to follow and I took classes before. She shows the moves at a fast pace. Her technique is beautiful it makes you want to learn more so you can look as sexy as she does. I don't know if I'll buy the instructional dvd due to the bad reviews. it increased my heartrate a little so it's good for a low cardio workout.,1085529600,4,336,3.9558823529411766

I also own her introduction video but I found it boring and slow. This one is perfect for me because I feel challenged when I can't do a move perfectly.  It makes me want to do it everyday just to see if I can master it! It also helps me to realize that I still have abs and that I can still tone them even though I can't see them anymore!",1080777600,3,592,3.8524590163934427

If it wasn't for the fact that I have some classroom experience, I would've had no clue what was going on at all.  She gave very little instruction about arm positioning during hip moves and often, she would describe a hip movement to perform, yet never actually SHOW it to you!  This left me lost and very frustrated.  This was supposed to be a beginner's video?  I would have been much better off purchasing a book with photos.  The best thing I can say about this DVD is that she had very pretty costumes.  Don't waste your money.",1076803200,8,677,4.537190082644628
1343702,1,B00004RFSC,"Besides terrible camera angles, Dolphina can't really bellydance. She can't isolate her movements, which is a key part of bellydance. She tries to throw in graceful arm movements, but the overall effect is a worm on a hook. She teaches moves improperly, often to the point that the viewer must figure it out on his/her own. She doesn't teach the viewer how to stand or do moves to prevent them from doing them wrong and hurting themselves. Some moves she teaches in ways which you could injure yourself! Other moves she just plain does, teaches, and describes wrong, and in a different way for each! She demonstrates it by not isolating and sometimes even doing the wrong move, she teaches it in ways which are harder or impossible, and describes it in ways which will totally throw you off! ""Learn to bellydance with the ultimate goddess herself, Dolphina"" The ultimate goddess? Give me a break! Taking a few bellydance classes doesn't make you good enough to make a video.
In conclusion this video is good for three things. One: if you just want something fun and don't care if you're dancing wrong. Two: if you already know how to do all the moves and just want someone to tell you in what order to do your practice moves. Three: You want something new to ""self date"" with. Other than that, it's junk.",1074384000,7,1304,4.625
1343703,5,B00004RFSC,"This tape was my first experience with bellydance. I enjoyed it immensly. Though some of the moves were difficult for me, it inspired me to purchase Dolphina's other DVD's and to join bellydance classes in my area.
Dolphina is young, beautiful and very supportive during the video. She really does a great job of breaking down each movement so that they are easy to understand instead of some videos that I have seen that just expect you to watch and follow along. Also I enjoyed the fact that she was knowledgable about the different muscle groups of the body and could describe exactly where and how the move should feel in your body to do it correctly. The sets were gorgeous, and the music inspiring.
My only complaint would be that a few times Dolphina seems to lose her place and I wonder why those moments wern't edited, but overall I did not feel that it was detrimental to my enjoyment of the tape.
I definately suggest purchasing Dolphina's first DVD, Goddess workout Introduction to Bellydance. It really helps break down some of the moves that she goes over in less detail in this, the 2nd installment.
It was so enjoyable that I actually looked forward to coming home and doing the workout, and pursuing bellydance further.",1074211200,5,1236,4.700460829493087
1343704,4,B00004RFSC,"I took a belly dancing class a long time ago and when I spotted this decided to try it again (older, less flexible and not nearly as coordinated as I used to be) by myself at home.  It's fun .. a great warm-up, nice cool-down and she does get all parts of your body involved.  Like other people, though, I was frustrated in trying some of the moves because the camera was focused too closely on her face and upper body when I needed to see what her hips, legs and feet were doing.  I did have a good time with it though - and it made me want to take a class again.  When she tells you to do the move ""with attitude"", it's impossible to not smile and put some attitude into what you're doing.",1070668800,2,691,4.021897810218978
1343705,1,B00004RFSC,"Like another reviewer I found the video frustrating. In order to do the moves demonstrated I needed to see foot/leg/knee positions but, instead, was shown torsos and faces. Quite simply I couldn't reproduce the moves that were demonstrated.",1069632000,2,240,5.342105263157895
1343706,5,B00004RFSC,"I loved this video!  I have been belly dancing for about two and a half years now, since I bought the first Goddess Workout.  I have used several other tapes since, but I always love returning to Dolphina.

The first thing I must emphasize is that THIS VIDEO IS PART OF A SERIES.  Do not try to jump right into this video if you have no belly dancing experience.  Better yet, become familiar with the first video before attempting this one.  Moves to be especially comfortable with are: Camels, Snake Arms, Snakes, Undulations, and Shimmies.  If you have mastered these moves, Warrior Goddess should not be too difficult for you.  However, the Warrior Goddess video does offer a new challenge to those who have mastered the Goddess Workout, so it is definitely worth buying.  Also, if you are a fan of Neena and Veena's Beyond Basic Dance, you should be able to pick up the moves in Warrior Goddess without much trouble, as Neena and Veena use many similar moves.

I have read some of the complaints about Dolphina talking too much during the workout, but I have to disagree.  I find her mood to be playful and fun, and it kept me going during the hips, buns, and thighs section when I thought I was going to collapse!  I felt as though I was getting a great workout, and had a blast doing it.  This tape is a wonderful addition to any belly dance enthusiast's video library.",1065571200,6,1375,4.495967741935484
1343707,5,B00004RFSC,"I have to say that this is a great workout, although it's not for a beginner. Dolphina does not spend a lot of time explaining what to do because this is workout for people who are already familiar with bellydancing moves and dancing in general. If you are, then you will just flow with it.
Contrary to other reviews that say the set is boring, I think the set is absolutely beautiful and relaxing and she is really inspiring so this workout is both visually and spiritually engaging.
I read another review where it says you'll only burn 50 calories and that's not correct! This workout will make you break a sweat if you do the moves correctly.  If you just throw your hips around and not put the correct emphasis on muscles like your upper and lower abdomen, hips, etc., then of course you will not even sweat, but that applies to all exercise in general.
This workout will definitely challenge you and keep you centered while you practice active meditation. I loved this DVD and I will be purchasing the whole Dolphina series.
I highly recommend this DVD for those who already dance and are already familiar with bellydancing moves.",1065052800,10,1135,4.618811881188119
1343708,5,B00004RFSC,"I think this is a 5 star tape, if you are just starting out.  This was my first tape, she explains the basics very well and she is so sexy... I really fell in love with bellydance because of her whole attitude.  I didn't like her more advanced tape... it seemed cold to me.  On this one she has long hair and it's in warm lighting in some nice settings... the second one was cold... an AWFUL set, the camera work was not as helpful for learning to dance, her hair was cut off and I honestly didn't recognize her.  I have bought a lot of the twins tapes also, which are produced really well and which I like, but they don't have the warmth and sexiness of this tape.  If you want to think of yourself as a goddess and you are just starting out, this is a GREAT first tape.  I am very grateful I started with this one, as opposed to some of the weight loss belly dance tapes on the market, which are just horrendous.",1060819200,2,914,4.078212290502793
1343709,4,B00004RFSC,"I am fairly quick to learn, so I was a bit disappointed with this video, when things were not smoothly transitioning. I had never even heard of the instructor, Dolphina, but the workout looked fun, so I decided to try it.
Having done other bellydancing workouts, I feel like the instructor dragged through the explanation of the move, but then threw the viewer into it before they were familiar enough to move through it more quickly. It also really annoyed me when she repeatedly said, ""If you don't get it, just shake something.""  The point of these videos is to do a move correctly, so as to isolate a muscle group. ""Just shaking something"" isn't going to cut it! Another thing I found a bit irritating was when she'd say, ""...as we learned in the first video."" It should definitely state on the box very clearly that this is a follow-up video, and is best done after mastering the first. I can see how the first video might help, as each instructor is different, and one needs to learn each instructor's techniques, but it would have been nice to be prepared to have to compensate and quickly learn some of the moves of the latter workout. I am sure the more familiar I become with this video, the more I'll enjoy it, but it was not what I expected when I bought it.
If you keep good form, and transition at the right times, this does provide a pretty decent workout. The instructor herself seems to be a very proficient belly dancer, which helps. There's nothing worse than watching an instructor fumble through something they aren't familiar with!
I wouldn't recommend this for the beginning exerciser, as some of the moves are sharp, and could easily hyper-extend unprepared muscles.",1058486400,5,1690,4.6521739130434785
1343710,4,B00004RFSC,"Dolphina again provides her viewers with a good workout and an opportunity to learn the basics of bellydance. This is a more advanced tape and not for the beginner. Beginners should first buy Dolphina's ""Goddess Workout.""",1058227200,8,221,5.166666666666667
1343711,4,B00004RFSC,"In this video, Dolphina seemingly corrected all the problems in her first video.
First of all, she chose a simple outfit - pants with a hip scarf - that allows the viewer to see all her movements clearly.  The videographer pans out to show all of Dolphina's body and even shows different angles, a welcome change from her first video which often focused on her face while she demonstrated something.
Dolphina was also a better instructor, describing the movements more in terms of physical actions rather than as spiritual concepts.
Finally, Dolphina went over basic form, very important for belly dancing.  This should have been covered in the first video, but better late than never.
While my fellow viewer and I were disappointed in the lack of set and costume changes, this isn't much to lose in the light of the fact that the video is so much better in other ways.  The entire video takes place in what looks like an empty swimming pool.  This simple background emphasizes Dolphina's form and makes it easier to concentrate on learning from her.",1058227200,4,1050,4.7845303867403315
1343712,3,B00004RFSC,"In a nutshell, I think most of the reviewers have valid points. The highs of the video are the settings, costumes, music, Delphina's personality-which I thought was sincere and humorous and sexy. The lows were it would have been nice if the camera shot her body movements in sync with her instructions as that didn't happen during all the routines. I have taken belly dance classes and her movements are basic belly dance moves, which is great for an introduction to belly dance. The workout will make you sweat and that is a good thing, so give it a chance and be open to the experience.",1058140800,,588,4.556603773584905
1343713,2,B00004RFSC,"First off, let me say that I do not think it is possible to learn belly dancing from a video.  That said, it is particularly difficult to learn from this video.  This so-called Introduction to Belly Dance is more of a whirlwind tour.  I have taken a ten-week beginner class and we did not cover half of this material.
In some ways it is a good video because the frequent changes and the advanced moves made it interesting for me.  The costum changes and scenery is beautiful, and you are sure to get some amusement from Dolphina's SoCal commentary.  ""Sufism, which is a religion"" particularly made me chuckle.  This video is chock full of references to open chakras, energy, and the goddess within.
One failure in the instruction is that the video goes far too quickly.  Another failure is that she does not explain how to execute the move.  In belly dance, much is an illusion.  Unless you talk about and show what parts are actually moving, the video-watcher will be as mystified as anyone else.  The only time I can remember her properly explaining a move was when she explained hip shimmies, showing that the bending knees create the movement of hips from side to side.
Dolphina also does not go over good form, and a novice dancer could hurt her knees or back by not being in the proper dancing position.",1058054400,,1309,4.579399141630901
1343714,2,B00004RFSC,"Yesterday, I finally got to watch The Goddess Workout with Dolphina.  It was scarier than I'd imagined.  No, not Jeanine Rabbitt scary.  It was bad in entirely different ways.
First off, a cursory history of the dance is given.  This would normally be a nice touch, but the degree of misinformation was downright comical.  This is wishtory at its most luvvy-duvvy, new age best.  A hodgepodge of references are made throughout the video to chakras, kundalini, goddesses, sufis and dervishes.  The would-be dancer is even warned at one point that shimmying has the power to cause earthquakes, so you should really check out your intentions before beginning to dance.  My goodness!  I had no idea!  I'm glad she warned me....
From a learner's perspective, the video is extremely frustrating.  I suspect the videographer was enamoured with Dolphina's pretty face, because that's where the camera was focused for much of the tape.  While Dolphina soulfully and breathily explains how her kundalini is being awaken by a particular hip move, instead of focusing on her hips, the camera is aimed at her sincere face and pouting lips.  Also, the camera tends to linger on Dolphina's bust for overlong periods of time, even when the movement being demonstrated is using some other part of the body.
I'm guessing you can only see enough of the movements less than a quarter of the time.  This, in itself, makes The Goddess Workout a terrible instruction video.
When you do see the correct areas of the body, there are still other problems.  Dolphina presents every movement from only one angle:  she directly faces the camera.  There are no side shots, three-quarter views, let alone rear views.  The lack of side shots is especially problematic for such movements as the shimmies.  You cannot see her leg placement at all, here, and a beginner could easily hurt her or himself by hyperextending the knees.  To top it off, in the shimmy section, the section where seeing the legs is the most crucial of all, the legs are completely obscured by a beautiful, flowing pink skirt.
The travelling movements are also especially frustrating, because again, the focal areas are not being shown.  When Dolphina does a travelling hip twist shimmy, her feet are not shown.  It's almost impossible for a would-be dancer to know what to do, here.  Seeing body weight placement and dynamics are vital to comprehension, yet are not provided.
The explanations for movements are also bad.  For instance, while doing hip raises, Dolphina explains that the movement is generated by pushing up with the ball of the foot, up through the calf.  This is wrong, wrong, wrong.  Indeed, she doesn't even follow her own advice.  She does it properly, by using her obliques and hips to lift and drop, but by following her instructions, students, although getting a nice calf workout, will end up dancing in a very clunky, incorrect manner.
I also have issues with one of her warm-up and cool-down exercises.  She encourages dancers to roll their heads all the way around, crunching down through the neck in the back.  This is a dangerous movement, and can easily result in a badly-pinched nerve.
All this being said, there are some good points to this video.  The video quality if superb, the settings are gorgeous, and Dolphina's costumes are elegant and lovely.  However, looking well does not equate to teaching well.
Avoid this video tape, if you're looking for dance instruction.  There are many safer, more informative videos on the market.",1056585600,14,3508,4.933447098976109
1343715,2,B00004RFSC,"Not worth your money.  This is the first tape I purchased and I plan on selling on Ebay, if anyone will actually buy it.  This is not a tape for beginners.  When learning a move they will concentrate on a close up of her face and you can't learn the moves.  I kept yelling ""Zoom Out"" please! I was completely discouraged after 15 minutes.  I think I will try Veena and Nina (or whatever) instead!!",1056067200,2,397,4.24
1343716,4,B00004RFSC,"Understand when you read this that I do not own the Intro to Bellydance video.
I bought this on a whim and read everyone's great reviews of it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Dolphina is a great instructor, and she explains the moves slowly enough so that you get them when she does them slowly.  The atmosphere is very peaceful, and it makes me want to quit my job and do yoga all day (in a good way).
Let me just say that I'm glad no one was around while I tried this!  This has to be the most fun I have ever had while doing a workout even though I am sure I looked completely ridiculous.  I did not even come close to mastering any of the moves, but I want to put it in again and try them over.  Even though I muddled my way through the video, my abs, legs, and butt are tired!  I think this is a great video to throw in the VCR when you're bored with your usual workout and feel like being a sexy lady for 45 minutes.
My only complaint is that she teaches the moves slowly but then jumps right into doing them quickly.  Before you know it, she's moved on to another move, so you didn't really get to get the first one down.  Therefore it will take me many runs of this tape to really be able to do the moves well.  Despite these complaints, though, I actually WANT to keep trying.  This video would be really fun to do with friends if you don't mind embarrassing yourself.  Of course, you can always use your skills to amaze some guy with your beautiful warrior goddess dancing :)
On the whole, kind of difficult, but a lot of fun.  If you don't have the beginner's video down, don't try this one yet.  I am going to buy the beginner's one now and then work up to this one.",1055116800,5,1672,4.073394495412844

1343719,2,B00004RFSC,"I can't recommend this video.  Belly dance is all about muscle isolation, and in order to get a good workout, you really need to have at least the technique basics. Not only is this not explained, but the camera shots are often so tight you can't even *see* the muscles that are supposed to be working. It's too complicated for beginners and not a very good workout for the more advanced dancers who will be able to control the needed muscle groups. But hey, what great costumes!",1048896000,4,479,4.505747126436781
1343720,1,B00004RFSC,"....BR>Firstly, the camera focuses more on dolphina's face than the areas being worked. For instance, when doing hip isolation you don't see dolphina's hips for more than ten seconds. The rest of the time is spent focusing on her smiling face. Meanwhile, you can end up with major back stress/pain if you don't already know the logistics of the isolation exercise she's doing. If I didn't know some belly dancing moves prior to this video, my back would be in big trouble.
Secondly, I didn't feel any burn. The moves don't really focus on toning muscles as much as I had hoped for. Every section is only about five minutes long and, again, either her lack of instruction or the camera only focused on her face made me perform the move wrong so I didn't reap any benefits.
.... If you're looking for a video that's about dolphina's smiling face, then you've got the right workout. If you really want to have fun and get toned, don't buy this video.",1048464000,5,947,4.576470588235294

My recommendation is not to waste your time--beyond borning, annoying and plain old disapponting.  Needless to say, I didn't like the routines, Dolphina's sultry voice or any aspect of this tape from start to finish.  I tried it several times hoping to find some redeeming qualities, but Dolphina was anything but inspiring.  The only inspiration that I got was to write this review.  She is too into her ""sex thing"" to teach me how to Bellydance.  I like exercising at home and was looking for something different.  This tape didn't come close to fitting the bill.

I like how she breaks down the movements, shares fun girly facts, and makes you feel that you too can bellydance. Some of the movements are really difficult and I was laughing at myself, but I must admit that it was still fun and kept me moving the whole video.

Being a musician I constantly am keeping a count in my head. About half the time she doesn't end on the right number, or jumps around. Also, she doesn't really maintain a steady beat, something I consider esential for dancing. This may be just my inexperience with the more flowing eastern music, however.

1343730,3,B00004RFSC,"I bought this Advanced Bellydance Goddess Workout after using Dolphina's Introduction to Bellydance which I enjoy tremendously and rated as 5 stars.  I am a bit disappointed at this one.  First of all, I don't understand why she didn't produce an intermediate one or slow down the pace in this ""advanced"" one and name it intermediate?  I am barely at intermediate level but I still can use this ""advanced"" just not benefit as much.  Even though I am disappointed but I still would say it is a worthwhile purchase.

You can hardly call it a workout because you probably would not burn 50 calories.  Only one third of the program (hips, upper body, undulation,) have a thorough illustration and repetition.  The chest circle and hip circle are hardly illustrated step by step.  Repetition itself is a great workout but there is not enough here. The illustration for ""Figure Eights"" in combination is somehow not clear either. You just have to follow.  This combination part is mainly instructional.  The hips, thighs and buns part gives some workout as I sweat at this point but it is very short.  And then at the shimmy part, it all of sudden gets very difficult/advanced.  The cool down is almost perfunctory.

However, I still benefit from some of the movements, especially, the undulations of dolphin and camel moves which I couldn't get it from her first DVD.  So I would still say it is a worthwhile purchase.

The background of this program is stark, barren and boring.  A contrast to her first video which is colorful and richly cultured with Eastern style.  The camera angles are much better than her last one though. The workout part is really short, only 30 minutes.  An ideal length should be one hour with more repetition to make perfect and sweat.",1038441600,9,1759,4.768211920529802

This is a generally fun workout that really does work most of your body, especially the hips and abs.  The problem is, unless you have practically memorized the first tape you will get lost at times on this one, especially near the end...but if you HAVE memorized the ""Introduction"" tape, there isn't a whole lot of new stuff here.  Dolphina is a very talky instructor, which is a hit-or-miss proposition; while some of her visualizations are helpful (""holding a flawless ruby in your navel and pushing it out"" is great for ab isolations), others are annoying (""You're Pele, warrior goddess of Hawaii"").  To put this in perspective, I'm a Dianic (feminist) Wiccan, and even I found her ""You're a goddess"" lines irritating, especially since she uses them over and over.  As for the ""routine"" at the end, unless you have a photographic memory you'll probably want to review it a few times before you attempt it; Dolphina just launches right into it without breaking down the sequence first, plus she gets off the beat so many times it's embarrassing.  The warm-up and cool-down are not as good as the ones on the first tape, so take a little extra time to stretch before and after.

1343735,4,B00004RFSC,"I really enjoy doing this video. I live in a college dorm with really limits my space, and this is something you can do almost anywhere with little modification. Dolphina has a fun personality and doesn't make you feel silly or awkward while doing the moves. It's easy to get into, and the music is relaxing.
I'm not serious about learning bellydance, though. If you want to get the moves perfect, this isn't for you. The camera rarely shows her feet, and does too many close-ups on her face. So it's difficult to see how she does every part of the move.",1030320000,6,554,4.4411764705882355
1343736,3,B00004RFSC,"Although I enjoyed using this video in getting the basic idea of belly dance, there were times when I really needed to see what the instructor was doing with her feet/legs during an excercise and the camera was only showing her face or the waist-up for basically the entire move. I wished the instructor would have explained some of the excercises in more detail so I could do the activities at an optimal level and be sure I was doing the moves correctly. Overall, the quality of the video was excellent and I did learn a lot. But after doing the video for about two months straight, I'm still not sure if I'm doing some of the moves right!",1029283200,,641,4.394957983193278
1343737,3,B00004RFSC,"It is... OKAY. I say this because I often find myself lost during the video. I have done this workout with my sister, and we both agreed that we needed the camera to focus on her BODY, not her face. We were often left wondering, ""What should we do with our feet??"" The music is wonderful, and the costumes are brilliant. Dolphina is beautiful, and it's understandable that the camera focuses on her face. However, her beauty doesn't help my dancing... I have begun to learn bellydancing from this tape, and I would say that I am progressing, but I think that perhaps I could have started with a better intro-video that was more thorough and explanatory.",1029283200,3,653,4.589743589743589
1343738,5,B00004RFSC,"Wow! Dolphina made a great improvement on this video! Her first video was great, and I had been looking for a more advanced tape since I have mastered all of the moves. I am glad she has made this new one. I definitely felt it in my abs and legs!! Its just what I needed. She teaches more traveling moves that are very beautiful and sensual to watch. At first I didn't think it was going to make me sweat but by the end I sure was!! My legs burned and then the shimmy section came on and made me feel so good! I love to shimmy! Dolphina chose a gorgeous location to add to the beauty of the moves she teaches. If you are a beginner, definitely get the first video also. You won't regret it. And since she doesn't have a more advanced video out yet, for those of you who want a little more of a challenge, I recommend Suzanna DelVecchio's ""Precision Motion Workout"". She will teach you more moves and that one will make you sweat away also!! Its not sold here, but just go to her website and you will find it. I am going to be using both of these videos for my cardio workouts and then in conjuction with pilates I hope to get in the best shape ever!!  Have fun and bellydance!!",1027468800,5,1177,4.1173913043478265
1343739,4,B00004RFSC,"This video is more of a workout than Dolphina's intro to bellydance-- which is as expected since this is for the ""warrior goddess"" as opposed to the beginning goddess.  The moves are much harder to master (I'm a little rusty and plan to go back to the beginner for a refresher now).  Focuses some on the ""core"" abdominal muscles-- perhaps a little Pilates style coaching.  I definitely felt my abs being stretched!  The focus/direction in this video allow the viewer to see *all* of the whole body's movements--not just head & shoulder shots.  Sometimes Dolphina does go a bit fast in ""how to"" do the movement-- you'll have to think about it and practice the moves a number of times before mastery.  Keep your clicker handy & rewind and pause.  It'll give you more workout time, anyway-- and we all know you need at least 20 minutes of workout till you get that fatburning anyway!
The set is gorgeous and interesting; I always wonder where they find these places-- Dolphina is great, too, but (yay) gone are the ""cheesier"" aspects of video one, those superimposed shots of Dolphina's head (a la Debbie does Dallas).
The routine & cool down do, however, feature two new bellydance costumes that can give you some ideas for your own costuming.  (For those of us addicted to the clothing/fashion of bellydance too).  During the rest of the video, Dolphina's clothing is more what you would wear to a bellydance class, as opposed to a performance.
I only gave this one four stars because it is definitely not for beginners, and I felt I would have liked to be able to hear more of the middle eastern music that goes with this style of dance.  But that's just being really picky on my part.  I also think it's going to be much harder for most people to master, so you'll want to get another bellydance video first if you're just starting out.

But primarily, for intermediate to advance bellydancers, this will give you much more of a workout and fatburning once mastered.  It's worth being part of your collection-- anything to keep the fitness video boredom from setting in!
Still, even the best video will never replace an in-person instructor. Use this for days when there's no class in town, and go meet your fellow bellydance devotees at a dance studio near you!",1027382400,17,2263,4.670025188916877
1343740,5,B00004RFSC,"Hi,
 DEFINANTLY 5 STAR!  I have been waiting Excitedly for Dolphina to come out with new instructional videos (I have 3 soon to be 4 of her videos) and I was Not dissapointed ;o)...  I have SEVERAL instructional bellydance videos and she Definantly has some of the BEST instructional videos and this is one of my FAVORITEs ...  It is done in a very uplifting and professional manner, simple and not distracting  (I don't feel like I am stuck in someones dark, dank  basement and I don't feel overpowered by her background or her clothes which makes the moves much easier to follow... and makes me feel calm and  not intimidated as I feel my musles working and getting stronger while enjoying moves I could put to dance ...
 This is WELL worth the Time, effort and money... I am not a professional but bellydance can and does add spice to your life ... (I've been married to the same man for almost 30 years!)
 And if you are like me , if exercise is BORING, I will not stick with it ... This is not at all boring...  Enjoy!",1026950400,3,1023,4.336842105263158

1343742,5,B00004RFSC,"I bought the first video Dolphina outputted, and while I did like it, I did have a few problems with the camera focusing on her midriff, not showing the moves well enough.
Dolphina in this video has resolved a lot of issues that many online reviewers complained about. First of all, the camera does not linger on her torso or face extensively. In this video you pretty much get a full body shot throughout so you can see all she is doing.
She's simplified things somewhat, too, wearing comfy pants and a tank top throughout most of the video, so you can more easily see her movements, until she changes into a costume for the dance routine at the end and for the cooldown. I'll admit I miss all the costumes from the first one; I thought they were beautiful to look at and they offered some great ideas for designing your own.
I've got probably close to 20 bellydance workout videos at home, and whereas some of them gel together (same moves, different dancer, slightly different order) in this one Dolphina offers more variety.
The workout focuses more on the lower body and it's a lot more challenging. The first time I worked out to it I really, really felt it in my abs (like doing situps but you're actually incorporating ab exercises into dance moves).
Dolphina also shows you a lot of dance steps (""Mayas,"" ""camels,"" ""dolphins"" and so on) and layers moves to offer a more challenging workout.
The first time I did the routine I could not mimic all the moves and even rewound some parts to better get a feel for the steps (she does, by the way, explain them very well, but they are more complicated, so if you're out of shape or out of practice you'll have more work in store for you), and I personally liked that. After doing this workout maybe three times a week (but still working out to other bellydance tapes in between), my pants feel a little bit looser and I'm definitely feeling stronger and more powerful, really like a warrior goddess.
The dance routine toward the end is pretty involved, and you can get a better idea of Dolphina's dancing skills, too. It definitely a more difficult workout, and I'm very happy with this tape.",1025481600,11,2145,4.530927835051546
1343743,1,B00004RFSC,myself personaly didn't feel that the tape was all that great. It needs more explanation to do moves. They barelly ever show her whole body moving . It focuses on her face .

1343745,2,B00004RFSC,"This was my first attempt at learning how to bellydance.  This tape concentrates more on Dolphina than teaching.  The moves aren't broken down, and the camera focuses on the mid section about 90% of the time.  You can't really tell how you should move your feet or bend/unbend your knees.  This tape is not for beginners, it's for more experienced dancers.",1020902400,3,356,4.786885245901639
1343746,5,B00004RFSC,"I've enjoyed my Goddess Workout video for over a year. It was my first bellydancing video and though I have purchased others and enjoy them all for different reasons, The Goddess Workout is my favorite. Bellydancing can become addictive and this is the video that did it for me. I think bellydancing is personal expression of being a woman and not about being perfect, but enjoying moving and being confident enough to do so. Dolphina really expresses that clearly in her video. Though the video may have some flaws, Dolphina seems to encourage each woman to realize she is perfect just the way she is and adds interesting tips, history and information along the way to make each viewing interesting. What I find even more interesting is the reaction this video gets. I am always looking for new videos and hoping there will be more Goddess Workout videos and reading the reviews, I can't believe how one video can get such a range of reactions: some love it and feel like it's changed their outlook on life and their body(like me) and others seem positively angry that this video exists. If a video can get such strong reactions, there must be something very powerful that it provokes in the viewer. That's something to explore. Thanks Dolphina!",1018742400,14,1246,4.773148148148148
1343747,3,B00004RFSC,"The video is definitely fun to do and it's beautiful to see, but the problem is with camera placement, since it's focused mostly on Dolphina's midriff and doesn't pan out as much as I'd like it to to better showcase the moves. The warmup is great, one of the best I've seen, and Dolphina is encouraging throughout. The moves are fun, though I don't feel like I'm getting the heart rate up too much as I'm working out, yet afterwards I do feel pretty good and nicely loosened up. Maybe it's that Goddess energy Dolphina is channeling throughout. Really my only problem with the tape is that the routine spends so much time focusing on her midriff while she's explaining leg moves, particularly in the hips and legs section (yes, she does focus on all the areas of the body, from head, shoulders, arms, hips, legs, thighs through shimmies and undulations through a routine to a cooldown). Despite my complaints I still like the tape, and seeing there's new ones coming out, the Warrior Goddess workout is calling to me. Bellydance is addictive.",1018051200,4,1042,4.699453551912568
1343748,5,B00004RFSC,"I have mastered most of the moves in the Bidasha twins' Sensual Art of Bellydance series and was looking for something more advanced. This definitely isn't any more advanced and teaches many of the same moves but I still liked it. I wish that at the end where she teaches you a routine stringing all the learned moves together that it didn't end right after but that she danced it without talking at least one time so that it would have included a little bit of cardio movement. It did not make me work up a sweat, though, so I am going to be using this tape as well as the Sensual series tapes as a sort of warm up and then will just dance away to several Arabic songs for a cardio effect. For a person who is a very beginner, though, this tape may be a little difficult because there are many scenes where the camera focuses on Dolphina's face instead of the body area being worked. You can't see what she is doing and luckily I know the moves already so it wasn't difficult at all.  But after watching and trying several times, you should be able to get it down. I would say maybe even get the Sensual Art series and combine this along with the other tapes for maximum practice!! Once your muscles tone up to the moves, believe me, if you hear any arabic song or any tune that has like sound, you will just shimmy away to it!!...",1017705600,5,1332,4.223529411764706
1343749,1,B00004RFSC,"Sadly, anyone who looks reasonably good in a two piece outfit, has had a few Middle Eastern dance lessons, and has a good publicist can not only produce their own bellydance video these days, but can flog it to an unsuspecting public and no one will be the wiser. That's my review of The Goddess Workout in a nutshell. As a Middle Eastern dancer/instructor with 20 years experience, I am always on the lookout for good videos, especially beginner's videos, to recommend to my students.  The Goddess Workout will not be getting a recommendation from me for several reasons. The movements are not well broken down or not broken down at all. ""Be open"" is not helpful advice for mastering undulations--just take it from me. The importance of basic posture--pelvis tucked, back long, shoulders down and relaxed, knees bent--which is very critical for doing Mid-Eastern dance movements safely and well is not emphasized or even mentioned. The neckrolls are not done properly--you should not allow the head to drop all the way back. The rhythm she identifies as ""zar"" is actually ""beladi"". And on and on. I don't know how long Dolphina has been dancing (and I even went to her website to look it up), but I suspect that she has either not been dancing very long or that she didn't manage to learn very much while she was taking lessons because she seems to be having trouble with her isolations and her movements in general seem awkward. The mark of an experienced dancer is that she is able to isolate her muscle movements and that her transitions are smooth.
  In my opinion, the beginning dancer will be lost, the intermediate dancer will either pick up bad habits or will be frustrated since Dolphina tosses in (without breaking them down) some layered moves (shimmies with Figure 8s, for example) that can take a while to master, and the advanced dancer will be bored, amused, or nauseated (or possibly a combination of all three).
  If you are looking for a New Age belly dance instructional video, I highly recommend Delilah's Bellydance Workshop Vols. 1-3 by Delilah Flynn...  New Age philosophy makes me throw up, but Delilah is an excellent dancer and teacher. If you are looking for a dance teacher in your area, check out Shira's teacher's directory...  Whatever you do, avoid purchasing Dolphina's video.",1017273600,70,2310,4.832911392405063
1343750,5,B00004RFSC,"Dolphina is very feminine, her costumes are fantastic and she
does a good job of teaching.  This dance has done so much for my back.  I even do some of the hip circles while blow drying my hair since I don't have time to dance every day.  It feels so good to move, and she shows us how!",1016755200,,286,3.896551724137931
1343751,4,B00004RFSC,"I do like this video, but I agree that there are parts where the camera could have focused better of exactly what Dolphina is doing.  If you don't already know the moves, you might really find it hard to follow her.  So this is why I think perhaps this tape is not for those who haven't taken any classes at all.  But if you have, and want something that you can do at home to remind yourself of the moves you've learned already, and to keep the exercise going on non-class days, and to feel really good about yourself, then this is a great tape.
The costumes are fabulous; one of the things that belly dance can do is make you obsessed with the things to wear for belly dance.  The sets are interesting; not the bare bones studio sets-- it made me wonder whether these were her home, or what?
Unlike some other reviewers, I actually liked the short sessions with each costume change-- focusing in on a particular part of the body is something we do a lot in class, and it felt familiar, and I didn't have time to get bored & remember that I was working out.  And if you do the whole workout without stopping, then you do get quite sweaty & worked out-- especially the ""shimmy"" section.
The caveat I must add, and a reason my review is just four stars-- Dolphina is into the kind of ""new age"" elements of belly dance. (Although why this is a surprise about a video named after the goddess I'd have to say).  If that kind of culture  bugs you, go after a different video cause she's probably going to get on your nerves talking about chakras and the like.  But I still really liked it, and will continue to work out with it.
But finally, if you want to learn to belly dance, TAKE A CLASS.  Probably there are some in or near your home town-- you'd be surprised-- look for a Greek or Indian or Turkish restaurant and ask them there.  There really is NO substitute for being in a classroom with a real, live teacher.  And you'll get some great opportunities to go out and practice this stuff, live, and become a real belly dancer yourself.",1016582400,2,2036,4.303664921465969
1343752,4,B00004RFSC,"I agree that more time should have been spent on the legs at ""crucial"" moments; however, It is still a great introductory video, if you have a comfortable degree of body coordination. She moves through the workout at a quick pace; but, it's a tape. You're getting your money's worth by having some moves that are too difficult to get immediately. And, as you do the moves, even though some leg shots are missing, your body begins to naturally flow in the right direction (& you see the leg shots eventually; they just should be coordinated together better). I also like the Balag-di drum rhythm, the goddess/chakra approach & the fun & historically feminine workout (& I think her costumes are beautiful). My body feels great inside & out. I've noticed in reading several ""belly dance"" tape reviews that some novices that were having trouble were really angry. I'm a novice, too; but, as someone who has had to learn to play intruments like the frame drum, I want to tell you that it takes time to get back into a natural motion & rhythm when your culture has been so long removed. If you're a novice that likes the ""give it all to me & I'll take what I can handle"" approach, get this tape. If you want to go really slow, pick another.

I chose to buy this video because of the sensuality expressed in bellydancing, not for the workout qualities, although I am enjoying those very much as well. Dolphina is a beautiful woman and is very confident and sensual in her teaching. She tells the viewer even to do the maneuvers ""like a Goddess"" and progress to the world how fabulous you are! I think it is inspiring, not intimidating, to watch her video and learn the techniques of belly dancing as she presents them. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone interested in pursuing not only the workout involved in bellydancing but also the extreme femininity and sensuality you will experience from learning the art of bellydance.",1008547200,6,914,4.865384615384615

If you're looking for a workout that is a change of pace and a workout that will make you feel sexy, give it a shot.

I do agree it was a little corny at first-just her voice and the way she'd look at the camera (didn't know if the intent was to get me moving or turn me ""on"").  However, it does make me feel exotic, her body is motivating, and I can't wait to show the moves to my hubby (after practice of course/I haven't let him see the video b/c then he'll think of her!).

I like to workout to videos because of my schedule and I like to try new forms of exercise, as your body does get used of the same exercise.  I've seen alot of videos , from the workout gurus: Kathy Smith and Denise Austin and other bellydance videos.  The Goddess Workout is just as good of a workout as some of the  videos, such as Kathy Smith's Latin Cardio, and the production is just as beautiful to look at as Cindy Crawford's.  I am a demanding customer and I get bored when  I can do the video just as good as the instructor with the first viewing. I like when videos are not shot in a studio and I learn new things about my workout and life with each viewing, as does The Goddess Workout.

The camera person was obviously more interested in showing Dolphina's fact off than in showing the part of her body that was actually doing the move. This means it is often difficult to imitate what she is doing since you can't see it. The editing of the video is also terrible sometimes you are doing a movement along with her and the video cuts to her doing the movement a few seconds later leaving you in the wrong position.

The video itself is beautifully arranged...which is why I gave it a two. The costuming, setting, music, constant smiling and the special effects were carefully detailed. However the camera work and attention to highlighting movements were not.
The video is more like a showpiece for Dolphina who is graceful and beautiful. But that is not what I was looking for. The poor camera work fails to show the moves clearly or at all! The focus on her face and other body parts while she explains or performs the moves does not help you with them; the costuming choices hide the posturing and nuances when the camera is occasionally in the right place.
I would look elsewhere if you want to use a tape for belly dance instruction and workout. Some reviewers liked this tape --I didn't, in fact I received it today and it is already boxed up so that I can ship it back tomorrow!",998006400,20,1136,4.546341463414634
1343768,5,B00004RFSC,"I went on a shopping binge and bought 6 bellydance videos (I had always wanted to learn) and this was my favorite. This video ( and Shamira's video) captured the essence of why I wanted to bellydance in the first place: it's mystical, fun, sensual, beautiful and graceful. And, I actually could bellydance after I did this video 4 times this week. She teaches alot of moves with a natural flow and ease. The moves are sometimes challenging to do, but the instructor(Dolphina) gives you modifications on how to do the moves both beginning and advanced, which is great because then I won't be bored after doing the video over and over which I will.",996883200,5,646,4.626086956521739
1343769,5,B00004RFSC,"I haven't been ""belly dancing for 25 years"" as some of the other reviewers have, and maybe Dolphina doesn't get a perfect 10 for technical expertise, but if you want to feel sensuous and excited just to be a woman, this is the workout video for you.
I never have liked working out just for the sake of ""working out."" But if I can do something enjoyable and get a physical benefit from it, great.  This workout provides just that.  It makes for great ""chick time"" with the added benefit that you get some serious toning and stretching that you really feel the next day.
I also think it's important NOT to focus on getting each move so absolutely perfect that you miss the whole point.  Can't do a move?  Can't see exactly how she's doing it? Be a Goddess and improvise!
As for her being a ""Playboy Bunny type"" just because she's comfortable with her body and obviously enjoys being a woman, I didn't get that feeling at all.  Dolphina is very pro-woman and pro-femininity, and she just reminds us that being a woman is a wonderful thing.
If you're looking for a belly dance instruction video, this probably isn't for you.  If you're looking for a ""Jane Fonda Make It Burn"" type of workout, this probably isn't for you.  But if you want to flex and stretch and tone with the ultimate sensual mood music playing in the background and your personal coach reminding you throughout that femininity is a good thing, this video might be just what you're looking for.",992995200,20,1458,4.520912547528517
1343770,1,B00004RFSC,"I am a bellydance instructor. I buy videos to get ideas for choreography and interesting moves. Dolphina's video is shot in beautiful locations, and I like the fact that she changes into different cute outfits for each segment...her full costume at the end of the video is quite lovely. The skill level however, is very beginnerish...many of the moves are incorrectly done & poorly explained. The camera man should also have been clued in that the body needs to be shown, not close-ups of the dancer's face. Dolphina looks good as long as she is moving slowly ( the warm-up segment), but when she executes the faster movements, she looks jerky and spasmodic...my husband (a co-instructor), actually laughed during the opening dance segment. I think Dolphina needs to stick with yoga until she has a LOT more lessons herself! What is really sad is that many women will buy this video and learn the incorrect way to bellydance! This video was a complete waste of money.",991440000,20,967,4.831325301204819

But it's a good introduction to bellydancing.  I had never bellydanced before, and by my second try at this tape, I was really getting the hang of it!  I did have to mark it down a star because Dolphina is just so cheesy!  I think she must have been a porn star in another life.  At one point during the cool down, she gives out this big moaning sigh...jeesh!  And the production value is the same... This is alot of fun though, and I can't say that for many of the workout tapes I own.  One hint--I find it much more fun with a fringy scarf tied around my hips!",988761600,5,727,4.142857142857143

I recommend this video to anyone wanting something new and fun!",986947200,4,327,4.190476190476191

I use this video every other day and can definately see the results.  The only criticism I have is that more full body shots are needed to really understand how to do the moves.  However, if you consistently use this tape, it really doesn't matter.  You quickly catch on and can do the moves without watching Dolphina.",986083200,2,490,4.651162790697675

The only flaw is that they often showed her face and chest. I guess because she's quite beautiful and makes you wish you would look like her after doing the video a hundred times!{fat chance}Overall, I enjoyed her video and my arms and stomach are always sore everytime I do the workout. After a month and doing it 3 times a week I can see and feel the difference and I starting to have a muscle line in my midriff. My size 5 jeans are starting to feel looser in the waistline and hips .You have your money worth with this video. Count me in for her next video and hopefully it will be more challenging.",984873600,5,770,4.317241379310345
1343776,2,B00004RFSC,"Wonderful images and costumes. Unfortunatly, the video contains more footage of her face and chest areas than her feet. Her costumes hide her legs so you can not see how the moves are done. She is a beautiful dancer and the music is lovely but for beginers it is not a tape I would recomend. More experinced dancers might get something out of it but overall if your new to dancing do not get this tape.",982540800,6,402,4.302631578947368

However, as a 25 year veteran of belly dance, I would not recommend this tape to a serious student of the dance.  Although the upper body movements are smooth, many of the hip movements do not demonstrate good isolation (which is the key to this dance), and the execution of movements and transitions during demonstrations do not appear to be those of an accomplished dancer, in my opinion.  With all due respect to Dolphina for trying to bring the spiritual aspect of the dance to light in a beautiful setting, this tape does not display the level of technical expertise we, as belly dancers, have worked so hard to bring to light over the years, in order to gain the respect it deserves within the general dance community.",981590400,12,878,4.688311688311688
1343778,4,B00004RFSC,"This video is beautifully produced, and therefore lovely to watch. If you are new to belly dance, you might find following Dolphina to be a challenge--she isn't very good at describing transitions from one move to the next. If you have had some introduction to bellydance (I danced for 3 years, myself), this video is fun to follow and watch. If you are looking for a good cardiovascular workout, I suggest you look elsewhere, though. You just don't get a good sweat with this. However, it is a good workout for building some muscle tone and coordination.",981072000,3,555,4.731958762886598

I read about The Goddess Workout in a magazine and ordered the video and CD.  That was about six months ago and everything has changed. This workout truly helps attain alignment. I read the other reviews, and everyone deserves an opinion, but mine is that this video can give you so much more than just the visual, which is indeed beautiful. You can look at Dolphina as a ""playboy bunny"" type, but I see a woman who owns her power as a woman and wants to share this knowlege with others.",979603200,11,628,4.452173913043478

I am overweight and needed to find a type of exercise that wasn't too strenuous and enjoyable . . . something I could and would want to stick with. As far as the style and history of bellydancing, I am no expert. As far as exercise tapes and workouts, I am a veteran. I have tried just about every type of fitness there is. I left this workout feeling invigorated and refreshed. Whether or not this provides a truly accurate protrayal of bellydancing essentials, I am not sure. Does this tape follow traditional instruction for bellydancing? I have no idea. All I know is that I feel great! I thoroughly enjoyed this tape and will continue to enjoy it. This tape has opened a doorway for me into the realm of bellydancing. I am sure I will enjoy tapes with other instructors. This tape will definetly be the one I use primarily for exercise!",978739200,5,894,4.391566265060241
1343781,3,B00004RFSC,"I was very excited about getting this video, but I have to say I was disappointed. Dolphina looks and acts like she should be in adult videos, not fitness videos. The camera angles were very unhelpful, they kept zooming in on Dolphina's great abs and chest, but never her legs and feet so you could see how she was doing the moves! Her costumes were beautiful as was the set, but never did she try to explain the fundamentals of the moves, she would just start shaking it and expect you to keep up!
All in all I'd say it's the kind of video your boyfriend or husband talk you into buying so that they can watch it when you finally realize how worthless it is!",978307200,4,659,4.238095238095238

The constant location and costume changes are pretty, but they add nothing to the workout, the ""goddess"" element is uninformed pop-new age (I am a Pagan, so I don't necessarily have a problem with new age per se) and the camera angles are AWFUL.  Over and over the camera focused on Dolphina's head and chest when she was performing lower body movements.  Have you ever tried to mimic an ankle to chest undulation while staring only at a girl's breasts?  It's HARD.  On the other hand, the workout is fun, and my guy friends love to watch it.  At times the routines went from very simple steps to relatively hard steps without a perceptible transition, but perhaps this will become easier as I keep using the tapes.  It will work your arms well, and it does give you a general idea of the isolations involved in belly dancing.  It is simple enough for beginners, but I would not recommend it to anyone who has had more than three belly dancing lessons.  Borrow it before you buy if you can.",978220800,9,1096,4.522842639593908

However, if you've never bellydanced before, it might be a little frustrating as a lot of the camera angles make it hard to figure out what she's doing.  There are a lot of unnecessary face shots of Delphina smiling and talking, and though she is a beautiful girl and very friendly you'll be falling over your own feet trying to figure out what the rest of her is doing.
All in all not a bad tape.  I would suggest buying this one and a couple of others (I personally really like the Shamira tape) and rotating them.  Once you figure out the moves, this tape is fine.",975628800,8,664,4.296

The sets and  costumes are fantastic.  Dolphina does an excellent job of breaking each  movement down into manageable pieces.  The end routine is fun and it feels  like an accomplishment.  The routine is not ""professional"" by any  means, but Dolphina must keep the routine and moves simple for us-the  beginning belly dancer!

While the other videos do have positive qualities, they lack  the special quality The Goddess Workout has over all the others. The  Goddess Workout is a beautiful video that makes me feel beautiful. I look  forward to my workout everyday and feel like Dolphina has given me the  secret to enjoying life. Everything about the Goddess Workout is amazing:  the music, the set, the costumes. Dolphina is beautiful, like a goddess,  but not intimidating. The video by Veena and Neena is good, but I hate the  music and it lacks the spiritual aspect which Dolphina naturally embodies.  The Magical Motion one is ok, but Atea is very awkward to watch. I would  recommend the other videos, but if you were to have only one video,  definately get The Goddess Workout",967680000,54,994,4.709302325581396

If you're advanced, you'll feel silly while the instructor randomly chuckles throughout this belly dance video. Dolphina is over-rehearsed and seems sarcastic throughout most of her presentation that is explained once and gets you lost afterwards, since all she does is babble on and on.

It's great for releasing tension in your neck and shoulders and always leaves me with a fluid and sexy feeling.  Very empowering.  My favorite part is the Goddess walk (at least that's what I call it) when Dolfina instructs you to ""do it with attitude...it's like saying aren't I fabulous?""  Some reveiwers commented on not being able to see what she's doing because of the camera angeles.  I have taken a belly dance course in the past so this was not an issue for me.  But I find that even if you didn't have prior knowledge if you watch the workout once first you can figure it out.  She also gives you instructions all throughout so listening to what she's saying is also helpful.

And now that I've sampled other DVD instruction by professional dancers, I can see I was correct in thinking she was all about trying to look sultry and alluring and not so much about teaching the dance. Granted, back then I couldn't make it through the arms section, but that's because they're my weakest area and she did them to death.

My experience with this video made me check reviews before making a purchase because I didn't want to make the same mistake twice. And I didn't. If you're interested in belly dance taught methodically and well, I would suggest looking into New York World Dance's DVDs and videos. One of the DVDs I own, ""Love Potion,"" includes an instructional section, a practice flow, the workout dance using the moves learned before, and an extra choreographed dance at the end.

It's a little funny though, how Dolphina makes weird faces sometimes.  If you are looking for a workout were you can sweat a lot, this isn't for you, but if you want to learn to bellydance this is a good video.
Another thing, it's pretty long, I usually get tired halfway through the video.  Mostly my arms.  By the way, the costumes she wears are really cute, and the settings are nice.

I don't find Dolphina's references to religion, chakras, or any of the other less-than-commercial ideologies to be detrimental - more her personal view of the inner workings of the dance.  I enjoyed it, and found it to be well planned and beautifully presented. Some of the production values - sound, and camera angles, could have been better... (sometimes you can't see her feet, for a move, sometimes the crashing ocean makes her words difficult to hear), but overall I found it to be an excellent value, an enjoyable session, and probably a lot more akin to the dances of our ancient mothers, in character, than some of the Raqs Sharqi instructionals structured in discipline like a modern ballet class.

It has a warm up, exercises, routines and a cool down. It adds a little spice to what would normally be boring and mundane squats, lunges and ab work but because you're dancing and focusing on your body's movements, you're less aware of the burn you feel when you get a good work out. It's not incredibly intense but some dances are challenging and I'm thinking, Dolphina slow down -like when she just goes off the deep end shimmying into oblivion.
