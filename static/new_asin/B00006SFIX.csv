1792103,2,B00006SFIX,"EEGAH is a wretchedly amateurish retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story.  Written, directed and starring the notorious Arch Hall, Jr.  it features wooden acting (mainly by Hall), a preposterous script and a smattering of terrible songs (totally Hall.)  EEGAH stars Richard (""Jaws"") Kiel in the title role, clad in a side split single strap skirt and hidden behind a ZZ Top beard.
 EEGAH is just awful, and I wouldn't give it any stars if not for the dead-canary-in-the-coal-mine comments on the dvd jacket.  The publicists call EEGAH one of those ""rare existential movies"" that is ""really an avant-garde classic.""
 Some bored French intellectual is going to watch this discount dvd and cry `eureka.'  They'll write an article in a publication you can't afford shoveling praise as high as an elephant's rump on a movie you haven't seen.  The earth will stand still for a moment, Arch Hall, Jr. will become yet another secular saint and you'll be behind the curve yet again.
 EEGAH can be had today for less than the price of a cup of iced latte.  After he's `discovered' the only edition will be a $50 Criterion Collection edition with commentary tracks by Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorcese.  Do you really want that to happen?",1088899200,3,1235,4.861244019138756
1792104,5,B00006SFIX,"Eegah! The Name Written in Blood!  When I bought this movie, I knew what I was letting myself in for because I was working in a movie theater when we showed this film, and I can definitely, unequivocally, and categorically state that it was NEVER, EVER released; it ESCAPED! Josef Stalin once said that quantity has a quality all its own. Like quantity and quality, WORST has a CHARM all its own, which is why there should be an Academy Award category for it. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes notwithstanding, this IS the worst movie ever made, which is why I bought it. The budget was so low that youd swear at times no sound recording equipment was taken to the filming location; the sound AND dialog were dubbed later in the studio.  Eegah! stars Richard Kiel in the title role as a sensitive last descendant of pre-historic cavemen living with the mummified remains of his ancestors (with whom he has ""conversations"") in the desert outside Palm Springs at the time of the story (1962). He is discovered by the heroine, Roxie (played by Marilyn Manning) who accidentally hits him with her sports car out on a lonely stretch of highway while driving to a party one night. He is so large that he is unhurt by the accident, and she pretends to faint at the sight of him. He is scared off by her boyfriend, Tom (Arch Hall, Jr.); but when they look for him the next day, he captures her and her father, and holds them hostage. A particularly bad scene is the one in which she makes a mess out of her attempt to shave off his fake beard.

Arch Hall Sr.) as Miller goes beyond the city into the desert wilds where Shadow-Mountain is to find the giant only to end up as his prisoner. Roxy and Tom go after him only to find themselves trying to save each other and their father from the clutches of the mean but misunderstood giant.

A horrible 60's adventure movie that is one of the worst movies of all time. Arch Hall Jr. just can't act as he may look like an early Leonardo DiCaprio at times but can't hold a grudge and the acting is just horrible, the music is corny and the plot is numbing. Your jaw will drop at how bad it is, in fact the crew at Mystery Science Theater 3000 riffed it nicely and that is the only way to view this piece of trash.

1792119,2,B00006SFIX,"Well, the Bible says a lot of things. Doesn't mean we should make movies about them. From the opening shots of the actors names painted on the cheap haunted house decorations that pass for Eegah's family, you just know this is going to be that special kind of schlock, like ""Teenagers From Outer Space"", that will win an eternal place in your heart. Arch Hall jr. gives David Love a serious run for his money as the lead, a goofy haired valley boy with a dune buggy that looks as if it's falling apart and a pack of overdubbed songs. His girlfriend hits a giant caveman, played gallantly by Richard Kiel, with her car. Her pops (played by Arch Hall Sr.) sets off onto a desert mountain to find Eegah, with the two kids in hot pursuit. The mysterious ""Watch out for snakes!"" that seems to come out of nowhere earns frequent mention, but Eegah! is full of great corny dialogue. ""Now, my credit cards are in the desk drawer. You make sure you leave them there!"" ""Large man or giant creating disturbance"". Feast for the ears of the comically inclinded.

1792120,1,B00006SFIX,"I have to believe that Richard Kiel, who played ""Jaws"" in two James Bond movies, is embarrassed by his role in this movie that is about as cheesy as a movie in this genre, whatever genre that may be, can be.  On the other hand, this movie is a step up from Kiel's first role as a Solarite in ""The Phantom Planet,"" where his face was covered.  The plot of this movie has more holes than anything I know.  The acting is reasonably awful.  The lyrics to the songs are cheesy, or worse.

As the movie begins, we meet young and beautiful Roxy Miller (Marilyn Manning, who was apparently a secretary near Arch Hall, Sr.'s studio; her career spanned three movies).  Soon Roxy is driving down the road and runs smack into a giant caveman.  The caveman appears to be carrying a deer and a club (returning from shopping, perhaps).  The caveman, who we later learn is called Eegah (Kiel), is immediately smitten by Roxy.  Fortunately for Roxy, another car drives up.  It turns out that Roxy's boyfriend Tom Nelson (Arch Hall, Jr.) is driving the car.  Had Tom arrived any later, Roxy might have been making out with a caveman in the desert.

At some point Tom utters a classic line.  ""I swear on my Elvis Presley LP.""  Dialogue just hardly gets any better than this.  I also enjoy it when Tom is singing about some babe named Vicky when Roxy is his girlfriend.

Tom and Robert Miller (Arch Hall, Sr.), Roxy's father, go with Roxy to the location where she saw the giant.  Mr. Miller decides to go off into the desert of southern California to look for the giant after the trio finds a giant footprint.  When the helicopter is unable to retrieve Mr. Miller, Tom hops into his dune buggy and with Roxy goes to find Mr. Miller.  Tom is soon destroying desert habitat, including rare desert plants, just so he can prove to Roxy how macho he is.  The next thing you know, Roxy and Tom are getting ready to spend the night in the desert and Tom pulls out his guitar.  Backing vocals kick in, whistling starts, electric guitars join in, and suddenly Tom sounds like he is in a studio somewhere.  This time Tom sings about Valerie.  Roxy kind of gets her revenge for Tom's longing for other women later.

Tom's singing is really nothing to write home about, but it turns out that, like the Pied Piper, his singing attracts creatures.  My guess is that the creatures show up to stifle Tom.  In this case, the creature is Eegah.  Eegah is frightened away, but the next day Tom leaves Roxy at the dune buggy to search for her father and Eegah takes the opportunity to kidnap Roxy.  Eegah soon sets up house with Roxy, except Eegah decides he wants more than a shave and a meal.  Tom shows up in the nick of time to save Roxy's honor, but Roxy looks wistful as she sees Eegah on the hilltop as they leave the desert.  After all, if Tom can sing about other women, Roxy can have a caveman as a second boyfriend.

Later, Eegah decides he is unable to live without Roxy, so he goes to great lengths to track her down.  Unfortunately, few people are able to understand a caveman wandering about, so they had to take action.  Poor defenseless Eegah just did not know what he was up against.  I suspect that Roxy broke up with Tom soon after.  After all, there was no way that Tom could compete with Eegah.

The transfer for this movie is reasonable.  The picture was generally clear and the sound was okay.  I do have to wonder why I am concerned about the quality of the DVD.  This movie is awful.  The plot is silly.  How could a caveman exist in southern California with no one knowing?  How was Eegah able to find Roxy?  I know she had perfume, but Roxy rode in a vehicle a lot, leaving no trail.  I know the movie went to great lengths to explain that Eegah was friendly, but Eegah was a caveman, and a seven foot tall caveman should have been more forceful than he was.  Regardless of what the opening credits show, Eegah does not kill anyone, other than the audience, who die from boredom.

Unsurprisingly, this movie has made a number of ""worst movie"" lists.  The acting is awful.  The dialogue is uninspired.  The singing is not awful, but the lyrics of the songs are awful.  About the only thing that really made sense was Eegah attempting to undress Marilyn Manning.

Instead of watching this turkey, find the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version instead.  Trust me; you will be glad you did.

Good Luck!",1142640000,3,4387,4.425531914893617
1792121,3,B00006SFIX,"Forget all that Quest For Fire, Clan Of The Cave Bear nonsense, this is Eegah!  Eegah, man!  On the books Eegah! is considered one of the worst films of all time(obviously the writers of these lists hasn't seen any Michael Bay films), but you do have to admit that it certainly has one of the best titles in film history.  In Eegah! we have a chick who sees a caveman(Eegah's his name) on the highway en route to go swimming.  She faints, wakes and tells her boyfriend and father about the experience.  The father(he's a scientist) decides to take a trek to the mountains to find Eegah.  He's then captured by Eegah.  Eegah!!!!  The girl then brings her boyfriend along to look for her dad.  The boyfriend(Arch Hall, jr.) is one of those rockin' and rollin' teenagers who has a few musical numbers in the film.  This guy's so cool he can get the sound of an entire rock band simply by strumming his acoustic guitar.  I  think the rock and roll hairdos men had in the 50s and 60s actually look pretty cool, but Hall's is grotesque.  In fact, Hall is just creepy and weird looking period.  Eegah captures the girl and drags her to his cave where she meets up again with her dad, and I'll tell you folks, Eegah is horny!  He's definitely got plans to show this chick his caveman's club.  In a long and tedious sequence, the girl and her dad try to strike up some kind of communication and understanding with Eegah, but he simply will not keep his hands off her.  The entire time he is groping, smelling or stroking her.  We all know what's on Eegah's mind, but his horniness is his weakness and it enables the two to escape.  Back in the clutches of Arch Hall(you wonder if she is worse off in this dork's hands or Eegah's), they head back to civilization(which looks like it's about a half mile away) and try to forget it all by going to a ""hop"".  At the ""hop""(no pun intended) Arch sings us another rockin' number.  Mid-song he decides he wants to dance with his girl, so he hands his guitar to another guy to continue, and the strumming never skips a beat during this handoff.  Eegah has gotten away from his cave and ventured into the city and has had no problem locating his new girl at the ""hop"".  He apparently smelled his way to her with an article of clothing she had left behind.  This is the big climax of the film.  Who's left standing, Eegah or Arch Hall, jr?  Believe it when folks say this film is bad.  Bad, yes, but what exactly would you expect from a 60s caveman film called Eegah?  It would have been much more effective in b&w, coz the color looks kinda crappy.  Richard Kiel probably isn't too proud of this role.  He's got the whole look and act of a decent caveman I suppose(I've never met one).  He's never allowed to speak though.  Actually he's dubbed.  There's constant caveman grunts, slurping and gibberish coming from him, but never once do you see his mouth move.  Classy.  This film is usually my response when someone asks me what my favorite movie is.  Try it sometime.  When you get down to it, Eegah is exactly what you expect of it, so watch at your own risk.  Eegah!",1140912000,7,3102,4.37719298245614
1792122,1,B00006SFIX,"The English language doesn't really have a word to describe how bad of a movie Eegah! truly is. It was made by someone named Arch Hall, Sr. as a vehicle for his completely talentless son Arch Hall, Jr. Junior isn't handsome to look at, can't act and can't sing as we find out when he sings not 1, but 2, horrid songs in the movie.

The story, if you care, is Arch's girlfriend meets a 7 foot prehistoric man in the desert, played with deep embarrassment and shame by Richard Kiel. Her father decides to hunt the caveman down so he can study him and write a book about him. It takes about 2 minutes for dad to get captured by Eegah. So the daughter takes Arch Jr. out to look for dad. The daughter also gets taken captive and of course Eegah is smitten with her. This all leads  to a scene where she shaves Eegah with the encouragement of her own father. You will need to shower after watching this scene.

It's left to Junior to be the hero, and even though he's really not up to it, they all eventually escape Eegah. But you can't stop love, or caveman lust, so he comes to civilization looking for the girl.

One of the worst movies ever made. And even that sentence does not do justice to how awful this film is.",1137628800,5,1215,4.201716738197425
1792123,2,B00006SFIX,"So, a gal named Roxy (Marilyn Manning) is out for a drive one night, when -Bam!- she hits a caveman (Richard Kiel) standing in the road. The next day no one believes her story, but her dad (Arch Hall sr.) decides to go look for said troglodyte in a helicopter anyway. Well, dad fails to return, so Roxy and her swingin' boyfriend, Tommy (Arch Hall jr.) head out to the desert in his dune buggy to search for dad. Along comes Eegah (the cave guy) who kidnaps Roxy! Tommy must now find her before Eegah has his way with her, right in front of her captive father! The true horror of EEGAH! is Arch Hall jr. himself! He warbles his way through several mind-destroying ballads and ""rock"" songs! I recommend speeding through these horrid numbers! Still, this is nowhere near the total wretchedness that is NASTY RABBIT, Arch Hall jr.'s ultimate experiment in audience torture. Oh well, at least Kiel went on to become semi-well known in movies. The Halls just disappeared into blessed oblivion.

7972953,2,B00006SFIX,"there is something truly truly about this flick from the swingin' 60s. I don't know if it's the perfect outdoor singing (with invisible female back-up singers) or the 'fab' use of that 'zany' dunebuggie.
it's set in the early 1960s USA when people were white and good-mannered to their elders. there's a 'cool dude' who swears on his Elvis Presley record - so you just KNOW it's deep. his 'girlfriend' comes across  a prehistoric man holed up in some desert caves with his skeletal family remains, she faints on cue every time she sees him and he just grunts n stuff. the girlfriend's father is some town-big-wig whom I presume considers himself a wit (of some sort).
apart from the 'kids'  groovin' out to this EEGAH chap, nothing much really makes up the rest of this flick. there is a 'swingin' poolside-party at the climax and the girlfriends' father is there with his servant-man (I think) who makes some kind of (lewd) gesture at him with his hand to his mouth to which he nods approval and they walk off screen (and are not seen again). the cops show up (for some unknown reason) and decide to 'end' the party/flick.
