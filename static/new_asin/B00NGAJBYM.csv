8677877,5,B00NGAJBYM,I enjoyed this DVD choc full as it is with Bon Jovi filmed interviews and press conferences from right across their career. I've watched the whole thing twice through so far and probably will again so it works as a film that bears elevated viewings.,1434585600,4,249,4.555555555555555
8677878,5,B00NGAJBYM,"Buyers beware! Bon Jovi: In their own words is the SAME as Bon Jovi: Survivors, only without the second disc with the interviews. I was disappointed when I found this out. I wasted my HARD earned money for it. If you want these interviews get Bon Jovi: In their own words. As a show it is still  very good.nw",1418774400,7,308,4.220338983050848
