If you know a young person who is interested in making films, Chasing Rodriguez would be an inspirational movie to see.",1347667200,,347,4.596774193548387

We rented this because it was filmed around our home town.",1470873600,,131,4.909090909090909
8539007,1,B009B0SPSY,"I'm watching this movie as I write this review. Where do I start....? I'm not really sure what the plot is. Why do hair colors change on the actress? They look like cheap wigs.  What's with the clowns? Why do you need to tell me that the movie is ""family friendly"" on the packaging, shouldn't that be evident by the tone of the cover art? Was this script found at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box?  Some shots are out of focus, and it doesn't appear to be for artistic reasons.",1377907200,2,477,4.173913043478261
8539008,4,B009B0SPSY,"""Chasing Rodriguez"" is a movie for everyone -- everyone who enjoys a good, fast-paced action movie that can be watched with the whole family.
The teenagers in the movie are extraordinary -- energetic, funny, and real.  We care about the movie because we care about them.
This is good movie-making.  The humor in the movie is honest and real and helps propel the story.
If you have children from ages 5 to 18, get this movie, sit down with them and a giant popcorn, and enjoy it together.

8539009,5,B009B0SPSY,"My family couldn't wait for this DVD to arrive, we saw it in the theater and loved it.  Now that that we have the DVD, the kids watch it over and over, they love the dialogue, the characters, and the story.  This is a family-friendly action/comedy/drama with intrigue and lots of quotable lines your kids will repeat (""Wow, this is INTENSE!"") I was especially impressed with the quality of acting and cinematography in a film made on a shoestring budget.  One note: two characters wear clown masks in some scenes, so that could be a little scary for very young kids.  My 7 yr old has a slight fear of clowns, but once she saw scenes of them w/out their masks, she was fine with it, especially because they aren't scary at all, just bumbling. My kids want to see a sequel!!",1350691200,,772,4.415492957746479
8539010,5,B009B0SPSY,This film is family oriented and keeps you interested in what about to happen great job with all the cast members,1350432000,,113,4.428571428571429
8539011,5,B009B0SPSY,"A perfect family film.  Filled with adventure and action, this DVD will capture the interest of young children as well as teens.  Be prepared for a few laughs too.",1348531200,,163,4.586206896551724
8539012,5,B009B0SPSY,"Never before has such a touching, heartwarming film succeeded so well as both a captivating family film and an thrilling adventure. It finds its way into the hearts of people from all walks of life and fills their soul with happiness and joy.

Most masterful of all was the cinematography. Scenic landscapes and a deep focus allow the viewer to take in the breadth and beauty of the Northern California setting and drives us deeper into the film's world.

The bumbling antagonists are a particular delight. Not since the Marx Brothers has such quickfire dialogue and physical comedy been used to such spectacular effect.

This film has it all: Passion, action, stunts, comedy, and grumpy old guys playing chess in a park. It makes me want to have kids just so I could share it with them. In fact, I went 'round the local middle school and asked if any of them wanted to come over and watch it. I just got a lot of funny looks and kids turning and running away screaming excitedly. Presumably to steal their parents' credit cards and order their own copy. Glad I could help!",1348358400,,1073,4.607329842931938
8539013,5,B009B0SPSY,What a surprise! The writing is brilliant and the production is remarkably clever and polished for a low-budge indy flick. A definite must watch.,1348272000,,145,5.083333333333333
8539014,5,B009B0SPSY,"Chasing Rodriguez is a fun movie, great for the whole family!  Action, drama and humor too. Kids especially will love it.",1347926400,,121,4.761904761904762
8539015,5,B009B0SPSY,"We also saw this in the theater, twice! My kids liked it so much the first time they insisted on going to see it again. It's a great family film, with action, comedy and drama. There is no violence or bad language. (the most violent is a couple of pointed guns, but no one gets shot or hurt.) Support independent film making and buy this movie!",1347667200,2,344,4.2272727272727275
