6796288,5,B00PC7BL2W,I'm really good friends with the director and his wife. I have watched this movie 3 times and enjoy it. The scenes with the girls shooting video really made the movie stand out to me. I hope they make a second one.,1500076800,,214,4.119047619047619

6796290,4,B00PC7BL2W,Awesome Blu Ray release.  Special features are cool and informative.,1499904000,,68,5.8
6796291,5,B00PC7BL2W,"Okay, so I had a chance to get a Blu Ray copy of this movie online which apparently is much harder to do seeing that it's mainly sold as either DVD or streaming.
I'm one of those who likes to watch and have a bulk of my movie collection in the highest quality format available, and when I saw the trailer of this movie a year or so ago I really wanted to watch it. I just always forgot to either rent it online, or bite the bullet and get the DVD. So it was just by a fluke that I came across this on Blu Ray and bought it immediately.
Then during it's shipment, I saw the negative reviews it had and how it lacked story, wasn't scary and the usual things you see with scary movies that aren't mainstream.
I'm glad I didn't let those reviews phase me, because I honestly liked this movie and it will remain in my collection. It may not be a movie I pop in the player a lot, but it's earned the spot amongst the rest of my horror movies.

So was it perfect, no and I feel there are some scenes that could have been better and I would have liked them to add more to the ending. Throughout the whole movie they showed flash backs that was supposed to lead up to what landed the two girls who are seeking revenge on their sorority ""friends"" in jail. Some of those included news reports of what happened after the incident, and I would have liked to see random pop ups during the credits of different news stations reporting on the after math.
I also would have loved to see more in the gore aspect, and I'm more of those that get a little squeamish during scenes of intense torture. There are scenes that made me think I was going to see some... let's say some horrific torture scenes with lots of blood. Unfortunately, you don't get to see the good stuff, just the after math of what they did.

I honestly think this is a good movie, I rank it right up there with the Sorority Row remake and other college themed horror movies.",1499644800,3,1924,4.1554959785522785

What I will say...is that this movie kept me entertained until the end and I never wanted to turn off the TV and give up on it.  If you are expecting the best horror movie of your life, don't disappoint yourself.  If you are looking for a couple hours of entertainment while you watch sorority sisters in a haunted house, go for it.",1425686400,,419,4.2

6796299,4,B00PC7BL2W,"Write & Directed by : Gavin Michael Booth

So, this sorority prank goes really,really wrong.

Now, Its 2 years later and someone is trying to undue the harm that was caused by the prank.

Haunted Houses are always great locations for Real & Reel situations of SCARE themes  & scenarios.

The film starts off like kind of MEAN GIRLS and then goes to SAW at The Prom !

The actresses are FANtastic, They absolutely are believable in their roles.

We were scared, Excited by the inventiveness of weapons, Awed by the women playing the what is usually a male type of malevolence.",1422230400,,575,4.578431372549019
6796300,2,B00PC7BL2W,"Wow, this movie was just bad all around!  So, if you're thinking what I was thinking, ""Sorority girls + B-Horror + Not Rated = REALLY good time!"", then you are in for a world of disappointment!  I'm not even sure if this movie merits going into.  But I'll do so for your benefit.  Maybe save you a few bucks?!

Sarah and Kimberly have been in prison for the past 2 years after being involved in a Sorority prank go wrong.  Upon release, they somehow build a ridiculously elaborate haunted house and lure their former ""sisters"" into coming (one at a time, mind you) as they extract their revenge.  Also, while doing so, they find it a good idea to have actual ""paying customers"" come into the house as well, albeit through a completely different door.  But all the same.

This is the movie.  One by one the girls enter the house and are ""dealt"" with.  In completely ridiculous fashion, I might add.  (as if a piece of fabric wouldn't tear before your insides were crushed?!)  The girls must be geniuses to come up with some of the stuff (powdered acid comes to mind).  And I've never seen a Sorority that only had like 7 girls in it?

I would give this a single star, but the ending (so obviously predictable) happened exactly how I thought it should, so that bumps it up a bit.  Other than than, what a giant piece this film is.

Final Verdict:  Don't bother",1421884800,2,1358,4.407258064516129
6796301,4,B00PC7BL2W,"The film is told with flashbacks. In the present Cory (Sarah Booth) and Elaina (Kimberly-Sue Murray) are torturing to death members of the Sigma Kappa Delta sorority as part of their ""Slut Cam games."" They are doing so on Halloween night in their Scarehouse. The reason why they are enacting revenge is revealed slowly in the subplot. About 50 minutes into the film you get the full basic idea minus the undeveloped immaterial twist.

There is nothing like watching a bunch of women torture each other and talk dirty. Perhaps their over use of the F-bomb, c-word and desire to have sex was the most interesting part of the film. Certainly films that rely on getting women naked would have more nudity. It doesn't. It has one quick glimpse of breasts which were most likely special effect fakes. The sex scene was just as quick, i.e. the opening of a restroom stall for a second. You can't have a successful slasher film of a sorority without three real nude scenes (Roger Corman successful norm). Even the address of the scarehouse (1635) didn't add up to 13. They even screwed that up.

Gavin Michael Booth wrote and directed this film and had his wife (Sarah Booth) star in it. 3 1/2 stars It had potential.",1421625600,2,1209,4.644859813084112
6796302,2,B00PC7BL2W,"Two young women run a surprisingly elaborate scarehouse.  The front door is for paying customers and leads to pretty much what you would expect but there is a back door where their former sorority sisters show up, they think for a party, because the two women running the house have an ulterior motive--revenge for what we eventually find out was a hazing prank that went bad.

The encounter they have with the first arriving sorority sister is fairly startling and very effective but once we know how far these women are willing to go the subsequent arrivals become more than a little repetitive, although they certainly are grisly.  The Scarehouse really could have used fewer torture scenes and more character development--it's impossible to care much one way or another about anything that happens which doesn't make for a very engaging film.

Still, a lot of craft obviously went into The Scarehouse in terms of acting and direction--the movie is slick but it isn't particularly suspenseful and the relationship between the two girls seeking revenge is too underdeveloped to generate much interest in terms of drama or dark humor.  The movie does an even worse job with the victims who generally meet their grisly ends before we find out much of anything about them.

The night that ended badly is shown in bits and pieces between the murderous set-pieces but what happened ultimately isn't interesting enough to justify drawing it out through the movie--if The Scarehouse was a classic style slasher film the hazing gone wrong would take up the first five minutes of the movie which is all it really merits--the many cutaways to the girls partying that night just feels like so much filler and no attempt is made to use the flashback footage to flesh out the personalities of the different girls--it's just a lot of swearing and drinking and swearing and drinking.

The Scarehouse is a dud because the script is crap but the actresses and director clearly have talent--there's no reason the people involved in this couldn't go on to better things but this one isn't really worth sitting through.",1421452800,,2101,4.918079096045198
6796303,3,B00PC7BL2W,"**NO SPOILERS** I found this low budget b-horror to actually be a fairly entertaining experience. I would NOT, though. recommend spending the $5.99 that Amazon is charging (as of this writing) as it's definitely not worth that much for a ticket. Having said that, the plot was a surprise and unfolded in an interesting way that made it pretty fun to follow. The acting was hit and miss, as with most b-movies, but largely decent enough not to pull me out of the film itself. It's got a touch of Saw, more than a little revenge, some pretty amusing black comedy and chick humor, and just enough blood (def not torture porn) to give gore fans just enough of a taste to keep them interested.",1421452800,3,688,4.512
6796304,4,B00PC7BL2W,"With Women in Horror Month just around the corner, The Scarehouse is the perfect movie to view. While it is made by a male director - Gavin Michael Booth - it is a great achievement for female characters in a horror flick. It showcases females torturing females, and in this case it's something we haven't seen performed so expertly before. This is a must see for torture-porn fanatics, people who love fun houses, and anyone else who enjoys a different film with a progressive plot.",1421366400,,483,4.694117647058824
6796305,4,B00PC7BL2W,"Past and Present camera work.  Fresh forms of torture (albeit, sometimes cheesy).  From a girl's perspective - they used REAL women for this film, not 80 pound silicone stuffed pixie sticks.  I'm also biased towards the theme, I love a good haunted house and the chick that rigged it was Class A - too bad she had a Class F partner-in-crime who almost ruined the film for me with her way over the top acting.  However, little nuances of this flick definitely held my attention and I think my mind is permanently stamped with a bada$$ screenshot from the ending.

Although it's definitely in the B movie club, I personally think it's fresh enough to earn 4 stars and I typically hate B Horrors.  If you love the genre as I do, you should give this a chance!",1421366400,2,756,4.442028985507246
6796306,1,B00PC7BL2W,"It's strictly based on vengeance, and though it does have a few twists, blood is spilled in abundance. I sat through the full 75 minutes, relieved it didn't keep going. I've seen better horror movies.  I will give ""good acting"" credit to the woman who played the real butcher. Other than that, a total waste.",1421280000,,308,4.6
8687358,4,B00PC7BL2W,"This movie's far from perfect, but I found it compelling. The storytelling's a bit disjointed as it constantly jumps back and forth from past to present day. I wish the plot would've just unfolded naturally in chronological order. I think that would've served audiences a lot better in the long run. The characters are a bit vapid and shallow, but that's by design. They're sorority chicks after all, not respectable geniuses. The kills aren't exceptionally gory, but I can't deny their creativity. There's some unique stuff in this movie. Like the DVD box says, ""The Best. Pillow Fight. Ever."" I'm now curious to see what else writer/director Gavin Michael Booth has worked on. If his other work is anything like The Scarehouse it'll at least provide solid entertainment (even if the stuff isn't masterpiece material).",1531699200,,819,5.074074074074074

8687360,4,B00PC7BL2W,"Not great but I did like. Actually I was hoping they'd get away with it..........is that wrong, lol. I liked the twist at the end but figured it out a second  before when she said ""I never lose bitch"" and sure enough!",1523491200,,217,4.166666666666667

8687364,5,B00PC7BL2W,The scarehouse is a very good movie. Finally they made a movie where only girls were involved.
