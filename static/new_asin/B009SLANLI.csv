5366154,5,B009SLANLI,Just an awesome eye opener. I Mr Rawal did an awesome job to show people that religion has become business,1390003200,,106,4.35
5366155,5,B009SLANLI,The movie is absolutely hilarious and the actors did a great job! It pokes great fun at modern institutionalized religion where no one thinks but follows!,1380672000,,154,4.961538461538462
5366156,5,B009SLANLI,"This movie is very funny on the surface, just the performance of Akshay Kumar as God himself is in and of itself entertaining.

Beyond the surface humor of the farce of litigating God for the disasters of our human existence, this movie has a deeper levels of the interest such as the irony of the main character, a stated atheist having to prove the existence of God to prove his case.

If that wasn't enough, the moving yet another layer deeper, OMG spends a lot of time exploring the idea of religion versus spirituality and how some religious leaders (from all over the globe and from every religion) are more about collecting followers and the dollars of the followers than following the teachings of their God.

Finally, the last layer was my favorite: God, viewed through whichever spiritual lens, is still the same God. Different religions have different prophets and different ways of following and communicating with God; ultimately, God is God. Very philosophical for a Bollywood flick.",1374364800,3,997,4.9226190476190474

5366158,1,B009SLANLI,"forced to watch by wife. meaningful theme. prolonged beyond tolerance. while majority of religious leaders in India are portrayed in bad light, it is also true that there are many genuine religious leaders. but as a movie, it is a bore .",1364083200,,237,4.666666666666667
5366159,5,B009SLANLI,"Paresh Rawal( Kanji Bhai) is a sharp businessman who unfortunately loses his place of business in an earthquake. The insurance company refuses to settle his claim stating that this was an act of God thus cant be covered by insurance. Desperate, Kanji decides to file a case against God and the insurance company and thereby enraging his community and holy men. OMG raises hell and how..
This film is based on the Gujarati play, Kanji Viruddh Kanji, which was made in Hindi as Krishan versus Kanhaiya. As the film unfolds, Kanji confronts the holy god men who he thinks are the collection agents for God and the temples serving as places of business. Lord Krishna (Akshay Kumar) decides to step in and do something about the mess that has engulfed Kanji.
Akshay Kumar as Krishna Vasudev Yadav is amazing as the modern incarnate of the playful God. Akshay needs to applauded for standing on the sidelines and let the other actors take over in a film which was produced by him. Almost all of the Godmen are fashioned on their real life couterparts, Govind Namdeo as the bald religious preacher is evil and full of double standards. Mithun Chakraborty is the effeminate spiritual guru that leads the band of holy leaders. The female holy woman is played by Poonam Jhaver. Paresh Rawal steals the show and runs with it briliiantly, he gets to deliver some of the best lines of 2012- Yeh log mujhe (Bhagavad) Gita sikhayenge? In logon ki IQ bhi room temperature se low hai.' The actor shows remarkable acting and it is heartening to see that Paresh Rawal getting more camera time than Akshay Kumar. A great fim and could easily be one of the best films of 2012. Five stars. 12/12/13",1362268800,5,1676,4.684745762711865

5366161,5,B009SLANLI,"This movie is funny and loving. It reminds us that Jesus probably wouldn't wear a Rolex if He came back. The movie shows our relationship with the Lord is personal and doesn't necessarily need someone to intercede for us. Whether the viewer is Hindu, Muslim or Christian, thy should find it amusing.",1359072000,,299,4.769230769230769

8544109,5,B009SLANLI,"Christians, don't turn your nose up at this movie. You may learn something very valuable. I know I did. Brilliantly written & performed, very complex. Pay attention to the subtle words ""God"" says. God has ways of getting our attention. Sometimes it's a gentle breeze & sometimes it's an earthquake.
I had shared my opinion of this movie with family & friends before purchasing it. I encouraged them all to see it because it illustrated what faith & believing is about so eloquently. It may soon become a family tradition because it is just that moving & spiritually uplifting.",1426550400,,576,4.828282828282828
