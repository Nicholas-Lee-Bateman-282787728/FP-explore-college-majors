664312,4,6303490999,"I loved this movie as a kid and I still love it now.  Despite not having Harryhausen quality dinosaur effects, for the time, the effects are generally pretty good.  Definitely better than the effects featured in many other movies of that type of the time and way above those in ""At The Earth's Core"".  The acting is pretty good all around, especially the German captain and his sneering first mate, Dietz.  And of course, no film of this type would be complete without the incomparable Doug McClure!
This movie really imparts an excellent sense of adventure as both a war drama and a fight for survival in the lost world of Caprona.  They aren't stingy with the dinosaurs either as the sequel, 'The People That Time Forgot' is.  All in all, this is a fun movie that really captures the essence of what dinosaur films of the current period like the Jurassic Park sequels are missing - a sense of adventure and a soul.",1050192000,2,916,4.554878048780488
664313,4,6303490999,"It is rather amazing that having used Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes for dozens of movies over the course of almost the entire century, Hollywood finally went back to ERB's novels to find another property for a film and ignored the John Carter of Mars series and went for ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" a rather second-rate potboiler.  But if you forgive the cheap special effects (be kind, it is a 1975 film) this is not a bad adventure story.  Burroughs basically wrote his own version of ""The Lost World"" as a German U-Boat sinks a British ship whose crew manages to take over the submarine.  Traveling to South America they find a lost continent where there are dinosaurs and cavemen (ergo, ""The Land That Time Forgot""), neither of whom has any respect for civilized human beings.
Doug McClure stars as American adventurer Bowen Tyler in this British production.  McClure and director Kevin Connor would make two other similar films based on Burroughs novels, ""At the Earth's Core,"" from the more ambitious Pelucidar series and a sequel to this film ""The People That Time Forgot.""  Along for the ride are the beautiful and brainy biologist in distress, Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon), U-Boat Captain Von Schoenvorts (John McEnery) and his cunning second in command Deitz (Anthony Ainley), along with a savy Brit named Bradley (Keith Barron) who manages to be put off by being eaten by the dinosaurs longer than most of his mates.  Of course not only do these people have to watch out for dinosaurs and cavemen, they have to watch out for each other.  ""The Land That Time Forgot"" is a film that teaches its young British audience that even during World War I when the Germans were not Nazis you still could not trust them.
The story is basic adventure, with Tyler and company facing one peril after another.  The script is decent, given the going ons; Michael Morcock worked on the script along with James Cawthorn, so there is an inherent assumption that all of the good stuff belongs to the noted fantasy writer.  There is an attempt to get into some of ERB's reasoning for the existence of ""Caprona,"" as the lost continent is called, but it only muddles the film until the action gets going again.  The cast takes the situation seriously, which is a prerequisite in any film like this, but while the action is above average the special effects are tacky.  The dinosaurs are laughable and the miniatures are not much better.  Still, you get an indication of how much fun the action-adventures elements are (for this particular genre and this particular time) when the film still gets 4 stars despite the hokey dinosaurs.",1044230400,11,2634,4.777533039647577
664314,5,6303490999,"Whenever I read reviews in movie guides I am saddened to see this film is given a hard time.  Alright, so the dinosaurs aren't Harryhausen/Jurassic Park fare, but they're certainly a lot better than most other low-budget dinosaur/monster movies of their time (or since then, for that matter).  A group of shipwrecked WW1 navymen board and take over the German U-boat which sunk their vessel.  Before long, however, they are hopelessly lost, are forced to co-operate as they come across a lost island.
What really makes this film stand out is its superb atmosphere, its sense of drama, its believable characters, its well-staged battle sequences (both human and prehistoric), and its storyline involving an island as a living thing.  A real classic, and one in the eye for those who scoff at the British film industry.",1036886400,6,817,4.985294117647059
664315,4,6303490999,"I can remember when I was seven years old and in love with dinosaurs, I thought The Land that Time Forgot was the greatest thing in the world. Now, as an almost fourteen year old film student (self-proclaimed), my opinions have somewhat changed.
The action sequences are spectacular (Particularly the various ship versus ship battles and the volcanic eruption). The prehistoric sets and the sets of the submarine are also very well made and convincing. However, the dinosaur effects aren't just convincing enough. This is especially with the recent C.G.I effects used in dinosaur films today. However it is clear that this is because of the low budget and not because the cast and crew had no talent.
But everything considered, I found this to be a fun, enjoyable movie I will watch whenever it is broadcasted on television. But, even despite the low cost, I would think before I purchase it. Unless, that is, it was a Special Edition DVD version (Hint Hint).",996969600,8,959,4.853658536585366
664316,4,6303490999,"No, the dinosaur effects are not Jurassic Park and yes you can see the strings on the pterodactyl, but other than that this is a great flick.  Had they been provided Harryhausen effects, this would be an all time classic.  Everything other that the dinosaur effects are a bullseye.  Gotta give Doug Mcclure some credit as a likeable enough hero. Great acting, good story and believable characters make for an awesome 90 minute diversion.  The first 40 minutes when the sub and battleship battle looks great.  I have always loved this flick and it's sequel, The People That Time Forgot.  Widescreen DVD, anyone?  Perhaps a double feature DVD with both parts?  Wouldn't that be nice....",973814400,6,684,4.886956521739131
664317,5,6303490999,"This film is about British ship survivors, lead by Doug McClure, who join  a German WW1 submarine crew (who sunk their civilian ship) to discover a  prehistoric land in the South Pole. The special effects are good, with  different caveman, dinosaurs, sea monsters, and flying reptiles. The sub  abandoning McClure and Susan Penhaglion on the land whilst an earthquake  and volcano destroy the place, but the sub explodes whilst escaping.

664319,5,6303490999,"McClure was my first favorite actor ever, because of TV's ""The Virginian"". This is the best of the adventure movies he did with director Connor in the mid-70's, followed closely by ""Warlords Of  Atlantis"". If it's possible to have something like an eternal crush on  a movie; this is the one for me !. It'll always be a great pleasure to take  yet another trip to the island of Caprona, with McClure & Co.  O.k.,  the special effects may look dated and aren't Ray Harryhausen stop motion  animation mastery, but so what ?. -That's only part of its very charm. And  sure, the budget may also be a lot lower than, say, Disney's ""Island  At The Top Of The World"" (made the same year), but you'll love it if  you're young at heart. By the way, if there ever was a cult-classic in  desperate need of restoration and letterboxing; this is the one indeed,  folks.",941846400,9,856,4.458064516129032

7848720,4,6303490999,"Released in 1974 and directed by Kevin Connor, The Land that Time Forgot is an adventure flick based on Edgar Rice Burroughs book: A German sub during WWI sinks a British ship, but some survivors commandeer the U-boat whereupon there are tensions amidst the two factions. After taking a wrong turn, the sub comes to an unknown land, which they discover is Caprona, a land where dinosaurs and primitive people dwell. Can they ever get back to civilization?

John McEnery plays Captain Von Schoenvorts while the English girl, Lisa, is played by cutie Susan Penhaligon, a biologist. The two have an interesting discussion over the German conduct in the Great War. Lisa observes that Von Schoenvorts is a sophisticated, respectable man, which sparks her to inquire of his brutal war actions.  The Captains Germanic contention is that Lisa is naive considering that ""life is founded upon killing and destruction"" and ""the sea is teeming with living things that prey upon one another to survive."" Say what you will about the dinosaur puppets, but this is some pretty heavy stuff for an adventure flick appealing mostly to youths. The Captains second in command, Dietz (Anthony Ainley), more fits the stereotype that Lisa projects on Von Schoenvorts. Actually, the Captain is the wise father figure.

The British are portrayed in a diplomatic, pragmatic manner (Keith Barron, amongst others). But its the American, Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), whos the brash, masculine hero. Hes essentially boorish but Lisa cant help but be attracted to him even while she has more mental affinity with Von Schoenvorts, the suave, but maybe-too-old sophisticate.

This was a British production and the dubious dinosaur effects are noticeably inferior to Hammers stop-motion effects used in 1966s One Million Years BC. But if you can embrace their quaintness or ignore their cheesiness, The Land that Time Forgot is a surprisingly decent adventure, almost in the same league as 1954s 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, at least as far as ship-going adventure and worthy mindfood go; plus it lacks the hokey Disney-isms of that movie.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot at Canary Islands and Scotland with studio work done in England.

7848722,2,6303490999,"This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of ""Voyage to the Earth's Core"" and ""Mysterious Island"". I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp ""Ogar"" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers.

7848723,4,6303490999,"Fun movie. It is a flashback for me and I wanted my son to see them. They all acted so seriously while guys with big foam dinosaur heads were bashing them - as seen on the box cover.  Doug McClure made a few of these movies and they were fun. And for no discernible reason I could see other than some cool special effects, they shot (er, blow up) some dinosaurs using the submarines cannon.

The three species of humans was fun too, this idea of rapid evolution.  Sounds painful though.

Anyway, great fun and even younger kids can watch it as it is not like many gore filled movies seen today.",1313020800,,594,4.276785714285714

I'm sure in 30 years people will laugh at the effects in JP #3 and say a kid could do better graphics on their toy PC...........anyway, I'm nostalgic.
I remember seeing this movie as a kid and I thought it was HUGE.  What a cool story!  A lost unknown island in the Antarctic, where dinosaurs still live and time bends, the people trying to survive and then getting trapped.....losing contact with the outside world, possibly for the rest of their lives.  We sure don't see that kind of excitement in Central IL.  You wont' find this one at any video store though, it's gone the way of its dinosaurs.  Cool addition to any B movie collection.

7848728,5,6303490999,"As one other reviewer put it, I love to pay a visit to Caprona!  I loved these movies in the 70's.  In the eighties, an artistic producer at an independent station in Miami would show both The Land That Time Forgot and The People That Time Forgot on consecutive Saturday and Sunday late nights! Bring out the Pizza!  In addition to the atmospheric qualities of the sets and settings of these two films (much of which is on-location) they have another timeless quality:  excellent music.  Land Time Forgot has a distinctive moody tone to its score.  People Time Forgot has a dynamic opening and closing theme which is used re-currently throughout the film.  Doug McClure is perfect as Bowen Tyler, and yes, he is in the sequel, which anchors the two films perfectly.  Supporting casts in both films are excellent, and hey! I thought the dinosaurs were great!  The submarine special effects are worthy of Derrick Meddings, and the Amphibian Plane effects in the sequel are equally impressive.  The ""Forgot"" part of the titles are eloquently staged in ""Land"" when the submarine steams upriver; and in ""People"" when the pilot, Hogan, starts to go stir-crazy back at the Amphibian campsite.  BTW, Patrick Wayne and Sarah Douglas shine in the sequel as much as our heroes do in the first flick.  I agree with others:  It's time for these two to come out in wide-screen DVD--preferrably together!  One more note:  READ THE BOOKS!  They are available separately or together.  And surprise! They are actually a trilogy:  The Land That Time Forgot, The People That Time Forgot, and Out Of Time's Abyss.  Thanks, Mr. Burroughs!",1086912000,3,1616,4.853479853479853
