8637442,5,B00HZ7NZS0,"I had bought the first two volumes of the book set. I've read the first one and have been researching Silat for a while. I've had the interest to complement the experience I have with Combat Ju-Jutsu. So, when I found the DVDs I had to get the first one and I must say that after scanning through it I will start to brake it down by sections to start practicing this instructors methods and approach to Silat. I like his way of teaching and applications to the street. I recommend this DVD. I will follow up with the next volumes. You must be patient and take one section at a time and practice.",1400803200,7,595,4.228070175438597
8637443,5,B00HZ7NZS0,"I have been peripherally (a nice way to say lazily) involved with PSP since roughly 2003-2004ish and this DVD is a long awaited reorganization of the Level 1 Curriculum for Pencak Silat Pertempuran (PSP). The basic tenets of the art seem to be communicated in a more cohesive manner and the production values are higher. You can really see the effort and work that Guru Stark has put into organizing the material and making it more accessible to the new practitioner.

Part of the work that has been put into the way that the art is presented is the reorganization of the numbering system for technique and positioning which separates it from a lot of systems and serves the practitioner as a Combat Positioning System which allows reference points to quickly be found in the midst of movement.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in learning more about Silat and Fighting.",1393804800,6,893,4.754838709677419
