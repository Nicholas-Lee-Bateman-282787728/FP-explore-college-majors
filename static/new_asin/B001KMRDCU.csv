This is a 1985 production from the folks at Harmony Gold (the people who brought you Robotech and ""Shaka Zulu,"" among many other fine programs). It runs 90 minutes, is animated and appears to have been produced for a Spanish-speaking market (based on the fact that all of the signs in the cartoons are in Spanish). Composer Hector Villa-Lobos had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with this production (seeing as he had been dead for over two decades at the time).

Here is a plot summary from the back of the box: ""THE LITTLE TRAIN takes us to fantasy land where we visit some of the favorite children's stories, such as Little Red Riding Hood, The Little Soldier [it's actually The Steadfast Tin Soldier] and the Three Little Pigs, accompanied by a host of entertaining characters, among them a family of rabbits who behave like humans, a lion who thinks he's a rabbit, and a villainous wolf that causes all kinds of trouble.""",1319500800,3,1089,4.637305699481865
