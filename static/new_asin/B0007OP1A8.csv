8049571,1,B0007OP1A8,"Precious little excitement in this dreary low-budget serial. Film historian William K. Everson once wrote that the publicity stills from ""Custer's Last Stand"" (1936) contained more action than the entire chapterplay. A good ""B Western"" cast is the sole redeeming feature, but cannot alleviate 15 episodes of boredom.",1366329600,2,316,5.604166666666667
8049572,5,B0007OP1A8,"The battle was over ""faster than a man could light a pipe,"" said one who was there, Arapaho warrior, Water Man. ""The soldiers were entirely surrounded and the whole country was alive with Indians, thousands of Indians  --- Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho.
""The soldiers were armed with single-shot rifles. The Indians on horseback had shields and rode on the side of their horses in a way the soldiers could not hit them. Crazy Horse, the Sioux chief, the bravest man I ever saw, rode closest to the soldiers yelling at them, daring them to shoot him. All of the soldiers were shooting at him, but he was never hit.
""Once I saw Custer. He was dressed in buckskins. It was almost at the end of the fight. He was standing alone with his pistols in his hands.""
Said Crazy Horse: ""We did not ask you white men to come here, The Great Spirit gave us this country as a home. You had yours. We did not interfere with you. But soldiers came, destroyed our homes, our villages. Then Long Hair (Custer) came.
""They say we massacred Custer and his soldiers, but they would have massacred us if we had not defended ourselves.""",1356652800,,1107,4.507462686567164
8049573,2,B0007OP1A8,"The concept of ""Custer's Last Stand"" was such an iconic phrase in America, similar to ""Remember the Alamo,"" that the producers tried to build a story around it figuring the title alone would pull the kids into the theater.  This was one of only three serials produced by Stage & Screen Productions, before they went bust during the Depression.  If serials were measured by the size of the cast or their length, this would be a 10.  There are 62 actors, the first chapter lasts an amazing 40 minutes, and the rest of it seems to go on forever.

As you can probably guess, this serial has very little to do with General Custer.  He's the commandant of the fort and puts in an occasional appearance, while most of the action happens between the nearby settlers and the local Indians until the very end.  The thin story line involves a sacred arrow which will reveal the location of a cave full of gold, and who has the arrow--all to kill time until they can get to the battle to justify the title.  Needless to say, the arrow changes hands constantly.  And we never even get to see the cave it represents!  The acting is generally terrible--they look like they're rehearsing for a play in junior high school.  Apparently they never re-shot a scene in order to save time and film, so we have to watch while the actors seem to be trying to remember their lines, ad-libbing much of the time, and fluffing many of the lines they do remember.  It's painful to sit through the whole thing, so I confess I did a bit of fast-forwarding.  There are many story lines intersecting throughout the film, only a couple of which are fully developed, thus adding to the confusion.

Rex Lease (The Clutching Hand, Lone Ranger Rides Again, Daredevils of the West) is General Custer's chief scout, Kit Cardigan.  Three different women vie for his attention, none of whom had much success in serials or elsewhere in movies.  The cast is loaded with apparently genuine Native Americans, headed by Chief Thundercloud (Tonto in the Lone Ranger serials), as well as High Eagle, Howling Wolf, and Iron Eyes Cody.  Historical characters such as Buffalo Bill, Calamity Jane, and Wild Bill Hickock wander through occasionally, but they don't add much.  Well-known serial bad-guy George Chesebro is quite effective as a disgraced Army lieutenant who redeems himself bigtime in the final battle.  The battle itself is not bad, reinacted pretty much as people picture it from the famous painting.  You won't miss much if you just watch Chapters 1, 13, 14, and 15.",1341014400,5,2529,4.706818181818182
8049574,4,B0007OP1A8,"story line you really had to follow put together not bad
overall i enjoyed it.  chapters followed each other quite well",1245974400,3,119,4.666666666666667
8049575,4,B0007OP1A8,"WEISS PRODUCTIONS (owned by Louis Weiss) was a small independent studio with a total cliffhanger output of three (all released in 1936). CUSTER'S LAST STAND was the first of these.

Outdoor scenes for LAST STAND were filmed at Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park (Agua Dulce, CA. - a far cry and distance from South Dakota). Unlike most serials, LAST STAND has several lead characters and storylines that unfold during its 15 episodes. The central theme here (if there is one) is a red herring: the search for an arrow containing directions to a mineral-rich cave-- a cave that we never see. Along the way we do meet some of the Old West's more renowned characters. The topper of course is the 7th Cavalry's ill-fated battle of Little Big Horn.

LAST STAND trivia:

George Custer was a brevetted brigadier general during the Civil War-- a temporary position. When the Union Army was reduced in size after the war, Custer was also reduced to a lieutenant colonel, the rank he held at the time of his death 13 years later.

Sixty-two actors appeared in LAST STAND (23 were uncredited). The cast was packed with Native Americans such as: White Feather, Tall Tree, Swift Eagle, Red Star, Lone Pine, Little Eagle, Humming Bird, etc.

One man listed as (and believed to be) an Indian was Iron Eyes Cody (Chief Brown Fox). Cody was actually the son of Italian immigrant parents. He denied this even in court in 1996, when his heritage was challenged. Cody's most famous role was his briefest: he was the Indian who sheds a tear for a blighted American environment in ""Keep America Beautiful"" ads that ran from 1971 into the 1980s.

Young Marty Joyce (Buzz/town fool) was killed in a car wreck shortly after this film was completed.

Stuntman-extraordinaire Yakima Canutt starred in a few silent-era westerns. He was also at times an assistant director, production coordinator, writer and stunt coordinator on dozens of great films. Here, Canutt has a minor role as an Indian.

Robert Walker was a silent screen star whose career deteriorated in the sound era to playing uncredited bit parts-- he did so for a quarter century.

Chief Thundercloud was of Cherokee/Scotch/Irish/German heritage. The title of ""Chief"" was honorary. Thundercloud created the role of Tonto in two late-1930s LONE RANGER serials. He also was the title character in GERONIMO (1939).

Chief John Big Tree's likeness appears on the Indian head nickel. He was a full-blooded Seneca Indian. (Big Tree portrays a medicine man here.)

8049576,4,B0007OP1A8,"A pretty good western I ended up watching again and again. George Chesebro, usually seen in lesser roles as a bad guy, steals the show here in a most heroic way and even tugs at the ol' heartstrings. Another big plus was the casting of a number of Arapaho Indian survivors of the actual Little Bighorn battle. That moved ""Custer's Last Stand"" w-a-a-y up on my list of must-have serials.",1155168000,9,386,4.5285714285714285
