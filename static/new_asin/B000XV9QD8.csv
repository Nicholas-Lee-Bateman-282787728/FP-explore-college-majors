8229998,5,B000XV9QD8,"I am an-on again, off-again photographer and I have never experienced a instructional video as comprehensive, imaginative and easy to follow as Joe DiMaggio's and JoAnne Kalish's ""Sights Unseen"" video.  After viewing, I spent three days using the insights that Joe and JoAnne talked about in the video and I have never shot more exciting and fascinating photos since I first picked up a camera.  I have recommended ""Sights Unseen"" to family and friends who are interested in bringing their photographs up to spectacular level.",1223164800,,526,5.176470588235294
8229999,5,B000XV9QD8,"This DVD gave me a whole new outlook on both digital photography and Venice. I've been using a digital camera for years but felt that I wasn't getting the best results from my camera or my efforts. This DVD has helped me tremendously to optimize my results; I've watched it a number of times as I keep getting more and more out of it. The hosts really make things clear and simple, which makes what they teach easy to implement. Also, I know Venice pretty well but am now chomping at the bit to get back there. It's such a stunning and rare city and is so beautifully represented by the hosts' pictures that I can't wait to get there to make my own photographs. I highly recommend this DVD - it's truly a bargain for all it delivers.",1199577600,,733,4.280575539568345
8230000,5,B000XV9QD8,"I really enjoyed watching Sights Unseen.  I recommend buying the DVD for 2 reasons:  First, I really enjoyed seeing Joe's interpretation of Venice. His work is excellent, and really captures the essence of the special light that's found throughout Venice.

Second, Sights Onseen invites the viewer to learn from pro photographers Joe DiMaggio and JoAnne Kalish on some of the finer points of destination photography.  One of the main points tells how a working Pro ""sees"" multiple opportunities within a small area.  Joe goes into detail on constantly looking, ""seeing"" and making small but important variations on a subject. Often it's this variety that makes the difference between a great image and a mediocre one.",1195862400,,717,5.2
8230001,5,B000XV9QD8,"I really enjoyed this DVD! I have attended a few of their workshops in the past and this DVD brought me the chance of experiencing another one, this time in Venice!  The dvd helped reinforce some techniques that they taught me and introduce whole new concepts! The short segment where Joe walks back and forth down an alley shooting 10-12 differnt types of shots was well worth the cost of the DVD! And that was only a tiny portion of the whole DVD.  Check out the extra section also.  The New York Workshop preview gives a great tip on shooting the Statue of Liberty in a way that I know I can use again and again on other shots!",1195689600,,630,4.277310924369748
8230002,4,B000XV9QD8,"I really enjoyed this DVD as both an avid photographer and a lover of Venice.
The photographic teachings, tips and guidance was brilliantly simple and useful.
My next visit to Venice - and other exotic destinations - will definately be seen through a more colorful and eciting eye.",1195430400,,281,4.875
