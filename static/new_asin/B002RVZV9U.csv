3976409,5,B002RVZV9U,"Caught this film yesterday and all I can say is wow. If you like music, guitars or any combination of the two catch this one on the big screen. Then you can easily decide if you need to add this dvd to your music archives. The progression of stories and how they are told is excellent, as well as the music presented. [...]

I came here yesterday after getting home from the matinee to see if there might be a ""soundtrack"" available to accompany this movie. There's probably enough material here (Link Wray, Son House etc.) to make a sweet multi-disc collection. It may seem like an odd combination of guitar players, but all three are well represented and there are too many highlights to mention. Seeing these guys playing bottleneck slide guitar together on ""In My Time Of Dying"" is worth the price of admission by itself. Seeing this film was a joyful experience for me and my heart does a little happy dance just thinking about it.",1252540800,93,936,4.538461538461538
3976410,4,B002RVZV9U,"A wonderful rock-u-mentary that allows the viewer seemingly sincere moments with three world-class guitarists as they discuss their early influences, guitars, and performing.  They trade licks, stories, and play a sweet tune together.  None of those annoying interviews with former managers/girlfriends/historians - just the musicians.

An excellent choice for electric guitarists, Zep/U2/Jack White fans - invite your spouses/friends with care.",1250208000,39,445,6.383333333333334

3976449,1,B002RVZV9U,"Very disappointed. Should have been called ""It Might get Boring"". If you like Jack White then by all means buy it but if you are a life long Jimmy Page fan you are better off with The Song Remains the Same. Would have rather just seen Jimmy playing in his living room.",1506902400,,268,4.173076923076923
3976450,4,B002RVZV9U,I saw this on AXIS tv station and loved it. Glad I was able to order same thing. Going to buy another as a gift.,1506211200,,112,3.52
3976471,5,B002RVZV9U,"Though it was intended to be a documentary about guitars and guitar players in general, it's more of a focus on Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White. The Edge seems to be the odd man out here, in a way, since his style of playing is not blues based and seems less ""organic"" that that of Page and White. That said, even the segments featuring the Edge are entertaining (though I can't stand U2).

I would prefer much more from Jimmy Page. I could have been just two hours of Page playing and talking about guitars and his musical influences, as far as I (and many others) are concerned. Jack White is a decent enough guitar player (though I personally think a bit over rated) Still, it's good to see blues based music being employed by younger generations. His segments are more colorful and animated.

Overall I really enjoy the film, especially the out takes. Page giving the boys a lesson on Kashmir is worth the price of admission.",1505606400,,933,4.482352941176471

3976474,5,B002RVZV9U,"This is absolute gold. I am a really big fan of Led Zeppelin, U2 and all of Jack White's bands and solo work, so this was like a dream come true to see these guys together, swapping stories, and just jamming on their favorite guitars. Many parts I went back and played again. Jack White is completely amazing and of course Page is the master. He can still jam it out at age 70-plus. I loved the cover of The Band's ""The Weight"" at the end, wish I could buy that as a single.

I loved seeing Jack with (I guess?) his 9-year old nephew who looks just like him, so adorable. I loved hearing the stories from Jimmy, Edge & Jack about their influences and origins of their bands. I think for any guitar buff you will really enjoy all the technical talk about amps, guitars, etc. I wish they had shown more of Jack White's guitar solos though!

I was a bit upset that I paid to watch this and it did not come with any of the extras; I had to watch those on YouTube. Include all the extras, Amazon!! Some of the extras/deleted scenes were even better than scenes in the movie.

I'm not only glad I watched this, but I'm so happy that this event even happened, that it's like this beautiful moment in history that those three guys I admire so much got together to hang out and jam.",1504915200,,1273,4.187755102040816
3976475,5,B002RVZV9U,Do not miss this movie if you have not already seen it - a great rockumentary!,1504569600,,78,3.9375

3976477,3,B002RVZV9U,"For some reason my copy didn't have 'Kashmir' and I don't know why. It was my main reason for buying the DVD, so I'm disappointed to say the least. The Edge sections are interesting and I love Jimmy Page, but I can't stand Jack White, don't get him at all, don't see the talent. They should've chosen someone else to join the trio.",1502150400,,331,4.26984126984127
3976478,5,B002RVZV9U,Even if one isn't a huge fan of one or all three of them it's still a well made and interesting film.  If one likes or loves one of the three then it's worth the price.  Anybody who loves either two of the three or all of them likely would be over the moon while viewing it.  Even the scenes featuring these guys improvising each other's material all at once are fun to watch.,1500249600,,376,4.054054054054054
3976479,4,B002RVZV9U,"I loved this movie. 5 stars if they had chosen anyone other than The Edge. Jimmy Page, Jack White and anyone, and I mean anyone else would have been better. The Edge can't carry Jimmy and Jack's luggage, let alone hold a candle to their playing. Having said that, The Edge made Jack and Jimmy seem even cooler which is probably why they put him in. This movie exposes The Edge as the one riff fraud that he is. Jack and Jimmy were great. If you play the guitar (or anything else for that matter), you'll probably enjoy this one.",1499212800,,528,4.29

3976494,5,B002RVZV9U,"Just watched this on a Direct TV channel and I'm still in complete awe that 72 year old Jimmy Page, this old cat isn't ready for a rocking chair just yet. The only thing missing was a 5th of JD, but I'm quite sure there was quite a bit of things being passed around off camera. But just as I thought my music has passed to whatever they call it now, it's good to see that Blues, mixed in with a little old fashioned kick ass rock n roll, is still is cool . Because this kind of music doesn't have to prove a damn thing to anyone. A 72 year old man is still Kickin ass even all of today's American Idol are barely hanging on to there dying careers. With Jack White fairly young, this music won't be phased out any time soon,,,",1492300800,,725,4.006896551724138

Three guitarist from different eras get together to talk shop and share personal insight on their techniques and careers. No, this isn't a how to video, it's so much more. I grew up on Zeppelin and am a huge Jack White fan.  I'm not so much into U2 but was intrigued by the Edge's use of effects and technology. Seems I'm more old school. It was great to see where these gentlemen originated from and journey with them from kids with a passion and a dream to the ranks of stardom.  If you are a fan of any one of the three or just a fan of the guitar you won't be disappointed.",1486080000,,642,4.211382113821138

3976542,4,B002RVZV9U,"I purchased this ages ago, but just found this link for posting a review;
It is a great film, but not what I expected... I highly doubt it got loud at all in that stage - whereas these 3 musical icons met for the first time to swap stories and licks. I could have watched the Jimmy Page segments exclusively; whereas the Edge's licks a downright boring - even though I am a big fan of the band. He produces a 'sonic soundscape' rather than a jammable catalogue of material. Jack Black on the other hand is quite the virtuoso it seems; this film opened my eyes to how good of a composer and musician he actually is. I would have rather this movie was called ""The Black Page"", and just featured the two of them jamming together - with the possibility of it getting loud... i.e. a wall of Marshall amps, with the Film Crew adorning eye plugs.",1484524800,2,839,4.283018867924528

3976544,5,B002RVZV9U,Love this movie. Interesting glimpse into the style and inspiration behind three very different musicians who all come at the instrument in completely different ways.

It gave me a whole new appreciation for the music, much like watching Amadeus gave me more appreciation for Mozart.  When it finished, I wanted more.  I wish this would be made into a series, following around more musicians.",1479168000,,392,4.63768115942029

3976705,5,B002RVZV9U,Probably the best ROCKUMENTARY ever made. I have a new respect for Jack White. Jimmy's a GOD....the Edge....not really a guitarist...more of a sound architect.

1. Jack White as an apprentice upholsterer.
2. Jimmy Page recalling that his work as a session musician somehow found him literally recording elevator music, and another time seriously considering quitting music altogether.
3. The Edge talking about the economic and political grimness of Ireland and Dublin in the 70'.",1429574400,,542,5.101123595505618

I thought to myself how freaking cool it would be to have been a fly on the wall when this film was shot. I love the opening with Jack White as he puts together a one string slide guitar and he plays to a field of cows priceless. Then there's the discovery of how to play classic Led Zeppelin songs. I love the part where Jimmy Page pays homage to Link Wray. Not to be left out The Edge shares some of his guitar parts that gave U-2 it's over all sound.

And the thing I liked the most about this 'rockumentary' was the obvious admiration The Edge and Jack White showed for Jimmy Page. I know I might get a few arguments (mostly from those who didn't live it) saying Page isn't the greatest rock guitarist ever, but it's a very short list that he is on!

I could see and hear so much of Page in both The Edge and Jack White's playing styles! Like him or not Page was a true pioneer in what would ultimately become Hard Rock. And even he gives credit where credit is due, putting the Blues Legends on the pedestal they deserved (along with Elvis Presley's inspiration), and creating a sound as yet unheard of in music...the Rock Guitar God!!!!",1405814400,,890,4.45398773006135

What It does have is a profile of each musician.  Both ""Edge"" and Jack White are clearly influenced by Page but take that influence in completely different directions.  Edge is obsessed with effects and clearly sees that as part of his sound.  White has taken a minimalist route to the point of actually using distressed instruments.

Also a treat for Page and Zep fans as it shows his early directions and some rare LZ footage.",1399248000,,614,4.495495495495495

Not only do you get to see these 3 amazing artists talk shop about their favorite guitars, but it starts to branch off into mini-documentaries about each one of them, its almost like a 3-in-1 kind of documentary.

3977057,3,B002RVZV9U,"Jimmy Page, Jack White & The Edge?  WTF!!!  Why The Edge?  This documentary had the oportunity to be so much.  The Edge killed it.  Don't get me wrong.....The Edge is in one of the worlds biggest bands, has sold millions of records and has tons of fans but he is not cut of the same cloth!  Jimmy & Jack are the blues type who can play a song that is never played the same way twice.....they are at home playing a cigar box guitar or cheap piece of Japanese plastic and make it sing.......they can get as basic as it gets and make wonderful music.  The Edge cannot do that and is only about electronics and effects.  They are different.  I don't like all of Jack Whites music but the stuff I do like is amazing.....he is pushing the envelope and trying new things like puitting piano strings on his guitar.  He is constantly innovating just like Jimmy was in his heyday.  There are so many other talented musicians that could have been the third guy here!!
Still a good movie but could have been a 5 star instead of 3.  I hate referring to someone as ""The Edge""!!",1387929600,4,1063,4.28643216080402

3977059,3,B002RVZV9U,Some real insightful stories. I think if you are a real fan of these musicians you will like. I am more of a Jack White fan so his segments were what interested me the most.

3977060,5,B002RVZV9U,"First off it makes me cringe when reading some reviews here from people who claim they know music, rock 'n roll, and the guitar but don't ""get"" Jack White. For those who think he does not belong in this film, or Edge for that matter, it's time to catch up. Rock and Roll has moved on since 1975 or so when PAGE was at the height of his power, and many players and bands have come and gone since. If you cannot understand Jack White and his POV you need to move on and catch up not with what is trendy and hip, but with what has been happening in rock since punk rock broke all those years ago. Rock 'n Roll is not just about ""guitar gods"" and hero worship and remembering how great things ""used to be"" in rock. Things have been pretty great all along and to suggest one guitarist here is unworthy of another is rubbish. All three of these gentlemen have talent all their own and come from different generations. The film shows evolution and growth and the passing down of music, tradition, and playing the guitar from generation to generation. And that is something any fan of rock 'n roll and the blues should be able to appreciate. Understand him or not Jack White is a unique talent and artist and he does not need to be like Jimmy Page or Edge to be valid as such. He plays pretty good, too. He and Edge come from punk rock. Understand that and you will ""get it.""

The film itself is a fantastic look at how three young men got started playing their instruments, their evolution with the guitar in the early years, and how they became creative with the instrument instead of being ""just a guitarist."" At some point each had to decide to step up and out front and make music, not just play music. And it's fascinating to follow each musician as they move down the road to where they are today.

We see how they came about their own sound and style of playing, learn of their influences, frustrations, and early doubts about making a real go of being a musician. It's a movie about the guitar, guitar players, the creative process, and love of rock, blues, and music in general. In Edge's and Jack's case it is also a story of punk rock. But punk is lost on some Page fans who view this film and that is a shame, because this is not a movie about hero worship or musical genre, exactly. It's simply about three interesting guitar players and Jimmy Page is one of them. He also happens to be interested in and respectful of the other two musicians here.

If you like rock 'n roll and the electric guitar and won't wet your pants just because Jimmy Page is on screen, you will like this film immensely. It is smart, well made, well told, and the music is great. It looks fantastic on Blu-Ray and the bonus material is very nice. It is not a movie about how great these players are. Its a film about music, the guitar, and creativity as seen through the eyes of three very talented, interesting, and experienced musicians with somewhat unique approaches to their instrument. And if you watch it clear of bias, hype, and hero worship, you will find much to like here and maybe even a little to learn.

Jimmy is like wine-- he only gets better (and cooler) with age. I found it to be a great insightful look into what drives and motivates them as guitarists and artists.  3 very distinct styles that came together for one film. The best parts are when they are all sitting together, listening to each other play a riff and joining in or just watching the look on a genius' face as he is inspired by another genius. I also enjoyed the trips back in time to see how each got his start. Very impressed by Jack White, who is kind of the ""black sheep"" but makes you smile.

3977113,4,B002RVZV9U,"The bottom line here is that this is great, and worthy of your purchase. The problem with it is the third guy, Jack White. Who is he? Has anyone ever heard of that guy? He is a decent guitar player, although horrible singer. In the film they do these sections where they show one of the guys in his home, commenting on his work and influence. When that takes place with the Jack White guy you have to raise a cynical eyebrow, the ""Who is this guy?"" look. If they were able to get The Edge and Jimmy Page (both legends and geniuses, particularly Page) they could have gotten Jeff Beck, who is practically a brother to Jimmy Page. They could have gotten Eric Clapton too, maybe even Eddie Van Halen. Now THAT would have been the real deal, that: Three defining guitar men and the sounds they produced (Page, Van Halen, Edge). I guess the only downer there would have been that it would have made The Edge's genius seem less.

3977132,5,B002RVZV9U,"Renewed and deepened my appreciation for the talent of Jimmy Page, who was already one of my favorite musicians. Opened my eyes to the brilliance of The Edge, who I always considered only a perfectly adequate guitar player. I'd recently seen Jack White on stage with two different bands, and always enjoy his playing, and he's great here. Lots of music from all three, lots of insights into their development and a good amount of surprises. Jimmy Page playing Ramble On gives goosebumps. There are a few other living guitar players who have been as influential or important these three, but this isn't meant to be a comprehensive look at all the greats of the the last 50 years. It is a tribute, it is a jam session, it is one of the most memorable rock and roll documentaries I've ever seen.",1376524800,,792,4.584507042253521

I've always been a U2 fan (The Edge) and like the work that Jimmy Page (Led Zepplin) has done over the years, but I didn't know Jack White, until now. I like that they took three generations of unique guitarists to sow this picture together, giving it a broader audience, and I think anyone who likes guitar and Rock and Roll would really enjoy this picture.",1376438400,,549,4.288461538461538

Particularly wonderful are the segments with Jimmy Page, who steals the show as the white haired musical genius with a sparkle in his eye and young at heart smile.  He looks like Beethoven with a guitar in some scenes.  The scenes of him at Headley Grange are especially rewarding to watch.  The bonus features include some deleted scenes that...shouldn't have been deleted, but at least they are there.

3977170,5,B002RVZV9U,"I could watch this movie a hundred times.  So much to it.  I feel like I know all three of these musicians personlly now -- jimmy, the Edge, and Jack. I loved hearing about their creative processes, how each musician's personal life and history contributed to the shape of his career, and to see their passion for their art.  A really touching group of stories.  Never has a movie made it so clear that there is more than one way to skin a cat -- the three men had such diversely different personalities, philosophies and methods, yet all have been so successful.  And seeing them get together with only the wish to learn and share, no competition, no backstabbing -- just genuine mutual respect.  Just a terrific movie.",1368057600,,720,4.5859375
3977181,3,B002RVZV9U,"This was indeed an odd union of three musicians who might have felt they had little in common musically, only later discovering they had everything in common musically. The film truly does offer an amazing personal insight into the lives of three gifted and accomplished guitar players who share some of their secrets and insights, which alone is worth the price of admission. In my case I never much cared for the White Stripes or Jack White for that matter, who I feel though he is a truly gifted musician was misplaced in this documentary when you consider he was making company with two other greatly respected guitar masters while he simply hasn't earned such praise. Page and the Edge have earned these top spots, but I felt the third slot should have been reserved for someone as infamous as they, such as the likes of Jeff Beck, Clapton, or maybe Angus Young. White simply didn't seem to fit in my opinion even though strangely I felt compelled to think in some ways he did carry his weight even though he was clearly overshadowed by his far more infamous peers. Beyond this observation all three give some very interesting information about their humble beginings and their love for the guitar, each in their own way seemingly connected by fate to the roots of rock and the blues. It was a real treat watching the communication between all three gentlemen who are truly beyond the childish ideas of hamming it up and trying to do one better on each other. Rather these three men seem comfortably humbled by one another, learning from one another and being enriched by each other, free of any selfish ideas. Being a huge fan of the Edge led me here, but I went away far more interested in the other two men than I had previously been. But the whoile thing was rather forgettable.",1367884800,,1787,4.622641509433962

3977190,4,B002RVZV9U,"I've put off watching this movie forever, and so ... waiting so long to view it, I think I built up in my head that it would be more than it was, but ... I still liked it.

I honestly didn't know what to fully expect from 3 very different guitar players.  I found the bits with Jimmy Page the most enjoyable parts, as he is just such a happy and free person, who even at his age, still plays air guitar to his favorite recordings and curls his lip into a snarl of enjoyment when banging on his low hung Les Paul.  I've always been more of a Led Zeppelin fan as a whole vs considering Jimmy Page a guitar god idol, but, I have to say ... this film made me like Jimmy Page infinitely more, simply because of his attitude, and the fact that his spirit for music doesn't seem to have diminished with age.  Also, seeing the house where they recorded ""four"" and getting some inside info about how they recorded certain sounds was awesome (like the drums on ""When the Levee Breaks"").  They recorded in every room of that house, even out in the yard!
It was very interested to get the Edge's perspective, and also see where he came from, and why he is the way he is.  I think all the s*** that went on in Ireland during the time of his upbringing and the rise of U2 scarred him, and understandably so.  He seems like a quiet individual that is always thinking about more than he's saying.  It was neat to see how he uses a plethora of effects, almost as another instrument vs just ""effects.""  Most people, myself included, would get lost in hundreds of buttons and stop switches connect to 2-3 racks full of effects processors or pedals.  For the most part, I think the Edge keeps it all straight, but it was also neat to see that he does a lot of just random button pushing to see if the sound he's looking for will just happen by accident.
Lastly ... Jack White.  I appreciate someone who doesn't try so hard that their efforts towards perfection actually snub proliferation (in some sense).  While I love guys like Eric Johnson and Tom Scholz, their insane studio perfectionism definitely hurt their careers as a musician, and prevented not only more of their music getting out, but also just their bare musical souls getting out.  Then there's Jack White.  In my humble opinion, the man seems to be trying just as hard as the aforementioned, just in an inverse way.  When one tries so hard to fight against the man, technology, and progress, I think it is equally debilitating.  Jack White just kind of came off as having too much of an attitude for my tastes.  Besides, I often find that someone who states that they want a guitar that is hard to play, that it should be struggle, is often covering up for the fact that they just aren't that great of a guitar player, and frankly, don't want to put in the effort to become that.  There is nothing wrong with a well-made guitar that is set up properly, and a well-made amplifier that sounds great.  There will always be a struggle if you hope to achieve something better than what you are now.  So ... I just found Jack White to be a bit juxtaposed.  All I have to say is ... look at Jeff Beck.  He struggles with the guitar every night, and still has one of the most legendary attitudes in music history, yet his struggles are towards not being satisfied.  In that respect I liked Jack White's words towards the fact that if you're satisfied, you're done ... there's no where else to go.  James Hetfield has stated something similar.

All in all, great film, and a great watch if you're a guitar nut.",1365984000,,3547,4.354103343465046

And Jack White.....who?? Legendary? No way...he has some interesting chops but he just doesn't fit in. How was he even chosen for this project? I felt embarassed for him, sitting there in his goofy hats and paper covered guitar, spouting his guitar wisdom in front of Page....yikes!.....no.

Watching 3 generations of guitar interpretation was really interesting. The look on The Edge's face when Jimmy Page played the opening riffs to those classic Led Zep songs was priceless ! A combination of awe, respect, humility - in fact all 3 displayed the same reactions. It was also interesting to watch Jack White holding his own with Page and Edge - his back story was great -  making a guitar with a bottle and some wire, getting a mouth organ custom fitted to his guitar etc
A brilliant idea to put these guys together

3977301,5,B002RVZV9U,"This film is great. It Might Get Loud follows three well known guitarists who span three different generations of listeners. Jimmy Page introduced the world to blue-driven rock with Led Zeppelin, the Edge created sonic masterpieces in U2, and Jack White made the blues popular again in his two piece band The White Stripes. The film examines each guitarist and presents the guitar as much more than a musical instrument. Furthermore, It Might Get Loud aims to show what many guitarists believe- the guitar is not only 6 strings, it is an extension of the guitarist.

While some may be disappointed with the lack of ""jamming"" from our three guitarists, I was happy to come away from film with more than listening to a few guys play together. However, there are some very cool moments in the film. For example, Jimmy Page starts to play Whole Lotta Love and the Edge and Jack White become in a state of stupor and amazement. Also, there's a In My Time of Dying slide guitar jam that's quite beautiful because we get to see each guitarist add their personality to the song.

And intimate get-together with three of the most unique guitarists around discussing... well, the guitar. What it means to them, how they get their sound, how they recorded, why they do what they do with it.

The juxtaposition of these three mean is remarkable. Jack White recaptures the love of his old equipment and discusses why it was valid then and how it's valid now. The Edge with his wall of delays, distortions and modulators  looking for that elusive sound that will create the next U2 hit. And the old man himself, Jimmy Page showing you his guitars, his record collection, the old house where Zeppelin recorded.

There's a moment when all three are chatting and Jimmy stands up, picks up his Les Paul and begins slicing out the riff to Whole Lotta Love and you see Jack and the Edge just staring like two thunderstruck school boys as their idol gives them a private lesson.

There's a panel discussion after the documentary that opens up a lot to what you just saw and well worth the view.

3977330,5,B002RVZV9U,"I thought that this was a fantastic and well produced film and I enjoy watching it over and over. Some of the negative reviews that I read on this movie before I bought it were people expressing disappointment in the fact that you don't get to see that much of Jimmy, Edge, and Jack playing together. This is true so if you're hoping for some sort of a concert/performance video of these three then this movie is probably not for you. What it does give you is a very fun and interesting look at the characters behind the music and how they became who they are. I think what I enjoy the most is the insight into the emotions and the thought process that goes into how they play guitar and how they write music. There are plenty of great sound clips and performances too which really come to life with the included narrative. I also love the interaction between the three and the jam session at the end is worth the wait.

Watching and listening to them discuss this process was fascinating, and really opens up their music a bit.  I wish there was more footage of the three of them together, as that interaction was the highlight of the film for me, though watching Jimmy Page air jam to Link Wray's Rumble was certainly a magic moment.

3977345,4,B002RVZV9U,"I loved the Jimmy Page segments.  I liked Jack White's comments about his growing up where guitar wasn't cool, cramming two drumsets into his tiny bedroom, his upholstery shop music lessons, the immediately built primitive guitar made out of a 2X4, etc.  Edge seemed nervous or even somehow out of his league.  He comes off as a technocrat.  I own a lot of U2 albums but I don't listen to them much any more.  I like Edge as a human being - he has come up with some good songs and sounds...but in this movie, I get the sense that Page and White are the real artists.  Or that their muse is more immediately accessible to them without technology.  Page is God in the rock guitar world - let's face it.  Regardless of all the hype about Hendrix, when it comes to music I care to actually * listen * to, Page is head and shoulders about Hendrix.  Before you blast me - opinions vary - it's just my opinion.  As far as the Jack White haters go - the only thing I found phoney about Jack White was having that younger version pseudo-doppleganger of him that he would talk to - that seemed a bit puzzling / contrived.  The guru here who passes on wisdom freely and effortlessly - without ego - is Page.  I notice that when Page shows Kashmir (in the extras), that White seems to pick it up and try it and ""gets"" it quicker than Edge.  All that being said, I would gladly see any of these 3 guitarists in concert.",1347148800,2,1406,4.2406015037593985

3977361,2,B002RVZV9U,"A wasted opportunity might be a suitable answer to the above question.  I may be wrong, but I watched this (on HBO, thankfully) thinking that it was about guitarists playing guitars.  Being one myself, the prospect seemed riveting, even if I'm not a fan of the Edge or knew much about Jack White.  I foolishly thought they would be sharing tricks of the trade, swapping  riffs, jamming, talking about effects, and all things guitar.

There is some of this... but only a smattering and nothing developed.  We do get however, the early histories of each musico (!), as if endless documentaries on the matter don't already abound.  We see the Edge going back to his old school (twice!), commenting on the IRA (how relevant is that?!), White recounts childhood stories in a Mexican neighborhood (yawn), and some more than familiar Page memories.  Then, there is much footage on each musician on his own  working at home, the studio(although hardly any on Page), and even in concert (old Zep reels).

And the guys sitting around jamming???  Precious little.

You see, I thought they would be together in a room playing away, LIKE THE TRAILER SHOWED.  This is but a fraction of the movie.  Do not get your hopes up.  The only ONE real jam is on Page's ""In My Time Of Dying"", and then the movie briefly worked for me.  (They do get together at the very end to sing The Band's ""The Weight"", but it's pretty forgettable.)

My last quibble.  Jack White was virtually unknown to me & may remain so:  he is unimpressive as a guitarist and especially as a songwriter.  He seems more intent on trying to shed some cred on himself most of the time.  The Edge fared better though what he reveals barely scratched the surface on technique, style, habits, etc.  Page has the riffs so his contributions were interesting yet negligible, and again hardly anything on his playing.

I watched this for the interaction among the three and the playing insights.  I got neither.  This is shallow material somewhat deceitfully advertized.",1338076800,5,2011,4.742774566473988

3977365,5,B002RVZV9U,"Review number 194. I must say that this DVD turned out to be much better than I had anticipated. Truly deserves a five-star rating. 'It Might Get Loud' brings together three of the most inventive, trend-setting and innovative guitarists - namely Jimmy Page, U2's The Edge and The White Stripe's mastermind Jack White. This DVD is priceless - the way these three six-string pioneers compare notes, tell stories, try to learn from each other, etc. This DVD had some super-rare U2 footage from 1979-80 that I have never seen before. Was sort of taken with where they show Jack White 'constructing' his own homemade guitar and then where he drives to a remote cabin and piddle around a bit on the piano - playing some vintage (I'm guessing) blues number. Plus, I loved the scene where you're invited into Jimmy Page's den - where he is a obviously a major vinyl collector. He plays a 45 single or two by his musical influences like Link Wray and Robert Johnson. Worth - many, (many) repeated plays.",1336176000,2,994,4.685714285714286
3977366,4,B002RVZV9U,"Having been a huge fan of The Edge, I was really mostly interested in only his part of the film. But I have to say, I never really got into much of Jack White's music. But after watching this, I truly appreciate his musical talent and his raw ingenuity. I also now have a whole new appreciation for Led Zeppelin. I mean, Jimmy Page blew my mind! I have Led Zeppelin's box set, but now knowing how Jimmy and the rest of the band created their music was really inspiring.

The film is pretty fitting considering the 3 differences in generation gap between the guitarists and history. It's like the film has something for anyone who's into rock and roll.

I would like to see a sequel with some other guitarist like, BB King, Clapton, and Slash. (There are some many greats!)",1335657600,2,772,4.429577464788732

3977398,4,B002RVZV9U,This is exactly what this movie is a documentary. I know fans of Jimmy Page who never got to see him in concert were slightly disappointed because the scenes in the movie did not show how he played the guitar all the way through. Watching to see how he plays each song. That's is exactly why The Song Remains the Same is a movie. This documentary takes you through how each musician got to where they were and how the guitar is part of their life. In detail of showing each guitarist characters. I enjoyed seeing 3 different generations show their unique style through one instrument from different cultures. I would recommend this movie to those who worship great guitar playing.

3977412,4,B002RVZV9U,"No question anyone who likes their rock music via guitar must see this film.
My only bit I wasn't happy with was the pick of Jack White, he lacks really
any deep creative flow with the guitar. He gets a kick playing the most beat
up guitars he can find and even better so a guitar out of tune seems to make
his mind a well of musical constipation. ""Please"" this doesn't make sense and the
2 pros take it in stride however you can see they look a little confused as to his
aproach on such an instrument.........To each their own but another pick would have
put a little more flame to the film. I should make it clear Rory Gallagher however
can pick any old junk guitar and make it sing to the heavens but you won't find him
when alive or in the heavens playing it out of tune.

I'm sure a few will rant but I don't care as I play guitar and understand at least
in how it should be aproached in terms of playing it, not with a bunch of food on the
strings.............",1323561600,,966,4.08421052631579

3977415,5,B002RVZV9U,"Well, Jimmy Pate makes this film come alive. Something about the touch of stringed instruments is sensual, commanding-even a weapon of war or protest. It can make you dream, fall in love, remember lost love, observe the love that past you by-it all comes from the heart.
And elder statesman of the guitar, Jimmy Page selects 2 guys who have completely different styles. Are they good? Yes, in their own way-they are killers and very passionate. What I liked was the humor and self-deprecating manner. The wit, the smiles, the 'oh yes...I get it-how lovely"", feelings and the mutual admiration. Watch Page, as he studies the ""Young Turks"", with the smile and penetrating eyes.

Jiimmy Page is generous with his secrets, as time permits. White and The Edge, warm to Jimmy's candid take on music and how he shrugs off tunes like, ""Stairway To Heaven"", as he does a nice demo on his double-neck Gibson SG with a 12 string and 6 string neck.

This has to be one of the best guitar (and even if you don't play) and most enjoyable DVDs on music. Nice to see, the musical roots that Jack White explains, in his musical development.
Imagine installing a custom harmonica microphone for his vocals that pulls right out of the body of a modified guitar he designed. And the distortion with melodic overtones, on Jack's voice, is
something to behold. All three men, are highly intelligent (Page really shines here) and creative composers.

This is superior to any concert film you may see, because it is personal and intimate. Watch the expressions of the other two, while one makes his
narrative. Yes, turn it up loud, own it, but here is the big point-watch it multiple times. The brain cannot simply absorb all that is going on here.  Einstein said 11 times to understand even the basic ideas. I would say 30 times, to really get into what this music documentary is trying to say.

3977417,5,B002RVZV9U,"I had not heard Jack White, except briefly in Glastonbury Festival DVD as White Stripes with his sister Meg on drums. I knew Page of course & everyone knows Bono. I believe the previews were exactly what was delivered, and then some. I loved the behind-the-scenes footage, especially showing White building a guitar on a piece of wood using ONE wire and a coke bottle to play it, while a cow lazily chews its cud next to him in a rural field in England! I could immediately tell that not only had White done his homework by studying from the masters of blues, he had talent the likes of which we rarely see (eg. Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Hendrix). The video does seem to focus more on White & Page second, very little of Bono before the jam session.

What's interesting is that as Page was playing guitar, he made the exact same facial expressions he did over 30 years ago in Song Remains the Same live performance, I watched both the same week, and noticed he hasn't changed how much he LOVES playing guitar, or his passion about music. The 3 men meet on a built-up stage similar to a wresting ring without the rope, up off the main floor. Each has his little setup, equipment, effects hardware & guitars, amps, etc. At 1st they all stay in their own little areas, but as they start to play, one by one, they each get excited about what the other can do, wanting to learn from each other, as in ""I always wondered how you did that"". Bono is the most humble it seems, as he keeps telling us if it weren't for his effects pedals, he'd be playing a repeated boring bass guitar sound--anything BUT boring, either way. We get to see how Bono makes the sounds & the fact that he plays differently EVERY time. Of course, both younger axe men get the most excited when Page plays, truly in awe and wanting to learn some tricks of the trade--in fact all 3 share numerous tips & secrets, with each other, & us vicariously.

For those who love jam sessions, when anything can & does happen musically, when 3 of the greatest guitarists get together, it's music heaven. The viewer feels as if present with them, just as excited as they are to play, and as we are to hear the original music these three make TOGETHER, jamming & truly loving what they are doing, which shows through all they do on this film.

There was NO script, that's why the lead up was suspenseful, because no one knew what to expect, throwing 3 greats in a room on a stage together with NO direction, no goal, just It MIGHT Get Loud, and it doesn't take long for them to develop a rapport. The initial nervousness may have been a result of the self-doubt many (even famous!) artists feel about their work, and wondering how they will be judged by musicians they believe are BETTER than they are, which may or may not be true, it's a mindset of humility in the presence of someone they admire & respect, perhaps even emulate. This is true of Page, for the up & comers, as it is for the newer musicians. No egos get in the way of a fantastic, one of a kind, never to be repeated, jam session experience. :-) One will never regret buying this DVD/movie, for it will be watched with the same pleasure repeatedly over the years. Plus, how long has it been since we've heard ANY thing LIVE from Led Zeppelin? Too long! Here's your chance to see & hear Page in his element, the same goes for all of them, as they soon forget the cameras, the audience, everything but the music. However, this is one experience WE will never forget.",1312243200,,3483,4.371913580246914
3977418,5,B002RVZV9U,I have seen this movie 3 times and I enjoy it each and every time. I always find something new that amazes and intrigues me.

3977419,5,B002RVZV9U,"""It Might Get Loud"" is awesome.  I wish they'd turn this into a series, with a bunch of different artists.  The concept of pulling guitarists from several different bands into a room together to discuss their equipment, techniques, styles, strings... it's just an awesome little voyeuristic adventure that fans eat up, and fellow musicians understand.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  As a musician, it's totally understood.  I played in a rehearsal studio for several years where a dozen or more bands were in and out all the time.  When we finished our practice, I would wander down the hall and listen to what other bands were playing.  If I liked it, I'd knock on the door, and if allowed in, I'd hang out and talk 'shop' with the other musicians.  Everyone always comes out enriched from such experiences.  It is a stroke of genius that someone orchestrated this and filmed it.  Carry on, carry on!  We need more of this!  Make a sequel!  Make several!",1311638400,3,964,4.734939759036145
3977420,5,B002RVZV9U,"This is not just a film about the electric guitar. It is a film about three different rock icons from three different generations, three different places and three totally different musical eras and how their love of this instrument shaped their careers in music.

Cut to Jack White, the youngest and the cockiest of the three, out on the fields of Tennessee, building a Didley Bow--a rough and ready one-string plucking instrument--with cows looking on. If, like me, you walked into the movie with any doubt at all about his place next to the likes of Jimmy Page, that uncertainty was quickly put to rest from the get-go. Not only does he play his instruments well, he makes `em, he reinvents `em, he owns `em. Hell, he'd chew `em up if he could.

Here are three guitar heros who were able to do something different than what had been done before. White really just plays the blues, but he does it his way. And as we peek in at him as he teaches his younger self--as if he could go back in time--we learn about his well-defined sense of aesthetic and purpose: Technology destroys creativity & truth.

How would these three icons get along? They had met only incidentally before. So, what we see on screen is fresh, unscripted and unrehearsed.

Cut to Edge: Like White, he has clear ideas about the sounds he wants to create. But unlike White, it is all pedals and effects. We are, then, presented with the juxtaposition of the anti-tech and the total-tech. And unlike White, he's never satisfied. He'll practice one lick all day, if that's what it takes to get it right.

The photography is beautiful, the lighting is dramatic. It's not just a dry documentary with interviews in linear form. It's the interweaving of three different stories that turn out to be not so different after all.

In each case, there is a turning point that inevitably leads to their becoming who they are. For White, should he even be playing the Blues, as a white kid from Detroit? For Page, how could he break free of the stifling world of session work? And for The Edge, would they be able to set themselves apart from the prevalent music of the day?

The live footage of a U2 show, almost religious in its all around magnitude and power, reminds us of their place in rock's history. The narrative flirts from the spectacular to the personal, where we see three intimate portraits of three creative musicians each of whom had a love affair with the guitar.

Cut to Page: He turns the volume knob on his amp, and the soft, but familiar sounds of summer emerge. Memories of road trips, romances and heartbreak are evoked, as if by magic, from the wooden instrument caressed by Page's hands. It is, as any true Zeppelin fan would have recognized from the first chord, Ramble On. And it is one of the standout moments of the film. With a seamless hit of the tone switch, the riff explodes. Goosebumps are carpeted on the Zep fan's arms. Light and shade, Page explains, by way of layered audio track. Dressed in black, with his white hair loose, his shoulders sway as he plays along the entire length of the fret board. ""It is like a whisper to the thunder,"" Page says.

They exchange stories, secrets and licks and by the end of it all, a friendship and a mutual respect emerges. White demonstrates ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground."" It's fun to see how serious Edge is about figuring it out and getting it right. In his turn, Edge shows the others ""I Will Follow;"" when Page asks for clarification--""is this in ""C?""--the delight of snooping takes on amplified proportions - a simple question made interesting because it comes from the likes of Page. He's got nothing to prove--he just wants to jam and get it right.

And when Page launches into the opening riff of Whole Lotta Love, you know you're seeing one of those moments that are rarely seen--one of those moments where you find yourself wondering what the camera guys' faces looked like.

In Ireland, U2 fans will soak up every moment of Edge's visit to his old school and will see the signboards where U2 became U2. We're there when he unearths the earliest, rawest recordings of themselves that exist. We hear what would become ""Where the Streets Have No Name,"" which is so raw, in fact, that Bono is simply counting the time because there are no lyrics.

At Headley Grange--where Zep recorded their third and fourth albums--Zeppelin fans will relish another remarkable scene in which Page plays ""The Battle of Evermore"" on mandolin, so exquisitely, while we look on from beyond the green, majestic grounds.

We hear about their first guitars and who their influences were. The usually private Page takes us into his home and into his record collection room, where he plays air guitar to ""The Rumble"" with the exuberance of a child.

Then, as if to throw us a sweet little goodie for the road, they send us off with an impromptu, acoustic take on ""The Weight"" by The Band, with Edge and White trading vocals. And you wish it wouldn't end.",1309651200,2,4976,4.614253393665158

3977424,5,B002RVZV9U,"My daughter found this DVD for me. I did not know the film existed.
Led Zeppelin, U2, and White Stripes together? Not quite, but nearly. Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White meet for some `talk' and a session. The result is enriched by clips of music by the 3 bands, plus some of their influences. Something like a United Nations of rock music. The 3 guitarists are from different countries (England, Ireland, and the US), and since they are also of 3 different `generations', they have slightly different stories to tell.
Page, of my generation, and one of the stars of my favorites Led Zeppelin (up on top together with the Stones), has most to tell in terms of rock history. I would have loved to see more Yardbirds here.
In comparison, The Edge has a shorter history, but a much more political one, with U2's exposure to the times of Irish terrorism and clashes with the British forces of order. The Edge is also the most technical one of the three.
White, the youngest, draws heavily on his blues roots, playing old records, and showing the simplicity of a basic approach (e.g. building a `guitar' with a coke bottle).

The result? Ear candy for rock fans. Is it a good movie? No way. Too fragmented, too many snippets. It is like appetizers for main course, many of them. Can I give it less than 5 stars? No way. It is too much fun to let any dissatisfaction crawl in. Yes, it might have been done better. Imagine a 5 hours concert or clips of the 3 bands...
For me, Led Zeppelin is tops, and I like White Stripes very much, while U2 reaches me only sometimes. You see that there is no full balance here. And anyway, I don't do music reviews.",1303516800,4,1648,4.421052631578948

Highlight moment (one mentioned in an earlier review) Jimmy Page playing the chords to a classic Led Zep song and the look on the faces of The Edge and Jack White,is priceless.",1303084800,,399,4.797101449275362
3977426,4,B002RVZV9U,"If you're a rock guitarist, you're going to get a lot out of this movie. This is a low-key summit of sorts in which three very different guitarists (Jimmy Page, the Edge, and Jack White)kick back to trade licks and talk about why the love playing electric guitar so much. In separate segments, we also learn about many of the obstacles each man has faced in becoming a truly unique and memorable instrumentalist. For Page - the most musicianly of the lot - it seems to have been the fear of being a session player for the rest of his life. White, on the other hand, feared that his passion for the blues would lock him into a predictable 12 bar ""blues-rock"" box. The Edge's story is most dramatic, taking us back to the Ireland of the 1970s which was wracked by an awful economy and hideous acts of terrorism. It's an absolute treasure seeing each of their unique approaches and contrasting them; the Edge revels in high-tech pedals and rack effects whereas White prefers cheaper guitars and amps that he has to ""fight"" to get a sound out of.

If you're not a rock guitarist, you will probably deduct a star from my interview and wish there were more ""fight"" in this movie. There's absolutely no conflict on display here, and all three guitar heroes are true gentlemen even when they politely disagree. The very best rock movies (such as ""Hail, Hail Rock and Roll"" and even the comedy ""This is Spinal Tap"") are able to attract nonmusicians through very dramatic scenes with conflict. I saw this film with a nonmusician who found the film long-winded and tedious when the guitarists weren't playing, and I can understand why.

Still, to me, the true beauty of the film is how it forces the viewer to re-evaluate guitarists who they may not personally enjoy. There are those who have claimed Page is a dinosaur who couldn't play well on stage, that the Edge is a player of effects rather than of music, and that White is a barely competent eccentric. I believe this movie proves those people wrong, and it reveals the professional craft behind even what sounds like off-the-cuff playing. ""It Might Get Loud"" is like an impromptu jam session with wonderful, supportive friends who allow you to be yourself, and it's worth viewing if you are a musician yourself.",1302739200,,2258,4.6425

3977430,4,B002RVZV9U,"""It Might Get Loud"" is an excellent documentary for those who want to look into the different creative processes behind some popular rock guitarists, both young and old.  Some have critizied Jack White's role in this film but it's obvious.  He presents himself as a low-tech, go-by-feel, minimal guitar effect guy.  He is anti-The Edge in this regard, as we see The Edge explain his dependence on rack upon rack of effects to obtain his sound.  Jimmy Page is the elder scholar throughout.  The glimpse of his guitar collection, guitar cases lined up in a storage area, is impressive.  I didn't expect him to be as articulate as he is in this piece.

IMGL is a very well directed and produced film.  Shots are interestingly framed and audio is excellent throughout.

Three different generations of men, that love and rock the guitar well. I think the film spent about the same amount of time on the three of them, maybe Page was shorted a few minutes. I did enjoy the moments they just sat around and played their own songs, as the other two watched with smiles and appreciation. When Page cranked-up Whole Lotta Love you could see the Edge smile like a little kid. The opening minutes was Jack White making a guitar out of spare parts including a soda bottle, MacGuyver-style.

I agree somewhat with other reviewer's notes for this product, as Jack White's portayed attitude/facial expression is abrasive by comparison and he doesn't seem to add much value to the discussion at first. However, if you watch this with an open mind and if you like his stuff already, it is decent and you can dig where he's coming from. He just comes off as a punk kid amongst rock history legends; maybe it is intended. Different music styles and generation differences might skew how one views this DVD. All said, it was worth the money, and I recommend that any fan of these guys, or rock history in general, at least watch this production once. It opened my interests enough to check out more of White's music and you can't go wrong be delving into more Led Zep! U2 will remain favorite, for me.

The thing that I enjoyed the most from this DVD was how it suddenly made their work more grounded and real.  There is logic, but also choas.

3977450,5,B002RVZV9U,"""It Might Get Loud'' is a joyous celebration of rock n roll. It tells us what's behind the guitar solos that rock stadiums and music clubs -- the years, sometimes decades, of experimentation, collaboration and self-doubt. Of practicing over and over to find the sound that conveys precisely the emotions roiling inside a song. The documentary brings together three extraordinary guitarists -- Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White -- and lets them talk about their music for a good hour and a half.

I was entranced.

They are three very different men and very different artists. Page, of course, is rock royalty, and he's a regal presence here with his white mane and striking features. He's a low-key, gifted storyteller, who seems to light up when he plays his guitar. (Page is also one of the film's associate producers, which might explain why he comes off so well.) The Edge uses technology to perfect his sound -- the sound that makes U2 so unique. Even now, he confesses to moments of terrifying self-doubt. It's somehow reassuring to learn that the ultimate big-stadium rock band started out practicing, and floundering, in a little Irish classroom after school.

White is a tough man to like. He's edgy and tormented, pale and doughy -- Edward Scissorhands on a Snickers bar binge. But I came away admiring him anyway. He's on a single-minded quest to create music pure and true. He admits at one point that everything he does amounts to an attempt to produce something as honest and clean as bluesman Son House's gritty a cappella song ""Grinnin' in Your Face.'' Sometimes he seems to be trying to rip the music right out of himself. The film's most unsettling moment is a shot of White blood-streaked guitar at the end of a performance.

If you want to hear about groupies and drugs, this isn't the film for you. You won't learn about Page's demons or even get any clarity about the murky relationship between Jack and Meg White. This is all about music. And thank God for that. In a way, it's a rock tutorial. I came away eager to listen to The Jam, one of the punk era bands that inspired U2. And I was amazed I'd never heard of Link Wray, whose ""Rumble'' is one bad-ass piece of rock n roll (as Page, the Edge and White agree) and who seems to have been about two decades ahead of his time, judging from the evidence here.",1295308800,,2334,4.603365384615385
3977461,4,B002RVZV9U,"Like most people who bought this DVD as soon as it came out (ordered in advance, actually), I am a HUGE Zeppelin fan, and an admirer of Edge.  I knew very little about Jack White, so I was curious to say the least.  After watching the film twice back to back, I came away impressed.  First, the audio quality is outstanding.  If you have a high-end audio system like me, crank this baby up and enjoy.  I won't make this review a novel, but I will say that all three performers were outstanding.  I got goosebumps when Jimmy walked in the door at Headley Grange, and reflected on recording Led Zeppelin IV there, even pointing out where they placed Bonzo's drums under the staircase because of the unique sound the echo produced.  Being only a 'casual' fan of Edge, I can say I was really impressed with his talent; his reflection of his old school, and explaining how he started his first band there, is similiar to Page's scene at Headley Grange.  Jack White, who I knew nothing about, truly admires the other two, and he stands alone with his talent as well.  The opening scene with White making a guitar out of a Coke bottle is one of the best scenes in the entire film.  This is well worth checking out, so buy it and see for yourself.",1294876800,2,1239,4.37117903930131
3977462,3,B002RVZV9U,"The idea behind this film is great: Assemble guitar heroes, play guitars and talk shop. A great idea. With that as a start, why, why why, why go anywhere near Jack White? There are SO many legitimate guitar gods we'd love to hear from (all of us can name at least 10 off the top of our heads), but they choose White. What a waste of great opportunity. Jack White has not yet earned his stripes as a musician or a songwriter, let alone reached guitar god status. Most of us guitar players know him for what he truly is: a very basic guitar player with very little creativity and no originality. His career is already waning, supporting the sentiment that he is completely undeserving to be in this film with Page and Edge. Worst of all, White carries himself in the movie as the most important person in the room - speaking constantly and almost not letting Jimmy Page and The Edge get a word in edgewise.
Despite the unbearable and painful presence of White the film is a must see for guitar players who love to get insight into the lives and thoughts of legitimate guitarists Page and Edge - who both have made lasting impact on the way guitarists play and listeners listen to modern music.",1294876800,3,1191,4.442922374429224

3977491,2,B002RVZV9U,"This move was disappointing to me.  For starters, I found the combination of those three personalities to be odd, but not in a good way.  In Jimmy Page, you have a genuine rock legend and a gentle soul.  In The Edge, you have a quiet, intellectual, journeyman musician who has nothing to prove to anyone, but is visibly in awe of what Jimmy has accomplished.  Finally, we have Jack White, the pure embodiment of pretentiousness.  It was a real eye-rolling moment when Jack made a strong anti-technology statement about music, just moments before they showed Edge's huge rack full of guitar gear.  It was immediately apparent that Jack and The Edge had very little common ground musically, and were merely trying to remain civil with each other in order to make it though the day.  The whole thing felt contrived and would have been a total failure, if not for Jimmy's good humor.

I think the producers should have focused more on the segments of each player individually and completely eliminated any scenes with all three together.  Better yet, they should have simply made a two-hour movie about Jimmy Page.  THAT would be a must-see.",1287532800,10,1137,4.7846153846153845

Page, Edge and White are all intelligent musicians, each with their own style and techniques, but each just oozing love of music.  The viewer just finds himself with a stupid grin on his face loving almost every minute of the movie.  There are moments of reflection, of discovery, of plain enthusiasm and joy.  The reviewer has spent plenty of time jumping up and down on the edge of his bed as a youth, jamming to Zeppelin tunes with a tennis racket for an air guitar; unbelieveable to watch Jimmy Page playing air guitar listening to his own heroes!

3977496,4,B002RVZV9U,"I fell in love with this movie in the first minute.

I fell in love with this movie simply from the title...it MIGHT get loud.

I fell in love with this movie because in my mind music is what's there when there are no words.

What I love about this movie is its simplicity.  It's a love affair with music...specifically the electric guitar...and three of its hereos: Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin, The Edge from U2 and Jack White from The White Stripes & The Raconteurs.  These three musical artists are unbelievable!  I was already enamoured with Jimmy Page and The Edge, but the surprise of this film for me was how much I fell in love with Jack White and his story.  I've heard White's music but it never seemed to connect very strongly with me until today while watching this movie.  I think it was the stripping of him down to his musical core that got me.  Like so many things, I fall in love with the story of a person.  I fall in love with the dramatization of that story as well.  I'm simply a sucker for a great story...that's where my art starts.

Because this movie is very experiential like a concert, you can't capture it in static words like in this review.  So just watch the movie and turn the volume up!  I will say that the title sequence on this movie is one of my favorites ever.  It is just so clean and powerful seeing close-up details of these incredible guitars with ""rock-n-roll"" fonts ""etched"" in the visuals.  Very cool stuff!",1286323200,,1453,4.385767790262173
3977497,3,B002RVZV9U,"For someone who has long loved guitars and classic rock, few documentary premises have intrigued me more than It Might Get Loud's - filming three generations of famous guitarists spontaneously chatting/jamming and interspersing their personal stories. Unfortunately, execution does not live up to promise. For starters, many may quibble with the guitarists - Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White -, but they essentially exemplify their generations and have a nice rapport. I would have of course loved to see other favorites included, and it would have been nice to see a pre-Page player, but the choices are hard to fault. The fact that they have very different styles is certainly a plus. I am a major, long-time Page fan and a minor Edge fan, so I was mostly excited on their part. They of course need no introduction; the mere fact that they are here makes it worth watching for fans. I had very little previous exposure to White, and what I knew - the most popular White Stripes singles - left me rather unimpressed. However, this gave me newfound respect for him. I still dislike his vocals and lyrics, but he truly deserves to be in the film not only because he is a noticeably talented guitarist but also because he has great knowledge of and respect for tradition. In addition, he is very humble and clearly grateful to be around the veterans, even if his reserve seems a bit studied and his traditionalism somewhat self-conscious. As for those who still doubt, it is after all very hard to think of another qualifying popular player from the 2000s.

How much one likes the movie depends on expectations. I hoped the majority of it would be the guitarists talking and jamming, but this is far from true. Opening sequences create suspense about their meeting, with each wondering what will happen, but the meeting is a pathetic anticlimax; there is no excitement and hardly even a meeting scene at all. The interactions are undoubtedly absorbing, especially the players' interest in each other's work and the younger guitarists clearly being in awe of Page. However, the interaction is disappointingly low-key; there is almost no fire or magic. Many have mentioned the pivotal scene where The Edge and White watch Page play ""Whole Lotta Love"" like awe-stricken schoolboys, and the film is indeed almost worth watching for it alone, but it is the only such moment. The paucity of their playing together is particularly annoying; not even one full song is shown, and many are cut off far too early. These could have at least been given as extras, but that is sadly not the case. Segments of the individual players describing their techniques are more revealing, especially The Edge's.

Viewers wanting other performance footage will also be disappointed, though this does not pretend to be a concert film. The archival footage will be familiar to fans but is generally used well, while footage of the individual musicians is among the highlights. Page fans will be especially thrilled to hear - and in one case see - the master play two new songs.

The real problem is that, since only hard-cores will watch this, the documentary footage taking up such a large part of the film has little or nothing that viewers will not already know. I say this as a Page fan; the case may be otherwise for Edge/White fans, but I doubt it. Director Davis Guggenheim points out in an interview that it is interesting to see the guitarists tell their own story, but the lack of real insights is still highly detrimental. Even so, there are a few charming scenes, notably Page smiling like a star struck teenager and playing air guitar to Link Wray's ""Rumble.""

Some miscellaneous points remain. The sound is strong throughout, which is of course key, and the cinematography is generally good, but many editing decisions are highly questionable. For example, a short perusal of deleted scenes - especially Page demonstrating ""Kashmir"" - shows that they are often better than much of what is used. Written or spoken narration would also have been very useful. Lack of a plot is inherent to the film and basically an asset - at least in theory -, but the way the movie jumps from one guitarist to the other without transitions or any real plan is sometimes confusing. Certain things that are unclear to non-hard-cores - e.g., the significance of the White Stripes playing in an old-fashioned hall to an audience of stuck-up, older men and The Edge's reference to a letter that led to U2's formation - would also have been cleared up. As for the animation, some may question it, but I found it mostly effective and notably funny. In contrast, the ""young Jack"" gag quickly grows old and has no redeeming worth.

All told, fans of the guitarists must of course watch this, as perhaps should the guitar-obsessed generally, but it is not strong enough to attract others.",1284854400,30,4851,4.818727490996398

3977521,5,B002RVZV9U,"What I really liked best about this documentary was that its maker really probed these three musicians endlessly about their creativity.  He was dogged about finding their inspirations and their stories from the earliest days.  He unearthed little known facts, which might strike one as trivia at first, but then you realize that without those idiosyncratic tics, they might not be the people they are today.

For example, Page went to art school in addition to everything else he's done.  He just couldn't live if he didn't try painting, drawing, graphic design, etc., in addition to everything else he was doing in music. White grew up in a lower class section of Detroit, where he was one of the few whites, in a family of ten kids.  Very few people wanted to play musical instruments in that area.  They all wanted to perform rap.  Yet he had so much musical equipment in his very small bedroom that he had to sleep on a foam rubber mat at an angle on the floor.  The Edge is the only politically motivated one but he is in such a band, U2, with the kids he met in grade school.  He takes us back to his school.

The above is just a very small sampling of what the director manages to unearth about these three musicians.  I found it utterly fascinating. One other thing the director did is drop entirely the personal lives of these three as far as wives, ex-wives, girlfriends, children, etc.,  For all we know by the end, all three are single and childless. (I know this isn't true but from other sources.)  This omission was great as there was never the temptation to veer into tabloid fodder with this material.

3977524,2,B002RVZV9U,"This project sounded like a documentary director's wet dream project: Take three of rock music's most famous guitarists who have never met, put them on a sound stage with old chairs, a set of guitars, amps, effects, and LP records, hire about thirty camera people to document the ""event,"" and see what happens.

Well, unfortunately, what happened was not the mind-blowing experience I was expecting. You would think that there would be more magic in the room than there was, but you cannot force magic to happen in a contrived environment. You can hope that ""something"" will happen, but oftentimes it's just an average experience, and that's how this DVD left me feeling. Like I had witnessed something average.

That's not to say that this DVD is worthless. It has wonderful moments of Jack White making a diddly-bow, The Edge going to his old school and showing how he works effects into his songs, and then Jimmy Page smiling like a school boy as he plays an old record from his youth.

But I so wanted their meeting to explode with magic and passion, and it just did not live up to the hype for me. While it was nice to see The Edge and Jack White seemingly in awe of Jimmy Page as the latter began the first notes of ""Whole Lotta Love,"" one song is not enough to make their meeting worthwhile.

See it for the individual documentary pieces on the three, but don't expect any real energy or magic from their meeting because it never materializes. At least, it didn't materialize for me.",1282521600,4,1490,4.590225563909774
3977525,4,B002RVZV9U,"It Might Get Loud is an interesting mish mash of three different generations of guitarists and what inspired them.  Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), The Edge (U2), and Jack White (The White Stripes, The Raconteurs) take you on a trip down memory lane and explain their approach to guitar playing, along with some interesting stories of what influenced them as kids.  It's a good documentary as a whole, but there are times when it seems a bit self-indulgent.

I guess the main point of the documentary is how guitar playing has evolved over the decades and how it's still relevant today.  It would seem that Jimmy represented the 60's and 70's, while The Edge represented the 80's and 90's.  I assume Jack White represented the 00's and whatever is to come.  What is very clear is the passion these three men have for the art form.  Through archival footage and interviews we get to see these guys in ways most probably haven't seen before.  I was intrigued by some of the old TV footage of Jimmy Page when he was in his early teens.  It was really interesting watching these three guys jam together and sort of get off on each others riffs.  I particularly enjoyed the trio's rendition of ""The Weight.""

There are times, however, when the film feels a bit disjointed.  The structure of the film is rather arbitrary, jumping from one guitarist's story to another's and then back again.  Most of the film is these guys just talking about what they like.  They do play occasionally, but I found that those segments were cut too short.  Some of the archival footage is of them playing live, and just when they get really rockin' they cut to more interviews.  What a bunch of teases.

Self-indulgence aside, if you like documentaries about music you will likely find something to enjoy in It Might Get Loud.  The blu-ray version of the film looks and sounds excellent.",1281916800,,1858,4.664615384615384

That started for me about halfway into this project.  I knew about Page and Edge of course, had heard of Jack but knew little about him.  I now know he's a very odd, self-important duck, almost a parody of ... well of someone trying to play Jack White.  Page is somewhat reflective and plays some licks, Edge is either really self-effacing or has almost no personality - and it was frustrating to just keep hearing how much he loved effects, and how many effects he had, and how he could combine them, OK I get it.  But can you play?  That is never really answered in the film.

When the 3 of them come together on the soundstage, once again there's plenty of kindling but it never catches fire.  Just an old bloke, a middle aged bloke and a young 'un who has decided he's not going to be awed by the others and just act like he's their equal.

The conversations and insights shared between the three greats is really special. It did at first seem like an unusual choice and there's obviously a lot of other guitarists to choose from who are technically stronger and play more like virtuosos but I think that's the point of the film: it's about what you do with it and music isn't about how fast or difficult it is to play, it's about whether or not it works and is original. All of these guys score highly in the originality area and all three have a huge following though arguably Jimmy Page is the big legend and the others definitely have a few ""we're not worthy!"" looks back and forth. The documentary footage is good and it was surprising to see where U2 started out and the actual school classroom. The age group aspect works well too. You have the old guy, the middle aged one and the younger one which illustrates the tradition of music. It's a thing that's passed on and each new generation adds to it. Good film, pass it on!",1279670400,,1124,4.434782608695652
3977533,3,B002RVZV9U,"The director clearly has an infatuation for Jack White, since he gets more screen time than Jimmy Page or Edge, almost more than them combined.  This is unfortunate, since I think he's the least talented, least interesting, and most pretentious of the trio.  In a way, I felt a bit cheated, since very little of the film reflects the promotional aspect - the three of them sitting together and discussing their varied approaches to making music.  That material can be found (and not nearly enough of it for my liking) in some of the DVD extras, which I found more interesting than the cut film itself.  It's worth a watch, but unless you're a Jack White fan, prepare to be a bit disappointed.",1279584000,3,692,4.6016260162601625

3977536,4,B002RVZV9U,"What happens if The Edge, lead guitarist of U2; Jack White, guitarist and singer of The White Stripes and of The Raconteurs; and Jimmy Page, forming member and lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin get together and tune their guitars for a jam session? It might get loud. This casual meeting between three strong character guitarists was arranged by director Davis Guggenheim, who accompanied their chitchat with a camera. The outcome of the shoptalk can be seen in the rockumentary ""It Might Get Loud"".
 This production was not Davis Guggenheim's first attempt in this genre. He is experienced and award-winning in shooting documentaries, having produced the 2007 Oscar-winning documentary ""An Inconvenience Truth"". In his latest masterpiece ""It Might Get Loud"" Guggenheim provides insight into the life of guitar heroes of three generations. By the choice of Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White the producer manages to bridge guitar history, present and future. All three participants give away internal details on their own progress as guitarists, their bands' successes and they show each other some tricks that give their play a personal touch.
Without having any expectations, the protagonists bring their guitars and meet in Warner Brothers' Burbank Studios in California. Here, making themselves comfortable on a plain stage in an abandoned hall, they exchange experiences, wallow in memories, listen to their favourite music and together they play their most famous tracks. This stage serves as the movie's key element. Each story that is told on there is jazzed up by visual and of course auditory exhibits such as concert records, original tape-records, photographs from the musicians' private archives and authentic home movie cuttings. Additionally, the protagonists are accompanied by the camera when returning to places that mark important watersheds in the their lives. The Edge abducts the audience to Ireland. He wanders through his old school ""Mount Temple"", where his band U2 was formed, and stops by ""the War House"", where the rehearsal for the album War took place in 1983. Jack White, being the rookie of the three, looks back his life and still young career in an old, remote farmhouse in Tennessee. By choosing this location, the producer supports White's strong connection to plain, simple blues. The `guru' of the group, Jimmy Page, returns to Headley Grange in England, where today's highly praised 4th album of Led Zeppelin was recorded. The audience is privileged to get a guided tour through the hallowed halls that are responsible for the often imitated sound of the successful rock band.
Sitting together on the stage, taking a trip down memory lane, the artists talk about musical idols and inspirations, and their first steps as musicians, their ""rock `n' roll breastfeeding"" with Jimmy Page and Jack White introduce their favourite music including songs from Son House or Link Wray. Of course one topic must not be missing in the conversation: the guitar ""herself"". All of the three still know exactly when and where they got their first guitar that influenced their playing and future not only as musicians but also as individuals. Starting with the first guitar, being plastic or even home-made, via the first branded guitar to the first customized guitar, the audience gets the chance to listen to personal stories related to these ""women"". And beside stories about being renowned as obsessed, such anecdotes even include inventions like an integrated micro or Jimmy Page's famous double-neck guitar.
Showing the positive sides of a rocker's life, the negative facets of being a musician are not hidden in the rockumentary ""It Might Get Loud"". All artists bring up the matter of hard work not being paid off, failure and being savaged by critics. The audience is told that personal struggles and hard work is often closely connected to famous songs. While The Edge talks about personal depression, admitting that there was a long and hard way of ""sweat and labour"" behind the riffs of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", Jimmy Page recalls 3-lines newspaper-reviews he refused to read or even to look at them. Nevertheless, these aspects helped them to grow, or as Page says ""the spark became the flame and the flame was pretty bright"".
 When watching the movie, the audience gets the impression of being part of the conversation. Davis Guggenheim abandons technical knick-knacks and sets the focus on the protagonists, their music and the stories related to music and personal life. Sometimes, particularly in the old farmhouse in Tennessee, the viewer can actually get the impression that the film crew was even absent. When Jack White stamps the beat while playing the piano, the camera shakes as if standing on a tripod. Here Guggenheim shows his sensitivity towards `indirect' special effects. He creates an intimate atmosphere with a simple take where the audience can almost feel the shaking floor. Making the audience want to stamp the beat as well, the effect obtains the wished result without being too obvious.
 The choice of the three protagonists Jack White, The Edge and Jimmy Page proves as boon and pain. On the one hand they represent three generations of guitar players with special peculiarities. All of them try to bring in their talent into conversation. However, having three such strong characters seems to be a certain generational gap. The strong presence of Jimmy Page lets him appear as a teacher with Jack White and The Edge attending class. While The Edge turns out to be a model pupil, Jack White mimes the clown appearing sometimes bored and absent-minded.
 All in all ""It Might Get Loud"" is a successful contribution to the contemporary history of the art of playing the guitar, revealing facts and anecdotes that have not been known before. The audience gets the impression that the musicians are, most of the time, having fun playing their instruments, the camera going unnoticed. There are simply 3 generations, playing on six strings, talking about their one and only passion.",1277942400,,6032,5.133265513733469
3977537,2,B002RVZV9U,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought ""Oh, Boy!  This is just the movie for me!""  I love guitars, and rock music, and have followed the music of Page and The Edge for many years. I've built instruments, watched many rockumentaries. Sounded fascinating.

It isn't. First, the central concept of having these three guitarists get together and talk shop just never catches fire.  Page and The Edge may be brilliant people with a lot to say, but they don't say it in this film; they're deferential, introverted, and apparently just not motivated to engage in a lot of talk about what they do. Page seems like rock aristocracy with nothing to prove--true--and just hangs out, making benign, genial small talk.  The Edge talks about how he likes to make effects, which is fine, if not revelatory.

And then there's Jack White.  Many people have commented that he's the odd man out, not in the same league as the others as far as either musical prowess or influence, and I have to say, I agree, although it may reflect my being in an older generation than his fans.  But I found him very pretentious and peculiar, with his constant emphasis on how deeply into the blues he is, and how authentic he is, and how he plays plastic guitars, and wants making music to be a struggle.  He dresses up his mini-me son to look just like himself--looking like the Blues Brothers, and just as authentic.  Nothing wrong with being eccentric if you make great music--bring it on--but at least in this film he plays nothing to distinguish himself.

I expected these guys to at least talk with their music and play some interesting stuff together, but no.  Maybe it was unreasonable to expect, given how different their styles are, but still, I was surprised at how uninspired their jamming was.

Lacking any real chemistry, and any great musical interplay, the film includes a lot of archival footage.  Some of this interesting--I loved seeing Jimmy Page performing as a youth, and early U2 footage, in which they looked like the Bay City Rollers.  But I wouldn't say it was worth sitting through an otherwise slow, full-length film for those snippets.  I'd recommend this to hard-core fans only, and especially fans of Jack White, since any Zeppelin or U2 show is a lot more entertaining than this.",1277856000,7,2291,4.704260651629073
3977538,3,B002RVZV9U,"I will have to disagree with the last four-star reviewer who's review was titled ""Two Greats and One.....???""  He seems to think that Jack White is in the same iconic league as Jimmy Page.  What in God's name could he be thinking?  Jack White is a hack when it comes to playing guitar. So what? He can use a slide bar, big freakin' deal.  He sings like a girl and plays like a ninny.  I'm not even a blues-type guitarist; I'm a metal/folk guitarist/mandolinist, and I could out blues-riff and out blues-lick Jack White any day of the week.  After teaching him a thing or two about guitar-playing, I would have to rip that ridiculous hat off of his head and throw it in the rubbish with his ""plastic"" guitar and his ""plastic"" guitar playing as well. It's clearly evident that the only reason he is in the music business is because he just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Not only does he not belong in the same room as Jimmy Page, but he would have run home like a sissy girl if he had ever gone up against the likes of blues guitar players like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Dickey Betts, and Billy Gibbons.

The Edge admitted in the movie that he simplifies everything.  When he was showing his ""adjusted"" Major E chord, it was clear that he had removed the G# and the lower B (5th string 2nd fret).  The resulting chord sounded like all the other garbage that U2 has put out...tinny, sustained without body, and monotonous. I agree with ""Two Greats and One.....???"" in that I don't think I have ever heard him perform an awesome solo in any song he has ever done...and that's even within the safety net of recording in a studio.  It's all real banausic, straightforward, single-note, boring nonsense, and, by the way, ""The"" is a STUPID name. However, one aside about The Edge that puts him above Jack White--at least he has some humility when in the presence of a guitar master like Page. At least he seems to have some personality and it's clear that the music business fame hasn't gone to his head like the dork with the goofy hat, Mr. No Riff.

As far as the film itself, it's as flawed as a...well, as a flaw! There wasn't ANYONE to interview these guys, and they were left holding the ""interview mic"" themselves and certainly didn't do a very good job of it. What was the whole sequence about the child actor acting like a little Jack White about? That didn't fit into the scheme of things at all! And worst of all, what in the name of all that is holy were they linking Jimmy Page to a Fender Stratocaster for anyway? Sure, it may have been his first guitar, but they should have brought to light the acquisition of his first Gibson Les Paul instead. There was a reason Jimmy didn't keep playing Strats and moved to Les Pauls, and they missed it here.  One last question...Why, ""The Weight?""  Why would they pick a mid- to sub-standard song that relied more upon the lyrics and their presentation than the melody when doing a video about the guitar? Shouldn't the producers have picked a more blues guitar-based song for the three to perform together as a grand finale? How about something like Led Zeppelin's ""You Shook Me"" or ""The Lemon Song"" or even ""I Cant' Quit You, Babe?"" You know, ""All Right Now"" by Free would have been better than ""The Weight."" The production team just wasn't firing on all cylinders here.

Four stars for a very limited amount of Jimmy Page footage, minus one star for Jack ""No Riff"" White, and minus one-half star for The. The is a guitar player who simply cannot play a stylish solo, but does display a bit of modesty that keeps him far above Jack ""I Love Me"" White as a person. 2 1/2 stars.",1277164800,4,3667,4.429420505200595
3977539,4,B002RVZV9U,"I only have one question. What is Edge doing in this documentary? It's obvious from the start that Page and White are cut from the same cloth. Both are singular minded in their pursuit of blues based rock and pushing the boundaries as far as their imaginations can conceive. Both are great players and innovators. Edge?  Without his battery of effects and pedals couldn't play a blues riff if his life depended on it. It's clear throughout that Edge is the fifth wheel here and he's obviously out of place amongst these wizards of guitar and music. I've listened to U2 albums and I don't think I've ever heard anything that could be construed as a guitar solo or even a riff. Edge's playing is elementary though competent but nowhere near as innovative and captivating as either Page or White who stand in a class by themselves. By the end of this I felt sorry for ol' Mr. Evans because he was obviously out of his league here and had nothing to offer in comparison. Clearly U2 can write good pop songs but that's something that neither Page nor White could be bothered with. And frankly, neither can I. Here we have two greats with one wish-he-was. However, it's worth seeing for Pagey and Mr. White alone. Just fast forward through the Edge stuff unless you're into racks of special effects!",1277164800,2,1293,4.597402597402597

3977551,5,B002RVZV9U,"WEll I was a bit skeptical- how exciting could a ""documentary about the guitar"" be? Well, quite exciting, actually.
The true style and unique qualities of each guitarist really shine through. I've definitely developed a new appreciation for the Edge and Jack White through this film. The only downside of the film is that the Edge often looks very out of place. He's more of a musician and sound artist than a guitarist- he's not as skilled at the 6-string as White and Page.
In my opinion, Jimmy Page is the single best guitarist of all time, and it definitely showed in this documentary. The moment he lifted his guitar and began playing a few riffs, the Edge and White became the apprentices- learners trying to fit in with a seasoned master. Page himself is 66 now, but he can still shred like he could in the Zeppelin days. It is easy to tell from Pages white hair, permanent calmness and peaceful demeanor that he has totally mastered his craft.
The film is filled with music, and some great scenes. Among the most memorable scenes are those of Page's playing- including his incredible performance of Ramble On, Whole Lotta Love, and Battle for Evermore (on the mandolin). He's lost nothing with age.
The commentary by the three subjects of the film are articulate and poetic- supported by the astoniching music they've each created.
If you have any interest in the Edge, Jack White or Jimmy Page, you will do yourself a great favor by seeing this film. It far surpassed any of the highest expectations I could have possible had.",1276214400,,1535,4.688888888888889
3977552,4,B002RVZV9U,"A great idea for a film, executed well, with plenty of ""wow"" moments: Jimmy Page standing in the hallway where John Bonham recorded drums for ""When the Levee Breaks"", the Edge showing what the riff to ""Elevation"" sounds like with and without effects, and plenty more.

And then we have Jack White. While talented, he simply hasn't earned his place at this table. His self-absorbed posturing gets old immediately, and he isn't the visionary that Page and Edge are--there are no ""wow"" moments with White. He's treading recycled blues territory that Page and countless others already explored decades ago, and acts like he discovered it first.

There are so many other guitarists that would make a worthy complement to Page and Edge, and have a body of groundbreaking work to back it up, that I have to think the only reason for bringing White into this movie was to broaden the demographic scope, and obtain the most viewers: Page = Boomers, Edge = Gen X, White = Millennials.",1275696000,,974,4.791666666666667
3977553,2,B002RVZV9U,"As a guitarist and a huge fan of all three players this documentary focuses upon, I was ultimately disappointed in the film. I really can't understand the large number of 5-star reviews. Leading up to the release of the film, I was thrilled by the concept; these are definitely three iconic guitarists of their respective generations, and getting them together seems a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, other than getting them together, the film's creators don't seem to have had much of an idea of what to do with them once the cameras started rolling. With no interviewer serving to spur on discussion, Page, Edge, and White are left to figure out how to interview each other, and sadly don't do a very good job. It's very telling that so much of the film is actually recaps of each individual's career, with interviews done away from the ""summit"" that is ostensibly the centerpiece of the film. Given how uninteresting the actual summit footage is, it's really not surprising. There is a lot of awkward silence, abortive attempts to teach each other songs, and muddled discussion that never really goes anywhere. There are some interesting moments, such as when they are jamming a bit on Zep's ""In My Time of Dying"" and Edge takes a pretty cool solo... but they are outnumbered by the moments of awkwardness. This reaches its height when, at the end of the film, they manage to work up a rendition of ""The Weight"" by The Band, of all things. Utterly bizarre.

I also did not get the impression that the film's creators really knew a whole lot about guitar, which is allegedly the subject matter of the whole film. There's a sequence titled ""Jimmy's Strat"" which details Page's first electric guitar purchase. Page is so iconically linked to the Les Paul (and so rarely linked to the Fender Strat) that this just seems ridiculous. There's also this whole series of scenes featuring White and his 8-year-old self (i.e., a child actor), which, while kind of novel, seems gimmick-y and out of place. Again, I think it is patently obvious that there was little salvageable footage of the three together, and thus the film needed padding.

While not a total loss, the film is far less than it could have been. There's really nothing insightful here for guitarists, and the biographical info will be well known to anyone who is already a dedicated fan of the respective subjects. It was certainly worth a Netflix rental, but even as a massive Zep and U2 fan (and slightly less massive fan of White's), I am really in no hurry to pay money for this.

The filmmakers obviously wanted a rock guitar ""My Dinner with Andre."" What they ultimately produced is, at best, three unfinished episodes of ""Behind the Music"" crammed on to one disc.",1275696000,7,2727,4.761099365750528

3977555,4,B002RVZV9U,"I'm a huge Edge fan, but in the end, I found his part of this movie the least interesting, perhaps because I know much more about him and his musical evolution.  For me, the ""show"" was stolen by Jim Page and Jack White.  To see a living legend like Jimmy Page discuss what is was like to develop his sound was incredible.  Then, there is Jack White.  I'd never even heard of him (not my kinda music).  Yes, the guy has some serious attitude, but it's partly that attitude (and incredible musical talent) that draws you to him in some way.  You want to hear more, know more about his blues and raw rock.  No doubt some of White's ""attitude"" is just performance, but you can't escape the ""raw"" energy that the guy displays on screen.  For a pure music lover, this movie might be lacking, since the only music you really hear are snippets from this or that famous track, and a few you've probably never heard.  There are no complete performances.  So what's to like?  It's hard to put a finger on it.  I'm not particularly a guitar fan, but I thought this was a great DVD.  You know you liked it when you wished there was another 1-2 hours left when the credits start to roll.  That's the way I found this.  Very entertaining.",1274745600,2,1223,4.325991189427313

3977558,5,B002RVZV9U,"I grew up on Zeppelin and it is so wonderful to hear Jimmy Page talk about music and how it shaped him. Such a warm presence in this film. Some say that there isn't enough music in the movie, and I would disagree. I think there might be just a bit too much. I would rather hear them talk more. You know that Page alone must have days of stories to tell.

Jack White comes off as maybe a bit ostentatious in this grouping, but he has very real and original artistic talent. I have much more admiration for him after having seen this. And I think some of his airs are simply the effects of being included in such tremendous company.

The Edge gives some good first-hand background on the forming of U2. Their music in recent years has not captured me, as they've gone away from clean sounds and moved more toward electronic effects. But it's nice to hear him talk, even if maybe a third of what he has to say is about the various hardware he relies on for the effects that make their current sound.

It was very moving to see the warmth and respect each of these three afforded the others. However, it is very clear who the god among men is, and shivers went down my spine when Page stood up and ripped into the Whole Lotta Love riff. You can see the awe in the eyes of both The Edge and White. They truly look caught in the moment and unable to hide their sheer excitement like a kid on Christmas morning. To think that this riff is likely one of the first riffs either of the younger guitarists ever learned, and they're playing with The Man.",1274054400,,1542,4.220338983050848

But everyone else will probably be a bit bored as Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White discuss their love affairs with guitars. Page, of course, has by far the longest and most interesting bio of the three, while White, at age 34, is still evolving, and the Edge is concerned mainly with his many effects pedals and boxes to make his guitar sound like anything but. The three only jam a bit at the end on a Zep tune and one by The Band. That's when the movie is most interesting, although I really enjoyed one of the deleted scenes in which Page describes how he came up with the guitar riff on ""Kashmir,"" as the Edge looks on fascinated. White seems clearly less reverent about the other two than the Edge does toward Page. When you look back at who created what, however, it's clear that Page will probably leave the biggest legacy.

3977576,5,B002RVZV9U,"I enjoyed this video mostly because Jimmy Page was featured. When I first heard about this production and of what guitarists it featured, I didn't understand how either The Edge or Jack White could stand on a stage next to Jimmy. I wish Paul Gilbert, Jake E. Lee, Doug Aldrich, Gary Moore, Audley Freed, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, David Gilmour, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen (if he could stay clean) or any number of other true guitarists for the guitarist community could have been featured rather than Edge or Jack. Don't get me wrong; I like U2's music and appreciate the unique quality of The Edge's style but his playing could never be considered in the same league as that of Pagey. For the most part, I enjoyed Edge's parts in this film, particularly his modesty in afirming that his array of effects has much to do with his sound. Seeing he and Mr. White react to Jimmy whipping out a couple of timeless Zeppelin riffs was very cool and I appreciate the subtle respect paid to JP by both of these professional musicians. I appreciated Jack White as an artist a great deal more after seeing this film. Anyone in today's creative vacuum who has the guts to revisit late 60s to 70s blues guitar style gets at least some of my attention. It's pretty hard to come up with new creative techniques on guitar today but this film features a couple of Jack's creative 'inventions' that really impressed me. Quotes by all three musicians are thoughtful and encouraged me as a guitarist to enjoy the music creating experience for what it is at the moment and for what it does for it's creators emotionally. Led Zep received a great deal of criticism, especially with the first 4 albums and this was revisited. During different segments, the 3 play each other's music together and seem to have a good time with it. Each tells what his influences were when they were young and much of it was surprizing to me. If you are a fan of late 60's, 70s or 80s rock, any blues based rock or of the bands represented by any of these guitarists, you'll want to own this disk. I rented it first only because it appeared at the rental store when I had a free rental coming to me. Even after watching it twice, I had to buy it to keep in my library.

In particular, though, since I have heard of the great works of Edge and Jimmy Page, I was refreshed to see the intense lifeblood of music in Jack White.  I'm from the old school of Rock so perhaps I am jaded but I had not seen anyone of particular talent or inspiration until I saw Jack White on this DVD.  My faith in Rock music, even in music itself, was rewarded in the talents of this man.  I already know how talented Jimmy Paige is and Edge, yada yada yada BUT I saw something so new included into the mix, which made for a new Rock Music paradigm altogether for me.  When people leave out the likes of Stanley Jordan in their lists of best guitarists it usually just pisses me off.  Now I know that they must not leave out Jack White.  This dvd was so thoroughly entertaining that I really look forward to watching it time and time again, if only to see the instrument Jack White builds to make music.",1268784000,,1018,4.163265306122449

3977579,4,B002RVZV9U,"I like all three guys, and all three bands they are most famously known with.  While the obvious climax of a documentary about three guitarists is a jam session, I think it's a mistake to head in that direction.  I read here of guys who bemoan more music, less talk.  I also read about how this was a poor combination of guitar players.  While I may personally prefer a trifecta consisting of John McLaughlin, Lee Rinaldo, and Thor, the combo given in ""It May Get Loud"" made perfect sense to me.  In a way, it's really the story of how Page's legacy splits into two directions generations later.

How do I know this?  It's on their faces when they get together, talk shop, and trade riffs.  Jimmy Page's roots are in the Delta blues, which were born from Slave songs and prison work chants.  Jack White talked about that same raw soul that one hears in Son House, which led to Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf.  All Page's heroes as well.  The Edge, from a Brian Eno era, seems removed from it all.  Not in a bad way, but you can definitely see his blank expression when the other two go into it.  But the Edge is basically a logical progression of Page's electronic experimentation with the echoplex, theramin, bowed guitar, leslie speakers and recording studio tricks.  Jack White is the raw, soulful, bluesy side of Page's playing in Zeppelin and the Yardbirds.  When White is banging away at his guitar, you can definitely see how much more Page digs it.

The documentary tries to make this correlation, but not outwardly.  I think it gives enough ""scrapbook"" moments from each guy and each band to keep everyone happy.  For those cantankerous reviewers who grumble that there's not enough Jimmy Page and who in the world are those two other guys....careful....your age may be showing.

Besides, for any true lover of Jimmy Page's playing, I can't see why they won't love the other two blokes.",1268611200,23,1906,4.635820895522388
3977580,2,B002RVZV9U,"Because I don't care about the repercussions of negatively reviewing a popular movie: this film's organization was helter skelter and I feel as if I didn't learn anything more about the musicians featured creative processes, instead just rants about their obsession (the sound of the amplified guitar). Should have been more musician's stories, anecdotes, ""remember when's"", instead this flick was dressed up better than it was, much like the Edge's playing....(and what's up with Jack White's mini-me?)...Highlight of the film was a brief Meg White.

Credit to Page and Jack White who between the 2 of them did get one thing right...in the end it all comes down to the blues; the blues (and its several style forms) is perfect, its agitated, anti-establishment, its sweaty and chauvinistic, its cathartic, its sex and violence, its free flowing-individualism is the basis of rock and American music in general.

3977601,4,B002RVZV9U,"""It Might Get Loud"" is, at heart, a movie about the creative process that contrasts the process of three very different guitarists that are united by a gift for creating new and interesting sounds with one of the most simple of instruments- the guitar.  This is not a film about guitar craft, as such, nor does it propose that Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White are necessarily ""the best"" of their prospective generations.  This is not about the glories of fame and fortune or a gossipy dissection of sordid lives- this movie is a celebration of the artistic process that provides in equal measure the inspiration, work ethic and craft of creating something new.  What unites these three players is an artistic restlessness and a willingness to go outside the boundaries of what came before- the main criticism that I hear about this movie is- ""Yeah sure, Jimmy Page and The Edge but what is Jack White doing there?  He doesn't belong in the pantheon, not yet and probably never will.""- Well, Sir or Madame, I respectfully disagree- not only that but your criticism is beside that point- like I said earlier- this movie doesn't presume that these are ""The best of the best""- what ""It Might Get Loud"" sets out to do is contrast 3 different guitarist from 3 different generations who each have redefined the way people hear music through innovative approaches to the guitar.  It humanizes and demystifies it's subjects by first showing them in their native habitat and giving a thumbnail sketch of their backgrounds and musical inspirations- it then gets to the heart and main attraction- the 3 sitting together with nothing but their guitars and the result is, well, not explosive and that is kind of the point- any musician will recognize that situation and completely relate- what happens is what sometimes happens at parties or the beach or park- a couple of strangers with nothing in common but guitars sit for a little while and trade songs and talk about music- every musician has done this and to be a fly on the wall of this summit is to recognize the universality and brother/sisterhood of music- any musician can see this movie and say to themselves ""I may not be a big star- make records or tour the world but I am, in a small way, in the same club as these guys.""

3977610,5,B002RVZV9U,"""It Might Get Loud"" does the work of several documentaries. On its surface it's a staged meeting between three iconic guitarists from three distinct eras. But it's also three biographies in miniature of three individuals who were shaped by, and helped to shape, the music that we know as rock and roll. For purists there are tantalizing glimpses of musical inspiration, obscure and otherwise, and for those who simply love the look and sound of rock, there's enough detail about the guitar to delight anyone who's ever picked up a six string.

The match-up between Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White is by no means an even one, nor is it meant to be. Page, with his legendary status as session man, Yardbird, and mystical guitarist of Led Zeppelin, comes across as the most enviable of the three. He's got the riffs, the money, the fame and the aura of infallibility. Even in his advancing years his English gentleman's demeanor is still suffused with a youthful spirit. So when Page launches into his signature phrase from ""Whole Lotta Love,"" you can see how incredibly simple the structure is -- and how only Page can pull it off with the right feeling. But the film's brilliance lies in the way it shifts from one musician to the next. The Edge and White are clearly checking out Page's moves even as they betray their admiration (the look on their faces says it all). But soon the focus is on the Edge's restless, chiming sound from ""Sunday Bloody Sunday,"" or ""Where the Streets Have No Name,"" and you remember that in an era younger than Page's, another set of hands was shaping the sound of emotion and lyricism. The film goes beyond a potentially dry rendition of ""let's jam together for the camera"" to explore the places these three musicians came from. I liked that fact that, for the most part, the reminiscences are vivid and short. There's just enough historical detail to make it interesting, and just enough music (both archival and performed for the film) to keep you riveted.

As comparisons go, some may question why Jack White was included with the geniuses behind Led Zeppelin and U2. White's biographical sequences are contrivances (like his trek through rural Tennessee, speaking to his nine-year-old self in the back seat of a car) but they perhaps sum up what is both fantastical and challenging about becoming a guitar hero: the allure of playing to audiences, writing songs, and devoting oneself to music squared with the possibility of failure, hardship and a life of uncertainty and obscurity. Looking backwards at the success of these men, it's interesting to note where opportunity could have been missed: if Page had gone on with his session playing for another month, if the Edge hadn't met up with his future bandmates, if White hadn't heard his first blues song. So, whether one is a White Stripes fan or not, his contribution to the film must be seen as the work-in-progress, the young man with something to prove (and something to learn from the older guys). For all of White's private truculence, he clearly appreciates his time with the other men, and it's evident that all three share a love of the guitar.

The look of the film is gorgeous in many ways. The opening credits promise a ballsy, no-nonsense look at rock and roll's glitter and cool. The instruments paraded and played will make amateurs smile. The ordinary places where things ""happened"" (Headley Grange, where Zeppelin recorded several albums; the lonely scenery of Dublin where the Edge rehearsed with a fledgling U2; the Detroit streets where Jack White pounded out his first tunes) are to fans of rock what the Pyramids and the deserts of Africa are to archaeologists. This is where it all began. (See also Abbey Road in London...)
film, it's the truncated three-man jam of ""The Weight,"" the Band number that the guitarists feel their way through. The closing credits roll on early in the song, stealing some of the musical connection that was building. ""It Might Get Loud"" has no real discernible peaks -- it's not a concert film, or even a dramatic story -- but it does have a pace and a logic that makes sense given the three men who star in it. Viewers may engage in musical criticisms about who should have been included (Why not Clapton, or Gilmour, Townshend or either Beck? Why not Mark Knopfler versus Dickey Betts?) but that is part of the fun of it all, like baseball fantasy picks. This is a rare and very worthwhile look at music history.",1266883200,,4458,4.749677419354839

3977622,4,B002RVZV9U,"The thing about a movie like this is that it will never please everyone.  Some wanted more technical talk, but it's not a how-to video.  Some didn't like the choice of players presented.  If you think Guitar World's yearly top lists get hate mail, you can only imagine what happens with a film like this.  And it's not a concert film.

I thought the choice of guitarists was inspired.  Three generations of players, each whose art is a reaction to the others.  And each finding out that they come from common ground.  I have a love/hate relationship with Jack White's music.  I understand where he comes from, but some of it just doesn't grab me yet.  I love some of Edge's work in U2 and other stuff I find simple and repetitive.  Jimmy page is one of the main architects of ""the riff"" and has influenced millions of players.  But at the same time, he's kinda sloppy.

And that's what I find inspiring.  These guys aren't the greatest technicians on the instrument. Not virtuosos.  But masters of what they do, and always a student of the music.  They could have gotten super high end players like Clapton or Vai.  And that would certainly be an interesting conversation too, but very different from this one.

This isn't a ""how to play guitar"" movie.  It's a movie about how an artist finds their voice.  From Jimmy Page realizing that Muzak sessions couldn't be his future.  Or Jack White discovering the Flat Duo Jets and Son House and realizing that the deconstruction of music can be as important as its construction.

I think artists need to see this to see that their heroes are just as big a fans of music as they are.  And that they live what they do.  And that they don't have all the answers.  But they are looking for them.

And for music fans... If you want to see what happens inside a players head as he's creating and playing, this is a good place to start.",1266796800,,1874,4.454277286135693

In practice, however, the film is curiously flat and offers little illumination on the subject.

The problem is, of the three players interviewed, Jimmy Page and The Edge are more interesting when they're playing than when they're talking, and Jack White is more interesting talking than playing.  None of the three here is really captivating in both capacities.

I tried thinking what other players would have excelled both at playing and revealing insights about the allure and their own mastery of electric guitar.  Some names that came to mind, after much thought, were John Fogerty, the Boss, Chuck Berry, Neil Young, Pete Townshend, Les Paul, B.B. King (with Lucille), and maybe Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, or Buddy Guy.

Fans of Page, Edge, and White will enjoy their idols' segments here, but those seeking fresh revelations about the electric gee-tar will find considerably more inspiration watching the DVD of one of Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festivals.

I don't think this DVD is for everyone. It's not a concert. You really can't put it on and go about your business and listen around the house. To get anything out of it, it's something you really need to sit down and focus on.

It was satisfying to see the verbal interplay between them, as well as snippets of them informally jamming together.  Clearly, out of the 3, the world class 'guitar god' Jimmy Page deserved to be there the most.  He is, by far, the most innovative, progressive, and revered of the 3.  The Edge is a good player too, as he was in one of the bands that help propel the 'new wave' (as it was called then), or 'alternative' movement with his interesting playing.  And although I liked Jack White the personality, I couldn't help asking myself just what in God's name is Jack White doing up there with such accomplished veterans like Page and The Edge?!  In my opinion, as a guitarist, he is nothing special.  In fact, I find his playing extremely boring.  Even if you're into throwback blues and pared down playing, there are many who surpass him by far (Rory Gallagher, Roy Buchanan, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Robert Cray, etc.).

Yes, the structure and pacing was a deliberate choice (remarkable how much ""This is Spinal Tap"" has influenced both rock musicians, and rock documentary makers). Yes there was a bigger list of guitarists that the movie producers had considered. And Yes, there was a lot of music at the summit that never made it to theatrical release.

It might get Loud may not be the definitive rock documentary, but it is a good film about the relationship between the electric guitar and the artists who play it.

I followed the hype on-line for a year until the film was finally release and made its way to a theater 60 miles away. I made the drive and was incredibly underwhelmed by what I saw and heard.

I didn't care for the pacing or organization of the film... slow and disjointed. The selection of The Edge and Jack White must have been purely convenience motivated as there is a long list of more interesting electric guitarists whose inclusion would have made much more sense. The only shared performance was ""The Weight"" and I might add, they couldn't even get the chords right. Utterly embarrassing.

I've seen the process of how a bad film gets made in spite of the best intentions of those involved. My only guess is that this film went down that same road.

If it weren't for the scene of Jimmy Page in his music room listening to Link Wray's 1958 innovative bombshell ""The Rumble"", I couldn't even give this film 1 star.

 I liked the movie it was good, considering Jimmy was in it and hasn't done much work in recent years, and it was affordable. Seems anything remotely related to Jimmy is usually very expensive in recent years and unattainable for average folk. It was good to see a product that was affordable.

 The content was ok, the movie was too short and not enough technical information. This movie was geared towards guitar players, and yet most of the information provided was common sense knowledge...there wasn't any guitar technique revelations, so you could only watch it a couple times.
 I would have liked too see more explination of these artist key signature techniques.
 One would think, if you put 3 legends in a room together, that they would create a mind blowing sound, but that wasn't there either.

 It was good to see these 3 folks in a relaxed setting, along with their personal commentary. Showed their human side.

 I'd like to see them at a holiday family meal...do they eat like us?

The fact the U2 have stayed together over four decades is an amazing feat. I only wish I could have seen more! To watch Jack White and The Edge look on in awe as Mr. Page played the riffs of Zeppelin was classic! They looked like school boys watching one of their idols.

3977653,5,B002RVZV9U,"Sat on tenderhooks waiting for this DVD to arrive, and essentially it is a documentary on the guitar and its many sounds and influences over the years.  Of course as a U2 fan my interest was the Edge's effects pedals and how he invents his new sounds.  Not only did he show us, but it was refreshing to see the demonstration delivered with such humility and humour.  We were also treated to a tour of Mt. Temple School and the origins of the band, as well as some insights into the meaning of some of the songs.

Jimmy Paige was great in explaining some of the difficulties encountered by bands of the 70's era in trying to put down a quality recording and the stresses of touring whilst trying to re-create this music live.  He notes that the worst reviews they ever received just happenned to be on the album with the most unduring songs -Stairway to Heaven, Whole Lotta Love etc.

Jack White takes us back to his childhood, growing up in a large family with very little money, in a neighbourhood where you were outcast if you played guitar. He also demonstrated some very unique guitar inventions of his own.  As the youngest person on this documentary he insists he is still a 9 year old kid trying to find his own direction.  But it seems his directional influence goes back to the turn of the century blues artists who lived through some very tough times (to which he could easily relate).

If you have ever wondered what drives a person into a musical direction, this will shed some light.",1264118400,,1496,4.470588235294118
3977654,3,B002RVZV9U,"As a health professional by day and rock drummer/aficianado and musical archivist by night I highly anticipated the release of this documentary. Unfortunately my expectations were met with painful dissapointment. First and foremost, who picked Jack White to represent the new generation of guitarists? Jack White ( I am well versed in the White Stripes, Raconteurs and Dead Weather musical catalog ) isn't qualified to fetch Jimmy Pages coffee, much less play guitar within 1,000 miles of him! Jack White fixating on Son House was such a cliche. What rock guitarist wasn't heavily influenced by the early blues artists like Robert Johnson, Lead Belly, Blind Lemon etc., etc! Picking David Evans ( a.k.a. the Edge ) also was a huge blunder. Nothing personal against these two gentlemen as they seem like relatively  well-grounded, intelligent, generous and personable men. But, how about John Mayer or Derek Trucks  to represent the generation of guitarists who are both young and unlike Jack White highly proficient and musical on their instrument. How about Eddie Van Halen or Neil Schon, Steve Morse, Eric Johnson or Joe Satriani to represent the next generation. Again, nothing against the ""Edge"", ( both WAR /Joshua Tree were brilliant albums ) but C'mon he even acknowledges that his ""signature"" guitar voice has little to do with virtuosity on the instrument but everything to do with  layers on layers on layers of electronic ""effects""......neither of these guitarists had anything to add to the story. I recommend renting this documentary as listening and watching Jimmy Page ( who looks amazing for 66 years of age ) play ""Ramble On"" and being invited to his private record room as he plays air guitar like a kid to an old Link Ray tune! That is the only reason this reviewer gives three stars.

However, seeing the same old historical photos and performances from both isn't what I wanted. The focus should have been on them playing songs together, everything else just got in the way. Especially Jack whatever his name is. He was simply not on their level, just because he likes to experiment with making guitars doesn't make him that interesting or relevant. Not sure who would have been a good substitute, Eddie Van Halen or the late Stevie Ray Vaughn. But this movie went for a generational angle, but I didn't buy it.

3977656,5,B002RVZV9U,"First off if your somebody that starts off saying "" I've been playing guitar for blah blah blah and I like blah blah and don't like blah blah, and theres no music just talking""...your an idiot!!! This movie was very loud indeed. Sometimes whats being said is more powerful and moving than the volume in which it is said with. This movie is everything it says it is and more. From the very begining of the film it clearly states in writing on the screen three men get together to discuss the elctric guitar. Even Jimmy says they are supposed to have a chat and the instuments just happen to be there. This isn't some all star jam session or instructional video of Jimmy teaching the others how to play stairway to heaven. If this is what you expected you are going to be dissapointed and if it takes you untill the end of the movie to figure this out you were probably paying more attention to your musical ego than the movie itself.

So three men get together to discuss the electric guitar. They talk about their love, hate, history, influences, tatse, favorite makes and models, and much more all wrapped up in a warm blanket of chemistry between the three of them. Each man unique in his own light. To understand why these three were chosen is simple... they are different from eachother. By generation and by style. It would be quite boring having three guys all saying and playing the same thing. Each has a different story and background. Jimmys being very technical and creative, The Edge being very scientific in his persuit of a certain sound using hardware and effects, and Jack White who is a little harder to epxlain but it makes him all the more interesting, Ill just say the electric guitar is a constant struggle to him in his persuit of his inner sound.

Jack White does kinda seem like the odd man out at first. He may just be a little nervous about meeting the others, but after a bit he warms up to them. At one point Jimmy is showing him something on the guitar and you can tell by the look on Jacks face he is so humbled and happy to be in the presence of the others that hes trying not to break out a smile but he cant help it, much like a little kid that cant not smile. At the end of the movie they all enjoy a song together. Not some total rock out with the volume cranked to 11 but a simple acoustic piece that brings out the love for one another (which is kinda funny since the movie is supposed to be about electric guitar not acoustic). They all end up with that same little kid smile on their faces playing the song as the camera slowly zooms out and the credits scroll upwards. I had that same smile on my face as well.",1263686400,,2650,4.298

3977658,4,B002RVZV9U,"It's a good idea: three separate generations of rock guitarists sharing their love of the guitar, reminiscing about starting out, and then jamming. And the first two parts work nicely. Alas and sadly, the end jam goes nowhere fast and is rather anti-climactic. But by then I was picking along on an unplugged Strat, like any player who watches this is almost forced to do early on, and smiling at how much joy these stringed planks of wood have brought into my life. Famous or unknown, we all love that instrument dearly, and this love letter to it rings true despite its faults.

Still, any real fan of one or more of these guys will dig it, even if just for the pleasant tours through their past. I learned to play electric mainly from the riffs of Jimi and Jimmy, so walking through Page's guitar/instrument vault (good God, the Pauls he must have) was worth the viewing alone for me. Insert Tufnel reference here. He also comes off as a wise and gentlemanly fellow, and the tour through Headley Grange is a true treat for the Zep fans as he shows the hallway where Bonzo tracked Levee (which is also by far the most sampled drum sound in hip-hop, times ten).

I've never been a huge U2 fan, but I respect their stamina and love some of their early albums. I saw their Unforgettable Fire tour and was amazed at how Edge did so much with so little playing; as a minimalist he is a genius, I'll give him that. And he admits as much here, crediting his effects with most of his inspiration. He too comes off as a very decent fellow.

Jack White seems the odd man out; no legend by a long shot, his love of old school country blues is his only real link here to my mind, and he seems like a bit of a poser at times next to the relaxed demeanor of the other two. Still, he's a decent player, if hardly in Page's league (listen to the best Stripes/Raconteurs, then listen to Zep 3, 4, etc.). But he is the weak link here. I think he was included to get the ""alternative"" crowd into the theatre, but many other young players would have made more sense; Corgan might have been perfect, or even John Mayer, who can really play the blues when he feels like it.

But after all the trips down memory lane from each, the end jam is flaccid. Too many cooks produce little broth here; a rhythm section would have been a real treat, say Simon Phillips and Tal Oakenfeld, and the jam might have exploded a little or a lot. As it is, there's no major sparks, just some okay playing on one of Page's most derivative blues workouts, In My Time Of Dying, and a few other weak strolls through riffs by each, but never a well-paced full tune. A very typical rock jam, in fact!

But the highlight here might be when Page starts playing the uber-dinosaur riff from Whole Lotta Love (thank you Willie Dixon), and Edge jumps up from his chair to watch his fingers. You can almost see him and White thinking, ""Ah, it's in fifth and seventh position, no open E at the nut, wow, there it is, the classic great dumb riff of them all!"" That, and the generally artistic and intelligent tone, make It Might Get Loud well worth watching for fans of these guys, and the electric guitar in general. But if you're looking for smokin' geetar playing, get the Zep dvd set, or the latest Jeff Beck dvd, etc.

This film is more about the love of music than music itself...and that's just fine. Any film that lets a Zep fan sit with Page as he plays some of his favorite old records, smiling in glee (and wiping his nose over and over, some things never change!), well, that's a film made by a fellow who understands the hold that the electric guitar will always have.

If they remade this with Beck, Eddie V, and Corgan or Mayer, I'd hardly complain!",1263168000,,3711,4.346320346320346
3977659,4,B002RVZV9U,"Three men. Three musicians. Three icons. Two really good guitarists. And so you have the meat of ""It Might Get Loud"", the much anticipated ""movie"" starring Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White.

""It Might Get Loud"" tells the personal stories, in their own words, of three generations of electric guitar ""virtuosos"" The Edge (U2), Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), and Jack White (The White Stripes). However, the subtitle could easily be ""which one of these is not like the other"" as despite the film's attempt to give the viewer an inside look into the minds and hearts of unequivocal rock legends, the pace and feel of the film is overshadowed by what can only be described as a hiccup in casting.

Where it does succeed is in revealing how each musician developed his own unique sound and style of playing favorite instruments. The premise revolves around a day when Jimmy Page, Jack White, and The Edge first meet and sit down together to share their stories, teach each other famous riffs and play. From there the viewer sees breakaway scenes of each telling their personal story, air guitaring and remembering how they developed their craft.

Fans of Page and the Edge will not be disappointed as the film shows both in their elements - one surrounded by shelves of guitars, the other in a former school room and giving the viewer a very intimate and surprising, ""hey these guys are just doing what they love"" kind of feel to two of rock music's most recognizable and copied forces. Thankfully Page comes across as human and The Edge is depicted as having a soft side rarely seen on stage or video.

The aforementioned hiccup is Jack White. Admittedly, he is stretching musical boundaries but in terms of being a major contribution if he is to be this generation's greatest guitarist, someone needs to go back and recount the votes. White peaked with The Raconteurs, and while admittedly his work is experimental and w.o.p. (weird on purpose), it feels remarkably out of synch within the context of ""It Might Get Loud"". Out of the three guitarists White is the least original following in the footsteps of The Flat Duo Jets, The Ramones and nearly every underground Bluesman you've never heard of. Chances are within the next year he'll do a bad cover of Stairway and wear a knit cap.

Thankfully, ""It Might Get Loud"" rises above White's mediocrity and gives some real insight into some of rock's greatest legends; even if there are only two in this story.

3977660,4,B002RVZV9U,"... might actually be a better title. There is an undeniable charm to this film, even if White's pretentious preciousness gets under your skin, as it did mine, and that irrespective of his technical ability. One would expect an Irishman to be charming, but Dave Evans is all that and more. The Edge, free of the yapping Maw known as Bono, conveys an intelligent and humble regard for his craft that he saw as his only way out of an Irish economy that was devastatingly empty of promise. He is grateful to the schoolmaster who let them use a clasroom to rehaerse what they didn't know how to do, and archive footage of the lot of them as kids, contrasted with the footage of an overblown performance at Slane Castle presents their career trajectory in vivid detail. But it is his humble but intelligent regard for his job that strikes as so much more eloquent than the endless righteous babble of his vocalist. It's a great reminder that U2 has a lot more to say when Bono keeps his mouth shut.
Edge is clearly interested in what Jimmy Page has to say. In many respects U2 was part of rock's reaction to what Page stood for: corporate fueled excess. And yet, as Page tells his story, it is quite clear that he was very focused on advancing his craft and taking a tradition of rural and brutal and feral blues from teh American south into the hearts first of working class Brit kids and later to a much more inflated platform. But it is his fascination with what goes on inside the spaces between the six, 8 or 12 strings of his instruments, the historical precedents of his own interests that have fueld his imagination and the almost kismet occurence of events that changed teh course of his life. His first guitar was one that was left in the house into which his family moved after WW2. The house in which they recorded LZ4 offered them sonic ambiences that, while he incorrectly identifies as being the first use of such in rock music - Traffic and Fairport had already repaired to country homes, albeit more rural and humble, for seminal recordings - still alert you to the fact that for all the excesses on tour, when it came time to get to recording, it was very much artists exploring their craft.
It may be that the contrast between an Irishman and an Englishman generate subliminal messages, such as Edge driving his own car and Page being chauffeured, but each of them regards the other as essential to the dialogue of guitarcraft. Edge boils his tea in a modest kitchen and talks about his obsessions with the technologies of the guitar and the effects pedals, while Page waxes almost nostaligically over seminal recordings from his youth and offers a self effacing account that if you believed all that you read about him as a session player, you'd be convinced he played on absoluetly every record ever made. He is quite funny about film work that led to ""Goldfinger"" and Shirley Bassey passing out after the first take.
Between both men, there is a very serious and committed regard for preparing themselves so that the music plays them. While consummate enough as professionals, they have lost none of the innocence that infuses them with wonder.
In almost every frame White is clearly jarring or out of his element. There's no denying that he has talent to spare and a way of doing things, but there's also no denying that there is something quintessentially oblivious to that sacred innocence that Page and Edge still have. A sense of it all being contrived haunts his every utterance, and while he, like anyone else who attempts a life as a professional musician, has suffered disappointments as well as success, it could all be an absolute Ground Hog Day and start all over with nary a well placed toussled hair awry. While not exactly patronizing him, Page and Evans know they are someplace else, even as they all play together.
My guess is that they are two men who have attained an enlightenment that still eludes White, no matter how much he exactly nails a sound or technique. For all 3 men, music offered a way out of a life that none of them wanted to be stuck in, but in Page and Edge there is a recognition that the gods smiled kindly on them and that their good fortune lay in their ability to silence themsleves in just such a way that Music might lean over and take them into its confidence. At that point, it might indeed get loud.",1263168000,4,4363,4.559235668789809
3977661,4,B002RVZV9U,"Like most people learning the guitar, one of my earliest ambitions was to be able to play the intro to Stairway To Heaven, as played by Jimmy Page. So, if you're into the guitar at all, this dvd is well worth exploring.

It opens with Jack White constructing his own guitar from makeshift elements, and as it turns out The Edge as a kid also created his own electric guitar.  Jimmy Page got his first guitar when the previous owner of the house his family moved into left a guitar behind.

As you get further into this movie it gets more fascinating, as we explore the music the musical background, the development and creative influences of these three outstanding guitarists.  Particular highlights for me are the facial expressions and fascination of the other two as Jimmy Page plays the opening riff on Whole Lotta Love, and watching The Edge through the use of effects magic playing Pride, and giving the impression through the echo effect of playing two different instruments.  I also enjoyed Jack White's rendition of Take The Elevator, and he seems to be somehow channeling Johnny Depp. Jimmy also explains Kashmir and gives a quick demo.

I found my admiration for Jimmy Page in particular grew because not only is he a guitar great, he is also a cool guy.  The Edge impressed me with his dedication to pursuing the perfect sound, and reminded me of Les Paul in that respect in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Paul-Chasing-Sound/dp/B000QGE856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Paul - Chasing Sound</a>, a movie I highly recommend.  Jack White impressed me with his passion for the guitar.

I also enjoyed the concert footage excerpts particulary the soloing on the double neck guitar on Stairway To Heaven.
If you're like me you'll be impressed by the passion and dedication and talent of these three.  Some of the most interesting bits are in the deleted scenes and extended footage.

I hope you found this helpful, and think you will enjoy it.",1262995200,2,1999,5.064024390243903
3977662,5,B002RVZV9U,"I'm a music teacher in a public school, I have a Rock Band class and found out about the movie from one of my students.  I wasn't familiar with Jack White's music nor was I a huge fan of the Edge but as a devoted Zeppelin fan I was in it just to see the insights that Page would offer to the conversation.  Like another reviewer said, I was hooked, I didn't want to leave nor did I want them to leave.  I sat around and watched all the extras in the first sitting just trying to get them to stay around a little longer.  I brought the movie in to school and we watched it as a part of class. Even non-guitar players in the group really liked the movie more for the insights into the musical beginnings that each player offered.  The stories that the Edge told were an almost exact re-telling of the kids in our Rock Band, what a way to inspire new musicians!

The closet-groupie in me was psyched to get a glimpse at Jimmy's music rooms and a glimpse into his everyday life.  It really drew in the viewer in a way that no Zeppelin film ever could.  The early footage of the group recording at Headley Grange and of Jimmy in his session days was worth the price of admission.

Some complain about the selection of guitarists for this film. After watching it for the 3rd time I can understand why the 3 were chosen.  They weren't necessarily chosen for their technical skill but for what they've done for the guitar in their respective time periods.  Page was one of the innovators of rock guitar in the 60s and 70s, Edge was an innovator in his use of effects and creating that shimmering 80s sound.  Jack White just doesn't have much competition these days, sure plenty of folks are still playing guitar but many are emulating SRV or the sounds of Page, Beck, Clapton or Hendrix.  He'll get the younger generation involved and he's developing his own sound, just as the others had.

With all that said, I felt like there was a lot more I would have liked to have heard them talk about.  Some questions that us guitar players (who don't have our own guitar techs) would have liked to have heard the answers to as far as tone, amps, pickups, etc.  I'm sure these things weren't touched upon as much because the folks doing the talking already have that sort of thing figured out.  Maybe a sequel?  Just let me know, I've got plenty of topics for discussion in mind  ;-)

All in all a great movie and well worth a place in your library whether you're a guitarist, fan or someone looking to make it in the world of rock.",1262822400,8,2516,4.301486199575372
3977663,5,B002RVZV9U,"I loved this movie even as I agree with some of the negative comments.
My fav moment is when Page pulls the Link Wray Rumble single out and almost cries when it starts up. A tribute to the greatness that is Link Wray and a big kudo to the director for putting in the footage Of Link Wray playing. This glimpse of Page and his enthusiasm was unexpected and showed up several times and humanized him for me.
I thought there was a great balance between the individual stories and the time together. Each of the players showed their personalities. Ultimately each could be a movie in themselves. Jack as the young gun, overly self conscious at times and a mad genius when playing. His playing the records by The Flat Duo Jets and Son House show his respect for his influences and I totally disagree with the reviewer who says he ripped them off. Page ripped off more riffs than any other rock guitaist alive, but it doesn't make him any less great. When you really think about it The Edge may be the only one truly doing something unique here by not playing the white boy blues.
Bonus Clips are almost better than the movie. Kashmir and Seven Nation Army are both great. I loved the concentration on everyones face as they put it together. I definately felt the chemistry between Jack and Page. Both were very quick to pick up the others songs. It shouldn't be a surprise because of Page's session man background and Jack constantly collaborating with others. This was where The edge seemed out of his league. Anyone who can't hear the Zep influence in Jack's playing is not listening very hard. I always think people who liked Zep should like the White Stripes, but from a look at these reviews I see it's a pipe dream. The White Stripes are agrressive, raw, primitve and all over the place. Blues dragged through punk rock and self indulgent as hell.
The Edge is the Edge. His style never really overlaps either of the others yet when his guitar begins to ring out the Sunday Bloody Sunday chords and he reminds us of his punk rock influences it still demands respect. He seems to be really interested in exploring the guitar while holding onto his own style with a death grip.
Each player has his own baggage. Page appears gentlemanly until you remember about the ""Hammer of the Gods"" and how debased Rock stardom was from that era. The two younger players dismiss the generation before them yet stand in awe of Jimmy when he rips it up. Each rebelled against the generation before them yet they both wandered down ther own rabbit holes of technology and equipment for the Edge and ""authenticity"" for Jack.
I ultimately like the choice of guitarists, probably because I love the music of each and I like the generational aspect. The blues conection between Page and White is ultimately the most intersting part of the movie and would not have been there with different guitarists. I would love to hear those two make an album. Jimmy could use a little fire under his arse and Jack could focus his incredible talent.
Ultimately I want to thank the person who left Page his first guitar. Muldoon for playing and working with Jack White as an upholsterer and Larry Mullen Jr.for putting up the band notice to start U2. The world would be lacking a lot of great music otherwise.",1262736000,2,3273,4.568027210884353
3977664,5,B002RVZV9U,"This is my first review, but i felt I had to add my voice to those who have said how great this dvd is.  I watched it with my husband and daughter and we were mesmerized, could easily have set through a couple more hours of hearing them talk about their roots and their music.  My daughter is a huge Zep fan so she loved the parts with Jimmy Page, but what surprised us  was how much all of us enjoyed the Edge's part.  None of us were very familiar with Jack White, and except for the fact he was definitely channeling Johhny Depp, found him interesting too.  Have ordered the dvd from Amazon because I know this is one we'll want to watch more than once.",1262563200,2,656,4.133858267716535

3977666,5,B002RVZV9U,"I'd heard this was terrific, but it's so much more than that.  My husband, son and I were mesmerized watching it, it was just so good.  To see these three great, music-defining guitarists together, to see them riff together and enjoy each OTHER's contributions to music, to hear their own philosophy on music and where the music comes from for them (and it's totally different for each of them!) was an incredibly pleasurable experience.  I loved watching one of them take off on a piece of music, and you could see the other two intently watching what he was doing, copying it and then twisting it in their own style, and yet - they harmonized so beautifully together!  We loved it, absolutely loved it.  I'm glad we own it, we will be watching it again.",1262476800,2,755,4.562962962962963
3977667,5,B002RVZV9U,"I recieved this as a Christmas gift from my nieces and nephews (AWWW!!)
and I have watched it three times now to date and I love it!
What more can I say other than as both a musician and admirer of Jimmy Paige,
The Edge and Jack White's work, I found this to be a great interaction and you could
feel the mutual respect that each of these 3 decades of guitar giants had for each other.
When Paige broke into ""Whole Lotta Love"" and other classic Zeppelin stuff,
The Edge and Jack White both looked like Wayne & Garth in their basement headquarters
with wide-eyed gleeful grins saying AWESOME DUDE!!
Each individual guitar icon is given a platform for their backstory to be told
(for those who don't know already!) and we get to visit and view locations which
were crucial to their development. Alot of this I already knew, but for the youngsters
who are just learning about Paige, The Edge and Jack White, it's cool.
My summation: Plenty of good playing, conversation, backstory, etc.,
and I can't say anything better than what the other positive reviewers have already said.
A worthwhile DVD for guitar players and rock music lovers!
I liked it so much that I bought 4 extra copies this past
weekend to give to some musican friends of mine.",1262390400,8,1240,4.540178571428571

Hope they bend and are able to make a soundtrack, but with so many different music on this dvd, i'm sure it must be the hardest thing to get the rights to put all that music on the same cd. I, like many others was just starting to get into Jack White. I already loved Page and The Edge and thought i knew them, but this movie really introduces these guys(all three) to music lovers. It is fun and wonderful seeing the love of music these gentlemen have. I guess we all can think of other past, present and now guitarists that can be in these men's places in this movie, Carlos Santana, Eric Clapton and so on. But for whatever reason, these three just seem to have been able to hit it off, their chemistry together is a once in a lifetime happening with three greats. It is a wonderfully inspiring film, for music lovers all around. Thanks Mr. Page, The Edge and Mr. White for a lovely time and teaching us and showing us what true musicians really are.

3977669,3,B002RVZV9U,"I enjoyed this documentary from a historical perspective.  It was fun to see Jimmy Page as an old man reminiscing.  But I was hoping for more music, especially the LOUD kind given the title.  But there is very little actual playing, except for brief stints that are always cut off for more talking.  Talk, talk, talk.  I wanted to hear these guys play at least a few full uninterrupted songs.  Didn't happen.  Disappointing.",1262390400,8,424,4.726027397260274
3977670,5,B002RVZV9U,"I watched this dvd just this AM and what I saw was three important things  to me that defined the movie.

 1. Jack White IS talented and ,should be given more credit than he has gotten over the last few years.
2. The Edge is better at his craft then what I assumed. Not being a big U2 fan I was ready to blow him off as a guitar player. Not bad,not great but,not bad.
3. Jimmy Page is the man always has been ....always will be.

In watching the 3 converse on the sound stage in Cailf.was interesting to say the least. Jack seemed more at ease than Edge. Jimmy came off as relaxed and interesting. I found Jack W.kinda odd but,talented. Edge seemed oddly out of place. I don't know if he really belonged there. He seemed a little nervous in front of Jimmy. In fact I kept noticing that The Edge would rarely speak directly to Jimmy only to Jack.?

The footage of Jimmy as a hip young gunslinger in the session days of London was treat to see, brief though it may have been.see. It seemed as if all The Edge wanted to talk about was how bad it was in Ireland when he lived there. Jack'geniune awe and love of Son House was moving. He spoke of him in a reverence almost. Nice.

 Jimmy putting on an old 45 and step by step going thru the air guitar motions was like that Visa card commerical....""priceless"".His face just lite up.
 Oh yea when Jimmy starts playin' Whole lotta' love"" and the 2 just looking on in awe as if to say ...""holy S@%& this is Jimmy Page playing for us.""
 My favorite part however for me was the footage of Zeppelin at Headley Grange and,that Jimmy went back and walked amoung the ghosts of the past as it were.

 I think another reviewer put it best when they said Jack W. and The Edge were outgunned. Not having talent, charisma, intellect, respect or money to come close to Jimmy Page.
 I really enjoyed the film I belive the lack of sparks between the 3 was evident. If you are fan of any of these guitar players you owe to yourself to watch.

Lastly if Jimmy Page questions wheather you are playing in the right key...you might want to admint to being in the wrong Key.",1262304000,2,2096,4.223057644110276
3977671,2,B002RVZV9U,"First off, Jack White doesn't deserve a place in this film. Everything about his ""persona"" is irritating to me.

I like a few White Stripes and Ranconteurs songs... but overall, he's too over-rated for my tastes.

The whole child version of himself watching him play, dressed in similar clothes.... meh... Seems way too contrived.

When they finally get to meeting each other, it is cool to see them play their riffs in a group setting. Page playing Ramble On solo is a highlight for sure.

Edge is cool... he goes back through his demo tapes of riffs from Joshua Tree, but really nothing new if you have seen the Classic Albums JT dvd.

Overall a good rental I guess, but I wouldn't buy this for $20. Rent it first and decide for yourself.",1262304000,9,740,4.533834586466165
3977672,3,B002RVZV9U,"I was dying to see this, especially after reading a number of reviews here.  I heard so much about the scenes with the three of them together discussing and playing, but it turns out those scenes are maybe 10% of the movie, and the best ones are in the deleted scenes reel.  The rest is a poorly edited (scatter-shot, if you will) set of scenes where each musician talks about where they came from (e.g. Edge visits the school where U2 formed, or stock footage of Detroit with Jack White talking over the top).  The idea of hearing how these guys developed seems like it would be cool, but there's very little real information in these scenes.  If they release another disc of the three of them together just talking and jamming in the same room for 100% of the movie, I would buy that in a heartbeat.

This is basically three mini -life bios with a little footage of them together spread throughout.  There were some cool pieces but not $18 worth.  Also, if you are a fan of these three guitarists chances are you have already seen at least a few of the performances from other sources.  This disc reminds me of the history channel where they take a few experts, talk about the subject and intersperse some old clips or art.
I recommend Led's 2003 DVD and White's Black Pool Lights.

Page again..strumming the riffs of ""Friends"" on an old acoustic, playing on a National....and TEACHING the others how he developed ""Kashmir""...WOW...and there is much more...

Since this isn't a movie review but a DVD review....these bonus features add tremendously to the value for me of a DVD that contains a very fun and interesting film. I love guitar, have been playing it for 40 years and sure...I'd have liked to have seen other songs played, questions asked, but am I glad they made this...YES, am I glad I have it to watch whenever I want...absolutely.

3977676,2,B002RVZV9U,"As an amateur guitarist with a broad appreciation of rock music spanning every generation, I naturally found the concept of this film intriguing.  As for the three guitarist in this film, I would only consider myself a fan of Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin.  I like a number of U2 songs, but I would no way call myself a die hard.  As for Jack White, I am pretty familar with the White Strips and the Raconteurs, like some of his licks, but have always thought he was pretty overrated as a guitarist.  The fact that RS ranked him #17 all-time Guitarist is insane.  Anyways, as for the movie.  It lacked a lot of actual substance.  As much as I like Page, he was rather uninteresting and revealed very little about himself.  The Edge was disappointingly dull as well, in addition, he basically admits that his expensive gear gives him all of his sound, not his surprisingly lack-luster playing ability .  Jack White is the only guy who seems interesting or at least interested in the project.  Though, through his awkward ""Age 9 self with current self"" story telling method, it increasingly feels as his entire persona is forced and it trying very hard to seem like he doesn't care at all, if you know what I mean.  At one point in the film, he admits to copying his ""style"" from a 2-piece band he saw in North Carolina (name of band I cannot recall).  Also, there was actually very little guitar playing.  When there was any, it wasn't very inspiring.  There was maybe 15mins of good material in this entire movie.",1262044800,5,1511,4.527675276752768
3977677,3,B002RVZV9U,"I just watched ""It Might Get Loud"", a film by Davis Guggenheim (who also created Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"", a delicious slice of Grade A Propaganda if you ever get the chance!)  It's a profile of three contemporary guitarists: Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White. Each speak about their creative process, technique and influences.  The film looks great and held my attention but the same thought kept recurring...nothing against Jack White but why Jack White?  There are any number of others I would have preferred to see (Dick Dale, Robbie Robertson, Richard Thompson, Lindsey Buckingham, Joe Satriani), all who have far more history than Jack White.  Hopefully this will spark an interest in getting more of this kind of thing made, think Peter Gabriel, Tom Waits, Bowie, Byrne, and on and on.  These artists are only on this planet for a finite period of time.  It would be interesting to see how they work.  In summary, if you appreciate the work of these artists or if you just like guitars, you'll enjoy this film.  3/5",1262044800,2,1033,4.796610169491525
3977678,2,B002RVZV9U,"Judging from all the enthusiastically positive reviews of this film, I thought that there might be some kind of surprising chemistry or musical magic that occurred when these three very different guitarists got together--well, there wasn't much, as it turns out. The bio sketches of these three figures were interesting as separate clips, but the jam session/discussion was REALLY lame. It was just all too contrived. It was funny when Jack White was asked what was going to happen when the three guitarists got together and he answered ""Probably a fistfight."" Not likely, of course, but I expected a fistgight more than seeing the three guitarists sitting together and all three just plain ol' strumming the chords to ""The Weight."" Boring! Any one of them (or any novice guitarist, for that matter) could have handled that. What was the point? That song isn't in any of the three guitarists' reportoire, anyway. Couldn't they come up with some kind of jam that exemplified each of these three guitarists' individual styles? That happened to a slight extent on the ""In My Time of Dying"" jam, but overall the jams mostly just had them playing the same thing. And sorry, Edge just looked out of place playing a slide blues song, even if he did a fine job, of course.

And do any of these guys really care about what strings the other guys use? I'm sure none of them could care less, and in fact I think Jack White said that he really couldn't care less about what strings HE uses!

Yeah, this was just a goofy idea to have them sit around together and practically read a script for a discussion. The most fascinating parts of this video were the opening shot of Jack White making a miniature diddley bow, and the rare, very early footage of Page in his pre-Zeppelin days. Edge's soundcheck in the goofy ""living room"" was the most interesting part of the documentary in that setting (the ""discussion""), although it was just thrown in as an extra in the Special Features.

Watching Jack White write and record a song was cool, I guess, but the resulting piece was pretty much a throwaway tune, as I'm sure he would agree. I mean, how inspired are you going to be to write a song when some film director requests it and sticks a camera in your face while you do it?

This was a novel concept of filming this so-called ""informal"" dicussion, but it didn't generate anything interesting, IMO. Anything that is so contrived just isn't going to be natural, nor will it result in any real synergistic artistry. OVERHYPED.",1262044800,3,2510,4.684807256235827

You will leave with a much better understanding of why these 3 are so special and great choices.  A GREAT film for any fan of music but man if you play guitar you really gotta see this.  You'll be talking w/ your freinds about it for weeks.  The Blu Ray is particicularly good looking (and understated in the soundstaging as well).

together playing and interacting. It's okay but not what was promised in the trailers. Many of the things they express I've seen on youtube and magazines

Whether or not the Edge or Jack White is a great guitar player is a matter of opinion. One thing is obvious. These three have almost nothing in common and it shows. There's lots of biographical clips but no complete songs. The fact that Page isn't going to sing on any of his bits explains their brevity.

3977684,5,B002RVZV9U,"In 2009, the documentary ""It Might Get Loud"" directed by David Guggenheim (""Gossip"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"") made its way through the various film festivals.

The documentary was created to highlight the electric guitar, so what best than to feature three iconic electric guitar musicians: Jimmy Page (The Yard Birds, Led Zeppelin), The Edge (""U2') and Jack White (White Stripes, The Raconteurs).  Each men with different musical backgrounds and from different countries and get to know how they became passionate for the electric guitar, learning of their musical inspirations, revisiting areas where they first became involved in their bands, footage of them performing live (with vintage footage) and their approach to music, what goes behind-the-scenes when they are writing songs and much more.

The documentary captures these musicians up-close and personal but also what happens when you bring these three musicians together with their instruments and what kind of music they come up with together.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""It Might Get Loud"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The picture quality is fantastic.  The documentary was shot in HD and aside from the vintage footage and old photos, the modern footage was shot entirely in HD and the amount of detail is just wonderful.  You literally see the detail in some of the vintage instruments.  For example, in one scene, Jack White performs a song on the piano and you can see the rugged look of the old piano.  Especially later on as he performs on an older guitar.

You do see quite a bit of grain on some of the stock footage and of course, older vintage footage is not exactly going to be the best looking on Blu-ray but for the most part, picture quality is quite solid for the modern sequences of this documentary.  Skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep.  Some modern scenes has its share of low light noise and I did notice certain scenes with occasional dust but for the most part, picture quality is solid!

Audio quality is presented in English, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1.  Lossless audio is fantastic!  From when you first hear Jack White messing around with a guitar, that the electric guitar comes out quite clear through the front channels.  But when you start hearing Jimmy Page and The Edge play and the followed by Jack White and the various bands, you can't help but be impressed about the clarity of the instruments.

I can't tell you that by watching these guys play, especially when Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White just sat together and then started jamming, you can't help but get goose bumps.  Absolutely fantastic!  Especially the final improvisation scene with all three men just jamming.  Just brilliant!  There was no rehearsal, these three guys just start jamming in unison.  Awesome!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic.

JUDGMENT CALL:

An incredible and amazing documentary.

For anyone who enjoys rock n' roll especially these talented guitarists such as legend Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White will love this film.  I was pretty amazed about how enjoyable this documentary turned out to be.  Learning about their passion for the electric guitar, playing music, learning about their past and also footage of their bands (vintage footage of Led Zeppelin and U2) was pretty awesome.

But what really made things much more enjoyable was watching ""It Might Get Loud"" on Blu-ray.  The film was shot in HD and the detail was just amazing.  From the old vintage instruments, you literally see the age on them and the various locations where the documentary were shot looks quite impressive.  The lossless audio was fantastic and to hear the three perform and hear the guitar so crystal clear and so well-defined through your home theater is quite amazing.

This documentary goes beyond just enjoying the music and historic information from Page, The Edge and White, you also get to see other classic footage of artists and bands that these musicians enjoyed.  Seeing 1930's Blues artists to punk bands such as The Clash and the Ramones was pretty awesome.  But there are some deep thoughts from the musicians that you can't help but listen.  This is probably one of the most personal rock documentaries as we see the thought process behind the music, their first instruments, the challenges they faced earlier in their career or at a young age and more.

I know there are some people who wish there was more music and less talk but personally, I was amazed by hearing their stories.  Yes, I enjoy listening to their music but to tell you the truth, aside from listening to their music, I never knew the personal side to these men.  Director Guggenheim let these men do their thing and I know some wish there was more prodding by the director but this was a different type of documentary that Guggenheim wanted to accomplish and so, it's less about ego's or personal clashes, it's all about the love of music.  So, I found this documentary to be quite fascinating and just highly entertaining.

Also, the special features were just enjoyable to watch.  The fact that these three musicians allowed the filmmakers to get up close and capture the personal side of them was quite amazing and when all is done, the special features showcase some enjoyable scenes as Jimmy Page plays the guitar and The Edge and Jack White are just in awe by the legend.  You can tell that these musicians savored the moment, especially when the three start jamming with Jimmy Page while he plays ""Kashmir"".

Overall, if you are a rock musician or a fan of any of these talents or the bands they are part of, ""It Might Get Loud"" is a magnificent documentary worth owning on Blu-ray.

""It Might Get Loud"" on Blu-ray definitely receives my highest recommendation!",1261440000,10,6876,5.015887025595763
3977685,5,B002RVZV9U,"We are entering an era, I feel, in which some names in the arts will remain constant in history, while some will slowly fade out - even if their music has, perhaps, the same quality. That is what I felt when I watched ""It Might Get Loud,"" an illuminating and penetrating documentary about three guitarists of importance in present times: Jimmy Page, David ""The Edge"" Howell Evans, and John Anthony Gillis (aka Jack White).

Although the film begins by telling us that ""on January 23, 2008, three musicians came together to discuss the electric guitar,"" we are in for much, much more. The guitarists do get together, but in between the takes of the meeting, we are shown historical footage of their careers. It is also a get-together of three generations of masters of the electric guitar, if you will: Page was born in 1944, The Edge on 1961, and White in 1975. White is the only one born in the United States (Detroit), while Page and The Edge were born in areas adjacent to London. White, being the youngest of the trio, says, before the meeting, that he wanted to ""trick them into teaching me all their tricks."" Whether or not he succeeded, will go with him to the grave.

For my taste, I mostly enjoyed the scenes of the film in which the guitarists are shown in their own environments, before they got together. They discuss, almost in detail, their musical influences, and we see some footage and hear some of the music of the artists that influenced them. This is pure gold, I think. We see them playing some chords of some of the recordings that they admire, and they talk about their guitars, including their very first one. We follow them throughout their evolution as musicians, when, for example, Page was a member of Mickey Finn and the Blue Men, Carter Lewis and the Southerners, the Yardbirds, and, of course, Led Zeppelin. We see White performing with his sister (at the drums), the Raconteurs, and the White Stripes. We also enjoy them performing in concerts, including U2's ""Where the Street Have No Name."" When they get together, they play parts of their songs, like ""I will follow,"" ""Whole Lotta Love,"" and ""Dead leaves and the Dirty Ground."" Interestingly, they perform these tunes with their electric guitars. At the end, however, they sit down at a different location inside the soundstage, and play with acoustic guitars.

""It Might get Loud"" is an important document of our times, and, as I said at the beginning, I got a felling that one of the guitarist portrayed in this film will be remembered forever, one may survive the test of time, and one will probably be almost forgotten. When they play together, you can feel the nervousness and some degree of discomfort - maybe because there are too many people around, as well as cameras. However, they do synchronize their efforts the best possible way, given the fact that they have probably never been together before. It's all for history. By the way, it was The Edge, who at one point in the film, while practicing at an undisclosed location, says, ""It Might get loud for a second,"" which probably got the film its title. The DVD also includes deleted scenes; commentary by director Davis Guggenheim, and producers Lesley Chilcott and Thomas Tull, and more.  (USA, 2008, color and B&W, 98 min plus additional materials)

Sure, the screen is smaller but 1) You can go back and see the parts that you you want to see (and even zoom in on the performers fingers) and 2) You get to see the ""Deleted scenes"". (Read on about those.)

This documentary was directed by Davis Guggenheim who won lots of awards for directing Al Gore in ""An Inconvenient Truth"". (To make Al Gore seem interesting for two hours, talking about global warming was a challenge that Guggenheim overcame.)

The premise is that the Director got three electric guitar geniuses from differejnt cultures and generations in to room to reminisce and play together. Jimmy Page (British) is the elder statesman here; The Edge from U2 (Irish) comes next in the age-line; and Jack White of The White Stripes (Detroit, MI) brings it into the 21st Century.

What I expected to see was a ""super session"" in one room for 98 minutes. But that's not what you get. The Director used this ""first time meeting"" as a jumping off point to follow the careers of the three men, jumping from one to the other. There really isn't much footage in the film of the meeting and no complete songs are ever presented. (If you read the credits there are nearly 100 (!) songs excerpted for the soundtrack. There's lots of archival clips of Page in his various bands and Edge and White in their respective musical collaborations as well. But it's still riveting.

The DVD includes commentary by the Director and Producer (none of the musicians included) and a 30-minute Press Conference in Toronto that does include Page, White and Edge. But then there ar4e the ""Deleted Scenes"" - 12 of them totaling 26 minutes. It's here we see Page play acoustically for a full song, some on stage jamming and questioning each other and even a section where Edge reveals how he  - and Bono - got their unique names. (Why wasn't this in the film?).

This is a min-history of the electric guitar from the mid 1960s to the present and anyone who plays electric guitar will get something from it.

3977687,5,B002RVZV9U,"When I heard this documentary was out, I was itching to see it and then I got delayed. I started getting worried but I checked the theater and they still had it running once a day. HURRAY I wouldn't miss it and was going that day. THE GUITAR GENIUSES WERE PLAYING & I WAS SEEING THEM! And let me tell you, it was everything I expected and MORE!

I am a longtime U2 fan and WHO ISN'T a Led Zeppelin fan??  Jack White is kind of new to me, but the film is going for past, present and future generations of rock guitar expertise and that is exactly what is achieved. As another reviewer expressed, it is quite a thing to see the faces of Edge & White marveling at what Page is talking about, playing etc. He IS the GOD up there in the trio, who can make the guitar do things no one else I've ever heard yet do since Page has run his fingers across guitar strings.  NO ONE.  There are many, many truly talented guitar players out there who I would include in a list WITH Page, but Page set the bar HIGH ENOUGH for all these other players to try and reach for; he made them want to be THAT GOOD. And a small handful ARE that good.  BECAUSE of Page.

Now I've heard people diss Edge, saying he wasn't much a guitar player etc.  Well, I'm a HUGE HUGE U2 fan and so I ALREADY know what Edge can do and how he does it. He creates multiple guitar parts for one song; he hears it all in his head, uses several guitars in one song, and blends all the parts together to combine an AMAZINGLY masterful blend of guitar parts to express himself in JUST ONE SONG!  He, like a symphony writer, hears all the parts of what he wants to write and with his guitars and MASSIVE pedal board, creates magnificent sounds that are TRULY UNIQUE and unmatchable by anyone else in rock today.  AND ONE MORE THING: Edge CAN DO A ROCKIN' MAD GUITAR SOLO ANYTIME HE WANTS TO.......his skills are mad crazy.

Jack White - that opening sequence of him making that scant guitar is something else........truly poetic and his scenes are proof of what is yet to come and of how much he has already done.  I wasn't as familiar with his work as I was with the other but I knew who the White Stripes were and WOW are they great.  Dude is most righteously talented and for a young man, has a keen interest and understanding of the blues. That usually takes years to possess/acquire. But he already has it.  He has proven he can spread his talent across many different bands, but I think it would befit him to settle down and suit up with one and let it rock.  He did look truly awe-inspired in watching Page & Edge (not just patronizing - he seemed genuine) and looked to be soaking it all up. These guys have made it to the BIG SHOW!!  And I am sure that is where Jack would surely like to be at some point.  He has time to experiment now; but to be a master, you have to get your sound and rock it out like there's no tomorrow.  I am sure he will.

Like the others, I did not want this to end.  Seeing them all play together was LIKE A DREAM. And do it on slide......oh wow, what a moment.  Hearing Edge tell them all, ""no it's a B Minor"" (again to all the Edge nay-sayers, the dude knows music) as they are jamming together, I mean, this is a ""never going to happen again"" moment and it was a ""goose bump"" moment watching as they all sit together with instruments in hand, taking turns or playing together, eyes riveted on one another.  I can tell they all had fun making this - there was JOY in there eyes and in their music. There was JOY IN ME.

If you love these guys, if you love guitars, if you love rock music - GET THIS!!!",1257379200,19,3590,4.1205164992826395
3977688,5,B002RVZV9U,"It's hard to put into words just how riveting this documentary is. If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin, U2, or Jack White (who I had never heard of before this film) you will want to watch this over and over. Some of the coolest parts: watching the Edge as he listens to old tape of U2 giving birth to a song, complete with Bono faintly counting time in the background; watching Jimmy Page put a 45 on a turntable and play air guitar in his home to one of his early influences - the 1958 hit The Rumble; watching Jack White build an electric guitar in the opening scene, and just being delighted overall at this ""young"" guy's appreciation for the blues and his talent as a musician.

My favorite band is Led Zeppelin, my wife's is U2, so this film would have had to absolutely fall on its face for us to not like it. But even as excited as we were, as high as our expectations were, and as much as this film had to live up to in our eyes, it did, and more!",1257379200,52,953,4.042328042328043
3977689,5,B002RVZV9U,"I also saw this in a theater and when it was over, it was clear no one wanted to leave the room, we all would have been content to spend the rest of the afternoon and evening with these 3 guys. One of my fav moments is when Jimmy Page starts the opening notes of Whole Lotta Love - the looks on the Edge's face, and Jack White's face in particular are priceless: they are trying to maintain you know, professional demeanor, but inside they're going ""OMG it's Jimmy Page playing Whole Lotta Love!!!!"" I am buying this for a bunch of people on my list, and a copy for me too, to watch all over again.",1257379200,98,598,4.119658119658119
3977690,5,B002RVZV9U,"I caught this limited release documentary in the theater and cannot wait to see it again and to gift it to every guitar-loving friend I know.

""It Might Get Loud"" is ridiculously, thunderously, deliciously good.  If you love music, if you love guitars, if you love the creative process, you'll love watching while the boys pull back the curtain on their first guitars, on falling in love with music and on how it all comes together.

Some of the highlights; the Edge at the bulletin board where he first spotted 'Larry's' ad for musicians, the grown-up Jack White talking to little Jack White and getting to see Jimmy's face light up when he starts talking about the music.  It's all just fabulous.

And when it was all over, I was just so glad that I play the guitar-- until I remembered, uh... I don't.  But they do.  And their enthusiasm and appreciation is just so infectious, you'll be running home to grab your imaginary Fender.",1257379200,29,934,4.624242424242424

Jimi & Jack are great educators as well! Highlight: ""Who Needs A Guitar"" -Jack White... rigs up some nails in a board, adds a bottle, a 1 coil pickup, plugs in and gives some really dirty slide... an old soul in a young mans carcass, and then there's Jimi Page, enjoy as he... well, being the aged mystic and goes into relax the facts mode.
