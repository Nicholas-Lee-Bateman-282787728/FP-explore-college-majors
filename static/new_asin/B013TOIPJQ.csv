7373503,1,B013TOIPJQ,"I'm actually ashamed to have rented this. We thought it would be a fun, indie documentary about a founding father. Instead it's a bizarre, poorly produced rant against liberals. Whatever your political leanings, if you're looking for an education in history, I don't imagine this is what you're seeking.",1459209600,6,303,5.204081632653061

7373505,1,B013TOIPJQ,This is truly awful.  Don't think this is a way to get a Hamilton Musical fix if you can't go see the show.  Terrible right wing nonsense... and poorly produced,1458432000,3,160,4.3

8728771,1,B013TOIPJQ,"TERRIBLE, DEPLORABLE!! Very opinionated to say the very least. Possibly produced as propaganda only. Having studied the life of Hamilton and our Founding Fathers over the past, say, 50 years, I was SHOCKED when I began watching/listening to this DVD, and I became appalled the further I continued with this DVD. This producer's professional pedigree is a peradventure for sure.",1506470400,2,377,5.3

8728776,1,B013TOIPJQ,"This is not a review as much as a warning.  It is nothing more than a dismally produced rant against ""the North"" and the Democratic Party in favor of States' Rights.  The viewer is constantly reminded of the ignorance of the people who produced it through phrases like ""over top of"" (meaning 'above').  The underlying theme is that Hamilton forced everyone into the current form of government by misinterpreting the Constitution and conspiring with the nine New England states against the four southern states.  They even make the statement that America is divided into two races of whites; the northern 'Anglo Saxons' and the southern 'Celts.'",1474070400,4,644,5.047169811320755

8728778,1,B013TOIPJQ,"This is a very low budget, ill informed video about an American Founder.  What a waste of time and money.  Do not buy this insipid, American hating video.  It is slow, boring, and preaching.  Go see the musical and enjoy yourself, and learn the truth about this great American.",1471737600,5,277,4.591836734693878
