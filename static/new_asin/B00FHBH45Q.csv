I loved Ye Jin Son and Nam Gil Kim as the leads, they had sublime chemistry together, and I loved their younger counterpart actors! Never before have I seen two young actors who so perfectly capture the physical and emotional characteristics of the adult actors. Also, the cinematography was lustrous and enchanting, some of the images were like paintings! I would freeze the images just to STARE at them! The OST was also beautiful and haunting. The K-drama of Shark falls under the radar unfairly, and needs more exposure! It's dynamite! One of the best. Great classic romantic storytelling.",1393804800,2,723,4.934426229508197

Beautifully acted and splendidly written, Shark tells the story of a young man determined to seek revenge on those who wronged him.  I don't want to give too much of the plot away a it unfolds with many unexpected twists and turns.  The story keeps you guessing as different aspects of past and present are revealed.  The romantic chemistry between the leads (both in their teen and adult personas) is exceptional, as is the original sound track.  Superior to almost anything you can find on American television.  If you like dramas that make you both cheer and cry, you will love this one.",1393459200,2,667,4.6581196581196584
