2616559,5,B000GRUVVK,"This video demonstrates how to sit, how to place your hands, ect.  in a way that is down-to-earth. The problem with books on technique is they can't demonstrate what they attempt to describe. Having a video like this, I think, is therefore indispensable.",1327536000,11,254,4.906976744186046

8134119,5,B000GRUVVK,"I recently began taking lessons on the classical guitar.

My teacher has been very patient, trying to get me to improve my right-hand technique, but there were a few key concepts I just wasn't getting.

Looking for additional resources, I stumbled across this DVD, and found it to be IMMENSELY useful in helping me to understand the fundamentals of right hand and left hand techniques in classical guitar.

Kanengiser has a very clear, understandable approach to teaching you not only the ""hows"", but the ""why's"" of basic classical guitar technique, basing his teachings on the fundamental rules of anatomy and kinesiology that govern how our hands and arms work, with the objective of teaching you how to play the guitar in the most relaxed and natural fashion possible.  This is where the ""Effortless"" part of the title comes from, not that learning any instrument is ""effortless"", but that if you follow the principles in this DVD, you will not have to fight bad habits that can make good technique more difficult.  Kanengiser uses a number of creative visual aids to help you understand the relationship between your fingers and the strings.  He also projects a kind of congenial warmth and good humor that makes it enjoyable to watch the DVD a few times over.

After watching this DVD a few times through, and working through the examples and exercises given, I made significant improvements, especially in the right hand, improving both speed and tone, and feeling far less hand cramping after an extended practice session.  Well worth the money for the beginning classical guitarist.

The material contained on the DVD is very similar to that on Scott Tenant's ""Pumping Nylon"" DVD. I feel that Kanengiser does a better job at explaining certain things than Tenant (especially right hand position and the muscle control you should use to pluck the strings), although if you purchased both, you would find that they are complementary to each other.",1328400000,32,1953,4.984615384615385
