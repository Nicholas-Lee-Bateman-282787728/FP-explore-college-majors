The funniest things is i've got an original which i lost it since i was 5 years old and its was in Thai version but the sound track and every single songs was exactly the same as the original.  I just wonder why they decided to change and cut some part on this vol., trust me its extremely stupid boring !!!!  I cant believe they did it to every person who like this animation; for example cinderella, sleeping beauty, the last unicorn and.... etc  they still kept as it original and they still won't change anything even it comes as a new version !!!  people who decided to buy this animation (i means in this version ""stories from my childhood Vol. 2"") please DO NOT buy it because u will worth for nothing but extremely disappointed !!!

Dear executive producer Mikhail Baryshnikov Oleg Vidov Joan Borsten and others who in charge on this animation, I'm not satisfy at all on this version!!  This extraordinary award winning animation shouldn't been changed like this, i swear to GOD!!!  You all did a horrible job and rule through all of this fantastic beautiful story !!!

At last this animation (this version Not the original one) now became as a CHEAP award winning by my elimination !!!, worse compliment to all producer on this version !!

7888532,1,6305340579,Story is great but this version has different voices and the songs are changed. Somehow it ruins the whole thing if you loved the 1977 version. Got this as a gift and was immensely disappointed. I hope someday the 1977 version will be made as DVD.,1307836800,,247,4.391304347826087

7888534,1,6305340579,"This was really a waste of my time and money. The voice-overs were poor, they couldn't even vaguely sync the english speech. I'd reccomend all viewers to watch the original Russian versions instead. There really isn't anything notable or special about this ""collection...""",1257552000,2,272,5.348837209302325

7888537,2,6305340579,"I was so excited to finally get a copy of Ivan and His Magic Pony on DVD, but ended up disappointed. I own the original on VHS and the DVD does not do it justice. Yes, the animation is the same but the dialog has changed. The songs alone are very different. I wish someone would just make a DVD version that is not different from the original. A childhood dream ruined.",1102377600,21,369,4.138888888888889
7888538,4,6305340579,"I am Russian (OK, Belarussian, to be precise), and grew up watching these wonderful cartoons. They are fantastic! Without mindless violence (Japanimation!), fairly slow-paced, no pretentious grandeur (Disney of the  90's!) - they are done in the tradition of Dumbo, Bambi, Snowwhite. The  only thing which absolutely devastated me - where is the original dialog in  Russian? Why delete it from the original (at an additional expense, I  guess)? That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.",945216000,21,490,5.1645569620253164
