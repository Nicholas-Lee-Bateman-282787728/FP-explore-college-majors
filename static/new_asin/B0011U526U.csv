8242333,1,B0011U526U,Not what I expected - don't like that it is dubbed in English. Greek was what I wanted.,1472774400,,87,3.888888888888889
8242334,3,B0011U526U,cutie idea.  It is a musical so that slows it but it is slow compared to today standards.  It is an dubbed movie to english.,1469836800,,124,3.92
8242335,1,B0011U526U,"This thing's got Dub's disease, who knows how dumbed down the dialogue is for American audience's? This offends me greatly that the distributors thought it needed to be simplified for an American audience, however I could be wrong and it's just as simple in it's original language.",1449273600,,281,5.0
8242336,1,B0011U526U,The sound was behind the lip movement. It was disappointing. We stop watching it after a few minutes. Save your money. :(,1446249600,,121,4.545454545454546
8242337,3,B0011U526U,Picture quality not good.,1424390400,,25,5.5
8242338,1,B0011U526U,"This is a copy of the original movie with Greek spoken, so the quality of the scenes was a bit poor. No nice sharp picture. I have kept it since I could play it on my current dvd player. And I guess my children would get a kick as they don't speak Greek and they know I'm an Aliki fan.",1424217600,,285,3.7666666666666666
8242339,5,B0011U526U,I am 63 and when I was 18 I saw this movie. Brought back fond memories of summer vacations in Greece.,1375401600,,101,3.857142857142857
8242340,3,B0011U526U,"It's an amusing little story, and you can watch it in english
and be entertained. The problem here is not so much in a cultural barrier as
in the way the movie is dubbed: Hollywood-bland and given stock readings
that take the life out of it. To make it even blander they have taken some liberties with the script... in the one section I saw, where the girl and guy
 have a somewhat thoughtful exchange, it's turned it into Hollywood pablum..
So here's your choice: you can watch Alice in the Navy and listen to
this poor actress trying, or not at all trying, to be Aliki Vougiouklaki
 or you can go on E-Bay and order a movie called Aliki sto Naftiko and hear the marvelous inimitable Aliki herself along with the excellent Greek cast.
 Make sure you specify sub-titles, of course..
  I only reviewed this because I hate to see it get one star..and it's a
little unfair to blame a movie entitled ""Alice in the Navy"" for the fact
that it's not in Greek.",1348704000,4,952,4.386363636363637
8242341,1,B0011U526U,"I have seen this video before and I expected it to be in greek not in english-I wish it was clear that it was dubbed very badly.
Very disappointing.",1209340800,,148,4.137931034482759
