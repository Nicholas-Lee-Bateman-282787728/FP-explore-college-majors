8063266,5,B0009ML2NS,"Loved this great movie about the famous ""Battle of the Sexes"" tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs.  It's really very close to the actual events and was based on personal recollections from Billie Jean herself. Both Holly Hunter and Ron Silver are terrific and very credible in their roles.  I also recently saw the newest movie version of that life-changing match, called ""Battle of the Sexes"" with Emma Stone and Steve Carrell, and it's also a great movie, worth watching !",1525219200,,492,4.845238095238095

8063273,4,B0009ML2NS,I love Holly Hunter and I think it's an important look at the what the match meant to raising consciousness of women gaining equality in tennis. It was like coming out the dark ages. Holly makes good films that mean something to our lives.,1386720000,,239,4.454545454545454
8063274,5,B0009ML2NS,"If you were old enough to have watched this match, this movie will bring back the emotions of that night.  It beautifully captures the pomp, the media overkill, the anxiety of the time.  If you are too young to have seen the match, this movie will give a good shot at what it was like when men and women were trying to reinvent their roles in society.  It's not stuffy, it doesn't lecture, this movie is fun and true to the time.",1364428800,3,429,4.2073170731707314
8063275,5,B0009ML2NS,"Watching this movie made me relive the King-Riggs tournament like it was yesterday.  Every detail was period perfect, and the movie matched the exact tone of wit that surrounded that spectacle (or should I say 'circus'?).  In fact, this movie gave a lot more depth to it.  Those of us who lived through that spectacle only saw the 'pig' side of Riggs, which he played up for all it was worth (a hell of a lot in terms of money!).  This film shows the sweet side of the guy, and the fact that he just wanted to feel like he could still compete at his age.  I actually felt as much sadness for him when he lost, as I felt extreme joy when Billie won.  I have to give director Jane Anderson a lot of credit because she didn't play up that final shot into the net that lost the match for Bobby.  I was watching this with three other people and we all started to scream, but the film remained quiet for several seconds.  It made us focus on the fact that it not about 'who's better on the court', it's about a feeling of accomplishment - a moment of dignity that echoes to this day.  Holly Hunter is just too great for words in this, but I'd match this up there with another film of hers that has the same energy and audacious sense of humor: The Positively True Adventures of the Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.  Ron Silver did an amazing job of showing us that Riggs was in fact, not a cartoon.  And more kudos again to Jane Anderson for writing a script that used humor to approach a subject that still divides people almost as much today as it did thirty years ago  (I loved the titles at the beginning which read, ""this was a time when feminism was a dirty word""!).  This is the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite some time!",1163548800,9,1734,4.23404255319149
