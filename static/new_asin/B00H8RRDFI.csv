6141664,5,B00H8RRDFI,"I write this rating of Robert Peng's Master Key Video Series because the whole western world can benefit from learning to know this
initially unbelievable but now well proven powerful process to achieve good health and good lifetime living skills.
Purely and simply Master Peng shows us how to understand and utilise their own inner mind infinite powers (as contained within every human living body) to practically and simply progress towards becoming  complete Masters of their own destiny.
The most powerful information and healing system known to mankind should be required primary learning for all medical trainees of any description and all is well explained in these videos with numerous practical demonstration as to how to simply learn, practise and achieve your own maximum potential for life.
Thank you Master Peng.",1398124800,16,825,5.297709923664122
6141665,5,B00H8RRDFI,"These videos are superb.  Robert Peng exudes inner peace and balance as he guides you through qigong - exercises for cultivating inner power, harmony and wisdom. He speaks with a resonant, hypnotic voice. The video has just perfect special effects to help you with visualization.

You will learn how to project energy through your fingers with a Sword Finger technique, how to create a qi ball, how to build the energy in your lower, middle and upper dan tian, how to balance the energy through the central meridian.  You will learn an amazingly beautiful Lotus meditation, and much more.

While you can use these videos on their own, you can get even more out of them if you also read the Master Key book.  If you get the book in a digital format, you'll find there links which will take you to the SoundTrue website where you can view the video clips.  I have purchased these videos through the links in the book, where they are available in downloadable format.  You can also view video samples on youtube.",1394323200,27,1009,4.634831460674158

8630972,4,B00H8RRDFI,"I think this material is very simple and straight forward.  I like Robert Peng's soft gentle peacefulness which to me, is a true sign of a inner spirit Qi master.  There are many Qi masters out there and each has their own system or style of working with the Infinite Energy.  Robert's system seems to be gentle and pure, without force or abstract stylization.  He also seems to have a radiant personality which disarms the ego.  The exercises are easy to do and contain within them the possibility for higher development the more you work with them.  These feel more like very beginner exercises.  However, even so, they have potential to enhance one's own energy and inner power.  Robert outlines them so that once you learn them, he gives a monthly program and an annual program so you can build your Qi progressively over time.  That is where these ""beginner"" type exercises becomes something very dynamic.  One does not need to have a system be difficult or complex to be powerfully effective.  There is computer graphic animation overlayed in the movements to help you visualize what the energy or Qi is supposed to do.  These graphics are excellent to help know exactly what to do.  This series has beautiful peaceful settings and music to help the person adjust quickly into the mood and purpose of the exercises.  Robert does the exercises in the timing that a normal work session would take so for those who need to have the ""Just push play"" as a motivation to follow along to get the job done, this DVD set will work for you.

I gave this series four stars (actually, I would say I give it 4.25 stars!)  instead of five for a couple of reasons.  One, the visual graphics show up for an instant and then disappear.  Then the rest of the exercise shows Robert doing the moves without the graphics.  I think having more of the graphics for longer periods of time, particularly for people who need to see the visuals as training aids for their imagination, would have been very helpful.  I think it should have had a bit more of these visual aids for longer periods of time through the exercises.  The other reason is that for the price (and the home website of this course is expensive!) there could have been more content in the series.  The DVD's run on and on with Robert just standing there or sitting with his eyes closed, or going through the Qi Gong moves nice and steady as in a real-time workout.  Nice, like I said above, if you need to have him take you by the hand to do all the exercises.  I would have preferred much more exercises and demonstrations with the additional instruction to do these for a certain amount of repetitions or amount of time or whatever.  However, I think if you do the see and do method, you will always feel like you aren't doing this on your own by yourself.  I think more content could have been fit into these four DVD's.  It is called ""Master Key"" and perhaps some bonus exercises would have been helpful.

Once you have these down, practice, practice, practice.  Robert goes through and assigns different exercises each week from the DVD set.  He said the first 100 days are essential to gain the best benefit.  But the one-year program is clearly outlined.  I started working with this system and felt great energy within the first exercise but I am not new to Qi Gong or martial arts so this was a nice refreshing activity.  And much nicer and tranquil than other systems.

Does it work?  Is your preception ready?:

On the first day I tried his technique, I practiced making a Qi ball, even while driving my car.  I did several sets of 9 while at the stop lights.  I did this all day as I went about my business.  That night, I made a Qi ball and held it over my husband's hand and he said it felt magnetic and very warm, almost hot.  He said the vibration was very strong.  When I pulled my hands away, he said the energy radiation was still thick and heavy in his palm.

The second time I tried something was today in a restaurant.  It was a very busy restaurant with only one guy working the floor, rushing about waiting on tables and trying to put together to-go orders while answering phones, etc.  He started to help me and then got tied up with so many other things.  I waited patiently for quite a while, hoping to finish my to-go order when he had a spare moment.  After some long and reasonable time had passed, I realized he must have forgotten about me.  I looked at him from way across the other end of the restaurant.  Then I imagined the wonderful glowing Qi pearl go from my head to his head, connected by a soft golden electrical discharge of light.  IMMEDIATELY, the guy turned and locked his eyes right onto mine and came rushing over to me, apologizing that he had forgotten.  He then finished putting together my order.

I don't think these exercises are made to ""play"" with although some ""playing"" can certainly test your own development here and there.  I personally work with energy systems and Qi as a way to balance my own energy system and to help smooth out my energy fields.  I also find it helpful in keeping my own energy systems strong while working with other clients who need healing and energy work.  I even use it to send perfect strangers some positive love because the universe is full of love and free energy.

One of the most important points I should mention is that you have to be less concerned with ""sensation"" and more acceptance of ""knowing"".  Knowing that you are a life force of inifinite energy and that you, the Earth, and the cosmos, are made of the same stuff.  It is free for the asking and you do not need to barter or manipulate or do anything gain it.  IT is a gift, ready for you to draw upon any time. Essentially, we do not heal anyone - rather, the Infinite Energy that moves through all things is available for healing.  So don't try so hard to ""help"" others.  Rather, enjoy your own growth and development until you get to a point where personal motivations simply go by the wayside and you do it because you are energy playing in the fields of energy.  This release of expectations actually releases the Qi from you and helps you link up with the Infinite Energy Qi.

I think Robert Peng has a great series whether you are a beginner or have had other experience in energy development.  What makes his Qi system so nice is that he has a very gentle personality and brings a person down into the peaceful bubble of consciousness immediately.  His methods are straight forward and anyone can learn it easily.

 Peace, and good luck!",1447372800,26,6549,4.480980557903635
8630973,5,B00H8RRDFI,"Robert is an amazing Qi Gong teacher and I could feel the power in this, the first time I tried it. How about your right fingers suddenly longer than the other and the taste of charged liquid is different after being energized and this is only the first video. After many years of Bhakti, Karma and Raja Yoga and working with the Prana energy, I'm finally learning to use it to heal my body and strengthen my mind. I knew the energy was there in me since I had a Kundalini experience a year ago but it was negative because I had not learned to control this massive energy and if you don't learn to control and use it properly it can really mess you up, mentally and physically.

The other teacher I'm learning from is Zhongxian Wu and I'm learning Chinese Shamanic Cosmic Orbit Qigong (book and DVD) and his ""Seeking the Spirit of the Book of Change: 8 Days to Mastering a Shamanic Yijing (I Ching) Prediction System"" as well as ""The Secret of the Golden Flower""
Thomas Cleary translation. The Secret of the Golden Flower will help you go into Wj  the void of nothingness and everything without description also called the Tao. Wj is the original source of everything, it is the best place to power-up Chi in the Dantian's. The key is a proper diet of no artificial sugars like High fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners, staying away from processed foods and fast food (which is very unhealthy due to the people making it and the inhumane animals slaughtering factories the meat comes from) all of these cause a severe loss of Chi in the body. Remember, mind body, spirit, all go together. Besides this DVD series and book and the other 3 books and DVD I suggested. Robert also has some excellent videos on his YouTube page. My best advice is get a healthy diet, meditate twice a day (5-10) minutes is better than nothing but increase to twice a day for 30 min each, practice Qi Gong at least once a day, twice is better and forget about more books and teachers than what I recommend, chasing Masters and too much intellectual information is counter productive, the connecting with the Wj or Tao in meditation will give you all the real knowledge and wisdom you need in life. Blessings to all of you!",1444780800,13,2208,4.503740648379052
