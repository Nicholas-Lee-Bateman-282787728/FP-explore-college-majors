7929253,5,B000050Y6S,"This video opened my eyes to the total devastation of the 1927 Mississippi River Flood. Actual footage of the flood waters was used to display the utter destruction. Beyond the sad plight of those affected was the story of political intrigue surrounding the city of New Orleans at this time. A section of land more than a hundred square miles in diameter was sacrificed and its people displaced in order for the great city to be spared. The people were never recompensed for their loss despite promises from the governor's office.

In the days prior to the New Deal, this video shows the beginnings of governmental compassion as thousands of people were displaced from their homes and a feeding program was put into place for the refugees. This video is a ""must see"" for those who live along the great Mississippi Valley and its tributaries, as well as those interested in the history of the 20th century in America.",1118275200,,916,4.761006289308176
