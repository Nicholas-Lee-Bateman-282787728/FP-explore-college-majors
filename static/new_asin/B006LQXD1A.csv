8500498,4,B006LQXD1A,"This is one of those films that I was not expecting great shakes from but was pleasantly surprised in the end. It stars Damien de Montemas as Bernard (Warrior King' and `The Secret Life of Us), we first meet him when he is teaching piano. He lives in a remote part of Australia with no neighbours and just his dog Zach for company. After returning home he is jumped by some well dressed masked intruders. They bind him and then force an overdose of sleeping pills down his throat.

They are five mates and have just come from a funeral of Alice who links the whole band together. They are looking for revenge and have hit upon this idea as the answer as it is the perfect murder; that is it will look like a suicide, they even write his farewell note. Problem is he wakes up and in the turmoil of what they are going to do next, the past is revealed in a very different light than some of the friends had been maintaining, but the problem is who or what to believe.

This is in no way a horror, it is unpleasant in places, especially so for Bernard, who is getting all the blame for Alice's death as he is seen as a philandering sex pest. The direction of Michael Henry in his big screen debut has managed to get some really excellent performances from all concerned, no one is black and white and as the film unfolds they are all developed or exposed in different ways. The dog is ruddy good too. It gets to the stage where you are not sure who is the victim and it pretty much manages to keep that tension ramped up for the whole 86 minutes.

So all in all a fine debut and, a bit of praise must go to Screen Australia for co funding this project. This has not had a lot of money spent on it and it just shows that you don't need it with a good story and some genuine talent. Wanted to give it five but it is really a very solid four stars.",1373068800,2,1842,4.111111111111111
