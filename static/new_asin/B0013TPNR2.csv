8252849,4,B0013TPNR2,"If you're like me, you've been skeptical that you could really learn anything from some DVD art tutorial. But I decided to take a chance on ""Comic Book Coloring with Steve Firchow"" and was not disappointed. In an entertaining, detailed, and surprisingly quick moving 3-hour tutorial (yes, that's right - 3 hours!) Firchow (known for his superlative coloring work on a number of Image Comics' Top Cow comic book titles) takes you from the very first step to the last of coloring a brilliant piece of comic art penciled by Dave Finch and inked by Joe Weems.

As I mentioned earlier, this tutorial is 3 hours. How it is set up is Firchow was recorded coloring the piece (he notes that it took him 13 hours), and in the video he is narrating the footage, which is greatly sped up to make it 3 hours. While it might seem that the tutorial would move too fast, in reality it works very well, and Firchow proves himself an able and entertaining teacher. It should be noted, though, that this is not a DVD in the traditional sense - it is less a movie than a computer program: the tutorial itself is in Quicktime and I don't think it will play on a conventional DVD player. I play it on my MacBook and it works just fine. If you don't have Quicktime on you computer, don't worry - the disc has a link on it so you can download it.

The Good: A brilliant tutorial. I've been teaching myself how to do computer coloring out of books for a few years now, and a number of Firchow's techniques either I'd never heard of, or I'd never tried because they seemed too difficult. Having seen him do them on screen, with his clear explanations, makes me realize they're actually not all that difficult. He shows how to use gradients to establish base colors, how to adjust colors to continually try them out as you work, how to use textures in your work, how to paint faces and hair, etc., etc. etc. There's hardly an important topic in computer coloring he doesn't touch on. Also, the disc comes with great extras: printable lecture notes (these aren't especially extensive, but helpful), digital files of the artwork and textures used in the tutorial so you can try your hand at coloring on your own, and even Firchow's own custom Photoshop color swatches!

The Bad: This isn't necessarily a criticism, but this isn't for beginners. If you've never colored anything in a comic book style in Photoshop before, you will get lost fairly quickly. Firchow (as well he should) assumes the viewer has some experience with Photoshop and a graphics tablet and so doesn't explain any of the rudiments or basic controls. This DVD is fairly advanced, so I would suggest that any beginning computer colorist start off with the excellent tutorial books (which come with lessons on a DVD-ROM you do right along with the book)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hi-Fi-Color-For-Comics-Digital-Techniques-for-Professional-Results/dp/1581809921/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hi-Fi Color For Comics: Digital Techniques for Professional Results</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-Digital-Color-Styles-Tools-Techniques/dp/160061759X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master Digital Color: Styles Tools Techniques</a>. These will actually teach you to master some of the beginning techniques that Firchow uses and builds on in the tutorial. Another problem: the price. This DVD is pretty expensive, but I think the expense is worth the benefit, and I can tell you this won't be the last Gnomon Workshop DVD I'll buy.

I recommend this DVD tutorial to any aspiring comic book colorist with a little experience behind them. Enjoy!",1277251200,6,3686,5.21079258010118
