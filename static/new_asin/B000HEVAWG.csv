They appeared simply too immature to form a cohesive unit with all the members of the party.  The woman that was with them, Andria Bellon, received the brunt of their pouty baby behavior because that felt she should feed them more food even though she was tasked with rationing so they would have enough to get through the journey- GROW UP GUYS- she had a job to do and was willing to do it to save your rears even if you disliked her for doing so- that made her a natural leader. She was probably the only member who would have had the mental strength to actually have made it had this taken place in the 1800's. They all could have began hunting for more food instead of putting that off.  It was like watching a bunch of whiny kids, except for Andria who would complain but then appear to do some soul searching and come out stronger and less complaining.",1504137600,,964,4.314917127071824
8139047,2,B000HEVAWG,"The men in this were pathetic and about as ungallant as you can get. If there had a different bunch of men with some dignity the series might have been great! As it is it was a waste of time and one of if not the worst ""historical"" reality series I've seen and I have watched all of them that I can find. Try something like the BBC's Coal House, Nat Geo's Pioneers, and Frontier House they are all much better than this one.",1424822400,2,424,4.059523809523809

8139049,3,B000HEVAWG,"They were okay and enticing to watch as a 4 part series.  The scale and effort of the journey were well conveyed.  It was also interesting to see how it was done.  The only criticism I would have was that the modern day context of the journey was not altogether cohesive.  I thought the participants were a bit far removed from the context of this 21st Century re-enactment of the Trail and members of the group tended to choose whether they were in the past or in the future.  Basically apart from the odd group dynamics thingies, fine.",1173312000,3,537,4.438775510204081
