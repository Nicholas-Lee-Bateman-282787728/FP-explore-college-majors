8342025,4,B001TLWPQ6,"This is a really nice video emphasizing lunging to warm up your horse in the correct form. I have never used lunging to create the form I wish to ride in, so it is an interesting addition to my training. Barbier has a thick accent but is very understandable. ""Intimacy"" is a good term for what you see on this dvd. It is a beautiful, respectful way to train and bond with your horse and I enjoyed watching it. I love dressage and this is a good way to learn to visualize your form and execution. I didn't give it more stars because the dvd is so incredibly overpriced. I will have to wait until money is falling from the sky to buy the second set but I'm glad I own the first two dvd's.",1286841600,,686,4.088888888888889
