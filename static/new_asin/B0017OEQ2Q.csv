Ain't seen it, but thought this would be helpful.
I'd rather lose $2 than $20 if it really is sucky.",1391299200,,331,7.487179487179487
8266680,1,B0017OEQ2Q,"Worst how to video ever. I bought this because I figured it would teach me more than YouTube. I was wrong. If only I'd have known it was sooooo easy
1. Cut a limb
2. Carve "" oh here let me show you my tools
3. There's no set measurements
And looky here I made a bow",1381622400,3,265,3.6666666666666665
8266681,5,B0017OEQ2Q,I followed the book's instruction and created a fine working bow. Book will be a part of my library on primitive bow making,1362528000,,123,4.391304347826087
8266682,1,B0017OEQ2Q,I would not recommend this video to anyone who's serious about building a Holemegaard bow. The example given is a poor representation. The tillering sequence leaves much to be desired. Don't waste your money.,1358812800,,208,5.147058823529412
8266683,2,B0017OEQ2Q,"The title is about building the HOLMEGAARD bow but a lot of the work is done on a kids english style longbow. VERY little information about the dimensions of the HOLMEGAARD bow.
Very amature production qualities.
Glad I paid the 1.99 to rent and not the 9.99 to purchase.
There is better info out there on building this style of bow.",1268697600,8,333,4.475409836065574
