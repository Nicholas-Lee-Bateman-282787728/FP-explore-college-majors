We all know that Wagner's operas are not for the faint-hearted, but for anyone wishing to know something more about these huge works of art before actually sitting down and watching a full Wagner opera, this DVD certainly shows how various artists who took the plunge, responded to it and became the richer for it.  I highly recommend it.",1346371200,,403,4.661971830985915
8057181,5,B00094OB34,"Wolfgang Wagner, the late director of the Bayreuth Festival made the best choice of his long career when he invited conductor Pierre Boulez and then young director Patrice Chreau to produce a new production of Wagner's ""Ring' in 1976, one hundred years after the birth of this unique master piece. Boulez and Chreau constructed a completely new concept of the piece in which  human characters and growth of mankind, critically viewed by Wagner on how civilization had not succeeded to make mankind any better, gave a merciless, part tragic, part very humorous, portrait in which the spectators could recognize themselves. the first year, 1976 drew negative reactions from the usually very conservative Bayreuth audiences but soon after that it became the absolute hit of the century. The film on ""The making of the Ring' is an unforgettable document on how this historic event in Bayreuth became a milestone in opera and TV history. This film is a must if you have the complete ring on DVD and if not, you must immediately buy it!

8057182,3,B00094OB34,"The documentary on this DVD is included as one of the extras on the new Deutsche Grammophon release of the Boulez Ring. If you already have this version of the Ring, don't bother to buy ""The making of..."".

I have the earlier release from Philips, which doesn't include the documentary, so I felt it might be worth buying this DVD, if only for completeness. It was worth the money, but...

If you're expecting a documentary of the same calibre as 'The Golden Ring', you will be disappointed. Quite frankly, it's a bit of a pot-boiler; there isn't much about the actual performance - most of the film is a potted history of Bayreuth, including the near-obligatory scenes of Winifred and the Nazis, overlaid with an appalling oompa-band arrangement of Siegfried. If you're a keen Wagnerian, you'll know this stuff already; if you are not, you won't be interested in this DVD.

On the other hand, there are sound bytes from the performers,  shots of Boulez and Chereau, some stock footage of Wieland and Wolfgang that I've never seen before (and the price is less than a reasonable bottle of Riesling), so.... why not.",1129248000,33,1115,4.761658031088083
