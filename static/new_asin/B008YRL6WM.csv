5191226,5,B008YRL6WM,"Hellsing is the story of a vampire, the Hellsing Organization and a police woman.  The Police Woman that gets caught up in a war between two real vampires.  Arucard and Incognito are the major vampires and with them is the British Empire's dry but always funny policewoman  (Bloody Hell) all part of the Hellsing Organization's efforts to make a bleeding mess of things.  If you Love early Anime without  all the computer CGI that can be just a little to much.  I have been watching anime since 1963 and other than Freezing this is hands down the best bloody anime.",1355875200,4,565,4.6
5191227,5,B008YRL6WM,One of the best anime's out there. Now that I'm older my taste has changed. But I still love this anime. Buy this if you love great anime's,1354752000,4,139,4.0
5191228,5,B008YRL6WM,This is the original Hellsing series before the Ultimate series begain (which is still on going).  The art work is more life like and not as stylized as the Ultimate series (still good).  The story is good (but ends with questions - see Hellsing Ultimate).  The story deals more with the begining of the series (character development).  This with Hellsing ultimate works together.  It is still a great blu-ray to get.  Enjoy it.,1354752000,6,428,4.794520547945205
5191229,5,B008YRL6WM,"I came across the original Hellsing on late-night cable a number of years ago.  I couldn't stop watching, and I am NOT a fan of anime.  I do love 'supernatural' things like vampires, zombies, etc, so this was interesting and a lot cooler than I ever thought anime could be.  It led me to other things like ""Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne"", and I have been into anime ever since!

I'm surprised that the most critical reviews are from 'fanboys' who sound like my old girlfriend who dragged me to the f*****g Harry Potter movies, and then complained about things like, ""In the book the tree is over there, they put the tree in the wrong place!""  OMG, WHO CARES!

Anyway, please ignore the hyper-critical reviews, this series is so very cool.  If you have any interest in vampires (not the girly EMO kind) then you really need to check this out.  After this go to 'Hellsing Ultimate' and you will enjoy it that much more.  And for those who are new to Hellsing here is a tip:  The main character is named Alucard, which is Dracula backwards.  You might call this a 'reinvention' of Dracula, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Bram Stoker's character OR story.

In short, 5 starts, watch this.  Period.",1353024000,34,1201,4.530232558139535
5191230,5,B008YRL6WM,"He's killing the franchise.

What he doesn't realize is that by writing that review and scarring off potential customers; (Unnecessarily I might add.) he is effectively killing the franchise...potentially ruining the future experience for others and existing fans such as myself. As an anime man who LOVES, not just this show, but also this FRANCHISE, I can not sit by and let that happen. (I'm going to avoid an offtopic lecture in this review about how important it is to buy and support the anime franchises you love in any way possible; since the industry is so brittle at the moment EVERY show is at risk...) However, I apologize in advance that this may mean I'm slightly biased but, you know what, **** it Hellsing is amazing. Moving on.

For those curious... This is an older adaptation of a manga (Japanese comic) called Hellsing. They made this show WHILE the manga was still being released and eventually the release of the tv series passed the release of the manga series. As such, they had to improvise. This means roughly half of the series doesn't follow the original story as found in the original source material.

Hellsing:Ultimate fixes that problem. It is a more faithful, and more accurate, OAV series (Instead of TV Series...This gave them higher budgets per episode and no restrictions in the gore, ect.) that, while the TV Series is good, is widely considered and hailed as a dark masterpiece.

However, with that said, while the remake would be a perfect 5 stars this show IS STILL (Probably for most) a 3.5 star show, but it's different for everybody. I actually know a few people that enjoyed it MORE then the remake because of how dark Hellsing:Ultimate is. (Also because the two shows go in relatively different directions.) I PERSONALLY loved the original ideas behind Hellsing so much, and loved the show to such a great extent- that I actually was able to enjoy this show to a full five star rating.  It's different for everyone, but I do recommend you try the first three episodes out online.

I will (eventually) (re)write a very long, in depth review of Hellsing:Ultimate which I will edit in here for you guys to redirect to (if I finish it.) I actually already wrote and nearly finished one, but my computer crashed and I lost everything. As you could probably guess, since I lost hours and hours of work I'm sort of discouraged at the moment from writing another. You may be wondering why I didn't save it, and that's because I was working all night on it and had such fervor writing it that I, quite literally, forgot to. Least to say I will never make that mistake again. I will say, though, that I do plan on eventually getting back to it.

I really don't want to go into the characters and plot because this is such a short show (13 Episodes) that It'd be a better experience overall (In my opinion) if you go in not knowing much. All you really need to know is that this is about two vampires that work for a secret British agency which protects the population against the supernatural. (Even the concept is awesome? Makes you wonder... How was nobody able to think of this!?)

Well that sums up about everything I wanted to say. So cheers! Again, don't listen to that other review he literally couldn't be more misguided. (I'll try to avoid insults.) Try it for yourself. It may not be a five star show but it can and is able to stand on its own. A good point of reference for other anime fans would be to compare the Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood series. If you pointed a gun to my head and forced me to say a single negative thing about this series, I'd say I am disappointed that this series isn't in Blu Ray.

I wish you the best of luck and a good day.

Blitzkrieger Man

P.S. The only one that can benefit from liking (If you do, in fact, like them) both shows is you. Restricting yourself to one or the other is simply limiting yourself. (Again, that's IF you like them.) Go in with an open mind, it's the same voice actors for all the characters so transitioning between one and the other isn't nearly as difficult as many claim.",1351814400,77,4108,4.560379918588874
5191231,2,B008YRL6WM,"I amazed how many people like to view this series through the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia when in fact this show is not really that old (early 2000's) nor really that good. Let's just go down the list of story elements. Firstly, Is this plot entertaining? No, not really. It stretches out and alters the storyline from the first two volumes of the manga (and that was the bearable portion) and the second half is so inexplicably boring and confusing that I saw no point to any of it. Secondly, are the art style and animation any good? No, not really. There is a lot of unintentional failings in the animation that you begin to notice a lot after the second episode. Characters look like cardboard cutouts, women look like men (I'm so sorry, Integra), and character design elements keep moving around (look for moving scar character). Thirdly, is the action any good? NO! Some of the greatest fight scenes from the first two volumes of the manga are neutered and torn apart to where nothing truly badass can happen in any of these scenes (most likely a result of studio censorship and editing of some fairly graphic content). The only good elements of this show are the jazz score they use for background music and the well-animated opening, and the characters and dubbed voices. The first good thing is not really worth the price of purchase, and while the second positive is truly awesome, here is my rebuttal: these same characters and voices are used in the much better Hellsing Ultimate OVA series. Seriously, this series just feels like an attempt at a neutered, safe version of Kouta Hirano's bats&%t insane gore fest, and when you think about it that way, what's the point of buying this? Either you like this material or you don't. It's as simple as that; And if you like this material, then go watch the real deal. Leave this studio censored bullcrap alone. Go buy the Hellsing Ultimate OVA's. Those I can recommend wholeheartedly. As for this, unless you're just really curious or a real diehard has-to-see-everything Hellsing fan, just give it a pass. This version of Hellsing should have stayed in Geneon hell where it belongs.",1351123200,19,2146,4.7560321715817695

5191239,5,B008YRL6WM,"When I originally started this anime, I thought I wouldn't be able to get into it that quickly. I was proven wrong immediately when I couldn't stop watching the bloodbath in amazement until its conclusion. Hellsing is not for the weak stomached individual, but that makes it even better at doing what it needs to: quench your thirst for action, mayhem, drama, vampires, dark magic, technology, and two groovy themes that leave you dancing along to them. If you're wondering what they are, the ending theme is Shine by Mr. Big and the closing theme is The World Without Logos by Yasushi Ishii. If the intro and the outro can't convince you to watch, Anime America did a review of this series on YouTube and even compared it to Hellsing Ultimate to see which one is the better view.

5191255,5,B008YRL6WM,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Hellsing, but it was definitely awesome. Let me just state, this is definitely not for those who are sensitive to gore, cursing, and sexual themes.

Visually, Hellsing very much intrigued me. Some of the hire choices and background colours seemed very unique. A good example is the coloration in the first episode. The sky is red in several shots which definitely sets the vampire theme, but also provides the more lighthearted tones.

Hellsing seemed fairly lighthearted in general, for having such serious implications. I was amazed at how well the blended humor, violence, and dark themes. It's sickly satisfying.

The characters were very satisfying too. All of the characters were engrossing, they all had great dialogue, and they all provided a superb source of entertainment. This anime want afraid to show off the dark side characters either.

I'd say that the darkest aspect of this anime was it's plot. The crimes against humanity that vampires committed definitely showcased the importance of the Hellsing society. Without the Hellsing society, the world would've been easily thrown into chaos. I also found it to be great that the main organization fighting vampires had a couple of vampires in their employee; sometimes you must fight fire with fire.

Now, the soundtrack was definitely enjoyable. It was used very well to portray the feeling of many scenes. I also have to say that the opening theme was one of my favorite opening themes to date. It was just perfect for the anime.

This adult themed anime was a great sum of all of its individual parts. I got so engrossed in each episode, that I was surprised by when they ended. This classic definitely deserves a place in both your heart and your anime collection.",1481155200,7,1766,4.929292929292929

Voice acting is decent for an english  translation. Obviously the production was rushed both in Japan and America as the art work
and uncertainty of Hellsing's gender shows. Mr./Mrs. Hellsing is refered to Mr. But voiced by a woman. and only occasionally
refered to as a woman. Usually he/she, it is refered to as a man. Still, as quick little snippitts of horror goes. It's not bad.",1464566400,,498,4.790697674418604

I'm about done with the first disc and we will see on the second disc because it's more scratched.  I tried not to let this influence the rating due to the fact that it could be a fluke and every other shipment is intact as should be and hellsing has that anime classic feel to it but just fair warning",1462233600,2,716,4.226277372262774

Regardless, the dvd came with a cardboard protective sleeve over it which easily slid off, but I'll likely leave it on for display purposes. There are two discs, the first containing the initial 7 episodes with the second containing the remaining 6 along with various special features. The special features themselves are nothing to be too hyped about, but it was moderately pleasant to be able to see the textless openings. The special features also include a staff interview and some of the original trailers and commercials, though personally I wasn't too interested in either of those.

In any case, if you're a longtime lover of anime or someone just looking for a quick and brutal vampire fix, Hellsing will definitely satisfy.",1460332800,,1006,4.809248554913295

5191292,5,B008YRL6WM,"Hellsing classic, the first anime series that came out in 2001. Here is my review for it, please enjoy

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) In a little town called Cheddar (yes like the cheese and no im not kidding it really is called cheddar) is being over run with a vampire biting people and turning them into ghouls. The police are over run and being turned into ghouls. When sudden Sir Integra the leader of the Hellsing Organization comes and tells them to her her and her team handle the whole situation. Mean while at the church Seras Victoria a young police officer and two other cops enter they find the priest eating one of the other cops that was sopost to stop the vampire only to find out the priest is the vampire. When the priest orders his ghoul minions to shoot the cops only Seras survives. Meanwhile Sir Integra tells the cops to let Alucard (the vamprie featured on the cover art of the dvd case) take it from there. When Alucard gets to the church the priest orders his ghouls to kill him but finds it impossible to kill Alucard. When Alucard shoots down all the ghouls only leaving the priest and Seras alive. He asks Seras if he can take a shot to kill the priest, She agrees and Alucard shoots her threw the chest and kills the vampire priest. Not wanting to see her die, Alucard offers to make Seras a vampire and serve under him, She agrees and becomes the second vampire to join the Hellsing Organization. Now with Sir Integra Farebrook Wingates Hellsing the leader, Walter Dornez the butler, Seras Victoria the newbie, and Alucard the most badass vampire hunter ever, go on a mission to destroy all vampires and monsters that ravage the country of England once and for all. As their motto says ""In the name of god impure souls of the living dead shall be banished into eternal damnation, amen.""

Pros: The series has a good story line. The characters are nice and you feel like you can connect with them. There is action and there is blood spilt and seen in the show. The dubbing is good in my oppion because they all or most of the characters have english accents because the entire show takes place in very early 2000s england. This series is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you won't miss a thing

Disc pros: there are 13 episodes that come on 2 discs so you save alot of space.

Story Cons part 1: The story is incomplete because the whole story line is about (sorry minor spoilers) who is making synthetic vampire with a computer chip. They never find it out.

Story Cons part 2: The show comes with all 13 episodes but 5 of them are filler that doesn't even impact the story line at all.

Hellsing Classic vs Hellsing Ultimate: I'm going to do a review for Hellsing Ultimate but here is a quick sum up. Hellsing Ultimate is a lot closer to the manga than this. With Hellsing Classic it goes way off tract from what it really should be. As I said above with the story cons part 1 and 2, Hellsing Ultimate really fullfills the story line by making it complete and telling it out.

Over all thoughts: I thought this series was okay to say the least, if you never seen either Hellsing Classic or Ultimate, you will think this series is good but once you see Ultimate it blow Classic way out of the water!! Overall I would surgest buying this series if you want to have a foot hold into the hellsing series, this is like a starter version before the real action starts.",1452816000,,3398,4.4185303514377
5191293,5,B008YRL6WM,"This is, by far, one of my favorite animes (if not THE favorite) right up there with Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Genocyber and Attack on Titan.

This is the ""Classic"" version meaning it was made before the mangas were even finished.  To get the full Hellsing experience, I highly recommend watching both THIS series AND the Hellsing Ultimate series.

This version is grittier and gives you that old school anime feel.  There are parts that are jaw-droppingly wicked.  It has scenes in it that Ultimate does not, like the SUPER graphic and extremely MATURE/ADULT EYES ONLY way Alucard meets his master, Integra.  The MUSICAL SCORE in this one is also far better than the one in Ultimate.  It is unique, full of Swag, Swing and Silent Hill.  Creepy undertones and rifts right in the middle of a bluesy swag, with random cult classic Godzilla sounds thrown in.  Its epic.  I recommend buying the OST (original sound track) RAID.

Half way through, the plot deviates and follows a new story that is not in the manga.  Even though it differs from the manga at that point, it WORKS, because the characters stay true to themselves.  If you're like me and need things to make some kind of chronological sense, you can just say that the SECOND half of this classic version happened BEFORE the SECOND half of the Ultimate version.  It works nicely like that.  The classic version is like getting an extra story about one of the many conflicts the Hellsing Organization conquers before the events of Hellsing Ultimate take place.  AND, it goes more in depth on certain subjects and backstories that Ultimate skimmed out on.  Ultimate, however, went more in depth on certain areas that this one didn't....  so really, both are necessary to get a full picture of the Hellsing world.

I highly recommend it!  Also - as a note -  SPOILER ALERT.....Alucard IS Dracula..who IS Vlad the Impaler.  Kouta Hirano stated so in several interviews.  So this story picks up and continues Bram Stoker's novel.  The all encompassing Dracula story is better portrayed in Hellsing Ultimate, but this series does still allude to who Alucard.",1452384000,4,2112,4.818941504178273

5191370,4,B008YRL6WM,"For those of us who are familiar with the various incarnations of ""Hellsing"" (this, the OVA, the manga, etc), this may seem too tame to really fit with the franchise. However, if you're new to the material, this is actually a really good starting point. It is milder than the OVA, true, but for someone just getting started into the series, it's perfect. It's also a good purchase for those of us who remember seeing it back in the early 2000s when the series first hit the US with these episodes.
The product is well packaged and contains all 13 episodes from the Funimation release. And honestly, for a ""classic"" anime, $18 isn't too much to ask. It's worth it to get into the series for the first time, with little commitment if you're not happy with what you see. The OVA standard price is over $50, which is a little steep if you're not sure you'll like it.
As for the actual content, I'm sure you could probably find much better descriptions of the series and the individual episodes than I could possibly give you here. This particular part of the franchise WAS designed to be an introduction into the mythos that is Hellsing. It is not designed to be a compendium, it is not designed to be the complete story, and it's true what others have said, it diverges from the ""true"" story quite a bit. But it's still a good anime, and still worth what Amazon has listed for the price.",1361145600,7,1384,4.452755905511811
5191371,4,B008YRL6WM,"Well, I have read most popular bad reviews and good reviews.
If you are a Hellsing fan, you have to at least buy it out of sheer curiosity. Here's some points of my own:

1. Pay attention to the year it was made. The 2000's were the years of ""lazy anime"", especially when it came to TV series. Because it was TV series, it had to be quick, cheap and easy. And there goes the quality of drawing.

2. Pay attention to the year it was made. The manga wasn't even half the way finished yet at that time. That means two things. First of all, the creators had to improvise with the plot. Secondly, the creators had to improvise with the drawing of that plot.
Now, as far as the plot goes, I was really confused with the most popular positive review here, which said that roughly 50% of the show doesn't follow the manga. Well, it's actually more than that, in my opinion. I thought that what the person meant to say was that the show follows the manga until the point where there was no more manga to base the show on. That is NOT the case. Don't be confused like I was. The show has completely different plot but uses bits and pieces of the manga, including the dialogues. Two examples of this could be Jan and Luke's attack on the mansion. The manga has it, of course, but in the there, Luke and Jan acted on directions from Millennium, and the ghouls had been prepared for them. In the show, they launched an attack because the decided to do that, and they had to prepare the ghouls themselves. That completely eliminates Millennium from the plot. The other example could be Alucard saying to Anderson, ""So, what does it make you? A man, a dog, a monster?"" - basically the same thing that he said to the SWAT officer in the manga (and OVA 3). There are actually many bits and pieces like that, and if you have previously watched the OVA, about 4-5 times, like I did, you will be able to pick them all up pretty easily. However, the plot of the series itself gives a bit more dues to Seras Victoria. She plays a more active role, you get to see her more often, and she does investigate matters on her own. The plot is different, but that doesn't mean that it is automatically worse.
Then, as far improvising with the drawing of the plot, that's where the quality issue comes back yet again. It was a TV series already, so here goes the quality, BUT then they decided to improvise with the characters that they already had right from the start - the quality suffered yet again. The OVA is basically animated page-by-page, following the manga (with exception of several things like pages where Seras trained with the wild Geese - they are animated as part of the ending credits, because otherwise they would require too much ""in-between"" animation). In order to make the story flow, instead of it being a series of animated pages, there is something called ""in-between"" animation. In the OVA, the most noticeable piece of ""in-between"" animation is where Seras dreams of zombies/ghouls running after her, and then she wakes up in the bed after having been turned into a vampire. She doesn't really look like herself, nor does Alucard... And the way they drew Integra at that point makes her nose look huge. That kind of stuff happens when animators have to draw ""in-between"" actions with the characters, and it isn't present in the manga. The artists don't really have the feel for the characters because they haven't created them. So they draw whatever they feel is right. It is just fanart at that point. And the TV series, to put it simply, IS mostly ""in-between"" animation. The characters look themselves when they are based on actual manga pages. All other times it is pretty much guessing work of the artists as to how the characters would look like in that situation. So, we have the fact that it is a TV series, and the fact that the animators had to draw the characters themselves for the most part. You could bet anything that that should have an effect on overall quality. With that being said, some characters in the TV series, like Anderson, for example, are animated more closely to the manga than in OVA. In OVA, Anderson is chubby, and his face is more round, whereas in TV series he is leaner with a longer face, just like in the manga.

So, with all that being said, yes, the story isn't that exciting, yes, the quality reminds you of 2000's, but if you are a Hellsing fan, you have to get it. To me, it is an occasional watch. I watched it in one sitting, and I might do it again within a few months, as opposed to the OVA, which I can watch any given day. But come on, if you call yourself a Hellsing fan, support the franchise, buy the TV series and watch it. It has its charm - all I can say about it. AND if you haven't watched the OVA yet - don't reverse the order. Watch the TV series first, and then the OVA. Then you would be able to appreciate the TV series more, because you won't be expecting as much. It is all based on your expectations, remember.

Finally, I would like to say thanks to those who submitted positive reviews, because they ultimately helped me to make a decision about buying the TV series AFTER I have already familiarized myself with manga and OVA.

Overall - buy it. Especially now, when the price has dropped. Looks good on the shelf, makes you look a loyal Hellsing fan, and makes a good occasional watch when you feel nostalgic about the 'old anime' days. The characters are the same, even though they do different things and have been animated differently, but what the hell. He is still Alucard, he is still Walter, she is still Seras, and she is still Integra. One way or the other - it is the characters that you like the most in any manga. If you didn't like the characters - you wouldn't read the manga, and you wouldn't care about the plot, right? So, give yourself a little treat. And then go to the OVA and give yourself a much bigger treat.",1360454400,2,5897,4.406422018348624
5191372,5,B008YRL6WM,"There seems to be a bit of fuss over the DVD release of Hellsing (Classic). At least more than there should be anyways. Obviously those that have seen the newer ""Hellsing: Ultimate"" series have for the most part said they found it to be outstanding. To be quite honest I haven't watched the original series in many years. After finally picking up both of the Blu Ray releases of Ultimate I noticed that they had re-released the classic series as well.
First off, the plot in the beginning is relatively similar to Ultimate's. While Ultimate sticks closer to the original manga the classic series begins to deviate and do its own thing shortly before the halfway point. This is where a lot of people began to take issue as they felt the plot just didn't hold up too well in the long run. That of course is subjective, as is the animation style which is a lot less stylish and 'modern.' It looks more like the Gundam Wing series. But what can you do? It's an older show. It really is worth at least a watch. At the current price ($20 or so) it's a steal. 300 minutes of blood drenched action and if nothing else it provides insight into an alternate take on the Hellsing universe. The final verdict? Hellsing Ultimate is far superior indeed, in fact if you haven't seen it I strongly recommend you pick up Volumes I-IV and V-VIII first and then go back and watch the classic series. The two series don't go hand-in-hand plot wise so you can technically watch them in whatever order you prefer. In my honest opinion you should pick up this set as well as the first 8 volumes of Ultimate. Hellsing is hands down one of the best things to happen to the animation world.",1360195200,,1664,4.4411764705882355

The packaging is neat and crisp, though you miss some of the special features and artwork that came with the original pioneer release, but seeing as how that release is out of print this is a damn good re release, the audio and video are crisp and clean, the packaging is secure and the set itself makes a handsome addition to anyone's collection.",1358985600,,467,4.367816091954023

8532644,5,B008YRL6WM,"Hellsing is absolutely amazing!!!! I have the Series and thought I would purchase the television series. Now, I have a better understanding of the characters and their stories. I was not thrilled with Integra's attitude towards Alucard at first. Come on! Alucard is nobility just like Integra and should at least be respected. However, the show where Alucard supports Integra during her moment of crisis shows the depth of their relationship. I loved the line Alucard says to Integra while she is in the operating cube ""You will always be that same little girl to me."" The ending of the television series seems incomplete. In one of the shows Alucard asks if Integra wants to drink his blood or if he could drink her blood. The ending leaves Alucard's  question and Integra's answer up in the air. It would be nice to have some closure both in the television and OVA series.",1529280000,,874,4.75

8532651,5,B008YRL6WM,"Otaku John here, the super-fan of Anime, Light Novels, and Manga, here to review a great anime series ""Hellsing"" (Classic).  First, I'm not going to get into the whole online debate between the Classic vs. the Manga vs. the Ultimate.  Each is great and each has its own niche.  For a true super fan of anime, and Hellsing, it's suffice to say that all are worth owning and let's just talk about the Classic Series here and now. With that being said, this is a must-have for any anime fan who loves action and horror.  Worth every penny of the price and makes you want to keep on watching over and over.  Some people complain about the animation, but I think this animation is great, colorful, and smooth. (and in my opinion is actually better than the Ultimate animation)...
  In any case, the story is quick-paced, and keeps you wanting more.  If you've never seen any of the Hellsing animes, or have only seen Ultimate, definitely give this one a try.  To me, it's the best because of the nostalgic classic experience of it all. It's like the James Bond franchise.  Sure, more modern James Bond films may have more spectacular special effects and stunts, but nothing can beat the original Sean Connery.  It's the same with Hellsing.  You just can beat the ""Classic"" series.  I've shown this to non-fans of anime, who thought all anime was for kids like pokemon and dragonball z.  Then they see this and are like ""Wow!  Where's this been my whole life?"" and they convert to anime fans.
  The trouble with Hellsing is that it's been re-done so many times with the original manga, then the Classic series, then the rare ""Fleaks"" edition, then the Ultimate, that hardcore Hellsing fans waste too much time comparing and bickering about them all.  I think it's high time all Hellsing fans come together and appreciate them all, and especially appreciate this Classic set as being the first anime to introduce the world of Hellsing to mainstream audiences.  After all, this isn't rocket-science.  It's anime.  It's meant to be enjoyed as entertainment, pure escapism, and fun-filled viewing.  With that being said, be forewarned, this is for mature audiences only, is very bloody and has adult themes.  (That's what makes it so dang good!)  If you've never seen Hellsing at all, buy this.  You won't be disappointed.  If you've only seen Ultimate, buy this.  You won't be disappointed.  If you like action and vampires, buy this.  You won't be disappointed.  Besides this Hellsing Classic, and Hellsing Ultimate, I also highly recommend: Devil May Cry: The Complete Series S.A.V.E., Drifters anime (also by same author as Hellsing), Shiki anime, and Tokyo Ghoul.",1515888000,,2658,4.816371681415929
