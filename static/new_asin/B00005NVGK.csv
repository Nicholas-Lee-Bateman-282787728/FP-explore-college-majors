7947855,2,B00005NVGK,"Richard Norton has never had a great solo feature. Thats a subjective statement, but I think its fair, given that nobody seems to mention his starring vehicles among the great moments of his career. The Sword of Bushido had potential to be one of those moments, but loses it thanks to some stupid writing and a shortage of martial arts action. It may belong on the wish lists of collectors, but I don't know who else would be interested.

The story: An ex-Navy SEAL (Norton) searching for his grandfathers remains in Thailand is caught up in a fight for a historical Japanese sword stolen decades ago.

A film production can do a lot worse than director Adrian Carr (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danielle-Steel-s-Now-Forever/dp/B00009MEGN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danielle Steel's Now & Forever</a>), who has an eye for cinematography and does a lot with this ones rural and jungle settings. Leading man Norton is in great shape and looks every bit the star that Van Damme ever did, but disappointingly, his character is far from endearing. The movies writer was on a machismo kick and crafted a story so blatantly worshipful of the white male hero that its embarrassing. This is best illustrated thru the presentation of his costar Rochelle Ashana (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer/dp/0783114885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer</a>), who enters her role as an action star but devolves into a helpless love interest over the course of various tragedies. Nortons character comes across as lecherous and opportunistic in his romantic pursuits, and theres a tasteless moment wherein the script jokes about sexual harassment when thats exactly what its star is doing. Ugh.

The action content doesnt make up for much of this. Richards one of those folks who must actively try before they make a bad fight scenes, but the four ones here merely hover around the average rank. The best of these is a decent swordfight with Toshihiro Obata (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showdown-in-Little-Tokyo/dp/6305161992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showdown in Little Tokyo</a>), who shows up in the films second half to grab the vacant role of the main villain. The rest of the adrenaline scenes  mainly shootouts  are likewise nothing special, but we get a little boost in the form of an absurd chase scene wherein Richard tails a car in a go-cart.

For my money, the best Richard Norton vehicle available now is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Gun/dp/B0000A02VX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Gun</a>&nbsp;from 1995  by when Richards filmmakers had refined his style of fight scene and developed a better idea of what makes a strong character. A fan could do a lot worse than The Sword of Bushido, but also much better. Leave this one til you're really hurting for karate flicks.",1459900800,,2956,5.812933025404157
7947856,4,B00005NVGK,"Somehow, Richard Norton is still virtually unknown in America as an action movie hero. Tall, always buff, blonde and handsome, with good acting skills and super fast hands, Norton has carried several Roger Corman low budget productions that would be unwatchable except for his presence. His ability to deliver a line convincingly, and physically destroy his opponents keep me watching his movies. Sword of Bushido is an 80's action/drama where Norton tracks down his father's WW2 crash site near Thailand. Elsewhere on the island, he finds another item, a priceless samurai sword that he must fight with Japanese mafia to keep. The Decent gun battles, several karate showdowns, and a surprising lack of 80's goofiness makes this flick more watchable. Region 2 dvd is fullscreen and not as bright as it should be, but decent un-remastered picture quality.",1362441600,,854,5.195652173913044
