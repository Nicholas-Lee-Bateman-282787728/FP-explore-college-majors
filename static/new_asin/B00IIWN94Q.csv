8642451,4,B00IIWN94Q,Lots of Great information for us beautiful barefoot horse lovers.,1490140800,,65,5.6
8642452,5,B00IIWN94Q,"Great information. I've had horses for 40 years, did many of my own trims.  Pictures were okay, could have been better. Really liked the format and instruction. Even though I'm not planning to trim my own horse now, it has helped me to diagnose problems and be more informed when my trimmer comes out. I might even give it a try myself sometime.",1430697600,,345,4.476190476190476
8642453,3,B00IIWN94Q,"The content about this method is FANTASTIC.  The video was rather poorly done.  The sound wasn't working very well and I was required to read most of the information. I did like the slow mode that they used for some of the techniques.  I would recommend her books HIGHLY but the Video was just ok, because the quality was so bad that it was distracting.  The Hoof Guided Method, is EXCELLENT, and I did pick up enough info to make it worth watching, but I prefer to use Pete Ramey's videos in my reference, library because the quality of his videos are so much better.",1415059200,2,568,4.380952380952381
8642454,5,B00IIWN94Q,I am using Maureen's method now and find it much easier.,1414800000,,56,4.181818181818182
8642455,4,B00IIWN94Q,"I really appreciate the HGM video, as it has allowed me to understand how to trim my own horses, one of which has founder. I haven't had a good trimmer in a long time, and I was sick of looking! The only criticism I have of this video is that some of the first parts showing the actual trimming process aren't completely in the shot. And I only wish there were more on problem feet such as founder. Although there are founder cases on the website, trying to figure out exactly how to trim my horse has been a struggle. He is doing MUCH better since I started this method tho, so I will continue to use it on any horse I have! Maybe a second video is in order? Problem feet? ;)
Thanks for putting great information out !",1398902400,3,719,4.142857142857143
8642456,5,B00IIWN94Q,"If you've gotten thoroughly confused over what constitutes a ""barefoot trim,"" come home to this DVD and its companion book.  Maureen's Hoof Guided Method is direct, no-nonsense, uncomplicated, non-intimidating, and it works.  I've been using her method for several months and this DVD (along with my horses' improving hoof health) gave me confidence that I am on the right track.  Some barefoot trimming information out there is thoroughly intimidating, some of it is downright outrageous.  This DVD will guide you safely through trimming your own horse.  You can do no harm by following Maureen's instructions. I suggest buying the book as well (""Natural Trimming, the Hoof Guided Method) for more in-depth coverage of some aspects of the hoof, as well as educating oneself about the health advantages of ""going barefoot"" in general.",1395878400,,834,5.287878787878788
