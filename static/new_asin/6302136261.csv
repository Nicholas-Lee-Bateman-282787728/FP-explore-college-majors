427278,4,6302136261,"Fred Astaire made over thirty musicals, beginning with a brief role in DANCING LADY and ending in FINIAN'S RAINBOW, and this one is far from his best, but it does contain many marvelous moments. Once you get past the fact that Fred was over thirty years older than Leslie Caron, there is everything to enjoy about the film. Unfortunately, the film contains one of the weaker scores in any Fred Astaire film, with one glorious exception. By any standard, Johnny Mercer's ""Something's Gotta Give"" is one of the great songs in any Astaire film. Although Fred was never a great singer, he was unparalleled in his ability to present a song onscreen. There is something exquisite in the way he gestures as he sings about an irresistible force like her meeting an old immovable object like him. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are not up to that standard.
Leslie Caron is, to me, one of the most extraordinarily attractive women in the history of film. I think I would enjoy a film in which she did nothing but sit in a chair. Fortunately, in this film she does a great deal more than sit in a chair. Although trained as a ballerina, Caron possessed a gaminlike style of dancing that I find enormously appealing.
This film was made near the end of Astaire's career in romantic musical comedy. He was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the age differences between him and his leading ladies. He made his next two and final musicals, FUNNY FACE and SILK STOCKINGS, only with great reluctance. Rather than ignore the great age difference in this film between the two leads, it becomes a part of the plot.
Again, this is not one of Astaire's greatest films. It is not in the same category as his work with Ginger or Rita Hayworth, or such films as THE BAND WAGON or EASTER PARADE. But it is still a thoroughly enjoyable film, and one that any fan of musicals or Fred Astaire or Leslie Caron can watch with enormous enjoyment.",1040947200,13,1925,4.631578947368421
427279,4,6302136261,"Fred Astaire has never been a dirty old man-- at least not on screen!! Though he was indeed 56 years old here and Caron was 22 years old (and playing 18), the film's approach to this rather sticky material is completely chaste and innocent. That's why it soars so beautifully. The initial courtship is anonymous. Things only get sticky in the ensuing months as true love intercepts. But it is a prudish visiting ambassador, not Astaire himself, who makes a tacky ""sugar daddy"" reference, forcing Astaire to go 'noble' and disappear (temporarily) from Caron's life as his own conscience starts bothering him. Ironically, this is really the only dull moment of the film for me- the extended dream ballet of Caron imagining the elusive Astaire all around the world. But the story itself- aided by some lovely musical sequences (""Welcome Egghead,"" ""C-A-T,"" ""Dream,"" and especially ""Something's Gotta Give"")- is charming, safe viewing for the entire family. The ending is especially fine, because *two* love stories have resolved instead of just one. And how cool is it to dance with someone on your roof terrace, step into your hat, spin into your wrap, and dance out the front door?!!",1018310400,6,1181,4.96969696969697
427280,3,6302136261,"You know, when I was a kid and first saw this on ""Movie in the Morning"", I just didn't like it; don't know why, just didn't. Well, the other night, I rented it. Hadn't seen it in over 25 years, still don't like it, but now I have a better understanding of why.
Most of the plot of ""Daddy Long Legs"" hinges on Fred's being considerably older than Leslie Caron. That doesn't have to be bad, in and of itself. But there's a leering quality to the film--there are all these references to sugar daddies and implied jailbait remarks. Fred's character is a millionaire who somewhat impulsively sponsors a young French orphan at an American college anonymously, and then completely forgets about having done it for a few years. The orphan faithfully writes her unknown benefactor a letter every month, calling him Daddy Long Legs. Well, eventually Fred is made to remember about the orphan and seeks her out at a college dance. But when he talks to her in the garden, he really sounds like he's checking her out. I never thought Fred Astaire could be creepy, but he's border line here. Anyway, the underage stuff is far-fetched because while Leslie Caron is far from middle-aged herself, she ain't no eighteen either.
Granted, the two move gracefully together, and she has some marvelous clothes. I'm always amazed to see Fred dance especially in these later movies; here in 1955, he was 56. That's the same age as Bogart, a year older than Tracy, two years older than Gable that year, but there's no comparison with what he could do physically and what those men were like at the same exact moment in time.
So, final verdict is that it is too long and for the first time I was uncomfortable at a Fred Astaire movie.",1007078400,10,1708,4.584967320261438
427281,5,6302136261,"I realize that many Fred Astaire fans may not agree that DADDY LONG LEGS is his best film made without Ginger Rogers. But I stand by that opinion. The film is a delight, lavishly produced, with an excellent script and cast, and some outstanding musical sequences.
DADDY LONG LEGS is the story of third-generation multi-millionaire Jervis Pendleton (Astaire) who, while on a good-will ambassadorial trip to France, observes and is charmed by young Julie Andre (Leslie Caron), who lost her parents during World War II and has been raised in a countryside orphanage. Jervis lavishes material support on Julie, bringing her to the U.S. and sending her to a women's college. Yet he doesn't reveal himself to Julie, who knows her benefactor only as ""Daddy Long Legs."" Then the two meet at a college dance, and romance--and complications--follow.
DADDY LONG LEGS was Astaire's only film for 20th Century-Fox, and the studio gave him a superb supporting cast, including Terry Moore, Fred Clark, and the peerless Thelma Ritter. The film's script is by Henry and Phoebe Ephron, parents of today's famous writer/director Nora Ephron (SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, YOU'VE GOT MAIL). The script is witty and tender and features two wonderfully developed central characters, who are brought to life beautifully by Astaire and Caron. This was (sadly) the last musical in which Caron showed her dancing talents, but she also shows here the abundant acting talent that has sustained her career to the present day. And Astaire, too, displays the outstanding acting abilities that were unfortunately always overshadowed by his status as the screen's leading male dancer.
Good as the rest of the movie is, it's the musical portions that really lift DADDY LONG LEGS to the heights. First, there are two lavish ballet sequences choreographed by Caron's dance mentor, Roland Petit. The second features a distraught Caron searching for Astaire in settings representing Paris, Hong Kong and Rio. Caron's abilities are on excllent display here (although I leave to dance critics the question of the sequence's actual artistic merit). The other dance sequence is an amusing and colorful daydream showing Caron's musings about who her benefactor might be: a Texas millionaire, an international playboy, or her guardian angel. The ""angel"" segment is particularly outstanding, featuring excellent dancing, a lavish setting, and the bravura orchestral accompaniment of Alfred Newman and the 20th Century-Fox orchestra.
Even more satisfying than the ballets, though, are Astaire and Caron's ""popular"" dance duets, the romantic ""Something's Gotta Give"" and the college dance ensemble, ""The Sluefoot."" The two dancers make a marvelous pair, and their work together conveys much of the same exhiliration and joy that Astaire helped create during those legendary 1930s dances with Rogers. And adding to the magic of both numbers are Johnny Mercer's excellent songs--""Something's Gotta Give"" has, of course, become a ""standard,"" while ""The Sluefoot"" features an amusing lyric full of Mercer's distinctive vernacular wordplay. In addition, the film also makes excellent use of Mercer's beautiful ballad ""Dream,"" which had actually been written as a pop tune ten years earlier.
As other reviewers have noted, DADDY LONG LEGS has a long running time, over two hours. But I enjoy every magical moment of a film that is certainly one of Astaire's best.",981936000,107,3402,5.313543599257885

427480,4,6302136261,"This Blu-ray edition of Daddy Long Legs is an improvement over the standard issue DVD, but not really that much. And consider this. The disc deletes all of the 29 chapters that were on the DVD, which brought viewers directly to musical numbers. The Blu-ray provides 9 chapters, none of them keyed to a song, but to a dialogue scene nowhere connected to a song. You've got to search on your own. Very clumsy. Also, the DVD came in a slip cover, with a multi-page pamphlet. Like all Blu-ray discs, this edition has neither. Pay more for a Blu-ray, get less.

427550,2,6302136261,"This Blu-ray of ""Daddy Long Legs"" was a major disappointment.  I am hard of hearing and rely on closed caption.  Since Blu-ray is a relatively new update technique I expected this newer version would have closed caption --- but it did not.  Apparently the company that did the Blu-ray update decided to ""go cheap"" and leave off Closed Caption.  Not having closed caption (nor being warned in the write-up it didn't have closed caption) was a major disappointment.  I will certainly watch on any future  DVD purchase to ensure that doesn't come from that company.",1482451200,2,562,4.863157894736842
427551,5,6302136261,"I loved the book ever since I read it in high school. It was a book I read and reread. When I found out there was a movie, I wanted to see it but wasn't willing to pay twenty dollars for a DVD. I finally sat down and watched the tape and was not disappointed. It's loosely based on the book but that didn't stop it from being good to me. Judy is an orphan who grew up in a French orphanage. Jervis is a wealthy American who wants to give the bright, energetic girl a chance in life. He doesn't tell her who he is but pays for her schooling, gives her a beautiful wardrobe and only asks she write him letters. He doesn't at first but when his secretary gets on his case, he does. And this spoiled playboy does more than that. It's a great movie with great musical numbers. No, it's not the book but it's still great",1479859200,,814,4.030864197530864

427557,5,6302136261,"Watching this outstanding film on a 14 foot 2.40 aspect ratio screen on Blu-ray transported us with dance, music and talent to another era of Hollywood musicals.  Others have provided excellent reviews on content, but allow me to provide a few observations on the technical quality.  First, it appears that the film was not scanned from studio master negatives, due to some image softness and obvious 2nd or 3rd generation scene dissolves (cross fades) and dissolves from and to black.  Some of the scenes exhibit grain and lack of detail, but nothing really objectionable.  In general, the visual dynamic range is not what it could have been with some muted whites and grayish blacks, but still certainly very good.  The film's aspect ratio is exactly 2.37, not the 1.85:1 as noted on the back cover.  The audio dialog lacked the crispness and presence of almost all modern films and even some classic films of that time, but was certainly acceptable.  Video compression uses the H.264 codec and the feature offers a DTS-HD 2 channel soundtrack.  With that said, I loved it.",1473465600,2,1075,4.900552486187845
427558,5,6302136261,"This Blue Ray of Daddy Long Legs is a good transfer and is much easier on the eyes than the original DVD version, which I have too.  Sound Track is comparable to the optical tracks most movies had in the 1950's.  This edition has not lost any of its charm.

The one surprise I had was when I received the Disc, it stated on the back that the movie length was 91 minutes long and appears to be dated as of 1972.  I know the original movie was a feature movie of just over 2 hours in length and made in 1955.  I was going to leave it unopened and return it to Amazon.  But Amazon has been so good in the past with return items that were either defective or misrepresented, I decided to open it and play it and see what the story was on the misinformation. This movie is a carbon copy of the DVD and that one was a total representation of the original theater run of the movie.  So as Crocodile Dundee would say ""No Worries"" when it comes to having the right product and it will meet all previous expectations of the theater run and DVD release.
Enjoy!!!!!",1473120000,2,1053,4.132352941176471

427630,4,6302136261,"This is a film I enjoyed very much for the musical scenes, its great sense of humor, and Fred Astaire. In the movie, Jarvis Pendleton 3rd visits France on a diplomatic mission, passes by an orphanage, and spots a young, intelligent, 18-year-old girl who teaches French orphans English. Feeling attracted by this young woman, he decides to take her to America where she can study and get in a career since talent like hers cannot be waisted in a place like that. Jarvis sends Julie Andre to the States without letting her know who is the benefactor. Jarvis gets the name of Daddy Long Legs because the children spot him at night visiting the orphanage and only get to see his shadow. While Julie Andre is studying in the States, she feels she must write to her benefactor and decides to use the name of Daddy Long Legs to address him. Later on Julie will meet her benefactor without knowing who he is and they fall in love in spite of their differences in age.

Fred Astaire dances with Leslie Caron on 4 occasions, and this is a film where the audience won't see Astaire dance after about an hour in the film. In spite of this, the film flows easily without boring me at all. Its humor and plot elements keep the story alive. I think this is the only Astaire movie where this happens. My favorite dance here is the Sluefoot dance which Astaire and Caron dance along with a dance ensemble. This dance shows that Astaire is in great shape even with his fifty-plus years. As in the Ginger Roger films, dance is an important motif for love and romance. Lyrics and music are done by Johnny Mercer. Although it does have a long ""dream"" sequence which seems to ineffectively imitate The Red Shoes ballet in the movie with that name in 1948, the rest of the movie is really good, and I dare say that this is one of Fred Astaire best movies in his career.",1463702400,2,1846,4.429411764705883

The film is chock full of wonderful fantasy dance sequences and ballets.  The Technicolor is sumptuous.  The fashions are stunning.  Even in his 50s Fred Astaire is still fantastic and totally comfortable with new dancing styles.  Leslie Caron is one of his best partners ever, far more convincing and real and versatile than, for example, Cyd Charisse or Eleanor Powell.  Yes, she's too young for him...but then so was Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face!  After all, these are fantasies!  I try not to watch this movie too often, as it sends me into a reverie of my childhood in the 50s.  Enjoy.",1462320000,3,712,4.762295081967213

428418,5,6302136261,"This is a good movie.  It may be a little long, thanks to an extensive ballet sequence with the lovely Leslie Caron, but it really is Fred Astaire's film.  He shows his acting ability in light comedy here as he did six years later in ""The Pleasure of His Company"".  In my book he's incomparable.  Whether he's singing ""Somethin's Gotta Give"" to Ms. Caron, playing his beloved drums or dancing to ""Dream"" at the conclusion of the film, he shows what a true cinematic treasure he was.  Thelma Ritter and Fred Clark are more than worthy support.  Heavyweight, no.  Fluffy, kind of.  Worth seeing? Yes.  They don't make them like this anymore.

428425,4,6302136261,"I've always enjoyed this story, mostly because it's got Fred Astaire in it and I love his understated acting ability.  The storyline is also appealing, of course, as you watch an orphan grow into an independent woman.  And, instead of falling in love for all of the wrong reasons, she falls in love first, then finds out what she has done.  lol...don't worry, there's a (delightfully) happy ending.
I especially enjoyed watching it with the commentary, which is done partly by Mr. Astaire's daughter.  Unlike so many commentaries, which are so much uninteresting drivel, this one gives me an insight into Mr. Astaire's mindset at the time that the movie was filmed.  It gives background, reveals a lot about Mr. Astaire (I mentioned I'm a fan of his, right?), and how much of an influence he had on the shaping of the entire movie, from music to casting!  I have to admit, the commentary also made me more annoyed than ever by the ""ballet"" (as they are called) sequences because of what was edited out so that the sequences could be put in.  Shrug.  I'd love to see the studio put the song pieces back in and remove 7/8's of the dream/ballet sequence, which I don't feel conveys what they intended.",1383955200,2,1198,4.644549763033176

428467,5,6302136261,"Beautiful!  One element I really like about this movie and all movies from the 1940's and 1950's is the use of dance.  I have found it truly inspirational and joyous to watch musicals of this time period.  The dancing makes these films seem heightened,  more than full of life, ""Hyper-Real"".  This film is no exception.  The dancing by Fred AstaireMAGNIFICENT!  The gorgeous Leslie CaronBEAUTIFUL!  The directionVERY NICE, FLUID CAMERA MOVEMENTS!  The musical numbers and choreographyARTFUL, LIVELY,  HAPPY!  Fred's Drum routine...FUN!  The Roland Petit ballet sequences...ART HOUSE, BEAUTIFUL, SURREAL, AVANT-GARDE, ADVENTUROUS.  As an author, designer, and illustrator, I find inspiration from many elements.  Two of those elements are musicals from the 1940's and 1950's, like this one, and jazz, swing, and big band music of the same time period.  There are inspirational gems in the films and in the music that I fill my mind with and draw from when creating.  It's more about what I'm ""SEEING"" as a designer/creator than what I'm seeing or hearing regarding the actual movie or music.  If you would like to see the creative result of being inspired, energized, enkindled, quickened by musicals of the 1940's and 1950's, as well as jazz, swing, and big band music of the same time period, then view the illustrations and design in my Art & Design/How-To book, ""Cartoon Design Revealed"", by visiting this Amazon.com page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Design-Revealed-Kristian-Andrew-Sather/dp/1478710217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Design Revealed Kristian Andrew Sather</a>&nbsp;One never knows where inspiration will come from, when a joyous event will enter ones life, however, when the images and sounds from this musical were seen and heard I was inspired, I was full of joy.

428474,5,6302136261,"I have loved this movie since I ran across it when I was 14 years old and watching an old black and white
TV.
Musicals have always been my favorites but this one has all the elements I like in a musical:
lively singing and dancing from Fred Astaire; some ballet from Leslie Caron and two of the best character
actors in cinema: Fred Clark and Thelma Ritter.  The fantasy dances are the best EVER.
I don't even mind that it's a May/December romance between a 50s Fred Astaire and a 20s Leslie Caron.

The costumes for the dream sequences are delightful and it's fun seeing the ""latest"" fashions of the 50s.
If I could come back for one day as anyone who has ever lived, I'd like to come back as Leslie Caron
during the filming of the ""Something's Gotta Give"" sequence in the movie.  What a joy!  It is without a doubt one
of the most romantic sequences in any movie I've ever seen.  And they don't even kiss!

428475,3,6302136261,"Fred Astaire was Fred Astaire.  Top hat and white tails.  Cocktails at 5:00 and dinner after the show.  Every suit pressed to the nines and every woman, (Ginger Rogers) dressed to the hilt.  That was Fred Astaire.  Elegant and asexual.  Since he had a thinning hair line and was slim, he didn't age.  He was really the cat's ass at RKO.

Then.

But after RKO there was ""Broadway Melody of 1940"" and ""Holiday Inn"" and a couple of pictures with the gorgeous Rita Hayworth.  Slim and radiating as much sex appeal as a garden hose.

And in 1948 he made ""Easter Parade"" with Judy Garland and all hell broke loose.  It was a smash hit.  One of the biggest film hits of his - and her - careers.  After ""Easter Parade"" Garland went her way and Fred stayed in the tuxedo.

He also stayed in the role of older man teaches younger woman class blah blah blah and good god will he ever get out of a tuxedo?  ""Daddy Long Legs"" is ""Easter Parade"" with Leslie Caron.  And at this stage of the game, his kneecaps are beginning to rust.

Wonderful score but the score has been sung and performed by much finer people, so the score is meaningless in this film.  You don't really consider it at all in the grand scheme of things.  And there's really not much ""grand"" here.

Caron has her eye on the paycheck, though she's delightful enough.  Astaire,thinning hair and as asexual as always, once the cat's ass, is now the cat's dinner.",1369958400,,1414,4.378378378378378

428562,4,6302136261,"Daddy Long Legs(released May/55) is a smart film that turns what could have had a very lecherous overtone of a plot into a winner in the home stretch. Astaire's 24 year old co-star,Leslie Caron, stars in her eighth American film and contributes more to the acting sequences than the dancing ones.
The story involves a rich American industrialist by the name of Jervis Pendleton III(Astaire).He is a rather distracted person with his love of dancing and music,which often gets under the skin of his assistant Griggs(Fred Clark), who tries to keep his empire running as smoothly as possible. On a diplomatic mission to Paris with others,the car they are in gets stuck. Jervis wanders off to get help and comes upon an orphanage. While there he is struck by the charm and exuberance of a teenage girl by the name of Julie Andre(Caron).He confronts the American ambassador with a plan to adopt the girl and to bring her to the States to be educated. The ambassador questions his real motivations and a compromise is reached when it is agreed just to sponsor her;a less offending and questionable course of action. Of course Jervis's motives ARE strictly honourable and it is set up that the only interaction he will have with the girl is to receive regular correspondence from her regarding her school work. Andre is of course ecstatic and attends a college in Massachusetts that the Pendletons have sponsored for years. She does well with her studies and sends Jervis regular letters;none of which get answered. Griggs has been intercepting them and giving them to his secretary Alicia(Thelma Ritter)who reads them and dutifully files them away. When Alicia can't take the poor Julie's feelings of rejection anymore she pressures Griggs who in turn finally talks with Jervis. Jervis who had completely forgotten about his charge finally sits down to read the letters. He is touched and attends the college under the pretense of visiting his niece,who is Julie's roommate. They get to dance together and Jervis by nights end is quite taken with her. When she graduates he sets her up in a penthouse apartment in Manhattan. Everything is quite platonic but the feelings between the two are obviously growing. The American ambassador from the beginning of the film happens to over hear and misconstrue a conversation the two are having on their terrace. He calls Jervis and confronts him about what he heard. Even though it was innocent Jervis finally realizes what it looks like and agrees to stop things before they go any further. He travels the world but Julie follows his every move,clipping newspapers. Still not knowing that Jervis is really her ""Daddy Long Legs""/benefactor she again writes to him urgently for advice. Alicia can take no more and brings Julie back to NYC to see Jervis in person. Jervis realizes he can't fight what he feels any longer and agrees to see her. Julie is taken aback in that first moment but soon realizes things couldn't be better. The movie ends with the two embraced.
Filming started in early /54 only to be sidelined due to the death of his beloved wife Phyllis. Astaire wanted out of the project but it was agreed to postpone the filming for a few months to let him grieve. Astaire finally came back but still very much upset. He made it through the film and thankfully his dancing does not suffer in the least. He has a great moment near the beginning of the film where he is drumming to some bigband music(very proficiently I might add) and he does a nice routine away from the drum kit with drum sticks in hand. He next becomes a dream like representation of what Julie thinks an American millionaire would look like. Astaire is in a Texas outfit c/w hat and boots and his singing is overdubbed by the venerable talent of Thurl Ravenscroft(Tony the Tiger).Astaire then does a high energy kick up your heels swing dance with Caron and other dancers in the ""Slu-Foot"" number. Finally he sings his famous""Something's Gotta Give"" to Caron,quite reminiscent of his Ginger days. Leslie Caron was discovered by Fred's friend Gene Kelly and the latter starred her in An American in Paris four years before,so Fred asked for her for this project. Caron had(dance wise)more of a ballet background and the musical numbers were geared to reflect that. Caron had trouble with some of the routines and conquered it through constant rehearsal. The trouble I found is her dancing generally comes off as quite stiff and uninspiring. She has an an entire 12 minute sequence in which to shine and the results are disappointing,to say the least. Her best moments come with Astaire in the ""Slu-foot"" number and in the finale of the film. It is evident the studio was trying to highlight Caron but a sequence like Caron thinking about her ""Daddy Long Legs"" at a blackboard at the orphanage are flat and could easily have been cut(with her ballet number)with no harm to the film whatsoever.
Costar Fred Clark as always provides good support in his role as Griggs,the over worked and frustrated secretary to Jervis. Thelma Ritter as Griggs' assistant Alicia also has some good moments on screen to help things along.
The movie I would give about a 3 1/2 star rating to. However the technical department is the area this particular release really shines in and bumps the rating up to a solid four. The 2:55:1 aspect ratio along with the absolute pristine and gorgeous transfer evident here is something to behold. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The DVD comes with some nice extras:there is additional commentary by Ken Barnes,Astaire's daughter Eva and songwriter Johnny Mercer,Fox movietone news footage of the Hollywood,New York and London premieres of the movie,still photos,the trailer and four repro lobby cards of the film. The DVD itself is in its own case and it is in turn covered by another matching outer sleeve. This is prevalent amongst Fox's recent ""Marquee Musicals"" collection series.
Finally,while the movie itself would only rate between 3 and four stars,the extras and print here bump it up to a solid four. The film can be uneven at times,due mainly to sequences unfortunately involving Astaires co star Leslie Caron. Astaire suffered personally through this film but his anguish does not come across on screen and his dancing is up to his usual standards. I can recommend this film and Astaire fans will find more than a few satisfying moments to relish.",1265155200,,6397,4.858974358974359
428563,3,6302136261,"Must be (obviously) that times were different in the '50's.  Mr. Astaire (and Mr. Kelly) were quite senior to the lovely Ms. Caron; this made it difficult to accept the 'plots' of 'Daddy...' or 'American...'.  Perhaps that is not the point; the dancing and the music is outstanding.  That is what counts, I know.  Still, the 'age thing' is like a tiny grain in one's eye; it can be quite distracting.

428609,2,6302136261,"It's just that the script was really flimsy to begin with. A college-bound orphan, even one from Paris, would be a little more street-wise. Instead, we get an overgrown child who spends an inordinate time writing to her benefactor. She is angry that she has not heard from him during much of her college enrollment.

Frankly, I don't find that a plausible development at all.

Instead of getting involved on campus, or seriously attending to her studies to make attending college academically worthwhile--she's pouting. Really, she should be grateful that she's even getting to attend college and won't have to worry about how it's being paid for.

This film made me feel sorry for Fred Astaire--who obviously has awesome dance moves.

I can't believe an agent actually encouraged him to take this part. Sure it was a showcase for his dancing, but some of the lines which he had to utter besides were pure camp. The guy deserved better!",1196035200,3,936,4.867924528301887
428610,2,6302136261,"This is the first Fred Astaire movie that I've ever quit watching midway through.  It's really more of a showcase for Leslie Caron, who was sort of a French Annette Funicello -- although she's likeable enough, her personality and talents seem singularly underwhelming, especially when you've got Astaire waiting in the wings, twiddling his thumbs.  The film starts out great, with a scene of Fred banging away on the drums, keeping time to a jazz record and talking hep lingo... But it loses oompf midway through, and Astaire recedes into the background for far too long.  It's an okay movie, but there are many, many better films to be seen.",1184025600,4,642,4.818181818181818
428611,4,6302136261,"I think this is one of Fred Astaire's best.  A lot of people rave about ""Top Hat,"" but I like his later movies better.  His dancing is exceptional.  The only problem I have with the film is it's another of the ""teen age girl falls in love with old man"" movies.  That hasn't changed much over the years if you've seen any Clint Eastwood movies.  Of course, I am an old man who would like to think it could happen to me.

Fred is a ""stand-up, elegant"" dancer compared with Gene Kelly who is a ""squat low, gymnastics"" dancer. Both are great.  In this film, I think Leslie Caron was superb.  She had an air of innocence which she portrayed very well and she is such a lovely dancer.  I think she fits as a dance partner better with Fred that with Gene who is better suited with someone like Cyd Charisse.

I saw the movie when it first came out in 1955 and several times since.  It has remained one of my favorites because of the music and dance routines more than the storyline.  I would have purchased it earlier, but it wasn't digitized for DVD until 2005 and I didn't want the VHS version.

If you are a fan of musicals like I am, you will love this film.",1174608000,9,1155,4.171945701357466
428612,5,6302136261,"This is a Musical for the discerning. Someone who appreciates the way things 'use to be'. Mr Astaire executes with effortless elegance, grace and 100% charm.

A Youthful Leslie Caron almost flawlessly mirrors Mr. Astaire's natural effortlessness and makes you wish that you had enough talent to look so relaxed partnering a legendary entertainer.

If you enjoy the innocent/natural charisma of a bygone era with its genteel elegance....you cannot go past this classic!

On the downside [purely personal taste] I think that Miss Caron's 'fade to dream dance sequences' are too long and too numerous to hold my attention and don't add enough 'value' to the overall storyline.

Ultimately, Uncle Jervis is everyone woman's dream man [fully loaded, without the traditional 'drop dead/georgeous' skin deep covering...but what he lacks in 'looks' is outweighed by his endless charm, charisma and downright Godgiven talent! Delightful!",1172016000,2,928,5.468531468531468

428616,3,6302136261,"In 1955, Fred Astaire appeared in his first and only Fox film, a musical remake of Jean Webster story 'Daddy Long Legs.' He played a carefree millionaire who anonymously befriends and comes to love a young French orphan... This was the 3rd version of Jean Webster's popular novel...

Filmed in 1919 as a vehicle for Mary Pickford and again in 1931 with Janet Gaynor and Warner Baxter, the story seemed more old and picturesque for the mid-fifties... As usual, 20th Century Fox gave it a lavish production to hide its age, and photographed it in De Luxe Color and CinemaScope... Musical numbers include: ""Hong Kong,"" ""Texas Millionaire,"" ""International Playboy,"" ""Guardian Angel,"" Sluefoot,"" ""Welcome Egghead,"" and ""Dream.""

Leslie Caron was cast opposite Fred Astaire as the helpless orphan who falls for her patron..

Astaire and Caron dance together on several occasions, but not always successfully.. It is not the difference in their ages but their contrasting expressive styles that cause the lack of harmony... Astaire's unique style was his ability to mix Tap and ballroom with grace and ease... Astaire had an air of style, sophistication and gay spontaneity... Caron was spectacularly charming... She dances beautifully... She had passion, a complete commitment to her art and the power to communicate through movement...

The high-point of the film is their ""Sluefoot"" dance, where they seem to be incompatible..

Astaire's best number is his song and dance to the wonderful Johnny Mercer song 'Something Gotta Give.'",1166832000,,1527,5.267489711934156
428681,5,6302136261,"Rather than repeat the many attributes of this film, it is interesting to note that Fred Astaire initially did not want to make this film.

His wife died of cancer prior to the start of production, and it has been documented that he actually offered 20th Century Fox to pay their production costs to bow out of the film due to his grief.  However, his family and colleagues talked him into doing it as part of overcoming his sorrow.  The only time you note any type of hurt on his face is during his brief ""walk on"" during the ""Rio"" number.  Otherwise, it shows nowhere else in the film.  He was such a class act and professional.

From the wonderful Leslie Caron and the excellent supporting cast, it is a charming story of the 1950's and should be taken as that.  In today's cynical world, people would intrepret Jervis Pennelton's motives as something more sinister, but back then it could be taken as a romantic story.  Actually, Jervis was such a likeable person, especially with his encounters with the U.S. Ambassador, Griggs, and the college students at the ""Sluefoot"" dance.  Manners meant something back then, and Fred always showed this in the way he acted.  How many celebrities do you see today act that way?

The set designs, photography, and that beautiful black Cadillac shown in the beginning of the film show a classy sense of style that taken over 50 years later, show how movies have changed.

For great movie music, Johnny Mercer demonstrated some absolutely wonderful pieces that still sound great today.  The excellent playing of the Fox orchestra by Alfred Newman, Leon Shamroy's superb cinematography, and the print used for the DVD were the best I have seen the move in years.  I own the laserdisc version, and even then, the DVD is fantastic.

The only criticism I have is not with the movie, but rather the loud, obnoxious disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD about piracy.  The people who watch this movie are not some punk kids or pirates making bootleg copies and have to be reminded that it is stealing.  I own several of the Marilyn Monroe series and Fox does not put that blaring message on those DVDs.  Turner/Warner DVDs for example, put the FBI message at the front with NO SOUND, and they make the point.  Also, the Deluxe Credit for DVD mastering at the end is similar.  Apparently, they record the levels of the both the piracy notice and Deluxe Labs at a sound level of 10dB louder than the movie.  The first time I watched it, I thought I was going to blow out my speakers.

Otherwise, Fox did an excellent job on this DVD.  The commentary with Ava Astaire, Ken Barnes, and archival interview with Johnny Mercer is worth the price of the DVD alone.  All together, a must have in any collection of classic musicals.  The digital audio is absolutely superb in either a two channel or 5:1 Home Theater.  A must own DVD.",1162684800,8,2860,4.602766798418973
428682,4,6302136261,I just loved Leslie Caron's clothing in this movie - it's worth watching just to look at the wonderful clothing style of that era.,1143763200,,130,4.458333333333333
428683,2,6302136261,"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy.",1142121600,3,930,5.038961038961039
428684,4,6302136261,"When Fox upgraded from Studio Classics to Cinema Classics brand, they upgraded the price too.  What you get are a larger booklet insert, four ""lobby cards"" and a slipcase.  This title, ""Pin Up Girl"" and ""Week-End in Havana"" are each missing 3 of the 4 lobby cards.  Twentieth Century Fox is aware of the problem, but offers no replacement for defective packages.

Other than that, the film is great fun and it's wonderful to have another Astaire classic on DVD.",1140825600,5,461,4.725
428685,5,6302136261,"Daddy Long Legs is a really great movie. It stars Fred Astaire, Leslie Caron (An American in Paris), Terry Moore, Thelma Ritter, and Fred Clark. The movie is about millionaire Jervis Pendleton (Fred Astaire) who secretly sponsers French orphan Julie Andre (Leslie Caron). Jervis sends Julie to college in America to give her a good education. Jerveis secretary Miss Pritchard (Ritter) finally persuades him to visit Julie. They finally meet and Jervis falls in love with her. This movie has many great numbers, which include:

History of the Beat- Fred is actually on drums for this number. In real life Fred did play the drums.

C-A-T Spells Cat- Leslie sings this to the children at the orphange.

Welcome Egghead- The girls at Julie's college sing this to her.

The Daydream Sequence- Julie daydreams about what her sponser is like. She has many ideas including a Texas millionaire, International Playboy, and a guardain angel.

Dream- This is sung by a chrous and is danced by Fred Astaire and Leslie Caron. Fred sings this later on in the movie.

Sluefoot- Fred and Leslie dance to this at a dance. A great number. One of my favorites!

Something's Gotta Give- Fred sings this song and he dances to it with Leslie. I think this is the best number! A personal favorite!

Dancing Through Life- Leslie dances in this big ballet number. It's kinda like the American in Paris ballet in An American in Paris. A very enjoyable segment.

Dream- A chorus sings this while Fred and Leslie dance!

Another favorite!

Daddy Long Legs is a really good movie. It may be long but it is a great musical. I recommend it if you enjoy musicals, or if your a big fan of Fred Astaire or Leslie Caron. Leslie may seem too young for Fred but if you get over that one fact it's a great movie. The numbers in this movie are done really well also. I highly recommend this movie!",1139011200,13,2221,4.807387862796833
428686,5,6302136261,"One of my favorite Fred Astaire musicals.  Unlike some, I have no problem with the age difference in the romance between Astaire and Leslie Caron.  Also, Caron plays Julie as rather flirtatious and sophisticated for someone who's a very young woman, and she actually makes the initial advances to the intrigued (but rather taken-aback) Jervis.  The music (by Johnny Mercer) is lovely -- ""Dream"" and ""Something's Gotta Give"" in particular.  The dance to ""Something's Gotta Give"" is wonderful, but my very favorite is the athletic ""Sluefoot"", in which Astaire and Caron dance with a college-age ensemble.  It's a real treat to see how joyously light on his feet Astaire still is, and the way his effortless grace and stamina wittily shows up those college ""whippersnappers"" who've been talking to him like he's a dottering old codger.  And there's a touchingly romantic ending, rather more romantic than Astaire movies usually indulge in, but I love it.  I only wish they'd come out with this one in a nice DVD version, so far it's only on VHS.",1125014400,5,1042,4.92

428688,5,6302136261,"DADDY LONG LEGS, Jean Webster's novel of a young orphan being sponsored by a mysterious benefactor, is perfect material for a splashy movie musical and the result is this 1955 charmer starring Leslie Caron and Fred Astaire.

Jervis Pendleton III (Fred Astaire) is a rich playboy with little care for the outside world.  On a business trip to Paris, he encounters Julie Andre (Leslie Caron) an enchanting 18-year-old orphan.  Determined to see her succeed, he sends her to a college in America.

Leslie Caron looks beautiful and Fred Astaire is suave and charming.  The score features the hit song ""Something's Gotta Give"" as well as the infectious dance number ""Slue-Foot"".  Roland Petit and his ballet company staged the several striking dream sequences (they also contributed the ballet sequences in the Leslie Caron vehicle THE GLASS SLIPPER, and Caron was a pupil of Petit's).

Also featuring Fred Clark, Thelma Ritter, Terry Moore,  Kathleen Giveny and Ray Anthony's orchestra.

(Watching this film again, I suddenly realized that three of my favorite movies have her as a supporting player: Daddy Long Legs, All About Eve and Pillow Talk).
