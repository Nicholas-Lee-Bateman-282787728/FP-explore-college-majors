4523027,5,B0051MKMNC,"This is an absolutely fantastic action/suspense movie, the acting is great, the story pulls you in, and I really couldn't tell what was going to happen next at any point! I went in to it expecting an average modern movie with all the same parts that I regret spending money on, but this is going to be the first movie in a long time I will buy on DVD the day it comes out! The plot, the idea is just all around great and let me tell you - I left wishing I was a thousand times more productive! Since seeing it, I feel like I could be Bradley Cooper's character if I put in the effort - and that's something that pops into my head occasionally, so this movie clearly had a major impact on me!",1302134400,2,691,4.0510948905109485
4523028,5,B0051MKMNC,"Limitless is a great idea for a movie.  The idea of acquiring fantastic mental powers by simply taking a pill is probably appealing to most of us. The urge to be a genius instead of limited selves is a nice fantasy.  This is exactly where Eddie Mora (Bradley Cooper) finds himself.  Eddie begins the film as a perennial looser. He has an advance to write a book but can't find a way to begin or even articulate what the book is about.  Enter Eddie's sleazy former brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who has a pill that allows people to access 100% of their brain.

(Some Spoiler Below)
One doze of the drug (randomly named NZT-48 and definitely not FDA approved) allows Eddie to begin writing a fantastic book and is able to recall things long buried in his memory.  Eddie wants more of the drug and shows up at Vernon's apartment first a little beaten up then very dead and his apartment turned upside down.  Clearly, someone was looking for the NZT - but did they find it?  Eddie starts looking and just as he is about to give up, he discovers a bag filled with pills, money and a notebook with the names of clients.  With the drug, Eddie turns his life around.  He completes his book, becomes a successful investor and the love of his girlfriend Lindsey.  He is noticed by Carl van Loon (nicely played by Robert De Nero) who is a Warren Buffett-like mover and shaker.

The story becomes cautionary. Eddie takes more of the NZT than he should and soon begins to experience period when the Hyde part of his personality takes over. He can't remember where he has been or what he has done.  He meets his once brilliant ex-wife who burned out taking the drug and we find out the taking it can lead to severe illness and death. So, who else is on NZT?
(End Spoilers)

Barry Cooper plays Eddie as a likeable average guy who has nothing but problems.  The drug eliminates his obstacles and he becomes dangerously overconfident as he learns Italian in minutes to impress a woman and understands complex financial data but simply looking at it. Limitless has a lot of suspense as Eddie's life becomes more complicated and he is threatened by someone who clearly knows he has the drug and then by a Russian loan shark named Gennady. Robert De Nero is his professional best in the supporting part of Carl Van Loon, who is impressed with Eddie but also has some reservations.  Abbie Cornish is good as Eddie's girlfriend and Andrew Howard makes an effective villain as Gennady.  The CG work that fills in Eddie's experience when he looses control of the drug pulls and twists what he sees effectively. Anyone who gets motion sickness easily will want to look away.

Some reviewers wanted to have more of De Nero in the film but his role was not especially prominent.  The movie is well paced and holds your attention from the start. Limitless is worth a look and probably is even better the second time around.",1301961600,,2906,4.553846153846154
4523029,1,B0051MKMNC,"I regret seeing Limitless! The violence is excessive and disturbing. PG-13 doesn't mean very much anymore! The current movie rating system in the United States is an absolute joke and it should be abolished!  Have a sex/violence activity rating system like they do on Common Sense Media! At least that would be much more honest! When stabbing out a man's eye and making him blind (he was already blind in the other eye) is PG-13, then what's next? Scraping it out with a spoon?",1301702400,16,477,4.678571428571429
4523030,2,B0051MKMNC,"This is a drug film. It came across as a not even thinly veiled ode to the greatness of Methamphedamine (Speed) and/or Cocaine. Its compleatly unashamed in its message and it doesn't take one step back from it all the way to the end. The message is that drugs are great and that all the risks can be managed by a smart addict. All the scifi aspects of the film do is serve to exaggerate the real-world boost of drugs.

All the hallmarks are here. The world becomes brighter when the drug is taken. He goes and parties continuously for days. He can crank out work. He suddenly starts cleaning his apartment compulsively in the middle of the night. he forgets to eat. He does damage to his body. He has blackouts. His woman friend who was on the drug for a long time is now prematurely aged. We even get the guys drug dealer disguised as a high-interest loan shark. And you get large numbers of contemporaries dying. There is even all the addict paranoia about hiding and losing a pile of drugs. They also have him so in love with his drugs that he literally licks them off the floor.

And best of all, they use two professions in the film where drug use is rather common (wall street and writers).

But what the film gets wrong is that drugs don't make people smarter or teach them foreign languages instantly. They speed you up and give you limitless energy and make you more confident. You can get more done, but not because your smarter. But because you can work 2x to 3x longer.

Where the film falls down is in showing the long-term price. It didn't show his body wearing out. It didn't show the paranoia or the teeth falling out. It didn't show that as drug use goes on you get diminishing returns. You may be able to crank out pages in a book, but they cease to be good pages. They also miss the costs of not being able to properly sleep.

On the positive side, right up to the happy ending its probably one of the best films I can think of in capturing the deluded mentality of a new heavy drug addict. But its not generally a good message to be out pushing. And the film doesn't capture at all what happens in the long term.

The plans of the main character are fairly lame. He wants to get rich on wall street and the become president. Why? He has a plan to make everything better. And typical of drug logic, we never find out what that plan is. I also don't remember if we ever found out if he had or had not killed a woman during a blackout. But he clearly is involved in the murder of a lawyer for messing with his stash.

I could have lived with the film minus the happy ending. But ending it in the way they did made a pro-drug film.

Robert De Niro is in the film basically doing a character actor role as the big man on wall street. Its a completely workmanlike performance. His name on a film still sells tickets but you really wonder how many times can get away with it putting his name on something he has no personal investment in.

Somebody came up with a new continous zoom effect for the film. Its an interesting effect and it communicates well to the viewer the sense of being trapping at full speed thats at the heart of the film. Its maybe used a little too much and they pulled it out way too early. But it was a nice original touch.

The film is essentially told from the narrative point of view of the main character. Bradley Cooper pulls it off well. His girlfriend is basically a prop character.

Technically and in terms of acting, its a good film. But the script and its message are rather questionable.",1301702400,10,3536,4.278443113772455
4523031,5,B0051MKMNC,"Mostly, films go in one side of my head and right out the other.  If I can remember a film I saw Friday, on Monday, that's unusual.

It's been a couple weeks since I saw this.  It's still there in my memory.

I think there are several reasons, not necessarily in order of importance:

1) The opening credits are worth the price of admission on their own.  Whatever you were thinking when you sat down in the theater, you're transported immediately to somewhere else... wherever that will turn out to be.  Amazing and outstanding!

2) The overall plot is Hitchcock-esque.  You don't know what's going to happen, and cliches are out the window.  As the story builds, the suspense is palpable.

3) The visuals... This isn't on the scale of an AVATAR, but parts of it approach The Matrix.  This movie is really a trip-and-a-half.

4) The performances, and dramatic direction, are excellent, as are many other production factors, including music, that don't smack you in the face but which are indispensible to the experience.

5) The ending is entirely non-cliche and unpredictable.  Hitchcock would be proud to have directed it.

So, although it isn't populated with super-star actors and actresses (yet), this is a blockbuster, destined for cult fame and longevity.

The more I think about it, the more I like it.",1301443200,53,1311,4.807174887892376
4523032,4,B0051MKMNC,"A struggling writer takes a pill that enables the user to access the parts of the brain that are not utilized, allowing him to function at an extremely high level. It turns out that this is an untested narcotic, and has serious side effects. He is pursued by others who want to benefit from the drug. This was a very engaging and original storyline, with the identity of a man following the writer a true mystery until the story is concluding. The spectacle of an individual opening up his mind, enabling him to devise clever ways to endure, and also to reach an intellectual level previously unseen, is cool. Nice work on this one.",1301270400,,632,4.552631578947368
4523033,3,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" gets off to a strong start - a dicey character hands out ""smart pills"" that really work. Pop one, and you're suddenly brilliant. In the case of this down-and-out writer, that means not just getting started on that novel stalled because of writer's block, but finishing in just a few days. Of course, being that brilliant becomes addictive.

The story moves along well. First, his dealer ends up dead. (What would a smrt guy do with that clue?) Then,to finance his venture, he borrows from the local loan shark (not so smart). Next, he flaunts his new-found ability as day trader, building up his financial head of steam - and I have to wonder whether taking such a high profile so fast was really a good idea.

Things get out of hand, though. The loan shark gets his hands on the pill, and dicovers that being a smart crook is more fun than just being a crook. And there are side effects - the kind that kill not just you, but maybe other people, too ...

This should have been an August movie. Just a few too many things seem just a bit too implausible for anything but a silly season flick. But, if you stifle your own intelligence, it's enjoyable enough.

4523034,3,B0051MKMNC,"Sometimes movies have concepts so grand and large-scale that potential viewers can't help but imagine to themselves in advance what they would do with such technology, powers, knowledge, etc.  Imagine if you had the ability to travel through time.  What would you do?  When would you go?  Our imaginations are sparked, and thus, movies about time travel are often disappointing, because their reach never achieves what we'd imagine ourselves doing.

LIMITLESS suffers from this as well.  Bradley Cooper plays an author with a serious case of writer's block.  He's smart, but messy and disorganized.  He's handsome but can't be bothered to take care of his appearance.  And he can't get going on the book he's supposed to write.  His girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) is finally tired of him and leaves.  But hope arrives in the form of a new drug that he is given by a distant acquaintance.  It will allow him to access ""100% of his brain.""  Suddenly he's got phenomenal cognitive abilities...particularly the ability to take random scraps of past things he's encountered and to put them together into patterns that no one else can recognize.  It's like the chess player who can envision every possible move and the outcomes of each of those moves.  Cooper finishes his book (and it's brilliant) and then sets about making some serious money with his new powers.

With such incredible powers, he seems to strive to accomplish relatively little.  Yes, he wants to make money...that is certainly understandable and relatable.  But he doesn't see a big pattern for himself.  And as a viewer, I was constantly distracted by thinking...""wow, if I had HIS abilities, I'd do so much more.""  It felt a little bit like a failure of the imagination on the part of the filmmakers.  Thus, I felt vaguely disappointed in the film...a great idea that boiled down to a somewhat predictable ""corporate espionage"" kind of thing.

Because Cooper discovers that this drug wasn't exactly developed with the approval of the FDA.  The side-effects, particularly of not taking the drug every day, are unpleasant.  And there are some unpleasant, even murderous folks who want the drug, or at least want the abilities that Cooper now has to work to their advantage.  Who can he trust?  How will he get away from all the folks who are now following him?  What will he do when his stock of pills runs out?

It's all interesting but a bit generic.  Cooper makes a pretty good leading man here, but he generates little chemistry with the bland Abbie Cornish...so we are not terribly invested in their relationship.  Robert DeNiro is on hand to collect a paycheck as a big shot executive trying to pull of the most ambitious corporate merger in history...and he needs the talent Cooper brings to the table.

The most amusing part of the movie is when Cooper has to borrow his initial stake in the stock market from a Russian loan shark, who inadvertently discovers the pill Cooper is taking.  Suddenly, this thuggish character becomes a LOT more dangerous to Cooper than the corporate big-shots.  This showed some creativity and the menace and humor of these scenes was welcome.

I recommend LIMITLESS, but my admiration is not...well...limitless.  Cooper is good.  The basic concept is intriguing.  The ""action"" shenanigans are fairly tense, but feel lifted from hundreds of movies that came before.  I realize this is a lazy thing to say, but I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD.",1300838400,2,3447,4.889464594127807
4523035,3,B0051MKMNC,"Have you ever been really intrigued by the concept of a film, but pretty much knew deep down that the movie would probably suck? That was my initial thought process going into Limitless. The concept of a drug (NZT) actually being able to unlock the maximum capacity of a person's brain with unlimited potential is extremely fascinating to me. Maybe it's because Bradley Cooper has mostly been in subpar films or the fact that Robert De Niro has been giving us ""okay"" to ""what the hell happened to De Niro?"" performances for over a decade, but trailers for Limitless just left you feeling empty like you knew ahead of time that they were going to blow it somehow. Surprisingly enough, Limitless isn't half as bad as expected and may be slightly better than you think.

The camera work is probably the first thing you'll notice as the opening credits use a unique zoom-in technique that mostly has us traveling through the back windshield of a countless number of cars in the type of traffic you'd expect in New York. This zoom-in technique is used several times throughout the film and, to be honest, makes you a little nauseous. As intriguing as it was, it actually wound up making me feel like I was just trapped on a carousel stuck on full speed. The use of color was a nice touch, as well. Whenever somebody first used NZT, the world became brighter. It was like they were seeing the world through a new set of eyes. The choreography went on to stand out a few more times throughout the film, as well. When Eddie (Cooper) finally sits down to write his novel, letters begin to rain down from his ceiling. When he first starts the stock market game, he glances up at his ceiling at one point and the tiles begin flipping around as Eddie sees the stock market play out on his ceiling. Things like that were a nice touch to make what would otherwise be an ordinary scene more memorable.

The cast seemed rather lukewarm though. Bradley Cooper seemed to give the strongest performance of the bunch, but that's probably because we spend the most time with his Eddie Morra character. Hearing Eddie's narrative throughout the film managed to add a bit more depth though. Hearing his thought process and him voicing how he felt helped add a little to the film and his character. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro were really disappointing though. Cornish was able to display fear in one scene and basically came off as indecisive the rest of the time while seemingly just going through the motions. Robert De Niro has one scene that's fairly memorable; the scene where his character, Carl Van Loon, gives his ""don't make me your competition"" speech. It honestly just seemed like De Niro was grossly misused the entire film while Van Loon felt like a watered down version of De Niro's Senator McLaughlin character in Machete without any sort of ridiculous fun injected into him.

The film did seem a little slow to get the ball rolling, but is pretty decent once it picks up around the halfway point. Any film that gets the wheels turning in your head because of its concept or makes you think about what you'd do in their shoes while using this fictitious product isn't all bad, in my book. Films that make you think can be a good thing even if it's something entirely different from what's taking place on-screen. There is one scene involving blood that'll probably make you want to puke. If you were in Eddie's situation, you'd probably do the same thing. But in the meantime, it's really...REALLY disgusting.

The biggest downfall for Limitless is that its concept is almost bigger than the rest of the film. The film is centered around this fantastic idea that doesn't seem to be fleshed out to its maximum potential. The final product though isn't all bad. With an intriguing storyline, a strong performance from Bradley Cooper, and some fairly captivating cinematography, Limitless comes off as an above average thriller that you won't feel entirely cheated on seeing that rainy day you decide to see it since nothing else looks good.",1300579200,3,4034,4.693502824858757
4523036,5,B0051MKMNC,"A blocked writer (played by Bradley Cooper) with average intelligence and a very low drive for success comes into possession of an unreleased drug that makes him a super genius. The movie's premise is that we only use a very small percentage of our brains, and the drug gets the body to use 100% of the brain.

In the movie, the writer only has a limited supply of the drug with no way to get more. The plot thickens since the drug has side effects and others are after his supply.

If I could give half stars, I'd give this movie a 4 1/2. It was very good, and definitely worth seeing, but there have been some movies more deserving of the full 5 stars. Still, this movie has a lot going for it. Here what's good:

1. The premise of this movie is unique. It's a great fantasy. Who wouldn't want that level of smarts. He's able to protect himself, make a killing on Wall Street and even impress women by ordering dinner speaking Italian. Just pop a pill and you're able to pretty much conquer the world. Great concept.

2. I like movies with smart heroes. This movie has that - well sometimes. The trouble with our hero is that without the drug he's an average guy who's sincere but not all that interesting, smart or even very likable. And when he's on the drug he's almost all about making money and having fun.

In the characters favor, he does sincerely love a woman, and he honestly wants to be the better man she needs and deserves. Or at least to appear that way.

Regardless of his flaws, the movie pulls you in, and you'll care about Bradley's character. This is usually essential for a movie to be good, and this movie succeeds in that. Cooper does an excellent job portraying the character in all his states.

3. This is not a special effects movie, but the cinematography and special effects were really well done. They were a major part of moving the story along, helping you understand what was happening to Bradley Cooper's character, and helping you get inside his head.

4. There was some suspense, action and danger that made the story exciting. The fact that the drug was going to run out and had dangerous side effects worked similar to a ticking bomb, always in the back of your mind. The movie kept to a good pace. It was almost always interesting and sometimes exciting. There were interesting plot twists. You don't always know what's coming next.

Here's what's not quite as good:

1. I wanted to like the lead character even more. I didn't quite identify with him personally. However others might.

2. I would have liked the love story to have been more developed. I think it would resulted in pulling the audience into the story in a more intense way.

3. Of course De Niro is an amazing actor, however his role was kind of small and not particularly high impact. I don't think the role was a great fit for him.

Regardless, I'd definitely recommend this movie. It's exciting and interesting, and I'd watch it again. Anyone who likes sci-fi, thrillers and suspense will want to check this movie out.",1300492800,158,3026,4.489981785063752

4523138,3,B0051MKMNC,"3/5  LIMITLESS is a slick, rollercoaster ride of a movie. It bowls the viewer along, heading with unapologetic alacrity and absurdity towards a goal it never quite reaches. Its the Hollywood equivalent of junk food. There are many glaring inconsistencies in the script but it doesnt really matter  just disengage your power of reasoning and enjoy the ride. The cast are accomplished, if a little underwhelming, although Cooper is quite impressive in the lead role. The concept is interesting but the script flounders somewhat in its attempt to explore the consequences of Morras astonishing, chemically-fuelled intellect and instead falls back on rather predictable abuse-of-power tropes. While this is an entertaining film, and it never bores for a moment, it does not bear close scrutiny and is instantly forgettable once seen.",1505606400,,829,5.369230769230769

4523149,3,B0051MKMNC,"Smart pills (nootropics), if such things are even possible, should have made Eddie Morra wiser and more cautious, but instead he did wild speculation on the stock market, and became involved in a risky business merger. Then he borrowed money from a known criminal! When Eddie heard that users of NZT were dying or getting very sick, he should have immediately sought professional medical help.
But he did not, which seems to imply that NZT was an extremely dangerous stimulant, not a true nootropic. After a year, the viewer is not sure whether Eddie has wisened up, or whether he is headed for even more dangerous adventures. The photography was jerky and poorly edited, and the dialogue was choppy. Viewer, please do not experiment with dangerous drugs!",1503273600,,755,4.952755905511811

4523152,5,B0051MKMNC,"It's such an interesting concept. All the actors play their role very well, and I'm sure everybody could use NZT at one time or another.",1502496000,,136,4.48
4523153,5,B0051MKMNC,"Limitless is a movie (and later a short lived TV series) based on the urban legend that people can only access a fraction of their brain's power/function/potential.  Bradley Cooper plays the typical movie version of a down on his luck guy named Eddie Morra, who is dead broke, wears ratty clothes etc.  He is a writer trying to finish a book and he comes across a drug called NZT, which allows a person taking it to access 100% of their brain's ability, turning them into an instant genius.

Through a series of events that I will not detail so as not to spoil it, Eddie becomes a highly successful financial wizard, but the side effects of the drug, getting in bad with a loan shark, and the perils of the big money financial world all end up getting in his way.  The story is not what I would call overly complex and does take a bit of suspension of disbelief to accept, but it is entertaining enough that it is easy to enjoy.  The acting is also very good with Cooper having to play a range of life situations for Eddie, and hold his own against Robert DeNiro.

For those who get the blu-ray, the movie looks and sounds great.  For extras there are a couple short making of and behind the scenes features.  An extended edition of the movie that really just adds a total of a couple minutes to the theatrical version run time, but does not change the story, a commentary track by the director, and an alternate ending.  The alternate ending actually leads much better into the TV series than the original ending that both the theatrical and extended edition show.  All in all, good for what is there.

Like I said it is not a complex story.  It is good to watch for any fan of the show, because while it is not necessary to get what is going on in the show, it is nice to see the backstory of the character of Eddie, who only makes brief almost cameo appearances in the television series.  It is a good way to spend an hour and  a half or so if you are looking for something different to watch.",1502409600,,1996,4.302139037433155

4523338,3,B0051MKMNC,"The acting saved this movie. Bradley Cooper came off like a New York native and kept the pace up until the bitter end. De Niro, although master of his craft, was restrained by a smaller, less dimensional part. Being a De Niro fan, I would've loved to see more from him in a more dynamic role.

The movie itself is another drug movie, with a formulaic drug movie plot: Loser finds drugs, drugs are good, drugs get an awesome life, something bad happens (cops are on the trail, bad guys are trying to get money/drugs or both, guy tries to figure a way out), then main character either dies or manages to get out of the game.

I did enjoy the brief insider looks into philosophical premises though. Human being really only do use a small port of our brain and mind and this movie does attempt to answer, ""what if we used all of our brain?""

I've known people in grad school who got their hands on adderall and modafinil and had the same ride this guy did. Other than Cooper and De Niro in a film together, I don't see what the fanfare was about.",1479427200,,1042,4.279187817258883

This story has no moral whatsoever because of the senseless ending.

4523402,5,B0051MKMNC,"We started watching the television program ""Limitless"" only to discover --when we were 4 episodes into the storyline-- that it was preceded by a film featuring the same crucial character: Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morra. So we decided to watch the 2011 film.

Limitless is suspenseful and everything that you could want in a science-fiction-style film focused on financial and political ""conspiracies"". Bradley Cooper is completely charming and invites us to care about his immediate future and ultimate survival. It has enough twists and turns to keep you interested and potentially surprised!

The only reason that I/we thought of rating the film at a 4 rather than a 5 is that the ending of the film leaves you unprepared for the person that Eddie Mora is the the continuing story of Limitless-- the tv show. Granted, that may be a fault of the current writers of the series rather than the previous writers of the film. Both productions have Neil Burger in common (developer of the film and one of the executive producers of the tv series), and yet the Eddie Mora of 2015 has changed in ways that the 4-year gap on storylines does not account for as a single fact. I find it a bit difficult to believe that Eddie Mora as depicted in 2011 would become Eddie Mora as depicted in 2015-- but perhaps we have not watched enough episodes of the tv series to understand the changes in character.

Regardless -- it is not reasonable to judge a film character and storyline by a later iteration of a character as part of a continuing storyline -- so the film gets its 5 stars! However -- DO watch the film before the television series. It is possible that the character evolution that I did not perceive will be blindingly obvious to you. Both projects are well done and peopled with excellent characters. Enjoy!",1474243200,,1805,4.705696202531645

In the series the drug is the gimmick for another enhanced spy/crimefighter series. What I like about the film is how seriously it embraces the whole addiction/abuse metaphor. And after seeing the series, the question of the protagonist of the movie being a sociopath is heightened. In this day of body and brain enhancement, this serves as a cautionary tale. It's smart and the visuals are great.",1473206400,,550,4.565656565656566

4523504,4,B0051MKMNC,"I recently reordered this movie after not watching it for a long time.  I was telling me teen son about it after watching SelfLess (Ryan Reynolds) as certain plot points had similarities and I was reminded how much I loved this flick.  Limitless is a very cool movie with Bradley Cooper as the main protagonist.  In it, he portrays a writer suffering from writer's block, and who is being dumped by his long-term girlfriend (Cornish) after she basically tells him he's a broke bum who isn't going anywhere in life.  After a chance meeting with his ex brother-in-law, he comes to learn of a new pharmaceutical drug known for ""performance enhancement,"" and decides to try it out.  It works, oh boy does it work!  And the drug makes him ""limitless.""

Cooper's mind begins rapidly expanding, and it is then he meets DeNiro's character; a big-wig, money thumper.  The dialogue between these two becomes rather funny towards the end.  I can't say much about the inbetween without giving too much away.

This is a very interesting concept, especially as it teeters on the borderline of inappropriate drug use vs appropriate drug use and benefit vs detriment; but also it's really fun to see how amazing the brain opens up when Cooper is using.

To have your brain be your superpower is awesome.  Typical Hollywood script, high point, conflict, resolved, high point, conflict, resolved, repeat as ending is is formulaic, but till works.  The film is not too long which is nice.

Of course, the film makes you want this drug and there is a drug that people are touting does this to some degree.  I wouldn't recommend it that actual pill, but I would recommend this movie.  I don't think you would be disappointed.",1467763200,,653,4.75

4523837,5,B0051MKMNC,Great movie. Cooper and DeNiro really worked it.,1455321600,,48,5.125
4523838,3,B0051MKMNC,"I saw the theatrical release on DVD. It was...okay. As many have said, the visuals were very good, and I thought that Bradley Cooper and Abbie Cornish (she played Cooper's girlfriend) were very good. In particular, I thought Cooper did a great job of getting across the character's dichotomous mental states, though I had a hard time empathizing with him. DeNiro and the Russian mobster weren't awful, but they were very cookie-cutter.

I actually didn't have a problem with Cooper being as selfish as he was. That can be just as interesting and compelling as a more moral character. But here, that selfishness is just bland. There's nothing terribly interesting about it. Another thing that made it difficult for me to get behind his character was that the suspense, which largely pivoted around whether or not he'd get more pills in time to stave off a crash, wasn't that convincing. I wasn't worried enough for him to worry about what'd happen to him if he crashed. The movie never made me doubt enough that he'd be able to get his fix. I'm honestly not sure what it was, but I just couldn't get behind his character enough to really become invested in what happened to him. Maybe it was because, even though we're told and shown many things about his ups and downs in the beginning of the movie as he's trying out the pills, I never felt any of it. It didn't make that kind of connection with me. His meteoric rise just felt so stakes-less. He's on top of the world, but the movie never got me to care about that. In contrast, even though I wasn't very invested in her character either, that one suspenseful sequence with Cornish had me genuinely worried about what would happen to her.

I also didn't have a problem with the movie being based off of the ""10% of the brain"" myth. This is fiction. It's a bit of a silly idea, but if people want to have fun with it I'm more than happy to see where they take it.

I think my favorite thing about the movie is actually something it didn't do, which is where the comparison to 'Lucy' comes into play. People are not robots. Our defining trait is not logic (proof: computers have logic in spades, and are infinitely more capable at it than humans are). ""Objectivity"" isn't the pinnacle of humanity. It really aggravated me when, in Lucy, as Johansson's character became more intelligent and accessed more of her brain, she became more robotic and expressed less emotion. You want to know what happens when people really start functioning based solely on logic and reasoning? We can't make decisions. We take EVERYTHING into account. We consider every last bit of unimportant minutiae. There have been studies in the field of psychology that demonstrate this very clearly. It turns out that our ""reasoning"" is based in emotion. Digression aside, I really liked that 'Limitless' made it all about what the characters, and Cooper's character specifically, wanted subjectively. The problem was that it didn't get me to care about what he wanted.",1455235200,,2990,4.702290076335878

4523871,5,B0051MKMNC,"The cinematic ""suspend reality"" is really reinforced in the opening sequence. It foreshadows the coming thrill ride.  The ""Limitless"" is an amplification of who you are...a zen, in that the amplifier is only as good as what is amplified.  No spoilers for this movie thats been out for years and the new TV Series, except that I respect what Bradley Cooper is trying to do...exaggerate what success as a metaphor is in life.  The director chose a thrill ride. It could have been an introspective movie as well.

""Limitless"" thrills with excess, like many movies do (Wall Street-Gatsby-Ironman) indulging in teenage fantasies of irresponsibility, fast cars, fast women and being irresistible.  Until  a moment of consciousness and desperation, our hero indulges in the one drug, ""success and power"" with all the while managing to barely escape a sequence of near death situations.

A one star review synopsized it this way: ""Five-word synopsis: Drug brings man material success.""  But wait.  Robert DeNiro's character (sounding like a Boomer talking to a Millennial), warns that fast success comes without the depth of earning it. Its said in a threatening way, yet enemies are often the best teachers. Then the plot point happens as the love of the right woman causes a moment of clarity and mindfulness. That's the hidden beauty of this gem.  Anyone can evolve. Maybe there is hope.  Watch it and think not of Bradely Cooper as the actor, think of him as the Producer...",1453507200,2,1470,4.983606557377049

4523888,4,B0051MKMNC,"Aimless writer takes magic pill, brain fires up completely and life is set, well... until you forget to pay your Russian loan shark.

I like this movie- watched it several times. It's an escapist fantasy, no doubt: swallow a truly magic pill and problems are solved with sheer previously untapped brain power. And what does our character seek with all that power? Money, sex, more power. It's a fun little ride to watch, though there are a few things to ignore less they completely spoil the ride or even ruin the movie experience.

For example, he forgets to pay his loan shark. Of course, as an author you need some kind of device to keep the action moving but 'forgetfulness' after you've established that the protagonist doesn't only 'not forget' anything, he can remember the most obscure details that seemed barely glanced in passing. The loan shark is perfectly brutal and believable. As long as you tell yourself, 'even someone with a four digit IQ can forget the details in a haze of it all', you'll be alright.

Second, he's smart but he doesn't sound like it. His language is not too far removed from a common street hustler and sometimes it's really difficult to get past. Intelligent people use the right words with efficiency and economy- but I don't have a four digit IQ (whatever that means) so I have to accept that 'bling' and other less descriptive words just haven't reached my puny brain.

Third, his career choice: politics. I'm a relatively liberal person but I have a hard time seeing politics as the best way to solve the world's problems, if that's where the protagonist was heading (again, it could be part of his larger plan my brain could never understand). We'll assume he's wealthy, we know he's smart, but at the end of the day anyone can tell you those with absurd wealth (e.g. Gates, Musk, Walton, etc.) have the power to make the large changes in the world- not the president. It was a let down.

Fourth, his mockery of art. He learns foreign languages in no time, piano in four days, etc. I'm guessing because those are the 'soft' mental areas. In all honesty, it's strange to claim one might 'learn piano' in four days, because it's a creative endeavor and creation/expression never really stops. The same goes with foreign languages- one might gain some fluency but economic and beautiful expression... truly subjective and far from measurable. Somehow I don't think a Berlitz course, no matter how advanced, will make you the Goethe of Deutch or the Mark Twain of English- know what I mean?

Fifth, I didn't like the female lead (not that she led much, women were kind of tokenized in this). Perhaps it was her blonde hair. I mean, I'm happy the two ended up back together, but still, she just didn't appeal to me. Hey Hollywood- why don't you screen actresses past me first so that I can always be happy with the actors and actresses?

Heheheheh.

OK, onto the good stuff.

I was happy he outsmarted DeNiro's character. DeNiro plays a self-absorbed 'power-broker' (literally and figuratively) well and it's nice to see his comeuppance in the form of Bradley Cooper tenderly diagnosing his heart problem the way Spock tenderly knocks people out with the Vulcan death grip.

I was happy the other NZT guy's bodygaurd didn't kill Cooper's character- especially after his girlfriend slashed his face with an ice skating shoe. I guess he figured a big scar shows character and all's forgiven or something or other.

I liked that Cooper slept with his landlord's wife. She was really uptight about law school and needed to sleep it off.

I liked the way Cooper handled those thugs in the NY Subway- like when he grabbed into that guy's mouth; I've never thought of that. I mean, I don't get into subway fights all the time, nor do I watch martial arts shows so it probably wouldn't have come to me, but really, thumbs in the mouth... that had to terrify that big guy- Cooper deserved to win it.

I liked that he dove off a cliff without killing himself. It happened early on so that would have made a very short movie.

I liked that he drove someone else's Maserati around the island like a maniac. That's what they get for letting someone else drive their Maserati and that's what the island gets for letting Maserati's on it rather than forcing everyone to take a taxi or walk. Seriously, he's practically terrorizing that island. The guy who owns that car and the fancy house is totally going to an island prison cell. I'm guessing the car belongs to a dad who's really rich and his son is crazy spoiled so the son's always getting him in trouble like that, but this time the son's probably going to get in very hot water. There's a separate movie/spinoff waiting to happen (just send the actresses to me first for pre-screening so we don't end up with that blonde).

I liked Bradley Cooper's suit(s).

I liked that the brother in law got shot in the head. He wasn't doing anyone any good, though he did give Cooper the pill for free so perhaps there was hope but I didn't have the patience to find out.

I liked that the Russian loan shark discovered Google. If he had lived, it could have really helped him find stuff.

I liked that Cooper didn't go to jail (again) for the Russian guy's killing the neighbors, shooting up the place and leaving a bloody mess. I mean, was it really his fault?

I liked that Cooper finished the book fast (a lot of weight off his shoulder right there).

I liked that he was able to make the Chinese waiter laugh. Shows he has a versatile sense of humor in different languages.

4523942,3,B0051MKMNC,"I wanted more from this movie.  The premise is intriguing if well trodden, ""what if you had access to 100% of your brain"".
And at first it is fun imagining what it would be like to be a great day trader, the standard ""lottery winner"" fantasies, but that gets old very fast.  Instead of exploring what you could do with that intelligence, the movie devolves into drug-deals-gone-bad, drug induced black outs, being smart gets you lots of sex, and my favorite: the magic ""writers block"" fix.

This appears as if it was written by a recovering drug addict hoping that all ills could be cured with another drug.  A Scarface who wins?

The visuals, if overdone, were woven into the story well. The colors are all brighter when Bradley Cooper is on the drug than when he is off.  The viewer feels disoriented when Bradley is, and sharper when he is, too.

Ultimately what doesn't work for me is that if he is so smart why is he constantly doing stupid things?

SPOILERS

First off, he has $800 he turns into $4000 in one day.  He says ""this isn't going fast enough, I need money but no one loans money to a guy like me"".
So, duh, off to the loan shark, who is known for _flaying_ his clients, for a $100,000 loan!
Loan shark says ""why should I loan you the money?""  Bradley says ""because I can increase my money 4x every day"".
Hmm, let me see.  $4000 x 4 x 4 x 4 is $128,000.  He can't wait 3 days to avoid being flayed at the end of the movie?
Then, Mr millionaire *forgets to pay back the loan shark*.  sigh.

This is a central plot point throughout the movie, too.  Take more pills Bradley!

Second, his girlfriend in order to escape bad guy uses the drug to calculate that she can grab a little girl on ice skates, swing her around, and cut the bad guys face.
Good job ruining that kids life.

Third, oh why bother.  In the end we cut to a ""12 months later"" and everything is tied up.

So many dropped story lines.
* What happened to his girlfriend (who at least wised up that he was a drug addict and dumped him).
* What happened to the woman he murdered (or was framed, we don't know it was just dropped).
* What happened to his ex-wife who turned into a meth-head after taking the drug.  Did he cure her?

I think we're supposed to like Bradley, but in the end he just acts like Scarface throughout, so... yay he's a Senator at the end?

Anyway.  It's decent fantasy for an hour and a half, but ultimately unsatisfying.",1448668800,2,2420,4.268131868131868

If the TV series is your basis for watching this movie .... do yourself a favor ...DON'T.
The two are only related by title and the pill it uses as it's primary prompt.
The actors and most characters are different too.  The quality of the acting is inferior to the TV series as well.",1447459200,,396,4.28

The transformation that the character makes throughout the movie was facinating and Bradley Cooper does a great job of being talented enough to play a serious character that is capable of being genuinely humorous.

You sometimes have to wonder if something like NZT does exist in a world like today, but for now I'm perfectly happy watching this movie as the fiction that it is. The movie has a good blend of action and comedy and will keep you on your seat.",1447459200,,531,4.418367346938775

4524029,4,B0051MKMNC,"I'd give it 4 and half, if that was possible. This is the movie that launched the series currently showing on TV (at the time of this post). I believe, that while the series may not last, the movie will. As science fiction piece, it plays upon a believable premise of chemical/medicinal advances that are a mix of conceivable and the rhetoric of the modern day snake oils promising physical stature, weight loss, enhanced sexual ability and, of course, accessing the unused potential of our minds.

Writers, stock investors, financiers and pharmaceutic personnel may enjoy this, especially. Not to mention that its fast pace, corporate conspiracy and drug addiction topics bring this close to home for many, today.

I think this movie's characters are well written and acted. Bradley Cooper plays the hero wonderfully and Robert De Niro reminds us why he is a revered actor.",1445990400,,874,4.97945205479452

4524130,5,B0051MKMNC,One of my favorites! Super fantasy movie about anything is possible and being on your toes! It really showcased Bradley Cooper and it was awesome to see Robert De Niro in such an old school De Niro type role! I saw this toward the end of its initial release in a fancy theater with reclining seats where they bring you food and I felt like I had gone on a weeks vacation when I left the theater!

4524149,5,B0051MKMNC,"This new series on television will be one of the big hits of the 2015/2016 season.  Interesting and novel premise and although Bradley Cooper was the main star in this two-hour movie, the hour-long television series has him in a supporting role and another actor performing the action feats (at least in the first show of the season.)  This series will be for people who enjoy ""Person of Interest"", ""Nikita"" starring Pita Wilson, and other action shows such as ""24"".  I originally bought this DVD because Bradley Cooper starred in it and I was not disappointed--it's a great new series on television and IMO will run for multiple seasons as long as the writing continues to be as good as it is starting out.",1443398400,,707,4.685483870967742

4524162,3,B0051MKMNC,I liked the pilot of the first tv show better. The movie lacked depth...too much action and not enough meaning. Bradley Coppers character started early in the movie implying he knew what his purpose was in finding NZT...unfortunately the viewer never got to see what that purpose was other than to make a movie with a lot of fast paced meaningless action.,1443139200,,355,4.741935483870968

They are of a similar concept but quite different, this isn't just a male version of Lucy.

Finishes book, works the stock market making lots of money. Offered job by financial legend (Robert De Niro) and chased by Russian mafia and other faceless foes.
Acting is very good and the effects his enhanced character and effects of the drug wearing off are very well portrayed.

4524181,3,B0051MKMNC,"Whenever I rate a movie, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to rate the movie itself, or just the packaging and physical media itself.  Since, you can go to any movie review site and read any of hundreds of reviews you want anyway.
But I'm going to rate the movie itself this time, because I was let down.  The gimmicky camera-work of walking into the scene faster and faster and faster got old fast.  It actually gave my wife a headache.  And as much as I like Bradley Cooper, there was nothing here that clicked for me and made me feel anything for his situation.  The video quality and audio themselves were great.  But the movie itself was a let-down.
Is this pure opinion?  Of course.  But I think the movie dragged in places it shouldn't, and then sped up at points where more character development could have happened.  Simply not a movie I plan on watching again.",1443139200,,865,4.424050632911392

Bradly Cooper is a pleasure to look at, so whatever weaknesses there were in the movie, he and his superb acting skills more than made up for it. I couldn't believe Robert Deniro was in it! He seemed a little big fish in little pond, but he brought his A game, anyway.

Bradley Cooper has just the right combination of the 'Everyman' morphing into pure intellectual power with the help of a mysterious designer drug. Abby Cornish and Robert DeNiro provide superb performances; with Mr DeNero in particular providing an understated, yet compelling role as a business tycoon.  Cooper's transformation from a slacker copywriter into super investment analyst show the full range of his actor's range, while demonstrating the vulnerabilities and missteps of Eddie Spinaola a ""regular guy"", reeling from the intense pressure of his transformation.

While the screenplay deviates from the novel, it retains much of the intense pace and hyper realism of the original.  Do not miss this one!",1440979200,,770,5.508474576271187

4524452,1,B0051MKMNC,"An increasing theme in TV shows these days is the ""smart thinking outside the box"" detective, public servant, or whoever... who blows away audiences with their powers of observation, deduction and abductive reasoning.  It seems that to enjoy this movie, you absolutely must have missed out on the last decade of interesting shows that use this premise.

The reason is that Bradley Cooper's character is really not very smart at all.  Then simultaneously he is doing impossible things (I won't name them here, no spoilers in this review).  This mashup between incredibly dumb decisions and impossible superhero achievements makes the movie altogether unenjoyable.  It doesn't help that the idea of the human brain being mostly untapped was scientifically discredited decades ago.

The main plot of this movie hangs on the premise that he borrowed money, proceeded to make 500% gains per day, but either couldn't remember to pay off his loan or couldn't figure out how to liquidate some of his positions to pay off the loan...  exactly why he couldn't achieve this simple task is never explained.

The icing on the cake is that Bradley Cooper's character is a real ""jerk"" (a stronger adjective would be more appropriate).  His character is not likable... for example, he's constantly and thoroughly selfish from the beginning to the end of this movie. No lessons learned, other than that finding shortcuts in life are fun and let you take selfishness to a whole new level. Yay.

I'm baffled by the reviews for this movie. There is nothing redeeming here.",1429747200,9,1552,5.02734375

4524509,4,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" has all the compelling drama and immersive storyline of any of the recent big budget scifi blockbusters, and does it with about a thousandth of the special effects. The effect of the tech on human lives is at the core of all the best scifi, and this movie minimizes the scifi and maximizes the story of Morra's (Bradley Cooper) awakening. There have been a few movies made about the double-edged sword that high IQ can be (Little Man Tate, A Beautiful Mind, Charly, and even Back ToThe Future) and ' Limitless' seems to borrow from them all. Morra can see patterns in data on a computer monitor that his mind is adding to it, and sometimes the data he's juggling in his head seems to be projected on the walls of the room he's in. Similar to the plot of 'Charly', the increased intelligence can go away, also, but in this film, when Morra slides back to his mundane (but reasonably intelligent yet self-sabotaging} mind, it is portrayed as leaving him in situations he embarrassingly no longer understands, rather than a heartrending return to relative darkness. After all, he could get back in the cockpit thirty seconds after taking another pill, and that's just the inefficient, slow digestive method, as he comes to find out.
DeNiro plays a very bright and deeply savvy Wall St entrepeneur, and plays it convincingly. I've been slowly getting over my automatic expectation that, whenever he smiles, he's about to personally blow someone's kneecaps off, but in this film he uses his skills to instill fear as only a hardened, crooked multi-millionaire can. De Niro danger is there, but he's also very cunning.
The film leaves a few questions open at the end, which would fit nicely with a sequel, but IMHO maybe the rest of this story should be left up to our imaginations. If a sequel got made, I wouldn't be able to stay away, though. Something about watching a regular guy learning to control his new ""4 digit IQ"" is very addictive, and we should all perhaps feel lucky that, like with Jim Carrey in ' The Mask ', it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.",1426377600,9,2073,4.666666666666667

In other words, it tells that story and does so straightforwardly, from A to Z.  It uses that same movie making formula which back in the 20th Century led to American cinema being considered far and away the best in the world!  I hope it serves now to open the eyes of all these so called ""Hollywood movie makers"".

 This uneven film starts from a very promising premise.  What would happen to a person if he suddenly became able to use every twisty corner of his brain instead of just the parts we can get to on a day to day basis?  What if every single thing we have ever seen, heard, read or experienced became as accessible to us as what we had for breakfast?  And what would happen if we could read and organize information at a super rapid rate?  Well, we should be able to do well in the field of high finance, dating and very importantly, avoiding bad guys who want to take advantage of our new talent.
 Bradley Cooper plays a failing writer who is given a new drug which accelerates his mental acuity to a fantastic degree.  In the course of the film he becomes wealthy and successful with women.  He manages to defeat his several opponents, commit murder most foul and eventually to become a well adjusted, super smart, nice guy.  It is an entertaining ride and Cooper does the role the justice that it deserves.  The spectacularly beautiful Abbie Cornish plays his on again/off again girlfriend in a decidedly supporting role.
 Director Neil Burger turns out to have a dab hand with the camera.  The best parts of the movie are really made possible because of his directorial skill, rather than by the fine acting jobs done by his cast.  The cast includes movie icon Robert De Niro in a terrific role as the financier that we love to hate.  This is his most interesting role in years and De Niro takes advantage of the opportunity to play to his strengths.
 If I was to order a re-write of the script, I would have left out the part where the hero, in a frenzy induced by the designer smart drug, kills a young socialite.  He is so smart that he escapes his justice, but after that it makes it hard to root for the guy when everything closes in on him.
 In the 1995 film Phenomenon John Travolta plays another ordinary guy who suddenly becomes super smart.  In his film, he becomes wise as well as smart.  I find the earlier film to be much the more satisfying.  The protagonist in Limitless becomes wise by the end of the film, but it is too late for me to care.  The dead socialite spoils the wine.
 This well directed, finely acted PG-13 (drug use, lots of violence) film made $19 million in its opening weekend, a good way to making back the seemingly small $27 million budget.  I would like to award this entertaining action/thriller more than an average three saw blades, but I just cant.  It runs a bit low at one hour and 45 minutes.  Clipping out the dead socialite bit would have only taken another two or three minutes.",1424044800,,2635,4.428274428274428

4524569,4,B0051MKMNC,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 Stars, Spoiler Alert] Bradley Cooper plays ""Eddie Morra,"" a writer with major writer's block and little going for him, whose life goes into overdrive (in questionably positive ways) after taking a mystery pill given to him by his ex-brother-in-law (and drug dealer), who says it taps into every nook and cranny of your brain's potential (he said more than the usual 20%, but I, seriously, always thought it was 2%).  But someone ""takes care of"" his ex-brother-in-law, making Eddie believe this is the most powerful drug on the synthetic market.  Soon, Eddie starts running low and the side effects kick in, with previous users dying or already dead, except his ex-wife, who says it's possible to wean off the synthetic drug if done vigilantly.  But then Eddie seems to think that he's found the right balance to take it indefinitely, which is especially tempting since his work colleague/supervisor (Robert DeNiro) says that he can just whip it up in a lab, now having the resources.  Can Eddie resist, or will he take the high road?  Entertaining and well done all around (and, I'd say, a favorite, as a drug endorsement, of profit-seeking pharmaceutical companies and over-prescribing healthcare providers), but what values are being taught here? Say yes to drugs because Hollywood pretty-boy Cooper is scarfing them down in a cool movie? Synthetic drugs (and street drugs) will solve all your problems because you have no other choice, and you can safely rely on them?

This movie could have really contributed much to the investigation of what is the nature of intelligence. You will notice in the movie, and I recommend it as it is a good movie, that the basic premise of the ability gained by the protagonist was the ability to first observe, evaluate information and estimate the situation to arrive at the correct action to resolve the situation. That is the primary sequence used throughout the movie. And it is a true sequence. This could have led to a different story rather than one of fleeing from gangsters and conflict with another man (Robert DeNiro) which ended in a petty one-upmanship with the protagonist, Cooper, winning.

For clarity, all those one star reviews are mostly from people that just can't comprehend that the review portion of Amazon is to actually review the movie, not to rant about delivery problems or non working discs. So overall, there is a strong agreement that ""Limitless"" is a solid film.

If you don't know the premise ( but I think you do ), I'm sorry, I won't be writing about it but will be sticking to highlighting the amazing plot. ""Limitless"" uses every formula that has ever worked in films to the hilt and encapsulates them into one intelligent film. Bradley Cooper nails every scene as he shows us how what we mentally desire is as initially rewarding as we thought. He displays all the facial ticks necessary to reveal the switch from cerebrally dull to super sharp. I think the story taps into the walking doldrums that many people have. Lying dormant in a good number of us is that book or screenplay screaming to get out. We see in the film what could play out if (as Coppers character Eddie Morra says) we could remove all of the shyness and awkwardness that can be part of being human. In doing so , the film accurately depicts the desperate desires anyone with such proclivities would do to attain a drug to fix it all immediately. All the little things we've picked up in life from PBS shows to Kung Fu movies being utalized to the extreme is ultra fascinating. And that's what this movie is, the incredibly fascinating journey of a man.

This is also Deniro's best role in quite awhile. He envelops the ""seeing through it all"" persona to the point that it makes even the super smart Eddie Morra nervous. It takes time for Morra to inhabit his drug fueled life to the point where he can deal with Deniro equally . A very real scenario with a fictional drug. Morra's ""hangovers"" are deliciously played as they invoke such desperate feelings of what was had and lost that it is universally relatable.

The sensual Abbie Cornish plays Morra's girlfriend  Lindy and is believable as she questions the drug. Her experience imbibing it made total sense under duress . As an action film, ""Limitless"" never disappoints with cutting edge stunts. You really get a totally exciting cinematic experience with this film. A portion of the ending could have been stronger but if you mentally use ambiguity to compensate, it can be overlooked because the film is otherwise very strong.

Definitely one of my new top ten films.",1418601600,,2447,4.64203233256351

4524659,5,B0051MKMNC,"I have to admit that the inspiration I just wrote was the last thing I would expect to happen when I  purchased this limitless (starring Bradley cooper) dvd at my walmart job for just five dollars back around September 2014. After all, my husband and I enjoyed watching limitless together when we saw it in movie theaters in 2011 and were both drawn to the idea of the possibilities that could be unleashed if a person can increase their intelligence/genius by just taking a pill. I was mainly looking to explore that possibility again when I purchased this limitless dvd,but something just clicked in me in the scene when he accomplishes the feat of writing his novel. There have also been a series of positive incidences that have also gave me a reminder on how seeking out wisdom and  striving for the greatness of genius have been discussed; a natalie portman articIe online where she acknowledged the importance of intellectual growth (I intend to update this review later with one of the articles because Im aware she is widely known for both her brains and beauty), coming across a book at my job where a woman realized that her beauty can only carry her so far and that her greater focus must be on wisdom,  a local news article discussing benedict cumberbatchs role in the imitation game, and a yahoo news connection on chris hemsworth starring in an upcoming movie based on someone known for their genius). However, I wish to avoid saying more on it and to just at least acknowledge that this movie limitless and the actors (Bradley cooper)portrayal inspired me to pursue a side writing career ( a new years resolution).  Bradley cooper stars as the character of eddie morra, whose life turns 180 degree turn for the better when he is given a pill that expands his potential. Morra ends up attacting  the wealth and love that he craves. However, he meets gets his life turned upside down by another powerful and wealth man named Carl Van loon (Robert DeNiro) who would like to exploit his abilities at morras expense.

4524664,2,B0051MKMNC,"This film is the 'Benjamin Buttons' of drug addition. Effectively, it attempts to turn drug addiction inside out by postulating a new 'designer drug' that not only increases your brainpower, but can actually help you get ahead in the world... unlike real drugs like Meth or Cocaine that rot you tend to rob the user's life and money. Thus, this initially makes you think this might actually be an uplifting tale. While this idea of taking a pill that unlocks your brain potential seems like a really cool premise, the writers couldn't avoid taking it to the inevitable place as a banal cautionary tale of drug addiction. I mean, why bother with that social commentary at all? It's easy to flip on Amazon instant video and pull up many documentaries about drug addiction, why spend the money on entertainment only to get this same message shoved into your face?

No, the writers should have steered clear of this commentary in Limitless. While it would have been okay for Bradley's character to find out what happens if you quit the drug cold turkey, it would have been simple enough to make sure he had plenty on hand so that didn't happen. In fact, after learning of his newfound brain skills, his first task would have been to reverse engineer the drug so he could make more and have an infinite supply right from the go. Instead, the movie fails as he focuses on mergers and acquisitions, becoming a drug dealer and dealing with people who get upset when they don't get their next fix. This is not a particularly brilliant plot point. Knowing he had a limited supply of these pills and no source to get more, he would have certainly explored having more made as the first thing he does, not something he does 3/4 of the way through the film's plot. Unfortunately, by this point in the film, it's more than apparent that the story has degraded into a cheesy tale of drug addiction on Wall Street.

When I first read the synopsis for this film and its relatively high marks here on Amazon, I thought I would take a chance. Unfortunately, this is not a film I will watch more than once. I'm not sure what it is about all of the high ratings this film is seeing on Amazon. Sure, the cinematography and time dilation effects are interesting, but they're nothing without a brilliant story.

4524679,2,B0051MKMNC,"This is a review of the Digital copy, not the movie. We always get the digital copy pack whenever possible, it is just easier than having our disks get scattered about the house if kids want to watch a movie or worse get lost because somebody borrows one. It is always an easy process, open the packaging get the code, go online and add it to our library on Amazon, Vudu, Disney ...... whichever service.
 NOT WITH THIS MOVIE,  THE ""DIGITAL COPY "" is a separate disk which needs to be loaded into a computer ( isn't a physical disk a contradiction of ""digital copy"" to begin with ) then you are supposed to enter your code to transfer it to your HDD in Itunes or WMV format. ( Hello, if I wanted to just rip the disk onto my HDD, I would not need to bother paying extra to get the disk and digital copy)
 So first I try the WM option and first get a pop up saying I need to install some sync app, but when I click the link it opens a window to buy a windows phone. Yes I am insane, because I clicked the box at least 3-4 times somehow expecting a different result. So then I just close that popup and click transfer, this time I get a popup telling me I need to upgrade windows media security protocol ,okay I click and windows update opens ,scans then tells me I have the latest version and no further updates are available. Okay lets try this again and once again I somehow expected a different result ,yet got the same results from the same actions. Clicking the "" help"" link brings you to the Fox online store so you can buy another copy. I am not sure why if I already own a copy the Help to watch it is to buy another copy.
Okay I give up on Windows media and decide to go with the Itunes option. So I exit back to the disk main menu and click Itunes ( Yes we have an Itunes account even though we never use the service, I am reminded daily when it pops up telling me it needs to be updated, I think it is the only software that needs to be updated more than Adobe ) So Itunes opens and logs in and starts syncing all the new music etc on the computer . It gets done syncing and I click the disk menu and surprise surprise "" error please try again later"" , so once again just to prove I am insane I try this 3-4 times as well consistently expecting a different result.
At this point it has been almost an hour wasted trying to access this digital copy and I realize I could have already watch the movie and been onto the bonus material.
Amazon needs to get their licensing straightened out, so when I buy a movie with digital copy it is automatically added to my Amazon library and no more of this BS free 2 day rental while you wait for the disk to arrive, especially when the digital copy included with the disk is useless.",1417564800,5,2731,4.081936685288641

The premise of the film was interesting. Too bad though that the plot is convoluted for it was full of impossibilities and implausibilities. Added to that,it was also uneven with a lot of inconsistencies in terms of the character and the story. But despite of the negative things I have mentioned,it still manages to be appealing and entertaining. Credit Bradley Cooper for his portrayal as Eddie. Finally,it subtly becomes a cautionary tale for drug addiction despite the fact that the results it presents in the film are positive things such as maximizing the utilization of the brain and achieving progress in life.",1412121600,2,777,4.984615384615385

4524761,4,B0051MKMNC,"While I know this is not a great movie, I really like it. As a working writer, I can identify with Bradley Cooper's character, Eddie, the struggling novelist on the brink of total failure. Who of us has not wished for a magic pill like this while wrestling with ""creative issues?"" Watching the ramifications of his new-found brilliance play out is kind of like wish fulfillment -- great fun, even if the plot specifics are a little muddy from time to time. The off-kilter camera work matches the giddy, heightened-reality feeling when Eddie is under the influence, helping to push it all along at near-warp speed so we don't have time to think about it. Robert DeNiro may have been miscast as the billionaire tycoon mentor/potential nemesis, but he finds a way to make it work. Abby Cornish is great as Eddie's girlfriend. This could have been a thankless role, but she plays it smart and strong. The Russian mobsters are a bit of a clich, but so what. They're perfect for a quasi-fantasy like this one. All in all, good, entertaining fun.",1410307200,2,1039,4.683060109289618

Super entertaining, fascinating premise, inspiring. Bradley Cooper is outstanding; cast works with him flawlessly. The only slight discordance is Robert DeNiro, who I love as much as everyone else, but he's was just too well-know and played the part in his iconic acting style, not a fresh, original performance, as the other actors managed to achieve.

4524826,4,B0051MKMNC,"Acting was well done. Sort of a waste of Robert DeNiro though.

Essentially, this writer with what appears to be issues with self-esteem, lack of will power, difficulty concentrating, cleanliness; is going downhill rapidly. He owes money to everyone. He can't get a chapter written much less the book. His girlfriend tells him she is no longer to be his paycheck, house-cleaner, cook... and leaves.

He is lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut, when he runs into his ex-brother-in-law, a former drug dealer, who says he has cleaned up his act and now sells pharmaceuticals for a company, and is doing very well.  He, sees what a mess our hero is in and offers him ONE pill of a new drug, which he says will make him feel and think better than he has ever done in his life. This pill normally costs $800 a pop, and has not yet been released, though FDA approved. (Don't know why the hero thought FDA approval made it safe....) The ex-brother-in-law gets a call and has to run off, right as our hero is saying he doesn't want the pill, which is left behind with him anyway.

Well on the way home, hero...who is depressed, thinks what the hey and takes the miracle drug.  The guy goes into overdrive, cleaning up his apartment and writing that first chapter that will get him his advance from his literary agent.  He goes to the agent, and is still hyper and tells her, with her EXTREMELY doubtful...because she has been dealing with this jerk for a while, that after she has read a few paragraphs IF she doesn't want the piece, he will bring back her advance; to call him later that night.

He goes home and has three messages. The first is from the agent, she says she has read a few pages and she likes them, but does not yet know if he is going to be able to sustain his style through the whole piece. The next message from her also...she has read a few more pages, and she is excited and thinks he has a good concept and potentially valuable piece. The final message is from his heavy breathing, excited agent who is kissing up to him big time...and he knows he has her, the contract and the opportunity to make some good money to live on. He goes looking for his brother-in-law to get more pills.

He goes to the apartment where his brother-in-law lives...door is open...he goes in...apartment torn up...he sees his brother in law sitting on the sofa, back to him...he goes to see him and the guy's brains are blown out...and from there this fantasy becomes a thriller with a twist at the end.

The interest, the action, the compression of the film stays good right up till the end...AND a viable end IS obtained, BUT I gave it 4 stars because it needed a little more development at the end to have made the denouement work better. Still a very enjoyable thriller.",1405814400,2,2771,4.438976377952756

The plot was very good, and I only wanted to see the movie because De Niro was casted.

Use is one thing abuse is another...Watch and see how the main character Cooper figures this out.  Once the neuro-connections are established...one truly reprogram.  It takes awareness, acceptance, willingness and an acute diligence to do the work to make things happen by creating a new awareness. With a new reprogrammed awareness your life becomes in incredible sequence of synchronicities, but you must pay attention so you can notice them.",1402531200,,659,5.19811320754717
4524859,4,B0051MKMNC,"Some people say that we're all addicted to one thing or another, it's just a bit more obvious in some people as to what they're addicted to.  Agree or disagree but it does seem to be true that most people strive after some thing or another, whether it's gasps of air and life or it's wealth or love or whatever.  How we go about obtaining what we seek, whether we earn it by our own hands and the sweat of our brow or it drops into our laps via being in the right place at the right time seems to us an importance.  Not so much to Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), the protagonist of the film ""Limitless"", a failed writer and generally down on his luck bunko who can't seem to get things straight, until a miracle drug that unlocks the potential of his mind to absorb information through his physical faculties and to predict incredibly accurately near-future events.  It is, of course, too good to be true and the effects fade and so we follow what is essentially a junkie looking for his next fix throughout a film that sees him trying to keep ahead of the trouble that he's created in front of him.  There are some snazzy action pieces in this sci-fi lite plot premise but the film is mostly a character study, somewhat cerebral, and goes to lengths to baffle the audience at film's end as to whether or not Morra has conquered (controlled really) his demon in the form of a pill, a hit.  To this end he faces off against partner/ antagonist Carl van Loon (Robert DeNiro) who may be more like Morra than Morra knows.

The film could have gone longer into the drug addicted persona of its star but it goes far enough and it offers itself as a thriller more than a sci-fi action movie.  It is definitely a visceral experience at points but the thing that troubles me are the messages of the film (it is a good discussion piece for a movie if you're into that sort of thing): the pursuit of power and potential by artificial means are justified by the ends; the fairy tale element of the addict overcoming (?) their addiction through pharmaceuticals; the mundanity of life made better through drugs.  I will say, at least, that the film does not minimize the effects of addiction completely which is important.  I would imagine that those who have suffered serious and debilitating drug addictions versus those who haven't might view this film differently.  3.75 stars.",1402358400,,2365,4.502336448598131

4524871,5,B0051MKMNC,It's hard to find anything wrong with this movie. I loved the story.  It's both well directed and acted.  Scifi at its best.,1399680000,,124,4.3478260869565215
4524872,4,B0051MKMNC,I like sci-fi films and 'Limitless' fits into the genre as one that seems plausible or at least presents itself that way. The film features a great performance from Bradley Cooper with some help from resident acting guru Robert DeNiro. Interesting visuals give the film a fresh style and the quick pace makes for a story that is never boring. A unique film that blurs the lines between drug addiction and useful medicine and makes us think if there are reasons to take a chance on such a dangerous gamble.,1399593600,,505,4.622222222222222
4524873,5,B0051MKMNC,One of my favorites.  This is a movie I can and have watched multiple times.  Great performances by Bradley Cooper and of course De Niro.,1399075200,,137,4.44

4524876,5,B0051MKMNC,"I love the way this movie illustrates increased intelligence through how quickly and comprehensively we perceive and analyze information.

4524887,3,B0051MKMNC,"I liked the basic idea and really enjoyed the first hour or so.  The ending was a disappointment and needlessly violent.  Also, I was a little fuzzy about some of the details in the movie.",1396828800,,188,4.3428571428571425
4524888,5,B0051MKMNC,Bradley Cooper is phenomenal as usual. Robert Deniro was as well! Very fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat.,1396742400,,117,4.130434782608695
4524889,5,B0051MKMNC,Nice job by Mr. Cooper and he has such range.  Seeing Mr. Di Nero play a sub role and doing it well is refreshing.,1396656000,,114,3.75
4524890,4,B0051MKMNC,"Very well done movie.

In the end, it does glorify drug usage to get what you want, which is an epic fail in moral content. As a parent I would allow my teenager (16+) to watch this ONLY after I explained the content and told them they would have to discuss the movie with me afterwards to tell me their thoughts on the morality.

Better to learn their perspective than have them mindlessly swallow Hollywood's lie.",1396656000,,415,4.447368421052632

I really liked this movie.

If you had a super bad day or week at work, do this....

Pop some popcorn...or get some great take out food....chips...munchies...anything...when you are all set for food and beverages...........
RENT THIS MOVIE....again...great movie all the way..but even better if you had a crappy day or week.

Anyway, rent this movie, and put yourself in Bradley Cooper's role....OMG...this movie was soooo therapeutic....

At the beginning I was ...just like...yep that's me...that's my life... my fiance totally dumped me...job problems.....just...just OMG....this!!

I don't want to spoil it too much...but remember...too much of a good thing can be abused...then roll back against you....well..guess what...this movie addresses the ..""too much of a good thing....""

Do yourself a favor...watch this movie....bad day or week...or not..... I just found it ""therapeutic"" for me because I had such a crappy year...anyway...

In days he's able to master the stock market, finish his novel and impress the hell out of his publisher and basically turn his life around....UNTIL he finds the dark side of NZT.

He finds himself pursued by a Russian mob loan shark, and an unscrupulous stock manipulator (Robert DeNiro) amidst the realization that all those who've previously taken NZT are dead or very ill.

HOWEVER, he finds there are some ""dues"" to be paid for all of this, but he will make you quite happy with his final endeavors... GREAT photographic zoom effects are definitely trippy...

I showed it to psychology students (after receiving permission of course) and it tied in with our consciousness unit (which followed the unit on the brain).

I found the story enjoyable though; a decent mix of action, mystery, and a refreshing plot. I don't want to give away to much of the movie, but basically the movie asks ""What could one man do if he had access to a drug that allowed him to use 100% of his mental capacity?""

He runs into his ex brother in law who gives him a drug that makes his iq skyrocket by having all the synapses fire and the ability to use more of his brain power. After he experiences it he goes back for more, but then the brother in law gets killed, he finds his stash, starts using it and becomes successful in business, genius writer, and great with the ladies. Then he starts experiencing side effects from the drug, realizes people are after him for his stash, and generally his whole world starts collapsing. By the end of the movie he weens himself off but still maintains some of the mental abilities. While the movie is unbelievable I enjoyed it because the scenes where he is on the drug is visceral and makes me live for a brief moment in that world. Ive done my share of drugs, and the idea of a new drug that can elevate my abilities, make me feel THAT good, and be THAT successful is basically the holy grail of what we all hope for when we do drugs. The ending is unbelievable because anyone whos done a modicum of illicit substances know that theirs no happy ending, especially since Eddie sees the effects on the drug on other people whos used it: death, premature aging, dementia. It doesnt make sense that he escapes those things when he was abusing it at a rate higher than the rest. They didn't give any explanation for why he does and being lucky isn't a good explanation.

4524927,4,B0051MKMNC,"Cool movie.
But it seems to me the drug gives him brain power and clarity on what to do how to do it towards his objectives, but not wisdom and STRATEGY.
Otherwise, he would not have messed with the bad guy, Liev, in the first place. Right?
Also, the CHOICE of where to go with the power has still nothing to do with the drug. It's not that he used his new power to fix any of the world's problems, he just went into the only direction of getting his own life better.",1392422400,,467,4.032258064516129

Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised to see what a solid job Bradley Cooper did considering his biggest films have all been some form of comedy. But this movie is well done with a storyline that's not to hard to follow even though there is a bit to be desired when it comes to the background info of the ""magical pill.""

Without a doubt, I paid less than $8 for this Blu-Ray and it showed up on time and without issue. It was a great purchase.",1391472000,2,596,4.219298245614035

But the whole concept and how it's demonstrated are the central core of the film and its integrity and style are upheld beautifully. It's a very exciting film that points to the limitless possibilities in all of us and the downside of using substances to get there. Highly recommend this film.,1391385600,,413,4.75

4524942,3,B0051MKMNC,"First, I think it is confusing in the sense that it seems that this movie is basically an advertisement for a pill (i.e.  [...] - which featured Bradley Cooper, which apparently is no longer functioning - and a real clear pill available at webnutrients.com  - so it left me wondering what was real and what wasn't and how there could be a situation where you could take a drug this powerful without going through a doctor, etc..  Apparently there are drugs like this that you can take..  So, I'm wondering what is real and what isn't real...  This is sold as a work of fiction, but it might not be.

Also it is confusing in that they have the ending of the movie and the alternative ending (which they should not have included) -  as it made you wonder if they really knew what they were doing when they made the movie.

It has lots of action and it is enjoyable to watch.  I really didn't like the golddigger - she dumps him at the first part of the movie because he's down on his luck, but then he starts taking the drugs and starts making the $$$ - then suddenly she is interested in dating him again.  I really disliked this character greatly - and honestly since she dumped him, he should have forgotten about her.

The movie really does a good job showing the dangers of taking a pill like this - but it does say that if you are one of these people who just can't pull it together then maybe there's a medication which could be an answer for you.  I would be one of these kind of people.

I honestly thought the guy at the first part of the movie was much more likeable than the one at the end.
To be honest.  It's almost like he sold his soul to the Devil.  What I didn't like about it is the false messages that money and power are good and being poor isn't good.  Dressing nice is good, not dressing nice isn't good, etc etc.  and you do whatever you need to do even if this drug hurts your body to get the money and the power and the women, even if you have people chasing you trying to kill you all the time - whatever the cost - it is worth it - when in truth it isn't worth it  I think the main character is a jerk.  But that's my opinion, which isn't worth much.

It is a good action movie.  I liked the parts with Mr Taxi Driver himself as I think he did a great job in the movie and he spoke much wisdom during the movie..  They could have finished the movie better than they did.",1391212800,,2396,4.0965665236051505
4524943,5,B0051MKMNC,"I love this movie, it really highlights the ups and downs of drug abuse to the ultimate of both ends.  With this new drug, you can literally do anything you can think or dream of, it opens and expands your mind and taps into that part of your brain that we supposedly never even use.  It's hard to see the downside of such a drug, at first.  Until our protagonist learns of long time users dying from addiction or even trying to stop.  When he tries to stop, he suffers first hand how sick he becomes and longs for another taste of the success the drug unleashes inside him.

Such an amazing film with great special effects, great actors, and great life lessons and realism on drugs.

(SPOILER ALERT) Alternate Ending
I was a bit disappointed, however, with the alternate ending this DVD version offered, it was anticlimactic in comparison to the original, which of course is why it was cut and they went with the original, but I just expected more, all the same.  I did enjoy the bit about finding a ""cure"" in the talk between Cooper and Pacino in that version, and wish they had worked that into the original ending, however I would have been happier had they actually worked that into the movie (the use of the drug's powers into his mind and him working into finding a cure to get off the drug) rather than just a conversation about such.

All the same, a brilliant movie about an amazing drug that wrecks lives in the end, Highly Recommended to watch!",1391126400,2,1456,4.447368421052632

4524948,2,B0051MKMNC,"A premise of an ""ultimate"" drug that temporarily increases your cognitive skills literally exponentially (OK, so they use that stupid idea to explain the drug that we don't use 80% of our brains simply because we, uh, just can't--one of the dumbest myths ever spoken since people started believing Einstein failed math when he had understood it better than almost anyone by the time he was 10 years old--as the official explanation, but it's given by the dealer himself as the explanation, so he gets a pass for just selling it), given to a run-down, poor writer? A predictable, though satisfying, initial course of what happens when the drug wears off, and one needs more to sustain that? A hint that the drug's been around a very long time, and past events were influenced by this not-too-unbelievable ""ultimate"" drug?

Just like the drug, sounds too good to be true, but you can't deny that everything is set up for something astonishing to happen.

Yet, it doesn't. Around the beginning of the second-half, all character, interesting plot, sub-plots, and thematic developments comes to a near-complete stop. Common sense starts going out the window in a series of odd events in which the main character, and everyone around him, starts to behave in ways that aren't consistent with the events of the first half. They simply disappear from the screen, and by anti-climax, it's pretty much *all* gone except the trailer.

It's almost poetic in how this film crashes harder than the not-even-close-to-outside-reality drug and the world on which it's based. It's impossible not to stop at some point during the film and start questioning what every single character is doing, which becomes increasingly more evident as the film's pages seem to stick together in places. All the stuff implicated about his past life being influenced by the drug beforehand? Once it's implicated, it's dropped. The romantic sub-plot? Gone after a point without any real explanation, and is never mentioned again. Even Robert De Niro's role, which starts off promising, takes an almost comedic backseat to astonishingly-implausible situations that lack basic movie coherence.

By the time the credits roll, the whole film has changed from something genuinely interesting, provocative, and potentially deep, into a lighthearted, carefree, comedic, drug-infused fantasy that has successfully baited-and-switched what you thought you were going to get the whole time, which is, well, some sort of half-satisfying conclusion. Well, we get what's technically a conclusion, and it doesn't conclude all that much, then literally skips some (if not most) of the somewhat important plot points that you're led to believe are going to *be* the focal point of the climax.

Instead, in place of an actual logical conclusion to the plot and the characters it's built up all this time, we get, uh, this screen:

""Twelve months later...""

And that's literally what happens right when you think the story needs to wind down. When the main character deals with the problems he's caused along with the successes he's created. They outright skip the part you've been anticipating was inevitable: The drop, the consequences, and the kind-of-significant things the character has inadvertently done to others as a result of his dependence, and even his whole life from then on. They cut to a year later, explain it in about two sentences with an absurd outro, and the credits roll, leaving every single answer to every meaningful question anyone could possibly have completely off-screen, with as little exposition as possible in as tight a time as possible.

It's like all of a sudden, during the filming phase, a giant buzzer went off indicating they were out of time, the budget *just* hit zero, and everyone involved in making the film says they've got that thing to go to.

The ""alternate ending"" provided is only marginally more sensible, but not even close to what one would at least consider courteously wrapping some things up, even if it skips a few minor details that aren't worth it (it happens). It's not exactly the original ""alternate"" or ""controversial"" endings to ""I Am Legend"", ""The Descent"", or ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"", all of which made the title of the film make sense (i.e., the title held all the original meaning in its climax), so don't expect anything like that.

The title of the film apparently means something totally different when they coin it again at the end, but it's definitely not a meaning you'd expect (much less want) from a film that set up so much beforehand.",1390521600,,4562,5.038461538461538

Bradley Cooper carries the movie -- he's in just about every scene of the film and we never grow bored with him.
The great Robert DeNiro comes across as savvy and wise, more of a mogul than a trader/investment banker type.
Abbie Cornish is interesting to watch as well: she's nearly as pretty as Charlize Theron and seems deep for her age.

Interesting score, part rising/charging, part poignant.

Leslie Dixon took a lot of liberties adapting the script from the novel ""The Dark Fields"" but her choices were mostly for the better.
Her early draft of the script is available online and was a bit truer to the book in that Eddie didn't get to have a happy ending.
In this version, Eddie appears on track to gaining unlimited financial and political power, but at the price of his soul.

Quick synopsis for you without giving away too much...  Bradly Cooper is a struggling writer with a lack of drive and focus who is floundering through life.  There is a new drug in development that he is introduced to by way of his ex-brother-in-law which unlocks the other 90% of the brain which is not used.  With this increased awareness the user can live without limits as they become hyper aware and able to access all information that they have previously been exposed to.  Unfortunately, there are some terrible and debilitating side-effects and no shortage of people who would kill to get their hands on this drug for themselves.

As this is presently under $10 (think I picked it up on super sale for $4), I think it's worth adding to your movie collection.  As someone who is working to move my movies into the cloud, I also picked this version up because it comes with a DigitalCopy code.  While I generally like both iTunes (we have AppleTV's) and UltraViolet (works via our BluRay streaming) codes, for whatever reason the Limitless code is what I can only describe as a handicapped digital version.

The reason being you redeem it via iTunes, but the code does NOT entitle you to download or stream the movie through iTunes.  There is also no digital backup available to you to re-download direct from iTunes should you have an issue with the computer you redeem the code on.  Of the 50+ movies I have redeemed via iTunes, this is the ONLY MOVIE that is limited in this regard.  I reached out to iTunes thinking it was bugged, but they referred me back to the publisher as they control the rights to the  movie.  As it stands, the only way to get this to a portable device is to direct sync it with iTunes and there is NO streaming possible via AppleTV.  I know, first world problems... but still, it is extremely annoying if you want to have your digital content be as portable as possible.",1388016000,6,2069,4.551351351351351

I would have liked the movie to have been longer to delve deeper into the idea and how others may corrupt it (touched on by the DeNiro character). But you can certainly see the potential for sequels, as long as they're serious and don't make them silly. As far as sequels go, you can also see this become a variation of the 'Bourne' series, where the conflicts & battles are intellectual chess games, rather than blood & guts brawls.

4525036,5,B0051MKMNC,"I've watched this over and over again. Who wouldn't want a four digit IQ? I know I would.

I saw what I considered to be a couple of plot anomalies though. One was that if he was doubling his money every day, he could have multiplied it by at least 1024 times in just ten more business days. If he was willing to wait for twenty more business days, he would have multiplied his money by 1048576 times. To me, that seems more than fast enough. If he was starting out with a few thousand dollars, he could easily have been a billionaire without borrowing any money from the greedy thug. Of course, that would have made the movie enormously different and not nearly as dramatic. He wouldn't have needed to have anything to do with Carl Van Loon either. And $40,000,000 after two months (42 or 43 business days) work? Aside from market reaction, he could have multiplied his money by approximately 7.9668296 * 10^12 times. Obviously, the writer's ideas on the mathematics of exponential growth left a lot to be desired.

I've known, admired, and envied some very intelligent people in my time, and I wished I could have thought of the same things they did. While I guessed that their IQ's were at least a couple of standard deviations higher than mine, I can scarcely imagine what a four digit IQ would be like. And that brings me to my next anomaly.

Assuming he got a five times (from 20% of his brain to 100% according to Vernon Gant and ""It works better if you're already smart."" -- so I guessed an IQ of about 130, otherwise Eddie Morra's down and out writer character would not have been plausible) multiplication of his IQ, that would probably have taken him to about 650. To get to 1000 (the lowest four digit IQ), his mental metabolic rate probably would have had to have been stepped up to about 1.54 times it's normal level too. That seems a bit implausible as well given that Vern spoke only of an access boost. But, in contrast to what I just said, his ex-wife Mellisa said she quit because she was afraid of burnout, so perhaps there could have been a mental metabolic increase after all.

Everything considered, flaws and all, this was a very engaging movie and well worth the purchase. No buyer's remorse here, I'm glad I bought it.",1379808000,,2244,4.492647058823529

The cinematography in this film is excellent and gives the viewer a true glimpse into the mind of the lead character while under the effects of the drug.  The first scene when the lead character first notices the effects of the drug is one of my favorites.  It has enough suspense to entice those who like action movies.  There are some parts of the film that require a suspension of disbelief, but those parts do not diminish the effectiveness of the movie.

Limitless made for a fun, Friday-night romp, but ten minutes after leaving the movie theater, I realized its plot relied on idiotic coincidences and presented a disturbing, pro-drug message.  It's too bad, really, that the writing was so questionable, because the acting and cinematography were quite strong.

Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling, non-household-name writer who nevertheless has been paid an advance on a book he hasn't written yet.  (Okaaay, but we'll let that one go for the moment.)  Just when he's about to drain down the toilet of despair, an old friend introduces him to NZT, a drug that allows him to utilize his brain's full potential.  You know the old wive's tale, of course: we mortals are cursed to only use a small fraction of our brain cells because the rest of it is preoccupied with things like pornography.  But NZT, the wonder drug, allows Eddie to fire up his full 100 percent.  Suddenly, he can place his order with a waiter in a foreign language; and gee, we've never ever seen that in a movie before.  He finishes his novel in four days -- four days! -- as computer-generated letters and numbers rain down upon him and his word processor to show us the miracle of this manna-from-heaven intelligence.

Soon, he makes a killing on the stock market and meets the financial world's godfather, played by Robert De Niro, whose name, Carl Van Loon, is surely coincidental to the character's being a loon.  Eddie's ex-girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), falls in love with this new persona and rewards him with sex.

Eddie also makes a killing in the form of a Courtney Love lookalike whom he murders during a drug-induced blackout.  So he uses his money to hire a high-rolling defense lawyer who -- coincidentally! -- works for Carl Van Loon's arch-nemesis, who employs a psycho henchman who -- coincidentally! -- has been following Eddie around all this time.

More hijinks ensue.  The cameraman goes crazy with a continuous-zoom effect that travels the length of Manhattan island and ends up sprayed all over the seat in front of me.  Eddie beats his murder rap, the Loon is outsmarted, Eddie is on the road to the presidency, and he flawlessly orders another meal in a foreign language he doesn't know.

And did I mention that the movie starts at the very climax of the story until Eddie jumps in as a voiceover to say that he'll now show us how he arrived at this point?

What's most disturbing about this movie is that it validates the drug culture.  It shows, again and again, that we're not smart enough or athletic enough to solve our problems without pills.  Eddie is rewarded, repeatedly, for his habit: he becomes rich, he gets the girl back, he gets away with murder, and he's set onto the road of ""limitless"" fame and fortune.

Oh, he says he's off the drug by the end of the movie -- he doesn't need it anymore -- presumably because he just thought his way out of it with his advanced intelligence.  After all, that's what Charlie Sheen teaches us, isn't it, that you can just blink your eyes and tap your ruby slippers to cure yourself of substance abuse.  Even if you believe that's possible -- and I hope by my tone you realize I don't -- Eddie's drug-free status at the end of the movie doesn't justify how he arrived there, which was by traveling the road of pharmaceutical assistance.

Limitless is a slick-looking movie.  It's mostly fun to watch.  But it's kind of like a big candy bar -- maybe one laced with LSD.  The side effects and the bad aftertaste aren't worth it.",1377734400,6,3555,4.664526484751204

 'Limitless' is one of those entertaining thrillers that (despite its ill-conceived ending), will appeal to the majority of ordinary males who have fantasies of becoming the kind of male women seem to automatically gravitate to: the alpha male. Indeed, the film's protagonist, Eddie Morra, the down and out novelist played by Bradley Cooper, represents an exaggerated version of the kind of situation, the average guy finds himself in, on a daily basis.

While most guys aren't down to their last buck like Morra, they can certainly can identify with his great dissatisfaction in the inability to achieve success in a career. It's not like Morra is some bum off the street: he's got an agent but has writer's block; the average guy can relate to Morra's inability to reach his potential. The same applies to women: Morra does have a very good-looking girlfriend, Lindy--but because he doesn't reach his potential and ends up projecting a negative image, she has no guilt feelings about dumping him.

'Limitless' allows the average male to indulge in the fantasy of becoming an instant alpha male without developing the skills. When Eddie runs into his ex-brother-in-law who gives him the illegal medication, 'NZT', we're ready to break into Act 2 and watch how Eddie is transformed. Perhaps the best scene in the movie is when Eddie must turn his brow-beating landlady around after she constantly screams at him for not paying his rent. Instead of adopting the motivational social skills of the ordinary schlub, the NZT allows Eddie to tap his full cognitive potential. Not only does he help the landlady with her paper for law school but also ends up bedding her without even trying.

A montage with voice-over allows us to see what else Eddie accomplishes 'under the influence', including learning how to play difficult classical music pieces on the piano as well as mastering multiple languages in a matter of a few days. Instead of turning into a mensch, Eddie decides to model himself after Gordon Gekko. He starts as a day trader and begins amassing some money and this is where perhaps the first plot hole appears in the film. If he's such a genius, why does he have to borrow $100,000 from a Russian loan shark? During a voice-over, Eddie claims he needs the money fast but given his talents, couldn't the newly transformed Eddie have made that kind of money in a week or two? His financial success leads Lindy to change her mind about him and she's back in his arms in no time. Eddie also insinuates himself into the business world of business tycoon Carl Van Loon (another average performance by Robert De Niro) and is on the verge of earning millions, advising Van Loon as he's about to complete a merger with Atwood, a business rival. Eddie's transformation now appears complete.

Screenwriter Leslie Dixon manages to keep things moving even after Eddie's transformation is finished. Since there is a limited supply of NZT, all the really bad guys are after Eddie including the loan shark and a stalker. What's more there are very bad side effects to this medication. Eddie is shocked to see his ex-wife, who is going downhill from NZT's side effects as well as discovering previous users have either died or are physically debilitated. Eddie also can't recall where he is for 18 hours and later he's implicated in a murder of a woman in a hotel.

There's also an exciting scene where the stalker goes after Lindy. She's seemingly cornered in Central Park (of all places) by the Stalker, but Eddie advises her to take one pill of NZT, which allows her to figure out how to stop her pursuer. Her escape is exciting but contains one ugly misstep: she grabs a little girl who's skating on an ice rink, and uses her as a human machete--slashing her pursuer with the blade of the little girl's skate (I wonder why no one chased her and why she wasn't initially charged with child endangerment).

The second act crisis is rather perfunctory, with Eddie going toe to toe with the Russian loan shark and his henchmen. There a few twists and turns in this confrontation, especially when Eddie runs out of his NZT, stabs the loan shark and is forced to drink his blood in order to get NZT back into his system.

While a good part of this is somewhat unbelievable, it all adds up to some breezy entertainment. Unfortunately, Leslie Dixon, the film's screenwriter opts for a typical Hollywood ending, which dilutes the film's overall impact. We're asked to accept that Eddie somehow overcomes the addiction to NZT and retains his mental abilities--even though everybody else becomes addicted and goes downhill after being unable resist, after taking one pill. I also wondered why Lindy did not succumb to the effects of NZT and become an addict (I guess since she's one of the 'good ones', she has the willpower to resist).

Finally, why should we really root for Eddie? Has he done anything good to help humanity? In the end he's a politician who rejects Van Loon, who wants to control him, even after he becomes president. But Eddie still is sleazy--after all he is a politician (not a brain surgeon!). A better ending would have Eddie sacrificing himself to save Lindy--penitence for his decision to use drugs and suck up to bad guy Van Loon.

I enjoyed 'Limitless' up to a point. It's a fast-paced thriller, undone mainly by a cheap ending, that makes little sense.",1370217600,2,5411,4.795064377682404
4525114,4,B0051MKMNC,"This was a great movie to rent in a hotel room.  Quick moving, lots of action, and just enough thought process to stay involved!",1369440000,2,128,4.333333333333333
4525115,5,B0051MKMNC,"This film deals with a subject that hasn't often been addressed in films.  What if there was a drug that could enhance your intelligence and give you superior ability?  Would it be worthwhile to take it?  What would be the consequences to your livelihood, your relationships, your personality, your character?

All of these issues are explored by the film and in a very realistic way.  The character development, in Eddie's case, is excellent.  Bradley Cooper(Eddie) does an outstanding job of going from a frumpy, down-and-out, aspiriring writer to a slick and competent human being. Then the crash he experiences when he goes through withdrawal from the drug is quite realistic.  I would also say that the script is excellent. I like the way it explores some of the more personal aspects of psychoactive drug use, like ""Am I really ME when I'm on the drug or am I someone else?"". The various scenarios (ie. Eddie and his girlfriend, Eddie and a Russian loan shark, Eddie in a day trading firm, Eddie and the corporate big wigs) all come across quite credibly and smoothly.  You know that this is the way that people act and talk.

The film does have some plot holes, like

1)  The police certainly would have searched Eddie's person and found the money and the stash of pills when they came to
  the apartment.  That probably would have ended the story right there.

2)  It's doubtful that someone would have framed Eddie for murder just so that they could get the pills.  Why would they think
  that it would work?

3)  It's not likely that a person as smart as Eddie would not have paid back the loan shark, knowing that his life depended
  on it.

4)  Why would Eddie even bother going to a loan shark at all?  With his enhanced abilities he could have made millions without that kind of help.

These are just a few holes in the story but I'm sure there are others.

What concerns me more is how the medication affected Eddie.  I'm concerned that he wasn't more upset about the murdered woman and the role (even unknowingly) he might have played in it.  I'm concerned that he didn't have more compassion for Hank Atwood and didn't try to save his life.  I'm concerned that while vacationing in the Carribean, he comes up with a ""vision"" for his life, but his ""vision"" basically involves making millions in day trading.  I'm wondering if this is actually part the cautionary tale and that one of the effects of enhanced ability is a lack of concern for others and for the betterment of society.  Does enhanced ability just turn a self-absorbed person into a more successful and adaptable self-absorbed person?  What are the consequences of that?  Maybe that gives some credence to him not paying the loan shark.  Perhaps he was so intoxicated with himself and his new abilities that he neglected to pay.

What makes this subject interesting is that a certain class of this type of drug already exists.  They're called amphetamines.  Back in the early twentieth century when amphetamines were first introduced they were considered the wonder drugs of the century.  People who struggled with fatigue, depression, timidity and poor self image took these drugs and experienced an immediate turn-a-round.  They became more productive and successful at work.  They were able to work longer hours without fatigue.  They became more socially engaging and self-assured.  Their family lives became more stable.  But there was a price.  We eventually discovered that these drugs were highly addictive and that users had to keep upping the dose to get the desired effect.  We also discovered that if too much were taken it could cause psychosis.  The wonder drugs turned out to be not so wonderful.

I suspect this is the case with most if not all performance enhancing drugs.  Sooner or later, there's going to be a reckoning to pay.  That's why I really didn't like the ending of the film.  Eddie's lab perfects the pill to such a degree that he doesn't have to take it any more.  The enhancing effects of the drug are now permanent and his life is now happy ever after.  Oh please!  Wouldn't it be better to have him come down off the meds and learn to cope with his natural imperfections?  I don't know.  I don't know what the ending should be, but I don't think it should be ""NZT solved all of my problems"".

Unless, of course, there's going to be a Limitless 2.  Hmm.......",1369267200,,4371,4.689973614775726
4525116,4,B0051MKMNC,"This Fincheresquely-filmed movie starring fellow barrel-maker Bradley is a lot of fun and deals with some very interesting ideas; but in order to preserve the mass-appeal necessary to make back its budget, the implications of these ideas are sometimes given short shrift.

For example, how are people's motivations affected by increased brain performance?  Are we to assume that since Bradley was a 'good guy' to begin with he wants to use his 4-digit IQ (good lord) to help humanity as a politician, and that the Russian 'bad guy' only has the acquisition of filthy lucre as his aim after becoming smart?  In other words, that a person's deepest desires remain unaffected by intelligence?  This is too simple and black-and-white; but it's understandable because these kinds of questions are better handled along the arc of a TV series rather than a 2-hour film.  Even so, I'd have preferred to see Bradley's newfound cognitive skills lead him to the selfish core of what had been his writing ambition and turn him into a monstrous cult leader, and for the Russian to have become a philanthropic engineer bent on inventing a process to provide cheap renewable energy.

Another more relevant issue, though, is why does big pharma seem to be more interested in turning off our thoughts and feelings than in turning them on?  One interpretation of the film is that turning them on would precipitate lost time, headaches, and eventual death; but really the film doesn't address this question at all.  And that's what limits it more than anything else.",1368835200,2,1547,4.9689922480620154
4525117,4,B0051MKMNC,"A far better film than I gave it credit for being, `Limitless' was one of those rare instances where a preconceived notion of a film is completely flipped after seeing it finally.  My best friend was ranting and raving over vacation about this movie being one of his favorites, and I kind of laughed because I just can't take Bradley Cooper seriously (this was before I finally saw `Silver Linings Playbook' yesterday, so bear with me).  That, and conceptually this just seemed so silly.

It is silly, but that isn't the point.

The basic premise is that an aspiring writer suffering from severe writer's block and lack of any funds falls into good luck (sort of) when he meets up with his ex-brother-in-law who was a former drug dealer and now is, allegedly, going legit for a pharmaceutical company pimping a drug that unleashes your brains full potential.  He gives our protagonist a free hit, which does its job remarkably well, and soon he's aching for more.  A murder and a burnout later and he's scrambling to keep his addiction, grow his funds and win back his girlfriend, all the while wooing a business prospect.  But things are falling apart, people are tracking him down and a certain thug is trying his hardest to get his hands on more pills.

The key to this film working is turning off your brain and allowing the director, Neil Burger, to warp your mind.  The film is executed really well.  For an action thriller, this nails all the right moments to create something engaging and thrilling.  The lighting, the sets, the pacing, the edits and the use of music is all key to propelling the film along.  The cast is decent enough, with Cooper surprising me with the amount of depth he brought to a well written role.  Abbie Cornish is wasted entirely, and De Niro phones in every minute of his screen time, but like I said, the star of the show is Burger.

4525138,5,B0051MKMNC,"Neil Burger does a terrific job directing Limitless and Bradley Cooper owns the lead role. Limitless took it lumps from the cinema snobs but I theorize that that was more due to ripple from Inception in 2010 and Bradley Cooper overload between 2010-2011 with A-Team, Hangover 2 and Limitless all hitting within a 12 month span.  Limitless is an excellent movie with a cool story.  Most defiantly worth adding to any movie collection.",1363651200,,433,4.917808219178082

4525149,5,B0051MKMNC,"See the movie first before reading this. 'Limitless' is one of those movies that you can show to anyone and know they will be hooked from beginning to end. This movie has all the fun stuff in it, suspense, action, romance told at a brisk pace, but also lots of life and business lessons; Our hero Eddie gets access to 100% of his brain by using a smart pill called NTZ. He tells us via narration,""Everything I'd ever read, seen and heard was now organized and available."" After hooking up with higher caliber friends (his useless relationships are ""better forgotten and put away in mothballs,"" he says) and going to  Puerto Valletta, Eddie says,""Mere lounging wasn't enough. Suddenly I knew what I needed to do. But it would take money to get there.""

In the beginning of the film, when Eddie is standing on the ledge of the building ready to jump, he talks about ""Wanting to make an impact on the world, instead of the pavement."" When explaining his book in the bar, Eddie mentions a 'utopian society.'  So we can guess that his final goal might be helping the world. When Eddie is accused of having 'delusions of grandeur' he retorts with, ""I have an actual recipe for grandeur."" Ah, a plan. Definite plans get definite results. Indefinite plans do not get 'indefinite results', they get NO results. Eddie says, ""I was clear. I knew what I needed to do, and how to do it.""

Eddie says, ""There are moments in your life when you cross a bridge and know that your old life is over."" And while a high level of success is necessary to express our true selves, Eddie cautions us with, ""We are all wired to over reach. Look at history, all the countries that ruled the world. No one stopped and said, 'We've got France, Poland, a big Swiss bank account. Let's not invade Russia in the winter. Let's go home, pop a beer and live on the interest.'"" Yes, better not fulfill the Peter Principle and rise to our level of our incompetence.

DeNiro makes a good point about earning your power by experience. He tells Eddie: ""Your super intellect is a gift from God, but you didn't earn it because you're careless with your power, flashing it around like a trust fund child. You never had to earn it year by year. You don't know how to assess your competition because you never had to compete.""

Finally, Eddie's success in now internalized and natural. When he speaks to a waiter in Chinese, his girlfriend looks at him in awe. Eddie turns to her, sees her expression and says, ""What?""

Leaving the theater after seeing 'Limitless' I heard some guy say, ""I wish I had the pill."" But all that Eddie does in this movie can be accomplished without the pill. See for yourself.",1361750400,,2660,4.517671517671518

4525151,5,B0051MKMNC,"Limitless is one of these rare films, where the preview doesn't give you a clue as to how good it really is. I saw this because the movie I wanted to see wasn't playing until 11, and I honestly didn't expect much from it. What I got was a visual masterpiece, with some of the best camera work I've ever seen, and an amazing story that was so much more than some guy and his magic pill. It's intense, shocking, and unique. Bradley Cooper really makes the movie. He FINALLY lets go of his super cool, good looking guy image, and really shows the audience that he can act! This movie was a breath of fresh air and I can't wait til it comes out on DVD so I can see it again!",1361664000,2,670,4.045112781954887

4525161,5,B0051MKMNC,"I absolutely loved this movie!

This is the unrated Extended Cut which gives two possible endings depending on which one you choose it is happy or sort of not.  After watching this movie I tracked down the book that this was originated from, The Dark Fields which later they renamed to the name of this movie.

The book sheds more light into the drug AZT and gives a more grim picture than what the movie version goes into.  I do not know if the book ""Limitless"" is word for word the same as ""The Dark Fields""  or if the movie titled book is the movie in print form.  I just went and tracked down the original title, which is much darker than the movie and goes into more aspects of the character and events that the movie glosses over.  The movie ending and the book ending are different and the story is slanted different as well so if you watched the movie go read the book as it adds more to the experience and vice versa.

This movie is one of my top favorite movies. The acting is good and I think they did a good job with casting the main character, he seems to fit the role.

I wouldn't get so caught up into the drug or possibilities of finding some similar product or mechanism to reproduce what is shown in the movie. It doesn't exist and if it did go read the book and it will scare the hell out of you to ever want to try something like this for real.

My big problem with it, is that this is, in essence, a Faustian bargain tale.  Such tales should not have a happy ending; it gives a moral of ""if it seems to good to be true, go for it.  Maybe it won't be"".  Not exactly either uplifting or properly cautionary.",1358553600,,459,4.428571428571429

4525170,5,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" was a very good movie with an original plotline and overarc. Physically, the packaging came in the yellow bubble mailer and was very expeditious. My wife and I had seen this in the past, although I cannot remember where, and we wanted it on Bluray due to the awesome quality of course but it was and has been very expensive.

I didn't really expect a whole lot from this movie, but I found that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's interesting to imagine what people would be capable of if they really could use the full potential of the human mind. Would it just be a mattter of heightened senses? The ability to rapidly scan and absorb and process information? The ability to mentally construct complex patterns, systems or ideas in short amounts of time? The ability to solve almost any problem? Or would it allow for almost super-natural powers such as telekinesis or telepathy? Who really knows? At least this movie does a good job exploring that concept and does it in an entertaining way.

If you never watched this movie and you consider yourself a mainstream movie watcher and generally are somebody that likes movies, then you will probably like this. If you are a critic and require an ""artsy"" and ""award-worthy"" component of some sort than you possibly may not care for this movie.

The premise is we only use 20% of our brains, and what we would be like if we could access the whole thing. The main character basically does just that, and it makes him feel limitless.  It was a fun movie and I believe Bradley Cooper is appropriately casted for the role.

True, this movie was fun thrill ride. which I enjoyed more via streaming because I could fast forward the sex and violence. I just wish it had chosen a more profound theme.

Director Neil Berger keeps the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace that causes you to stop for intermittent breaths.  Leslie Dixon's ingenious script is full of neat twists and turns with some deliciously cheeky humor.  Bradley Cooper's star continues to rise with his charismatic turn as a burned out writer turned super genius(not of the Wile E. Coyote variety) with the aid of some non-approved by the FDA pharmaceuticals.  Robert DeNiro steals virtually every scene he is in as a Wall Street power broker whose dual intentions are to tap into Cooper's zeitgeist and destroy him in the process.

4525200,3,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" gets off to a strong start - a dicey character hands out ""smart pills"" that really work. Pop one, and you're suddenly brilliant. In the case of this down-and-out writer, that means not just getting started on that novel stalled because of writer's block, but finishing in just a few days. Of course, being that brilliant becomes addictive.

The story moves along well. First, his dealer ends up dead. (What would a smrt guy do with that clue?) Then,to finance his venture, he borrows from the local loan shark (not so smart). Next, he flaunts his new-found ability as day trader, building up his financial head of steam - and I have to wonder whether taking such a high profile so fast was really a good idea.

Things get out of hand, though. The loan shark gets his hands on the pill, and dicovers that being a smart crook is more fun than just being a crook. And there are side effects - the kind that kill not just you, but maybe other people, too ...

This should have been an August movie. Just a few too many things seem just a bit too implausible for anything but a silly season flick. But, if you stifle your own intelligence, it's enjoyable enough.

This movie had already been out from quite awhile before I saw it. I hadn't seen a trailer or even knew what it was about. Perhaps that is why I enjoyed it, I had no preconceived expectations. I rarely enjoy Hollywood movies anymore. I watch mainly foreign an independent films. The reason for this, those films have a higher satisfaction rate of getting what you expect. Not over-hyped movies featuring overpaid actors where everything good to see in the movie is pieced together into a 30 second trailer!

Bradly Cooper does in outstanding job in this ""what if"" film. What if I could be a success? What if it were possible to have my dreams come true? What if I became a different person ... good or bad? Most of us has experienced these what if or if only moments. If we had a magic pill that helped us achieve our dreams, would we take it? If we did, would it change our personality or affect our moral decisions? Bradly Coopers character gets to ask those questions and receive the answers. Will he like the answers he gets? Will he fly like Icarus or spiral out of control? Where will this sudden realization take him? Will he stay on that road or take another one? Will it change him for better or for worse? What happens when other people want what you have?

This movie highlights what are each of us may be capable of under the right circumstances. How the choices we make and continue to make shapes our lives.

4525219,4,B0051MKMNC,"Bradley Cooper makes a decent fist of his role here, as the down and out writer struggling to find inspiration and motivation, who is introduced to a new pill.. this wonder pill allows the brain to access not just the 20% we use, but the whole brain - making him smarter, able to access every memory, and his abilities seem.. well, limitless.  Alas, this performance comes with a price.  The drug is not strictly legal, and he is not the only one who wants it.
It's a good hook, and broadly speaking the movie does a decent job of wringing a thriller out of it, and on the way makes some commentary on addiction - whether it is to drugs or to power or to consumerism - though unfortunately loses a lot of the bite as it progresses to an increasingly predictable thriller denouement.  Effects and editing are cleverly (if rather flashily) used to emphasise the heightened awareness, creating an oddly hallucinogenic mood as he transitions from down and out to super perceptive charmer and wheeler dealer.  In a supporting role Abbie Cornish does fine, and Robert de Niro shows up and says his lines in a throwaway role which seems almost perfunctorily added on.  Presumably he does just enough to get on the front cover to help sales, but it helps neither his career, or the film.
It's pretty exciting and relatively action packed, but with not too much violence.  All in all, any looming ridiculousness is staved off by a pace which doesn't allow you to think too much.  A shame perhaps, as with braver hands this might have been more of an interesting commentary rather than a thriller.. but it still works.  The directors name is Neil Burger.. perhaps if you consider the movie as cinematic fast food, it's a success.

4525229,3,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" is one of those dopey thrillers that comes along every year, where the filmmaker tries to supplant ""smart"" with ""hip"" and ""stylish.""  It's not much of the latter two either, a ""Fight Club"" redux, only this time instead of a split personality focused on violence it's a no personality focused on super intelligence.  Or super memory.  I'm not sure because the story never really shows the character being smart so much as acting like a human version of a computer, accessing and processing ideas at the speed of light without really stopping to reason much out.  Bradley Cooper -- who looks like Matthew McConaughey and Larry Fine had a baby -- lopes along playing a loser named Eddie pretending to be a writer and generally letting his days slide out from under him effortlessly.  His life is a trainwreck until a chance encounter (aren't they all?) with his ex brother in law introduces him to a pill that boosts his mental abilities to the point that he's learning languages in hours and making millions in the stock market.  That attracts a lot of publicity, one of the first signs that he isn't too bright, along with loans from the Russian mob, another sign, that cause his life to spiral out of control.  ""Limitless"" dodges all the meaningful questions of what would happen if someone suddenly discovered his mind worked better than anyone else's, the sort of thing novels like ""Flowers for Algernon"" and its film adaptation tackled 40 years ago. when stories like these were imaginative . . . instead, it lets Eddie act like an out of control frat boy who suddenly discovers sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Robert DeNiro phones in a performance as a corporate raider type.  Worse are the women in the story.  Abbie Cornish, for instance, plays the standard shallow girlfriend who doesn't want anything more to do with Eddie when he is a loser but is immediately charmed when he becomes a winner -- a particularly unbelievable scene happens when Eddie, suffering from withdrawal, staggers into her workplace, to the understandable shock of everyone, and then remains on the floor while she goes to get his pills and is chased by a knife-wielding assassin . . . all while staying on her cell phone with him.  Just another day at the office I suppose.  It's worse later when Eddie has to get his hit of the drug from a disgusting source.  ""Limitless"" plays like a 20-year-old's understanding of the world, which is to say it is about chases and one-ups instead of anything meaningful.  No one expects a thriller nowadays to be particularly mature, but ""Limitless"" is, in fact, limitless in its childishness.",1330819200,4,2623,4.787139689578714

He gets it all: money, women, power, in exchange for his life as the pill slowly makes him sicker.  I thought the ending would be of him dying or something, so the actual ending kind of upset me.
The moral of the story: cheaters always win. Plus, like someone else pointed out, it was almost like they were promoting drug use. YES, I watched the whole movie; I know that it was a mind enhancing drug that allowed you to use more of your brain power, but it was basically like any other drug. It made him sick and addicted.
 But using the powers that the drug gave him, he sidestepped his punishment (death) even though he pretty much deserved it. What he didn't deserve was to live on with no consequences. It's not only the moral issues that bothered me, but also the fact that they left plot points unfinished. Like what happened to his ex-wife and who killed that woman?

4525232,1,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" serves only to irresponsibly indulge fantasies of those who want to be rich, attractive, and sexually active.  That being said, a lot of people will like it, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone.  The protagonist pursues drugs, money, sex, and power with little restraint while managing to escape a lot of natural negative consequences.  Five-word synopsis: Drug brings man material success.

In a moment that almost gives hope to those of us with a sense of morality, Robert DeNiro's character cautions the protagonist about his rapid rise in status, saying that he did not earn it like others have.  At this point I felt like there might actually be a moral to the story, but as the movie continues the word of warning turned out to be hollow; the film scoffs at morality, paints a man who is not good as the good guy, and heaps material reward upon him.  Meanwhile, viewers are shown some rather disgusting violence.

The acting and direction is done well enough, but it led me to a place I didn't want to go.  However, some people will enjoy this fancifully amoral fantasy.

Bradley Cooper proves to be quite the actor as well; he plays both the burnout unmotivated writer, to brilliant rich guy on the move equally well.

I would have preferred they stayed a bit longer with the great successes he was experiencing in the beginning...the downhill path Cooper has is fast, steep, and dangerous to say the least. DeNiro's casting and role is perfect as well.",1329004800,,619,4.839622641509434

And trust me, I watch dozens of films in 2011, many of which were great too. With this film, I have become an indesputable fan of Bradley Cooper, and it's my favorite actor after Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. I had seen the digital copy elsewhere and loved it so much, I had to buy the BluRay, which I got for an awesome price during Black Friday.

The story is unique. I don't remember seeing any other film where the male lead happens to take a drug that would basically make him a genius, and does it in such a way that it's just thrilling. Not much else to say, I straight up loved this film.

We get a glimpse of all that's possible when his mind starts to function at full capacity. However, we also get to see the negative side effects of relying on chemical enhancement. The negative side effects are the primary drivers of the drama in this movie, as well as the attempt to mitigate those effects. This establishes the crux of the whole movie: Who succeeds in the end, the man who takes the drug, or the drug itself?",1328486400,,598,4.598130841121495

It's a different twist on drug abuse that's not really discussed much. Sure, lots of college frat boys are taking ADHD drugs to try to cover up for too much partying when exams roll around. But if we can make drugs that warp our minds as much as LSD, why not make a drug that improves acuity by a similar degree? It makes you wonder if Big Pharma does have such a drug but keeps it under wraps while they feed us more Viagra.

As a story, this movie failed to grip me from the very beginning.  I felt no connection to the main character.  When we first meet Bradley Cooper (at this point, I can't even remember his character's name, and I just finished watching the movie about 5 hours ago) he was down and out.  In the course of five minutes, we see him struggling to write a book (even though he oddly enough already has a contract for what I believe is a fiction--not normal), he loses his girlfriend, and we are told that he lost his first wife several years ago.  But that's it, within five minutes, he gets a drug, his life gets better, and all he ever has to struggle for again for the remaining 139 minutes is to maintain the steady dosages of the drug.  His entire life turns around pretty much.  He gets his girlfriend back, he gets millionaire friends, completes his book, begins trading stocks and hedge funds once he realizes that his life's calling.  I mean, at no point, are we really given a chance to feel for this guy.  As Robert de Niro most aptly pointed out, HE DIDN'T EARN ANYTHING.  He didn't put in work, he didn't put in effort, and yes, we are supposed to believe that his life sucked for a time before all of his success, but we barely see that.  There are a couple of instances where we are led to believe that he almost loses it all--the murder investigation, the sudden sickness, the thugs beating him up, but really, he doesn't even come close.  He's definitely not the standard protagonist and in 144 minutes, the writer's could not even develop his role so as to make him more human, more accessible, and somehow reconcile the person he became with the ""bum"" he once was.  If they had, I think we would get a character worthy of a movie.  As it is, this character isn't even worthy of a bedtime story.",1325462400,4,1940,4.428169014084507

I watched this with my friends in the theatre. The plot and the acting keep me interested from the beginning till the end. It's about a wonder drug that enable people to recall everything they saw. They're able to master everything such as a new language after looking at TV for a couple of minutes! Wow! Of course, people can get rich quickly with that ability. The best thing about this movie is the amazing camera tricks. They effectively portray the effects of the drug that happen to Eddie, the main character.

It also frighteningly shows the side effects of the drug. It strongly reminds me drug is a death trap. In the end, Eddie said he had got rid of the drug. However, he still had that magical mental ability. I doubted his sincerity. The ending was open because it did not give any clue that Eddie's statement was true.

In short, it's one the BEST movies released in 2011 in terms of thriller.",1324252800,,923,4.514970059880239
4525254,4,B0051MKMNC,"Limitless uses an interesting concept you've probably have seen before: Is there a cure all for our limitations, an ""easy button"" for life?. For Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), this comes in the form of NZT, a pill that is designed to enhance a person's cognitive abilities and focus.  Eddie, a failed writer, sees that the possibilities are infinite, as he can become twice the writer he was, and has a newfound mental power that enables him to react to all life's dilemmas. Limitless takes this premise and runs with it, making it a quick-paced, thrilling ride, putting you right in Eddie Morra's world.

The director uses both visual effects and quick-paced action along with an engaging script to come up with a film that works and keeps you glued to the screen. Eddie, an antihero or sorts, is a likable loser who drinks too much and has trouble finding jobs, the ability the write, or finding his place in life.  When he begins taking NZT, the positive results are instantaneous--he writes a book in a few days, he plays and wins at the stock market, he impresses his ex-girlfriend, he feels a newfound success. However, as you could probably guess, as things are going too good for Eddie, that things will eventually blow up in his face. He realizes that there are scary side effects and a dark nature to NZT, and that former users have had mysterious and sometimes violent ends. Things really take off as Eddie tries to figure out his world and the effects of the drug amid the chaos of being pursued by thugs.

While Limitless does many things well, the ending, in my opinion, was a bit too safe, anticlimactic and tidy, and it's probably the weakest part of an otherwise engrossing film. It's the kind of ending that doesn't really leave much of an impression, rendering the resolution typical and predictable, when it could have been more memorable. Still, Limitless is an exciting experience, an action film with an interesting look at the benefits and negatives of ""artificial"" intelligence in the form of a pill.",1324080000,,2024,4.7578347578347575

Bradley Cooper was a perfect fit for the role; I could not have seen anyone else act his part.  However, some of the scenes seem forced.

Bradley Cooper, in his most tolerable role yet,  is a mumbling post modern hippy trying to finish a book.  One day an old friend gives him a skittle on steroids and he becomes a superhero Einstein, stealing a nooner with the landlords woman after impressing her with law speak.

Director Neil Burger employs an inventive use of vanishing point zooms to draw us, and our Walter Mitty through the vortex of a speed freak with a bottomless diet of knowledge.  It's a fun ride all the way through.  The disappointments are few.  Robert de Niro  feels superfluous as does the ravishing Abbie Cornish.

4525267,4,B0051MKMNC,"Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job in this film. He is virtually in every scene and he is magnificent at holding the attention of the viewer as this strange tale unwinds. This is not small feat because watching someone for two hours can certainly become a drag if the actor or actress is not able to constantly evoke energy and tension as the narrative develops. I have never seen the guy in a film before but he certainly convinced me of his skills in this film.

The story is witty, a story of a deadbeat writer who can't write and who has run off his girlfriend, played to perfection by Abbie Cornish. I have never seen this lady in a film before but she holds her own. Back to the story - Eddie Morra, the dead-beat writer, is offered some pill by his ex-wife's drug dealing brother. The pill makes every synapse in the brain work overtime and thus every thought, fact, and memory are now accessible at lightening speed. However, like all drugs, what goes up must come down. This film is a nice parable about the actions of drugs, particularly the message that nothing is free in life. Before long, Eddie is involved in more dangerous situations than you can count, and this provides much of the drama of the film.

I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending was too nicely wrapped up. I would have preferred an ending that was as dirty and gritty as the majority of the film, but hey, some folks like their movies to end in a nice pretty tied up package.

The benefits are impressive: rapidly finishing challenging projects, learning new languages with ease, making big money by discerning patterns no one else can, becoming irresistible to attractive women, and generally moving up in the world.  But of course there's also no free lunch, since other people (including bad guys) will take notice and want a piece of the action, plus the pill itself turns out to be addictive and has serious side effects, including potential death.

While I enjoyed the exploration of this concept, and the acting was also pretty good (De Niro stood out), my one complaint is that the plot construction seemed somewhat haphazard in an amateurish way, which really took away from the believability of the movie, so I found it hard to stay fully engaged.  For this reason, I have to deduct one star, but I can still recommend the movie to people who have fantasized about what it would be like to be super smart.",1321142400,8,1124,4.869109947643979

Well, having read those very same reviews myself, I'm here to comment on them and the amazing quality of the movie and not the PREVIEWS, NOT Fox's cntrol of the screen menue!

For those of you that find your user interface very important while watching the movie (such as being able to skip previews before the movie even begins) then you should avoid all of Fox's new DVD's and Blu-Rays for the rest of your life and stop whining about it.

For those of you who really want to see a great movie, see this movie. Don't let the bad reviews of a few people ruin it for the rest of you.

But then he meets the ""former dope dealer"" brother of his ex-wife who gives him a sample of NZT, what he claims is a radical new ""FDA approved"" drug that allows one's brain to not only recall but make sense of everything it has ever absorbed.

On the drug, which Morra discovers is not FDA approved, he turns in his previously blocked but now brilliant manuscript in a few days.  In record time, he parlays a few thousand dollars into millions on Wall Street.  And then he catches the eye of ruthless billionaire trader Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) and nefarious individuals who plan to force Morra to broker the biggest deal ever and will do anything to control the drug and keep it from Morra unless he does their bidding.  Morra ends up in a desperate race with gangsters and the police to maintain his supply of NZT until he can figure out how to survive what seems like an impossible situation.  Oh yes, the drug has dangerous, debilitating, perhaps fatal side effects.

None of the plot described here begins to convey the intensity of the movie experience and the surprises along the way.

I think the concept of, ""it's already there, it just needs to come out"" has always been interesting when it comes to the human psyche, and this movie definitely explores that.  I also appreciated that there was no major lame plot twist just for the sake of being shocking.  It didn't need it.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but I won't put any spoilers on here!

Definitely something to watch just for fun, and as a bonus, it's also a bit thought-provoking.",1319328000,2,952,4.658682634730539

4525279,4,B0051MKMNC,"I'm not sure what to make of the fact that my search on Amazon only returns the Unrated Extended Cut of Limitless. I watched the ""rated"" version, so I'm not sure what was different.

Anyway, this is another movie that drew me in with its intriguing premise...a pill which facilitates/compels you to use 100% of your brain rather than just the small fraction that we normally use. It's intriguing to this about what to do with that unlocked potential ability.

I felt like Bradley Cooper's character was well developed in such a way as to give us a good juxtaposition of just how far this pill could take you. I was glad it didn't take on a ""superhero"" aspect a la 'Matrix' or something like that, but it was cool to see his interactions and reactions to difficult situations. I also loved that the movie drilled down on the consequences. As the adage goes: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. It was cool to see everything fall apart due to his lack of respect/planning for the power he held.

I felt like the movie really expanded on the idea of how much each of us could truly be capable of if we would just stretch ourselves to try and use our full potential (even without a magic pill). Taken back down to us ""normal brain users"", there are good messages there...we should stretch ourselves, we should live up to our own potential, we should set high expectations and try to achieve them, we should set goals, we should plan, we should get off our butts and do something worthwhile. This was a fun and thoughtful movie with a subtle underlying message.

3.5 out of 5 stars",1318377600,,1585,4.531468531468532
4525280,4,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" is an entertaining thriller that keeps you interested, not because of its plot which is certainly interesting but not very convincing, but because of the strong acting from the lead Bradley Cooper. Here the ""Hangover"" star plays Eddie Morra, a wannabe writer who has been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish, ""Sucker Punch"").

On the worst day of his life, Eddie gets ""NZT-48"" - a new drug that enhances brain activity to its maximum level. One tablet will make you not ""high,"" but ""clear."" Using the drug, Eddie begins to reinvent his life, but as you know, some drugs can cause side effects.

""Limitless"" does not take itself too seriously. The NZT is a narrative device that is too convenient but serviceable enough. Robert De Niro appears as a business tycoon, and Anna Friel is effective as Eddie's ex-wife, but it is Bradley Cooper who carries the suspense film throughout, as a desperate protagonist you just cannot hate. It is regrettable that director Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"") didn't come up with a better way for Cooper's character to use such amazing abilities. What Eddie really wants to do is not always clear, and when it is clear, it is not very interesting.

The thriller keeps a good pace. The film also has stylish visuals, and the story is unpredictable, but enjoyable as it is, ""Limitless"" suffers from some loose ends and major plot holes that could have been easily tied up and fixed. (How many tablets does he have? What really happened to the woman at the hotel?)

""Limitless"" is a slick thriller with a few suspenseful moments, but works most effectively as a showcase for the acting talent of the star Bradley Cooper.",1318204800,,1672,4.835664335664336

4525287,3,B0051MKMNC,"This may have made a better tv episode of something for an hour because the movie doesn't know what to do with itself in the second half.  We have everything we need to know and understand happen in the first half.  The rest just meanders with that same material.  Our lead character takes a super drug which lights up the dormant part of his brain so that he is using all of his brain all of the time. The hitch is that you have to keep taking the drug.  He inherited the stash of his late, murdered brother-in-law.) But while he is taking it, he becomes fabulously rich and increasingly powerful.

This is very slick, stylish and visually beautiful for the first hour and then that aspect is exhausted.  Unfortunately, the remainder of the movie becomes the standard action flick with the hero trying to stay alive as various unsavory characters want the drug.  I think if the lead had been made into a scientist, who decided to experiment on himself with his own new drug, this would have been more believable.  It is scarcely believable that his scraping along brother-in-law had his own huge stash of the drug laying around and that no one else knows about this drug.",1316995200,2,1172,4.5476190476190474

4525289,3,B0051MKMNC,"I loved the plot concept. But it's execution was kind of stupid. It could have been a lot smarter than it was. It leaves me with many questions to ask.

1. Why did Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) not pay back the Russian loan-shark? He made millions of dollars super fast (completely legally), and the loan was only $100,000. If the drug made him smarter, why did he forget to do this? More than half of his problems in this film would not have happened had he remembered to do this. But did he really forget? He couldn't have. Maybe he thought he could get away with the money without paying him back? Who knows?

2. Why did he not immediately try to ration his limited supply of NZT? Or better yet, why didn't he immediately seek out a scientist to either make more of the drug or find out how to reverse engineer it? He starts deliberately taking more than he should. He should have known the bad effects that would have occurred.

3. Why did Eddie allow Carl van Loon (Robert DeNiro) to convince him to continue working for him when Eddie politely told him his plans to go his own way? The only argument van Loon had was ""I know this business and have more experience."" Realistically speaking, this argument is useless considering the superior mental power that Eddie had and the superior rate at which HE was making money compared to van Loon.

4. When Lindy took the NZT to escape the trench coat assassin, she immediately knew how to do parkour? She doesn't look like she's in shape to be running and hopping over everything. No drug makes you good at parkour without practice.

5. Similar to note number 4, Eddie becomes a master fighter because the NZT helped him remember fighting videos he watched? Anyone who tries to do what they see in martial arts movies without any proper training ends up dead. No drug will make you fight better unless it makes you move so fast that the world is in slow motion and you're not.

The worst of course, is that he successfully predicted a texting driver would crash into another car.  Out of all ways and means to prove this guy is brilliant, the movie has to resort to complete random chance.

Not to say it was terrible - it was entertaining but too many scenes threw me off.  It's a problem to have a genius run into problems he could have easily avoided.  The final scene is Cooper chewing down on De Niro when in fact that speech should be geared toward the audience, not some small character we don't care about and can't connect to.  There were not enough connections to everyday events (people) to engage us.

4525305,5,B0051MKMNC,"My expectations were low for this, and so maybe I am over-rating it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I was glued to my seat the entire time, and appreciated the unique storyline, in a sea of predictable alien/robot/superhero action films. Bradley Cooper plays a down-and-out writer, actually a bit of a loser that can't quite get it together, who stumbles upon a new off-the-market drug that maximizes brain potential to such a degree that he (and other who have possession of it) can completely transform their lives. He becomes a 'master of the universe' - first writing his long-delayed book in 4 days, and then turning his sights to the financial markets. The action involves his battles with others trying to steal his stash of drugs, his attempts to understand the side-effects, and to figure out how to extend his limited supply. In the meantime, he is attempting to impress Robert DeNiro who plays a financial king, as part of his path to wealth and power.

This is really the first time I have taken any real notice of Bradley Cooper, and I think he does a great job here. He is better suited for quirky, somewhat twisted roles like this one than standard leading man roles I think. Robert DeNiro is always fun to watch, and the supporting cast does what they need to do.

There were minor weaknesses in the plot - how did Cooper's loser writer character ever get a book contract? Why isn't there some kind of adjustment period to achieving maximum brain potential? How is this drug kept secret except to a very few? etc. But overall, it delivers action, is not predictable, and Bradley Cooper gives it his all, so I think it deserves a 5-star rating.",1315180800,3,1665,4.659863945578231

The first half of the movie lived up to the expectations and set the proper tone for what this sort of experience and capability would be like.

But the second half of the movie seemed like it was written by a different screenplay writer and led by a different Director.
The second half of the movie really faded into a sort of comedy and all the tensions and initial build-up was lost.

In the end, the film failed to fully capitalize on its initial brilliance.

Add to that the fact one must overlook the obvious logic flaws in the movie .....

Foe example, if this drug was able to make your mind so sharp and able to learn and master new skills like Classical Music and 3-4 foreign languages in only 2 days, would it have not seemed obvious to spend 3-4 days learning Chemistry so you could synthesize the mind enhancing drug yourself and thus not be reliant on somebody else for a supply ?

Limitless is based off the 2001 book called ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn.  The story centers around Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper), a wannabe writer who somehow has a writing contract, yet he hasn't written one word of his expected novel, he is dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish), who as she put it was his ""cleaning lady"" and his ""bank"".  So basically Eddie is a washed up bum.  But then as a chance of fate, he runs into his ex brother-in-law, Vernon,(Johnny Whitworth) a drug dealer who gives him a pill nicknamed NZT that he says will enhance his creativity and cause him to use 100% of his brain.  At first Eddie seems skeptical but decides to take the pill.  Surprisingly the pill works, and Eddie becomes so smart he is able to write his entire novel in 4 days.

Eddie comes to find Vernon to get more pills, and Vernon tells him to get his laundry and bring him breakfast first, Eddie finishes the errands and returns to Vernon's apartment to find the place torn apart and Vernon murdered.  Knowing whoever done this must have been looking for Vernon's stash, Eddie searches all over and finally finds the pill and some cash inside the oven.

With his huge supply of pills and some starting capital, Eddie is able to find secret formulas in the stock market and make a ton of cash in just a few days.  A big investor, Carl Van Loon,(Robert De Niro) becomes very interested in him.  Eddie feels he is on top of the world, but there are still some problems.  The drug is highly addictive and if he stops taking it he realizes he loses his intelligence and he becomes very sick.  The drug has strange side effects such as loss of time, and black outs.  Also, a strange man keeps following him, and even tries to kill his girlfriend when she has the pills on her to bring to Eddie when he is suffering from NZT withdrawal.

As the movie progresses, Eddie has to deal with all the people that want his drug, and he has to keep finding ways to get more.  He discovers billionaire investors that made all their money because of this incredible drug.  He pays scientists to figure out the ingredients and make more, so that he has a limitless supply to support is limitless intelligence.

This movie caught my attention because of the idea that you could be so incredibly smart that you could become the richest person on the planet, the president of the United States, every woman would want you, the possibilities would be limitless(hence the name, but everything comes at a price, and at the end of the day it would a drug you were taking, and we all know the consequences of drugs.  I'm now interested in reading the novel which I may review next.  But if you haven't seen this movie yet you're in for a real treat.",1314057600,2,2992,4.431444241316271

Another thing I liked about the character is that he didn't try to con everyone. He just made an honest money although going through the loan shark was a dumb idea. I liked De Niro's role and he really shines at being a bull-headed businessman. I also liked the ending where the character tweaked the bugs out of the drug and improved it so it becomes permanent. He could've been an FBI profiler solving tough cases or a doctor finding cures for deadly disease instead of a Senator but of course, that's just me.

4525328,3,B0051MKMNC,"From start to stop this is the noisiest film. Occasionally there are a few known pieces of music from classical masters. Yet for the most part it is obscure pieces of music overwhelming the dialog. Occasionally there is musicales spot where they still play jingles or extremely loud sounds of glass breaking or footstep noises.

If you can get over the noisy background the primes is pretty good.  I would not want to presume on telling the producers how to improve this film but it is really too much like those soundbite documentaries were they do not complete a thought before moving on to the next thought.

Basic story is Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) a going nowhere would be writer who stumbles in a situation where he obtains a substance that allows him to utilize parts of his brain that were previously unreachable. Now we are off and running. Where is the substance coming from and are there any side effects. Watch and find out.

If you can get over the noise there are a few fun spots where you can put yourself in the situation.

4525333,5,B0051MKMNC,"I really enjoyed LIMITLESS with Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Abbey Cornish.
This is a very sharp & smartly done modern morality tale which raises the question...
If you were just an average Joe Blow, who was barely just getting by, living your life in a haze
of less than spectacular stimuli, opportunities, and results...or as a great person once said,
""In quiet desperation""...and the circumstances came along where you gained access to a magical drug
which could make you super sharp, more aware, intelligent, well-versed and worldly...WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
Would you go the cliche' route of the FOOL'S PARADISE??---Doing as much mindless partying, sleeping
with the most beautiful people you could encounter, scamming to get as much money as you could, only to rip
through it in no time flat, only to scheme to get some more?---Or would you practice moderation and use your
new found gifts with benevolence, and for the betterment of not only yourself, but others?
The combinations and scenarios of what we MIGHT DO if we could have access to these powers are endless!

Bradley Cooper's character is living just such a marginal mediocre exsistence at first...
Until fate brings him into a world of amazing highs and privilege, but also mind-numbing lows and consequences,
which will test the metal of his very soul, and all who lay in his wake.
This movie is filled with thrills, intrigue, face-paced dialogue, plot twists, and plenty of action throughout.
Of course, there are always negative effects to anything that we do.
That whole yen v.s. yang thing...but ultimately, it's all about balance in life, right?
I watched this all the way through twice, back to back, and I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone.

Robert De Niro plays an old lion, who made his bones the old-fashioned way...
He had to reach through the flames to get it. He's a grizzled New York high level player
whose nobody's fool, and is not one to cross. He sees this new, seemingly-so-together, young lion,
(Cooper) as someone who could be a possible strong ally, as well as a possible threat to all he has built up.
The relationship between the two is one of mutual admiration, and mutual distrust at the same time.
The last scene between them is KILLER!

4525335,1,B0051MKMNC,"The premise of this movie is that the protagonist discovers a drug that allows people to use 100% of their brains. This premise of course, exploits the common misconception that humans normally use only a small fraction of their brains. But in reality, the only people who normally use a small fraction of their brains are people with severe brain damage or those in persistent vegetative states and also Hollywood execs that green-light garbage like this. There should be some expectations, of course, for an audience to suspend their usual healthy dose of skepticism known commonly as the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" But audiences shouldn't be expected to become complete cretins just to enjoy a movie as seems to be the expectations of the film makers for this movie. The film leaves several logical loose ends. One keeps asking oneself why if the drug may be taken without many serious side effects as the film's ending hints at isn't everyone on the drug? for example.

Unfortunately, this movie did not make for a very interesting cinematic experience. It could have been interesting if it focused on the ethical issues associated with such a drug for example but it took the low route and tried to make a conventional action thriller but containing little entertaining action and thrills. The common cheap plot devices to increase suspense are employed but no novelty either in the form of the overall plot or suspense are employed. The lead actor played by Bradley Cooper often seems robotic (even when he wasn't supposed to be strung out on the drug). This is a very forgettable movie with asinine dialogue and mediocre acting at best.",1313625600,14,1651,4.938848920863309

4525337,4,B0051MKMNC,"Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro in the same film? That got my interest. And a premise about a human with limitless abilities? Also intriguing, though I worried it would turn into a spinoff of the recent flood of superhero movies. Instead, ""Limitless"" is more down-to-earth and more layered.

Cooper's character is an author with a book contract, but no ability or discipline to focus that talent. He is losing sleep, relationships, and peace. When he bumps into his former brother-in-law on the streets of New York, that all changes. He is introduced to a new drug, and soon he is flying high on the new energy and focus it gives him, allowing him to access the full potential of brain--but at a cost. If he stops taking the drug, he gets sick and discovers that even death could result. More immediately, though, there are others after this illegal substance and the effects it can produce.

Mixing stylistic elements of ""Fight Club"" and story elements of ""Wall Street,"" this movie spins off into its own interesting take on the limits of the human mind and its potential for danger. It also comes across as a veiled expose of the prescription drug industry. Don't get me wrong, though. ""Limitless"" is not a message movie, at least not overtly. Overall, it's a very entertaining, somewhat thought-provoking, and ultimately violent tale of the good and evil that await us in a society where access to all sorts of drugs becomes ""Limitless.""",1313539200,,1441,4.82995951417004
4525338,3,B0051MKMNC,"Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is having a good night. The best in a long time. An old friend turned him on to a new favorite. Nothing better than a dealer who's high....Be high, convince Eddie to try! And Eddie Morra does indeed try.

Turns out this highly addictive new favorite is an experimental drug that Eddie's old friend has somehow gotten his hands on and there are some rough and tough people that also want their hands on it. So when Eddie winds up with a significant stash of this new favorite these rough and tough people now want to get their hands on Eddie. But Eddie has an advantage over his foes you see...the new favorite unlocks the full (superhuman?) potential of the brain, which according to the movie humans only use 20% of. Ah...well that explains why I spend so much time writing reviews for no pay!

Limitless was a pretty fast paced entertaining movie. Limited special effects are very good, and there are some very cool camera special effects at the start of the film (that actually get a little monotonous by the end of the film). While the pills that Eddie was taking were easy to swallow, a lot of the plot line was not. I mean for starters, this would be a pretty breakthrough, highly secret and tightly secured and scrutinized discovery. So let's say even if someone very high up in the pharma company manufacturing the drug was interested in the intentional or inadvertent leak to the public of the drug in such large quantities, it would not be as easy as Limitless makes it seem like it is. But if you don't think too much about this and some other plot line flaws and inconsistencies, you have pretty good movie here.

So the movie all in all is a pretty fun ride and we see Eddie become an addict of perhaps the most irresistible narcotic to ever be discovered. If you don't think that you would ever get addicted to this drug, you can't understand a user's mind. You could try with your books and degrees, but if you let yourself go and open your mind I'll bet you'd be doing like Eddie. And it ain't so bad.",1313452800,,2046,4.450666666666667
4525339,3,B0051MKMNC,"The plot of this movie is simple. A man takes pills that unlocks 80% of his brain that regular humans don't use. To me, it's a very catchy plot, because who doesn't want that? The story picks up right off the bat, and for the first 30 minutes or so, it moves quite nicely. However, it fall into a slump for about 40 minutes, where, to tell the truth, I was bored out of my mind, and was thinking about shutting it off. However, it redeems itself with an entertaining chase through the park, and a house robbery. All in all, it was ""OK"". 3 stars is good enough for this film",1313366400,,573,4.125
4525340,3,B0051MKMNC,"There are movies made with fantastic premises that you just want to see. The previews make them out to be something new and original and thrilling. And then you see them and think wow...that was...okay. Unfortunately most movies just don't live up to the hype. Such was the case with LIMITLESS, a good movie but one that just wasn't great.

Bradley Cooper stars as Eddie Morra, a down on his luck writer with one mediocre novel published and a case of writer's block. Just when he thinks things can't get worse, his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) dumps him. Walking down the street after she turns him lose, he comes across an old ""friend"", the brother of his ex-wife (of one day) Vernon (Johnny Whitworth).

Back in the day Vernon was a dealer and Eddie wants nothing to do with him. But he seems cleaned up, cleanly dressed and doing well for himself. During lunch he passes a new drug to Eddie, tells him that it's about to be FDA approved and that it will help him. The drug helps the person taking it use their entire brain potential. While its said human's only use perhaps 20% of their brain, this one kicks in the entire 100%.

On his way to his apartment Eddie takes the drug thinking he has nothing to lose and runs into his landlord's girlfriend on the steps. As she berates him for not having the rent, the drug kicks in and he not only talks his way out of the chastising but beds the girlfriend as well. The drug actually works. So much so that Eddie changes his lifestyle, writes the book he was working on in 2 days and it turns out to be perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.

Then he comes down off the drug. He finds Vernon to get more and Vernon now has Eddie where he wants him, doing his bidding. Eddie sets out to get Vernon's dry cleaning only to return and find Vernon with a hole in his head and the apartment trashed. Whoever showed didn't get what they came for, Vernon's stash of the drug. But Eddie figures out where it is and becomes a regular user.

He gets his life back on track, learns languages in less than a day, wins back his old girlfriend and starts a new life for himself, all with this limited supply of pills. He cashes in on financing, goes to work for his broker and is introduced to one of the top moneymen in the country, Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). This leads to a job with Van Loon and the chance to turn what he's learned into millions if not billions for the company and himself. It also gives him access to possibly having someone make more of the drug.

But it all comes at a cost. The loan shark who gave him the money to invest originally now is taking the drug and wants more. And whoever it was that killed Vernon is trying to find him as well. Eddie has risen from the worst position possible to the highest and yet still has problems, just different ones, ones that could cost him his life.

The movie has a terrific look to it, clean and sleek and fast. When the drug kicks in we look through the eyes of Eddie as well as from the outside, seeing that things move so much faster in his mind that the world seems to be in slow motion. And while Eddie's brain increases in capability, he doesn't seek to do harm to anyone but rather intends to do nothing more than take care of himself and those that matter to him. But as they say the best intentions...

Cooper does a great job, shifting in acting modes as well as appearances from the down and out Eddie to the more successful one. He carries off the performance well and is completely believable. Cornish feels as if she's just there and DeNiro makes the most of what is essentially a supporting role.

For all the great story that is found here it just comes off as a decent flick that doesn't completely fulfill it's potential. Perhaps that's just my expectations not being met, but I just felt that the movie was nothing more than another in a long line of films that are entertaining but not memorable. And honestly, there don't seem to be that many being made any longer.

Most will find the movie is an enjoyable film that will keep you guessing until the end. And the ending itself was one of the best I've seen in some time. So if you're looking for a solid movie to rent this week then by all means give this one a try. It may not stick in your mind forever but it will give you a pleasant night watching a movie.",1313366400,,4350,4.29390243902439

4525343,3,B0051MKMNC,"The problem with making a movie about intelligence, is the lack of intelligence possessed by the people making the movie.

A modern day version of the fairy tale Jack & the Beanstalk, the hero is given some ""beans"" by some stranger which he ""plants"" unthinkingly. The beans take him to a castle in the sky where unbelievable riches are simply lying around for the taking. Hold on though--there's a giant that wants nothing more than to grind his bones to make his bread!

The parts that aren't inspired by the tale of Jack and his magic beans are the women in his life, and the anti-drug and moralistic themes that somehow lose their way as the film winds to a close. And these are what ruined the film.

Eddie's ex and current girl both try the brain-boosting drug. The ex shows the terrible effects of taking too much brain food, but at the end, conveniently limps out of his life while dispensing words of wisdom on dosage and how now, he has to keep taking the pill ""or else you'll die!"" His girlfriend tries the drug, pulls off some running/parkour that would impress Will Smith and Tom Cruise, but feels that, even after having, what I am assuming is superintelligent sex, that the drug is ""bad."" Her reason? Because it's not really you doing these things. Lame.
Why do the women always have to be typecast as voices of reason? Ghosts of Christmas Past rattling chains, yet at the same time, not really giving any actual lessons.

The anti-drug message of the film, which is just that the pills have a downside: Take too much and you'll black out while fighting multiple dudes on a subway--and where all those seemingly wasted hours zoning out on action movies and youtube videos actually pays off, and you just might actually kill a supermodel. None of this hits home as the murder is never resolved, and you're taught that moderation is they key.

The biggest downer, however, is the fact that by the end of the film, the message becomes that the benefits of having full use of your brain, still does not preclude acting like a total tool. Unimaginative writing propagates the already prevalent belief that above-average intelligence is really all about making loads of money quickly and getting a lot of punani. Oh, and becoming a US senator who will screw with people on a global scale.",1313366400,,2296,4.645320197044335

4525345,5,B0051MKMNC,"I liked this movie.  It is a fantasy, although there are resemblances to reality.  Bradley Coopers' character Edward has a writer's block and can't seem to make any progress on his book.  His brother in law gives him a drug that enables him to use 100% of his brain as opposed to 10% or 20%.  If the person was already intelligent, the drug enables the person to organize and access all information in his brain at will.  It also enhances creativity.

There aren't a whole lot of special effects, but the plot is interesting.  All of a sudden, this drug opens up a lot of possibilities for him that did not exist before.

It is hard not to notice parallels to reality with drug addicts: withdrawal symptoms, extra energy, heightened senses, and accelerated ageing of the body.

** SPOILER **
Toward the end of the movie, we learn that he used an enhanced version of the drug that did not have any side effects, and after a limited period of use, enabled him to use 100% of his brain without any further use of any drug.  In reality if such a drug was available, why would anybody not use it?  It seems to me like no-brainer, except if there was any *unknown* side effects to be discovered.

4525346,5,B0051MKMNC,"It's good news for the world that my local apothecary doesn't produce batches of these mind-enchancing pills. Because, no doubt about it, my end game would involve nothing less than total world domination. So it's maybe better all around that it's Eddie Morra what ends up with the almighty brain boost. Dude seems more altruistic.

As LIMITLESS opens, Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) - unfocused, unkempt, and rocking a despicable haircut and a sickly pallor - is getting dumped by his more successful girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish). Eddie is a writer suffering one of them horrid writer's blocks, and this is as kicked to the curb as he's ever felt. So who can blame him for ingesting a panacea to his woes - a top secret pill which supposedly unlocks 100% of one's brain power? (Well, yes, you can blame him; kids, don't do drugs, or whatever).

And the pill performs as advertised, a happenstance director Neil Burger couldn't wait for because, on cue, he lets loose his first salvo of hyperkinetic, ridiculously inventive visual effects, translating on screen what Eddie must've been experiencing as his IQ is uplifted (to four digits, natch). And, best believe, while Eddie is under the influence, his perspective shifts to that of a warped, sharper-imaged reality. The film's first half is crazy awesome as we track Eddie's segue from hapless slacker to motivated genius. Eddie now can access all the bits of information that have lodged in his brain down the years. And he does what you and I would do. He lives out his wildest fantasies. He tackles foreign languages and tricky math equations and sordid philosophy. He takes on Wall Street with a ferociousness even Gordon Gekko would admire. He even finishes that book, and it looks to be a best-seller. Now, women are easy gets, money accumulated with the alacrity of belly button lint, respect and admiration raked in like leaves on a lawn. Eddie's meteoric rise in high finance soon gets him eyeballed by a ruthless Wall Street baron (Robet DeNiro). And DeNiro's no match for our guy, providing Eddie keeps on digesting them smart tablets on a daily basis. It's sweet that Eddie would want to get back with his ex-girlfriend Lindy. You like him better for it.

And then the side effects begin manifesting. They aren't pretty. He begins suffering migraines and memory lapses. Director Neil Burger unveils a passage which breaks down one such memory skip, giving us a distorted quick edit taste of Eddie Morra's out-of-body experience. Maybe the best bit in there is when Eddie is accosted by thugs at a subway station, and Eddie uses memory aid gained from watching Bruce Lee films to whup some butt.

And there's a scary Russian gangster.

LIMITLESS is one of them films in which I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turns out to be a really good movie, a highly charged, twisty kind of escapism. Bradley Cooper had been in a bunch of ensemble casts; I think this is his first really lead role, and he doesn't waste the opportunity. He turns in a charismatic, self-assured performance. I think it's key that he's able to keep his character as a genuinely nice guy throughout the picture.

The third act comes off weaker as the plot degenerates to routine chases and  confrontations. And, honestly, the film lost some of its humanity when it went away from Eddie and Lindy's love story. However, the coda - featuring Bradley Cooper's final run-in with DeNiro - brought back the bravado. I'm not sure how faded Robert DeNiro is from his glory days, but I will say that he and Cooper provide some really watchable moments in their scenes together. Mostly, you can't peel your eyes away from LIMITLESS, with its outrageous premise, its imaginative style and high wire act, and its sheer swagger. It's probably okay to give Bradley Cooper more leading roles.

The DVD includes both the theatrical version and the Unrated Extended Cut of the Film.

Edward is going no where fast with his writing career until he runs into his ex-wife's brother who gives him a pill that gives him full access to his brain. The short term effects are great for Edward he's motivated, smart, and gets rich quick...however, like with any drug there are consequences. The action in this movie keeps you entertained and the plot twists are great.

I just have to say, for someone with ""limitless"" brain power, this guy made some pretty terrible decisions.  Probably the best part of the movie was discussing what we would have done with limitless potential once the movie was over.

4525352,3,B0051MKMNC,"I am not sure if I have seen a main storyline with more potential wasted.

So a person with limitless brainpower would use it to make money on Wall Street and run for politics? Really? The imagination of the writers were certainly limited, and that's too bad, because this film had its unlimited potential reach only about 5-20% of its capacity (depending on whom you believe).

This isn't a smart film. It is a trick; a gimmick with no real substance.

There are, however, few saving graces. Bradley Cooper (main character) is very convincing as an actor. I am convinced if he reaches 100% of his acting potential, he would be worthy of an Oscar, and he is far more than 20% there.

Before anyone tries to copy the concepts of this film and make yet an another script of enhanced-brainpower person making riches in Wall Street, then I suggest such person take more NZT 48 and enhance his/her own brain function first.

And how come the brother-in-law gets himself killed? Doesn't he know taking that pill will save his life from assasins? And how come he never gives it to those who want it? I mean it's for sale. Just sell it. But I suppose no one in the writing team has thought of that. More NZT 48 please.",1312761600,,1210,4.4818181818181815

4525355,4,B0051MKMNC,"""It works better when you're smart to begin with,"" (or something like that). This is one of the great lines in the movie and pretty much sums up the movie in one sentence although for me it goes more like this:
""The movie works better when you're not too smart to begin with,"" (or something like that).
The reason I say that is because first of all the initial premise of the movie i.e. you can utilize 100% of your brain is flawed. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we use only 10% of our brains. We already use 100% of our brains! The 10% statement may have been started with a misquote of Albert Einstein. If we didn't then we wouldn't have all these people that are crippled for life after a bullet to the brain or any other brain trauma for that matter since most of it isn't used anyways! Anyways, knowing this I still gave the movie a chance since it seems to be pretty popular so it must still be worth watching I figured.
And it is worth watching for the entertainment value it provides and the special effects.
I really dug how they did the drug effect's. Anyone who has come down off of a caffeine high, smokers high, or any other non natural drug should be able to relate to how Eddie Morra feels and the associated withdrawal of coming off drugs. Although, some of the effects did enter LSD/peyote territory with strange future like flashbacks.
The film did a pretty good job of portraying what it feels like to be considered highly intelligent. Like they say knowledge is power and it's just like in the movie when you are smarter than all those around you first of all your confidence it greatly improved. If someone is trying to kill you as we see with his girlfriend in the park you don't cry like a baby because you see 10 different ways to defend yourself using your brain and instantly jump into action. You become fearless to a certain degree. Intelligence will tell you in 9 out of 10 cases best thing is to run away. That is why the fight scenes with Eddie weren't realistic at all because even if he knew all the moves from reading or watching movies he would still need practice to skillfully execute the moves. It'd be like being able to read music and know how an instrument works doesn't mean you can actually play one! Learning multiple languages was not far fetched since he would have the memory recall and mental speed to pick it up quick. Once again he would not come off as smooth sounding as in the movie unless he lived in those countries learning the language because there are some things you just can't pick up in books. For example, when I lived in Japan I decided to learn the language from a book it was easy enough but when I went out in the street and actually talked to the Japanese they thought some of the stuff I said was funny or archaic since it's not used it everyday speech. I guess a  As we saw with Eddie at a cocktail party no topic is off limits because your superior intellect allows you to store tons of vast amounts of useless but entertaining information. It can come in handy sometimes though like with the law school girl in his apartment complex and yes you are able to recall information you've skimmed or seen on tv years ago although sometimes you do have to dig a bit and it may not be as accurate as portrayed in the movie. The again the thing with being highly intelligent is that others rarely question your information because their limited recall of facts and figures rarely allows them to dispute these vast stores of information in your brain. I didn't find the whole getting laid due to intelligence credible in real life but in the movie Eddie is not only good looking but intelligence so I guess it's a win win situation for him.
The other part I found believe and liked was how the movie showed that even though this guy is now super intelligent it doesn't mean he's going to take over the world nor does it even guarantee any sort of success at all. For example, just like in real life he has to go out and try to find someone willing to loan him some cash to really get his feet off the ground and if he was really smart I can't imagine him going to a shady person for it unless he did the risk/benefit ratio analysis beforehand and even then I don't think any benefit is worth getting cut at the waste as having your skin tied around your head as the Russian mafia guy mentioned. Also, later in the movie the DeNiro character mentioned gave him some wise advice and tried to show him intelligence is only a tiny part of the picture in being successfull in business telling him how backroom deals, networking, etc also play a big part.
Now the downsides to being smart is that you see flaws everywhere and this is how it ties in to this probably being a better movie for those that aren't too smart because first of all you'll fall for the 100% brain thing and think geez wouldn't it be cool to be supersmart? Yeah it can be cool at times like I mentioned but then there are the downsides like the flaws which you try to ignore but cannot since they stick out like a sore thumb. It's just like when Eddie was looking over the documents DeNiro handed him in the limo and right away he was able to see all the flaws and errors. So it's the same when watching the movie. They aren't too bad but the twists don't work too good though since you already know way ahead how things will end.*** SPOILERS ***
For example the lawyer stealing the pills out of coat.
Other mysterious guy coming out of nowhere also taking pill.
DiNiro character asking for favor.
The film started off strong and did pretty good at being consistent till near the end where it seems that the writer got in over their head and so they started inventing stuff to conclude it. For example, Eddie almost killed by Russian mob because he ran out of pills but someone at last minute he stabs guy and drinks his blood and saves himself. Don't know how they left this flaw in film since even Russian guy explained that shooting up drug more faster since it goes straight to brain. Licking it up off floor would be same as swallowing tablet! Even after all this Eddie shrugs off all deaths in apartment as done by previous tenants although if cops even did basic job they would find his blood prints on knife, etc. which would easily implicate him in murders!  And after all these questionable deaths surrounding him he's still able to get himself elected to the senate? Finally, biggest flaw in movie is that we saw earlier in movie that anyone taking the pill would have shortened life and yet he comes out that oh yeah I found a way to keep myself smart without using the pill which isn't fully explained. Then again that's more how real intelligence works there is no off switch like a pill. I guess you need to read the book as someone mentioned to fill in the gaps.
 Finally, primarily because of Western cultures lack of esteem for intellectual values, Eddie Morra wouldn't be so happy and tend to be unhappier than average. I mean he loses his girlfriend and doesn't seem any the sadder compared to the start of the movie!
Speaking of his girlfriend she seemed to be one of the more believable and sane characters in the movie. I mean she basically dumped him when he admitted he was doing drugs and didn't see anything wrong with that and using that to get ahead in life. Sort of like the recent string of steroid scandals. Looking back I guess some people could argue that the movie was just one big/long ad like those you see on television for anti-anxiety, viagra, etc.",1312416000,,7535,4.388412017167382
4525356,4,B0051MKMNC,What if you could advance the quality of your life by being super-smart/creative/talented with the aid of a pill?  What if the pill had deadly side effects and evil people wanted your stash?  This is an exciting and intriguing film with the talented Bradley Cooper in the lead.  He has an everyman quality that is relatable (although at times he seems a bit of a loser which makes the plot turns all the more interesting).  Abby Cornish plays the girl lead and she was great in this action thriller.  One of my favorite parts was her in the park at the rink - great action chops on her.  Would love to see her in more action films in the future.  I liked this film and found it exciting though at times there were some really scary parts.  Two thumbs up.,1312329600,,754,4.335714285714285
4525357,4,B0051MKMNC,"The film begins as Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is about to jump off the balcony of his very expensive and tightly secured living quarters. He begins to describe what led him to this extreme situation. The audience returns to when Morra's life has reached the bottom.
Morra is a slacker trying to write a novel while drinking and being lazy. He loses his girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), because she cannot take anymore of his behavior and laziness.
Morra was a former drug addict with an ex-wife who has a shady brother. Morra is vulnerable and willing to try anything, except self motivation, to improve his personal and professional life.
He takes a pill from his ex-brother-in-law. The drug allows one to access 100 percent of the brain. Now Morra can remember everything in his past from when he just glanced at documents to personal experiences.
He has the ability to comprehend information in a short period of time. With this new pill, life exceeds one's wildest dreams.
The pill is NZT, and it is to be taken once a day. Obviously, the drug is not FDA approved, so some very serious consequences happen from taking it.
Suddenly Morra, who does not know how to fight and is a mild mannered individual, becomes a person with exceptional mental powers. With his confidence and new found intellect, he begins to climb the ladder of success.
He completes his novel in four days. Before the pill he did not have one word written. The audience takes this trip with Morra as he runs the gauntlet of successes, and repercussions from the drug. Of course, along with taking the drug side effects begin to emerge.
Morra meets Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). Loon is a tough business man who is trying to negotiate a business deal with a large corporation. He sees the potential within Morra, so he begins to test his skills.
With all of the drugs people are taking today to sleep, wakeup, relieve pain, overcome depression, feel good, feel bad, and generally go through everyday activities, the pill Morra takes covers everything. However, do not get to excited, it has some very serious side effects.
Life always has its downside. Morra has problems with Russian bad guys, street gangs, and a mysterious lone assailant. Not to mention memory loss from the side effects of NZT.
The film is based on the book entitled The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn. It does have some very dark moments. One scene in particular demonstrates what a person will do in order to stay alive. Traveling in a dark field can be very dangerous. Not knowing what will happen next is an uncomfortable feeling.
However, for the audience it is entertaining and suspenseful. I recommend this film for anyone interested in watching an engaging and original story.
The audience takes the trip with Morra through some very precious moments. Lessons about drugs and how to handle success are dispersed throughout the film. With tense moments and a mystery waiting to be revealed the audience can take the journey without the side effects and consequences. Just enjoy the excursion without medication, but with a plot full of surprises and tense thrills.",1312329600,,3116,4.815298507462686
4525358,4,B0051MKMNC,"Last movie I watched was ""Limitless,"" that one where Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" et al.) takes a little pill and becomes unspeakably brilliant. I'd give this movie (in Amazon terms) 4 out of 5 stars.

As for the premise, it's not as insane (or cliched, even, I think) as you might guess. I thought that what would happen would be the typical ""Scarface""-ish, poor-hero-starts-from-bottom-makes-it-to-the-once-unimaginable-top-now-comes-crashing-down sort of plot, but really it seems that, despite what I'd say is the impossibility of this ever happening, realism sort of kicks in as soon as the protagonist in this movie gets into action. What I mean is, he starts having to deal with the consequences of his actions as soon as he gets rolling. He finds out pretty quickly that he's gotten involved with some pretty bad people. For example, the man he got the brain-and-senses-enhancing drug from is murdered a relatively short bit into the movie. The pill is dangerous on several grounds; not only does it become apparent that some other people want the drug and are willing to kill those that stand in their way in order to get it, the drug itself has some negative effects on its users. It's basically like heroin: you become very addicted to it very quickly; actually, the biological penalty for not getting more of the drug is death.

What also surprised me is that Cooper's character, for the meat of the movie, never really makes it to the top. He seemingly has the ability to do so, but he has to start off working for other people that have more money than himself. Cue Robert De Niro (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Meet the Parents"" and, like, everything else), who of course in his later years makes for a pretty intimidating presence, that is, in the protagonist's life. I.e. De Niro's given such a short amount of time on the screen that all in all I felt his inclusion was wasted. He's actually more dangerous-seeming in ""Meet the Parents"" than he is in this movie. I'm not unhappy that he was in the movie though; I just hope he doesn't become one of those actors who are given these short little bits in movies to provide the film with a little more class and seriousness. (Like Marlon Brando in his later years; it's just sort of the sad evidence that these really powerful stars are beginning to fade.)

The movie took some turns I wasn't expecting, like, for one, the foreign gangster who intimidates the main character into giving him some of the drug, which in turn makes him really powerful and dangerous for a time too. Didn't think his role was going to become that important, but it does. Um, what else. Oh, yes: Hollywood's gotten into this habit of starting the movie in medias res where the hero's on the verge of doing something drastic, at which point it goes back to show you how it all started. This is one of those movies, but for some reason the viewer knows it's not going to end as...ah, flatly...as it initially seems. One last point: all in all some pretty cool and perhaps mild seizure-inducing visuals in this film.

I really don't want to tell you this, but really the only way this movie disappointed me was the ending. It was one of those ""We can't really get out of this any other way, so let's just do this because it's safe"" endings. And honestly, it wasn't bad; it was seemed to have been stuck on rather hurriedly. At the same time, I can't really imagine how else it could have ended, or at least, what a better ending might have been.  (The DVD features an alternate ending which I haven't watched.)

In short, I think ""Limitless"" will entertain you for its entire duration.",1312070400,2,3649,4.67601246105919

4525367,4,B0051MKMNC,"The Movie
Going into Limitless I did not know what to expect. I saw the trailer and kind of brushed it off as I thought to myself it was probably just another average thriller, but this ended up being a nice pleasant surprise. Bradley Cooper has the star roll and does an excellent job. In fact, this might be his best acting gig yet. His performance makes the movie very enjoyable and fun. Now onto what the film is about... its about a man named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) who is a depressed man that is a writer and struggles to make a living. His life changes when he comes across his ex brother in-law from about 10 years ago when he slips Eddie a pill named NZT that may or may not change his life forever. The purpose of this pill enhances the brains ability and capacity to 100%. Eddie of course takes the pill and he soon finds out that it elevates his ability to think and do things which opens up great possibilities for him. The Movie takes some twist and turns that at points I do not think it could even keep up with them, however this is truly worth watching if not owning then renting.

Video Quality
This is a movie that MUST be seen on Blu-ray. We have 2 different looks to the film. One look as a cold, dull, dark and blue look to it while the other has a brighter look with somewhat elevated contrast. The scenes that Eddie is off the pill have the darker tone to it and the scenes when he is on the pill has the brighter look. While the brighter scenes do pop and look excellent, that does not mean that the scenes that are darker look bad. Strong detail and black levels are both exceptionally good in both parts. Moreover, the reason I mentioned that this film must be seen on Blu-ray is because of everything I just mentioned. The mood of the film depends on what exactly Eddie's mood is and we sort of follow him through a maze throughout the entirety of the film so to speak. Simply put, the experience here is quite awesome.

Audio Quality
The DTS-HD track is exceptional. Dialogue for the most part is handled very well, except for a few scenes where I felt it was a tad softer. The score of the film is also very good. Music and other sounds throughout the film can be heard clearly. The sound stage does a nice job at whatever is thrown at it.

Bradley Cooper, as ""Eddie Mora,"" was good in the lead and actually all the characters in the film were interesting. That includes the villains, who were credibly menacing.

Anyone who has been hooked on any kind of pill can relate to this film. The pill in this story, however, is different from anything anyone's heard of....and intriguing. You can't help but wonder if you would be tempted to take it yourself.

Co-starring with Cooper and his magic pill is the style of the film. It's very stylish and looks great on Blu-Ray. If you're into visuals, this is a good movie to check out. The same goes for fans of suspense.

That is where 99% of the fiction starts and stops - most everything else in the movie is very believable.  The pill doesn't make you fly, or levitate things, or read minds, it just lets you use 100% of your brain.  Imagine how smart you would be if you simply never forgot anything - even the stuff you didn't know you knew at all!  This movie lets you peek into that world.  It also shows how stupid you can be when you are so smart - the trouble the main character gets into could very easily be avoided (but then the movie would not be much to watch!).
The only disappointment was the ""Extended Cut"" - I didn't see much besides about 10 seconds of footage that added nothing to the movie.

""Limitless"" doesn't lean heavily on a ""message"" but it's there along with the consequences for the characters in the film for their action.

Director Neil Burger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000K7VHQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a>) does a terrific job of envisioning Eddie's world both with without the enhancement of the drug NZT-48 creating a thoughtful thriller that avoids being preachy.

""Limitless"" looks extremely good in Blu-ray with lighting, textures and colors for Eddie's different stages of mind nicely reproduced--it's a strong representation of what it looked like in theaters. Audio sounds extremely good as well with a nice immersive 5.1 lossless mix.

The Blu-ray includes an unrated version of the film that literally includes just a couple of extended scenes of graphic violence (and an injection). The film isn't hurt by the slightly longer scenes (clearly cut to gain the PG-13 rating). We also get some very nice extras as well including an
audio commentary with Director Neil Burger--Burger tends to describe what we're already SEEING (or about to see)rather than discuss his approach to the material and he clearly could have benefited from a moderator or cast member discussing the making of the film; ""A Man Without Limits"" focuses on bringing the character of Eddie to life and making him a convincing, sympathetic main character; ""Taking It To the Limit"" which gives us a bit of surprising info--the screenwriter OPTIONED the story herself--Leslie Dixon writes about what she saw in the original story that appealed to her and how she visualized telling the story. We also get (in under 15 minutes) a brief discussion of location shooting, stunts and other related information. The alternate ending isn't quite as strong as the one we see in the film (it's a variation on it just not as tight). We also get the theatrical trailer.

""Limitless"" is a well made entertaining popcorn thriller that has more substance than the average summer movie and that's to director Neil Burger's and writer Leslie Dixon's credit (as well as the actors). Burger who also wrote and directed the stylish ""The Illusionist"" does a great job with the material here.

Highly recommended.

Synopsis and spoilers below:

When slacker writer Eddie Mora (Bradley Cooper) runs into his ex-brother-in-law Vern (Johnny Whitworth)Vern opens a whole new world with the ""experimental"" drug NZT-48 that, incredibly, gives Eddie more insight, awareness of his surrounding, ambition, creativity and brilliance than he could ever imagine having. He can take on the stock market, deliver that brilliant first novel that he had his doubts about and make a fortune. The only problem is that others want the drug as well and will kill to get it as it isn't exactly legal nor is it in clinical trials for a variety of reaons as Eddie discovers. He also attracts the attention of Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro)a wealthy businessman who could be a threat to Eddie as well.",1311465600,5,3352,5.373333333333333

this would be a great series for one of the networks to pick up...and if a writer were to follow all of the heretofore unpursued angles presented in the film? i betcha they'd get an easy 2 or 3 seasons out of it without searching for new ideas.

no. i wouldn't recommend this film. as excited as i was to see it - it was a let down. but a whole lot of other folks liked it...",1311465600,8,929,4.184357541899441

Overnight you could be about anything you wanted because your ability to absorb would grow a hundred fold. That's the premise of the movie and it does a great job of showing us a story of a writer that can't seem to get his life on track and get his book going. In steps his brother-in-law from a marriage that failed in a chance street meeting. He gives him a gift of a drug as described not FDA approved or properly studied. Therefore the only problem is the lack of background on the long term affects. The pressure of the writers block makes his decision whether to try it easier.

Thirty seconds later he realizes he can recall anything he has read or seen and he can describe or do it with a Houdini like ability. He even has the ability to quickly learn languages. Not only does this attract the attention of those that can help him become successful in business, it attracts those that want a piece of whatever he has. In order to get ahead fast he has to borrow money and not from anyone he wants to owe anything. The movie is constantly going forward at a fast pace never looking back. He tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, but they are close behind and he must figure out who they work for and what they know. Even when he links up with a business tycoon he finds he is in competition for the spoils. Can he beat them at their own game? Will he survive long term usage of a drug that has killed several?

The idea that something, or some substance could bring hightened capability and focus to a human being interested me enough to want to go to the theater when it came out. I missed it, and had to wait for rental release. I am not disapointed. That idea did not loose momentum in the movie and delt with conceivable scenarios for those who used NZT-48.

In a nutshell, the protagonist starts taking a pill that drastically enhances his mental capacities and he becomes super smart/cool. One thing that makes this movie effective is that you feel like you are in the main character's shoes, experiencing everything right along with him.

I also appreciated the way that it ended, though it was a wee bit unclear (I won't spoil it for you). Frequently, movies that have powerful premises in the beginning tend to fizzle by the end, but this one didn't. It was great, and I loved the fact that I couldn't predict it.

4525389,5,B0051MKMNC,"Science fiction, action, and thrills work through a twisty plot finally to catapult Bradley Cooper into his rightful place as an actor who can hold a film equal with Robert DiNero. His grunge is as equally convincing as his brilliance (but, of course, his brilliant role shows handsome good looks to advantage and a good swoon to those who see).

The sci-fi premise is revealed in a clear pill that contains ingredients that enhance brain power from the basic 20% we use to 100%. Imagine! As a man who has wasted years of his life trying to write and living the rejected writer's life, he is given a pill that can literally give him a new lease on life. Is this pill approved by the FDA, as the provider promises? At this point, who cares? Eddie Morra (Cooper) certainly doesn't and in a very limited time space, gulps it. At the initial use of this synaptic pulse that ignites a dynamo, the landlord's wife is berating him for rent abuse. Director Neil Burger brilliantly reveals visually the course this synaptic bursts take from one point to the next in expanding Eddie's brain. Everything he has ever heard or seen or read are ordered into a seemingly limitless variety of ways that can help Eddie achieve.

And so he does. He writes that book, but in another moment of clarity, he sees the direction his life can take. Again, the director's message is that whatever personality traits a person has, that is where the drug reaches in to enhance. His girlfriend takes one pill to elude a strong-arm and learns that she has a sharp, scary side she does not want to revisit. Evil is personified through other characters who also take the drug. Eddie's ambition seems limitless. But then so do the after effects that the drug slams on the user

Other reviewers criticized what they saw as plot holes. I saw them as eccentricities in a story of man's chance to really do something significant. For significance is the final direction Eddie Morra takes. The film has one of those really satisfying, pleasing endings that the viewer cannot predict.

In a society in which women enhance their physical attributes, men enhance their sexual and athletic performances, ""Limitless"" asks us to study the effects of one man reaching the limits of his intelligence, and then some. It's a job well done: the movie, the performances, the visual effects, the action, the theme.",1311206400,3,2363,4.728155339805825
4525390,3,B0051MKMNC,"LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns.  The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue.

Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper attempting to break away from his guy roles in road show movies) is a wannabe writer - a man who has been attempting to write a novel for years but has not achieved one word on a page.  He lives off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who finally gives up on his mess of a life. Eddie moves into a filthy flat and he takes on the appearance of a street person until he encounters his ex-wife's (Anna Friel) brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who gives Eddie a pill called NZT, a medication that is purportedly able to make the brain use 100% of its capacity (fragments of memory, encountered headlines, books slightly read etc all become immediately available to the 'patient').  Eddie, seeing his life going down the toilet, takes the pill and suddenly becomes multilingual, able to figure out number sequences at the gambling table, not only start but finish his novel, etc: in other words, a genius - for the 24 hour duration of the pill's effect. His changed life introduces him to, of course, the stock market where he makes it so big that he garners the attention of  major player Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro) - along with the people involved with the now murdered Vernon  who want the drug back: evil Gennady (Andrew Howard) and his thugs (Eddie  Fernandez and Ray Siegle) a strange 'man in a tan coat' (Tomas Arana) et al.  Eddie struggles through the transition, sells his novel, wins Lindy back, and some years later is running for New York  Senator on his way to the Presidency of the United States.  And that of course leads to the messy ending that began the film.

Based on the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, the screenplay (full of holes perhaps due to the same writer's block as the main character's) is by Leslie Dixon and the film is directed by Neil Burger, a man with some creative ideas who concentrates on gimmicks more than plot and character development. And it does have some dazzling visual effects sequences, courtesy of Joe Willems, cinematographer and Connie Brink, Special Effects Coordinator. It is an obvious attempt to compete with the fast action films that make  so much box office money, but it is flimsy and may be better off in the DVD category - a category in which it landed early for obvious reasons.

The writer of this was obviously not on NZT, at least not the entire time. Maybe the first 1/3 of the film. While this film was engaging and interesting with a very good idea, it ultimately went nowhere and was not emotionally satisfying. A man suddenly becomes brilliant and needs to borrow money from the Russian mob = FAIL. a hundred grand is not a lot to raise and if you are brilliant, well, what's an extra week of trading to get the money. The mob aspect is where I was lost and the film never really recovered. He became brilliant and finished his novel in 4 days. As a creative writer myself I can tell you, unequivocally and without the need for NZT, that becoming a stock broker and then a politician is not an option or a goal. Creative people don't do that. The idea of day trading to make cash was plausible. Beyond that it was ridiculous, especially given the main character was presented as a creative type. I also still can not get past the poor writing of the need for the MOB to be in this film at all. The film seriously lost me the moment I saw the writing peek through when the day trading was working but not fast enough. C'mon! Why this films good idea needed to be watered down and reduced to mob men attempting to chase and kill the protagonist is beyond me. I was engaged but ultimately let down by a clever idea with a TV show presentation.

The long and short of it is that these persons allowed greed I suppose to really cloud their judgment and then had to deal with the consequences.

Every aspect of Limitless is interesting and creative.

The story follows a logical build up of its plot without holes or requiring the audience to take a giant leap of faith of plausibility. The casting was spot on, particularly Robert De Niro, who plays a heartless business tycoon. De Niro is at his very best in his supporting role.

The movie starts off with Bradley standing on a roof about to take his life and someone banging at his door. How did  he get there? The movie takes a huge ""mother may I"" step backward and we find out. Bradley, or Eddie in this movie is a divorced ""after two seconds"" sad sack writer who can't even get people to believe he has a book contract because he is so pathetic.

How do you make sexy Bradley Cooper look like he is pathetic? Well, give him crazy, lackluster, long hair and don't let him smile because it will crinkle and brighten his sexy blue eyes. Eddie is a slob who can't pay his rent, or come up with a sentence for his book until he runs into his ex-junkie-brother-in-law.

He can recall things he doesn't even remember, everything he ever read, things that he only saw but didn't even realize it had imprinted on his brain. He learns to play the piano in 3 days. He can speak any language. He suddenly knows everything about everything.

He heads back to his brother-in-laws for more drugs. The BIL tells him he knew he would be back and that he needs to get his cleaning and some lunch for him and he will give him the drug. When he gets back his BIL is sitting on the couch after being shot in the head and the apartment is trashed. He calls 911, searches for the drugs and has a lot of explaining to do.

The drugs change Eddie's life. He is back with his ex girlfriend, he is successful, has tons of cash and everyone is interested in him. Sounds great but his new fans are good and bad people. Eddie's stalkers want the drug and want him dead.

The Film 4/5

Eddie Morra (Cooper) is a loser. He looks like he sleeps on the streets and his girlfriend is his main source of income while he struggles to write a novel. He lives in a seedy apartment and is more likely to be eating pizza and drinking alcohol than working on his book. His girlfriend (Cornish) finally decides it's time to leave, but Eddie's life is about to change for the better.

In a chance meeting with Vernon, the brother of his ex-wife, Eddie is offered a pill. He's suspicious because Vernon was dealing drugs the last time the two met. After thinking about it, Eddie decides that life can't get much worse and takes the pill. Within 30 seconds, he starts to feel different. The color palette changes from dull and muted to bright and clear and represents the change in Eddie.

We are told that we use a fraction of our brain on a daily basis. The pill is supposed to enable us to use one hundred percent of our brain. Eddie finds that he can think clearly and work out solutions to difficult problems. He writes a book in four days without pausing to think how the plot should progress and his editor loves the result. We see him learn how to play piano and become fluent in the Italian language.

Eddie feels like he suddenly knows everything.

It's interesting how a positive mental attitude can change your life. Instead of living like a slob, he cleans his apartment. Then he focuses on ways to use his intelligence to make enough money to permanently change his life. His new confident attitude attracts the girlfriend who dumped him. Eddie's life is starting to look pretty good.

After making the news with a series of shrewd investments, Eddie attracts the attention of Carl Van Loon (De Niro). Van Loon is an ambitious businessman who craves money and power. He has no time to waste on losers, but gives Eddie a chance to impress. He reminds me of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street.

Eddie's main problem is securing a regular supply of pills. He also has to adapt to their effects and discover a way to moderate his reaction. Like any drug, there are side effects to deal with. I won't reveal anything else, but the plot is more complicated than I have made it sound.

The movie is advertised as an action thriller and Rolling Stone describes it as a ""Full-tilt adrenalin rush."" Although there some action scenes, I wouldn't describe it as an adrenalin rush. There are chase scenes, but the focus is on Eddie's fortunes and there's always an element of mystery. I found it enjoyable because I wanted to see what would happen next, but I rarely found myself sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation.

The acting is good across the board. Cooper pulls off his role well. He's serious when he has to be and whimsical in the lighter scenes. De Niro doesn't get a great deal of screen time, but his scenes are memorable. Cornish is effective as Eddie's girlfriend.

I found Limitless to be an enjoyable way to spend 105 minutes. There are two versions included on the Blu-ray; the theatrical and the unrated extended version. There is only a few seconds difference in running time between the two.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Limitless looks very good on Blu-ray. Detail is strong throughout, although we see more during scenes where Eddie is feeling the effects of the drug. Contrast and brightness are boosted during such scenes. Although the other scenes appear drab by comparison, there's good detail and no problem with the transfer. Most viewers will be pleased with the look of the movie.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is more than adequate. The action scenes are limited, but the track delivers when needed. Dialogue is crisp and clear and I didn't detect any problems with the sound. The commentary track uses English: Dolby Digital 2.0.

Special Features 2.5/5

The additional features all appear in full HD.

Audio Commentary with Director Neil Burger.

A Man without Limits (4:29)

Taking it to the Limit: the Making of Limitless (11:38) - It would have been nice to see a more extensive feature.

Alternate Ending (5:14) - I prefer the original ending, but it's nice to see another possibility.

Theatrical Trailer (2:25)

Limitless has a few plot holes, but it works as a piece of entertainment. Cooper does a great job as Eddie and you'll want to see him succeed. It's hard to pin down the genre as it includes mystery, drama, action, sci-fi and comedy, but it's more of a thriller than anything. I didn't see the film in the theater, but I'm glad it found its way into my Blu-ray collection. It won't change your life, but few people will regret seeing it.

4525401,3,B0051MKMNC,"Just got back from a 12 hour flight where I saw this on the plane. I also enjoyed it quite a bit too. I teach psychology and like the brain pill idea to make you smarter and I like the character changes. I am would have like more explanation (even if it was pseudo-science of course and how it works and especially the after effects/side effects). Overall, the movie was gripping but my biggest problem is for someone that is suppose to be so very very hyper intelligent on the drug, why did he (and the others on it) make so many mistakes? SPOILERS COMING...............................................................................................................

-why not get advanced knowledge in chemistry early and learn how to make the drug himself before running out, and improve on it early too?
-with all the money he was making, why not pay off the Russian RIGHT AWAY, that would have really helped him
  -and there's more of these things
-also, why doesn't his super secure apartment have an alarm hooked to the police of a cell phone call would have done it, duh.

anyway, would love to hear comments if you're still reading as this means you probably watched it already.",1309996800,31,1187,4.949748743718593
4525402,4,B0051MKMNC,I just finished watching this movie so its fresh in my head. I have to say i have been a Bradly cooper fan from wedding c rashers.  This is the kind of movie allot of us can relate to a guy going from having nothing to alot of something. I am not a big drug user fan i like the concept. I think that some one that smart would have not done some of the things that he had but hey that's a movie and it leaves u with a what if ending so i would say def a good guy flick your girl friend might be hitting u on the arm asking whats going on every fiv mins lol,1309910400,,555,3.625
4525403,5,B0051MKMNC,"Imagine if you could take a drug that makes you smarter, more eloquent, better in every respect.  Imagine if the more you took the drug, the better you became.  You're still you, you're achieving your your full potential, not the slacker we all secretly fear we are. That's the plot of Limitless.

Edward ""Eddie"" Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer some potential, enough potential to get a book advance, but not enough to actually write it.  Wallowing in self-doubt after his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) breaks up with him, he bumps into the brother of his ex-wfe. Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth) slips Eddie an $800 gift in the form of a little translucent pill, NZT-48. Bored and frustrated with his life, Eddie turns to the drug and bangs out 40 amazing pages of his new book in three days.

Things go south when Vernon ends up dead, leaving behind his stash of the illegal NZT. It's a drug addict's dream: an endless supply with no side-effects. Or is there?

It turns out everyone is secretly using NZT and prolonged use kills people. With enough drugs to keep him clear for a long time, Eddie focuses his brilliant intellect on trying to figure out how to beat the drug's side-effects.  Along the way he will try to win his ex back, get an amazing job with a ruthless executive (Robert DeNiro as Carl Van Loon), and fight off the criminal underworld (Andrew Howard as Russian thug Gennady) who wants a piece of the action.

Limitless is like a sci-fi version of Trainspotting - it glamorizes, then demonizes, then glamorizes drug use with a futuristic sheen that makes it palatable to modern audiences. The movie's ending stays true to the title...or does it?

See, Limitless is a drug addict's tale told by a drug addict, a narrator reminiscent of Fight Club.  You can't trust a single thing he says, even as he confides in how he conned everyone else - except for you.  Of course.  But there is a price, and for those who pay attention, it's clear that NZT does extract a price: your soul. That ending elevates Limitless from a crowd-pandering trifle like Crank to a thoughtful meditation on what it means to achieve your full potential at any cost.",1309910400,,2161,4.657894736842105
4525404,4,B0051MKMNC,"""Limitless"" belongs to the group of films that explore the effects of medication/drugs on human behavior, the most famous of which is, of course, ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde."" The best version of Jekyll/Hyde was the 1920 version with John Barrymore, but the idea is so striking that it is one of the most filmed of all of Robert Lewis Stevenson's novels.

Other films that deal with this topic include ""Charly"" (1968), ""Awakenings"" (1990), and  ""The Lawnmower Man"" (1992). Intelligence enhancing drugs and their side effects have also be featured in TV's ""Lois and Clark"" and in ""Dune"" (1984).

The central theme in all of these films is that whatever progress can be made comes as a cost, and the protagonist usually is seduced into the experiment without full knowledge of the long term consequences. The key point comes when the person realizes the trade off and then must decide how to proceed. Sometimes the decision is not left up to the person (e.g., ""Charly"", ""Awakenings""), although even in these circumstances the person can choose how to accept the consequences even if he is unable to alter them.

""Limitless"" is a nice addition to this small group of films, although it tends to blend the illegal with the legal, which I think is an unnecessary addition. The hero, Bradley Cooper, gives a fine performance as the man who slowly comes to learn that his enhanced abilities come at a cost. Cooper is best known to us from his years as the investigative reporter on TV's Alias (2001-6) and from ""The Hangover"" films (2009, 2011).

Robert de Niro puts in a brief appearance as an influential businessman and investor who wants Cooper's services as well as access to the miracle drug he uses. Cooper is also dogged by a Russian thug played amusingly by Andrew Howard. The real scene stealer is Anna Friel as Cooper's ex sister-in-law who was one of the first subjects to experiment with the drug.

The film moves at a quick pace under the steady hand of Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Interview with the Assassin""). It's enhanced by the fine acting from everyone involved. This film may not be on the same level as ""Jekyll/Hyde"" nor even ""Charly"" and ""Awakenings"" (that also starred de Niro), but it is an entertaining film.",1309564800,,2229,4.791666666666667
4525405,4,B0051MKMNC,"This is an interesting movie.  Credit also goes to the editor(s) that created the enticing trailer, which got me interested in the movie.  The story would have been more engaging with additional emphasis on (1) the subsequent re-creation / re-supply of the NZT pill and (2) the mind expansion and its relevance to the Eddie's life.

In conjunction with the enticing trailer, there is an elaborate marketing strategy for this film on the internet which ""advertised NZT"".  For those who enjoyed this movie (like me), check out this cleverly done website for the movie [...].  The creation of this website should have been part of the movie.

Personally, the Russian characters are a TOTAL WASTE of time and should have been removed from script.  In turn, more emphasis should be made on how Eddie's chemist enhanced NZT,  how Carl (Robert Deniro's character) gets cornered or defeated entirely by Eddie's new NZT and how NZT eventually gets marketed as a 'legal' drug.

To me, the movie was too short and did not elaborate enough on matters pertaining to brain function enhancement and the impact it brings to a person's life.",1309478400,,1124,4.904761904761905

4525408,5,B0051MKMNC,"Spoiler Alert!
Okay, this movie was made awhile back before Bradley Cooper was the current hot shot he is today. I love him. This is NOT a Bradley Cooper gets the girl movie!!! He is one of the two guys going after the main chic in this flick. I'm a big movie goer/watcher yet I know that I don't know all that goes into a movie. But I do know this... this was a cheap movie. The acting is bad. The music, horrible! And the only thing that would make the plot tolerable is if one of the men actually got the girl in the end. Sorry!!! I was excited when I saw a Bradley Cooper movie listed on my Amazon Video on Demand. I hadn't heard of it??? I looked it up on the best website out there, IMDb. Not a whole lot there. In fact at the time, there wasn't even one rating. But the trailer was there. So, I watched it. Hmmm, I thought? Looks pretty good. Looks funny. Well of course, the only good parts are shown in the trailer. I know I sound harsh. I'm sorry. Believe it or not, I give most movies a pretty good rating. Really! And no offense to Bradley Cooper, because, yes, I do love you!!! But I believe this movie was only released on DVD because he's a star now. If you haven't seen LIMITLESS, you must. It's amazing!!! So, just to sum this up, please don't waste your time and money watching this movie... you don't even get to see a bare butt :)",1307145600,,1350,4.078947368421052
4525409,4,B0051MKMNC,"Limitless has a fascinating premise: what if there was a pill that would make you smarter. Of course it's not that simple; the film does raise some good moral questions about such a pill and its consequences, and I would've like to have seen that avenue explored a bit more. The performances are adequate, and Robert DeNiro has a few good stand-out scenes. The plot is paced fairly well and a few actions scenes are peppered in for good measure, but what you'll likely enjoy most about this film are the conversations you'll have with your friends afterward.",1306713600,,558,4.704081632653061
4525410,5,B0051MKMNC,"I was taken in by the opening credits as an outline of a brain turns into a city. I am a big sucker for that microcosm/ macrocosm stuff.

Edward has writer's block. He has a book contract for some reason, yet hasn't written a word. His girlfriend, who was his meal ticket leaves him. Bummed out he decides to go live on a bunk bed at Dad's place in New Jersey, but then bumps into his ex-brother-in-law, who is a drug dealer. He offers Edward a pill that increases a person's use of their brain. They can recall everything they have seen or read and can correlate it to increase intelligence. The smarter a person is to begin with, the more data they have to work with. Edward is a smart guy to begin with, so he is able to start his book. The downside is that the pill wears off. Not only does one lose the abilities, but they get a little ADD, and throw up like a heroin addict. Too much of the pill causes a Mr. Hyde type of character including blackouts. Edward's supplier is murdered and Edward finds his stash of pills and a wad of cash.

Edward uses his ability to make money on Wall Street. He catches the attention of big time corporations as well as the Russian mafia. He quickly finds out people who take the smart pill eventually die from either taking too much or running out. Edward must try to balance his life.

I loved the concept. I loved how they did the drug effect with simple but effective camera tricks. Anyone who has come down off of cocaine, LSD, or heroin knows how Edward feels and he portrays a man coming off drugs very well.

I even liked the ending, although the last few minutes should have been stretched out. No nudity.",1306540800,261,1654,4.291666666666667
4525411,5,B0051MKMNC,"I just saw this film for the 2nd time in theaters.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD and share it with friends who have missed it on the big screen.  Unlike the previous reviewer I do not have a history of drug use/abuse so I don't get the big negatives with regard to showing the fantasy life the main character is creating.  This is FICTION. It is a great FICTIONAL story and like MOST fiction it has some basis in truth.

The camera work is great, and yes the technique has been used before but it is still a great ride. I love the way the story unfolds. The one scene that made the whole audience in the theater nearly scream out ""NO NOT THAT"" is just pure crazy, unadulterated insanity, and sorta fun/gross !!!  You will know it when you see it.

I hope people who saw the film and buy the DVD will appreciate this story for the suspense, action, camera work, and unexpected moments.  Movies don't always have to be about a positive message......how about imagination and just delirious fun?  Two Thumbs UP!!!",1306281600,25,1020,4.331578947368421
4525412,2,B0051MKMNC,"This is a drug film. It came across as a not even thinly veiled ode to the greatness of Methamphedamine (Speed) and/or Cocaine. Its compleatly unashamed in its message and it doesn't take one step back from it all the way to the end. The message is that drugs are great and that all the risks can be managed by a smart addict. All the scifi aspects of the film do is serve to exaggerate the real-world boost of drugs.

All the hallmarks are here. The world becomes brighter when the drug is taken. He goes and parties continuously for days. He can crank out work. He suddenly starts cleaning his apartment compulsively in the middle of the night. he forgets to eat. He does damage to his body. He has blackouts. His woman friend who was on the drug for a long time is now prematurely aged. We even get the guys drug dealer disguised as a high-interest loan shark. And you get large numbers of contemporaries dying. There is even all the addict paranoia about hiding and losing a pile of drugs. They also have him so in love with his drugs that he literally licks them off the floor.

And best of all, they use two professions in the film where drug use is rather common (wall street and writers).

But what the film gets wrong is that drugs don't make people smarter or teach them foreign languages instantly. They speed you up and give you limitless energy and make you more confident. You can get more done, but not because your smarter. But because you can work 2x to 3x longer.

Where the film falls down is in showing the long-term price. It didn't show his body wearing out. It didn't show the paranoia or the teeth falling out. It didn't show that as drug use goes on you get diminishing returns. You may be able to crank out pages in a book, but they cease to be good pages. They also miss the costs of not being able to properly sleep.

On the positive side, right up to the happy ending its probably one of the best films I can think of in capturing the deluded mentality of a new heavy drug addict. But its not generally a good message to be out pushing. And the film doesn't capture at all what happens in the long term.

The plans of the main character are fairly lame. He wants to get rich on wall street and the become president. Why? He has a plan to make everything better. And typical of drug logic, we never find out what that plan is. I also don't remember if we ever found out if he had or had not killed a woman during a blackout. But he clearly is involved in the murder of a lawyer for messing with his stash.

I could have lived with the film minus the happy ending. But ending it in the way they did made a pro-drug film.

Robert De Niro is in the film basically doing a character actor role as the big man on wall street. Its a completely workmanlike performance. His name on a film still sells tickets but you really wonder how many times can get away with it putting his name on something he has no personal investment in.

Somebody came up with a new continous zoom effect for the film. Its an interesting effect and it communicates well to the viewer the sense of being trapping at full speed thats at the heart of the film. Its maybe used a little too much and they pulled it out way too early. But it was a nice original touch.

The film is essentially told from the narrative point of view of the main character. Bradley Cooper pulls it off well. His girlfriend is basically a prop character.

Technically and in terms of acting, its a good film. But the script and its message are rather questionable.

-----
Postscript:

The alternate ending available on the DVD/BD is an improvement on the original. Rather than having him get everything for *free*, the alternate ending makes it clear that nothing has changed and he is still ruled by drug logic. As he himself says at one point, the answer to the drug is the drug. the drug will tell him how to get better or get off the drug. To me the ending as much as says that the spiral downward he has been on in the second half of the film will only continue. The alternate ending seems much truer to the overall concept of the film.

The audio commentary is interesting. The final ending was apparently supposed to present more ambiguity than IMO it did. We were supposed to wonder if all his talk at the end was an enormous bluff. Though that seems to have been the intentions, what they did ultimately in my opinion didn't push that message. And the ""dinner"" ending undercut any ambiguous ending.

The extras are not all that interesting. There is a uesless thing which seemed to be about how great Bradley Cooper is. Its only virtue was that it was short. The ""making of"" extra was rather odd in that while it talked about some effects, it had nothing at all to say about the infinite zoom effect which was one the signiture bits in the film. There is some interesting stuff about how the shot different parts of the film on different film stock (before and after the drug). But it could have been better.",1306281600,20,4989,4.326552462526767
4525413,4,B0051MKMNC,"Unique & Original? Not soo much, but its still very watchable and easy to get into. I found the cinematography quite similar to Gaspar Noe's ""Enter The Void"" but still not quite as mesmerizing as Noe's work. The colors were bright and quite nice to look at I might add. The zoom motion that the film begins with and continues to do throughout the film is what I found most similar to Enter the Void. Anyone who enjoys watching trippy types of films (i.e. pi, requiem for a dream, eyes wide shut, fight club, donnie darko) I feel you'll enjoy this one as well.

Entertaining? Yes, I'd say so..The movie picks right up and does not really let go of you once its started. The story is interesting, the visuals are nice to look at and what Cooper's doing is pretty sweet most of the time. There are thrills, suspense, fights and all. There is a hint of a romantic relationship with Bradley Cooper's girlfriend, but not much side stories in this film, which could do both good and bad to the film. You be the one to decide how you feel about it..

Does it leave you hanging? In my opinion, yes. I feel the movie realized it was pushing an hour and forty five minutes and that they should wrap it up soon. I honestly would've rather had an extra ten or fifteen minutes so the story could be cleared up. I felt once De Niro and Cooper were starting to collide, the film was over. I really don't prefer to add spoilers to my reviews therefore I won't start, but if you go see the film after reading my comment I'd say just keep in mind...""Does this provide adequate information and answer everything"" Who cares, Go see the movie..

I hope I've been helpful...

 This movie definetly overdeliverd my expectations, and if you have a imagination you will appreciate the plot and how Bradley Cooper uses being limitless to his maximize his potential, but of course like every great movie there has to be a so called bad guy (Di Niro) and Cooper and Di Niro had great on screen chemistry. This movie is filled with twists and turns all over a pill that lets Cooper use 100% of his brain and of course what will happen when the pills run out??

Regarding the film: it's a very rare commodity in Hollywood these days.  No ecological warnings, no CGI, no dismal theme.  It's simply a very good story told in a masterful fashion.  The lead character is a writer in NYC.  He is intelligent and very talented, but struggles with a number of personal demons.  As a result he lives in virtual poverty and his long-suffering girlfriend is ready to dump him.

Then he's given a cutting edge drug by a ""friend"" that is supposed to increase cognitive functioning.  He takes it on a whim and as a result his life turns around totally.  He finishes a brilliant novel in record time, earns a fortune in the stock market, and makes the acquaintance of a number of beautiful and wealthy people.

Deniro plays the role of a financial power broker eager to exploit the young man for his mental abilities.  In addition there'a an anonymous assassin trying to kill him, a Russian mobster to whom he owes a substantial amount of money, and the drug's side effects, all working to derail his plans for success.

All of that changes after a chance encounter with his former brother-in-law Vernon Gant (played by Johnny Whitworth) who he hasn't seen in 9 years. His brother-in-law is a drug dealer and gives him a pill that enables one to access all of the mind's potential. The pill is an experimental drug called NZT-48. Whereas before you would only be using 10% of your brain now you would be using all of your brain. And this miracle drug changes Eddie's life, transforming him into a genius with hitherto unknown levels of motivation: in 4 days he finishes the book he has been trying to write for months, charms the landlord's wife so he doesn't get thrown out of his apartment (and sleeps with her), learns how to fight from recalling martial arts movies he saw on TV, lands a job as a stockbroker, gets back with his girlfriend, starts making new and wealthy friends, starts appreciating (and finding useful) mathematics, discovers he can quickly learn anything he puts his mind to and gains an appetite for culture. But all is dependent on the pill: when the effects of the pill wear off he goes back to being the old Eddie. Eddie has a stash of the NZT-48 pills because he retrieved them from Vernon's apartment after discovering that he had been murdered shortly after they met. But now the same people that killed his brother-in-law are after him because they want the drug. And NZT-48 has side-effects: Eddie has been having black-outs, spells of dizziness and even vomiting, perhaps because he has been taking too much of the drug. But Eddie is ambitious and wants to make his mark on the world. He cannot stop taking the drug. He wants to invest money but the banks won't lend so he borrows $100,000 from a Russian gangster / loan shark who threatens to `flay him alive' if he doesn't repay. When he meets with his ex-wife Melissa Gant (played by Anna Friel) who informs him that she used to also take NZT-48 and it nearly killed her, Eddie must decide: is risking his life worth becoming limitless? Furthermore an important business deal for business mogul Carl Van Loon (played by Robert De Niro) who he works for is in danger of going belly-up, and Eddie needs this deal to succeed if he is going to get to where he wants in life. And when the Russian gangster that lent him money comes to collect and gets Eddie's last NZT-48 pill off of him and takes it and becomes a genius himself, Eddie's life just might be forfeit because the gangster wants more of the drug and will kill Eddie if he doesn't get it. Will Eddie survive all of these challenges and achieve his goals? A most enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. The film is not perfect however: for instance where the NZT-48 drug comes from is never explained, it doesn't make sense that Eddie is the ultimate genius but doesn't think to make sure that he pays back on time the loan he owes to a vicious loan shark / Russian gangster, we do not see how Eddie lands a stockbroker's job and hence ends up working for Robert De Niro's character Carl Van Loon and the ending of the film is a bit contrived.

8452860,3,B0051MKMNC,"Enjoyed the movie, works fine in my PS3, others haven't been so lucky with their players. With that said, along with other reviewers, I'm pretty sure this is a knock off. Something seems off, can't put my finger on it. Also, the case has ""Digital Copy"" sticker on the cover, yet the case held only the disc and not a single piece of paper. I always add my videos to my iTunes collection and the number wasn't included. Another reason I believe this is a knock off. Order at your own risk.",1526601600,,488,4.315217391304348
