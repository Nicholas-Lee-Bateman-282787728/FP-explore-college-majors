7823694,2,6302275865,"Bikini Island is your typical low budget T & A killer flick, with plenty of excuse to put women in skimpy bathing suits and make them do ridiculous poses. The characters in the film are amazingly stupid in not  noticing that something fishy is going on. But don't blame them, blame the  scriptwriter. The most ridiculous death scene--- some guy suffocated by a  plunger while he was in the shower. Is that possible!  Anyway have the  remote handy so you can speed the film up to get to the good parts. The  ending was absolutely ridiculous....it trivializes all the killings that  went on.",957916800,3,589,4.660194174757281
