7203815,3,B00XZBXV48,I'm torn between 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  I like the way this documentary provokes thought.  It's amazing how they finesse the art of bluffing and confidence.,1435017600,,152,4.592592592592593
7203836,5,B00XZBXV48,"Worth every penny and while it may be available to watch elsewhere, these guys are worth every penny of support they get.",1461024000,,121,4.545454545454546
7203837,3,B00XZBXV48,"Although I have read plenty of positive reviews of this third film by the Yes Men, my opinion is that it is depressing as it has become obvious that they feel that their efforts to make a difference over the years has actually not resulted in anything other than three entertaining DVDs. Their attempts to use art and creativity to engender social change has generally failed to result in any long term change. So, basically, their efforts were fun and clever, but the big guys appear to have won. Watching the first two Yes Men films, I felt inspired and optimistic that smart, clever, socially progressive people can have a positive effect on the world and cause real change. Watching this one just left me depressed and feeling like big business is basically impenetrable.",1461024000,,775,4.791044776119403

7203839,5,B00XZBXV48,"I love both of the previous Yes Men films, but this one is by far the best.  It's more real and human, and it feels even more desperate to preserve the this great nation (and the world) than the previous films!  There are scenes from the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as protests against the World Trade Organization, and more Shell exposure than ever before.  Must see!",1456704000,2,377,4.514705882352941

7203842,5,B00XZBXV48,I've always been highly amused by the antics of The Yes Men. Sort of seems more absurdist performance art than pure political activism. But that's a nice by-product of a very entertaining duo.,1454976000,,192,4.848484848484849

7203847,4,B00XZBXV48,"These guys have been around for quite a long time, and I find it surprising that nobody in a position of responsibility recognizes them - that's okay; their ignorance is our entertainment gain.  Great job guys!",1449360000,2,210,4.833333333333333

7203850,3,B00XZBXV48,If you have seen any of the other Yes Men movies then you know what to expect. It's a little different in that it desks a lot more with their relationship to each other and their history. It's good but not sitting to rave about. It's not for everyone but those of us who like this type of movie we'll still enjoy it.,1449100800,,316,4.031746031746032
7203851,3,B00XZBXV48,I lasted about 3/4 of the way through this - it's okay -I just found myself in the same mindset as one of the Yes Men -is any of it changing anything?,1449100800,,150,3.71875
7203852,5,B00XZBXV48,I appreciate the work and the imagination they put into that work.,1449100800,,66,4.583333333333333

7203886,1,B00XZBXV48,"Didn't make it all the way through. Other than a few somewhat entertaining antics thrown at the government and big business, I found the movie to be quite boring.  We might not agree with the government or the tactics of big business, but they are two things a civilized, free, open market society needs in order to function. Kudos to a few of the bazillionaires they have a conscience and give back (Gates and most recently Zuckerberg).",1449014400,,437,4.675324675324675

7203889,4,B00XZBXV48,"The thing I love best about this movie is that we got to see two lifelong activists (The Yes Men) struggling with burnout.  After years of trying to draw attention to real and important issues with globe-spanning ramifications and not really making any significant change, both were seriously considering just throwing in the towel.
And then the Occupy movement happened.
Now...you can argue as to the effectiveness of that movement, or its viability in the long term, but one thing is clear.  Increasingly, We, the People, have had ENOUGH of business as usual.
The existing system has an enormous amount of inertia behind it, so it would be folly to expect to see radical, overnight change...but the movement that started post-recession hasn't gone away.  It is as active and vibrant as ever, and the reverberations OF that movement are beginning to be felt.  It may be years...perhaps even decades before we see true, fundamental change, but that change is inevitable.",1448928000,4,970,5.04375
7203890,1,B00XZBXV48,I watched about 15 minutes of this garbage but I instantly knew this couldn't of been made by 2 broke guys who cared about me and the environment. People need to wake up and look into agenda 21wich is going to be a new way for the government and banks to imprison and control the population by telling you they are keeping us from killing the planet with no scientific proof. Watch if you must but realize your being terrorized with fear of a dieing planet.,1448668800,2,457,4.325581395348837

7203909,1,B00XZBXV48,"I enjoyed the film as comedy, the attic ice shelf has been proven to be growing, there are now more polar bears than ever.  I find it interesting that liberals and environmental groups have to resort to glass and outright lies to push their agenda.",1447545600,,248,4.511111111111111
7203910,1,B00XZBXV48,I haven't actually seen the film but only because the video quality was awful. I've not had this problem with Amazon streaming before but after trying to watch the film twice I'm wondering if the problem relates to this title. I'll be trying again.,1447459200,,248,4.659090909090909
7203911,4,B00XZBXV48,"You aren't going to watch many movies that are worth more than this one.  Hey, it has substance!  And is reasonably entertaining; there are some profound moments, some laugh-out-loud moments.  I'll never forget the sight of the tar sands in Canada.",1445472000,,248,5.0
7203912,4,B00XZBXV48,"a little slower and more introspective than the other Yes Men movie I watched years ago, but equally inspiring. I LOVE these guys and their brand of activism. My favorite scene is a joint collaboration with a Canadian indigenous activist. Watch and see!",1442102400,3,253,4.906976744186046
7203913,2,B00XZBXV48,Too much personal story behind the two yes men.  Obvious tension between the two really detracted from what I thought the point of the movie was which is how terrible the government is.  It was more of,1441238400,,201,4.405405405405405
7203914,5,B00XZBXV48,"This movie is as excellent as the other two, a must see for anyone engaging in serious, yet playful non-violent social actions to fight an unjust social order.  What I especially liked about this movie, however, in contrast to the others is how they portrayed how their social activism interfered with their personal and family lives, a point often neglected in discourse on non-violent social action strategies.  Where one puts their energies to work for social justice is an extremely personal issue, often impacting a person's loved ones.  I also liked how one evening one of the main characters of the film each commented in a very human way on his jealousies and the other one commented on his hypocrisy around eating meat.  Viewing the film, I could not help but think of Gene Sharp's 198 Non-Violent Social Actions, where he mentioned one of them being ""pranks.""  I am not sure what role Gene Sharp had in their social activism, but certainly the pranks they played were courageous, worth emulating, and quite effective.",1439078400,4,1027,4.913294797687861

8717131,4,B00XZBXV48,"I really had to stretch to give this 4 stars, but I really enjoyed the concept of theater activism and the more concise parts of the film were very good.  Otherwise, it meandered around a lot and took up time.  Did we need the bit about the new baby?  No, it didn't relate to anything and a quick shot of the event would have sufficed.  This film was a missed opportunity to really get their message across and gave the opposition reason to criticize it.  I wish more filmmakers would think about what image they are giving the other sides in these matters.  They already demonize anyone like crazy, which is the American way to silence dissidence.",1488844800,,648,4.495726495726496
