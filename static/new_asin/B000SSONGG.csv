8206582,5,B000SSONGG,"In the film ""Double Deal,"" Tommy McCoy and ""Dude"" Markey are in love with Harlem singer/dancer Nita. Markey robs a jewelry store and turns the loot over to gang-boss Murray Howard. Later, Markey robs the safe, in order to get rid of his rival for Nita, frames the robbery on McCoy. The latter's big brother thinks otherwise, and with Nita's help, sets out to prove it. Mistaken Identity"" was first titled ""Murder With Music"" in 1941. The beautiful Nellie Hill has many admirers, but when one of them gets killed all the others are suspected. All this among some great singing and dancing, some great songs and bands. This is a showcase for African-American entertainment in the early 1940s. Getting both films on s single DVD is a ""double deal,"" but a positive one, of course! You won't be disappointed and will watch this DVD over and over!",1422921600,,841,4.6891891891891895

8206584,5,B000SSONGG,"Greetings & Salutations! 75% of the films made for all-black audiences are said to have been lost and yet to be found, among those previously unaccounted for was this precious gem! Not only was the film found and restored, it was made available in DVD format! Unlike other gangster films, it has a plot that can be believed and shows a slice of life in the Harlem Ghetto in the 1930s and 1940s for overcrowded tenement houses over occupied by African-Americans struggling to survive in a pre-war America yet to enter World War Two. The people seen in the background are not movie extras or actors, only a few in the close up scenes are actresses and actors never seen before nor since, sad to say! The creation of the films is a wonder in itself and gives new meaning to low-budget or no-budget! Usually scenes are shot one time as film was expensive and hard to obtain in a nation still in The Great Depression. You can hear, see, fell, smell and taste the atmosphere of the basebent living quarters of the three stars who share their lives and are unable to help the brother who strays and suffers the ultimate fate for going into a life of crime, crime does not pay! This is a ""must own"" DVD!",1347408000,6,1195,4.4363636363636365
