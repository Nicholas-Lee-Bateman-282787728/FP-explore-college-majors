1925558,3,B0000DJYO8,"I have recently bought a number of Yoga DVD's, including Gurmukh's Kundalini Yoga, Brian Kest's Power Yoga, and Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti. I am an enthusiastic beginner, so I thought that this DVD would be perfect for me.

While I enjoyed the upbeat, sympathetic vibe of the women who were leading the routine, I didn't feel that it really provided much of a challenge. I'm 26 and in decent shape, so perhaps this will be perfect for me in 20 years; I don't know. But I'm looking for a challenging yoga routine at this point in my life - one that really works to improve my balance and strength and cultivates heat. I simply did not get that from this DVD. The second routine, which concentrates on the upper body, was more challenging than the first lower body routine, but it still didn't get me very far. Just as we'd be getting into a pose and really feeling it, we would move on to something else. I never felt I got into any kind of rhythm, and I never felt like my muscles were really working hard.

I much prefer the other three DVD's I mentioned, which are invigorating and ambitious. Yoga Zone: Strengthen and Tone just didn't provide what I was looking for.",1132272000,8,1166,4.44392523364486
1925559,5,B0000DJYO8,"I've been doing yoga every day for almost 9 years and have amassed over 80 Yoga Videos and DVD's in my home library. Yoga Zone's videos have become an essential staple that has helped me cultivate my asana practice. I've just recently purchased ""Strengthen and Tone"", and there is no doubt that it will become a regular part of the rotation in my own home practice.

The first program focuses on lower body, lots of lunge type movements that will really work your legs and hips. The second program stresses the upper body, though both routines are holistic in the sense that they utilizes the whole body synergistically in most of the postures. This is something Yoga Zone always seems to strive for (and yoga in general), whole body integration while being able to focus on a particular area of the body.

If you alternate the first and second routine every two days you should see quite profound results in your strength, flexibility and overall well being. Of course, you could also do both sessions without stopping which would give you a very in depth whole body workout in about 40 minutes.

The teachers (Jeanne and Jen) are wonderful as always, they are easy to follow and also show modifications for those who are building strength and/or flexibility, or for those who are simply having a low energy day. Alan Finger,the head of Yoga Zone, always designs the sequences and once again has put together a fabulous series.

In General, Yoga Zone is the best value available. Most of the programs contain two self contained twenty minute routines. They are easy to fit into most anyone's schedule which makes it easy to have a consistent practice.

My experience with these programs is that even though they are only twenty minutes long, if you do them several times a week,incredible results will follow. Of course if you can do it every day then that will be even better :)

Yoga Zone also has programs that are much longer and are also quite excellent with some that are very challenging.

1925561,5,B0000DJYO8,"There are lots of them to pick from and I have a small handful myself, but Strengthen and Tone is my favorite.  Jen Monness leads both 20 minute sessions, one for upper body, the other for lower body.  Jean Kerner assists in both sessions and demonstrates the postures for the more experienced yoga practitioner.  The setting is at the Grand Lidos San Souci resort in Jamaica, wher many of the Yoga Zone videos are filmed.

In the first session you will strengthen the lower body in a variety of poses.  You start out in downward facing dog and hold this pose for a bit, this pose strengthens the back of your legs as well as stretches them.  Next you move into lunge position on one leg, then you test your balance by lifting one arm then the other, then you switch legs and do the other side.  Then you move into downward facing dog again, this time you should notice a little difference that you can go a bit deeper into the pose.  Next you move on to warrior 2, then right angle pose.  Jean demonstrates a more advanced modification for right angle by reaching her hand to the floor, then you repeat this on the other side.  After this you move into one last downward facing dog, stretching out the legs even more.  Then you move into rag doll which is a forward bend with your elbows folded.  After that you will move into chair pose incorporated with forward bends, Jen will have you repeat this sequence 3 more times, along with a ""Sun Breath"".  Next are some poses where you balance on one leg.  You stand on one leg while lifting the knee of the opposite leg, then for more advanced you can extend your leg out straight.  From this you will move into warrior 3 which is another balancing pose.  You will balance on one leg while lifting the other leg behind you and bending over, like you are in a ""T"" shape.  This is then repeated on the other leg.  Then it's time to stretch a bit, Jen shows you lizard pose which is a lunge pose with both hands inside the front leg, you have the option of bending the elbows for a more intense stretch.  Then you move into a hamstring stretch, straightening your front leg and shifting to the back leg.  Next is cat pose combined with more downward facing dogs in a moving vinyasa, you repeat this for about 30 seconds.  Finally you will lie on your back and stretch some more before the final pose where you sit in a cross legged seat.

The upper body session is a little more challenging, you start out with seated spinal twists then you will stretch the triceps.  You will start with reverse plank pose, then move into active cat which is cat pose incorporated with little pushups.  Then you move into plank pose, here options are given to either do these on the toes or the knees, then you will move into Chataranga lowering yourself to the floor, then upward facing dog holding this pose for a bit before going into downward facing dog, again held for a few breaths.  After this series you will move into childs pose, then you will do a sun salutation starting in mountain pose with hands in prayer position, then you lift your arms side and up before moving into a forward bend, then you will move into Chataranga again, then upward facing dog and finishing out with downward facing dog before coming back up to mountain pose.  This is repeated one more time.  Following this you will see fan posture on each side, then you move to the floor and into headstand prep which I really liked.  Headstand prep sort of resembles downward facing dog but it's done on your elbows and your legs in a piked position.  From here you will move into dolphin pose which is a plank done on your elbows, which I found challenging.  After that you will move into sphinx pose which looks like a cobra before moving into extended seal.  You finish out the upper body session with side lean pose done on each side, a nice way to end the program.

In each session there are brief commercial breaks, where Alan Finger, founder of Yoga Zone appears and offers tips and information.  These breaks are short maybe lasting 20 seconds each, some might be bothered by this, but I didn't find it distracting at all.

Jen Monness does a nice job in this video, she is pleasant and does a decent job with breath cueing, she is my favorite Yoga Zone instructor.  This video is best for beginner and intermediate levels, I found it to be interesting and not boring, plus it was nice to see some poses I have never seen before, such as warrior 3 and headstand prep.  I have only been practicing yoga for a short time so I am still learning and improving, but I would recommend this as one of the better Yoga Zone videos I have tried.",1123372800,39,4650,4.403981264637002
1925562,5,B0000DJYO8,"I am fairly new to yoga, but find this (so far) my favorite tape.  I've tried about 6 different ones.  While the workout seems fairly simple, I am already noticing toned muscles and greater flexibility.  The instructors are great too.  I definitely find the focus more on body than mind, so if this is what you are looking for, this is a great choice.  Add Firm Parts 5-Day Abs for a fast way to firm up those parts not targeted during this session.",1111363200,5,449,4.36144578313253
1925563,5,B0000DJYO8,"This tape is perfect since my problem was finding time to do Yoga, but I can do the 20 minute sessions separately if needed, anyone can find time for that!  Good variety of stretching and strengthening. I often order it as a gift for friends. I have used it for years. It has a nice range of simple poses that can be advanced to a more difficult level. There are two instructors one taking the easy way the other doing the more difficult version.  Love it!",1281571200,,456,4.290697674418604
1925564,2,B0000DJYO8,"I expected a yoga workout that really felt invigorating since it was titled strength and tone.  I am a beginner, and even this was too easy for me.  And the commercial breaks on a DVD - weird.",1268006400,,192,4.162162162162162
1925565,5,B0000DJYO8,"I love Yoga Zone Videos and DVDs.  I find they are excellent for beginners and easy to follow without hurting myself. There are two 20 minute sessions on each video or DVD. I try to warm up every morning with a short Yoga practice. I do a 20 minute session during my lunch break. I try to do a session before I go to bed. I find that when I practice YOGA everyday it really helps to alleviate my body aches and pain that I have from sitting and working at a computer all day. If I stop practing yoga, the pain comes back and then I pull out my YOGA Zone videos and DVDs and start my practicing all over again.",1217808000,,609,3.9918032786885247
1925566,4,B0000DJYO8,"Watch the video first, don't even try to do the poses. Then try to follow along, and be prepared to either rewind or skip.

And if you have any arm or shoulder injuries, be aware that many yoga poses require you to put weight on sensitive joints. Make sure you talk to a doctor if you have any of these issues and stop if it hurts.",1194307200,4,331,4.015151515151516
1925567,1,B0000DJYO8,This is the first yoga DVD I bought as a beginning student and it has a commercial interrupting the routine every five minutes or so.  Avoid the earth quake caused by as the spinning  yogas in thier graves and avoid buying this and all similar Yoga Zone DVDs at all costs.,1191715200,3,272,4.313725490196078
1925568,4,B0000DJYO8,Great DVD.  I have done so many workout tapes/dvds because I get so bored working out.  I really enjoyed this workout and it will be awhile before I feel I need to move on to something else.  I have been doing yoga for awhile so I am a bit above a beginner and this workout can be as challenging as you want to make it.  I wish is has some specific ab poses but I still felt my abs get a workout with the other poses.  I will be ordering more Yoga Zone DVDs.,1185926400,,458,3.8297872340425534
1925569,5,B0000DJYO8,"As a busy stay-at-home-mom with two small children, I don't have time for a long workout session. The 20-minute sessions on this DVD are the perfect length. I like the blend of stretching and strengthening. After a session I feel energized and ready for another busy day!",1180051200,,271,4.787234042553192
1925570,5,B0000DJYO8,"One of my favorite parts of this video is that it features 2 20-minute sessions; I don't always have time for a long workout, but there's usually a way to clear 20 minutes.

Also, despite the fact that the sections are short, I personally feel like I've completed a good workout when I finish, and gotten some good toning/strengthening done.

I've been doing yoga for less than a year, however, so YMMV.",1179446400,,403,4.583333333333333

8001294,4,B0000DJYO8,"The series of yoga asanas in this video are good and the flow works well, but the ""commercial breaks"" for Alan Finger to talk are unnecessary, annoying, and interrupt the session. This could be a much better DVD if those were left out.",1415232000,,235,4.488372093023256
8001295,1,B0000DJYO8,"Commercials? Really? Not one, but two of them in each 20 minute segment. Totally ruined this for me. When I pay for a DVD, I don't want commercials every 10 minutes.
