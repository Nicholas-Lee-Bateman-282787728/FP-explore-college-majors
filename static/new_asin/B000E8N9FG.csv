2509940,4,B000E8N9FG,The Green Promise was a great tribute to 4-H! It is fun to compare the old movie styles to the current. No comparison.,1353888000,,118,4.173913043478261

warming and pleasant to watch. I enjoyed it and look forward to seeing it again.",1337644800,,196,3.925
2509942,5,B000E8N9FG,If you have followed Natalie Wood's history you would see why this movie caused her to fear water and the bracelet she always wore on her wrist from an injury she received from the water scene in this movie. she almost drown and because her Mother was so intent on her finishing the movie she didn't take her to the doctor in which her arm grew with a large bulge on the wrist. In the movie's end you will see her rub her arm.  Such a wonderful actress and such a tragic end to her life.,1325203200,,487,4.072916666666667
2509943,5,B000E8N9FG,"This RKO family film is available from several lesser DVD outfits that are linked here. The largest of them, ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

THE GREEN PROMISE is a pleasant-enough if unsurprising story that's highlighted by the acting of a very young Natalie Wood. Like the studio's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TYCOON/dp/B000O599M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TYCOON</a>&nbsp;(1947) before it, this one climaxes with a storm and flood scene.

Here, an inept farmer (Brennan) clears the small stand of trees overlooking a fault line, thus putting his 80 acres in danger of being ruined by flood and tons of soil that may topple down the hill with the first big rain. Mr. Marshall is warned of this possibility by County Agent David Barkley (Paige, also this film's producer) but impatiently ignores him. David's expressed interest in Marshall's eldest daughter Deborah (Chapman) further annoys the old man. For a while, the dutiful daughter defers to his wish that she not get involved with Barkley. In other ways however Deborah shows great inner strength and determination.

The other children (in descending order) are teenaged 'Phinny' (Donaldson), a reliable and obedient son, Abigail (Marshall), the adolescent who tries to curry favor with Poppa by tattling on her siblings, and pig-tailed Susan (Wood), an irrepressible child with dreams of independence via the raising of her own flock of sheep. Although fourth billed, young Miss Wood to a great extent carries this story as Susan, with the budding romance between David and Deborah secondary. Abigail is around just long enough to prove a sneaky informer, while Phinny barely has time to establish his innate nobility.

Brennan is injured by a falling tree early in the story and is little seen until after the disaster he himself orchestrates. Mr. Marshall humbly accepts responsibility for the inevitable mudslide and asks his kids' forgiveness. This 'eating crow' transition seems too extreme for a set-in-his-ways geezer but it makes for a warm and fuzzy ending. Besides this new-found family harmony, young Susan joins the 4-H Club and buys her two purebred lambs while Deborah and David are now openly in love. Whether Abigail outgrows the whistleblowing act or Phinny finds his own autonomy are left unresolved.

2509944,1,B000E8N9FG,"I ordered this movie to show to a 4-H group.  It is a terrible copy of a so-so movie.

Review of the movie:  An old movie starring a young Natalie Wood about a father raising his daughters on the farm by himself.  The constant bickering between the father and eldest daughter gets old fast and I found this movie extremely slow and boring. Only the scenes with Natalie Wood and the other children with the animals was interesting.

Review of the dvd copy:  This dvd looks like it was copied onto vhs tape from an old analog tv recieving its signal from an antenna, then transfered to dvd.  The quality is worse than anything I have seen in at least 15 years and I'm talking about vhs, not dvd.  It is the worst dvd copy I have ever seen.  When I opened the packaging on the dvd case I noticed a horrible smell.  I realized it was some kind of toxic smelling plastic used to make the dvd case(probably made in China.)  Within a few minutes I had a horrible headache and was having trouble breathing.  I immediately(first thing in the morning) sent it back for a refund. I think that the case may have toxins in it.",1275955200,2,1113,4.298076923076923

Rating: 3.5

Pros:
-Have a few seasoned actors that carry it
-kids actors are decent (this is something that can make or break a movie like this)
-Storyline easy to follow and better than I thought it would be

Cons:
-Sometime the acting of Natalie Wood is a little much
-Hour and a half 4H advertisement?

If you are into nostalgia and a good home grow moralizing movie, this is the movie for you.  Like I stated before, I thought this was going to be a movie to shut-off or do something else while ""watching"" it. However, it did end up being ok and made me feel slightly warm and fuzzy(but not too fuzzy) inside.  Nothing really great as far as acting or writing goes, but it comes together to produce a nice Rural Drama.  If you like the Genre, it is something to relax and enjoy life with.

2509996,5,B000E8N9FG,"A great show to see that what matters to the heart is what helps us get through when things and people don't always 'pan out' the way we expect them to.
A good overview for what 4-H represented for helping kids and our country. A good lesson in what harm selfishness and pride can do within a family and community. Walter Brennan, always one of my favorites, made me a bit upset with his character - the selfish ""Papa""/dad - and he showed what happens when the selfishness and pride 'eroded' both family feelings and land! He 'comes through' at the end and shows his true brave character to accept this role when he easily could always be the better hero. This part would have been difficult to do when your 'true heart' bends toward the nice way in life. So it proves what good acting all did together. Everyone in the cast was great in the 'teamwork' and all added to the 'entertainment' and 'adhesive' to this show.
Great for all family - action, emotion, perseverance, kindness, dedication, some humor :) life lessons and love for family and community. Also reveals that not all things and actions can be repaired with just an apology; yet forgiveness is healing starting with the inner heart and spreading like a resurrected tree :).
And actual teamwork does help in the repair. [We don't need more destruction (or 'environmentalism', because that is a destruction as no other so bad in our life!) Yet the helpful Conservation our Country utilized (such as CCC camps and farming agriculture) helped maintain the good place we had before 'environmentalism' started its devastating 'erosion'.]
I appreciated the location - looked to be a real farm at the time and our family always enjoys these 'down home' type of programs. They always share good messages and life lessons to the better. It would be beautiful in color and easily could have made a sequel and weekly program :).",1360540800,5,1881,4.720364741641338
