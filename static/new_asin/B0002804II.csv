8023547,5,B0002804II,"The other reviewer did a great job of summarizing the plot, so I will not be redundant. Suffice to say that this short story is a high quality, high content, nudge towards healing. Not one of us has not met the star of this film in our daily life. Usually we write them off and run from them. Yet too often we become them, and our anger damages others. The path to healing our wounded souls is laid out for us in this jewel of a story. Know someone who is stewing in their own bitterness and anger? Anonymously slip this DVD in their mailbox and watch what happens.",1086998400,2,565,4.192660550458716
8023548,4,B0002804II,"I was bushwhacked by this small independent film at a weekly company meeting.  We often have some ""management game"" or self-examination exercise at these meetings but this was an unexpected message from a mysterious stranger.  A man, not part of our company, was not introduced, but sat next to the boss who introduced this short film as an ""exciting treat.""
The film opens with a fairly typical scene of the manager verbally abusing a coworker for ""less than perfect"" work.  In a series of encounters with others in his life, or those only available through voice-mail, we get a picture of an angry, lonely man, separate from all those around him.  His only ""friends"" being just as sick and isolated as followers of the same twisted ethic.
Then we get to know a little about the man's past, his childhood, and what has gone into creating this monster.  The powerful message of the cyclical life of abuse, hatred, anger, and isolation is shown in rapid clips of a child's ballgame disrupted by a physically abusive father, a broken marriage that fosters resentment for his own children, and collegues that support and continue in the same ""motivational"" style.
The realization that he can not continue to harbor these deep resentments that separate him from others is realized in an unusually spare and touching way; delivered by a stranger with a message.
The screenwriter and producer was the mysterious visitor at our Monday morning meeting.  He shared with us the personal motivation for this film and how he found the source of peace in his life to end such anger.
Definitely the best ""Get on the Right Track with Life"" film I have seen.  Well worth the time and the cost.  I suspect you will be like me and want several to share with family and friends.",1086566400,5,1759,4.744262295081967
