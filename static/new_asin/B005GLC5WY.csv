8471794,5,B005GLC5WY,"I started reading the Pogo comic strips in the late 1950s, and thus missed the earliest efforts of the late Walt Kelly. Not long ago I found a copy of
I Go Pogo,"" which contained material from the early 1950s. I found this to be a collection of some truly delightful and pointed strips. By this juncture Kelly had hit his stride as a cartoonist and social critic,and he effectively used Pogo, Churchy La Femme, Howland Owl, Albert Alligator, Miz Beaver, and many other swamp creatures to poke fun (often gentle, but not always) at the political landscape and often at society as a whole. Although some of the specific allusions in this work are dated, the humor is timeless.",1482278400,,674,4.625
8471795,1,B005GLC5WY,"Horrible DVD! Menus were made in probably the software that came with their computer about ten years ago.  On top of that, they took it upon themselves to censor the film with horrendous dubbing whenever they didn't agree with the original language used.  Print is merely a transfer from the VHS.  Just avoid and hope an official release comes soon.",1413936000,2,349,4.783333333333333

8471798,1,B005GLC5WY,"Pogo is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comic strips of all time.  But this claymation feature is not Walt Kelly, but Marc Paul Chinoy, a dunderhead who has all the subtlety of a two by four.  The voice talent is good, no doubt attracted by their love of Kelly, but the script piles one obvious cynicism atop another, and the beautiful Kelly art is not well-served by ugly clay.

For the original strip, buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pogo-The-Complete-Daily-Sunday-Comic-Strips-Vol-1-Through-the-Wild-Blue-Wonder-v-1/dp/1560978694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pogo: The Complete Daily & Sunday Comic Strips, Vol. 1: Through the Wild Blue Wonder (v. 1)</a>, which reprints pure Kelly in fine fettle.  At first I was delighted to have a chance to buy this ancient film, formerly only on VHS.  But after watching it, I wish I'd stood in bed.  Even the so-so Chuck Jones Pogo tv special (Chuck and Walt did not see eye to eye) was better than this.",1358467200,2,1001,5.552631578947368
8471799,5,B005GLC5WY,"Dated but enjoyable film based on the characters created by the immortal Walt Kelly.  Nice relief from all the current election hype.  Can't say enough about the comic genius of Kelly's strips - the movie brings these characters to life.  Recommended for anyone with even a slightly cynical eye toward the world we've created.  Again, this is a DVD-R as stated in the listing, but we're pretty fortunate to have this oldie in any format, so no complaints here.",1351987200,3,460,4.784810126582278
8471800,5,B005GLC5WY,"This disk was absolutely Pogo, though the choice of voices kind of bewildered me a bit.  It is a classic piece of Claymation and is very well done, all told.  I wonder why they used Jimmy Breslin for P. T. Bridgeport, because it's not quite what I would have though the old carney hustler would sound like. Still, it's a very well done piece of work that I would recommend for any ""Pogophile!""",1347840000,3,393,4.36986301369863
