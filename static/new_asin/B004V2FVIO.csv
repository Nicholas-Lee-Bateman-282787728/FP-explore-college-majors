8442718,3,B004V2FVIO,I really likes this movie. It's about the relationship between a father and his only son. The son marries against his fathers expectations. Life takes a turn and his son and sons wife dies in a car accident abroad. The sons daughter has to carry the heavy message of his son and daughter in laws death in such a way that it's not fatal for the father. Great movie! Kajols acting is excellent.,1306281600,,392,4.383561643835616
