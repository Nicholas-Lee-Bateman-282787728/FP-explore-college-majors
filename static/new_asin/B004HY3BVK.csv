4380936,4,B004HY3BVK,"This is a good film for any surfer that appreciates the roots and history of surfing just live endless summer movies and step into liquid...also if you have a deep love for Oahu, I tear up sometimes watching it good tunes that you will have in your head during a good session or next trip to the island",1355011200,,302,4.224137931034483
4380937,4,B004HY3BVK,"Good quality and well produced movie that captures the North Shore surf experience perfectly and great surfing.  Da kine, brah!",1348963200,,127,5.35
4380938,4,B004HY3BVK,"Not in the class of ""Bustin Down the Door"" but still, a very good documentary of surf competition on the North Shore of Hawaii.  Actually, it's not as much about a surf competition, although it does close with a few, it's really about the vibe of surfing and the North Shore.  I was fortunate to spend time at the North Shore this year and it's a mystical place to this former low level surfer.  Unfortunately, I've yet to be there on a big break day.

If you have interest in surfing or Hawaii, you'll like this film.  Not as good or as exciting as other surf documentaries, it does still further the story.  Of particular interest will be the accidental death of a member of the surf tribe and the story of the very young future surfer.",1325203200,6,738,4.350364963503649
4380939,5,B004HY3BVK,We really enjoyed this movie. It captures life on the North Shore from the locals standpoint and is really inspiring.,1325203200,,117,4.9
4380940,5,B004HY3BVK,IT SHOWED UP ON TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION. NO COMPLAINTS HERE! The movie is great for anyone who loved Step In To Liquid or just any lover of the ocean.,1322438400,,156,4.064516129032258
4380941,5,B004HY3BVK,"I really loved this movie. It has some of the biggest names of surfing. It has Andy Irons in it, before his death last year. Love watching the surfers going in the barrels.",1306627200,3,172,4.242424242424242
4380942,3,B004HY3BVK,"I am a fan of Dana Brown - no question.  Loved Step Into Liquid and Dust to Glory as well as Endless Summer II.

I also was on the North Shore in December, 2005, when this was filmed.

Maybe my anticipation had my expectations too high, but for me, it wasn't as good a documentary as Step.  The movie didn't flow (bad pun) as well - it was as if it was forced together.

Am I glad I own it - yes, will I watch it again before watching Step Into Liquid - probably not.",1305676800,5,467,3.873684210526316
4380943,1,B004HY3BVK,"Lots of talking and only a little footage = failure. The contest rides weren't much and really why give unlimited platform to those most unlikeable locals in the world- the ""native hawaiians,"" like the guy who wishes that a ""10-year hurricane will wipe out all the homes overlooking the sea.""  As if he owned the surf spot!  Hawaiians already have completely unfettered access to the beach all over and seem to have no problem having boisterous contests and tons of lowlives shacking up across the street from the surf spot.  These are the folks who give surfing a bad name, and the sense of entitlement is absurd. There was also the bit about the young guy who came and drowned there and they called it a ""freak accident,"" as if they didn't know people could drown at pipe on a very big day. They then all join hands and cry and wallow and then, you guessed it- go surf anyway.

Any real tribute would include doing something different- perhaps not griping about people other than themselves surfing.",1304294400,7,1001,4.638418079096045
4380944,5,B004HY3BVK,Back stories very interesting and informative.  Footage excellent.  Need to find movie with more longboarding!,1426464000,,110,6.266666666666667

4380947,4,B004HY3BVK,Another good surf flick for the hardcore surfer.  Wished there were more shots like the one on the cover in the movie.,1419638400,,118,4.363636363636363
4380948,5,B004HY3BVK,Great flick!,1418860800,,12,5.5

4380951,3,B004HY3BVK,"Dana Brown continues the tradition of his father Bruce Brown.  Highwater is worth watching.  It gives the viewer the feel of being on the North shore during the Triple Crown, but does not generate much feeling of suspense about any of the competitions.  You get a sense of some of the competitors from the vignettes.  Kelly is featured more as an interviewee than as a surfer.",1402876800,,376,4.651515151515151
4380952,5,B004HY3BVK,Our son loved watching the surfing scenes of the beautiful Hawaiian waters.  It makes our little NC waves pale by comparison.  That's OK because now he's thinking of ways to get to Hawaii. :)  Our whole family enjoyed watching these amazing athletes.,1398643200,,250,4.904761904761905
4380953,5,B004HY3BVK,Hard to find good surfing based flicks without a bunch of loud screaming music with a bunch of clips mashed together. This was actually a movie and done quite well I might add.,1394668800,,176,4.363636363636363
4380954,2,B004HY3BVK,This was not what I expected from Dana Brown.  Way too much focus on contest surfing and what it is like to grow up on the north shore.,1392681600,,135,3.8214285714285716
4380955,5,B004HY3BVK,This is a terrific movie and a really good understanding of the north shore and it's mechanics. Really loved it,1390176000,,111,4.6
4380956,5,B004HY3BVK,"I could deal with a bit less high-minded narration and more behind-the-scenes contest footage, but it's a beautifully-filmed and timeless account of the Triple Crown.",1389312000,2,166,5.68
4380957,1,B004HY3BVK,"I purchased it with high hopes...only to receive a blank disc.  I tried it on two laptops, 1 desktop computer, 1 DVD player and 1 Blu-Ray player with the same results...BLANK DISC.
I figured it was possible that it could have been an escape from their Quality Control department and returned it.  I re-ordered the same disc.  Same results on the same equipment.  To eliminate the possibility that 5 different players were defective, I played another DVD on all the same equipment and all 5 players worked as designed.
I believe Amazon was ripped off by this supplier.  I do not blame Amazon.  They  should ban this supplier and return all his or her product.",1373328000,,658,4.6695652173913045
4380958,3,B004HY3BVK,"Only a video showing surfing big waves, no story like Searching for Mavericks. Maybe ""Step into Liquid"" will be better.",1372809600,,119,5.0
4380959,5,B004HY3BVK,"diffinetly worth your time. Good surf movie. I will definitely never ride waves like these. Heck, I could not even paddle out.",1372636800,2,126,4.7727272727272725
4380960,3,B004HY3BVK,"Not too bad as a dock, but not suitable for pre-surf motivation. Enjoyed it once, probably won't watch it again though.",1369872000,2,119,4.714285714285714
4380961,5,B004HY3BVK,"A really good movie.  Dana Brown put it together perfectly, but now I want to go to the North Shore!",1368489600,,100,4.0
4380962,3,B004HY3BVK,If you want to see how the best of the best handle the Big Water of Hawaiis North shore here is a movie for you.  Having seen some live action first hand on some monster waves this was interesting as a surf flick.  The photography is great and the things some of the pros pull off is amazing.  So check it out Dudes if you love the thrill of Big water waves.,1365033600,,358,3.9444444444444446
4380963,4,B004HY3BVK,"This is a great surfing movie that have professional quality and was well done all around.
