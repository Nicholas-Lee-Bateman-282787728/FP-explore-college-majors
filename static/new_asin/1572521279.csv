188478,5,1572521279,"The late Russian filmmaker's best film, Nostalghia moves like a fever dream.  The images are slow and studied - the film makes you concentrate on them the way you might stare at an abstract painting.  It is to film what  t.s. eliot's poems are to words.

No digital tampering that destroys the film look, and a very high bitrate that preserves the texture. Think watching a good print that is not mint anymore and has acquired some damage. The not so good news: We are all spoilt by now from seeing all the ultra clean DI material of the last 10 years and new 4K restorations of the classics, equally clean and massaged to a visual height not even available during the original release. Nothing of that sort here. No restoration, no clean up. Speckles galore and sometimes a scratch etc. Does not bother me much, but it leaves quite some room for improvements with future releases. Also no supplements beyond a trailer. And the sound could use some restoration as well, for sure. Permanent base noise and distortions at times. If an experience like going to a revival cinema is good enough for you this BD should do. If you want the pristine look of a full digital restoration you have to wait.

My favorite thing about this film is that the female characters main point is to show that she deeply loved the main character or (the artist).. This method is important because tarkovsky spends a lot of screen time developing the female character only to use her a a symbol for the man in the film and the girl that is torn between the ideal person in societies eyes or the artist that she really wants to be with but is afraid of the deep psychological dynamics. This film is very symbolic and may actually be my favorite tarkovsky film as I will have to watch the morror again and decide.the FINAL SCENE MADE MY CRY IT WAS SO BEAUTIFULLY BITTERSWEET",1398729600,,714,4.542635658914729

188486,2,1572521279,"Tarkovsky's film speaks for itself. This review is more about Kino's blu-ray treatment.

Please allow me to preface this by stating that I found Kino's BD transfer of ""The Sacrifice"" to be lousy overall, and I would rate it much lower than the generous 3.5/5.00 that Blu-ray.com gave it. Unacceptable lack of clarity and detail. However, unlike that transfer, which was heavily manipulated with DNR and edge enhancement (Kino claims otherwise, but DVDBeaver has close-ups proving edge-enhancement halos), their transfer for ""Nostalghia"" appears to be untouched. It is rife with damage - scratches, dirt, dust, pops, etc. Almost non-stop. The print is cluttered from start to finish. It is clear that no restoration of any kind was done for this release, which is an absolute travesty when you consider the significance of the filmmaker. While the source material certainly limits it somewhat, the quality of the audio is even worse. Did I mention there are NO supplements? At this price point, that's inexcusable.

I traded my copy to a local McKays and will wait patiently and optimistically that a better distributor will one day purchase the rights and give this film the proper treatment. If you think I'm being too harsh, watch Criterion's immaculate blu-ray of ""Ivan's Childhood"", made 20 years before ""Nostalghia"".

The demographic for 30 year-old Russian catalogue releases is probably fairly small. So, perhaps Kino decided this release was not worth the time or money. That's a shame, because now it isn't worth yours, either.",1392854400,21,1536,5.185483870967742
188487,3,1572521279,"A fine film nearly undone by a mediocre Blu-Ray.

188488,5,1572521279,"""Nostalghia"" is one of those superbly crafted movies that  the average consumer will utterly despise. Watching it is more like sitting in front of an a slowly changing surrealist painting for two hours than being entertained by a mainstream film. If that doesn't sound interesting, Do Not rent this film; you will hate it.
(My warning probably isn't necessary. Who would rent it unless they had fairly diverse tastes in film?)
It's long. It has subtitles. It's inscrutable, symbolic, seemingly plotless, and has no action scenes, romance, or sex. The musical score is classical, and the color palette is so subtle that I usually remember it as black and white.
This is one the very small selection of DVDs I purchased for my shelf, and I've watched it several times. The imagery is oddly familiar, reminiscent of and often identical to that in my own dreams. Water flows through nearly every frame, landscapes melt and merge with the architecture, people appear briefly in strange places and are never seen again. For me it was Tarkovski's greatest and most accessible film, yet I have only the vaguest idea of what the director was trying to say. I'm not sure it's anything that could be put into words. The title of the film is perfect, and, if you're sensitive to Tarkovski's vision, utterly descriptive.",1390780800,2,1307,4.887387387387387

Although beautifully photographed, and the cinematographer and director do take their time to let scenes play out, little happens in this film.  Although this can be said of the films of some other film masters such as Fellini or Bergman, there is never a sense of boredom in those films.  In this film little happens with the dialog as well - conversations don't go anywhere, all very pretentious and one of the bleakest movies set in Italy that we have ever seen.

188492,3,1572521279,"I have seen Tarkovsky's long epic Andrei Rublev which is definitely worth watching and considered one of the best movies ever made.  I have also seen Solaris which is similarly a good movie.

But I just can't get myself to finish watching Nostalghia.  Tarkovsky specializes in Russian-style films which are long and slow-paced by Western standards and the two mentioned above are worth the effort.  But Nostalghia goes on and on and never seems to get anywhere.  The closest thing to a plot involves an expatriate Russian poet in Italy who is traveling with his Italian interpreter.  She is attractive but he has no romantic interest in her and they stay in separate rooms.  The whole idea is apparently that he is more interested in art and unusual experiences than her.  They encounter various scenes such as fields, churches, and largely deserted villages which are really the basis of the movie.

They eventually reach a rundown isolated village where the poet encounters a man who would be considered mentally disturbed today but then just someone odd in the village.  This man believes he can save the world by walking through some puddle and the poet is fascinated by this.  This whole episode probably takes about an hour; I could only fast forward through it.

The main object of the movie is apparently to portray different forms of art such as classical music and anything unusual such as the village man.  There are two many long takes which seem to mean nothing except contemplating some mundane scene.  These include things like fog, puddles of water, and church interiors.  Just about everything in this movie is implied so just about everything has to be inferred.  The problem here is that Tarkovsky's frame of reference is alien to most people.

If you can make it through this movie there may be something more memorable than the endurance required to finish it.",1389398400,5,1881,4.864779874213837

I can't understand what some of the other reviewers are saying about the picture being good, it is quite a bit worse than a good quality VHS you might have purchased of a new movie in 1990.

188499,5,1572521279,"This Korean edition is the only available and affordable DVD version of this Tarkovsky's masterpiece. Picture and sound quality are perfect; however we would expect The Criterion Collection to come out with a remastered version sooner or later. In the meantime this is the way to watch such a beautiful work. For those new to Tarkovsky, this is poetic cinema at its best from a Russian filmmaker who denounced banality and shortsightedness in today's dominating materialistic societies (still in a time of materialist communism ruling the USSR) and searched for true spirituality with a real challenging style of filmmaking. Tarkovsky makes patient films, avoiding the rush of contemporary hollywood cinema (as a statement too) and rediscovering the beauty of the surrounding creation. Narration plays with time, with dreams, with colors, but somewhow everything flows magically. Camerawork and lighting make art almost in every frame, while dialogs and situations bring us to sobriety from the foolishness of a culture that boasts modernity but hides spiritual emptyness. If you're familiar with the author but haven't seen Nostalgia, this is another must, as are the seven films he managed to direct before dying of cancer. It may be one of the slowest in terms of action, but the message is strong and beautiful: a traveling writer finds the power of nostalgia for his land while studying the story of another man who's own nostalgia made him return to slavery rather than renouncing to his beloved country. Through his journey he will accept the challenge of a mad man -to cross a natural pool with a lighted candle- as he finds that such an act makes much more sense than what it seems.",1277164800,17,1691,5.064516129032258
188500,5,1572521279,"Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) is a Russian poet, visiting Italy to research the life of 18th Century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who had lived in Italy for a time, before committing suicide upon his return to Russia.  Andrei is himself on the verge of a breakdown, unable to commit to his research, and longing for his homeland, his wife and children.  At the same time he is unsettled by possible feelings for his beautiful interpreter and guide, Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano).  While visiting an ancient Roman bath, he is intrigued by Domenico (Bergman regular Erland Josephson), a local madman or holy fool, who had once kept his entire family indoors for seven years to protect them from an imagined apocalypse (or are we already living out the end he envisioned?).  Now, it seems, he is convinced that only Andrei can save the world, by having the faith to perform the apparently absurd ritual of bearing a lighted candle across the heated waters.

It is a gorgeous film, perhaps the finest in an extraordinary body of work by one of the greatest of filmmakers.  I was quite impressed to find that the Korean copy (with the grey borders, that I bought here on Amazon from one of the listed sellers) was not at all a cheap bootleg version, but looks quite good.  Watching it on my large HD television, with an upconverting dvd player, I found the picture to be quite nuanced and lovely.  There was a lot of detail in the low key scenes, and it didn't all turn into shadow; and there was an enormous amount of contrast and range in the high key outdoor scenes, with no washing out of the bright details.  I have nothing to compare it to, so I can't say whether they've preserved the precise look of the original - it's been several years since I've seen this projected from an original 35mm print - but it looks quite impressive, and much better than the VHS copy owned by my local library.

This film contains some of the richest imagery I've ever seen in a film, the dream sequences are stunningly visceral, and the use of light extraordinary throughout, but especially astonishing is the closing shot which I won't describe or give away since in many ways it encapsulates a great deal of the significance of the film as a whole.  Tarkovsky makes full use of the widescreen here, and shoots primarily in color but dreams, recollections and imaginations are often rendered in a richly toned black and white.  One other Tarkovskian element that strikes me as perhaps most powerfully developed here is the technique of ""folding"" space and time -- within a single pan of the camera, in a single shot, the same character will appear in repose in differing locations.  I guess it's possible that the characters get up and run around the camera to take their secondary and tertiary positions, but they never seem to be out of breath or out of repose.  It's an impressive and powerful effect, that gives the sense of an untold passage of time within the shot, that exceeds the duration of the shot itself.  If you've ever seen a Tarkovsky film before, many of the stylistic elements and the general approach will be familiar, but each of his works stands alone and says things that he doesn't in his others.  This is the film that Tarkovsky himself thought his greatest, and it is not hard to detect the autobiographical and perhaps even prophetic elements of this film.  Nostalghia was his first film made outside of Russia, and meant he was away from home for a long time.  He completed one film after this one, but was never able to return to his homeland.

Even more, 90% of the movies I watch are world cinema classics: Bergman, Fellini, Dreyer...But in my humble opinion this movie is too pretentious and falls short to guide through some spiritual journey. I think Tarkovsky failed in his attempt to create a parabole of the meaning of life.

Another point I'd like to stress here is that at times, the movie seems to pay tribute to Fellini (8.5 comes to mind), only to be a dry parody of Fellini's dream images, filled with genuine mediterranean sensuality.

It is also his most beautiful, with some of the greatest cinemtography ever committed to celluloid (Giuesppe Lanci was the cinematographer).  The film concerns itself with a Russian coming to Italy to research on a Russian composer who died there.  As others have pointed out, the word ""Nostalghia"" is the Italian pronuciation, and the film is about nostalghia for one's homeland, specifically Russian nostlaghia.  Tarkovsky has said that Russians, more than other nationalities, miss their homeland more than others, and have a hard time assimiliating in other lands.  This film gives you one amazing shot after another.  Some of the shots are truly amazing.  The most famous shot here in where Andrei carries a candle across the pool, believing that if he makes it without the candle going out, he will save mankind.  They rehearsed this shot for 3 days, and on the 4th day they shot it.  Tarkovsky told Oleg Jankovsky (the lead actor) ""one action can be experienced as if it is your whole life"", then told him ""we've only got one take"".  They completed in one take, after which the crew burst out into appaulse.  This film is a deeply spirtual film, like all Tarkovsky, and it's one of his most meditative films.

188509,5,1572521279,"As the camera slowly pans across the interior of a once great Italian stucture, we hear the rain as it seeps through the roof adding to the puddles below. We also notice a sign of sorts on the wall with ""1 + 1 = 1"" carefully written.  It's one of those ""What's this all about?"" moments of the film, which  commonly occur throughout much of Nostalghia.  What Tarkovsky is doing is what he does best: muddling accepted reality for something greater and more spiritual.

The Russian interpretation of ""nostalghia"" is longing for one's homeland. For me, it's longing for the best of one's past. For those of you who have or have lost a beloved dog, this film will touch you all the more, especially during the piazza scene when the German Shepherd seen throughout the film reacts while the detached humans do nothing.

What is this film about? The blurring between dreams and reality, abandonment, the deterioration of society and the deleterious effects of that deterioration to one's spirit, and no doubt much more.  We have become a people so consumed with the materialistic stuff heaped around us, that we no longer know what is important because we are too busy maintaining all that is unimportant.  We need to heed what Dominico cries out on the piazza: ""Life is simple-we must go back to where we were."" In that simplicity, lies our spirit; in that simplicity, thrives our spirit. But in the reality we have created as a society--and sadly now as a global intersociety--we cannot go back. There is no going back; we have traded simplicity for complexity, luxury, beautiful bodies, rap music, i-pods, Paris Hilton, and other things of little importance.  We have trivialized our spirit to the point that it is a withered vine neglected in some broken clay pot, pushed aside unnoticed behind a collection of DVDs. Domenico says that the ""heart's path is covered in shadow."" I say it is covered with materialistic crap as well.

But don't get me wrong. This film is also about the beauty of life, and that that beauty is attainable because it is found within ourselves. That's where the search for beauty needs to begin; that's where the journey toward fulfillment needs to start--within ourselves.  The black and white scenes of personal reflection in Nostalghia excel in radiating this beauty.

This film is definitely not for all. It's pace at times is slower than our most boring days. But it's that slowness that needs to be experienced and embraced if one is going to fully appreciate the art of this film. And this film is just that, art, and fine art at that.",1120521600,15,2567,4.746067415730337
188510,5,1572521279,"There is much to be said for a film about light, air, time, fire, stone, and ghosts.  In this case, the ghost is the past, the longing for what we once had.  It is beautifully portrayed in the black and white portions of the film.

Tarkovsky's works are all subtle.  He has denied any intent to include or use symbolism in his films.  Despite these claims, as viewers, we expect and perhaps require representation in order to find a relation between his films and our own lives.

Each film is crafted into layers: Landscape and visual atmosphere, Texture and light, Subject and object, Framing and alignment, and Aural atmosphere (including non-diegetic poetry).  While large papers can be written on any of these aspects, it is important to be conscious of what Tarkovsky has done.  While his films do not necessarily require cerebral stimulation, I recommend watching his films several times with varying degrees of attentiveness.

Nostalghia is an important film to me.  I was introduced to it in college, and it is one of only a very few motion pictures that I consider a personal treasure.  I do not take offense to the ones I love who could care less about this film.  If everyone understood and appreciated Tarkovsky, it wouldn't be the art it is today.

Nostalghia is a celestial film, drifting far above any claims of comprehension.  This film is deeper and far more complex than many viewers realize.  (This could probably be said of any film in general, unfortunately.)  The film is ""angelic.""  There are angels throughout this film, both in the form of light, divine intervention, sculpture, and if you look closely, there is even a real one walking, solitary, a stark white contrast to the misty landscape in which she has been immersed.

Have you ever closed your eyes and re-lived those memories that haunt you, only to realize that you see yourself, as if the memory were from someone else?  The brilliant Stan Brakhage once claimed this as proof of angels, perhaps your guardian angel; you are seeing that angel's memory of you.  This neuro-testament to the mind and its connection to spiritual, or molecular, life, makes up the black & white shot at the very end of Nostalghia.",1110153600,7,2195,4.802666666666667

Tarkovsky had to leave his birthplace , after making Stalker , and this fact (as the Nuremberg judgement in Frtwangler case) obviously will affect deeply this film maker. Tarkovsky decided to establish himself in Italy ; and the first work will be that one; loaded of Nosthalgia ; notice that Tarkovsky always insisted in the importance given to this word ; in the russian mood Nosthlagia would have similarities with a brasilian word saudade but with major landscape.
The concerns this film deals about are a real tour de force for all the viewers ; the reflectins about the human condition , the abscence of center in our way of living , will let you in shock state and you'll be watch it over and over because the powerful ideas are endless in their meanings and deepness.

188512,5,1572521279,"A good friend advised me to see the film ""Nostalghia"" by Andrei Tarkovsky. Although not familiar with Tarkovsky or his works and somewhat leery of subtitled movies, I was finally persuaded out of respect for his eclectic tastes to borrow his copy on DVD and bring it home. As I expected, the film started in the continental fashion of dialogue with interminable pauses and long held scene shots. However, these irksome qualities were soon transformed into something quietly beautiful and cinematically poetic. I am not just saying that the film bears a likeness to poetry; it is a hybrid, which reaches not for postmodern excesses or gimmicks, but rather back to the nut, i.e. take abstract thought, emotion, contemplation to the reader in a form they recognize, slip it into their eye subtly, and let it become more, something of their own. Andrei Tarkovsky did this in film by deftly driving the versatile plot and characters with discreet surreal imagery and sound effects whose intricacies burrow deep and blossom in the imagination. Truly, this film weaves the genres of poetry and cinema into a rich, seamless, and haunting tapestry.",1075939200,6,1139,5.031746031746032
188513,5,1572521279,"Andrei Tarkovsky's NOSTALGHIA - like all of his amazing films - is filled with masterfully drawn images that simultaneously make the heart ache and lift it up to the heavens.  Literally hundreds of potential paintings lie within its frames.  But, beyond the visual, deeper than any of these, lies the heart of his work - and it touches the very soul of the viewer with the hands of a craftsman and seeker.
Each of the three main characters - Andrei Gortchakov, a Russian poet (Oleg Yankovsky);  his beautiful Italian interpreter, Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano); and a local eccentric, Domenico (Erland Josephson) - is attempting, consciously or instinctively, to fill a void in their life.
Gortchakov, in Italy to research the life of an 18th century Russian composer, is suffering terribly from homesickness - his thoughts and dreams often turn to his wife and home.  His interpreter makes romantic advances toward him - but he's so fixated on his wife that he doesn't even realize what she's doing.  When it occurs to him - she makes it pretty obvious, baring a breast to him in his hotel room and asking `Is this what you want...?' - he's visibly staggered, but remains sympathetic and caring towards her.  The parallels between his life and that of his subject are many - and as the film progresses, he seems to become increasingly aware of them.  This realization leaves him feeling emptier still - and this could be a big factor in his acceptance of the task assigned to him by the madman Domenico.  In fulfilling his promise, Gortchakov is perhaps the most successful of the three characters in his quest to fill the unnamed void within him.
Domenico bears a great guilt.  Long considered to be mad, many years in the past he sequestered his wife and children within their home in a desperate attempt to protect them from what he saw as the imminent end of the world.  Suspicious neighbors alerted the authorities, who broke down the door and freed the family, who had not been outside for seven years.  In one of the most heart-wrenching scenes ever committed to film, we see Domenico, addled, gingerly pursuing his young son down a pathway.  The guilt that Domenico feels over this episode weighs heavily upon his shoulders for the rest of his life.  In a symbolic act of contrition, he attempts to carry a lighted candle across a pool - a seemingly simple task, made difficult by the heat rising from the waters and the air currents.  His neighbors, considering him to be unstable, think he's about to drown himself, and prevent him from completing the act.  When he meets Gortchakov - perhaps because he senses the emptiness in the soul of the poet - he asks him to accomplish this for him.  By giving the Russian the task of conveying the candle across the pool, he frees himself of his own promise, allowing him to move on to what he sees as the ultimate act of repentance - and at the same time, gifts the opportunity to the poet to commit a holy act by fulfilling a promise, which allows Gortchkov the chance to free his own aching spirit.
Eugenia, the translator, has the least understanding of her own needs.  She, too, feels a void in her life - but she seems to think that she can fill it sexually, by `finding the right man'.  When Gortchakov rebuffs her advances, she abandons him and takes off to Rome, to another man.  We see this man only once in the film - while she talks on the phone to Gortchakov - and he seems distant, regarding her coolly, if at all.  It's easy to surmise that this is just one more fruitless, unfulfilling stop on her quest.
Visually, Tarkovsky has done his usual, unequalled best in committing his ideas and ideals to film.  His work - here and in all of his films - is, I've come to believe, without peer.  From the opening images of the fog-shrouded Italian countryside - to the stunningly beautiful photography inside the church, candle-lit - to the hotel - to the spa - every scene has the ability to take the viewer's breath away, and, more importantly, to make the viewer think.  Tarkovsky's views of how humans are isolated from each other - and from themselves - by the technology and the cities we have built is underscored by the scene in Rome, where Domenico has traveled for a `demonstration', to air his views and give his public confession.  He is positioned atop a statue, high above a piazza - the camera angle reveals a wide, low-angled set of marble steps.  One would perhaps expect to see a milling throng on these steps - but Tarkovsky instead places only a dozen or so people there.  The space between them, in this wide expanse of marble and edifice, simply and eloquently underscores the theme of human isolation.
NOSTALGHIA - like all of Tarkovsky's work - is a film that should be viewed multiple times.  Each viewing will reveal new discoveries and insights.  His work is visionary.",1063152000,44,4856,4.641355140186916
188514,5,1572521279,"This film to me is the purest example of film poetry I have ever seen. It does not exist on the level of plot, and yet every image is so suggestive of things beyond or beneath the surface that the only thing comparable to it is a profoundly meaningful and haunting dream.
Tarkovsky was tormented by his Soviet-enforced exile from his homeland Russia at the time he made this masterpiece, and the nostalgia he felt was more than for his own home - it was a nostalgia for the spiritual world that is absent in so much of modern life. It is supremely ironic he and his main character - a bitter Russian writer - felt nostalgia for the spirit in one of the most ""spiritual"" places on earth - Italy. And yet it is frighteningly appropriate today.
There is none of the borrowing from other mediums - whether literature, theater or painting - that is common with other so-called art films. This film is the purest cinema that can exist, because everything is done as an image from reality - a reality that exists in the character's own world, and is transfered to the viewer's by means of the most intense visual imagination.
The actors are so perfect in their roles that they do not seem to be acting at all. That is always a hallmark of Tarkovsky's films - utter realism of human behavior, without the slightest trace of fakery.
Ingmar Bergman called this master of cinema the greatest of all filmmakers, and this is probably his greatest film. It is essential to anyone interested in the medium.",1046563200,13,1491,4.525925925925926
188515,5,1572521279,"Let me first say that Tarkovsky movies are definitely not for everyone, and that if your attention span has been shaped by MTV and pop culture in general, you may not have the patience for this film. If, however, you aren't allergic to poetry, long, contemplative takes or the purposely evasive use of imagery, this could be the film for you.
Don't listen to anyone trying to convey the plot of the film, because there really isn't one. Not really. If you let go of the surface information that usually contains some manner of decipherable plot, you may take away something greater and much more personal, which I believe was the intention of the filmmaker.
Certainly, this is one of the most beautifully shot films ever made. Each frame is a carefully crafted piece of art that I would be proud to have hanging on my wall.
Get comfy (but not so comfy that you want to go to sleep), set yourself up with all the necessities so that you don't have to pause the DVD, and experience Nostalghia.",1020729600,13,991,4.5418994413407825
188516,5,1572521279,"Tarkovsky was unknown to me until about 10 years ago. I came home late from work and 'Mirror' was being shown on TV. Captivated, I sat up and watched it right through. The film made a huge impact and stayed with me for days. I had to see and know more. And so I obtained copies of all of Tarkovsky's films, sometimes not so easily, and in prints of varying quality and content. I now know and love them all. 'Mirror' alongside 'Rublev' would seem to me to be his best works, but my personal favourite is 'Nostalghia'.
There is so much that is extraordinary about this film that it is hard to know where to start. The long, beautiful and lyrical shots that linger over everything, always giving a textural, tangible feel to the 'surface' of the film. The lighting, the spare but evocative soundtrack that often highlights mundane sounds, such as the buzz-saw in the central meeting of the two protagonists, and the Russian folk-song that comes at the start and at the end- these things really stay in your memory. The interiors, the mist, the rain, the wind, the dreams that seem to pull the film into a logic of their own. The meeting of the two protagonists in which they barely say a word to each other. I could go on and on.
The ending is extraordinary and emotional; tears will always come for me as I watch Andrei struggle to get the candle across the pool, and the final shot, enigmatic and ambiguous, is one of the most amazing images in contemporary cinema.

188517,5,1572521279,"I recently saw NOSTALGHIA for the first time. I have seen all of Tarkovsky's films except THE SACRIFICE and am convinced that Tarkovsky is one of the top world film giants. NOSTALGHIA is simply just as superb as all the rest of his films. It is cinematically less poetic than THE MIRROR but more poetic in a meditation type of way, similar to THE STALKER. I think that the best way to describe it would be to say that if you've ever seen 81/2 by Federico Fellini and were curious as to what one of Guido's films would be like I'm quite sure it would be exactly like NOSTALGHIA. The film's Italian language and atmospere add to my belief (Tarkovsky fans who have not seen NOSTALGHIA should realize that it is in Italian and thus has a different feel at first but if you wait you'll see that its still Tarkovsky). It is also filled with subtle symbolism and stark human psychoanalism and is purely subjective in its scope, filled with connections to Tarkovsky and his past, much similar to Guido's hopes for his film. Tarkovsky was, however, behind the camera and surely made a great film. Worth buying for anyone who loves either poetic cinema or simply world cinema.",1010880000,12,1166,4.557142857142857
188518,5,1572521279,"The mercurial nature of this film - its liquidity (incompressible but formless state) - is mesmerizing. The central narrative - a Russian poet researching a Russian musician's time spent in Italy in the 1700s - is the frame which the amorphous stuff of Tarkovsky's film flows up against, into and around without every reaching saturation. All of this is to say, Nostalghia is a portrait of the state of vague desire felt by all sentient beings without ever achieving what is longed for. The exquisite structure of the film - its mise en scene - is somewhere in-between a  parable by Bergman or Antonioni, a parabolical milieu that represents the intersection of variable states of consciousness (of vaporous, fixed and fluid states belonging to one or another of the inhabitants of this film, inclusive of the landscape and architecture) best illustrated by the long tracking shots Tarkovsky used in the black-and-white dream sequences where figures appear first in one part of the evolving frame and then in another, looking as it were at themselves looking at themselves looking at the dreamer looking at himself. There is a recurring theme of architecture as analog for consciousness, and several scenes where architecture in ruins is invaded by nature. And then there is rain, permeating this symbolical structural system like the fog that opens the film and suggesting a rotting, decomposing and regenerative essence within the film mirroring the ennui and the morbidity of the Russian poet as he slides toward his own end, making a pilgrimage across an outdoor pool with a lighted candle to fulfill the promise he has made to a reclusive and visionary madman. This eccentric man of faith has passed his own obsession with this ritual act on to Andrei, the poet, unable to complete the transaction himself. The longing for Russia, the poet's affliction (shared with the 18th-century composer), becomes a universal condition as it is deferred and transcribed into a quest for something that transcends time and space and nationality, bringing home the poet's words that to understand one another we must dissolve national boundaries (and one might add 'natural' boundaries), the provisional borders and walls suggestive of inexorable psychic states - rationality, individuality, sanity, madness and, of course, nostalgia.",1004745600,6,2325,5.216577540106952
188519,5,1572521279,"The night I received my copy, I had some heavy homework to be finished, so I thought: ""Hmm, I will just take a slight glimspe at it... a glimpse."" Time must have slipped away from me like milk in water. When I came to myself, I was looking at the menu with my mind full of Beethoven, candles, and images of water. Later I realized that I had been taken to another plane of existence, experiencing an epic journey through meditation, spirituality, and total beauty.
I bought a box of emergency candles and a lighter the next day.
This is exactly what would happen if you can fully appreciate Tarkovsky's masterful films. ""Nostalghia,"" however, has some elements from Hollywood movies.  In addition, the whole plot resembles many other conventional films as well: The melancholy protagonist meets a crazy old fool and accepts him. The lunatic offers some kind of weird, spiritual redemption but the protagonist doesn't realize the significance. Naturally, some natural forces guide the tortured protagonist back to his ignored mission, ususally at the end. Such plot devices seem ubiquitous but with Tarkovsky's aestheticism, the emotional impacts are utterly unsurpassable by literally any existing filmmakers, not to mention the fascinating images like the flooded cathedral and the final showdown. The formularized plot is totally unrecognizable due to the unique sensations unforgettable scenes, and perfect acting.
The DVD itself, though, is quite disappointing. I can't even click on the time bar on my PowerDVD player. The menu looks cheap and pretends to have a lot of extras. The trailer is simply BAD because it reveals everything. You may want to wait for a better version but I think only Criterion would have the balls to release a new one. RUSCICO will not do it because ""Nostalghia"" is in Italian (On the other hand, you will be able to get all five Russian ones! How exciting!).
I try to do the same thing as Andrei, but I can't even light my candle.

I was completely captivated.
If you like faster paced movies, like most of the gnats who inhabit this planet, I recommend you watch this anyway. Maybe you'll learn something.
At the end of the film I was totally blown away, I just sat therre with my mouth hanging open, dumbfounded. There were two couples on either side of me. At the end of the film, the couple to the right got up and didn't say anything. They didn't even lok at each other. They just looked at that final image on the screen, turned away, and left in silence, looking at the floor.
The couple to the left of me was weeping. Both of 'em. Everyone in the audience was deeply moved. I had only experienced that once before, when I saw Chris Marker's Sans Soleil at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC in 1985. But there, people were more overwhelmed with the steamroller intellect of that film. Nostalghia speaks directly to your heart, and breaks it.
If you really understand what's in this film, you'll never be the same. I know I was, and on my first viewing I only caught a percentage of what was in it.
This DVD has a special place in my DVD/VHS collection- along with Koyaanisqatsi, The Stalker, Sans Soleil, the directors cut of Bladerunner, and Wings of Desire, it is of special merit.

However... it's not exactly for TV. The subtle lights do not show very well on the TV screen.  Beautiful and subtle shades of darkness that Tarkovski excells at, is often lost. Very often, the screen becomes completely black and we have no idea what's going on.

I did not get the chance of watching such masterpieces before. Only a few years ago did I start watching off beat movies (and I was also underage for such films). But a few days back I pulled the book down from my father's shelf, and started to flip through the pages.
I was so amazed by this man, Mr. Tarkovsky, that I asked my father about him, and he said he throughout his life had not seen a finer director than this man. Well I have learnt to trust my father in the fields of art, as he is a painter himself, and I bought this movie from amazon.com
From the first shot in black and white, I was spellbounded by the cinematorgraphy of this magneficient piece of art. It had this haunting look to it, and this marvellous beauty, truly wonderful.
The basic story of the film is that a Russian poet has travelled to Italy on a research mission to find out about his favourite  music composer Sosnovsky. He stays in this town, with his beautiful assistant and in the course of his stay he is haunted by the memories of Russia, and his childhood, and his past.
The basic story though maybe simple the surreal screenplay, and the photography of this movie is truly brilliant. I have never seen a person depict birth, life and death, in such a subtle and beautious fashion.
I feel many people will sleep through this movie, but those who get the essense of it, would bask in the wonder of the greater birth forever.
I have movies by Kurosawa, and Fellini, Trauffaut, Kubrick, but none matches up to this man. Andrei Tarkovsky, he made only 7 movies in his lifetime, and all of them are masterpieces, and I feel this is his gem.
I would recommend this movie for all, but I would especially recommend to those people who are looking for another dimension to this existense, this movie is truly magnificient.
The DVD quality is pretty good, and no problems with the subtitles, and the sound quality.

Nostalghia is full of oblique and blatant metaphor and piecing together the meditations on faith vs.(statuesque)imprisonment, self vs. other, and God's relationship with the lost is worth however many viewings it takes. Tarkovsky's masterful visuals, as always, are a given, so the mental challenge of the film is tempered with gorgeous compositions. The final shot surpasses even the shocking final frame of ""Solaris"", not only in metaphorical significance, but in beauty as well. Yet these images are neither ""for their own sake"", nor self indulgent; each and every slowly unfolding sequence and lingering shot has layers of significance. I have learned, there is no ""filler"" in Tarkovsky's films, each image is a line in the greater poem, and like Joyce's writing, as terse and sometimes as difficult as this master director deems fit to carry the wieght of his brilliance. Nostalghia, like the seemingly incoherent proverbs of Zen Buddhism, can simply befuddle, or, as is their true intent for the prepared, bring Enlightenment. Nostalghia, is capable of both.

188526,5,1572521279,"With his sixth movie, Tarkovsky finally did it. He indeed had filmed dreams in ""The Mirror"", and personally I find ""Nostalghia"" the summum of his concerns. I have not seen it  again, perhaps for some matters of religion that had fallen out of interest  for me for a long time (spirituality or lack of it is the recurrent theme  in Tarkovsky's beautiful work). What I mean is that, never before with any  other film, not even with Kubrick's final sequence in ""2001..."" I  felt that a movie could portray with such subtlety a dilemma of faith. Not  through the dialogs, or through the almost non existent plot, but, at some  point, I can assure that I had what some people would call a glimpse of  faith. I find it hard to communicate these thoughts because I may sound  pretentious or hilarious. Anyway, because of what I was going through at  that point of my life, the dream sequences seemed more real than anything I  had ever seen, in dreams and in cinema: I was truly inspired and  deffinitely I would have given the film then a rating of ""non plus  ultra"" for what I consider true artistic and religious commitment.  (And the reason that I give it now a full five stars rating is because of a  strange lasting impression that other ""masterpieces"" lack for  me.) It's rare, when ""Nostalghia"" is not a thesis film nor an  artistic formulation of self indulgent ""revolution"" or  inspiration. I could sound hypocritical when, as I said before, the  ""matters of the faith"" have fallen out of importance for me, and  probably a worthy film as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" could turn out more  fulfilling or entertaining in some form. Fortunately, throughout the  nineties, films from exotic locations (China, most notably) have turned out  as a learning experience of spirituality for the occidental moviegoer who  falls out for such pitiful works as ""The Fight Club"", and recent  shameful Academy Awards pics. ""The most important movie?"" Nobody  can give a fair answer, and I'm not a spiritual person, but honestly I  think that with ""Nostalghia"", Tarkovsky should gain a fair place  among Welles, Eiseinstein and Ingmar Bergman, who without hesitation, had  called the russian filmmaker, if not the most important, simply ""the  greatest"". Even if it's not my favourite film of all, I can't forget  what I felt when I watched ""Nostalghia"" for the first time as an  important cinematographic experience; personally, more valuable than  ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Un chien andalou"".",953510400,14,2464,4.860240963855421

In many ways this film is autobiographical, in that it likely represents Tarkovsky's own feelings about being in exile from his homeland of Russia, from which he would never return. This was Tarkovky's first film to be shot outside of Russia. The film is refreshingly slow moving. One feels the relaxation of being on a holiday in some historically rich European environment, with an excessive amount of idle time, which affords one the contemplation of one's existence in the face of history, humanity and nature. The location of most of the filming was apparently in and around Bologna, where up in the surrounding mountainous hills was perched a decaying old medieval town where hot springs still filled a public swimming pool. There are shots of abandoned stone walled homes and cathedrals, where pools of water reflect the porous roofs where rain perpetually drips down through. Nature appears to be reclaiming a human past, which is now largely vacant and haunting.

The contrast and colours of the film looks very good, but unfortunately this blu-ray doesn't appear to have been restored as there are numerous instances of dust on the image from beginning to end. There are also no special features on this disc.",1456012800,,1393,5.03030303030303

7797444,5,1572521279,"Nostalghia (1983), Andrei Tarkovsky's sixth and penultimate film is in essence an extraordinarily beautiful meditation on Russian nostalghia (spelt with an 'h' on the director's insistence) - ""the particular state of mind which assails Russians who are far from their native land. I wanted the film to be about the fatal attachment of Russians to their national roots, their past, their culture, their native places, their families and friends; an attachment which they carry with them all their lives, regardless of where destiny may fling them."" In his highly recommended book of reflections on cinema Sculpting in Time Tarkovsky makes much of the fact that Russians are ""bad travelers"" and confesses to being one himself. Thoroughly disillusioned with Soviet bureaucracy, the cause of so much heartache throughout his career, Nostalghia was born out of the friendship that had started around 1975 with Italian screenwriter Tonino Guerra whose regular collaborator Michelangelo Antonioni had attended the Moscow Film Festival that year and had insisted on seeing Mirror, a film the authorities wanted to bury. Guerra and Tarkovsky wrote together the script for what was later to be known as Tempo di Viaggio (A Time of Travel), a 63 minute TV film for RAI. Out of that experience Tarkovsky saw a chance to escape the bureaucratic quagmire that was delaying the release of Mirror and hampering his preparations for Stalker, a film which had a deeply troubled shoot (it had to be shot in effect twice because of faulty film stock) and which was finally released in 1979. The making of Tempo di Vaggio involved living in Italy for 7 months and the experience fed directly into the script for Nostalghia which the TV film turned out to be a preliminary sketch for. Key here was the fact that not all of Tarkovsky's family was granted a visa. Presumably fearing their celebrity director might defect, the Soviet authorities made his young son Andrei stay behind in the USSR. Homesickness (a more correct definition of the feeling evoked by 'Nostalghia') assailed him with a vengeance along with the knowledge that he was already suffering from the cancer that would eventually kill him. A sick man living and working in Italy with new people, communicating in a second language he was only slowly picking up and missing his family, he was destabilized by the knowledge that the Russian film industry resisted him and that Party apparatchiks were machinating behind his back in Moscow while he was gone. It is not surprising perhaps that Nostalghia amounts to a jaundiced and extremely pessimistic view of a beautiful country most foreign directors new to the place concentrate on celebrating, but which for Tarkovsky marked the parameters of one artist's final days cut off from his cultural roots so as to be virtually a dead man walking.

The film is devoted totally to depicting a state of mind so that external events are few. Nothing much actually happens over the film's 2-hour duration. Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky who played the father in Mirror) is a middle aged writer/musicologist who has come to Italy to research the life of Pavel Sosnovsky (actually Maximilian Beryozovsky), an 18th century Russian composer who returned to Russia to hang himself after living in Italy for several years. Gorchakov is at the end of his sojourn and has come to Tuscany with his beautiful Italian translator Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano) to visit the church at Arezzo to see Piero della Francesca's Madonna del Parto (the ""Madonna of Parturition""). Gorchakov is morose, taciturn and withdrawn. He needs to go home but his spiritual paralysis prevents him. His depressed state is depicted immediately with his refusal to enter the church with Eugenia after having driven across Italy specifically to see it. He says: ""I'm tired of these sickeningly beautiful sights. I want nothing more just for myself. That's enough."" He means the whole world here, not just the painting. Later they check into a hotel in Bagno Vignoni, a small town in the Tuscan hills famous for St. Catherine's Pool, an outdoor naturally heated spa whose waters are supposed to prolong life. Eugenia is sexually attracted to Gorchakov, but he is too self-absorbed to react. In the first half of the film scenes between the two showing her increasing frustration and his pervading spiritual funk alternate with stylized visions of Mother Russia. These visions (not flashbacks) range from very short reaction shots (his wife [Patrizia Terreno] shaking her hair) to longer scenes (his country dacha and his family waiting for him) always shot in sepia tones which contrast with the colored reality of present day Bagno Vignoni. The next morning Gorchakov and Eugenia meet the film's third important character, Domenico (Erland Josephson). He is a reclusive madman who once locked up his wife and children for 7 years believing he was saving their lives in a world doomed to the Apocalypse. He now lives alone in a strange warehouse-type house which Gorchakov insists on visiting. There Domenico gets Gorchakov to promise to carry out his latest crazy scheme `to save the world'. He must carry a lit candle the whole length of St. Catherine's Pool without the light once going out. Gorchakov is intrigued by Domenico's firm spiritual faith, but accepts the charge only flippantly. Following a final bust-up with Eugenia after which she leaves for Rome, the film fractures into a long mysterious series of dreams, visions and sheer fantasy (I will come to this later) before we are taken to Rome to see Eugenia and her Mafiosi boyfriend. She phones Gorchakov telling him that Domenico is now in Rome mounting a public demonstration in a square from atop the famous equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. Domenico wants to know if Gorchakov has carried out `his half' of their unwritten pact. Reluctantly, as Domenico immolates himself 'to save the world' Gorchakov carries the candle into the now-drained St. Catherine's Pool and (in a stunning almost 9 minute single take) performs his task with obvious physical difficulty. He dies of a heart attack as he plants the candle at the other end of the Pool and the film finishes on a clearly fantastical sepia shot of Gorchakov sitting in front of a pool beside a dog, staring at us as the camera backs away slowly revealing his dacha behind him and then around it the outside walls of an Italian cathedral which completely enclose both him and his homeland. Snow falls and Tarkovsky's dedication to his mother appears on the screen as it fades to darkness.

One way of approaching Nostalghia is to refer to what Tarkovsky himself said about it in Sculpting in Time. There he is surprisingly concise: ""Ultimately I wanted Nostalghia to be free of anything irrelevant or incidental that would stand in the way of my principle objective: the portrayal of someone in a state of profound alienation from the world and himself, unable to find a balance between reality and the harmony for which he longs, in a state of NOSTALGIA provoked not only by his remoteness from home but also by a global yearning for the wholeness of existence."" The desire to cut away ""anything irrelevant or incidental"" is shown immediately by the film's symmetrical narrative structure which is more rigorously concise than in any other Tarkovsky film. Nostalghia begins and ends in sepia visions of Gorchakov's homeland: the first a shot looking away from his country dacha across a meadow down over a lake with figures wandering away from the camera, a horse and a dog; the second a shot looking up at the dacha with Gorchakov sitting in front with the same dog. In both shots we hear the same Russian folk song on the soundtrack. The film begins and ends in the same place with the same folk song. At the film's beginning the folk song soon gives way to a fragment from Verdi's Requiem (the opening ""Requiem aeturnum"") which fades as we come to the second shot (in color) of the car bearing Gorchakov and Eugenia which drives into the frame. At the film's conclusion the same Verdi music returns as Gorchakov plants the candle (in color) and continues into the film's concluding sepia shot where it fades back into the folk song. The inference here is that everything between the two snatches of Verdi (and the framing two snatches of folk song) amounts to a requiem mass for a man. That dead man is obviously Gorchakov and the subject of the film is his `living death' caused by his ""profound alienation from the world and himself"".

Also inferred by this double-frame is the presence of Italy (Verdi) and Russia (the folk song), the two countries between which Gorchakov is torn and with which he can't quite reconcile himself. He becomes here a symbol of Russia and a statement of the Westerner/Slavophile debate that consumed Russian history in the 19th century. Tarkovsky already touched on this in Mirror by having a section from Pushkin's 1836 letter to Chaadayev read out which underlined the great poet's Slavophile belief that Russia should be proud of her own culture and traditions which are based jointly on aspects both East and West. It is significant that important sections of Nostalghia (Eugenia's visit to the church at Arezzo and the St. Catherine's Pool in Bagno Vignoni) center on the historical figure of St. Catherine of Siena. She was an advocate for the reunification of the Eastern (Orthodox) Church and the Western (Roman Papal) Church during the Great Schism of the Ecumenical Church. Gorchakov can't reconcile himself to two culture traditions and neither can his country. His nave solution is simply to ""abolish frontiers between states."" The film's final image is deeply ambiguous - does it suggest the hero has reconciled himself to belonging to two countries at the same time (that he has brought Eastern and Western cultures together), or does it simply state the hero's (and Russia's) main problem of not being able to live in either one or the other? This ambiguity is typical of all Tarkovsky's films, but what is less typical is the stress throughout the main body of the narrative on a continued symmetrical depiction of Gorchakov's (Russia's?) spiritual paralysis - the nostalgia of the title.

The film is split in two halves which almost precisely mirror each other with Gorchakov's spiritual emptiness mirroring the spiritual emptiness of the contemporary world in general. The scene immediately following the opening credits has Eugenia enter a church and is designed to point out her lack of faith and obsession with modern material values. Dressed in designer clothes, she is asked by the church sacristan why she has come and she answers, ""I'm just looking"" as if she is in some department store. The sacristan than tells her she should kneel which she starts to do but stops partly because she doesn't want to get her clothes dirty, but mainly because she has no faith. To pray would be hypocritical. In answer to her question, ""why is it always only women who pray?"" the sacristan tells her women should marry and raise children with patience and devotion. A modern woman, she scorns this traditional thinking, but the following narrative demonstrates that her failed search for a good man (and with it we imagine children) has left her feeling sad and empty - a state typical perhaps of the modern world and summed up with the depiction of her shady Mafiosi boyfriend as her fate. The religious procession of women praying for children with the miraculous image of birds flying out of the belly of the statue of St. Catherine (and underlined by the Piero della Francesca painting of the pregnant Madonna) depicts a warm spiritually-alive feeling which Eugenia and modern Italy (which she to some extent symbolizes) lack. This whole scene is answered by the scene in the second half of the film of Domenico's demonstration and self-immolation in Rome to save this materialistic spiritually dead world. Remember many years ago he gave up his family by imprisoning them. In an earlier flashback his son asks him on being released: ""Is this the end of the world?"" For Domenico a spiritually dead world (a material world without faith - a kind of living death which mirrors precisely Gorchakov's situation) can only result in madness and it is to an audience of mad people that he delivers his wild oration and for which he immolates himself.

The way Tarkovsky answers one scene with another in opposite halves of the film is also shown by the use of St. Catherine's Pool. In the first half we see the Pool filled with steaming hot purifying water which is said to prolong life by relieving the sufferings of the ill. A group of old people stand in it and their conversation supplies some narrative information about Gorchakov being a Russian `poet' come to Italy to research a composer and Domenico being a resident madman who locked up his family in apocalyptic terror. While they talk, first Domenico and then Eugenia with Gorchakov walk around the Pool. Domenico tells Eugenia about a supposed conversation had between St. Catherine and God which on one level sounds like nonsense, but on another intrigues Gorchakov into wanting to talk to Domenico more - ""He's not mad. He has faith,"" says Gorchakov. He senses this madman (in Russia mad people - Holy Fools - are said to be close to God) possesses the faith which may provide him with a way out of his own spiritual paralysis. Here St. Catherine's Pool is shown as a positive force of spiritual renewal as Gorchakov is given a lifeline. In the second half of the film this hope for `spiritual renewal' is taken away as we see the Pool drained of all water. We are left only with the rubbish of the modern world (rusty bicycles, old jars, keys, coins, etc) which is now exposed for everyone to see. As Domenico rants and raves in Rome, Gorchakov is left to `save the world' by reasserting spirituality through bearing the candle across the Pool. Will the waters come back? Will Domenico's sacrifice result in spiritual rebirth? Will both Domenico and Gorchakov's spirits live on and bear fruit both for themselves and the cultures they represent? These are all questions beyond the capacity of Tarkovsky (or any of us) to answer, but the hope at least, is clearly present.

The symmetrical narrative structure of Nostalghia hinges on a complex series of intensely poetic visions which I will term `Gorchakov's Reverie'. Taking place exactly halfway through the film, it is here that Gorchakov's crippling nostalgia is most clearly stated albeit in a highly poeticized manner. If the film's central pact struck between Gorchakov and Domenico to save the world via trial and immolation suggests the film to be part one of a diptych to be concluded by The Sacrifice (1986), the film is actually much closer in structure to Stalker. That film consists of a linear narrative broken up by a poetic series of images commentators have labeled `Stalker's Dream' which opaquely states Tarkovsky's main theme of the characters' search for faith and spiritual redemption. Similarly here `Gorchakov's Reverie' functions as an opaque statement of Gorchakov's spiritual collapse emanating from his remoteness from home and from his (and Russia's) unfulfilled yearning for the wholeness of existence. Various visions of Gorchakov's idealizations of his homeland have already interpolated the first half of the film (especially the fascinating long hotel room sequence in which, collapsed on his bed as the rain pours down outside, he imagines the dog from his Russian home enter the room, his wife and Eugenia kissing each other and his wife lying pregnant on a bed as it seems to float in the air), but Gorchakov's Reverie goes way beyond a mere dream to fracture the very continuity of the film. Four different `visions' are spliced into each other which are initially difficult to comprehend. Immediately following the scene where Gorchakov has to lie down to staunch his nose bleed having been hit by the departing Eugenia who reads a nostalgia-soaked letter from the composer Sosnovsky to a Russian friend as a farewell, the first vision takes us (in sepia) inside his Russian home. His wife leads the camera outside and the camera pans slowly across people (possibly his family) standing on a hillside (possibly waiting for his return). The abiding image is of the people, a line of electric poles extending into the distance and a dog and a horse all standing perfectly still in a typical Tarkovsky image of nostalgia for one's home. Then Tarkovsky cuts to a vision (in color) of an angel under the water. The camera pans up and we see the back of Gorchakov wading thigh-deep through water away from the camera into a flooded church as we hear the first of two Arseny Tarkovsky poems on the soundtrack recalling a childhood illness (possibly Tarkovsky's own which I post as a `comment' at the bottom of this review, redolent as the words are of the universal nostalgia for childhood, not just of the director's). By the pool in the flooded church Gorchakov has made a fire and in it he burns the book of Arseny Tarkovsky poems which has been translated into Italian and which earlier in the film he had asked Eugenia to burn saying, ""Poetry can't be translated"". Beside the fire is a half-empty bottle of vodka. Gorchakov is clearly drunk as he imagines a girl in front of him named `Angela' (a living angel). A pathetic figure standing drunk in the middle of the pool still wearing his long overcoat, Gorchakov is clearly a man in desperate crisis. As he wades towards Angela Tarkovsky cuts to the third vision (in sepia) of him walking down a dirty urban street. Rubbish everywhere he comes across a wardrobe. As he looks in the door's mirror Domenico stares back dressed in Gorchakov's clothes and speaking in Domenico's voice accompanied by the noise of the buzz saw we heard earlier outside Domenico's room when Gorchakov visited him. Gorchakov continues to walk and suddenly we realize he is walking through a ruined cathedral which has walls, but no roof. On the soundtrack we hear an imagined conversation between St. Catherine and God in which the Saint asks Him to send Gorchakov a sign of his presence, to which a single feather drops to the ground from on high. Tarkovsky then cuts back to the color sequence in the flooded church with Gorchakov lying asleep beside the fire in which the poetry book has now been almost completely destroyed. Gorchakov's Reverie finishes with a long slow zoom away from the dome of St. Peter's in Rome.

The whole sequence of events in Gorchakov's Reverie is deliberately vague and doesn't make sense intellectually. It's impossible to know if the flooded church is real or imagined, or whether the sepia visions are imagined from Gorchakov's bench in the hotel, or from the ground beside the pool. The whole sequence also covers a gigantic narrative ellipse of both time and place - at the start Gorchakov is in the hotel but at the end he is in Rome about to leave for the airport. Several days (or even weeks) must have passed. Emotionally however we can easily grasp Gorchakov's deep spiritual malaise coming from a deep-rooted nostalgia for his homeland. He's marooned away from his roots in a culture he can't comprehend. He makes a spiritual connection with Domenico sensing a possible way out, but he can't reconcile himself to something alien to his cultural roots. As per usual with Tarkovsky the most important thing about this central section (which actually defines the whole film) is that we in the audience empathize emotionally with Gorchakov's nostalgia, that we `feel it' rather than merely `understand it'. Connecting with the film on a subliminal level through ""associative thinking which allow for an affective as well as a rational response"" (Sculpting in Time), the ensuing two scenes of Domenico's immolation and especially of Gorchakov's ordeal with the candle in the Pool carry an extraordinary emotional charge making the final burst of Verdi and the film's closing image intensely moving as a consequence. Herein perhaps lies the reason for the film's uneven reputation. Many people clearly found (possibly still find) it difficult to empathize with Gorchakov's situation. For them the whole central sequence is merely confusing with the consequence that Domenico's sacrifice seems ridiculous and Gorchakov's 9 minute trek with the candle tedious to the extreme. Empathize with the central character however, and these sequences are among the most powerful in the whole of contemporary cinema.

Whether we can empathize with Gorchakov's situation or not, it's worth emphasizing that Nostalghia is the most beautiful film that Tarkovsky ever made. The extraordinary photography worked out with Guiseppe Lanci deploys the usual mixture of everything from color to b/w through sepia, but here the effect is tangible to an amazing degree. Shots are lengthy, many in excess of 4 minutes with slow zooms either in or out dominating the visual scheme. We feel we can reach out and touch the textures and surfaces of literally every scene. The usual barrage of Tarkovsky ticks and tropes are here in abundance - the horse in the visions of homeland and the barking of dogs that dominates many scenes, the presence of mirrors throughout (not only in the narrative structure as I have described, but also in the characters - Tarkovsky/Gorchakov, Tarkovsky/Sosnovsky, Gorchakov/Sosnovsky, Gorchakov/Domenico, Tarkovsky/Domenico, Eugenia/Gorchikov's wife, and in actual mirrors themselves into which characters look and see others as well as themselves). The four elements pervade the whole film as they do all Tarkovsky, but again (as with both Mirror and Stalker) water saturates everything and presents yet more reflective surfaces in which the world is splintered into thousands of glittering shiny multi-facetted diamonds. In Mirror water carried overwhelmingly positive associations connected with the Mother figure - cleansing, rebirth, rejuvenation, purification. In Stalker almost all liquids are connected with spiritual death and non-faith - pollution, stagnation, dangers, poison. In Nostalghia the meaning of water is much more ambiguous. In some ways it is positive - the water in St. Catherine's Pool which suggests physical health and the presence of faith, the rain outside Domenico's house which seems to inspire Gorchakov's acceptance of the pledge to carry the candle, the wine which he takes with the bread offered by Domenico as part of the Eucharist, the rain and the mist which accompanies virtually every `vision' of Mother Russia. On the other hand, it is also negative - the water in the Pool is drained away in the course of the film, the rain which accompanies his pledge to Domenico suggests a possible escape for him but it is an escape which necessitates his death, the positive wine is replaced by the destructive vodka as Gorchakov loses the plot completely adrift in the water of the flooded church, and the incessant rain which is always connected with warm and loving home is also the very symptom of the nostalgia which is crushing him. It is very easy to see the imagery Tarkovsky posits in the first half of the film (especially Domenico's strange warehouse home which leaks rain and appears to be a human abode in the process of reverting back to nature) as predominantly positive, but reflected as negative in the second half following Gorchakov's Reverie. The use of music supports this. The Verdi and the Russian folk song frame the film giving it a sense of perfect balance, but the use of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 `Ode to Joy' shows the shift in balance towards crisis. We first hear it in Domenico's home where it plays faultlessly as the man thinks through his upcoming demonstration in Rome, but in practice, the music player breaks down and the immolation becomes a comic farce which nobody except a group of mad people notice. In summation I'd say Nostalghia is certainly not an easy film and not everyone will like it. It was greeted with much puzzled disappointment at Cannes in 1983 and placed alongside L'Argent, Robert Bresson's diamond-sharp parable for our times with which it shared a prize, Nostalghia seemed rather diffuse. The main criticism was leveled at the film's pessimism and concern with a basically unsympathetic character. Why doesn't Gorchakov just get on a plane and go home thus sparing us this 2 hour wallow in self-pity? To think like this though would be to do Tarkovsky a great injustice. As I hope I have pointed out, the film is a work of great depth and artistic honesty well worth the effort it takes to initially get into it.

This is a review of a recording I made off-air some 20 years ago so I can't comment on the reputed low quality of Artificial Eye's release. I do know the film is reduced to an aspect ratio of 4:3 and there is a reported problem with the noisy soundtrack in the first 30 minutes. This isn't present in my recording though it is still 4:3. If you can find it somewhere I'd recommend the first AE release which also comes with Tempo di Viaggio and a documentary on Tarkovsky. All of this director's films demand great care in the way they are transferred and it seems the only way to get the most out of them is in the cinema on a good 35mm print. Let's hope Blu-ray technology can pick up and one day we can have these fabulous films as they should be seen.",1418774400,9,25406,4.943833372337936
