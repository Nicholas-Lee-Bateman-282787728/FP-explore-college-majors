8260176,5,B0015XAT02,Great for loosening up a stiff neck & back. I have Fibromyalgia and the DVD helps maintain comfort levels if used even just once a week.,1409788800,,136,4.269230769230769
8260177,1,B0015XAT02,I could not believe how bad this dvd was....  The video was probably filmed 20 years ago...  The exercises were nothing special and there is basically just one main exercise.  Save your money and buy something else,1328918400,,214,4.72972972972973
8260178,3,B0015XAT02,"Hopefully I am leaving this review for the correct DVD. I get them confused. This note is in regards to the DVD where you hold your hand limp in front of your face for 45 minutes. (Not the DVD where you lay on your back and reach your arm up while moving your legs.)

I don't know what this helps--holding you hand in front of your face. The spine stretching and twisting made sense, and my spine did become more limber as the class moved forward. Otherwise, that whole hand thing and moving your eyes back and forth seemed kind of pointless to me.

I like the DVD from this couple directed by Laura Paris in which you lay on your back and reach your arm above your head much better.",1256515200,,683,4.206106870229007
8260179,5,B0015XAT02,I sit at a computer all day and type and have been feeling a lot of tension in my neck and spine lately.  I can never seem to make it to a therapist so I thought I would give this a try at home.  I am really surprised by how much this DVD workout has helped to ease the tension.  I am planning on buying the others in the series after my experience with this one.,1216252800,3,363,3.75
8260180,5,B0015XAT02,"If you are over the wall stressed and typically make time to help others before you consider your own needs, this series of DVDs is a terrific investment.  They ""travel w/your laptop,"" you pick your own days and times to work out & calm down.  No annoying music - no screaming - no actors - no baby sitters needed!  Extended family from pre-school to grandparents can join in & relax with you if they choose.  Product descriptions mention improvements re pain, balance, etc, which have proved to be on target.  Gigantic plus from own personal standpoint:  noticeable, nearly immed relief from chronic sinus issues endured since early childhood.  Sleeping better too!",1215907200,3,666,4.945945945945946
8260181,5,B0015XAT02,"I am 65 and have had both my knees and my hip replaced.  after years of playing professional sports my body was a mess and I was living in pain.  I refused to take pain medication, because I was worried about addiction so I just suffered.  I tried yoga and every other cure, but nothing worked until I purchased this DVD.  I am so happy i feel like I want to jump up and click my heels together, but good sense stops me from trying that.  if you hurt I highly recommend the Comfort Zone and if you don't hurt find some one who does and recommend it.",1215648000,6,549,4.046296296296297
8260182,5,B0015XAT02,"After staring at a computer screen for long hours, my neck would always hurt at the end of the work day. My co-worker had recommended this DVD and I am very glad she did. After just a couple of weeks of doing the workout, I started feeling a lot better. I am recommending this to all my friends.",1215388800,,295,4.103448275862069
