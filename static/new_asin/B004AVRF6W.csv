8421004,4,B004AVRF6W,"one of the greatest entertainers of the 80s Jail Yatra makes for great viewing even today. Made at a time when Amitabh Bachan ruled, VK shows in in movies like this & Khuda Kasam how very close he was to Bachan. His comic timing is second to none as he plays Raju the simpleton who keeps ending up on the wrong side of the law. He ends up buying a brand new Mercededs Benz for 51 rupees & the murder & mayhem that follow are hilarious. Reena roy, Amjad khan even Jagdeep are in top form. Ashok Kumar shows his versatility & plays his role very well. all in all, still makes great viewing. The likes of David Dhawan would do well to watch Jail Yatra.",1302220800,,649,4.158730158730159
