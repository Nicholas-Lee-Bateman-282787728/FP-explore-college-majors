963225,5,6305095310,"These stories are great but the tape is a George Carlin version of the earlier Ringo narrated stories of Thomas and Friends. I like the stories, I gave it 5 stars, but in the interest of full disclosure I thought I'd mention the similarity and disclose that Ringo is the better storyteller by a slight margin.  His characterization of Diesel is the best!",1133136000,,354,4.619047619047619
963226,5,6305095310,"This video brings back some of the greatest Thomas stories ever. When I say that I mean THOMAS COMES TO BREAKFAST and A CLOSE SHAVE FOR DUCK. And every single one of these stories is off of a Thomas video that they took of the market so if you don't have those videos, charish this one.

In the stories about Diesel, Diesel told lies about Duck to all the other engines and Duck gets sent to Edward's branchline. At first you feel sorry for Duck but soon enough, Diesel gets sent away and Duck comes home. Another 5 star story on here is GORDON TAKES A DIP. That, next to Gordon & The Famous Visitor, is my favorite story. I watch it over and over again. Here are all the stories on this tape:

1)Thomas Comes To Breakfast(Vol. 3) 6/5

2)Pop Goes The Diesel(Vol. 5) 4.5/5

3)Diesel's Devious Deed(Vol. 5) 4.5/5

4)A Close Shave For Duck(Vol. 5) 6/5

5)Gordon Takes A Dip(Vol. 5) 6/5

6)Double Trouble(Vol. 4) 6/5

7)A Cow On The Line(Vol. 4) 4/5

8)Trouble In The Shed(Vol. 3) 4/5

963227,3,6305095310,"I have a problem with some of the words used in this video. The trains tell each other to ""shut-up"", they call each other ""stupid"" and Diesel says he ""hates"" duck. That is the truth. Call me old-fashioned, but I find words like hate, stupid and shut-up to be inappropriate for a preschooler. I do not talk that way to my child or anyone else in my family and I do not expect him to talk that way to us. I considered taking the movie away from him but he does love it as much as he loves any of his Thomas movies. We sat down and watched it together and discussed the ""Ugly"" words and why he should not use them. He still watches the movie but has been taught that the ugly words are mean, hurtful and disrespectful. Not all the movies are like this one. Thomas has some great stories, this is just not one of the better ones. My suggestion is to pass on this one. There are so many better options.",1091145600,11,897,4.1022727272727275
963228,5,6305095310,"^_^I just can't help but luv this video. Why?A few reasons-
1. Its pretty similar to Better Late Than Never and other stories
2. Ringo was great for his first 2 seasons,but Carlin rules all American narrators
3. And third and most important of all...........Diesel-kun!^__________^
Though it IS a complemation(Thomas Comes To Breakfast,Pop Goes The Diesel,Dirty Work,A Close Shave,Off The Rails and others),its still enjoyable to watch.^_^",1088208000,,439,5.567164179104478
963229,5,6305095310,"I really want to know why they had to stop the production of 3 of the 5 Thomas tapes and rerealse of of the old tapes with George Carlin. Don't get me wrong I think George is a excellent narrator but they rearranged the episodes from the oringinal tapes. This is a mix not a oringinal tape. Thomas Comes to Breakfast was a funny episode and they would use that story later on when Daisy was released. Also Gordon takes a Dip was used for the one when Thomas falls down a mine and the both of those were used later for Thomas Meets the Queen. The three episode Diesel story was good but i'm sad that, that was Duck's really only good moment. He was in Donald's Duck and Duck takes Charge but this one was his best. These are good for people who can't get the old tapes but if you can try to find the original ones. You won't be sorry.",1076630400,,833,4.085365853658536

A direct interpretation from the original stories, it brings the characters from the book alive. My son loves it. On a separate note, the live animation and lack of a lot of special effects is a refreshing change from a lot of the other kids movies out there. It lets kids' imagination to develop and that is why I think that my son watches this tape over and over and over....",983232000,6,520,4.371134020618556

963298,1,6305095310,"I recently purchased ""Thomas Comes to Breakfast"" for my grandson, who is 19 months old and fascinated with the Thomas train set.  He never seems to tire of it.  Other parents and grandparents have told us that their own kids and grandchildren are the same way.  So, I didn't think twice about ordering the DVD from Amazon.  The five-star rating helped me decide.

When I received the DVD in the mail, I anxiously put it in the DVD player to preview it knowing that my grandson would be visiting that evening.  As I watched it, I was surprised and dismayed by the dark and sinister nature of the stories.  Hoping that it wouldn't be a total loss, I searched to find one story that would be ok for him to watch.  I did find one but only one.

A week or so later, I was in a local book store, and I saw ""The Best of Thomas,"" which I bought and found to be a little better, but it still had a dark side, which I didn't like.

Today, my daughter called and explained that she had decided that the DVDs were inappropriate and wasn't going to let my grandson watch them anymore.  She related how his personality was changing for the worse since starting to watch the stories and his facial expressions were starting to take on the mean-spirited expressions displayed on the DVDs.

I'm by no means a prude, but the story lines are disturbing and inappropriate.  I can't believe that they're so popular if, in fact, they really are.  They're just too negative for us.

Buyer beware!  Watch one if you can before you decide to buy!",1165190400,15,1521,4.378571428571429

963300,5,6305095310,"The funny thing about Thomas Comes to Breakfast is that it didn't contain new episodes. It contained Ringo Starr Era stories re-narrated by George Carlin. The story Thomas Comes to Breakfast was part of the Tenders & Turntables release which I highly recommend if you can find a copy. This release is a mix of the tapes Tenders & Turntables, Better Late Than Never, and Thomas Breaks the Rules which are three of the best ever made.

If the DVD is the same as the VHS release, the stories are

Thomas Comes to Breakfast

Pop Goes the Diesel

Diesel's Devious Deed

A Close Shave for Duck

Gordon Takes a Dip

Double Trouble

A Cow on the Line

Trouble in the Shed

If you are new to Thomas then your child probably owns the newer DVDs as opposed to the earlier era which isn't really available on DVD and the tapes are really hard to find. These stories contain none of those activities in between stories. It also features the classic theme song that every old fan loves. If you really want a good release I recommend the Thomas Early Days DVD set which has all the old stories narrated by Ringo Starr. You won't see Emily or Salty in any of these stories but you will see the roots that made Thomas so great and classic. The old stories are the ones that parents will want to watch with their kids.

If your kid loves Thomas than this is a must have. Thomas teaches kids more about sharing and friendship than most of the other shows around. As an added bonus you get the wooden train with it. Thomas is something that your kids will want to watch again and again.",1142640000,27,1566,4.347079037800687
963301,4,6305095310,Great video!  My son loves Thomas.  This is the 6th DVD I bought for him.  I thing this is a great deal.  You pretty much buy the DVD and get the train for free.  If I purchased the wooden train by itself it would have cost me the same with no DVD.  Once I put this DVD on my son grabs his trains and plays with them while watching the DVD over and over and over...I get a lot done while he is occupied.  By the way he is only 20 months old and he is learning his colors with Thomas as well as recognizing the numbers on the trains.,1142208000,,532,3.7818181818181817

7882639,5,6305095310,"Of all the Thomas The Tank Engine dvd's that I have, this one is one of the best. All but two of the episodes are from the second season, which was when the cast of characters was vastly expanded. George Carlin does the narration and two of the episodes feature Diesel. In these episodes, Diesel was the sinister, cold-hearted villain and Carlin's voice characterization reflects that (Ringo Starr used a similar voice). The episodes on this are:

Thomas Comes To Breakfast: Thomas crashes into the Stationmasters house and is rescued by Donald and Douglas. This episode was part one of a three episode story arc that continued with Daisy and Percy's Predicament (both of which are found on the DVD Percy Takes The Plunge).

Pop Goes The Diesel: Duck brags about doing things ""the Great Western way"" until a new engine called Diesel arrives (this episode marks Diesel's first appearance on the series). Diesel soon has a mishap with rusty old freight cars and the cars sing a catchy song about him (to the tune of Pop Goes The Weasel). This episode was part one of a three episode story arc that continued with the next episode on this disc.

Diesel's Devious Deed: Diesel is harboring serious resentment towards Duck since he blames Duck for the incident with the freight cars in the previous episode. Diesel decides to spread lies about Duck in the hopes that Duck will be sent away. Diesel's plan works and Duck is sent to work at Edward's station. You can't help but feel sorry for Duck.

A Close Shave For Duck: In the conclusion of the three episode story arc, Duck is helping Edward push a freight train up Gordon's Hill. When Duck starts heading back to the station, the freight cars break away from Edward and chase Duck down the hill and straight into a barber shop. The furious barber puts shaving cream on Duck's face. Sir Topham Hatt reveals that he discovered that Diesel was lying and has sent Diesel away.

Gordon Takes A Dip: Gordon refuses to pull a freight train and ends up in a ditch (""silly old Gordon fell in a ditch, fell in a ditch, fell in a ditch, silly old Gordon fell in a ditch, all on a Monday morning"") This episode was titled ""Off The Rails"" in the Ringo Starr narration. This is one of two season 1 episodes on this disc.

Double Trouble: Thomas has a mishap at the coal hopper and gets covered in coal dust. Later, Percy goes thru the buffers and ends up in a pile of coal. This was the first episode of season 2.

A Cow On The Line: Gordon and Henry tease Edward for pulling cattle cars, but when a cow blocks the tracks in front of Henry and Gordon, Edward gets the last laugh.

Trouble In The Shed: Henry, Gordon and James refuse to come out of the shed because ""tender engines don't shunt"" and Sir Topham Hatt has no choice but to buy Percy. This episode marks Percy's first appearance in the series. This is the other season 1 episode on this disc. It was also part two of a three episode story arc beginning with Tenders and Turntables and ending with Percy Runs Away.",1373155200,,3009,4.4881170018281535

7882642,5,6305095310,"I just read the review that gave this video 1 star.  Although I understand what she meant by the ""dark side"" of Thomas and some negative expressions on the faces of the trains that may be mimicked by kids, I also think that such is life in childhood (and adulthood).  There are good and bad examples everywhere you look.  The Thomas stories give examples of ""bad"" or unacceptable behavior, but this kind of behavior isn't rewarded in the end.  As much as I would love to have a kids program that shows nothing but positive examples, having negative examples to talk about with my child is beneficial too.  My son often makes comments like ""that wasn't nice"" when one character is being ""mean"" to another character.  I will say that Thomas can be somewhat ""classist""; there are steam engine and diesel engine clicks and the ""troublesome trucks"" seem to be portrayed as ""lower class"".  Gordon and James, in particular, seem to be snobs at times.  This, unfortunately, is life and perhaps this can be part of the conversation as your child gets old enough to understand this.  I also keep in mind that Thomas the tank engine is 60 years old.
All that aside, there is nothing, and I mean nothing as completely absorbing to my son as Thomas and friends.  It has fired his imagination and, thankfully, has encouraged my ""late talking"" son to narrate his stories as he plays with his wooden train set.  My son fell in love with Thomas when he was 2 years old and 2 years later, Thomas is still going strong.  Friends and relatives say that their children (particularly boys) loved playing with Thomas until they were 6 or 7.  ""Thomas Comes to Breakfast"" DVD is a particular favorite of my son.  I love Thomas the tank engine books, wooden railway trains and track, and DVD's and would recommend them absolutely.",1271030400,,1804,4.632075471698113
