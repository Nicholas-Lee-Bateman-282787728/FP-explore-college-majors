6724847,5,B00O5GZ6OA,"Some shows I really liked from the past turn out to be not as great when viewing them as an adult, but this is an exception.
Was one of my favorites back then and still is now.  Shared with my daughter and she loved it also!",1422835200,,224,3.869565217391304

8682253,2,B00O5GZ6OA,I love the disc but I think its ridiculous that the disc dosent contain a full season like other programs do. If you purchase the full season 1 disc its 68.00 which is also ridiculous.  Why is the pricing so high? I bought one and won't buy the rest. A European copy is available for 18.oo for the full season but cant be played on most American DVD and Blue Ray players. The company that sells this disc or the Label whomever dictates the price shouldnt gouge the fans in this manner.  Dont buy anymore discs until it is priced fairly or the powers that be will continue their greed. Thanks for reading!,1504742400,,604,4.336283185840708
