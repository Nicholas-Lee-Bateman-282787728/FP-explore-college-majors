8659243,2,B00KIKJV84,"Don't believe the package description that lists subtitles for Fleming's songs. It is wrong. It's unbelievable that neither the DVD nor the BluRay versions, in the separate or combined packs, incudes subtitles for Fleming's German songs. Unitel spent $100,000 producing this disk and then cheaped it out by saving $500 that it would have cost to hire a grad student to subtitle it--or else left the subitles off the disk by mistake. In either case, just one more illustraton of modern rudderless, penny-pinching, corner-cutting, no-one-in-charge bureaucracy.",1523664000,,558,5.5

8659246,5,B00KIKJV84,"A fantastic recital! It is worth having for the Zemlinsky and Korngold alone, but the entire program is wonderful. It is great to have the wonderful often forgotten music of the era represented in such a perfect historically important recital. And, to have them performed to perfection will guarantee they last. Perhaps this will help get the Korngold songs more success and have them get heard by more and more audiences. They deserve so much more than history and World War II allowed.",1445299200,,487,4.879518072289157
8659247,5,B00KIKJV84,"I thoroughly enjoyed this lovely recital. Renee Fleming presents an intelligent selection of Viennese Fin de Siecle lieder from the cute light fare in the beginning to balance the heavier selections in the middle. I think the Korngold selections are my favorite and she sings the meltingly lovely ""Marietta's Lied"" in encore. I had not heard the Zemlinsky selections previously and found them rather dark and grim but Ms. Fleming got into the drama of their forboding subject and pulled them off well. Other reviewers have wondered at her selection of Gershwin's Summertime as the final encore but I thought it a nice light happy ending after the heavy emotional pull of the latter selections in the program. Overall a wonderful performance by Ms. Fleming. Her presence on stage is magnetic and she really works to engage her audience. What could be batter than her golden voice in the Golden Hall at the Musikverein! Well worth purchasing for any fan of Ms. Fleming's.",1433894400,3,969,4.950920245398773

8659252,5,B00KIKJV84,"Rene Fleming presents the full variety of this unique epoch. The venue of her recital with Maciej Pikulski at the piano is, of course, the Golden Hall of the Musikverein Vienna. A feast of rhapsodic, sensual Viennese fin de sicle. Renne Fleming at her best. And what a great cover!",1412035200,,281,4.64
