2881361,5,B000S5W9RY,"I discovered the great Rocio Durcal on YouTube several months ago and am transfixed by her commanding voice, beauty and showmanship.  I wondered why I had never heard of her before because she is clearly one of the great ones in Spain and Mexico.  She reminds me of Judy Garland in terms of the full use of her face and body and arms as she ""becomes"" the song.  I don't think I have ever seen and heard so consummate a performer in the U.S.  Although, the great Betty Hutton had a similar command of her face-body-arms-voice; if not so fine a voice as Miss Durcal.  This concert presents her in full voice singing beautiful and dramatic songs with a presence that is unsurpassable.  Thanks to Spain and Mexico for the gift of this great entertainer.",1231632000,5,749,4.511111111111111

8204338,5,B000S5W9RY,"Originally a gift for my mother who's root ancestry is from Mexico and loves music, this is one of her favorite singers.  It looks like I had not seen this live concert of her and I had to buy it.  Really nice with appearances with Juan Gabriel and Enrique Guzman.  Nobody sings like her.  Highly recommended for her fans and an absolute keeper.",1391644800,,345,4.428571428571429
8204339,3,B000S5W9RY,"It has a great song selection, incluiding duet with Juan Gabriel.
The thing is poor video quality.  It's like watching a recording from de 80s.
I watch it in my 16"" screen computer and didn't look that well, so imagine watching it in a 42"" LCD.
Still I enjoyed the DVD but, should have been better.",1388361600,,298,4.321428571428571
