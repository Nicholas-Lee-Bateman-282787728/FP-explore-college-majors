This film takes a vitally exciting period in China's history and turns it into something on the order of a 1940's Encyclopedia Brittanica school film. Lots and lots  and lots of talking between Mao and everyone else. Quite a few scenes of soldiers walking, and one spectacularly exploding horse. The battle scenes are poorly staged montages, and the true heroic moments are given short screen time. The Chinese have proven to be among the world's great filmmakers, but I guess they hadn't quite hit their stride when  The Long March was made.",1370131200,,670,5.027027027027027
