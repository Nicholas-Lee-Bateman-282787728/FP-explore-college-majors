8277511,2,B001AHPB4M,"The Chicago Fire is well discussed in Chicago itself, but I don't know how much others would know about it.  This work emphasizes that it was the worst fire in American history.
This work's angle is to reenact things to see if the statements of witnesses were true.  For example, a lantern burns so thoroughly that they conclude that neighbors' statements about finding a burnt lantern could not have been true.  There are set fires all over this work, so pyro fans would simply love it.  I just got tired of ""we reeancted X"" and ""we reenacted Y"" as much as I love documentaries about my city.  This was just not a work that I would consider ""da bomb""!
In the work, a historian with severe disabilities is interviewed.  I love that he was included; since he's an expert, there's no reason not to include him.  I wish him the best.  However, I did keep wondering, ""What conditions do you have?""  He was somewhat conspicuous or his presence did push my mind away from the Chicago Fire for a second.  You know that genius who was on the MENSA episode of ""The Simpsons""?  He striaght up tells people about his condition and then goes on into his studies.  I kinda wish that could have happened here, but then again, maybe the interviewee gets sick of talking about it.
This disc is very lacking on the features tip.  On the menu page, it is very non-descript.  The chapters are not given titles.  They just say, ""Ten minutes in"", ""Twenty minutes in"", etc.",1218585600,,1451,4.505747126436781
