8178144,5,B000BUJNBQ,"This video is espcially well recieved by me due to it containing ""A Blast from the Past and Present"" a video Thrasher had put together from the 80s.  It captures well the times of skateboarding in that era but in-of-itself is a nice chunk of content.

I would not recommend this to someone who is used to or dependent on the video styling or editing of the current videos.

But, if you appreciate skateboarding in general, then this would be a good addition to your collection or to at least view once and add to that swirl of skate in your brain.",1283817600,,547,4.3431372549019605
