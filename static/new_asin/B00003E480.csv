Sure, I don't know how they create the illusion of levitation but having the lady start out in a glass cage with a lot of corn snakes bred to be different colors, milksnakes, ball pythons and other non-venomous snakes hardly creates an illusion of danger.

Another one, a guy suspended in the air escapes from being tied up while 3 ropes suspending him ""burn through"".  Are we to believe that they would snap clean one at a time.  No sign of increasing tension until these ropes ""burn through"" and snap.

I have to assume these are cables inside that release electronically.  Like we are to believe...

a) a rope burns through in less than a minute
b) the ropes have any possibily of snapping clean one at a time
c) they will snap at just the correct moment right after he frees himself.

The sword through the basket with the lady inside is obvious just poking through the edges not going near the middle!

A few of the illusions wouldn't be illusions at all if the ""audience"" members were shills.  For example, ""audience"" members blindfold a magician and another ""audience"" member mixes knives (3 upside down and one point up) covered with a paper cover.  The magician then slams his hand on the 3 with the handle up.

There is some that are not easily figured out but there is much too much obvious happenings in this.",1135814400,,1390,4.516
