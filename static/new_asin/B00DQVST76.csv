5847979,5,B00DQVST76,"I would like to know if this DVD is official, because I didn't find out nothing about it in Madonna's web site

Thank you to everybody who took some minutes for write some words and provide me the information about the MDNA DVD. I modify my review and for all I'm not a little Monster LOL ;)",1375401600,2,291,4.105263157894737
5847980,5,B00DQVST76,"The show is completely breath taking!!! It really capture the essence of the live performance but you feel like you are watching a movie at the same time. The Journey of a lost soul in the darkness coming to the light. It's also incredible to see people of all ages singing to the songs, Madonna keeps touching souls whether it is remembering your teenage years or learning your way through life, very emotional and extremely entertaining.",1375315200,3,439,4.7894736842105265
5847981,5,B00DQVST76,The show was dark and moody at the beginning with a transition into conflict and then into resolution and light. Loved the energy of the show. Was up front and M looked amazing of course.  Unforgettable experience!  Buy it now!,1375315200,8,227,4.65
5847982,5,B00DQVST76,"I went to see this show in Atlanta and I'm here to tell you that it is AWESOME.  There is not a single artist in the music industry that puts on a show like THE QUEEN.  People may complain that she charges too much for tickets but you definitely get your  moneys worth, it is non-stop visual effects from beginning to end.  Quite honestly I have never seen anything like it.  She was awarded the BIGGEST TOUR OF THE YEAR award for this show and it is just that, unbelievable...",1375315200,9,477,4.2555555555555555

5847985,5,B00DQVST76,THIS SHOW IS AMAZING.  FROM BEGINNING TO END.  IT IS A JOURNEY FROM LIGHTS OUT TO LIGHTS ON.  YOU CAN SAY WAHT YOU WANT ABOUT MADONNA BUT THE WOMAN CANPUT ON A SHOW.

5847992,3,B00DQVST76,"I guess when you're a disco diva pushing 55 you jazz up your shows with lots of swearing and dramatic images of simulated bondage, rape and bloody gun violence?  I watched this ""show"" with my wife and after the first 10 minutes we were both like...wtf, Madonna?  Even at her age she still has plenty of talent left to put on a good tour/show without all the ""trying way too hard to be edgy"" shtick.  There are some good performances of her classic stuff to be found here if you can stomach to sit through the rest.  Use the ""song selection"" option to skip the first half of the concert...you'll thank me later.",1436140800,,610,4.371681415929204

I thought your vision was better than that.  And stop finding these little groups in some foreign land that you highlight during your concerts.  No one cares!  They are there to see you!  And stop changing up the classics so much that we don't even recognize them.  These songs are ours, your fans; and we want to hear them the way you gave them to us!",1421884800,,505,4.461538461538462
5848006,5,B00DQVST76,Loved seeing the concert in person and loved watching the tour dvd just as much. Madonna puts her heart and soul into all of her shows and this one proves she's still the Queen and always will be.,1421539200,,196,4.184210526315789

5848019,5,B00DQVST76,What can you say?  Its Madonna !,1412726400,,32,3.5714285714285716
5848020,2,B00DQVST76,"I'm not sure why they put out such a poorly done/mixed live CD, especially when the Sticky and Sweet and Confession live CDs were done so well. It just sounds like it was recorded from the middle of the arena, not even from the mixing board.

Madonna's vocals are clear, but its all crowd noises (are they even real) and you can't really hear any of the music, instrumentation...no bass or dynamic range. Disappointing.",1411603200,,419,4.662162162162162

5848032,5,B00DQVST76,"This if for Madonna freaks and mild listeners alike.  I've never been to a Madonna concert, and now I see what I'm missing.  She really delivers in this concert that helps promote her MDNA album.",1403222400,,195,4.542857142857143
5848034,5,B00DQVST76,I saw this show in Washington DC and it was amazing.  I was lucky to be able to attend to both functions. 3rd row one night and the next one I got to enjoy from the golden triangle.  Madonna is full of energy. She's like the energizer bunny. Seeing it on the screen reminded me of the great time I had in DC. It's a great show. Madonna did it again.,1401580800,,349,3.9014084507042255
5848035,5,B00DQVST76,I'm a huge fan of Madonna and this show was one of my favorites. This show was very dark much darker than her previous shows loved very moment of this show can't wait to see the next tour.,1399852800,,188,3.973684210526316
5848036,1,B00DQVST76,I have all of the other Madonna tour CD's and they all were sound mixed well.  This one is terrible.,1398729600,,100,4.0
5848037,5,B00DQVST76,Amazing show! Not so happy with the editing. It doesn't look like her previous live DVDs that's for sure. Other than that it's spectacular !,1397952000,,140,4.64
5848038,5,B00DQVST76,"I think this is another great concert by Madonna.  However, I still think her Confessions on a Dance Floor is still her best concert.",1397865600,,133,4.541666666666667

5848043,5,B00DQVST76,It's quite entertaining and really different from other concerts I seen before from her and other artists!  She really bad girl and original and creative as an artist!,1392508800,,167,4.964285714285714

5848049,3,B00DQVST76,"I love Madonna, I grew up on her and I have seen her live several times and wished I had seen this tour in person. Now I'm not so sure. Her ego has seems to have grown larger ( at least in her public persona) than her social and self awareness. I hope the gay police won't arrive promptly banging on the door to take my card. The new album as well as this production seem to be an endless rant against her ex husband and her divorce settlement. Madonna and her money are not easily torn asunder. I tried Madonna, I really did, but can you hear yourself? And the guns in this day and age and in this culture of gun violence are not an artistic statement but an irresponsibility. There, I've said it.",1390348800,2,698,4.139705882352941

5848052,5,B00DQVST76,"I attended this concert when it came to LA along with the 2 past tours, Sticky & Sweet and Confessions, but this is THEE best Madonna tour ever! The whole first act is something she's never done before and very Dark. I loved every single moment of this concert. It truly is art!",1389398400,,278,4.264150943396227
5848054,2,B00DQVST76,"The sound and voice quality of this whole concert is not great. It sounds like the sound engineers (if there was one) spent about 10 minutes on mastering the whole thing. It also sounds like people's cheers and clapping are set on loop, like they are just placed there for the duration of the whole concert. Just something I did not expect from Madonna, it's always the best quality, the best producing and the best version or closest version to something that a person might experience in live. I was very disappointed with this. Comparing this to the Confessions. Tour, one might not even think it's the same artist.",1388880000,,618,4.678899082568807
5848055,5,B00DQVST76,Best concert ever. The quality of this video is amazing. I was in Miami when they filmed this DVD. Get it now!!!!!!!!!!,1388707200,,119,4.454545454545454
5848056,2,B00DQVST76,"I waited until the sound and audio corrections were apparently made before I bought the dvd.  The editing is relentlessly fast and busy, making the viewer unable to focus and enjoy the choreography, atmosphere, or continuity until the ballads, where things slow down a bit more.  The sound was OK, although there is so much trickery going on to make the show sound live that you don't know when you're hearing post-production sound, pre-recorded ""live"" studio recordings, or the real thing.  I used to keep my Madonna concerts and watch them over and over again, but I can't watch something like this.  I get angry and tired having to constantly refocus every second on a new image and not simply able to enjoy a song and take in the entire spectacle.  Oh and did I mention the lighting?  The film is so overexposed and with filters that her face glows like a light bulb with eyes, nostrils, and lips.  I have a feeling if this is the way she wants her concerts to be remembered and recorded now, that The Confessions Tour will be the last Madonna concert I keep and want to watch again.  It's the last one I enjoyed on multiple levels.",1388534400,,1136,4.534313725490196
5848057,5,B00DQVST76,Hardcore Madonna Entertainment in Miami.  Two Hours of Continuous entertainment professionally recorded and edited by Madonna.  A great concert experience you cannot match in the live show.  Special Effects that you can't stop watching will blow your mind when you watch it on. a large screen HDTV.  A spectacular show that never gets stale and you just want to place on Repeat!,1388448000,,378,5.048387096774194
5848058,5,B00DQVST76,What? I can't even believe this girl I loved it. One of the best concerts I ever seen. She is so fit I can't believe she performs like that!,1388275200,,140,3.8620689655172415
5848059,5,B00DQVST76,"very good Tour I did not see this live but when I bought the Blu Ray version and watched in the living room with the surround sound and sub woofer with the lights off, I felt like i was in the concert watching live.  I guess this will happen with a bigger flat Screen TV and top of the line surround sound system.  excellent buy",1388102400,,328,4.030769230769231
5848060,1,B00DQVST76,"i saw the show in Philadelphia 5 years ago. I drove 6 hours to see the show. it was really great. then i went to the MDNA tour in 2012 in Pittsburgh and it was shameful. why does Madonna incorporate shootings in her performance. machine guns, a murder and herself being thrown around on stage. The beginning of the show started out with a Turkish style curtain and a couple dancers appearing with wings on their back. Okay, but this opening related to absolutely nothing in the rest of the show. Madonna did a cheerleader style outfit and song which also was out of place.  the Philadelphia tour 5 years before was so great, I could not believe the choice her choreographer made for this tour. Especially for the first return visit to Pittsburgh in 30 years.  Madonna is capable of so much more.  i am sure the next tour will be much better. I hope she chooses a new choreographer and plays her great songs.  I am sorry that i brought my twin sister and my niece to this MDNA tour.  At the three quarter point of the show, the entire crowd was quiet. they did not know what to believe. the show was terrible",1387584000,2,1107,4.354368932038835
5848063,5,B00DQVST76,"what else is there to say about the queen of pop! the dvd isn't her best produced show,all chopped up and put together from various shows and defeats the purpose of a live show and looks very washed out to hide age lol but otherwise its great in every way!",1387065600,,256,4.14
5848064,5,B00DQVST76,"This is the greatest concert ever by Madonna,  the way of the interlude of ""Justify My Love"", the waltz of ""Like a Virgin"" , the chorus on ""Open Your Heart"", all I just have to say is ""WOW""",1386892800,,189,3.973684210526316

5848066,2,B00DQVST76,"too much editing - it's dificult to watch it! :( And poor sound quality... It was a great show, I watched it live, but the concert DVD is a big disapointment. The previous ones were sooo much better!",1386460800,5,199,4.2631578947368425
5848067,1,B00DQVST76,"The DVD was released and pulled out because of A major production flaw. I was so excited about it. I saw the MDNA show in L.A. So when it finally arrived in the mail and I put it on. When the picture froze up within the first 5 minutes I was not happy. So I returned it and when I got the new copy. THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED! It froze up before Madonna made her entrance!!! So by now I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! So I eturned it again and then I find out that I am getting a refund. It was no longer in stock, So needless to say. This was really demented.",1386374400,2,562,3.93859649122807
5848068,3,B00DQVST76,"I have all Madonna's DVD concerts, this one's sound was the most overlayed dubed in vocals of the few. I didn't like that, the concert itself was ok..in a true diva way. I alway want to see the dancer's on how they adutitions for the gig,and this didn't do it. It show's alittle but to much editing.",1386028800,,299,4.2631578947368425

5848072,5,B00DQVST76,"Quick comment I got this the day of the Bru-Ray release. There were no defects. However throughout the disc as well as on the Epix vers. different lighting effects, photo tricks,(eg.: Instagram) were used. I think this confused some of the viewers.",1385683200,2,248,4.928571428571429
5848074,1,B00DQVST76,The sound and visual quality of the DVD is really bad. The editing is a complete hatchet job with total disregard to seamless continuity and picture quality. The change from colour to black&white in some songs is truly irritating and detracts from the live feel of the show. The use of photos during Like a Virgin and Love Spent is totally ridiculous. What is the point of including a photo album in the middle of a video of a live performance? Seems like Madonna has truly lost her sense of distinguishing quality from crap.,1384819200,,525,4.595744680851064
5848075,4,B00DQVST76,Madonna's MDNA Tour is really good. My copy I bought the DVD version played perfectly. Her song choices were well chosen. It looks like the dvd is currently out of print. If your an fan of Madge this is an must have for you DVD collection.,1384387200,,239,4.217391304347826

5848077,2,B00DQVST76,"Even though MDNA world tour followed one of her weakest albums to date (is it any wonder that the Confessions tour is her best tour so far?), she still knows how to put on a really good show. I was pretty much pleased with the 5.1 sound and thank God for that.
I have read many comments regarding the editing of the blu-ray, but I thought ""How bad can it be?"" and I was probably hoping that some people just can't handle some fast editing. Well, I was wrong. The editing is ""What were they thinking?"" bad. EVERY SINGLE SECOND is pretty much a cut. Show the crowd - CUT - show a dance move - CUT - show the video playing in the background - CUT. It is just exhausting watching this. The choreography of her concerts is always impressive, but you can't really follow it here, which is a huge shame. I wished that they had put a camera in a corner, filmed the whole thing and just released it as it is.
Madonna can still dance and do amazing things on stage, which is more than enough for their fans, but not for her. The lighting is such that you can never really see her face clearly, it's like a ball of light through which you can make out the eyes and the mouth. At some point in the concert, during which she is pretty much undressed, the picture converts into grainy black and white - suspicious timing. If only she could just embrace her age and just let the blu-ray show every wrinkle, she is still a performer on stage that overshadows many of her younger peers.
If the editing was proper and the image quality clearer, so that one could actually enjoy watching this show, I would have given it a rating of 4 out of 5.",1384214400,2,1625,4.211538461538462
5848078,1,B00DQVST76,"HORRIBLE QUALITY.
The Brightness, Contrast, Color and Sharpness are out of place and UNBELIEVABLE BAD. I tried the BluRay in THREE DIFFERENT PLAYERS and even at Best Buy.

5848080,5,B00DQVST76,"Queen of Pop.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  She is the world's greatest performer.  I would say that to date my favorite concert of hers is The Confessions Tour, but I love this one, too.  There is a lot going on. The staging is insane.  It puts me to shame, honestly.  How can I be less than half her age and feel exhausted watching her?  Anyway, amazing show.  Amazing hard-working woman.  Can't wait for her next tour.",1383609600,2,424,4.265822784810126

The sound is great. Some people complain about the ""grain"" in the video. They used a high-contrast on the video but the detail is great. Many movies go for the high-contrast (300) some people don't like it, some people don't mind it. It can always be adjusted for your own preference. I am surprised Amazon hasn't combined the links so people can more easily find the new fixed version. Instead people  may still be buying the defective version from other sellers.

But the quality of the sound and picture on this disc is probably the worst I've seen since Kylie released her X-Tour a few years back. The editing is so fast (often several times in a second!) you can hardly see any expressions on Madonna's face, which is also so white and pale caused by an ""instagram-filter"" color grading, which in my opinion ruins the whole thing. The film is grey and grainy compared to the colorful and sharp show I saw live on stage. The sound of the cheering audience is also put on top of the audio, which is so annoying I don't know what to say. This is obviously not from the live recording of the show, cause I cannot remember the crowd shouting, screaming and applauding non-stop for 2 hours, which this release want you to believe - and at the same time totally ruin the sound of the film. It is no secret that the footage is taken from several different shows, but it is a bit annoying to watch her clothes and hair alter from one picture to the other during the same song. Very very dissapointed about this realease. I was so looking forward to show this to my friends who didn't go to the show, but this release don't do the MDNA show justice.

5848176,4,B00DQVST76,"I almost hate to be that annoying guy who comes on here and smugly proclaims ""Everything worked fine for me!"" but the truth is, this Blu-Ray really did work just fine for me, lol. In fact, anticipating the horror to come after reading so many bad reviews, I actually bought the DVD version as well, and now that I've had to chance compare them both firsthand, I must say that  the Blu-Ray really does put the DVD to shame in nearly every way. (Well, maybe not every way. The disc menu is a total nightmare to navigate and it took maybe a minute of random button pushing just to get the thing to play at all, but once it did, we were kosher.) Now, I don't know a thing about surround sound or fancy speakers or anything like that, but as far as just popping the disc into a standard player with standard settings, everything looked and sounded wonderful. True, there's a good amount of grain that's noticeable when the image is predominately dark, mostly with audience shots, but that's pretty par for the course with Blu-Rays today, and when focusing on the stage and Madonna herself, the colors are bright and vibrant and crisp. At times the audio also sounds ""off,"" like perhaps it was re-dubbed post-production, but I'm inclined to say that's due more in part to poor editing choices than actual technical defects. At least it was clear. Now I'm not saying that the other 95% of the people complaining here are mistaken in their concerns, since obviously enough people experienced legitimate problems to warrant an official recall of this product, but who knows, maybe I just got lucky.

In regards to the concert itself, it's just phenomenal. I'm a lifelong admirer of Madonna - with the tattoo to prove it, lol - but have also learned to look at her with a more objective and critical eye in recent years. The Hard Candy album was an embarrassing, awful mess on every level, and MDNA was a mixed bag to say the least. (The songs that are good are REALLY good, but the songs that are bad are REALLY bad.) The subsequent MDNA tour, however, proved once again that in spite of her waning musical inspirations, she is still unmatched as a live performer and you can't help but be left breathless. In fact, I even left the show with a newfound appreciation for some songs that up until that point I only considered filler, such as I'm a Sinner and Turn Up the Radio. Most of the ""Madonna classics"" such as Vogue and Express Yourself are played straight, as opposed to the Sticky and Sweet Tour where everything was remixed beyond recognition, which I admit was a nice change this time around. Like a Virgin was slowed way down, and in conjunction with the nearly acapella Love Spent, made for the most poignant segment of the night - although I absolutely hate the way that part was edited for home release. (Still photos? Really?) In fact you'll probably find the editing in general to be a bit jarring at first; I don't think any single camera shot lingers for more than one or two seconds at a time. It's definitely a fast-paced flurry of images that perhaps tries a bit too hard to be stylish, and the ""feels like I'm there"" concept is totally tossed out the window, but it's a fun ride while it lasts and you'll still appreciate the fact that when it comes to live performances, even after all these years, Madonna truly invests everything she's got and doesn't settle for anything less than epic.",1380067200,4,3402,4.55718954248366

My problem with MDNA Concert is soo much editing. There has to be a thousand cuts or more in this DVD. Things flashing at you off the screen, I just felt alot of it was just really unnecessary. That's probably why so many are having problems with menu screen and sound quality on blu-ray because they focused so much on editing the show they were liable to screw something up! Sure the sticky and sweet tour was edited heavily but they went way overboard with this one. A concert experience is supposed to be like feeling like you are actually there. But this is edited so much you might as well be watching a music video. It's just cut after cut after cut after cut after cut after cut, switch scene switch scene, stuff flashing at you, scene switch, scene switch, cut, cut, flash, flash, flash, flash, cut, cut... I mean come on! I will watch it a couple times to see if my review will change but as it stands I give it a 3 star...

5848183,3,B00DQVST76,"A few days ago, I received my copy of the MDNA TOUR Blu-ray, shipped all the way from the US to BKK, Thailand. I was so worried after reading all the negative reviews regarding the teachnical problem of the release and prayed that I would have received a perfect copy but no.. mine has the same problem - defective audio as others mentioned. I decided to buy a dvd copy release here in Thailand. Unfortunately, the same problem!! So, to confirm the 5.1 DTS/HD DTS doesn't work. Now it's quite clear that it's global issue.
Regarding the video content, at first my US Blu-ray copy looked very bad too on my HD TV. I was so disappointed that nothing seemed to work well but after reading the following statement from Interscope, I tried to set my TV display to ""Normal Mode"" and put all the enchanement & extra picture control options to off or low. Then the picture quality seems to pop up as it should - sharp, clear, no grains, realistic color and definitely up to 1080p HD resolution. There are some scences that have extra filters and movie-effect grains but they're all intentional and artistic choice.
Finally, I'm happy with picture at least. I wouldn't send back copy for exchange but sometime later I'd just buy myself a new copy when a proper release is due in the future.

5848195,4,B00DQVST76,"I will keep this short. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the editing makes the concert look less like a concert and more like a music video. Madonna's face has been given special editing so that the lighting looks so bright you aren't able to see imperfections (which I am sure was the purpose). It does not look raw or real like a concert DVD should. The Sticky and Sweet and Confessions Tour DVDs weren't as heavily ""Photoshopped"" as this one.

There are certain scenes where the camera angles could have been better to give a much more realistic feel to what the intention of the super large screens were meant to do in the live setting. I went to this concert in Phoenix, AZ and the screens are as much the star as Madonna is in certain performances. I don't know if this was done to make it less controversial since the backdrop gets bloody in a performance or what but it seems like a no-brainer to me to keep the spirit of that performance alive on the live DVD.

All that being said, four stars is fours stars. That is still a stellar grade for a performance anyone is sure to enjoy. I don't believe it is in any way possible not to appreciate the artistry that goes in to this performance and, furthermore, it's just so fun and entertaining to watch.

5848198,1,B00DQVST76,"For those wondering if the DVD is defective I can assure you that it unfortunately is. The video quality is fine but the sound is defective.  The 5.1 sound does not work! What a disappointment. I just could not enjoy the concert.  Which is a shame because it is an amazing tour. I can't believe that we are given such bad quality products. And Madonna herself kept posting on Facebook & Instagram that they were working extremely hard to get this done. Well I simply don't believe it. I don't see that so-called hard work.
What I saw was mostly great but I did have some issues with the editing. It simply was not the best compared to Confessions or Sticky & Sweet. It seemed to jump from one frame to another frame to another too quickly. If you look at the Turn Up The Radio performance, in one frame she has long sleeves and in another frame she has no sleeves?!?! The editing was not consistent. I just kept thinking about Confessions and how beautifully that was done.

I love the MDNA era but it simply is not being handled properly. The number of singles chosen (and yes I am aware that usually only 2 or 3 singles are usually chosen for Madonna) but I was hoping for more this time around. The lack of physical CD singles available. I'm in America, why must I keep having to purchase from the UK or Japan? I thought Madonna leaving Warner Bros. was gonna bring a change in the handling of Madonna's career but it seems like not much has changed.

I am a huge Madonna fan and I will always be. But I just dislike the people who are handling her career. This means you Guy Oseary!

UPDATE: I returned my DVD and received a new one. SAME ISSUE! This 2nd DVD I received is also faulty. And I just noticed that Amazon is no longer selling the DVD anymore. Only through third-party sellers. We'll see how long it takes to fix these Blu-rays/DVDs. Madonna herself has addressed the issue as well as Interscope. Although they are quickly blaming the settings & firmware. Do I have to spend my hard earned money & purchase a new Blu-ray player? According to Interscope, YES. Best solution is for them to stop releasing faulty products.

I was in denial when I read that there was no sound coming out from of the right surround speaker or the Low Frequency Effects (LFE) / Subwoofer channel until I played it in my system

The video is amazing and it cannot be compared with any other source, however the sound is something else... MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE... Perhaps Madonna allowed Rocco to play with the console??

Unreal that LiveNation or InterScope allowed to release this Blu-Ray without even bother doing Quality Assurance (QA) to the DTS-HD Master Audio track

The other audio-tracks are ok, but mediocre, the sound level is so low, that you have to crank up the volume of your receiver.

I think the audio-track was somehow OVERCOOKED. I attended the concert in Toronto Canada and have videos shot with my iPhone and those have better audio and BASS BASS plenty of BASS. I believe they re-recorded or cleaned up the soundtrack excessively

I've seen videos in YouTube with better audio-editing

The menus of the disc are crap as well. Bad bad bad usability and it is hard to navigate through them

And, in all fairness, I have a Bose `Cinemate' for audio purposes, which does not feature a 5.1 sound option, so... But the regular stereo option was clear, booming and all encompassing - my living room shook as she took the stage to the opening strains of `Girl Gone Wild.'

Yes, the filtered, `Instagrammed' look of the video itself is a bit distracting initially, but after making 2 minor adjustments to my televisions hi-def settings, the picture was dramatically improved and after a few songs, I forgot about the issue entirely and enjoyed the show. That stated, I will be returning my BD copy, once the sound issue has been corrected accordingly.

Madge is at the top of her show-stopping game with this theatrical, over-the-top, bombastic presentation and both she and her set/sound designers have never looked or sounded better. The woman is an undeniable, unstoppable force of nature and this Miami show demonstrates her prowess down to the last fine detail.

Watch the MDNA Tour on Blu-Ray (my copy is perfectly fine, image or audio-wise) and you will know the kind of showmanship that this one-woman wonder is associated with. Once on the stage whether belting out old tunes or new, the stage is hers. While others often say people only pay to watch Madonna perform her old hits, I beg to differ. Madonna's catalog is so vast that a 2-hour show will not be able to accommodate but she expertly weaves in elements of old songs into her new songs and the majority of MDNA is sung here. Look carefully - her fans are able to sing her new songs, which have an added dynamism live, too. There's no doubt this woman sings live too - watch Like a Virgin Waltz and Like A Prayer where she borrows the voices of her fans on many lines. Last but not least, I am utterly amazed at the energy this woman possesses and how she contorts her body almost like a seasoned gymnast to perform! If any of today's female artistes can take their careers this far, they can take away her throne. In the meantime, Madonna is QUEEN!",1379635200,5,1130,4.360189573459715

5848210,5,B00DQVST76,"Others have commented on technical flaws, so all I need do is acknowledge they are there.

How can I give five stars in the face of such technical difficulties? Simply because this is a drop-dead gorgeous show.  I saw it three times from the Golden Triangle, and this DVD really does capture so much of the excitement I felt then and there.  Madonna typically puts on a brilliant show, and this one is considered by many fans to be her best tour ever. I know people who really are not Madonna fans and who see many shows--when they saw the MDNA Tour they said--""That's one of the best shows I've ever seen."" And really, it's a show more akin to Broadway than to a typical pop concert.

Madonna skillfully picked some remixes of her new work that translated beautifully to the stage. ""Give Me All Your Luvin' was off the hook, as was the finale, ""Celebration"". She also reworks her past hits in such novel ways. Who else would have seen ""Hung Up"" as a song about being a hostage? The acoustic version of ""Open Your Heart"" is breathtaking--I've never heard it sound like such a beautiful song. I have not yet seen how ""Like A Virgin"" translates onto DVD, but in concert, the role she assumes of a world-weary woman who has seen too much made the tune the emotional highpoint of the concert. The video interludes she created were also artful.

This is the only place I can give this brilliant tour a review that will stand and be seen into the future. So, even with some of the sound issues and the occasional odd edit, I give it five stars.",1379548800,2,1538,4.420494699646643

 We rec'd it and first obstacle is the poorly authored menu set-up. Unless you hit left curser, you can't get into the set-up menu.
Next curious authoring decision. Audio defaults to DTS 2.0 {Have not seen this in a long, long time.}
 Select DTS HD 5.1 audio and all you get are left front and rear, and muffled bass with no right channel info. Confermed this with 5 other properly mastered blu-rays. Obviously, the blu-ray house that issued this never QC'd the final mixes / product.
  This is the masterpiece that Madonna and Guy and crew spent months mixing and editing ?
 I personally think this was a ""quicky"" done by an ""MTV wannabee video editor"" with the most annoying jump cuts, 40% low def camera shots edited in, bizarre filtering, washed out color. What the heck where they thinking ?
 Honestly, there are few youtube hand held camera videos of this tour that have 90% more ""be there"" quality, and somewhat passable audio quality.
 If this is what Mizz M and crew think is a hi-def blu-ray experience then I guess her day has come and gone.

5848224,5,B00DQVST76,"""Grainy"", ""poor quality"", ""VHS quality"" ""bad sound"", etc: These are just some of the descriptions of the MDNA Tour concert Blu-Ray from Madonna. My copy arrived today. My reaction: First, there are three audio tracks; the first is an HD-Audio that is supposed to be 5.1 surround sound. It is NOT. In fact it sounds like both the front and real channels are missing on one side. Again, the front left and the rear left are completely SILENT. However, select AUDIO TRACK 2, and you get a GREAT sounding 2-channel stereo, that will break up into a surround environment. It sounds wonderful; as good as any concert that I've heard in 2.0 and the surround information is vibrant and exciting. As for the VIDEO, honestly I don't know what some of these comments are all about! The concert is VERY colorful and appears to be utilizing various filters for a more FILMIC effect. In fact this entire concert looks like a FILM, and that is a very good thing. I didn't find any of this to look ""grainy"" and the very notion that it looks ""washed out"" or like ""VHS"" is just ludicrous. Although I wish there was a proper HD 5.1 audio option, I am very happy with the audio and video on this Blu-Ray. Perhaps my copy is corrected from what others have seen, but since my sound is defective as well, I dare-say that I have received and now seen, exactly what veryone else has seen. As for the concert itself, here are some one-word adjectives: ""UNBELIEVABLE!"" ""STUNNING"" ""INTENSE"" ""BEAUTIFUL"" and finally, a more 'complete' reaction: The MDNA tour is ferocious, fearless and mind-blowing throughout! The visuals are absolutely wild.

5848225,1,B00DQVST76,I am so sad to write a review like this.  MDNA was an AMAZING show and I was so excited to get my BD.  But the picture quality is hopelessly flawed and must be rectified.  There is clearly and error in the production of the BD around the world.  This much be fixed ASAP.  I am now on my second defective copy from Amazon.  There are tons of reviews that discuss this issue yet it seems Amazon isn't doing anything about it except exchanging defective discs with other defective discs.

5848226,1,B00DQVST76,"I recently purchased the MDNA World Tour Blu Ray and believe the disc to be defective. The 5.1 audio track seems to be mixed incorrectly; there is no sound from the front-right and rear-right channels, and very little sound from the subwoofer channel. I know of many people within the United States that have purchased this Blu Ray and have been posting on forums about this issue. I wanted to help bring this defective Blu Ray to the attention of whoever is able to offer a corrected replacement. It seems that not every stock of every country it was released has been affected but most of the people who have purchased this Blu Ray within the U.S. have had problems. Please help to get this issue to the attention of the right people.",1379289600,2,736,4.541353383458647
5848227,5,B00DQVST76,"I couldn't ask for more! Madonna gets another great hit with the release of her MDNA tour. i read some of the reviews about the Blue ray DVD coming defected from production, well i purchased it before reading those reviews, so when i got it delivered i thought i would have to check it out (just in case) and get it ready for a return right away. Well well well, for my surprise i didn't have to, it came ALL RIGHT! everything works fine. the sound and image are great. Yes the image is not as clear as many thought, but for what i can tell is the style of the video, yet is VERY good quality image. it has this ""oldish"" style look, keeping the modernity and color of blue ray. how's that? i love it! it's almost like Madonna and her team went an extra mile on doing something different from the rest. and they did! in my opinion they did a fantastic job. the edition is great, some of the cases i feel like i'm in the show, by the end of any song i'm exhausted, there is so much going on to watch some times. so I recommend this product sincerely.

I'm guessing some of those who comment against the blue ray dvd were Lady gaga's little monsters since Madonna performs ""Express yourself"" and ""Born this way"" in the same song proving gaga copied that song sound from ""Express yourself"" adding in the end a piece of ""She's not me"" song.

So anyone who fears or is hesitant to buy the blue ray dvd i would say go for it. i don't think a company would let this happen specially someone so powerful and influential like Madonna. But if that's the case of a defected DVD you can always return it. no big deal. I'm sure they are taking notes on the issues people write here.

The blue ray DVD is alright, there is nothing wrong with it.",1379289600,2,1730,4.204819277108434
5848228,4,B00DQVST76,"I will make this simple.
I have been her fan since the beginning, and I have been a disappointed fan for the last years, especially after Timbaland's productions on Hard Candy. On her favor, Duran Duran were also victims, with a bigger disaster as a result... Therefore I had little to no good expectations at all.
But I was wrong; the quality of the show's production is over any other of her previous tours. I don't care if she did playback all over the show (who doesn't do it these days). The stage, the dancers, the choreographies, the segments, the wardrobe (specially Gaultier's designs for the 3rd segment): simply flawless. Not thrilled about the songs selection, but I understand it was the promotion of the MDNA album.
And undeniably, the co-star of the show: Rocco! He has the charms! And which mother wouldn't be proud of having her son next to her in front of millions?

But Madonna ALLOWED iphones into her concert and as a result Youtube is saturated with all the realistic concert experience footage you could possibly want. So this is different. And as with everything else she does, way better than anything we could get from mediocre talent of today's coattail riders.

AND you'll love the behind-the-scene footage at the end giving us a peak of how she escapes, probably to her hotel or airport. Brilliant.",1379203200,,634,4.711711711711712

Although I must admit that the editing was overdone it kind of steals the artistry that was showcased during the live concert with wrong angles at times that don't seem to be in place, or camera not focusing on Madonna when it should have.

5848238,5,B00DQVST76,"With humility, I confess that I have had the good luck of being able to attend multiple concerts.  Madonna's 2012 tour stop in the Washington D.C. area was one of them, and I would easily rate her live performance as one of the top three best concerts (that I attended).  ""Madonna's MDN World Tour"" dvd is a continuation of the musical intensity and energy she puts out to give fans of her music an exhilarating show.  She creatively opens the show with various dancers dressed in red robes and eloquently closes with an energetic rendition of ""Celebration"".  Additionally, I found it heartwarming when Madonna took the time after ""Open Your Heart"" to thank her fans.  ""I Don't Give A"", ""Express Yourself"", ""Vogue"", ""Erotic Candy Shop"", and ""Human Nature"" are some of my favorite performances from this dvd. However, the following is the complete concert track listing for those who prefer more information on the songs that were performed (in sequential order): Virgin Mary (Intro), Girl Gone Wild, Revolver, Gang Bang, Papa Don't Preach, Hung Up, I Don't Give A, Best Friend, Express Yourself, Give Me All Your Luvin, Turn Up The Radio, Open Your Heart, Masterpiece, Justify My Love, Vogue, Erotic Candy Shop, Human Nature, Like A Virgin, Love Spent, Nobody Knows Me, I'm Addicted, I'm A Sinner, Like A Prayer, and Celebration.",1379116800,,1329,4.941704035874439

I know, that is a bit of a stretch maybe...but my copy was just fabulous.  It couldn't look or sound better, the editing is imaginative...this might be her best show ever.  WAAAAAAYYYY better than Sticky and Sweet.  That being said, I did download the audio on iTunes and that is in fact wretched.  But I would recommend buy the blu ray if you are a real fan.

5848246,1,B00DQVST76,"I had bought my copy of the Blu from Best Buy the day of release. I have since exchanged it twice. The picture has these snow storm like images and noise lines much like a VHS. Now when watched on the DVD these are not noticeable or even in the HD broadcast from Epix. Yes there are artistically used filters and grain but the blu is so extreme and different this can not be right? NOw as for the sound. My system shows the 5.1 as decoding right but there is little to no sound from any of the right channels and faintly from center. I am familiar with how 5.1 works and own plenty of Blu ray movies with no issue. In fact I bought the Star Trek blu same day Beautiful surround sound, so why is the MDNA blu so messed up? There are three options for audio if you play option 2 it is a two channel and has issues if you go to option 3 also two channel, that seems to work. However I paid premium for Blu ray and that means great picture and surround sound. If this is the quality I should have paid .50 cents for a VHS tape. The kicker is that Best Buy will not acknowledge these issue and treat me as if I am crazy. Fans have been contacting Universal, interscope , and tweeting @guyoseary with the same issues but NO one will acknowledge it or some stores will not allow refunds. So Buyer BEWARE! Again this is based on technical qualities not artistic filters and editing. I had the opportunity to see the show in person twice and it was amazing, unfortunate that this issue is tainting Madonna's legacy of perfection and the silence on the issue is disheartening.",1379116800,10,1566,4.223333333333334

With the anticipation of waiting to buy it on DVD/BLURAY...I was very disappointed with the editing. :( Please understand that when people buy concert DVD/BLURAY we are expecting a concert point of view...not a over-produced music video!!!
Yes...editing and sound editing is needed to get the best video angles and a proper mix of stage sound and crowd noise but we still want to see a concert to make us feel like we are actually there watching from the arena seats...not like watching a over-produced version looking like a music video!!! There are TOO MANY video cut in and cut out and panning in and out...for example...""The Girlee Show"" was a really good edit of a Madonna Concert!!! ""The Drowned World Tour DVD"" also a good edit of the concert even with the special video effects added to it...""The Confessions Tour DVD"" also a good edit of a Madonna concert with all the extra special video effects that don't take away from the concert viewing experience!!! The editing on ""MDNA TOUR"" is OVERKILL!!! If Madonna plans to sell another concert DVD version of the MDNA TOUR concert that shows more of the concert and less video editing I WOULD TOTALLY BUY IT!!!

I have the CyberLink PowerDVD 13 software and with some audio adjustments I actually got the right audio balance and bass boosted quite significantly!! I didn't even expect it to work. I'm now enjoying the show!!

The only thing is that this works for me while watching it on my Sony VAIO (laptop). So this does me really well for now until the fixed product gets released (hopefully soon so I can watch it on my 5.1 Surround system).

The audio adjustments (if you have the PowerDVD software): 1) Go to Audio Settings; 2) Make ""Output"" set to ""Headphones""; 3) then More Audio Settings; 4) Output Mode: Set this to ""TrueTheater Surround""; 5) Then under ""TrueTheater Surround Options"" choose ""Theater""; 6) Then under that you'll have ""Dynamic Range Compression"" - Choose ""Boosted for noisy environments (highly recommended for notebooks).

The difference is great!

I was going to rate this Blu-ray PRODUCT (not the show!) just 1 star for bad quality audio, but now that I fixed this I can enjoy the concert better than the way it previously sounded. I will rate it 5 stars when they get this Blu-ray fixed. Until then, I give it a 4.
I really hope this helps. It's better than having to wait for the next reissue. I really hope this helps for a lot of you, because as a Madonna fan, I know how it is to be impatient over this setback, especially after the long wait. Good luck!",1379116800,,1584,4.602836879432624

5848268,5,B00DQVST76,"Well, I just got my BR from US, and I am very happy with the sound and image. It is the best concert BR so far. I have a Denon reciever 11.2 170 watts per channelSanyo 70""3d and BR Cambridge azur 751 Multichannel,
The 1st section is filmed as tarantino's movies but after that, image is so clear and perfect, feels like I would at the golden trangle with a lot of details.

It has DTS HD 5.1 MA, if you play it here, you will miss the back up singers , just going to hear the main vocals, on this just Madonna, it is happen with all the rest of concert BR that I have and some of them like one from BOn Jovi, George MIchael and EAgles, sound very awful. So it is normal . But this one fom Madonna is so far better from the rest
DTS HD Stereo, if you want to hear all sounds and back uo voclas, play this
DTS, just the normal as DVD, sound ok, the other 2 are better

Actually all the 3 options sound so perfect for me. The only diference is depend of what kind of sound do you prefer, on my case I do prefer the DTS M 5.1 because I can hear the Madonna's vocals so neat and clear , specially on Masterpiece, LV and LS. It is happen the same with Sticky and the other 20 live concerts that i have, but for me MDNA is better than the rest of my collection. I am so happy with this BR and I am on my way on the 3rd time watchining today and can not get enough....",1379030400,2,1360,3.8362989323843415

5848271,5,B00DQVST76,"I just viewed the Blu ray product of the MDNA tour of Madonna and its fantastic ! She did a great show and the final product on this Blu ray is excellent ! She did an excellent job editing all the footage and making them more engaging to watch.
I did notice that it took almost two minutes for the Sharp Blu ray player to read the disc, but after that, everything went smoothly. The video is definitely shot high definition 1080p. I did notice though that the TV or the Bluray player rendered the video at 24hz instead of the usual 120 hz.  This may be that disc requires a TV that can render the film in 24 fps. My Sharp TV bought five years ago can render that, as well as my Sharp Blu ray player. I'm not sure if all HDTVs have that capability but that may be the reason why I'm seeing issues being posted about the blu ray version of the concert film.

(My Sharp TV and blu ray player have the latest firmware updates and connected to a Sony sound bar.
I also choose the Master HD 2.0 audio option for playing on the sound bar.)

Update 09/14/13: Since I play the disc using the DTS Master 2.0 option, I don't see the issue with regards to the 5.1 audio setting. My suggestion, try checking each speaker. The Maxell Blu Ray player cleaner also has audio check settings that will check the configuration of each speaker.  Otherwise, just enjoy the concert in Master HD 2.0.

After speaking to others that purchased it, I have found the DVD version is not that much better and also has issues.  Also... if there is anyone thinking about buying the ""audio CD"" or digital version... DON'T... it is pure garbage as well and you will be disappointed with it.  The ""audio cd"" and digital versions are the exact audio master used to make the Blue Ray & DVD SO THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES!!!  I purchased the digital album from Itunes and am just a disappointed in it as the blu ray as it is the same crap master recording (I have already reported the issue to iTunes and have asked for refund... which they have promptly issued due to the multiple complaints posted there as well).... Like everyone else. I am disappointed with the sound/recording of Blue Ray and will more than likely be returning it in the hopes that it is rereleased.

It was dark, creepy, almost eerily icky in nature--like watching an aging Moulin Rouge tart cavorting about with youngsters in some creepy Stephen King horror concert movie. (Almost camp, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show.)  There are a few very good dance numbers in a couple of presentations, and one must credit Madonna for staying in shape and keeping at it, but as far as an entertaining, fun and light-spirited concert event goes, forget it.  Not at all a light-hearted fun filled event like the Confessions Tour, this concert was just a slick mess of noisy over-produced lip-synched electronic schlock.

5848286,1,B00DQVST76,"The show itself is amazing and I love the editing and techniques used. Madonna did an amazing job.
Interscope/Universal did a disgusting job making this disk. Without pointing out the lazy and superficial effort put into making the artwork,

1- Menu is amateurish, poorly designed and you cant really distinguish the selection options because the text is white and the highlight selection is a light gray.

2- Video quality of the DVD is blurred and poor, you feel like you are whatching an 80s VHS tape and you cant barely see Madonnas facial expressions or details (and this has nothing to do with the filters) the complexity of the visuals are lost in the DVD.  Blu-ray video quality is painfully grainy (again, nothing to do with the technique or efects) but this can be smoothen by changing the display options on your TV from auto to cinema.

3- Audio quality of DVD is very good. On the Blu-ray audio is terrible. Dolby 5.1 dosent work on one side of the speakers  and you miss some sounds and bass is almost nonexistent up to the point that you don't want to watch it at all.
I was able to compare these two against the Digital Download version of the video and the previous EPIX broadcast. Its so sad and depressing to have such an amazing tour ruined by this horrible oversight.

Vocals are so faded in certain sections that it's hard to even hear if anything is being sung. Instruments appear and disappear in songs (such as Revolver) where you just get a drowned out sound of crowd noise. I have no idea how Universal allowed these discs to be shipped out in the defective state that they're in, but if sound is important to you, then save yourself the time and money and don't purchase this. If you have a defective disc, email Amazon as well as Universal and Live Nation and let them know about the issue so that they can start an exchange program.

Echoing like crazy.. like your sitting in the last row and at times (her vocal) the only thing you can hear.  Not cute.  On top of that the picture is filtered/processed to the max! Extremely washed out.  Overexposed to the point that all you can see is Madonna's eyes and lips.  And the editing.. OMG!  I follow her on facebook and remember her posting how hard they were working on the editing and equalizing of the colors and picture.  She personally oversaw the production of MDNA.  WTH!?  The camera never stays put for more than a few seconds.  It truly makes you dizzy.

I saw this tour from her Golden Triangle and it was freaking amazing!  I planned a whole party around the release of this bluray.  I have a reference quality system.  Sticky & Sweet is one of the most amazing concerts.  I play it all the time for people and they are blown away.  Crystal clear picture and the most amazing sound!

Amazon is sending me another copy but I don't have high hopes.  I guess I can live with the picture but the lack of a right channel of sound along with no bass completely ruins the experience.  I bet you Madonna is furious right now.  Her fans certainly are.  There should be an address where you mail this defective disc and get a guaranteed non-defective replacement.  Looks like I'll be cancelling my viewing party.  Ugh!

**UPDATE**

Well I got my replacement/second copy and it's another dud!  Frustrating.  How many copies will I go through before I get a good one?!  Here's hoping to third times the charm.  BTW, this is not unique to Amazon.  Best Buy is dealing with the same issue.  Can somebody get this fixed please?!

**UPDATE 2**

I'm SOL at this point.  They are not even gonna try a third time.  They have canceled my order and refunded my money.  So much for the getting the best price when I preordered.  Damn, I want a good copy!  Don't know what to do at this point.  :(

There are parts where the video and audio are not synchronized.  You can tell that her lips are singing something else while the audio is 3 seconds behind.

With 11 cameras filming this performance, you would imagined that the high school AV club that worked on the editing had ample footage to put together a decent DVD.  However, the picture quality is horrible; because it was filmed in digital.  First time that this is done for any Madonna tour.  You can tell that the image quality is lacking and not near Blue Ray.  But in the span of 5 seconds the high school AV club that edited this will show you six different camera angles.  So you get a really annoying constant flash of images that make no sense and completely destroy her performance.  At times, you see more audience and more dances than Madonna.

At the start of just about every song, when Madonna should be on your screen, the high school AV club that edited this shows you the audience or some crazy faced backup dancer spazing out on stage.  Just take a look at Vogue.  When she comes out, the high school AV club that edited this shows you something else...over and over...but barely any Madonna.

I do like that she chose to use the audio track feeding from her microphone.  So you actually get to hear her and not some auto-tune box.  Without a doubt her performance is beyond phenomenal and no one comes close.  But the editing is so horrible...so painfully horrible.

In all media players, and on both the ripped and standard DVD, the 5.1 audio track was missing its right-front channel. And yes, *I* know how to fix the issues, but that doesn't mean everyone will.

That said, I was surprised how grainy some of the footage was, especially compared to her previous tour videos. I also agree with a great many fans that these videos are getting way too overproduced, because the performance here is truly one of her best and her sound is coming through much cleaner than her last few tours. Perhaps an extra ""angle"" track just showing a variety of steady shots would appease both sides? Thankfully I was able to watch the ""Madonna MDNA Tour Full Concert (Europe Version)"" on YouTube which was a surprisingly well-edited sequence of mostly camera-phone footage (and audio) which actually seemed more impressive in terms of depicting the performance at hand, despite the abysmal quality.

It looks like the DVD version is correct, even the picture quality surpasses the blu-ray, which only points out that there is a problem with blu-ray pressing.",1378771200,94,917,4.767295597484277
5848321,2,B00DQVST76,I received it today and had my heart broken cause the sound on the BlurRay is totally off. Returning it for the DVD and hoping it sounds better.,1378771200,5,144,4.178571428571429
5848323,1,B00DQVST76,"I read one review warning about the Bluray of the show being of very poor picture quality. Mine is terrible. It looks like a bad cellphone recording. I heard the DVD isn't like this so I am gonna try that route.

I love the show. The editing is fine. I'd rather see the show as it was performed without the restructuring of editing, but that isn't the way it is done.

The sound on my Bluray is also not in complete stereo.

I am returning the Bluray and trying the DVD. I think the many positive reviews of the Bluray were written before those folks saw it. It was only released today. They are giving positive reviews to the awesomeness of the show and Madonna. I agree the show is awesome and so is my girl; but this product is a disaster. At least my copy and apparently others.

UPDATE: 9/12/13 I have the DVD now. It is of much better picture quality than the Bluray; but it is still not good video. I don't know if it is the way it was filmed or the way they produced the DVDs and Blurays, but video quality is not doing the show any favors. As for the sound, it is not complete stereo. I have awesome equipment and you cannot get loud concert sound out of either the Bluray or DVD. No Bass to be had on my DVD or Bluray.

I have sent the Bluray back and received the refund. I'll keep the DVD as it is better than nothing. I'll hope for a better release. With all of the negative feedback who knows what might happen.

Now I'll buy the audio CDs and see if they sound right. LMAO Long live the Queen!",1378771200,54,1508,4.112244897959184

This is a brilliant concept and a complete journey perfectly made by Madonna and her team. She go trough her faces and you can see the whole concept and congruence in her art. Shes not just a performer, shes a truly artist with a message. A concert full music and visual art mixing pop classic and new song of this remarkable artist. There's only one Queen, and that's Madonna B*tch!",1378771200,,487,4.191489361702128

5848327,1,B00DQVST76,"I spent the whole time watching this concert squinting... trying to see what was going on through a veil of filters, haze, slow motion, montages, etc.  It's like watching a movie in a room full of smoke or cobwebs.  Why not just film the thing in high quality high definition with good camera angles and let the performance speak for itself?  If it's just due to cover her age, get over it.  Fans know how old she is, and we don't care.  We don't expect her to look 20.  She looks great.  I should not buy a blu ray at 1080 pixels to then wonder why there is film grain and effects like I am watching this on YouTube at 360 pixels or lower.  Please, re-release a version of all Madonna concerts post 2001 with mild editing and no effects.  This is just awful.  Just film the stage please!  I didn't even make it to the end.  It gives me a headache trying to figure out what is happening on the stage because the performance seems a million miles away!  I'm sure the concert was great - I guess I'll never know.

UPDATE:
Also, as others have stated, the surround sound on the blu ray is terrible!  I have a 5.1 surround sound system, and kept having to get up to check if my speakers were working.  The bass is almost non-existant and her voice sounds very muffled and has a lot of echo like it is in a tin can.  I first thought it was to match the video looking like it was shot on someone's cheap cell phone, but now realize it is defective audio.  I really cannot recommend this product at all.  Her releases just keep getting botched (remember the Celebration Video Collection quality?).  If you have the chance to see Madonna live, do it!  It's a true experience you will never forget.  But it seems the days of her concerts being presented in a high quality video format are over.  It's such a shame and lost opportunity!  It didn't have to be this difficult to appropriately record and present the show in the highest quality.  The frustrating thing is, you know the footage exists to do this.",1378771200,3,1999,4.32345013477089
5848330,3,B00DQVST76,"Bluray / DVD looks so soft, so instagram, the video is very filtered, and you lost sharpness doing that. The Madonna performance was awesome.

Blame the editors.

5848331,1,B00DQVST76,"Gutted after waiting so long for this (one of Madonna's best ever tours finally available to watch at home) - but I seem to have one of the defective Blu Rays.  Picture looks like an old analogue TV broadcast where the reception was bad. The Blue Ray of this concert is appalling, it is missing audio tracks, so the sound quality is totally terrible, the image is grainy and inferior, something has gone wrong in the duplication of this Blue Ray - Blue Ray is meant to be sharp, crisp, vivid and HD this one looks and sounds worse than an old VHS video copy of a copy.

The tour was amazing, I made it to the pit, I was looking forward to the first Blue Ray of a Madonna concert, the blue rays have been recalled in other countries but not in the US, Live Nation and Universal know there is a problem.

A very bad quality Blue Ray, alas I think the other 5 star reviews were made before they actually saw the Blue Ray and they were reviewing the original tour or the webcast of it NOT the blue ray.

DO not buy the Blue Ray until they reissue a fixed version, it is an utter waste of money.",1378425600,,1090,4.127358490566038

5848334,4,B00DQVST76,"It's official. Madonna's time has come, and I do not mean this in a bad way. Evolution is a part of life in every sense of the word. I watched several segments of this tour, and I just couldn't take anymore. I'm bored, and restless with her performing the same songs/routines on each, and every tour. Am I the only one who's over it? Madonna's songs are divine, but you can pretty much list the songs in your head that will be performed at each event. Whether it be a Tour, or guest appearance. Those same 8 songs will be performed until her death-day.

Being that Madonna is not a supreme vocalist there's only so far she can go with these same 8 songs, this is boring. It's not like a powerhouse who hits different notes each tour, so the songs are never interesting. Especially, when you listen to Madonna year round [as I do]. The newer shows are only subpar, due to age, attitude, and several other factors.

Madonna in her 20's, and 30's was raunchy, hip, and glam. Even into her 40's, she continued to make her mark. Seeing her today, she still looks good, obviously, but, her demeanor has changed. She seems to be a woman who's exhaled, enjoys entertaining, and living in the moment -- versus, getting on stage, dominating a show, and striking a pose after an 8-count/routine. The shows were better when she had more to prove. Clearly, she's past this time in her life, and she should be. She's a Mom in her 50's, having a blast on stage like the 'good ole' days.

Madonna has nothing to prove these days. As a result, her shows are no longer stimulating. It's comparative to when the coyote nails the roadrunner after decades of trying, desperately. Watching him in distress created a great show! It was a thrill to see what writers would pull out of their butts for each new episode. We were constantly on the edge of our seats, anticipating the next show! But, once the Roadrunner is caught, and the glass is now broken -- are we still not over it? Is it imperetive to wait for more, or can we suddenly do without at this point? Any new screen plays would be uninteresting and/or pointless.

As mentioned earlier -- I tune into Madonna in top-form throughout the course of the year. So, to see and/or hear performances such as this tour are uninteresting. However, I do respect that she's fortunate to still be with us, continuing to do what she loves most; getting on stage! It's a beautiful life, and it's great to see she's still living her dream.

Another 'Madonna issue', is that she's not recorded music within the last 5 years that she can age gracefully with. ""Not a good look."" Her latest music is a wreck. For this reason, she's only able to repeatedly perform the same, tired ,'8 or 10' songs in the same fashion every single concert. She's too 'mature' to perform any of her current work, and she's not vocally creative enough to add any interest to the older work. The studio can make you sound 25, but the cameras can't make you look it. Something to consider...

Madonna is gorgeous! she's the greatest, but, this is what is called 'tough-love'. I will not be a sheep for her slaughter. Madonna is just an outter shell of who she used to be, this is her own fault. Her last two records contain no work that she can potentially carry on a decent show with, or none that she looks good performing today. Overall, her current tour is respectable, but nothing I would watch ever again. I expected to hear something that I would desperatley need to convert to MP3, since most of her live shows are known to contain better versions of the studio-recordings. Unfortunately, nothing here is converter-worthy, the actual album is better -- is this saying anything?.

It's frightening, knowing that each of our current popstars are trailing in Madonna's footsteps, recording senseless, or meaningless music with poor craftsmanship, and to know that this is what their catalogs of music will consist of until they're [also] in their 50's. Rihanna, and Britney are the first to cross my mind while thinking of this disaster that's already happening.

Being that Madonna was/is the first Pop/Superstar of her kind the earth wasn't inclined to what an older Madonna would be like by the age of 50. Madonna, Prince, Janet & Michael were the first generation of popstars who took it all to the next level. As of 2013, there is evidence that these individuals do, in fact, age. They aren't these immortal pop-beings as we subconsciously believed. We now will endure an entire generation's worth of children who have been influenced by these greats. As you can see, Janet is smart, she went into hiding. She will no longer be the butt of anyone's jokes.

The point is, things would be different had Madonna steered her own ship instead of working to please a brand, or label -- or, being posessed by dollar signs. She took the gimmick route. Madonna, and my mother share the same birth-year. She looks identical to any of my Mother's acquaintences on stage hopping around singing these adolescent pop songs. I would love to see Madonna actually be more creative. Her older hits are her only leg to stand on and... I won't go any further, this review is getting longer than I wanted it to be, and I'm beginning to feel like I'm repeating myself. Don't wanna sound like a Madonna concert, or anything...

So, was it good? For her age, yes. In general? It was basic. I used to look at Madonna wishing to be like her, someday. Now, I just look at her. Watching this show made me feel like I was on a crew ship, playing Bingo in my golden years while the staff puts on a show. Madonna will forever be my girl, but, after witnessing this tour I can't sit through another one. The next one will be when she's 60 with another party album? I cant, its embarrassing, but who am I? Do what makes YOU happy.

5848348,1,B00DQVST76,"I wrote a review in August because I knew it was an amazing performance by Madonna and had seen some of the Epix footage. Unfortunately what I didn't foresee is that the the audio and the picture quality of the blu ray is just horrendous....so much so that I erased my first review before the release so I could write this one. If you look at all the positive reviews they are ALL before the release date. Like many others are saying, the picture is grainy and is NOT even DVD quality, let alone Blu Ray quality. Some are saying the picture is bad to disguise her age but It was alot more clear in the epix feed from what I saw and I never thought Madonna really cared about her age. The Audio is the worst. Now I understand it's because it doesn't come out of all the speakers. In the beginning when Madonna comes out you can barely hear her, when it's a moment that should be loud. It also has an echo that rings in your ears. There is no base and at times the volume is lower and higher like it's not quite connected. It made it difficult to be able to keep the volume on one setting the whole time. I have a hard time believing that that this would meet Madonna's standards as part of why she takes so long to release stuff is because she spends all this time perfecting it! I'm stuck between what I wanna do. Since all the reviews are the same, exchanging it isn't really going to matter. I hear the DVD is not ""as bad"", however I don't want to settle for a DVD version when I have a big screen HDMI surround sound TV. And I also hear the DVD has defects too anyhow. It's making me think that maybe I should just return it and get a refund. What a major disappointment. If this isn't corrected or acknowledged I will be very upset.

5848350,5,B00DQVST76,"Madonna described the tour as ""the journey of a soul from darkness to light"". It was divided into four sections: Transgression, where guns and violence was the main theme, Prophecy, where a mix of joyful songs that bring people together are performed, Masculine/Feminine, a combination of sensuality and fashion with a few of Madonna's classic songs performed in a French Cabaret-style, and Redemption, which Madonna labeled as ""a big party and celebration"". The tour has received positive reception and critical acclaim.
The tour courted many controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. Lawsuits threatened against Madonna have also been engaged from the tour. The MDNA Tour created immense success at the box office and many venues were instantly sold out. It was dubbed as the highest-grossing tour of 2012 by Billboard. The tour grossed $305.2 million from 88 sold-out shows, becoming the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time THE CONCERT WAS GREAT, AND THE QUEEN MORE THAN AMAZING, THAT IS CALLED CONCERT!!!!

5848360,4,B00DQVST76,"The MDNA tour is Madonna's ninth concert tour that spanned most of 2012 and was named the best-selling tour of 2012.  In terms of production, this show makes up for the weak Sticky & Sweet two year tour saga, but as a whole does not compare to some of Madonna's top tour moments.

The show is broken out into specific sections with specific themes.  The first theme and the opening section of the show is extremely violent, detached, cold and raw.  Madonna defies gravity by dancing and moving to choreography that her younger predecessors wouldn't have ever been able to get through at the rehearsal stage.  Where this first section goes wrong for me is well, the music.  On paper it looks good but it doesn't translate into an energetic experience.
Girl Gone Wild, Revolver, Bang, Papa Don't Preach - (less than one minute), Hung Up - (auto-tuned, slowed down version that allows for Madonna to Slack-line throughout the track) and I Don't Give A -  Madonna comes to the end of her V-shaped catwalk and does her signature guitar (time for a break) part.
Though these are decent tracks on their own, as a whole, there are too many weak tracks in this first section that don't carry this section.  The choreography, on the other hand, is so intense and so precise that the music almost takes a back-seat.  If I were given an opportunity to direct a Madonna show where I could pick just about any track I wanted and directed it how I wanted, I would keep the music in mind as the TOP priority.  Here's my version of a set-list to go along with the theme and choreography of this first section:
Girl Gone Wild
Causing A Commotion (new 2013 version)
Bang
Papa Don't Preach (longer)
Rescue Me
Beautiful Killer

The second section was a majorette theme and really should have been saved for the end of the show.  Here she does a funky rendition of Express Yourself and then goes into the Blaze remix of Give Me All Your Luvin' and then swiftly leaves the stage while the dancers finish out this quick, intense, hi-NRG section.  Pure perfection.

The next section is more guitars, the basque trio supporting her with basque renditions of some classics she hasn't performed in years and more.
Turn Up the Radio - (surprised she turned this one into a guitar performance)
Open Your Heart - (basque version)
Masterpiece
I understand why she picked the tracks she did for this section.  Turn up was one of the stand outs from MDNA.  Open Your Heart is one of her biggest hits and a fan favorite and hasn't been performed since the Blond Ambition Tour. Masterpiece is the theme song of the film she directed, W.E.  I would have preferred a version of Open Your Heart that remained closer to the original.  This one was just a little too ""Riverdance"" and bouncy for me and not as sleek as the original.  Nonetheless I do like that she weaves these unique sounds into her productions and keeps things fresh.

Once the basque section is complete, and after the sexy Justify My Love interlude come to an end, we go into the best version of Vogue that Madonna has done in years.  It takes us back to the days of ""Blond Ambition"" and Madonna gives us some serious attitude.  There's only one problem...one major problem...the best song of the night gets shortened and we lose the third verse and chorus?!?! WHY?  Just as an FYI, she kept the same treatment and length from the Super Bowl performance which was great for that short medley performance but should have been given a full treatment during the MDNA Tour.  She then goes into one of my favorite tracks from 2008's Hard Candy album, Candy Shop.  With that said, putting this song on the set-list was a glaring mistake and a song she should not have done on this tour.  If I were her, I would have gone right into ""Get Together"" from Confessions after Vogue to keep the energy going.  She then performs Human Nature almost identical to the version we were introduced to in 1994 and similar choreography to the video from 1995.  This truly was the best version of Human Nature she has ever choreographed for live performance.  This leads into a strip tease where she removes most of the clothes she started with in this section and the music also gets stripped to just a piano and her singing.  She sings Like A Virgin and Love Spent and does it beautifully backed with classical arrangements from the W.E. soundtrack.

She goes into her standard political video interlude with Nobody Knows Me, a gem from the under-rated American Life album and then comes out on stage performing, I'm Addicted.  This track should have gotten a significantly better treatment than it did and really could have been a stand-out but it missed the mark.  The song ends with the letters ""M"" ""D"" ""N"" ""A"" being chanted over and over.  Im thinking epic performance possibility here.  She then goes into ""I'm A Sinner/Cyberagga"" and she may have fared better if she instead had gone into ""Beautiful Stranger"" or ""Amazing"" or one of the older more popular tracks that ""Sinner"" was modeled after.

She goes into ""Like A Prayer"" which gets the entire house energized and reminds us of her legacy and the legend that she is and then closes the show with her not-so-popular compilation title track, ""Celebration.""  I think she should have considered swapping the order, Celebration first then closing with Like A Prayer.  That would have made for a stronger close.

Overall, this show is better than most shows you will see from any other artist.  The only artist that has put on a show better than this is, well....Madonna.  Watch the Confessions Tour, Reinvention Tour and the iconic, Blond Ambition tour to see some more examples of her genius.

In terms of this blu-ray release, I was rather disappointed.  It is actually worse than the Epix tv airing of the show.  The sound quality is horrifying and there is a clear defect in the video quality.  The style of the shoot itself is also somewhat difficult to watch.  Madonna is over-exposed throughout the entire performance and after being at this show live, I am somewhat surprised at some of the angles chosen during some of the intricate choreography on this recording.  Finally, when will Madonna start adding the backing videos as extras? It is a pure travesty that those are left off as more often than not, those concert back-drops are better videos than some of her music video releases these days.",1375488000,15,6372,4.658318425760286

The songs were cut way to short and most of the recording, all I heard was the crowd and less music. I don't even want to give this one star! Negative five stars is more like it!!
