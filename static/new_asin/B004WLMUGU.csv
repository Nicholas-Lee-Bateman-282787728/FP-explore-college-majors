8445264,5,B004WLMUGU,"Nostalgia Family has done it again! I've purchased several DVDs from this company mainly because I couldn't find the films elsewhere (most are British titles that are not available on region 1 format), and the transfer quality has been good, and sometimes great. This DVD transfer is superb. The overall video quality is excellent---no static, no picture jitters, no blurriness; the contrast is fine---no washouts. This DVD has none of those problems, and the audio is great as well. I'm really impressed with most of the titles coming from Nostalgia Family.",1504137600,2,558,5.142857142857143

8445269,4,B004WLMUGU,"This film out of Ealing Studios kept me engrossed all the way. The story line of one family and their encounters with some not so savory  types is all quite believable for the time. Each family member having their own problems, which, by the end of the film all ties together and clears up in one fell swoop by the police.",1470182400,3,322,4.278688524590164
8445270,4,B004WLMUGU,Better and more compelling than most modern dramas. There's a stunningly beautiful chase through a rail yard toward the end which would not be nearly so striking and effective in color as it is in black and white.,1325462400,10,213,4.631578947368421
