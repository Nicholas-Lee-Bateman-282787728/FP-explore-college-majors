2595079,5,B000FZETJS,"This show is awesome.  Michael, Michael, and David create some of the most original humor out there today.  Granted, some of the episodes are train wrecks, but that doesn't take away from their hilarity.  They are repeatedly watchable, because there will always be at least one joke that you forgot about, and the more you watch it, the funnier it gets.  Beware the tagline, this comedy is incredibly dumb, but if you treat it as such, you will not stop laughing.  Bottom line, buy this DVD.",1156636800,7,491,4.662790697674419
2595080,5,B000FZETJS,"Two years ago a friend convinced me to see this trio of comedians from MTV's The State perform at a comedy club in Boston.  Thank goodness she did, because it was perhaps the most hilarious evening I have ever spent watching something that I can hardly describe!  The best I can come up with is ""team stand up"" but that can only offer a glimpse into the brilliant, original work of Black, Showalter and Wain.  These guys have such great chemistry (that's what happens when you work with someone for decades) and freshness, I can't recommend them enough.  The show follows more of a narrative than their live act but the essence is the same: three grown men in suits that live out a live-action cartoon.  Time, space, all the traditional tenets of reality don't apply for these guys.  Just sit back, keep an open mind, and enjoy the lunacy of STELLA!

I couldn't wait for the DVD so I bought the show from iTunes so that I can watch it on my Video iPod.",1156464000,16,952,4.405714285714286

2595082,1,B000FZETJS,"I know this review will irritate and possibly offend large segments of the population. Such is life. This show is really awful. I would like to thank Comedy Central personally for cancelling the show, even though I believe they owe us an apology for even putting it on the air. Just because a network cancels something it isn't automatically an ""artist vs. the big, bad corporation"" battle. A show can be really awful, like this one. I remember the episode Novel, where the boys write a novel and a famous writer (played by Janeane Garofalo, who looks bored and irritated through the whole thing) steals it, and laughed maybe twice, and they were light chuckles at best. Then I tried to watch office party, laughed maybe once, and I just gave up.  Sometimes when you think the sketch is going to work, Wain, Black, and Showalter just end up doing something really dumb and stupid, and it ends up ruining the whole thing.  Maybe that's the point.  That seems to be the running joke of the series.  The ""brains"" behind Wet Hot American Summer created this mess.  It grows very tiresome very quickly.  So, definitely don't buy, and don't rent.",1155772800,7,1140,4.675
2595083,5,B000FZETJS,"I hate to just throw another five stars at Stella with the other reviewers, but it deserves nothing less! The comedy is brilliantly simple, which is hard to find in TV these days. The plots are simple and predictable enough that the ridiculousness of the jokes becomes the focus of each episode. It's amazing how few television shows take the absurdist route these days, but at the same time; I would have never guessed that three men in suits that act like toddlers could make me seriously laugh. The three main actors are hysterical in their unusual relationship with each other.

I watched much of the show's first season, and immediately decided that it was some kind of independant group that had come up with their own plots, and would stay away from the mainstream. However, they score huge credibility with great guest stars (Jeanine Garofalo, Paul Rudd I believe?), that play off of the absurdist comedy with some strange touch of realism. I can't recommend this show enough.",1155772800,27,984,4.822485207100592
2595084,5,B000FZETJS,"Stella is one of the most hillarious shows I have seen in a long time. With a comedy trio like Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, and David Wain how could you possibly lose?

2595085,5,B000FZETJS,"This had to be one of the funniest ORIGIONAL shows I have ever seen.  These guys have thier own unique style of comedy.  Nothing in any episode is predictable.  You can't tell what's going ot happen next and IT ROCKS!  It's one of those shows that you can watch the episodes over several times and the jokes don't lose thier magic on you.  One funny example of the comedy style I recall is Micheal Showalter cracks some eggs into a pan (shells and all; cooking breakfast in a hurry.  Camera pans away for a second while he says ""C'mon guys we're gonna be late"", camera pans back to the pan in his hand with 2 perfectly fully cooked sunny side up eggs.  That's just a small tinsy taste of what to expect though.  Buy the DVD, watch the SHOW.",1153785600,12,740,4.273381294964029
2595086,5,B000FZETJS,One of the best short lived comedy shows recently. If you have ever seen the Stella comedy group or movies starring Michael Showalter you will enjoy this. Even in just in one episode so much happens that the story is pointless and just the randomness become hillarious. It's also great to see adults that have never grown up and still really act like children.,1153526400,10,360,4.640625

I loved and recorded every episode on VHS and re-watched them on a road trip to Missouri. I'm glad to finally bought the season on DVD because nothing has come close to this kind of comedy. Michael & Michael Have Issues was a slightly similar show because of the cast, but the fact that David Wain was absent hindered the experience for me. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes comedy.",1407801600,,479,4.393258426966292

Hilarious, goofy, makes absolutely no sense, features random special characters (Ferris Bueller's best friend? Why, yes!), lots of puns, lots of goofy voices and fake deaths, and lots of meaningless makeout sessions with pointless characters.

I looked forward to coming home to watch this hilarious show. Now I own it on DVD, and I couldn't be more pleased. Er... I might be more pleased if it were in Blu-ray format and/or widescreen. But that has nothing to do with content! It's way funny; watch it.

Michael Ian Black is now my favorite comedian of all time. Mike Showalter and David Wain are okay (or, actually, I cannot stand either of them), but Michael Ian Black really steals the show. Also, read Michael Ian Black's new book: You're Not Doing It Right!",1330992000,2,663,4.346774193548387
2595178,5,B000FZETJS,"This is some of the funniest material I've seen on Comedy Central, and it's unlike the other stuff I like on the channel. The show left a lasting impression on me after 7 years, its goofy, unpredictable and constant gags freshly original to TV. Some aspects remind me of older Zucker brother productions like Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun or early Mel Brooks pictures like Young Frankenstein. The characters will often take actions you wish were scripted in other shows/movies, because it's more daring or unusual. At times they will even break the fourth wall, making viewers feel like participants in the antics.",1327104000,2,623,4.942857142857143

2595180,4,B000FZETJS,"I am a huge Michael Ian Black fan and really enjoyed this show. Unfortunately. I do understand why it's no longer on the air - the quality of the episodes decreased as the season progressed but it was still funny.
The biggest perk of this set, for me, is the features and commentary - a look into the minds of comic genius.",1311811200,,323,4.225806451612903
2595181,5,B000FZETJS,"Last year a friend lent me his Complete Series DVD set of the ""The Wire."" A few months later when I had finished watching it, I told him, ""You know, that's probably the best TV series I've ever seen. But it's not my favorite.""

""What?! What's your favorite then?""

""Stella,"" I replied.

And it's true. It would be difficult to quantify the level of enjoyment I've taken out of this series over the years. The episodes range in quality from gut busting laughs throughout(""Camping"" or ""Campaign"" for me) to simply gut busting laughs every few minutes (""Meeting Girls""). That is, of course, if this is your brand of comedy.

I've shared my DVD with numerous friends over the years. Once even, when I was still in college, 12 people on our floor gathered and we watched the entire series in one marathon sitting. I've almost universally heard the same response though: ""It's funny, but I can see why it got cancelled. It's just too weird."" And sadly I must recognize that this is probably accurate, for the majority of people probably don't appreciate absurdist humor sprinkled with obscure or academic allusions and vocabulary (I learned the word ""octoroon"" from Stella). I've largely just surrounded myself with people who do.

However, as I said, if that IS your kind of thing though, you'll be hard pressed to find a better, funnier show. I had never heard of Stella before this show came on the air, and the only one of the three cast members I recognized was Michael Ian Black, from his VH1 appearances. The summer it debuted though, my closest friends and I hung on every new episode, and quoted them continouusly. Phrases from the show have became a permanent part of our short hand. For instance, ""Trust me. Juuuust trust me."" or ""Do it, Do it Michael!"" The fact that it debuted at the same time as ""Mind of Mencia,"" which fan for four seasons to the mere ten episodes Stella was given never failed to rankle, and felt like the perfect juxtaposition to illustrate how broad pandering comedians can see ratings success, while shows that some view as cult works of genius often get swept under the rug.",1311379200,,2105,4.678378378378379
2595182,4,B000FZETJS,"This show is pretty quirky. Some parts of it can be a bit on the stranger side, but I still really enjoy it. Great price, Quick shipping!",1304726400,,137,4.111111111111111
2595183,3,B000FZETJS,"If you enjoy watching traditional t.v. sitcoms and dramas mocked this show is for you! The only shtick missing is the laugh track, which only make the show too cynical and acerbic, making it completely unwatchable, even for those ""in"" on the joke...

Although I initially liked the show, but after watching the first 6 episodes or so, I found it to be, well...trivial and insulting. I have better things to do with my time than to be mocked. After a while it felt as if the joke was on ME! And not the general state of t.v. show production and consumption. Besides, its so silly it eventually became trivial, like a college football game where a powerhouse is playing against ""small-time university"".",1283558400,,700,4.691056910569106
2595184,5,B000FZETJS,"This show earns the highest possible praise for a comedy series: it compares favorably with ""Red Dwarf.""  Of course it's conceivable (though just barely) that not everyone considers ""Red Dwarf"" the standard against which all other comedys are to be judged.  So if you don't count ""Red Dwarf,"" then ""Stella"" becomes the gold standard of comedy.  The fact that it only lasted one season of ten episodes pretty much proves that Comedy Central is to comedy as SyFy is to science fiction - and believe me, that's no compliment. The show isn't just funny (almost any show can be funny); it's surreal, whimsical and absolutely absurd all at the same time.  ""Stella"" is definitely not for those who want their comedy doggedly ""true to life"" so they can glean little snippets of everyday wisdom from the situations presented while they laugh at the all-too-obvious story line; in a word, it's not a show to guide you through life's perils.  Just the opposite: it creates an endless array of perils for the characters where there needed to be none at all. And, best of all, there's no way on earth you can guess how everything resolves.  By far your biggest challenge watching the series is deciding which episode is your favorite; it seems almost obscene to call any one episode better than the rest.  Even so, I'm going to stick my neck out and call ""Vegetables"" my favorite. It took all the magic of the show to an even higher plateau - which I wouldn't have thought possible. ""Stella"" is to American comedy as ""Red Dwarf"" is to British comedy.  And that's as good as it gets.",1280275200,,1569,4.659420289855072
2595185,5,B000FZETJS,"This set gets a 5 just for the fact that the commentary tracks are EXACTLY what every DVD set should aspire to. Every single episode has commentaries by each one of the principal actors involved in the show. Not 1/3 of the episodes being commentated by the make-up person or the guy who got coffee for camera operator #3.

Also, when they talk, you really get the sense that the actors (who also wrote the episodes) really cared for the series and are quite proud of their output despite the poor ratings.

When Stella was on Comedy Central, I remember being kinda ""meh"" about the whole thing. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't something I was terribly eager to watch either. When I heard of the DVD release, I thought I'd give it a try. After watching each episode with the commentaries on, it's now one of my all time favorites.",1259798400,2,828,4.440789473684211

2595239,5,B000FZETJS,"Since this show flew under the radar so greatly, I was expecting it to be a self-congratulatory skit show.  So many skits these days fall so flat, I just figured this would be full of 'groaners.'

Happy to report this is much more like 'Strangers with Candy.'  It's total nonsense, but very clever and each episode follows a storyline, rather than just being isolated skits.

Now for a very odd coincidence:  I'm actually only to the last episode of Disc One (but the fact I watched them all in a row in sheer delight tells me I will keep watching all through the night).  The show I really was going to compare this to is Chris Elliott's 'Get a Life.'  Then, as I'm starting to write my review, what do they do?  Become Paperboys!

Gotta be a nod to Chris--Stella certainly takes his skewed view of reality, but nothing is stolen from that show.  Simply 'carrying the torch.'

I freakin' love 'Get a Life,' and now I freakin' love 'Stella'.

But no wonder it got cancelled.  Still too 'far out' for the masses.

UPDATE:  Another 'Get a Life' nod:  Like I said, I was only through the first disc.  But another concept they borrow from Chris is when two of them get girlfriends--their relationships develop like 10 years (i.e. completely settling down in family life ruts, etc.) within ONE DAY.  Just like 'Girlfriend 2000.'  Again, all the jokes are their own, just fun to see such unquestionable tips of the hat to the legend (along with Garry Shandling) that created the whole Bizarro sitcom universe.",1187395200,2,1503,4.60377358490566

2595242,5,B000FZETJS,"Stella only lasted for a season on Comedy Central, but it's one of the funniest things they've ever done next to TV Funhouse (and I've watched every show on this channel all the way back in the Higgins Boys and Gruber Days).

The humor used in this show is unlike any I've ever seen before, and it is something you'll laugh at every time.  I can't really describe what they do or how it's funny, but I used to look forward to this show more than any comedy on the air, even Chapelle (Though it's apples and oranges there).  Stella manages to have a humor that is amazingly intelligent and witty while simultaneously being ludicrously stupid at the same time.  The one liners, the strange events, the bizarre plotlines, the hot neighbors, it's comic gold.

The cast is superb (all veterans of MTV's ""The State"" and the force behind ""Wet Hot American Summer"" as other reviews have mentioned).  If you like either of those shows or the folks in charge of Reno 911, you'll probably dig on some Stella.  I'll cut this review short because this show is something that has to be seen to be understood.",1179792000,12,1094,4.522842639593908
2595243,5,B000FZETJS,"Stella is a quirky, eccentric show that ran for one season on Comedy Central.  It combined the talents of David Wain, Michael Showalter, and the incomparable Michael Ian Black.  While it was technically a show about three guys who live together in an apartment, the comedy displayed in the show has never been done before in any setting.  It is difficult to find words to describe it, but I found it consistently laugh-out-loud funny, but in an intelligent fashion.

The three men are veterans of the comedy troupe ""The State"", and ""Stella"" is one of the progeny of that late, very lamented entity (along with other children ""Reno 911"", ""Viva Variety"", and ""Wet Hot American Summer"".  They bring a sophistication and intelligence to their craft that is all too rare in these days of Larry the Cable Guy.  Unfortunately, this show brought with it only cult interest, and as a result, was not renewed for another season.  The rumor has it that Comedy Central may make a Season Two should this DVD sell well (along the Family Guy model.)  As a result, I am very much hoping that this becomes a sensation; in this frequently depressing world, 'Stella' represents a product that is always innovative and frequently hilarious.  My fondest recommendations.",1179100800,5,1249,4.881516587677726
2595244,4,B000FZETJS,"Contained on this DVD set are some of the funniest things ever committed to television. Also on here are some pretty ""meh"" episodes. Listening to the commentary is actually kinda depressing, because they knew the show was cancelled before they started, so they're pretty cynical about the whole project. The extras are a 13 minute blooper reel, some deleted scenes, a ""lost episode"", and some other easter eggs... in all, nothing too funny.

Overall, definitely worth it despite any shortcomings because of those moments of brilliance that will have you laughing so hard you'll rewind and watch the same part ten times.",1174348800,3,619,5.068627450980392

2595246,5,B000FZETJS,"Absurdism + contrived situations x 3 = STELLA. If the Marx Brothers were alive in 2006, this is the type of show they would have made (except of course Chico would have to play the piano and Harpo would play the always present harp). I understand why this never caught on, but it's a shame it didn't. There was a lot of great comedy going on.",1173312000,6,342,4.196969696969697
2595257,5,B000FZETJS,"This is the type of comedy that the American audience needs! Unfortunately most either didn't care or were too used to the overused humor of the average sitcom to understand the pure brilliance of this comedy creation. The writing is indeed random, yet with a level of sophistication that rivals comedic gems such as The Office or Arrested Development(also too quick and subtle for the majority of today's laugh-track audience). From their over-the-top shtick to their subtle looks at the camera I laughed nearly to the point of tears. Only 10 episodes is not enough, and I hope they find a way to do more direct to DVD episodes on the side for their Stella fans. Buy this DVD and give Stella the chance they didn't get from Comedy Central. ""We don't have this money"" is no excuse! (sorry- that's been in my head all day making me laugh. If you're a Stella fan you understand why. I tried thinking of a quote that fits more with this review, but the way Showalter delivers that line is all I can currently think of:)",1171843200,9,1016,4.557377049180328

2595259,4,B000FZETJS,"It's a Michael, Michael, and David production, of course it is hilarious.

Season 1 has sevral random cameos (including Ed Norton, which his on screen time was about 10 seconds if that) that are pointless, but for some reason humorous.

Comedy Central claimed that season 2 would begin production based on the sales of S1, so PLEASE buy this, then tell all your friends to buy it as well.",1167782400,4,508,4.478260869565218
2595261,5,B000FZETJS,"It's a shame that this show won't continue on Comedy Central. I myself had originally written it off as a sophomoric example of ""random comedy"", but having given it a second chance it turns out to be a sublime example of intelligent surrealist humor. It runs the gamut through spoof, satire, irony, metahumor and all the while David, Michael and Michael knowingly wink at the camera.

It is a safe assertion to call this a modern day Monty Python. This is the funniest sketch comedy show (even though it isn't really sketch comedy) since Mr. Show With Bob And David.",1167782400,6,566,4.66
2595262,5,B000FZETJS,"I really was angry with Comedy Central for killing this show. It was by far their funniest and most innovative series. Given time, I think it could have gained a decent enough audience. However, make no mistake, this show was never geared towards the ""Carlos Mancia"" crowd, that is entertained by humor on a 7th grade intellect. This was a modern day Marx Brothers and the DVD is a jewel to own.",1166140800,7,395,4.5

2595264,2,B000FZETJS,I like to laugh. This really didn't do the job. I was hoping for something monty python style. It has its moments. I've seen the one guy in the Sierra Mist commercials and they are funnier. I've read where these guys have done some shorts and they are better. I would like to find them if possible.,1163030400,4,298,4.245614035087719
2595265,5,B000FZETJS,"This show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal. From the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i've been a huge fan of the series. I was so sad to hear it'd been cancelled but I wasn't surprised. It was one of the shows I loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air. Now that the DVDs are out I can relive these 13 fleeting moments in TV that are, to me, some of the funniest things I've ever seen. Apart from the hilarious, oddball performances from Michael Michael and David the series was packed with guest stars including Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, and a whole lot more. Really, anyone that is a fan of comedy ala Strangers with Candy will find this funny. It has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts.

Favorite episodes include:

Campaign

Paper Route

Coffee Shop

Novel

Meeting Girls

and

Vegetables

The extras on the DVD are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode, a lengthy and interesting ""History of Stella"" and much more. The commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other, giving some insight into the creation process, while remaining pretty well aware their show met with sub-par ratings. They take it all in stride and aren't too proud to poke fun at themselves. I think if this show had been on comedy central around the time Strangers with Candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons. It's a shame. Definitely worth getting, turning off your phone, and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season. ""And when I say plow that's a pun!""",1162684800,6,1662,4.531772575250836
2595266,1,B000FZETJS,"Oh, I get it alright.  The joke is, I thought the dvd would be funny, and it wasn't, and they got my thirty bucks!  Ho ho ho!

The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.

The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.

The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  ""How long can this go on without being funny,"" one asks oneself.  ""Surely it will be funny next episode!""

Nothin' doin'.

If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a ""funny skit"" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.

And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.  And then Comedy Central mercifully pulled the plug.",1161302400,10,1575,4.391003460207613
2595284,5,B000FZETJS,"Anyone who rates Stella down is missing the point: Stella is most definitely not for everyone.  But what is?  If we're going to even pretend to be objective about art, we have to ask how well it accomplishes its goals.  Stella's goal is to be the antithesis of traditional comedy, the height of absurdity, and the goal could not possibly be more successfully achieved.  5 stars for Stella, the show.

And this DVD release is perfectly done.  The picture and sound are first rate, and every special feature imaginable has been included.  Every single episode has a commentary track featuring all three members of Stella, and the history feature -- nearly an hour long -- is fascinating.  You get Stella's half-hour Comedy Central Presents stand up show, and blooper reels as well as deleted scenes and extended takes.  There's also reportedly an easter egg -- a Stella short that's never seen the light of day (i.e. on CollegeHumor)!  What more could anyone possibly ask from a DVD release?  5 stars once again.",1160265600,10,1010,4.813953488372093
2595285,5,B000FZETJS,"I've been following Stella from afar for a few years now. I live in England, I'm English and sometimes comedy doesn't translate well across the pond. But this is probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

I love comedy, and have a broad range of tastes, so maybe that's why I lapped up every ounce of hilarity to be squeezed from this glorious show. But you have to give it a chance, you can't watch a single episode in isolation and dismiss it.

Sure, there's more than a hint of self-indulgence and a great measure of self-gratification evident in the antics of our 3 heros and their alter-egos. But that's what makes it funny. Maybe some people don't like to invest their time in their entertainment any more, maybe they can't be bothered to get to know the perfomers and their scope and multi-talented endeavours. Well that's their loss, because that's why this nugget of comedy gold shines out like a beacon in a river of dross.

Put in some groundwork people, don't be lazy. Fast food is one thing, but that kind of instant gratification doesn't apply here. Stella needs to enjoyed like a gourmet dinner. And best of all, it's calorie free.",1159401600,11,1156,4.601941747572815

Nice extras on the DVD, especially the ""History of Stella"" documentary, which features great footage from the live shows.

People who hate this show are probably the same people who have made Larry the Cable Guy a ratings sensation on Comedy Central. Get 'er done! Gaaharf, gaaharf! It's a shame that there's no room for a smart show like Stella when Redneck Comedy Hour is on like five times a day.

2595289,2,B000FZETJS,"Stella establishes a unique reality where the conventions of adult life don't apply, but since the characters' naive enthusiasm is the impetus for all the comedy, the jokes all rest on the premise of ""what would someone act like if they had no understanding of the outside world"" and it quickly becomes tired. When the 3 main guys try to riff off each other it's like someone having a conversation with themself because they're all playing the same character, and when they bring in an outside straight-man character for them to collectively riff off, the lack of chemistry between the Stella boys and the other cast members inspires pity for all concerned.

It's like they took everything funny about their shorts and made them family friendly, thus making them unfunny.
