2589349,5,B000FUH3N2,"This is the story of a 60 year old crusty police detective in Scotland. The characters are very distinctive. Unfortunately, after 35 episodes the actor playing Taggart died and some episodes later the medical examiner was played by a less distinctive actor and the series was less entertaining with the remaining characters who were about 30 years old and not as eccentric.

The plots are extremely complex and convoluted. You have to have good people skills at remembering names and faces to figure things out. There is no summary at the end like Poirot gives. Engineering nerds like myself have to view several times to get the details.",1149811200,9,638,4.907407407407407
