5410364,5,B00AECK068,"This DVD, The Bema, is very thought provoking.  As far as I can tell it is Biblically sound about a topic that is not addressed greatly or maybe I should say specifically in God's Word. It is very moving and hopefully would make one search their own life as to how it is being lived.  The part I love is that even though this person was not living up to his potential in benefiting God's Kingdom and spreading the Word is that at the Bema it is all because of what Jesus did for us and not our ""works"".",1366588800,7,502,4.0606060606060606

8550391,5,B00AECK068,A must see for those on the fence about Christ and the end times.,1492300800,,65,3.7142857142857144
8550392,5,B00AECK068,"Very sobering, well done, moving and amazing even though it has theological errors. It makes a powerful impact.",1470528000,,111,5.222222222222222

8550394,4,B00AECK068,A very moving faith based film.  Well executed by Pete Briscos,1461196800,,62,4.636363636363637
8550395,5,B00AECK068,"We initially saw this film in church and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was purchased because we felt it was a great tool to show others the meaning of Bema.  Very little, if anything, is has been taught in church about what happens to Christians ""After"" the tribulation.  Too many think we're involved in the Great White Throne judgment.",1456876800,,334,4.724137931034483
8550396,5,B00AECK068,I watched this on YouTube.  Very thought-provoking dramatization of what the final judgement scene might look like.  Be careful to watch it with the Truth of what the Bible says in mind.  This is a fictional dramatization based on man's interpretation of scripture.  It serves as a great reminder to live for Christ.,1456099200,,316,4.90566037735849
8550397,5,B00AECK068,"This video is one of the most awe inspiring ones I have seen for a while.  The guy performing, (sorry, I can't recall his name right now) will keep you riveted to your seat although the video is lengthy.  It is a must see for anyone who wants to help themselves be prepared to meet their maker.  There is anpther video out called ""The Bema Seat"", which is a very similar story, but even though it is also good, it is not quite as well done as the one just called The Bema.",1445644800,,472,4.053763440860215
8550398,5,B00AECK068,Incredible video.  Everyone on earth should see it.,1439596800,,51,5.375
8550399,5,B00AECK068,"This was an amazing video that just gets you thinking...about how you can continue to work for the Lord and spread goodness, love; and how you are doing it now without even realizing it in some ways! The impact we all make on each other- this helped me to reflect on God's direction for me and what I need to be reminded of on a daily basis- beginning with the end in mind...this was life changing and impacted me greatly!",1369785600,8,422,4.2875
