Maybe the target audience was different in setting this one up.  The programs were good, just didn't flow well together.  If you had never taken a class this dvd would be valuable. Great for newbies.",1386028800,3,326,4.701754385964913
8564169,5,B00B8O4XX2,"OK, this DVD has given me a total surprise from content to production to level of instructions and the overall structure of demonstrating how to develop and conduct a full program. This has been the best self defense DVD I have bought. Of course, if you have previous training in KM or other similar type of training and are teaching, I know you will like this DVD. For sure this enhances 10 fold the drills, and other activities you may have implemented in your classes. You must get this DVD and see it for yourself. Now I will be looking for other productions available with these instructors.",1375660800,4,596,4.579439252336448
