4723680,1,B005LAIGOQ,"How many times is the same plot going to be used over and over again?

This is the same old story of a crazy woman spirit seeking revenge.  The main character in these types of stories does some research, finds a body, and gives it a proper burial, only to have the spirit remain at unrest.  Remind you of any other movies???

The movie was very slow and featured things moving in front of the camera followed by a loud noise.  No chances taken and very few interesting story elements make this movie run-of-the mill.  The settings were amazing, but don't seem to be fully utilized to make this a really thought-provoking film.

Overall, it's just the same thing we've seen before and offers nothing new or exciting.  What a let down.",1328400000,11,734,4.507575757575758
4723681,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Most people who go to see James Watkins' ""The Woman in Black"" will be perfectly satisfied with it. This lushly filmed ghost story, set in a remote English village in Edwardian times, does precisely what it sets out to do, which is to provide a steady stream of gasp-inducing thrills to its audience. Daniel Radcliffe is a few years too young to play Arthur Kipps--grieving widower, failing lawyer and father to a four-year-old son--who goes to sort out the tangled estate at creepy Eel Marsh House in a last-ditch attempt to save his career. But Radcliffe gives a solid and convincing performance nonetheless, as do Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer as a local couple who know more than they're saying about the mysterious title character, who appears in the cemetery next to the house at unexpected moments. The thrills, when they start coming, come pretty much nonstop, and Watkins & Co. deserve credit for remembering a cinematic truth too often forgotten these days: what you don't see is scarier than what you do.

As good as the new ""Woman in Black"" is, however, I still prefer the old TV version directed twenty-odd years ago by Herbert Wise. The basic story of the two versions is the same, but the details are somewhat different. In particular, the older version is bleaker, more hypnotic, and ultimately more tragic than the newer. The story in the older version builds more slowly, and the shocks are fewer, which many viewers undoubtedly wouldn't like. But the slower buildup allows the story's horror to creep more firmly into your bones, and the shocks--when they come--are the most powerful I can think of in any horror movie.

Unfortunately, the studio that made the new version has withdrawn the old one from distribution, so that it cannot be exhibited or sold anywhere. The old DVDs, when you can find them, fetch $100 or more apiece. Fans, however, are still willing to pay that. It may be that many viewers, seeing both versions, would still prefer the newer. All I hope is that soon the studio will re-release the old version and allow viewers to judge for themselves.",1328400000,2,2086,4.807799442896936
4723682,4,B005LAIGOQ,"As I type this, I've got the book sitting in my house. I'd purchased it before the movie came out, but held off because I knew how much of a literary purist I am when it comes to book to film adaptations. So here's a warning: I'm not sure how true this is to the book, but I know enough about the book to know that they did change things here and there. OK, now with that disclaimer, on with the review.

I loved this movie, but it helped that I saw it with a good audience. (Sometimes screaming teenagers can really help bring the tension up.) Radcliffe does a pretty good job in this movie. I was a little afraid that I'd spend much of the movie unable to distance him from the character of Harry Potter and also unable to see him as someone who had a kid, but he did pretty well in this and was able to carry the film. (Which he'd have to since a huge bulk of the movie is Radcliffe by himself.)

The real gem to the movie are the costumes and surroundings. I hate to say that I was more enchanted with the house and ""island"" that the Woman in Black haunted as well as with the excellent costumes. Someone put a lot of time and thought into these and it shows. Everyone looks fantastic here. If you're a costume or setting fan, you'll undoubtedly love this movie.

If you're a horror fan? Well, you'll probably enjoy the film for the gothic atmosphere and the jump scares (ie, the scenes where a ghost jumps out at someone). It's not the greatest gothic horror film ever made, but it's still good enough to where you'll probably walk out of the theater loving it and wanting to see it again at some point in time. The only thing that disappointed me is that I just got the feeling that there could have been a little more to it and that it relied a little overly much on the jump scares to push the tension along. Even the screaming teenagers eventually got a little quiet after a while. They were drawn into the movie but after a while they, just like everyone else in the theater, got somewhat used to the Woman In Black jumping out at people.

Overall though, this movie does what it set out to do: entertain. It's incredibly entertaining and I have no doubt that it'll end up getting various fan awards because of it. It's also just enough to push Radcliffe out of his Harry Potter box to where it'll make it more likely that people can see him as someone other than ""that Potter kid"". This is a great little film and I had a blast watching it. (I'll probably buy it when it comes out on DVD.) In my opinion, it's worth going to see in the theaters.",1328400000,3,2556,4.210204081632653
4723683,5,B005LAIGOQ,"""The Woman In Black"" is great! This is how the story goes: Arthur Kipps is a widowed lawyer whose grief has endangered his career. When he is sent to a remote village to sort out the affairs of a recently deceased eccentric, it soon becomes clear that everyone in the town is keeping a terrible secret. Although the locals try to hide the town's tragic history from Kipps, he soon learns that his client's house is haunted by the ghost of a woman who is looking for someone and something she had lost, and until she finds it, no one is safe from her vengeance.

The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Arthur) is great. The directing by James Watkins is great. The screenplay (based on Susan Hill's novel) by Jane Goldman is great.

The music by Marco Beltrami is great. The cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones is great. The film editing by Jon Harris is great. The casting by Karen Lindsay-Stewart is great. The production design by Kave Quinn is great. The art direction by Paul Ghirardani is great. The set decoration by Niamh Coulter is great. The costume design by Keith Madden is great. The make-up and visual effects are great.

This is a great slow-build of a scary movie that will keep you thinking and on the edge of your seat with your heart racing. Daniel Radcliffe is great as Arthur Kipps and proves that he does have a career outside Harry Potter. This is one of the best horror movies in a while and another interesting return to form for Hammer Films.",1328400000,4,1465,4.520754716981132
4723684,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Daniel Radcliffe is on screen most of the time in this movie.  He is alone much of the time, too.  The haunted house in question is the quintessentially spooky house that is inaccessable parts of the day or night due to the tide washing over a swamp.  The eerie atmosphere is well kept and Daniel's really good in the film.  As one review said above, how many ways can this kind of scary movie tell the same story?  For those who expect decapitations and lots of gratuitous blood, I'm sorry, but this movie isn't that kind of movie.  Some of the thrill moments are standard, but if, like the other reviewer above, the only thing you're doing is counting the number of them, then you obviously should not be reviewing this movie. The brief glimpses of shadows moving or figures moving past a mirror get to you almost at once. NOthing is scarier than shadows that move.

Being indelicate, Daniel Radcliffe's not a tall person, and in this movie that doesn't matter at all.  Still he didn't have to have a love scene with a taller woman or have to out-yell someone who is a foot taller.  It was a wise choice, because now we can just concentrate on the good job he does.  (There are long moments when there is no dialogue, and they don't drag - not for me, anyway.)

Is it perfect? No. But it certainly is preferable to me over those slasher movies (in which I lost interest years ago.)  It isn't quite as surprising as ""Sixth Sense"", but the ending was not expected.  My real complaint, not addressed by any others, is that the dialogue in some places is slightly muffled.  I have some hearing problems, but this wasn't in that category.  The dialogue was simply not clear in places, notably Daniel Radcliffe's first conversations with his boss and with the man who eventually helps him (whose son has also died.)  Dan was fine, but the others were muffled, relying on the British mumble to get through.

I'm glad I went, and my reservations are minor.  There were moments when I had reall chills from fright.",1328313600,35,2007,4.512465373961219
4723685,2,B005LAIGOQ,"At the tail end of the 19th century, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) still feels like the wound is still fresh when it comes to his wife who died four years ago after giving birth to their son. Arthur is drowning in a depressive state that even his son notices. As a lawyer, Arthur is forced to travel to a secluded town to take care of the work of the now deceased Alice Drablow as a last ditch effort to save his job. Arthur is expecting to be buried in paperwork until the weekend, but the odd occurrences that transpire are a bit out of left field. Everyone in town practically begs for Arthur to return to London immediately as children continue to die gruesome deaths left and right. Ignoring their pleas, Arthur decides to confront the problem head on and stay at the Drablow's menacing house where his constant run-ins with the supernatural eventually take its toll on him.

The Woman in Black is a horror film that I wanted to be good. It's Daniel Radcliffe's first movie outside of the Harry Potter franchise and he's been pretty enthusiastic about it in interviews, but every bit of promotional material seemed to point at the movie being your everyday, generic, run of the mill, ""scary"" movie. The Woman in Black does provoke your interest at first. The strange opening is a little hokey, but kind of intrigues you at the same time. The atmosphere the movie tries to setup is its strongest asset though. The heavy use of fog and old fashioned feel of the town does make the town feel like it existed in the late 1800s and the ominous score does its best to try and bring you to the edge of your seat. The Drablow house is the key to that atmosphere as it's absolutely gorgeous in this hideously grotesque kind of way. Everything is so dusty and creepy while the Victorian design only adds to that uneasy feeling the movie tries to stir up in the pit of your stomach.

In the meantime though, everything else in the movie is working against it. It's extremely uneventful. Daniel Radcliffe reads papers, walks through a house, holds a candle, and gets a little dirty. That's the entire movie in one sentence. The Woman in Black also resorts to relying on nothing more than jump scares to try and scare its audience. There are four in the first twenty minutes; two from the same sequence and there are at least ten throughout the entire movie. Jump scares can be fantastic in small portions, but come off as incredibly weak when you can see them coming a mile away and are strung together haphazardly for a cheap effect. There isn't much dialogue while Arthur is in the Drablow house either, which is practically the entire movie. This was probably done to try and make the audience more absorbed with what was taking place on screen, but seems like a bit of a copout overall. Radcliffe has proven that he is an extremely talented actor, but he's pretty bland here. He mostly wanders around in a daze with a frazzled look on his face the entire time. His hosting gig on Saturday Night Live was more impressive in comparison.

The Woman in Black will still be a very successful film as nearly everyone who was or still is a Harry Potter fan will be lining up around every street corner just to be able to see this movie, but the fact of the matter is that it just isn't a great movie. Its representation of the late 19th century is pretty good, but the writing, the ""scares,"" and (most of all) the entire conclusion are all just extremely disappointing. The Woman in Black is a watered down version of last year's Insidious that will more than likely gain a lot of praise it doesn't deserve.",1328227200,10,3599,4.508422664624809
4723796,3,B005LAIGOQ,"Lots of opportunities for jumps, but all pretty standard cheap scare stuff. Honestly, for the first hour or so I began to wonder if anything was actually going to happen outside of the standard make you jump devices. Radcliffe was pretty good I thought but a couple other things really bothered me. They never recovered the body of the kid? Lazy slackers. Come on, I think I could have got a group of locals together and accomplished that. Then there's the ending. In my opinion, this ending really ranks among suckie endings as one of the suckiest. Even after the horrible ending, I could have ended it better. After the credits even. In fact, I wrongly predicted that the filmmakers would correct that stupid ending before the dvd ended. All in all, I kind of enjoyed the movie as not a waste of time, but that putrid ending was an unforgivable way to end a decent movie.",1524873600,,873,4.56687898089172

4723800,5,B005LAIGOQ,"I wasn't expecting much from this. Everything I had heard was this is a cookie cutter horror film. In a lot of ways it is, but that doesn't really cover everything.

The rough sketch is a ghost wants revenge for a hurt inflicted in life. Man shows up, stirrs up the evil, bad things happen.

However when you look past that at the actual details of the story, the character motivations of both the living and the dead, the film has much more nuance.

I'll admit I was a bit thrown, not having expected it to take place in the 1800s. Once I got used to that however the story flowed nicely.

Daniel Radcliffe has grown up into a fairly talented actor. After this and Horns I look forward to seeing what else he does. That said I do feel they made one questionable bit of direction. There is a portion of the film near the beginning where the main character waits for a train and then rides a train. While perfectly suited for the film... Well, it certainly reminded me that the actor used to play Harry Potter. That said Daniel Radcliffe never broke character and certainly never felt like his old character. In other words I feel he did a good job.",1523836800,3,1148,4.350467289719626

4723915,4,B005LAIGOQ,Daniel Radcliffe  clearly carries this otherwise dull horror  movie through his skillful acting I enjoyed the suspense he conveyed to me as a viewer  as he walked  through this flick's' whimpering plot twists. The house on the fog shrouded moors was clearly spooky and I was glad to see the actor who played the Wildling king on Game of Thrones lending some much needed support.

Well, I guess I run a bit deeper than that and have a good imagination so the slightly less than perfect effects didn't bother me at all.  I simply enjoyed the creepy factor.

A sad story that has a sad ending but I'll say no more to avoid spoilers. Radcliffe and Hinds were very good. It's basically a ghost story/horror story without gory bits.

4723973,2,B005LAIGOQ,"I love good ghost stories.  By ""ghost"" stories, I mean ones where there's supernatural phenomenon that is attributed to a non-corporal being that may or may not threaten humans.  I DO NOT mean slasher snuff stories/films that just use a spirit as an excuse for killing people in gruesome ways.  Unfortunately, The Woman In Black belongs to the latter category.  The plot of a deranged late 1800's mother indiscriminately offing innocent children is unimaginative at best; disgusting at worst.  The fact that there are plot holes, inconsistencies and tonnes of tired cliche's doesn't help. I found myself frequently checking how far I was in the movie an being tempted to just skip ahead.  The special effects are cheese and the dialogue uninspiring or even remote period accurate.  The climax is not only expected but welcome if only because I wanted the movie to be over.  Just because it ends doesn't mean the ending is in any way satisfying.  I just couldn't suspend disbelief which made this unfrightening and boring. Admittedly it was occasionally funny even though it wasn't trying to be.  Honestly the plot isn't really even good enough to warrant a half hour TV episode much less a feature length movie.

The only reason it gets 2 stars is that Daniel Radcliffe gives a stellar performance.  I'm one of those rare people that is not a real fan of the Harry Potter movies, but still enjoys all Mr. Radcliffe's character portrails.  True to his talent, he almost saves this train wreck.  ...Almost.",1515369600,,1504,4.893280632411067

4723975,1,B005LAIGOQ,"I don't know where the positive reviews are coming from but this movie was incredibly stale. I do not know why Radcliffe chose to star in it. If i were him I wouldve rejected the role upon reading 10 minutes into the script. It is EXTREMELY formulaic which here means that it introduced very little original elements and instead resorts to the cookie cutter horror film recipe which goes something like, protag arrives at haunted house, realizes its haunted after strange events, goes up against apparitions, attempts to solve problem to purge said apparitions.

Heres out it plays out: first 40 min of movie we are given vague introductions and an unclear plot. Daniel radcliffe plays hide and seek with apparitions when he arrives at the apparently haunted house (shocking). A series of events unfolds as children start to die as they did and have done after the events regarding a deceased mentally ill woman comitted suicidemany decades ago after her son is carelessly left to die in an accident from his adoptee parents. After Radcliffe is convinced he works with a friend by trying to reunite the vengeful lady in black apparition by reuniting her with her dead son... (Poor choice here because he basically just trials and errors on this one with no basis on how this will actually satisfy the lady in black). The apparition seemingly disappears. But then there is a twist: lady in black doesnt care. She comes back this time killing Radcliffes son and him in the process.

Radcliffe and son are reunited with his long deceased wife and they walk off into the mist. So not only does the story leave an unresolved plot but it also errors in making one of the worst sins in horror cinematography imo with that stupid ending wherein the audience is supposed to feel happy for Radcliffe because he and his son are now dead and reunited with the mother but is supposed to forget that there evil lady in black is still lurking in the shadows of the haunted eel marshes house. Just distasteful storytelling that didn't know how to end it so why not kill off the protag in the most cliched twist ever.

When I first saw this movie in theatres, I counted the number of jumpscares, which was 17 (maybe off by one or two in either direction). That means there's at least one jumpscare for every 5 minutes of movie.

The story is also incredibly silly, the ghost effects laughable and modern cliches, feeling almost like one of those awful Insidious movies, and the ""scares"" are far too elaborate to the point where they have far surpassed my suspension of disbelief.

If you can find a copy, watch the original 1989 version. It's not perfect (what movie is) and there are one or two cheesy moments, but it's subtle, simple, and terrifying.

4724674,3,B005LAIGOQ,"The use of CGI fog is almost unforgivable, but on the whole this was a pretty good film.  Where it really fails is in the absence of religion, with only a few minor exceptions (including one character FINALLY making the Sign of the Cross).  English villages c. 1900 were already religious in the real world, and the events in the movie's background would tend to make the villagers zealously religious.  Speaking of zeal, they would have intervened much more decisively (that is, violently) in preventing an outsider from stirring up the trouble we see; they would probably have tried to burn down the haunted house at some point, probably decades in the past.  There seems to be a rule, though, that characters in horror movies do not behave like real people would.

On the other hand, the element of mystery is well played, and both the motivation of the ghost and the ghost's behavior at the end of the film follow a kind of traditional logic -- she may not have been reasonable, which is probably too much to ask of a vengeful ghost, but she was at least consistent.",1501891200,,1070,4.610526315789474

4724679,4,B005LAIGOQ,"As a horror fan I come into any ghost story with an air of skepticism ready to be disappointed. Thankfully this movie delivers. I thought the casting was excellent, the drama suspenseful and not overly predictable. The scenery and the sets were outstanding in so much that just being in those places and rooms would be spooky enough to give one shivers down the spine. The story lends itself to some typical horror tropes but not in such a way as to cheapen the whole experience that much. Given today's heavy use of cgi its to be expected in movies such as these but in this case often I felt it was understated and it was more the content of the scene that made it scary rather than a frightening monster so to speak. I don't want to give anything away but the swamp scenes were deliciously horrific and scary good fun.

4724806,2,B005LAIGOQ,"The woman in Black is a very interesting story idea and has all the right pieces but to all the wrong puzzle. The short synopsis is this, a down-on-his-luck man goes to the country side to complete one final job for his work, at which point an evil spirit starts to haunt him and the town. Should be an easy horror movie to make, right? It has an easily eerie pretense and a lovable main character; and yet the movie is flawed with long pauses, terrible plot explanations, and not to mention a long list of unanswered questions.

I gave the movie two stars because I liked the house. Stop here if you don't want anything spoiled.

So let's start on our down-on-his-luck here, Daniel Radcliff. Besides giving a performance that was exactly what we expected from Daniel Radcliff, the director goes into WAY too much backstory. In more minutes than were needed, we learn his wife died during child birth and he sort-deeply loves his son (sort). Not to mention apparently he is really sh*tty at his job and so this is his last chance to get it right, so you know he's going to try harder. Oh, and he has to take a train where they again show way way way too many flashbacks of a wife who holds way way way too little importance to the rest of the film (we'll get to that later).

The town is sort of creepy, what with little children staring out the window at the newcomer, but what I thought was really haunting was the lack of talk between Daniel Radcliff and his driver. I mean really, who goes to a countryside village and sits in the passenger seat silently? In the movie sense, they are trying to make a creepy town but I thought it was an excellent time to have Daniel learning the backstory of the town while seeing creepy children looking out of windows.

The house and items that filled it, the location, and the general flow to the house was all well done with a haunting atmosphere. Like I said, I liked the house and that's why I gave the film two stars. However, once in the house (when ghostly stuff should be happening), the director chose to force the viewer to see hauntings instead of letting them naturally progress or evolve. This was a major flaw since most of the movie is about passive eeriness. In fact, the haunting screech noise they play to try and jump scare you was probably the least scary part and the most annoying thing. Instead of capitalizing on new horror techniques (which don't work), the direct should have focused on atmospheric haunting and psychological terrors.

Yet none of this even begins to scratch the surface of why this film fails. The ghost, as scary as she is, has a purpose that doesn't align with her backstory. She's killing children of the town, but why? The town did nothing to her, it was her dead family. And her dead family is dead, so at most she could haunt the property, but why kill the children? They never answer this question nor do they answer why she will never be happy even after her son is returned to her. Once you come to this realization, the whole film falls apart. For one, why is Daniel Radcliff bringing his only child to the countryside where he's working when most people would have left the son at home with the faithful nanny? What did killing both of them really answer with the ending? And more importantly, what was the point of the movie if they managed to do nothing with the ghost's soul? Overall it was a creepy idea but someone should have worked on the plot to fix all these questions.

So here's my idea, first of all have something where its the town that ends up killing her child by accident. Now she has a reason for a vendetta. Second, if you are going to spend so much time focusing on Daniel Radcliff's wife, why not turn her into a good ghost? Why does she only have to be dead if you are having an evil spirit. Maybe instead of the ending they had, they show his dead wife protecting his son. Overall, it's a really flawed movie and not very scary.",1499126400,,3947,4.4

I'm not sure how else to describe it.
Overall, if you're looking for a good quality horror film to watch when you don't usually, this one certainly does the trick! The cinematography was executed well, and the colors, while conforming to the traditional, bleak scheme, were by no means dull. The plot kept you waiting for the next reveal, but it had loose ends as well. Probably so they could make a sequel.
If it takes a lot to scare you, this film may not do the trick, but personally, I was pretty tense throughout. I was constantly trying to distract myself with other things so that I wouldn't jump at the next cut. The scares all died down in the last 20 to 30 minutes to give the plot its time, so that part wasn't as hard to watch. As for the ending itself, not a big shock. Fitting to the rest of the story.

Boring horror that's paint-by-the-numbers typical ghost film, with noting really scary. The acting is sub par at best, and the special effects are just cheap ghost children in makeup. The ending and it's idiotic plot hole just basically makes Arthur's(Daniel Radcliffe) attempt to reunite son and mother to pass on completed dumb and pointless. Instead of being at peace with finally having her son's body returned to her to move on in the afterlife she decides to still get revenge on him and his kid?!?! Okay...even if they were going for a Grudge like thing with her spirit and curse, it's dumb! Why would her spirit get him and his boy killed, then let them reunite and leave with his wife who died during his kids birth?? It's like the spirit said, ""I'll do him a solid, he misses his wife so much I'll kill them both so they can live together in eternal peace.....I'm so nice.""

She keeps the souls of all the other kids she's forced to commit suicide, but lets them stay together and leave? That breaks the spirits MO, and it is a bad way of saying ""Thanks!"" See how dumb that is.....that's basically the train of thought for this plot. Why not just let them live a normal life with a close train scare, or the ghost of Arthur's wife saves them. Something other then that nonsense ending would've been much better.

4726531,1,B005LAIGOQ,"It's the old ""I'd give it zero stars, if I could."" All the recommendations proved false: NOT visually striking, NO suspense, and the film committed the unforgivable sin: absolutely ZERO understanding of the late 19th century. Period films, even dumb horror films, are not simply authentic costumes and sets; dialogue has to be written with an understanding of how people spoke, and especially that human behavior may not change, but social mores and customs do. When I saw that one character, was referred to on paper as ""Ms."" I knew it was time to write this one off. One clue was that dialogue was largely absent; apparently because the story was so weak, there was no way to write a credible narrative. I don't know how old the authors of the screenplay were, but I'm guessing under 25. I would recommend a 50 year old Hammer horror film any day of the week, over this!",1481155200,4,872,4.632258064516129

4726629,1,B005LAIGOQ,"I enjoy fantasy but I think this is one of the worse films I have seen in ages. The plot is, for the most part, boring and, unless you just want to look at Daniel Radcliffe, the acting is pretty bad, too. As Radcliffe wanders, alone, in this large, haunted house, the dog that accompanies him only, occasionally seems upset by some unseen forces. It growls on cue once in a while and seems content to lie around while Daniel encounters noises and disturbances in other parts of the house. If the dog doesn't sense more than the human, what good is he? There are too many other things that are not logical to make this film worthwhile, whether it is his having no food or water at this house, diving into black muck to retrieve ""something,"" then having more clothes than his tiny suitcase could carry.

I was not exactly happy with the conclusion or take-away from the film which seems a bit excessively bleak, I can stand a depressing story but I think there should at least be the chance of a good outcome or why don't we all just jump off a bridge together.
  It seemed believable that such a collection of soul-wounded characters all had their individual motivations for helping or hurting which I think is the only reason to watch such a depressing movie.",1478563200,,616,4.394736842105263

4727173,1,B005LAIGOQ,"Awful. The story line had huge holes.  If children were being killed off, why would villagers lock up a children still alive as if that would protect them rather than leaving the village?  How could the ghost's dead child's body show little sign of decay when it's mother's remains were nothing but bones?  Why after spending the last almost half of the film reuniting the ghost with her dead child's remains and thereby putting the ghost at peace and everyone else at rest that the curse had been lifted, does the ghost suddenly take violent retribution against the main character and his child?  The movie had plenty of the typical scary cut-aways, but with the incongruities, and particularly an ending that leaves the viewer wondering ""what the . . .?"", I can't recommend this to anyone.",1478390400,2,791,4.794117647058823

4727369,2,B005LAIGOQ,"I'm convinced this movie was created simply to make Daniel Radcliffe suffer even more on screen than he already has. Because he is just so good at it.

The setting is gorgeous.
The characters are interesting.
The concept is compelling.
But the way it all played out was just so cringingly bad that at the end I was left with such a deep feeling of dissatisfaction I had to immediately watch something else to wash away the taste.  There's so many strange plot holes and elements that seem to serve no purpose. While the ghost has in interesting motivation, we never have any flashbacks of her when she was alive, which takes away a major emotional aspect. At the same time, we never see any tender moments of the main character's wife when she was alive either. The movie relies almost completely on jump scares, screaming, and sudden loud music.
Perhaps it is just because I am too young to want to contemplate my own mortality just yet, or the fact that I have no wife I am eager to reunite with in the afterlife, but I cannot not say I enjoyed my decision to watch it. All the elements to make it a haunting and horrifying story of strong love and strong loss were there but it was missing something that might have made it the kind of story that stays with you and tugs at your mind long after you've seen it.

It was a quick scare that I was glad to stop thinking of as soon as possible.",1478044800,,1392,4.325670498084291

I say less is more because this movie caters to those of us that enjoy all things psychological.  Love the setting, the time period, the location and the house.

4727836,4,B005LAIGOQ,Both my teen daughter and I thought this was well done -- it's something when you find yourself watching the background instead of main characters for look for sightings or strange occurrences.  Found the ghost's ending unfulfilling but overall we enjoyed it and found it to be creepy and different.,1476144000,,299,4.98

4727928,2,B005LAIGOQ,"Lets get one thing straight from the start: Woman in Black is only as well reviewed as it is because of all the Daniel Radcliffe fangirls (and boys) who, still fawning over his performance as Harry, would have liked this film even if hed adorned blackface and acted like a chimp. There is nothing that could have sunk this movie at the box office. NOTHING. The only confusing bit about Woman in Black is that people haven't since come to their senses about how painfully uninspired it is now that the Harry Potter furor has died down (as much as it ever dies down, anyway).

Make no mistake, folks. Woman in Black is as cookie cutter as horror gets. (Minor spoilers follow)

Without spending too much time recapping the plot, the gist of the movie is this: Danny-boy is sent to handle some lawyerly papers (which he never gets around to) to do with a deceased womans estate; once in town, everyone tries to get rid of him without telling him why, and when he goes to the estate to handle that business he never handles, he encountersget thisstrange things, every single one of which youve seen in multiple other horror movies. Its not even worth recapping what they aretheyre the same worn out devices and jump-scares you get with seemingly every modern horror flick, and theres no fresh spin on any of it, either.

To the films credit, I did make it to about the 1-hour mark before I realized it did not have any redeeming value and was unlikely to develop any, a realization that the last third of the film confirmed. So at least I can compliment the filmmakers for camouflaging how boring the movie is halfway decently. But if thats the best I can say for it

Look, folks: The only real item of interest in Woman in Black is determining at what point youll get bored when you sit down to watch it. Save your time and money.",1475712000,2,1826,4.474474474474475

I am a person who gets tired of the cliche dumb half naked girls running around screaming, lost in the woods with a video camera, or the dumb city kids in the country scenario this is far different than most typical horror films.

4728034,2,B005LAIGOQ,"It was a very different take on the ghost story, they didn't hid her from the audience we got to see her really quickly and what she was doing to the town.  I would say that they rushed the development of the ghost and didn't have enough atmosphere and lacked scares.  the biggest win for the movie was when you learned about who the woman in black actually was.  I wasn't sold on Daniel's character and his motivations, everyone told him it was taken care of yet he wouldn't listen to them.

If your definition of a good horror movie includes Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Saw you will be disappointed. This is purely a ghost story with no blood that I recall, sure some kids die and you see a couple corpses, but in all the element of horror is built through the environment, ominous music and mists with a decrepit, over grown house.",1472342400,2,479,4.5813953488372094

4728524,3,B005LAIGOQ,"The Woman in Black, is the best known version of a story which began as a novel and was made into a 1989 TV movie and a play, and has been followed by a sequel film.  Starring Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame, and featuring Ciarn Hinds (Mance Rayder in Game of Thrones) and Roger (DI Fred Thursday in Endeavour,) The Woman in Black is an old fashioned Gothic horror story, set in a creepy house in a remote weird village, where the disconsolate ghost of a woman who had lost her child takes vengeance by killing the children of the village.  Radcliffe plays a young lawyer sent to sort out the affairs of the house's deceased owner.  The film is a mixed bag:  the early 20th century atmosphere is very vividly realized, and the film gets its effect from well done continual menace rather than gory special effects.  It's been criticized for going through every horror film cliche in the books -- mysteriously hostile village yokels, a haunted mansion, furniture moving with no one in it, etc. -- though these standard characteristics are very well done.  My main dissatisfaction personally is that the film sets us up for a basically happy ending which it then fails to deliver. All in all, I'd give this three and a half stars if I could.  You'll want to watch it if you are a real fan of ghost stories.  The  CBS Films Blu-Ray disc is of excellent quality.  Advisory: rated PG 13, the main caution is that some people (not everyone) say they find it genuinely scary.",1471824000,,1473,4.524528301886792

There were definitely moments with a heavy sense of dread and a few parts had me on the edge of my seat, waiting for the ""woman in black"" to appear.

4728937,3,B005LAIGOQ,"I liked the movie. It was eerie and had some nice jump scares, but if I was going to compare it to the book I'd say it missed the original feel and tone of the town and of its characters. In the movie the town folk are all aggressive and intolerant of Mr. Kipps arrival and continued presence. In the book they were wary of him cause they didn't want to talk about the house or it's ghostly occupants. They were a town of scared people. They tried to encourage Mr. Kipps not to go to the house and did everything they could to be hospitable. Also the plot of the movie is different than the book. I understand the reason because the book is a slower paced Gothic tale that may not interest viewers.

With that being said, if you enjoyed the movie you will like the book more. If you enjoyed the book like I did, this is more of a re-telling of the novel not an adaptation of the book and it has really nice scares.",1469664000,,914,4.106145251396648

There isn't necessarily anything unique about this film.  It is your basic haunting story, but done ok.
Not enough to make me want to see the sequel however. And to be honest, we watched primarily for Daniel.

Daniel Radcliffe is amazing - he's really coming into his own as an actor and moving ""us"" away from seeing him as Harry Potter. Lots of dark atmosphere overall, and a real sense of dread throughout the movie. And lots of spooky things going on in the deserted mansion. Production values are A++++. I really like ghost stories in this vein and this one satisfies. My only complaint is the ending. Almost like they needed to wrap things up and came up with a hurried ending. And they added a subplot that was not in the book, and really didn't need to happen in the movie. It only ends up being confusing. But overall, a good movie.",1465084800,,688,4.425196850393701

4731703,4,B005LAIGOQ,"This is a pretty good movie. You have Harry Potter as an adult with a young son. He moves to some crazy scary mansion, and he starts seeing ghosts. I liked Ed Gibbs review of the movie. He said: In true ghoulish fashion, the emphasis here favours chills over gore, with a tense, imaginative treatment from British director James Watkins (of Eden Lake fame), adapted by acclaimed screenwriter Jane Goldman (aka Mrs Jonathan Ross), who's better known for co-writing the likes of Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and The Debt. Horror music specialist Marco Beltrami (a frequent collaborator of Wes Craven's) completes the package, with a shiversome soundtrack that resonates. Dark, damp and drenched in mud and fog, Kipps's destination is the quintessential Hammer house of horror locale. You almost expect Christopher Lee's Dracula  a favorite of the Hammer stable  to appear at any moment, to offer his seal of approval. (The film begins with three young girls fatally distracted from their toys in a dank, creepy attic.)",1461196800,,1016,5.077844311377246

4731833,5,B005LAIGOQ,"The Edwardian ghost story, ""The Woman in Black,"" directed by James Watkins, is an extraordinary film.  Daniel Radcliffe, no doubt fortified by his stage work, has become one of the finest actors of his generation.  Diminutive, melancholic, quietly intense, he is superb.

One hopes some enterprising director mounts a film of Goethe's ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" for him.  And would not Mr Radcliffe make an ideal Hamlet?  Or as the star of a biographical film of Paul Morphy...

Enveloped in a romantic sadness, with beautiful cinematography, this is the finest Gothic-horror film I have seen in quite some time, with an extraordinary apotheosis, and a fine score from Marco Beltrami.  It reinforces the astonishing potential of the cinema, so seldom realized.",1460505600,,764,5.213114754098361

4732589,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Ahhh...Hammer Films. How we have missed you.
From the 50's to the 70's,  Hammer dominated the horror scene, mostly by using characters that the world was already familier with, made famous by Universal. In the early 80's, the studio folded, due to the over saturation of horror movies being released. In 2007, the studio was purchased, and in 2012, this gem arrived.
From the opening scene, this movie drips with a sinister and ghastly aura. Three young girls, suddenly and without apparent reason, synchronize dive their way out of a attic window. Any movie that starts with multiple child deaths, is setting the standard very high.
Authur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) hasn't been doing so well since his wife died. His career at a law firm is in danger, and he is sent on a two day assignment to
Eel Marsh house, to sort through the affairs of a recently deceased woman, to search for her final will. If the job goes well, he retains his job. If he fails, he adds unemployment to his list of miseries.
The story is a familier one, with Authur being a stranger in a strange land, rejected by the locals, with the exception of Sam Daily (Ciaran Hinds, who if you don't know as Julius Caesar in Rome, you are living your life wrong). However, despite the lack of originality, this movie has such a bleak atmosphere of darkness, that it easily sits high on the list of creepy ghost stories.
Scare Factor 10/10 From the opening scene, to the final credits, this movie is genuinely scary, even when nothing in particular is happening. Yes, there are jump scares, but they never feel forced, and they never take away from the sense of foreboding.
Gore 2/10 There is very little blood in this movie, but it is in no way missed. To have made it visceral would have cheapened it, and taken away from the well crafted horror that it prevails in.
Acting 10/10 Radcliffe has become a master of the art, and he plays his character to perfection, so that you feel his grief, but he never crosses the line to whiny or annoying. Also Ciaran Hinds is an acting God.
Recommended 10/10 While there have been many ghost stories that have succeeded in being scary by showing us nothing, there have been many more that have failed by giving us too much. This film perfectly balances the two, and keeps the tension so high that even the slightest shift of shadow can make a heart rate quicken. The score is amazing, going from subtle to crashing in a second, and perfectly highlighting every second. Every tiny tinkle of sound is meticulously placed.
Aside from being scary as hell, it also has one of my favorite endings in all of movie history, bringing to a close a brilliant ghost story that deserves to be in every horror fans collection.",1456876800,,2717,4.590534979423868

I will say it was sad to think of the mud scene, I can hear that actor after he read the script, ""you want me to do WHAT?"" lol They made a 2nd movie of this ...drivel.

The ending is as predictable as everything else in the story, and is kind of anecdotal (if you know the joke about ""it was a different elephant).
It was moderately entertaining with a basic set of jump scares. They most definitely could have done so much more with this plot. Lots of possibilities that were right at hand but not explored.

4733542,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Good film version of the story by Susan Hill. Daniel Radcliffe (who has grown into one of the best actors of his generation) assumes the role of the young Solicitor Arthur Kidd (first played in 1989 by Adrian Rawlins...who played Harry Potter's dad, James Potter in the well known series based on the books by J. K. Rowling). The rest of the cast is also quite good.
In my opinion. though, it is the 1989 version that is the superior film even though IT was made for television. Perhaps because it was made for British Television which, when it is good, is awesome.
And that version, directed by the legendary Herbert Wise, was awesome indeed. It would have five stars but this one gets a solid four.

Plenty of suspense and unease, and an interesting twist at the end, which did have me weeping and was totally unexpected. I'd say if you appreciate subtle horror, you will enjoy this slow paced, atmospheric period tale. The cast is stellar, as well.

I love dogs and especially in this movie because none of dogs became casualties like other movies manage to stoop to. This movie was so visually gorgeous.

4734667,2,B005LAIGOQ,"As a dark suspense/pseudo horror it was pretty good. If you don't know the plot, go read it in other comments, this review is not about how the movie goes... only the ending really.

SPOILERS TO SOME DEGREE - STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!!!

Hopefully this is far enough down for some spoilers. No details... just my complaint with this film. Up til the end, I was enjoying the minor jump scares and intense build up of the danger and fear of what the woman in black wanted. Then they seemed to find the answer and dealt with it. All wrapped up in a nice neat package at the end, cue the happy family reunion and roll credits.

But that isn't how it ended. They didn't actually figure out what the Woman in Blacks motivation really was. They gave her what they thought she wanted and she still did her thing. This is where I stopped liking this film. I'm OK with leaving an open ending and making you want to see whatever sequel they cook up... I get that Hollywood needs to do this for money. However, in this film they just dropped the ball entirely. There was no closure at all with this film. You still don't know the Woman in Blacks motivation, she will still continue killing kids in the village, and where they go in the sequel (which I will not watch now) odds are good you still won't get closure nor even the basic understanding of what this pissed off ghost wants.

Summed up, they introduce a pissed off ghost, give you the reason it's pissed off, offer a VERY plausible way of calming said pissed off ghost, reveal that in fact that did not work and it's still pissed off and they gave no others reasons why its pissed off.

Two stars are for the acting and set as well as the build up of the plot. Any other ending and I would give it more stars",1447372800,3,1773,4.249258160237389

4735908,2,B005LAIGOQ,"I skipped my way through this story. There were unnecessary long, dry, boring spells which were supposed to heighten the sense of dread, but only caused a snore to erupt from me. This story could have been told in less time, but if stretched, could have had a side story. Neither of these happened. There's a man who has to prove to his tired boss that he can handle a lousy lawyer's job in the country in England. He's a widower who needs his job, so he goes with plans to meet his son and the nanny in the countryside when the job is finished in a few days.
In the meantime, he sees a woman in black.  She comes and goes. Kids die when she's been seen. Nobody in town likes the idea of this lawyer going out to this haunted house to go through the late owner's papers, but no one tells him why, even though telling him wouldn't stop him, and it would sure help the viewer, by condensing some of the obviously pregnant stares, and giving us information we really could use, if only to stave off boredom.
Eventually someone tells him, he's annoyed that he wasn't told before, and he realizes his own son is coming to this place where kids are forced to commit their own deaths. The ending is like one of those internet videos..""you won't believe what happens next:"" Yes I would. I didn't expect it, but I would.",1445385600,,1311,4.3076923076923075

This movie is tense and full of dread. A classic unraveling of a ghost's motivation. It almost has more in common with Asian horror movies about a curse, but set in Victorian England. If you like period horror, ghost stories, or Daniel Radcliffe, I highly recommend this movie.",1444780800,,441,4.594936708860759

I liked the eeriness of it and the subtle hint at scaring you instead of the usual blood and gore. Very refreshing to see the young boy actor transform into a man actor who can hold his own.

4736199,5,B005LAIGOQ,"This is a solid ghost story. It doesn't rely on the typical gore and bloodshed that typifies Hollywood horror today. It actually has a REAL PLOT! Imagine that! Not only is the story good (and decently true to the book on which it's based; I recommend Susan Hill's novel as well), it's scary. This movie is, to me, more terrifying than the Exorcist. I honestly screamed the first time I saw it (luckily my friends and I were the only ones in the theater!). And I'm a total skeptic in real life--I don't believe in ghosts in the least, but when watching this movie, I was as scared as if it were all actually happening to me.

In this Woman In Black film, Daniel Radcliff is convincing and smart as a widower who goes to a small town and witnesses mind-boggling tragedies of children dying.  The more he visits a haunted house, the more tragedy grows around him.

As time runs out, Daniel Radcliff makes a brave and logical choice in the hopes of saving his son's life as The Woman In Black draws nearer.

He is a legendary player that will go down as one of the best players in history.  But getting back to the point, catching Pokmon takes skill no matter if your a genin or Jonin.

The effects were much louder than the actual dialogue which was kind of annoying but not dreadful. My biggest complaint is about the woman who plays the nanny for Radcliffe's son. She plays the leading character on BBC's ""Call the Midwife"" and is a fabulous actress and was basically only hired to be pretty, smile, cross over, look over her shoulder and pout.

4738488,4,B005LAIGOQ,"This is a movie in the traditional haunted house style with mercifully-few over-the-top special effects and CGI. It relies on an a eerie atmosphere of dread and suspense. Set in the 1920s, the back story revolves around the unending grief and eternal revenge that lay dormant in spirits that once lived at Eel Marsh House. The manse can be reached by a ribbon of road winding from the village through a sea marsh to a rocky island, but accessible only at low tide. Good performances all around. The abandoned mansion is place with no redemption. Never any chance that this place might someday be turned into a B&B or wedding venue. If you like ghost stories in the traditional mold -- empty English manor house, foggy graveyard, people in the village exchanging knowing glances but saying little to ""outsiders,"" an intense crescendo of suspense -- this is your kind of movie. Scares aplenty, very little gore relative to most paranormal movies.",1439596800,,944,4.869565217391305

Ciaran Hinds, as always, is fun, but Daniel Radcliffe's determination and stoutheartedness convey a character who is far too Harry Potterish.

It may not appeal to the younger generation because it doesn't fulfill the horror, blood and gore that many newer movies showcase. Instead it offers edge-of-your-seat suspense along with a lot of noise and visual thrill build-up to keep you engaged in the storyline. To get away from the violence and doldrums of most computerized technology based movies, this one fits the bill. Radcliffe fulfills his role in his shy, yet overly inquisitive character who seeks out to find the answer to the many puzzles of the story. 5 Stars!",1438041600,,634,4.990566037735849

4739903,4,B005LAIGOQ,"While I wasn't particularly impressed with the story, nor did I find this movie particularly frightening, I feel that it deserves a high rating for what it contributes to the horror genre: child death.  In much of the horror genre children are given a sacred space.  Generally speaking, children don't die.  If they are put into danger they are quickly rescued from it.  If a monster comes it backs away from the child, granting hi or her immunity.  When a child does die it usually happens outside of the film story line, just revealing that one of the adult characters is bothered by the loss of a child elsewhere.  This child worship was recognized and manipulated to create a series of films in which children are the monsters as well, raising the moral dilemma of killing a child character on-screen or letting the child monster succeed, usually favoring the latter.  When a child monster is killed it is usually under the premise that the child is actually an adult (human or other) disguised as a human child.
Then we introduce ""The Woman in Black"".  This film challenges the idea of children as protected in dangerous situations by creating a monster (ghost) that ONLY KILLS CHILDREN.  By the end of this film a viewer is likely to realize that even though there were some jump scares, they can still go home feeling safe because odds are they are outside of the age range of the monster's demographic.  My friends who have children claim a different experience because it expresses the vulnerability of their children and  plays into their own fears of losing a child (which probably makes this film more effectively frightening for parents).  With this barrier being broken I hope that future horror films will recognize the vulnerability of child characters and juxtapose our expectations of children being safe characters in the film with child death in order to create more terrifying films- ones that make you realize that nobody is safe.",1436486400,,1952,4.846385542168675

I don't always expect movies to obey the rules of my reality, but I expect them to have consistent sets of rules in the context of their realities. I felt that *The Woman in Black* lacked that consistency and at times relied too much on jump-scare horror rather than the atmosphere it seemed to be trying to create.

The ending is TERRIBLE, though, as it basically seems like the writers procrastinated until publishing day, then pulled an all-nighter to come up with something vague and completely derailed (pun intended, you'll see) from the ongoing plot until that point.

That being said: if you have Amazon Prime, therefore making this movie free, go for it.  It's not a horrible movie, and therefore might be fun to watch with friends and drinks.  Especially if you're of the movie snob/theatre type.",1433030400,,723,5.0

Whilst I was amazed author scared i got from watching the stage version, I was equally impressed the the growing sense of impending doom that the film brings. Daniel Radcliffe puts in a fine performance as Arthur Kipps and blows away his Harry Potter image well.

A solid, broody, atmospheric ghost flick in which Daniel Radcliffe might not say much, but he still delivers the goods.  A few cliched thrills don't detract because its a classic tale and one expects classic scares. And I jumped quite a few times. Just sayin.",1431561600,,430,4.618421052631579

The movie has its confusing moments, as well - but that seemed to help add to the gothic-horror taste of the movie. Normally I enjoy reading the book more than watching a movie based on a book, but found these played well together and helped me understand some of the little nuances of the book thanks to the great acting and terrific setting. Thanks to viewing this on Prime, I'm adding the movie to my DVD collection as a permanent part of my movie library. Along with the book!",1430611200,,596,4.378378378378378

4742280,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Before I get to the review, first let me say congratulations to Daniel Radcliffe for shaking off the role that made him a household name and moving on with a surprisingly solid performance in this picture. As I watched the movie, I actually forgot all about his previous character, and was drawn in by this NEW character. Radcliffe is a young man now, and he did a splendid job in this dark ghost story. I must shamefully admit that I almost didn't watch the movie because, I too, could not imagine Harry Potter all grown up and having the audacity to try to pass himself off as anyone else BUT our hero from Hogwarts!  Well, he deserves some serious recognition for his acting skills...Because he CAN act in other roles. He CAN make you forget about the young boy that was a famous wizard! Maybe he will NOT suffer the fate of so many others that were forever doomed by playing such a popular role. It's happened time and again and the young superstar tragically fades away into obscurity. And not only did  Radcliffe do good work in this movie, ALL the actors involved did very well. As a matter of fact, I have a hunch that if more people KNEW how good this movie was they would have watched it. But, they were probably still grieving the end of the famous series by JK Rowling! Anyway, I am confident that we will be seeing a lot more of Radcliffe. ***Here's a short summary on this haunting movie: A young and upcoming lawyer is on the verge of losing his job. The depression brought on by the death of his wife during childbirth is beginning to affect every aspect of his life. He gets one more chance to snap out of it before he loses everything. He is sent to settle the affairs of an old estate. But from the very moment he arrives, he is shunned and avoided by the small towns inhabitants. He is warned to stay away from the house, because if he persists, he will bring about the wrath of a vengeful spirit. ***
  This was a pretty cool watch. I thought I'd check it out before watching the recently released, The Woman In Black 2... And I am glad I did. Watch this, it's worth the price of a rental.",1430352000,5,2110,4.334177215189873

This horror movie is too much the same as other typical haunted house horror movies even though it tried to mix things up a little.

Everything seen felt all too familiar and not much of a significant difference.

4743834,3,B005LAIGOQ,"I am a huge horror fan. I like the old school 80's ghost stories like ""The Lady in White"" and I love the slasher films, too. There's hardly a horror film I don't find some value in.

With this film, I agree with a lot of the four-star-rating comments, but I think this film moved along way too slowly, for one. Secondly, I love large, scary old houses, and since this house was actually one of the main ""characters"" in the film, I was very disappointed for one reason - the film was shot WAY TOO DARK, so that you could hardly enjoy or even see in most scenes what the layout of the house was like.

Yes, I understand, most of the movie, he's traipsing around the house with only a tiny candle and an axe, but dear god, people! There are things such as The Red Camera that exist and can make the darkest rooms visible! Darkly shot films can be effective and do have their place in cinema, but not when I'm getting a headache trying to see what little black shadow in a sea of black just flickered. For me, this effort in trying so hard to see through this dark lens turns into boredom and I admit I have watched this movie probably 3 times because I kept falling asleep.

I am disappointed because I really thought for once in a long time, I could be watching a very good ghost story. The ending was nice, so I am glad I finally pushed through the entire film, but the rest was just foreboding music, and vague figures and a bunch of screaming. 3 Stars for ""It's Okay"" is bordering the rather generous..",1427846400,2,1503,4.229965156794425

A rage carried over from the other side...never underestimate a mothers love, not even when she is dead.......Boo! Daniel Radcliffe delivers a good performance, and so does the cast of characters. A little bit on the fake horror, some parts unbelievable. In my opinion, some of the movie was a bit over the top. Great scenery, cinematography was very eye catching. Over all an okay film, not one I would rush to the movies and pay money for. I really enjoyed Mr. Radcliffe and it was refreshing, for me, for the first time to see  him in something over than the boy Wizard...nice change.",1426723200,,651,4.7105263157894735

I don't think the scriptwriters and directing missed one hackneyed cliche from just about every horror movie that has ever been made. The filming angles completely predicted what was coming next (e.g. the close up of the protagonist, the sound track builds, he turns, and oh no! Horrors!). Ho hum.

I was taken back to times when movies surrounded you. It gave me a real sense of being there; it kept me interested from the beginning to end and I was able to relate to many characters not just one.

It's pretty hard to find a scary movie these days that is not completely awash in blood and gore.  I enjoy movies that take their time and build atmosphere and suspense.  I like things that go bump in the night, etc.  This fit the bill.  The costumes and sets were great and the acting very solid.  More like a 1940's suspense drama than a 21st century slasher flick.

This is the first film I've seen Daniel Radcliffe in since his ""Harry Potter"" days, and he does a very good job in this film. It is different, somewhat low key and not so much ""in your face scary"" the way some movies are. With ""The Woman in Black"" there are scenes that you have to watch closely to see all of the little things that are hidden in the shadows. For a horror movie, I find it rather relaxing to watch.

Radcliffe's London based lawyer character is sent to close out the affairs of a dead woman in a small coastal town, and of course that job proves much more difficult and much deeper than presented. DR does a great job as a slightly discomfited, fish-out-of-water in a town that goes to great lengths to hide its secrets. Hauntingly shot, the visuals and musical score contribute to the near constant tension and some truly ""made you jump"" scares. That said, I found the ending to be very disappointing...a deus ex machina that comes from left field to tie things up too quickly and neatly. I enjoyed the film greatly, but the end left me feeding cheated and deprived of a truly satisfying resolution.",1422921600,,786,4.786764705882353

They tried to write an original story line (which is much needed these days) and it was creepy but made no logical sense.  At one point I said to myself ""if he goes back to that house, I'm turning this off."" also, *kind of a spoiler* the ""climax"" ended up not helping; which i found to be dissatisfying and ironically anticlimactic. Maybe if it had been longer (or more scares) with less explaining and more left for the audience to figure out--It would have been the horror film it was intended to be and less on the thriller side. IMHO",1422057600,,692,4.40625
4746321,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I'm probably being a little critical only giving it 4 stars.  On a 1-10 scale I'd give it 8.5 or close to 9.  In the hands of some directors, photographers, and actors...this could have been another cheesy horror movie.  But in the hands of those here, everything was elevated and worked together to create a beautiful, haunting movie.

Daniel Radcliffe did a heck of a job as the main character, displaying proper emotion throughout.  Ciaran Hinds plays the eccentric and knocked it out of the park from the moment he opened his mouth, I didn't even know he could act like that.  And they even managed to have the child actors fit perfectly in their roles.

Some stuff must not translate to the screen, so I may never know the motivation behind some of the actors.  But they all had backstories to their characters you could tell they knew, and it gave real depth to what could have been a few roles as extras.  For example, why was the lady of the Inn so empathetic to Radcliffe?  Why was Radcliffe's boss such a jerk?  What had Radcliffe done wrong to be given this ""warning"" when sent to process this event?  Why was the nanny on the severe and cold side?  Why didn't the local lawyer just pretend to move things smoothly along instead of basically instigating the participation from the big city guys?  None of it really matters, but I mention it to point out they all took their roles seriously and you could tell there was more than just surface involvement in the film.

Add to that the great use of the visuals and you elevate what could have been an average story in the hands of someone else.  I have to the give the director credit for allowing all of this to be pulled off.

And yes, I'll admit I did think about this movie when I woke up in the middle of the night last night...which was a little scary.  Usually it's not a big deal to watch a horror, they are easy to forget because they so often disappoint.  But this one left me thinking, so job well done in this case.",1421971200,,1986,4.377049180327869

I almost stopped watching it a couple of times and am so glad that I didn't .

The movie slowly builds showing tidbits of ghostly visions. The viewer slowly gets sucked into the story nd you find yourself wanting to know more about what's going on.

With an excellent cast & locations and an experienced director there is loads of Gothic atmosphere and some excellently unexpected jumps I really rather enjoyed this classic Hammer horror. There is, however, a big but. Poor Daniel Radcliffe will never escape his Harry Potter persona. Eel Marsh House might as well have been Hogwarts and the eponymous woman could have easily have been Lord V for all the difference it made to Harrys, sorry Arthurs, performance and this seriously undermined the necessary suspension of disbelief required to enjoy any horror story.

4746634,5,B005LAIGOQ,"The original film was excellent and different. This film is also excellent and different. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using an older film as long as it is treated with due respect. Both were eerie, suspenseful and beautifully atmospheric movies. The British seem to excel at these atmospheric films for reasons of history, culture, and fabulous locations. While both films had different endings, they were both very enjoyable for my wife and I. By the way, there is nothing wrong with a ""happy ending"". Modern horror film makers seem to often make pessimistic, nihilistic, and even depressingly dark films. Good over evil, is a theme that should be returned to. As a Christian, we are well aware of evil and its inevitable demise. Moderns alas, have a strong anti religious bias and absolutely no concept of evil as seen in theological terms. G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown mysteries have the good Jesuit priest/amateur detective solve crimes in a different way than Sherlock Holmes. Father Brown uses his knowledge of human nature and especially the evil that exists to solve crimes rather than by purely deductive reasoning. Father Brown not only solves crimes but he tries to save souls. He is one up on old Sherlock there.",1420934400,,1237,5.009708737864078

I wondered why Daniel Radciff would pick a scary movie to transition with but now I see he made a good decision. Yes, I am guilty of thinking why Harry Potter would be frightened by anything in the movie. However, I soon was enjoying the character he was portraying. While it could have done fine without soooo many shots of creepy hallways, it did reflect the atmosphere of the movie. Knowing there was going to be a sequel you don't see why until the end.  It was nice to see a scary movie that wasn't all about scaring you with blood & guts rather than a well written and acted story. It did have many surprising things happen that made me jump, but they were entirely story related.  You always have to wonder why, with all the ominous warnings etc. from the villagers, he would insist on staying all night in a creepy house alone but for a very brave dog.  In fact, who knows what would have happened if he didn't have the dog to warn him.  The ending was a good one.",1420502400,,1081,4.305418719211823

Arthur Kipps (Daniele Radcliff) plays his part as a representative of a London law firm very well. Having to spend nights sorting out papers to sell the old mansion entrusted to his law firm for sale he experiences more than he cares to. Radcliffe must spend these nights in Eel Marsh House due to the tide washing over the causeway (actually Osea Road) twice daily, not allowing travel otherwise. He experiences many occurrences of the supernatural while there.

4750565,1,B005LAIGOQ,"The general consensus seems to be it was good, however I have to strongly disagree. It was one of the worst horror films that I've ever seen. Ive always been a fan of classic horror so the Women In Black looked promising. However I ended up fighting for the first 45 minutes to pay attention because it was so dull.

4750705,5,B005LAIGOQ,"We picked up this movie on Amazon Instant Watch because we've been considering heading out to the theatre to see the sequel.  On the whole, I think we were pretty glad that we did.

The nutshell view on this is that our protagonist is sent off to a spooky house to tidy up some probate paperwork after the death of the house's last inhabitant.  When he arrives, the townspeople do everything in their power to get rid of him and refuse to explain why they're acting so oddly.  The rest is left as exploration for the prospective watcher.

To the positive, the imagery in the movie is, at times, extremely creepy.  At various points old toys are shown and I found these delightful for their historical background and as a motif for the film.  Lots of wonderful images in this movie.  Further, the whole story didn't succumb to the standard pattern you typically see in these movies.  I can't really say much more without spoiling it but suffice to say that you don't get what you expect in the end and the final twist is shocking and delightful.

To the negative, many of the horror details were very cliche: lots of doorknobs turning and when the door is opened nobody is there, briefly glimpsed faces in mirrors or in windows and mysterious shadows.  This is all standard horror movie fluff and while well done is was just like every other horror movie in the world.

In summary, this movie is heavy on imagery, setting and narrative arc but many of the details are rather blah.  As horror movies go it was high on my list simply because it didn't run the usual course of 'good, then bad, then even more bad, then better, then REALLY bad, then yay, rainbows and unicorns!'

PS: I hope my review was helpful.  If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that youd want to know.  I always aim to improve.",1420156800,15,1814,4.435045317220544

Although this movie is touted in the horror genre it is more of a mystery in my opinion with a few bits of horror tossed in that aren't really all that horrifying. Ending is quite satisfying though.

If you're a fan of the kid who played Harry Potter (he's all grown up in this flick) and/or you like mystery/horror then you'll probably agree with my son who wanted to give this 4 stars. Otherwise...",1420070400,,490,4.212765957446808

4752895,4,B005LAIGOQ,"A very interesting and enjoyable little horror film, almost a throw back to those old haunted house thrillers from a few decades ago.  While definitely in color, the lighting scheme almost suggests those old black and white films.

A young solicitor still getting over the death of his wife is sent to a lonely house to finish up the paper work of a recently deceased woman.  He is alone in the house - or is he?  Most of the villagers avoid him, but is it because he is a stranger in their little community or do they know or fear something?  Is there something supernatural going on here or is the young man losing what's left of his sanity?

There is minimal blood and gore here and much more of an emphasis on creepy atmospherics and the occasional shock appearance.  Actor Daniel Radcliffe, stretching his acting wings after all those years as Harry Potter, does a fine job as the central character, and the supporting cast is well chosen.  The film is bathed in period detail and spooky darkness where things are barely visible or might be glimpsed off to the side.  I am not surprised to see that the famed British horror studio Hammer had a hand in this and it is good to see that venerable company back in action again.

Why four stars instead of five?  The film has a melancholy one note from the opening frame to the last, with little variety, and the story takes a little while to get moving.  But this film is not going for the blood stained effect every ten minutes.  Instead it slowly builds toward some genuinely creepy moments.  This film doesn't want to gross you out, but gradually unnerve and disturb you.  It's a more old fashioned approach to the horror genre, but fans of this type of film will enjoy ""The Woman in Black.""",1418688000,,1745,4.477848101265823

4752949,5,B005LAIGOQ,"To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, however. It is a wonderful, atmospheric ghost story, with all the trappings of a good gothic horror, that really sucked me in. Rather than going for gore or cheap scares, this movie sets up a spooky atmosphere in a superstitious, rural small town, far removed from the modernism of the city, and adds in a creepy local legend for added creepiness. People who liked movies such as What Lies Beneath or The Others will probably like this. I will agree with other reviewers, it does move a bit slowly, but makes up for that in really setting up the atmosphere and story line.",1418688000,,660,4.554621848739496

4752951,5,B005LAIGOQ,I love atmospheric horror movies. This movie redeemed a couple terrible ones I just saw as far as making me feel like I just saw a great movie. I watched The Omen remake from 20006 earlier and was so dissapointed because the haunted ominous atmosphere of the original was not in the new one. Woman In Black has it though. I'd also recommend The Changeling with George C Scott from the late 70s or early 80s.,1418601600,,407,4.368421052631579

The film would have been more frightening and suspenceful if the screenwriter had kept with the story in the novel. The film doesn't reveal the ""Woman in Black"" all that well. The film is dark, and, when she is to be seen, she is mearly a darker shadow. In the book she is fully seen even to Kipp's detailed description of her. The book begins on Christmas Eve with Kipp and his family sitting around the tree, and the children want to tell ghost stories. The children beg Kipp to tell one, and, with much pleading, he agrees. Hence the story of the woman in black. The kicker is that the story is true.

4754317,3,B005LAIGOQ,"Ok. So heres my review of the movie, which I originally saw in the movies when it was first released in 2012.

WARNING: SPOILERS.

As an aside, let me say this: I kind of wish I had gone to see it during the week, between the hours of 8:00 AM and 3: 00 PM, or to a very, very late showing on the weekend.

Why?

Two words: Daniel Radcliffe.

Yes, it seemed that every single teenage and/or barely-teenage girl (and boy) in central New Jersey wanted to see this flick. Im not kidding. The Harry Potter fan base came out to this movie in DROVES. I first went to the East Brunswick Mall in Central New Jersey to see it, and the 7:40 PM show was 9 tickets shy of being sold out; the only available seating was in the front row. So I left, and drove down to the Loews Theater in Freehold for their 9 PM showing. I had my ticket in hand by 8:15 and literally stood in line outside theater #7 to make sure I could get a decent seat when they finally began letting us in. By 8:45 the theater was jammed, packed to the gills, and it looked (and sounded) like a high school auditorium before a pep rally. It seemed that the crowd which had been there for the previous showing were rowdier than the theater management liked; once we were seated  but before the movie started - two ushers came into our theater and basically gave a speech explaining that the audience had to behave, or people were going to be ejected (they had had some problems with the previous horde of prepubescent Potterphiles). It worked; the crowd at our 9 PM showing was very well behaved indeed. Which, as anyone whos ever been to the movies with me will tell you, is a very, very good thing.

Right, so on to the film then (sorry, Im still thinking in Edwardian English). If you are already familiar with the original novel by Susan Hill, OR the extraordinary stage play adapted from the novel, then there will be very few surprises for you in the movie, at least in terms of the plot structure. Since Ive read the novel AND was lucky enough to see the London stage production of The Woman in Black in the West End, Im going to review this movie from the point of view of someone who has a certain frame of reference already; your mileage may vary.

The basic story is the same as the novel. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young solicitor in turn-of-the-century England who is sent by his firm to a remote coastal village called Crythin Gifford, there to settle the estate of the recently deceased elderly widow, Alice Drablow. Ms. Drablow lived alone in an aged, isolated mansion called Eel Marsh House, which is situated on a sort of island out in the middle of the tidal marshes, only accessible by a long narrow winding road from the mainland (at low tide; the road is underwater at high tide), known as the Nine Lives Causeway. When Kipps arrives in Crythin Gifford and begins digging into the life of the deceased Alice Drablow, he experiences inexplicable and terrifying phenomena, punctuated by the appearances of a spectre known as the Woman in Black; and he uncovers the story of a tragedy that has left the town  and its children - cursed.

Most of the primary elements of the novel are here, as are all its main characters: Kipps, Daily, the local taxi-driver Keckwick, even Keckwicks dog Spider (though the dogs name is not mentioned in the film). Familiar plot points are faithfully reproduced from the novel  Kipps first meeting with Daily on the train to Crythin Gifford; the sea fret (fog) that sweeps in over the Nine Lives Causeway, out of which Kipps hears the ghostly sounds of what sounds like a tragic accident involving a horse and carriage; the tiny graveyard on the grounds of the sprawling, decrepit hulk that is Eel Marsh House; and the ghostly manifestations of the titular ghost. The acting is solid throughout. The costume design, sets, and visual/sound effects are absolutely top-notch; and the music is - if not particularly memorable  at the very least, unobtrusive. That said, this version of The Woman in Black has stripped the original story and characterizations down to their absolute bare bones, while making some pretty significant changes (and adding numerous embellishments which were not present at all in Susan Hills novel).

But of course, the question is: how is the movie?

And the answer is its OK.

Daniel Radcliffe got some flack for his performance in this film, and while I can understand how difficult it is NOT to constantly think of Harry Potter every time Radcliffe appears on the screen (which is about 99.999999% of the time), I don't think the criticism is entirely justified. Radcliffe does his best with what hes given to work with - which is not a whole lot. Its obvious about ten minutes into the film that this isn't going to be a character-driven story. He has remarkably little dialogue in the film, and the scenes which develop his character are short and somewhat perfunctory. Also, since Kipps starts off the movie already in a morose, depressive state of mind (saturated with grief over the having lost his wife in childbirth four years earlier), theres not a lot of dynamic to how his character reacts to the ghostly happenings later on.

Actually, now that I think about it, NONE of the characters had much dialogue (there was more talking going on in The Artist, and that was a silent movie). The thing about The Woman in Black is that its primarily trying to generate suspense  and that it does, mostly with long, drawn-out scenes of Kipps walking around Eel Marsh House in the dark. Theres build-up after build-up; unfortunately, the payoff isn't always worth it. The movie starts off strong, with a creepy, disturbing little vignette involving three little girls, but as it goes along the script resorts far too often to boo type scares which feel cheap and somewhat predictable. You can see most of them coming a mile away. Im not sure why the filmmakers chose to do this  perhaps they felt the original story was simply too quaint and old-fashioned for todays movie audiences, and so they said Hmm, okay, nothings happened for about five minutes - lets have something jump out right here, and make a loud noise on the soundtrack, etc. etc Not that this is anything new in horror movies, but it was not the kind of thing that made the novel - or the play  so effective.

The changes/additions which have been made to the original story are significant. When Kipps arrives in Crythin Gifford, the townspeople reject him outright, with the exception of the Dailys. At one point, the men of the town practically form a lynch mob with the intent of driving Kipps out of town, since they believe he will be stirring up trouble by going to Eel Marsh house. Theres also a Mrs. Daily in this version, and she also happens to be a medium (groan) who can channel the spirit of her dead son; this, apparently, so as to provide us with important exposition. During the course of the film, there are multiple deaths, all children, all victims of the Womans curse, all quite nasty. Speaking of the Woman, shes not alone in this version; shes got ghostly company. The lands around Eel Marsh House are also haunted by the ghosts of her victims (which doesnt quite make sense, but there you go). Theres enough of them that the movie could have been called The Woman in Black - And Friends.  Other changes are simply inexplicable: the aforementioned phenomenon where Kipps hears the ghostly carriage crash in the fog out on the causeway is depicted but once - and then the filmmakers actually SHOW the accident as it happened, thus trashing any suspense or mystery involving the source of the sounds.

The biggest change of all, however, happens towards the end of the film, when Kipps thinks hes figured out a way to put the vengeful ghosts to rest once and for all (think the American version of The Ring). Theres a bit too much suspension of disbelief involved, which I won't get into here; suffice to say its a pretty big detour from the original plot, and while I understand the desire by the filmmakers to put some sort of exclamation point on the story, it just feels like it comes out of nowhere.

The movie does look incredible; indeed, the production design really is the star here. The short glimpse of 19th century London in the beginning looks fantastic and it makes you wish there had been more of it in the film. The village of Crythin Gifford is a vision right out of an H.P. Lovecraft story. The costumes and props (check out the cars!) are as good as it gets in a period drama of this type. Eel Marsh House is an absolutely amazing creation, surrounded by brambles and weeds like Sleeping Beautys castle by way of Charles Addams. Its interior is spacious yet oppressive: dark, festooned with cobwebs, and tarnished with a patina of black soot that seems not entirely a product of the candles that Kipps is obliged to carry with him as he traipses the halls. Think the visual stylings of Sleepy Hollow MINUS the weird, funhouse distortions and unrealism, and youll have a pretty good idea of this films accomplishments.

Note to Tim Burton: THIS is how you do a period piece, bro.

To sum up  the film does have its genuine frights, but sadly it also has far too many jack-in-the-box type scares, which ultimately don't stay with you. Daniel Radcliffe does an okay job with what probably amounts to about two whole pages of dialogue, and since most of the movie centers on him, it makes for a fairly quiet two hours (unless you count the music and sound effects). Theres never really enough character development or exploration of the relationships of the various characters (like, for example, Alice Drablow and Jennet Humphrye) to get the viewer all that emotionally invested in the film. The Woman in Black is eerie, and atmospheric, but its probably not going to give you nightmares. It doesnt get under your skin like the West End play (which was also adapted from the novel) does.

Which makes one wonder; how on earth can a stage play be more frightening than a movie?

4754318,1,B005LAIGOQ,"The acting is fine, the sets, the costumes, that's all fine. But frankly, this one was pretty boring. Nothing substantial happens until more than half way through the film, and when it does start to happen, it's all cheap scares - jumping out at the audience kind of things. And *Spoilers* the fact that the woman in black only attacks when she's been looked at is just plain silly. The ending was bad and cheap.  Didn't feel like there was much of a climax to this one.

4754852,3,B005LAIGOQ,"This movie had a number of suspenseful, scary scenes and I loved the geographic area where it was filmed. But there was much of the story line that I felt could have been ""better written"". Daniel Radcliffe's character ""Arthur Kipps"" saying ""I think I'll work through the night"", seemed ridiculous to me after all he had already come to find out about the house and ""The Lady"". For so many frightening things going on, Radcliffe seemed to be quite indifferent to it all. Like he was there, but his mind wasn't.  I also would have chosen someone else to play ""The Woman in Black"".  Someone who would have blown people out of their seats when they finally saw who was playing her. Like Catherine Zeta Jones, Tilda Swinton, Rebecca De Mornay, Monica Potter, or Sarah Douglas. I hope the director does a better job if he is planning on filming a sequel.",1415318400,,848,4.572368421052632

This is a well-made traditional ghost story and while it doesn't have the reputation of Ju-On it has quite as dire a situation, perhaps even more frightening. The locations and cinematography deliver a fantastic spooky and menacing atmosphere and Dan Radcliffe perfectly delivers a solid performance of a man stunned by his encounter with the supernatural, not quite believing, not quite daring to believe, until he can't deny the evidence of his own eyes.",1415318400,,504,5.158536585365853

A.  I'm sad.  Everything is dark.  B.  Why is everyone looking at me like I'm a ghost?  C.  Creep creep creep....ITS a GHOST!!!  Oh wait, no it's not.  D.  What's THAT????  Oh it's nothing.  Just a trick of the light.  E.  Camera pans up behind him.....WHOS BEHIND ME?!?!??!??  Oh no one.  Never mind.  F.  Senseless unrelated deaths.  G.  Let's fix a tragedy as the ghost tries to stop us blah blah blah.  H.  We're dead.  Yay!!!!!

This movie is not worth it.  Bad writing.  Tentative unfocused generic acting.  Ok scenery.  No real budget to speak of.  Cheap attempt at scares.  And while we're on the subject of awful stupid horror movies, Oculus is pretty stupid too.  Save your money on both.",1415232000,,883,4.483870967741935

Not sure why the villagers stayed, not sure what happened to the owner except she died, not sure why the boy was haunting the house - although other ghosts made some appearances, not sure why the villagers children were getting taken when they were not involved - there must have been some guilt there to trigger the haunting of the villagers (never forgive).

The movie does put you at the edge of your seat, although some of the scary moments were too predictable. i did not watch the old version, nor read the novel, so i do not know how it is supposed to end. However, that ending scene leaves something to be desired. Now, that was like a scene out of Harry Potter -  Kings Cross Station scene. That was OK for HP but certainly too ""corny"" for this movie.

4756968,3,B005LAIGOQ,"I was so excited to see they've revived  ""Hammer Horror"", if not the actual studio at least we get a releasing arm with the moniker. Based on Susan Hill's novel of the same name is the first mainstream film Daniel Radcliffe starred in post his ""Harry Potter"" series, and he does a good job of stepping away from the lightning bolted wizard he's associated with.

""The Woman in Black"" is the atmospheric tale of a widower, Arthur Kipps, struggling with the death of his wife and raising his young son. Kipps is in debt and in jeopardy of losing his job as a lawyer. His boss assigns him the task of selling an old estate, and organizing the papers of the deceased owner. Upon arriving at the dreary town, Kipps finds himself ostracized by the townspeople, and the people he does meet, try to hurry him out of town. Kipps soon learns that there are stories surrounding the old estate he is tasked with selling, and that the town fears the vision of a woman dressed in black, who when seen, causes the death of a child.

I like the atmosphere of this film, and the way the film is shot. Living up to it's namesake studio, this is a gothic horror tale with all of the bells and whistles. There are a few frights sprinkled here and there as Kipps explores the huge estate, but the fear in this film lies more with the mood than with the jump scares.

I think this is a semi-successful blending of classic Hammer Horror with newer ""Paranormal Activity"" type jumps tossed in occasionally. Radcliffe does a good job of making us forget ""Harry Potter"", but his Kipps is such a dull character, almost sleepwalking through the first 40 minutes or so of the film. I think the biggest problem with ""The Woman in Black"" is that every character is weird or mysterious, from the grieving mothers, to Kipps, to the inn keepers, there's just no one here to relate to.

If you're in the mood for a slow-burn horror film, give this a shot, it's a creepy movie with more depth than the latest ""Conjuring"" or ""Paranormal Activity"".",1413244800,,2009,4.478142076502732

4756971,2,B005LAIGOQ,"This is watchable if a little predictable and tedious at times. It's mostly a lightweight ghost story and mostly for fans of Daniel Radcliffe.

4757075,4,B005LAIGOQ,"This film really is one NOT to watch while alone. I read the book last summer whilst on vacation in England, but seeing the film added a whole other layer of horror to the experience. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at portraying the young attorney who obviously is not threatened by spooky sounds or unusual occurrences in the haunted house where he works on a dead woman's papers. The plot begins to thicken when he discovers the cover up that the papers lay open for him. The film (as well as the book) is an excellent example of Gothic horror.",1413158400,,548,4.435643564356436

4757272,5,B005LAIGOQ,"This brilliant, old-fashioned ghost story has the type of dread and tension that's hard to come by these days. Don't let the PG-13 fool you, this thing gets intense. Sure, there are some very classically slow moments of drama and character, typical of traditionally gothic horror and not for short-attention spans. But when things get going, it doesn't get much more frightening. There's one extended sequence in the film that ranks among the classics in terms of pure terror.

Most of the best frights are of the ""walking slowly towards a spooky thing"" variety, but there are still some fantastic jump scares that benefit from having the volume scream from 0 to 100 in a blink. The production design is fantastic too, with lots of great effort put into the house, pictures, landscape toys and ghosts to make everything as creepy as possible.

Throw in solid performances, a quality script, good sound and score, nice cinematography, and perhaps the film's only flaw is the sometimes brooding pace. Indeed, this film is a modern masterpiece in the horror genre.",1412726400,,1061,4.955056179775281

4757477,5,B005LAIGOQ,"I was drawn to watching this movie for several reasons.  I love the Harry Potter films, and therefore love the actor Daniel Radcliffe.  Also, the movie takes place in England, my favorite place.  The time period is around the very late 1800's, where candles light a dark house and cars are a recent novelty.

This movie begins in London where the main character accepts a work assignment to travel to an abandoned estate in the country.  His career with a law firm seems on shaky ground and this appears to be a do or die task for him to execute.  His wife passed away four years ago after giving birth to their only son.  He still mourns her loss and has sightings and dreams of her.

The journey to the estate is frought with bad weather and frightened stares from the residents nearby.  The general tone is that these people want him gone, but he's got a job to do.  The house is clearly haunted and hints of this build gradually from the getgo.  There isn't a boring moment in this film.  The evidence of haunting and the story behind it builds deliciously as the film progresses.  It's scary, interesting and touching all in one.

I wanted to see this film when it came out in the theaters a  year or two ago, but never got around to it.  I think it did well but not great when it was released,  This is a Prime Instant Video offering, so as a Prime member I got to watch this for free.  This movie was stellar and I highly recommend it.",1412380800,,1442,4.297397769516729

I attribute this to the miscasting of Daniel Radcliffe, not because of his prior work as Harry Potter, but because he did not deliver a performance worthy of the story being told. You will notice that his performance is stilted and ""one-note"". If he is not terrified or bothered by the unsettling events taking place, how can we? By the end of the movie we should either be applauding or in tears.

The is more polished than the first adaptation, which special effects and more jump moments, but it loses several key plot points which takes the punch away.  On its own it's a decent horror movie, but watch the original for some true terror",1411689600,,503,4.273684210526316

This is part of why I'd watch a thriller or a gore-fest horror film, for the background story. Radcliffe does alright as Arthur, the lawyer/ bank employee, something along those lines that comes to settle an old creepy estate. While the film is slow, that isn't the part that bothered me the most. The ending did not have a shred of resolution to it.

But I'll admit the settings were pretty nice. So for that it gets one star.,1411171200,,392,4.171052631578948
4758245,2,B005LAIGOQ,"This film is predicable and lacking in any real style.  It can best be summed up as a very poor imitation of Hitchcock's masterful style.  Where Hitchcock keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat this film has a clumsy and heavy handle interpretation of the style of Hitchcock.  Where Hitchcock would have the viewer holding their breath wondering what was coming next this film by 30 minutes into the film has the viewer going here we go again another ""scary"" moment.

The acting is also lackluster and over the top performances with Daniel Radcliffe providing overacted clues which scream the plot of the film prior to the action having actually taken place.  The film is sadly not the best performance of any of the actors of the production.

Even free with amazon prime streaming not worth the watch.  If you want horror in the classic sense versus the currently popular gore and guts do yourself a favor and get yourself a good Hitchcock - perhaps one you haven't seen before.",1411171200,,983,4.680232558139535

Look NO further!!!! That woman is darker than black! There are plenty of thorough reviews about Radcliffs' great acting and the great goth style thriller! All true!

My first thought is that it seemed to kinda drag on in parts that didn't need more screen time. The acting was not the weak point, the script was just kinda bland. You knew the story before it ever got off the ground because you've heard/read/seen it a thousand times before. There wasn't enough new here to really capture my attention. By the halfway mark I was more focused on the program I was working on than the movie, it just kinda faded into the background and I wasn't even remotely lost when I would re-engage the movie, because as I said, the story is so familiar. When it was over my reaction was, ""well that certainly was a movie, yessiree, sure was"". And now a week or so has passed and I've mostly forgotten it.",1410739200,,816,4.2709677419354835

4758742,4,B005LAIGOQ,"If the setting and atmosphere are important to you when watching a movie, this one will charm you.  The long shots of the marsh and the lonely road that must be taken to get to the house that is the main setting, are wonderful.  You know that someone already alone as Arthur's character, is; will spend more time alone.

The house he explores while looking for strange sounds and the like, is wondrous, each room is different and filled with Victorian/Edwardian clutter, and more papers for him to go through. His job there is to go through all of the documents in the house to make sure that the will on file is the newest one.  He keeps finding cards in bundles, and a series of letters.  He is also distracted often from his work, by the sounds of toys and periodic things that go bump in the night.

If you want a gory, bloody mess of a movie, please look elsewhere, this is more of an old-style movie where the story carries the sense of unease instead of pools of blood.

The first half of this story is really slow but the second half keeps you jumping and makes up for all the boredom suffered at the beginning. The ending isn't a happy one; more bitter-sweet. At least the last child the woman in black takes she doesn't keep, like the others.",1410307200,,395,4.2105263157894735

4759331,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I liked this movie.  I haven't been able to watch the end, because it got too scary for me!

Some folks have said it moves too slowly.  I don't think it does.  A movie moving ""too slowly"" is very subjective, and depends some on what generation a person is from, too.  The suspense is built up really well, with the traditional Gothic elements of the big house, stairway, lots of shadows, sheets over the furniture, and statues and dolls appearing as though they will come to life at any moment.  The silence in the film, along with exaggerated sounds of Arthur moving through the home and the sudden loud noises, add a lot of mystery.

Another criticism I read from a viewer is that Daniel Radcliffe is ""wooden"".  I don't think he is wooden!  He is a very good adult actor.  You can tell what he is thinking and feeling throughout the film, without him saying anything!  Plus, it is not uncommon for a character in a movie or a book to appear as an ""empty vessel"" because they are still grieving the loss of a loved one.

I watched this up to the point where Arthur discovers a huge secret within the Drablow family, from reading letters he had found.  So up to this point, I thought it was a really well done movie, with great acting.  I also like the message that Arthur's friend gives him, to ""not chase after shadows"".  It's something worth considering in real life.

Someday, I hope I can finish this movie, but it won't be today!  Too scary.",1410220800,,1447,4.4
4759332,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Entertaining Gothic horror in the vein of The Others, The Woman in Black never really aspires to be more than it is, which is why it works so well. It relies far more on mood and atmosphere than jump scares (of which there are some) or gore (none), which I think makes for a more enjoyable movie. Its one real problem is the casting of Daniel Radcliffe. He's a capable enough actor, but it's just nearly impossible to believe Harry Potter as an adult, let alone a morose widower.

The plot is fairly standard, as these things go: main character with some sort of personal tragedy for a backstory has, for some reason, to go visit an overly large and creepy home where some other tragedy occurred. Hauntings ensue, main character goes exploring when he should be running, et cetera, roll end credits. It breaks no new ground. Still, it's immensely enjoyable all the same, and not a bad way to spend a couple of hours in a dark house one evening.",1410134400,,944,4.488372093023256

4759338,3,B005LAIGOQ,"Watched this movie with my daughter, and we both felt the pace of this movie is too slow. It felt like a short story tortured  into a full length movie. I love suspense movies, but  this one did not have enough dialogue to move the story on a a good pace. It isn't until the last third of the movie that we get any real details as to the cause of the trouble. The actors are fine in their roles I just don't think they had enough to do except look pensive or distressed. There were a few good scenes to make you jump and plenty of creepy atmosphere, but this movie never was riveting for me.",1410048000,,591,4.042735042735043
4759339,3,B005LAIGOQ,"Pretty much a disappointment, all over. Radcliffe was wooden. Didn't necessarily fit his apparent character, either. For example, when stuff going on in the house was particularly mind shattering, he walked around at his normal gait and looked around at everything. No sense of fear, although we get the idea that inside he should have been frightened enough to extrude the proverbial fecal brick. (pardon the perhaps crass, altho perfectly apt, allusion)

There was supposed to be a psychodramatical link between him and the title character, although that was made apparent through what seemed a terribly cheap motif that repeated throughout the film. This added to the unbelievable nature of it.

At its best, this was a B-grade horror movie. Most of the time it rated C and D. Don't bother.",1410048000,,793,5.0458015267175576

4760150,3,B005LAIGOQ,When Americans started doing remakes of Japanese horror movies they had a very distinct style of jump scares and weird ghosts. Woman in Black feels like a Japanese remake rather than an old English tale of terror. It is not the strongest horror movie but is still pretty entertaining.,1409356800,,284,4.816326530612245
4760151,2,B005LAIGOQ,"Well, I'm not much of a horror movie fan.  I just wanted to see what Daniel Radcliffe was doing these days.  Honestly, I do think he's a good actor, but he still looks much too young to be believable in the role of the father of a 4-year-old.  That made it difficult to sink into the film.

As for the plot ... as I said, this is not my genre, but even so, the plot seemed pretty thin and repetitive.  The same sense of suspense, the same apparition, the same result ... I was really losing interest by the end.  And the ending ... just seemed wrong.  Dumb, in fact.

4760534,5,B005LAIGOQ,"This movie metaphorically scared the crap out of me.

From the moment I saw that this was available to view on Prime, I went back and forth on whether or not to watch it. I've been burned by so-called horror movies so many times that I have become very, very wary. Truly frightening ghost stories are few and far between. Why is supernatural horror so hard to get right? I suspect that the temptation to go over the top becomes too great for directors, whereas in my opinion as a viewer, it's slow and subtle that get it right.

This movie gets it right, and Daniel Radcliffe is brilliant in his role. He's come a long way since Harry Potter. There are scenes in this movie that are so thrillingly spooky, I think this could become a regular for my Halloween night viewing. How I wish more writers and directors would take note of how to tell a proper ghost story.

A lawyer still in grief over using his wife at childbirth is sent from London to a village to ""sort the papers"" of a recently deceased prominent lady. The inn keepers and village solicitor try to get him to leave as quickly as possible without actually visiting the house, but this job is on the line. Once he goes out to the mansion, set far from the village past the marshes, children in the town begin dying through tragedies. He is blamed--because he went up to the house. As he sorts through the papers and has some paranormal experiences he pieces together the facts behind a local legend that whenever anyone spots the Woman in Black who haunts the marshes looking for her son, she will appear to ""spell"" the town's children into tragic behavior. Now, to protect his own son, he feels he must put an end to the curse by reuniting the woman with her child.",1409011200,,951,4.44

If it were not for the wonderful acting of Ciaran Hinds who played a sympathetic villager and kept me watching until the end, I would have rated the movie a one star.  Although I often prefer a slower paced movie, this one did not seem to be moving at all.  Not particularly scary, just sad.  I was not drawn into the inner world of the main character, which could have made it more interesting.

One of the scenes involves lifting a corpse of a small boy out of a quicksand bog.  Problem, there should not be anything left of the body except bones.  Time has passed.  It is also difficult for me to buy that a man would love his deceased wife so much, that it would be ok with him  to die with his young son to be with her.  How about just loving the son, and bringing him up to become whatever he was meant to be.  That is enough dream for anyone.  To paraphrase Dumbledore, ""It does not do to dwell so much on the past, and forget to live.""

It's just a succession of strange decisions made by stupid people.  I hate it when there are suspense movies for which you feel the need to constantly yell at the characters for making stupid choices.  This was one of those movies.

4761993,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I read the 1 stars and the 5 star reviews.  What I like most about the 6 star review is that most ""get it"".  70's era horror based on classic Brit novels.  This reminded me of the 1981 Ghost Story, but was much more.  Scottish or Northern English type horror.  One of the bad reviews stated it was linear.  Yeah, it was.  And at the end when you thought the ghost was going to be satisfied, it wasn't (of course) and then when it takes it's most recent victims, it is satisfied and shows mercy. A weird twist but OK.  But you know it isn't done killing.  To dog this film out and compare or criticize it compared to the Potter series is off-base and pretty stupid.  Kinda like comparing the Vietnam war to any of the Gulf Wars. The comments come from an utter misunderstanding of the genre and an over abundance of feeling like you just have to say something and you vomit from the mouth.  Useless.  I'm not overly impressed with the film, but I had some raised hairs on the back of my neck, was entertained and was engaged, which is why I'm writing a review.  I just gotta say that the people that were overly critical might want to switch back to watching the movies Hollywood wants you to watch, and stop watching these independent-type films, because you obviously know what you like.",1408147200,,1288,4.361344537815126

He needs to do legal work in a house inhabited by the ghost of the woman in black whose child had died and whose body had never been found.

Only wish it would've ended differently but let me tell ya... if you're watching it to the very end, it's a creepy spooky ending. So... watch out for that!!",1408147200,,430,4.180722891566265

4762050,5,B005LAIGOQ,"There is a subtle genius to this movie.  Initially when it ended the group I was watching it with all said, ""Wait--what?  That's not right!""  In other words, it elicited a very strong reaction from us.  As I thought back on it, I realized that this movie was brilliantly done.  The acting, lighting, cinematography, etc worked together in a way that is more subtle yet powerful than the horror films I am used to seeing.  For instance, it starts out slow, and just when I was about to feel bored, something happened that made me jump out of my skin.  For the remainder of the movie, I focused more on the shadows and reflections in the background than I did on the characters' faces.  THAT is brilliance on the director's part!  Now, without spoiling it for anyone, I will say that we reacted as strongly as we did because our expectations were not met--and that is also a bit of brilliance.  This is a movie that I will recommend, and that I will watch again--not so much for the entertainment value of being frightened, but just to appreciate the genius involved in creating it.",1408147200,,1080,4.520618556701031

4762799,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Living out on an eel marsh where the sea mists blow, back in 1880's, in a big sprawling English mansion, was apparently a very bad thing.  However, for filming, it sure does create an interesting backdrop to ""Harry Potter"" actor, now adult, Radcliffe.  He is cast as a widower with debts and a small son (wife died in childbirth, naturally), and if he cannot straighten out the latest will and testament, his job at the law firm is over.  So off he goes to Creepyvillage, where everyone wants him out of there, yet he persists in digging into the past.  The past is hanging all around him in this dusty and cobwebbed mansion.  Doors slam and empty rockers rock.  Windows open and curtains blow.  Ghosts in old dresses (no male ghosts) appear here and there, up stairs, down int he garden, then vanish.

The widower character, Lawyer Mr. Kipps, is not a believer in ghosts.  That is a critical reason he can carry  on his spooky investigation through piles and piles of old papers.  He is fortified in this belief by a local man who offers to  drive him out across the marsh in his horse and carriarge, reassuring him that it is all nonsense what the locals say about the past and some daughters who killed themselves.

It is a pleasure to see former Harry Potter star Radcliffe all grown up
And dressed as an English lawyer of 1880's.  The boy playing his son is his own godson.  It is the story itself that May rancor a bit.  It is naturally all impossible to those who don't believe in the dead appearing as ghosts.  Nonetheless those who do or those who accept at least the premise, can enjoy a frightening, dark, misty, decaying and abandoned mansion and its former inhabitants rattling around and trying to rattle our lawyer Kipps.

His own dead wife is also a ghost and has a part to play in this.

Do the dead live on?  They do at least in the minds of those who
Knew them, loved or hated them.

Now that robin williams  is no longer with us, perhaps his ghost will appear as Mork.  I had always wanted to offer him
A part in a film I  am planning about San Francisco tourism.  He would
Be the driver of a big double decker bus as we'll
As the tourguide and he would crash into Eddie Mirphy. Driving a cable car of course.",1407801600,,2229,4.364963503649635

The atmosphere is scary, dark, somber, and the wonderful score by the awesome Marco Beltrami is good enough to make me sleep with the lights on.

Probably what I like the best about this movie is the fact that is not super-violent of gory, and the ending is just exquisite. This movie is a must-see for any horror fan.",1407801600,,587,4.185840707964601

4763068,3,B005LAIGOQ,"This is an average horror film that takes its name and a few of the plot points from a really superior Gothic novella.  THE WOMAN IN BLACK by Susan Hill is one of the scariest ghost stories I have ever read.  This 2012 film THE WOMAN IN BLACK while atmospheric and foreboding does not come close to the source material and some silly changes are made to the original for reasons that are inexplicable to me.  Daniel Radcliffe does do a good job as the hero, a young lawyer sent to an eerie, remote house in a well portrayed Edwardian Britain to settle the estate of a recently deceased woman.  Radcliffe's character in this version is  a widower and the father of a four year old child another plot change I didn't particularly appreciate.  If I had not read Hill's original novel I probably would have been much happier with this film that does have some merit but I feel it would have had a much better movie if it had been  more faithful to Susan Hill's original vision.  Apparently there are a 1989 made for British TV version that was well received as well as a long running West End play that are entitled THE WOMAN IN BLACK and follow Hill's work somewhat more closely.",1407542400,,1176,4.412037037037037

Actors did wonderful jobs.  We didn't think Daniel Radcliffe was too young to be a father/husband, like some said in their reviews.  He'll always be Harry Potter to some...but we thought he did a superb job.  This had a very old-film feel to it....it almost should have been black and white to complete the feel to it.  It wasn't the best movie we've ever seen, but it certainly kept us entertained throughout.  It was very bleak and somber.  It had that oppressive feel to it. .  Recommend this!!",1407542400,,664,4.495798319327731
4763071,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Very old-school frightening!  The mood, the characters, the backstories...all were played beautifully throughout the hugely suspenseful film.

Ciarn Hinds is an old favorite, of course, and Janet McTeer does a wonderful job in what is a limited role. Daniel Radcliffe is the heart of the movie and that heart shows in his eyes in every frame. Well done.

Scary? For. Sure. Glad I'm watching it on a bright, summer afternoon.

I don't know how it did it but the movie had the visuals down of a Vincent Price horror movie but lacked the ambience or character development.  The people in the town were angry, scared but you don't feel it.  Perhaps the book conveyed it better.  The only sense to be made of the ending is that we are not dealing with a mere Ghost or vengeful spirit but an entirely demonic thing.  The amends Radcliffe's character attempts to make to what he believes is a grieving spirit of a mother, is highly implausible in it's execution and successful retrieval. Truly a self-sacrificing act that no Demon would care about. Read how this movie begins and ends on Wikipedia before watching. Despite good the acting, directing and set design the movie fails to generate the ambience of eerieness and foreboding that a movie like this should. The entire movie is flat and emotionless.

4763301,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Daniel Radcliffe gives a memorable performance as Arthur Kipps, a London solicitor (attorney) and widowed father of a 4-year-old boy who is on thin ice with his firm due to non-productivity because of grief over his wife's passing. He is given one final chance to prove his value to the firm and keep his job: Go to the remote village of Crythin Gifford and settle the probate affairs of the rambling, secluded mansion of Eel Marsh House, whose tenants recently died. He soon discovers and becomes immersed in the macabre secrets of the house and village in this carefully told story.

THE WOMAN in BLACK is the sort of thing I didn't think could still be done these days, a gothic horror story about a haunted house with a clever, original plot and mythos, disturbing images but no schlocky gore for its own sake, and above all, genuinely frightening qualities. The question of whether or not Kipps will keep his job adds to the suspense. The cinematography is first-rate, with bleakly striking views of the English countryside and village. The early 1900s time period is captured most convincingly. Excellent acting by everyone else as well, particularly the various child actors and Ciarn Hinds as local resident Sam Daily.

4763305,4,B005LAIGOQ,"A strong 4 to 4 and 1/2 star movie. Not the scariest, not the most original, but a fine addition into the horror/thriller genre.

The Woman In Black is a very dark, atmospheric horror. Beautiful settings are used to great effect in creating an unsettling mood throughout the picture. The acting is good (but might require some subtitles at times for some deep British accents) and the special effects are also well done. The lighting was also appropriate for each individual scene. It was dark enough to create an uneasy mood, but light enough to see what was actually happening. Lighting is one of my pet peeves, but this movie pulled it off.

So I have to mention the flaws..... The story is good, but is mostly recycled ideas taken from other previous titles. I don't take away that many points for that though as it is rather difficult to scribe a completely original story in this day and age. It also changes these ideas up just enough to make the story its own. The only other knock against this film I could think of would be that it is rather slow at times. This is used to ramp up the mood in some areas, but can become rather dry in others. Still, the movies pace is pretty reasonable, which is why I still gave it such a strong mark.

In all, a surprising entry into the world of horror. It won't scare the pants off of you, but you'll get tension and, possibly, a few jumps!",1398556800,,1387,4.389105058365759

I don't like bloody/horror movies like the old Freddy Kruger movies or movies like ""Saw"" where you're scared because someone is being victimized by another person, and this movie definitely didn't have any features like that,  It was just suspenseful and creepy.

4763348,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Had I been able, I'd have given this three-and-a-half rather than four stars -- but it's closer to a four than a three.

As other reviewers have noted, this adaptation of the popular novel and play steers clear of ""slasher"" stunts (guts and gore) and instead focuses on atmospherics. Certainly the production design is decidedly Victorian Gothic, and the general tone is moody and disquieting. As Arthur Kipps, a young widower swept up in a haunted house, really a haunted village, mystery, Daniel Radcliffe acquits himself pretty well. His strongest scenes are those in which he has no dialogue. I don't mean that as a backhanded compliment; he shows an expressiveness through his body language that makes speech unnecessary. The rest of the cast is also solid.

This film is not consistently sure-footed. Unlike, say, ""The Sixth Sense,"" a ghost movie that always seems to know what its doing, ""The Woman in Black"" sometimes seems to toss out scares just for the heck of it, and some of them are predictable. A really rigorous analysis of the plot would probably reveal some holes and thematic inconsistencies. On the other hand, this IS a ghost movie. How demanding should we be? Particularly when the ending (again as other reviewers have remarked) manages to be ingenious, shocking, and ambiguous all at once.

The director said that although he set the film in Victorian England, he didn't want it to have a period feel; only a period look. To that end the dialogue is, depending on one's view, either jarringly or refreshingly modern. This is taken to a rather comical extreme when a woman is referred to in writing as ""Ms."" a prefix that didn't come into use until decades later. (It would be like referring to ""Ms. Jane Austen."")

This edition includes three bonus features: a making-of featurette, a piece on Radcliffe, and audio commentary with the director and the screenwriter. The making-of is short and moderately interesting; the Radcliffe bit is worthwhile to hear some of his insights on the character (and why on earth he stayed in that house, for goodness' sake!), but the commentary is a disappointment, consisting mostly of self-congratulations and the filmmakers ""wowing"" over their own creation.

But for all the minor criticisms, I certainly recommend this for anyone who likes old-fashioned spooky stories without the gore and profanity that mark modern horror.",1395014400,2,2386,5.015151515151516

The stark sets of the haunted town (Wales?) and the engulfing tidal bogs are real places which the inquiring sort of tourist can still find.

As far as the movie goes, I knew it was a ""thriller"" and not a ""horror"" movie. Big difference, I normally don't like/watch horror movies. I do love thrillers. This one had a bit of the horror aspect though. The movie itself was very slow. Was waiting for something to happen, and when something did it was just the same thing over and over again and at some point I just started rolling my eyes, waiting for something different to happen or a turn in the plot. Something. With the real antique toys and everything, it could have been SO much more! Could have been a lot better. It only really got better starting near the end as sad as that is, and then the very end had my eyes really big. (Although at the same time it didn't make sense to me why it ended so.) It's not one of those movies that leaves you hanging at the very end, at least not totally, which is something I really hate. The ending it great. I had thought I had definitely known how it was going to end out, but I was only partly right. There was a lot more there than I would have imagined. The movie will surprise you. I would say watching is worth it, for an experience. Purchasing it, definitely not... Besides, it is not one of those kinds of movies that you would want to watch over again anyway.

4763422,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I hadn't read the book before watching this movie.

As an author, I wanted to see how this subject was handled. I was interested in the pacing, the plot twists, the setting, and so on.

As a fan of Daniel Radcliffe, I wanted to see how he handled this kind of role.

In general, the pacing was slow, exactly as you'd expect from a classic gothic tale. The setting was a visual delight, and I recommend watching the movie with the commentary turned on (after seeing it, start to finish, without the commentary) to get the most from the way the movie was designed and produced.

Radcliffe's performance was remarkable.  Large portions of the movie focus on him, alone, in a mundane (but creepy) setting.  He has no dialogue in many (perhaps most) scenes.  Despite that, he's able to convey the emotions of the character, and maintain interest.  Frankly, his performance is so compelling, it's almost hypnotic.

Unfortunately, the movie isn't completely worthy of Radcliffe's efforts.

One major problem was: the movie didn't convey a solid enough ""character in his normal world"" foundation at the start of the film.  We're too quickly thrown into his grief. Almost from the start, Radcliffe's character is a haunted man. (No pun intended. ) We see him living his life in the shallow, by-the-numbers manner that many grieving people adopt while they recover from a stunning loss.

This film also falters due to some frankly cheesy visual elements.  I won't spoil the movie with details, because I think this IS a movie well worth watching, and owning for the special features included in the DVD.  However, the very last scene was such a cliche, it spoiled much of what had come before.  I couldn't help laughing when I saw it.

I feel that the director tried to be all things to all moviegoers.  If he'd remained more faithful to the book, or to a classic ""hero's journey"" plot, or committed to making this a date-night horror flick, the movie would have been more successful.  Instead, it's part art film, part horror, and it's not full satisfying on either count.

I'm reminded of the movie, ""The Haunting,"" based on Shirley Jackson's novel.  The 1963 version was a classic -- now a little dated -- and inspired Disney's ""Haunted Mansion"" attraction. However, the 1999 remake tried to be an updated, more socially relevant tale, and it failed badly. Like ""The Woman in Black,"" it lapsed into cliches at the end.

After seeing the movie, ""The Woman in Black,"" I read the book by Susan Hill. It's a modern classic and follows the well-worn traditions of gothic horror novels.  The tale is slow paced and reflective. The book is also very different from the movie, from start to finish.

All in all, I think devoted fans of gothic-style horror will enjoy this film enough to want to own a copy.  Just be sure it includes the special features.

And, for authors, this film is a good study of pacing, plotting, and what can make a story compelling, despite other shortcomings.  While part of that is a credit to the director and screenwriter, as well as the movie's visual design, I'd give most of the credit to Daniel Radcliffe. He portrays a man numbed by grief, with surges of frustration and plunges into apathy. It's never a one-note or two-note performance, though it easily could have been.

If the producers had committed to making this an artistic, classic gothic tale, and incorporated more of the ""hero's journey"" structure, this could have become an enduring, five-star, must-see movie.

Fans of Daniel Radcliffe will be impressed with the subtleties of his performance. And, it's still a good movie, if you're a fan of gothic tales or horror films.  But, it falls short of being a success for either audience.

Get the DVD and make sure to see the movie with the commentary on, to get the most from this. The special features on the DVD make a world of difference. If I were to see just the film itself, this would have been a three-star review, at best.",1388620800,3,3962,4.71656976744186
4763503,2,B005LAIGOQ,"I haven't read the short story upon which it is based, but it was too much a rip-off/too derivative of Japanese horror. Except for time and place, the opening scene was almost identical to The Suicide Club. I always dislike Japanese ghost stories because they're so hopeless - although they can be effective social satire they epitomize Asian fatalism to me - while in Western ghost stories, if the protagonist rights the injustice that's causes the haunting then he's saved (i.e., Ghost Story, The Haunting). In most American ghost stories good old Western individualism and ingenuity save the day - the protagonist isn't just hung out to dry by forces beyond his control while the viewer is subjected to the protagonist being terrorized and tortured for 2 hours. The ending was just such a Ring-like bummer, although the concept of being reunited with your family seems nice.

For me one too many ""riviting door opening"" scenes.  It doesn't really resolve, either.

I don't think the British like children very much.  Seems a kid in a Brit film has as bright a future as a red shirt on Star Trek.

The advertisement warns not to view it alone, but nothing could be farther from the truth.  The plot, although predictable, is good if you can get by seeing ""Harry Potter"" where Daniel Radcliffe is concerned.  The scenes were shot in very dreary locations and the house is absolutely perfect for conveying the environment needed for the plot to succeed.  All of the actors were quite convincing in their respective rolls which added to the films suspense.

It seemed like all the work the main character went through, the whole movie, to try to reconcile the old haunt, believing he understood the rules, was for naught.

Good old fashioned haunted house ghost story, like they don't make many anymore! I've always liked Danial Racliffe, whether he's Harry Potter, or the grown to a man actor he is now. There's a vulnerability to his performances which makes his roles like this very believable.

""The Woman In Black"" delivers through in a steady build up of story. Beautiful cinematography which adds to the thick foggy atmosphere of dread & bewilderment. A fine soundtrack that is there for all the right moments, & a impeccable cast of English actors. Here you have a movie that delivers what it promises, fear of the unknown, tickling & prickling the hairs on the back of your neck, just enough to get under the skin.",1382832000,,719,4.698412698412699

A very mature Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, an attorney hired to go through paperwork at a dark, gothic, lonely mansion, with its own cemetery, out in the swamplands of England.  The only road to this home is flooded regularly, so Arthur is at the mercy of the  tides.  The time is the early 1900s, and the only means of lighting are candles & oil lamps which help set the mood.  The movie sets your nerves on edge with perfectly filmed movements behind Arthur who is completely focused on his job.  It is frightening when the fur on the back of the dog's neck raises and he begins to growl at movement down the hall.  I definitely recommend watching this in the dark...but not alone!",1382745600,,796,4.486111111111111

4763681,5,B005LAIGOQ,I thought this was excellent.  Total out from Harry Potter for Dan Radcliffe and the other actors did an excellent job in this film.,1381968000,,132,4.5
4763742,2,B005LAIGOQ,"The Woman in Black stars Daniel Radcliffe (handling his own pretty well in his first post-Harry Potter role) as Arthur Kipps, a struggling lawyer in the United Kingdom's Edwardian era who lost his beloved wife during childbirth and has never quite gotten over it. Arthur is on the verge of being fired by his law firm but is given one last chance to keep his job. The assignment should be simple enough - just travel to far-away and remote Eel Marsh and handle the estate of its recently deceased owner. However, as you might expect, not long after Arthur arrives at the home, he starts hearing things, inanimate objects inexplicably start coming to life inside the house, and he sees a creepy woman in black roaming around the grounds. Oh, and did I mention that the children in the nearby town also start dying all around him at an alarming rate and it may be at the hands of the ghostly woman in black?

It is very rare for modern mainstream horror movies to depict children dying or being murdered, and I applaud The Woman in Black for being so bold as to kill off young kids in some interesting and horrific ways. I cherish the 1980 classic The Children so much because it is one of the only horror movies I know of that goes balls to the wall and kills several little children in some of the goriest and most humorous ways imaginable. Don't worry, though, unlike the children in The Woman in Black, the kids in The Children were monstrous zombies and they had it coming. But I digress.

Hardcore horror movie fans such as myself will not find The Woman in Black scary at all, but young teenagers and fans of Daniel Radcliff's Harry Potter may be sufficiently creeped out and find themselves jumping at a few points during this movie when the obligatory and garden variety non-threatening things such as birds, dogs, or townsmen jump out at our main character and make noise at the most inopportune moments. The theater my husband and I saw this movie in was packed to the gills with young kids and teenagers and I had to endure countless screams and awkward laughs during the ""scary"" parts of this movie.

Hardcore horror movie fans will find a few things to enjoy in this movie, though. The film looks amazing and is beautifully shot, and the opening scene, involving a group of young girls who suddenly jump out of their attic window and plummet to their death, is haunting. The marsh, the woman in black, and the ghosts of her deceased victims also provide for a nice and eerie ambiance. It seems like more than a few movies released over the last year have employed a haunted house theme and the use of ghostly old women with evil intentions. Insidious did it flawlessly, while The Inn Keepers failed miserably. The Woman in Black, however, does a decent job in presenting a scary and ominous woman in black.

You'll also love the wealthy landowner named Sam Daily (played by Ciarn Hinds) and his eccentric and possessed wife (played by Janet McTeer) who befriend Arthur and inform him of the history of the town and the woman in black. There is one particular scene where Arthur has dinner with Mr. and Ms. Daily and learns of their son's tragic death that is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time, and I would have liked to have seen a lot more of this couple. I also would have liked it if the movie went on about 10 minutes longer than it did so we could have seen what became of the couple and their son who was taken from them too soon. I genuinely liked these people and would have liked for them to have found some closure or been reunited with the ghost of their long lost son. The movie would have been better if it had a little bit less of a confused Arthur walking up and down long hallways with a candle and a little bit more of the Daily family.

This movie definitely isn't even close to perfect, and there are a few holes in the plot (e.g., Arthur's sidekick dog initially barks loudly at a few unseen ghosts in the house, but then completely disappears when the shit really starts to hit the fan, only to miraculously reappear in Arthur's car when it is time to flee the scene). However, overall The Woman in Black is a beautifully shot and well-acted little haunted house movie.",1381708800,,4215,4.490221642764015

Some change is inevitable in an adaptation, but the changes here stray too far from the original. Also, the changes don't add anything of value to the story, rather they detract. The end result is melodramatic and clichd. It relies on dreariness, hostility, sadness, and various shades of grief (some mildly insane) to create an ambiance, but it misses the mark. Some of the clichs, like the derelict abandoned house, simply don't make sense (Mrs Drablow was living there until very recently; the house might be terribly shabby but it would still be livable). Even if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't rate this film higher. There's worse out there, but this film is neither atmospheric nor scary.

""The Woman in Black"" practically oozes creepy, gothic, sinister ambience with its macabre mansion and fogbound countryside and cemetery.

The story was decent, and the ending was surprisingly poignant (I was expecting much more of a frightful climax rather than what actually transpired). Had the plot been more solid I would have given higher marks here ... the three stars are strictly for the ghastly trappings, which I enjoy; for more of that stuff, see ""The Haunting"" (1963), ""The Changeling"", and ""The Others"".",1376006400,5,676,5.317757009345795
4763827,3,B005LAIGOQ,"The Arthur Kipps with whom I was hitherto more familiar is the English character by H.G. Wells, who later inspired the musical, ""Half a Sixpence"".
 This one, played by a haunted yet stoic Daniel Radcliffe with relatively few lines and whose large, photogenic blue eyes are as wide as they were in the first ""Harry Potter"" film, is the creation of novelist Susan Hill, and also English.
  Performing in this 95-minute horror flick, which in some ways is not too much of a stretch for him, the former child star, rocking a pair of sideburns along with his short but athletic build, plays an Edwardian era  widower with a small son(Radcliffe's  sweet little real-life godson, Mischa Handley), and sometimes seems eager, at times overly eager, to proclaim his maturity to the world. The short, pert chin of that still adorably pinchable boyish face, which once buttressed baby-fat-filled cheeks as it lifted in awe to inspect a golden snitch is now stubble ridden as it inspects grimmer haunted surroundings. Certain camera shots seem to echo and overly emphasize the message, ""I'm an adult now, and I have the body hair to prove it!""
  The tale begins with the inexplicable demise of the three Fisher Sisters(Emma Shorey, Molly Harmon,and Ellisa Walker-Reid), who suddenly, under mysterious possession, leave off from playing Tea Party with their dolls and jump to their deaths from the attic windows of their parents' inn amid the audible screams of their mother.
  Meanwhile in London, Kipps, a struggling  young attorney is sent to the costal area by train to settle a deceased client's estate, called Eel Marsh House where a vengeful veiled spirit haunts him  as it does the villagers, whose children also become possessed and engage in suicidal acts despite Kipps' frequent and futile attempts to save them. It is of some significance that his four-year-old has  drawn for him, a little calendar, marking the days leading to their scheduled Friday reunion.
  His most relevant acquaintance at this time is the prominent citizen, Sam Daily(Ciaran Hinds, who appeared with Radcliffe in the last two ""Harry Potter"" films), and his disturbed wife, Elizabeth(Janet McTeer)who still grieves the loss of their son, Nicholas(Sidney Johnston), who would have been the same age as Kipps had he lived.
  As the story continues, the young lawyer experiences a mounting level of social  castigation from the locals and is also haunted by a beautiful and benevolent woman in white, namely the spirit of his late wife(Sophie Stuckey) who died in childbirth.
  Scenes of him sifting through the correspondence that help him investigate the case with the malevolent spirit lurking about reminded me of  part of the following poem, ""Antigonish"" by William Hughes Mearns:""Yesterday, upon the stair, I saw a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away.""
  The apparition of this woman( Liz White) who won't go away is later joined by the phantoms of her many young victims. But after gaining in-depth knowledge of the situation, Arthur, with Mr. Daily's help, literally gets down and dirty to bring resolution to the previously unsolved matter. But the spirit remains unforgiving, and she will restore everything Arthur holds dear to him in her own cruel way, creating a very poignant ending.
  I can't say I found this horror flick to be too scary at all, really. But Radcliffe's personal charm carries the story, and Director James Watkins provides another showcase for its young star's fabulous talent.",1376006400,,3522,5.043177892918825

The only draw back I see with this movie is that the story is not so engrossing that I'd want to watch it again. The interest rests more on suspense than any actual character development. It manages to be well acted while delivering a very superficial level of depth to any character, preventing any real emotional investment in what happens to them.

4763899,2,B005LAIGOQ,"It was nice to see Daniel Radcliffe, honestly a fine actor, land this dark role, and in a few instances the brooding interiors and misty landscapes did make for appealing eye candy, but it's an unfortunate commentary on The Woman in Black to point out that those were the best parts of the film. Toned down a few degrees this might have worked well enough in the classical sense as an English country house ghost story, but as heavy-handed as the movie wound up being, it suffocated under the weight of its own lurid efforts to frighten. I will not swing all the way into the camp of those who call this a bad film, because it isn't, it's merely a mediocre one that fell victim to its own ambition to be great. If you're curious about The Woman in Black, rent it, don't buy it, because I can't imagine you'll find much in it that compels repeat viewing.

Let me put it this way...

4763901,3,B005LAIGOQ,"The Woman In Black is a disappointing horror/mystery film mainly for reasons that surround the confusing storyline.

Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame stars as a man who visits a castle out in the countryside for a few days.  The first thing that surprises me is how much older he's gotten.  Yes he's definitely reached the age appropriate to be a father now, rather shockingly.  Seems just like yesterday Sorcerer's Stone came out and I was enjoying it after high school graduation.

Anyway the biggest problem is that, well a combination of two things- weak, overblown writing that makes the entire movie seem artificial and too Hollywood, and despite a solid 15 minutes of actual hauntings *finally* taking place 50 minutes into the movie, overall the Woman in Black just isn't scary or interesting enough.

Perhaps Daniel himself starring in a movie like this is the Woman In Black's biggest downfall.  Most of us are familiar with the Harry Potter films and know what kind of magical creativity was used to make those films so rewarding and provide an unbelievable amount of eye candy using all the special effects you can imagine, but here... well, it's almost like it *tries* to recapture the same concept using horror elements but never succeeding in the same way so the movie ends up looking more like a weak imitation.  Also, a storyline that never really gets off the ground until it's too late pretty much holds down all the potential this movie could have had.

Had to laugh when Harry walked into a room frightened and jumps when mud comes squirting out of a nearby bathtub.  Come on Harry, you just seen horrific otherworldly monsters- a little bit of mud during uneasy atmospheric conditions shouldn't hold YOU of all people back from proceeding!

Oh, about those 15 minutes I mention above that is actually *good*.  This is when Harry, er, Daniel Radcliffe sees a rocking chair rocking by itself, apparitions walking down the hallways, apparitions roaming outside the castle, figures appearing in reflections and mirrors, shadows darting across the room, children lighting themselves on fire, toys making noises by themselves, etc.  This is REALLY excellent stuff however it all goes away due to the movie trying to tell a story involving the death of three children that jump out the window under mysterious circumstances.  I spent more time confused than I did satisfied.

The Woman in Black is clearly more appropriate for Harry Potter fans instead of horror lovers.  With that said, it's not bad by any means.  Basically the first half is disappointing and the second half improves in the atmosphere and horror categories, but fails in the storyline for the most part.  I like the ending involving a fast moving train, though.  I know what you're thinking- no, Daniel does *not* fly a car into the world of wizardry with Ron Weasley. :)",1372291200,,2861,4.898340248962656

4763975,5,B005LAIGOQ,"This film is up with the likes of ""The Uninvited"" (1941) and ""The Innocents"" (1963), as far as being a classic, slow-hand-on-the-shoulder ghost story.  None of the blam!-out-of-the-blue crap like you see in Hollywood films, this is beautiful, dark, foreboding, and in the theater I giggled with delight as the audience reacted to it, even applauding at the end.",1371081600,,361,5.11864406779661
4763976,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Is there another movie genre as maligned as horor? I don't think so. From gratuitous gore fests, silly slasher cesspools and remakes that rarely live up to the originals, Hollywood and even indie film directors have had their way with horror and they all too frequently don't deliver. Some directors even try REALLY hard, and offer up plot twists to make up for other shortcomings, and while I do enjoy a surprising plot element I didn't see coming, having seen so many horror films, I usually am not surprised as the filmmakers intended.

Enter The Woman In Black. Right from the first moment, you know that this isn't going to be your run of the mill, disappointing, predictable scare vehicle. In fact, if you DO go into this one trying to find some evidence that you're about to discover some crazy secret as a plot twist, you will be disappointed. Radcliffe's character isn't one of the boys the woman did away with, back for some purpose or any other devious possible surprise. No, the filmmakers decided that a simple, straight up story about a ghost imposing vengeance to the rest of the town's children after losing her boy was just the right amount of motivation they needed to inspire enough scares from the creepy old gothic house and surrounding area.

There are similarities to other ghost type stories such as the point when in order to hopefully put the woman to rest, he goes into a swamp/marsh to retrieve her boy's body to put with the woman in her coffin, highly reminiscent of 'The Ring' well sequence, but ultimately, similarities don't matter. There are enough genuine bone chilling moments to fluff the hair on the back of your neck for two movies, and the acting from all actors is far above the norm usually seen for horror films. As for Radcliffe and whether he's got the acting chops to move past Harry Potter and into more adult roles, rest assured he can. He himself is left to carry much of the weight of the movie on his shoulders for long periods of time alone, save for the woman and some of the ghosts of her victims keeping him company, and he does it brilliantly and believably.

I also particularly like that the filmmakers were not afraid to rebel against tying everything up into a neat little package where everyone is ok at the end, and they also left it without a real 'hey there's gonna be a sequel' moment as well. Oh sure, they could do another one, but the way the film ends, it can more than stand alone on its' own merit, and I for one hope it does. This film was so good, I wouldn't want to see a hacked up rehashed sequel with extra explanations etc, etc. Sometimes, as in this case, the one film is enough.

So, If you're sick and tired of the same horror song being played again for the umpteenth time and want a throwback to great old ghost stories, The Woman In Black is for you.",1370736000,,2833,4.495145631067961

4764069,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I picked up this DVD on a whim and watched it late at night...which turned out to be a mistake.  Normally, scary movies don't bother me, but this one actually spooked me a bit.  It can be slow at times, but I think the slow pace actually lets the creepiness of the scenes get inside you.

A lawyer is sent off to a run-down house on the edge of a marsh in order to go through the papers left there, leaving his young son at home.  This is his last shot at working out at the firm, due to his clear depression over the death of his wife in childbirth years ago.  Once he gets there, the townsfolk try desperately to send him right back to London and warn him not to go out to Eel Marsh House.  But, of course, he does...

The Woman in Black turns out to be a ghost with murderous tendencies and Daniel Radcliffe's character tries desperately to deal with fulfilling his charge as well as figuring out why she is haunting the place, and attacking the children of the village.  It was hard at first to see past ""Harry Potter,"" but as the movie continued, the acting won me over.

The house itself, filled with Victorian oddities and old paintings, and the lonely marsh its set in provide a spooky landscape for the story.  When the tides roll in, the place is cut off entirely from the mainland and this makes the setting even more frightening.  Its very Gothic, but with enough touches of modern horror to engage a modern audience.

I'll definitely be watching it again, but not late at night, this time.",1364774400,,1502,4.325

It kind of ruined the whole movie for me. This movie is worth watching, but I will never watch it again.",1359849600,,481,4.415730337078652
4764275,3,B005LAIGOQ,"I guess I had higher expectations for this movie. I found it a little dull. It had the creepy factor, which I liked, but I found my attention wandering during the movie. The ending was a bit of a stretch.",1359676800,,204,4.125
4764276,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Daniel Radcliffe readily engages his first post-Harry Potter lead role in this suitably spooky, nicely atmospheric ghost story.  Those looking for a good story, rather than senseless gore, will be satisfied I think.",1359590400,,215,5.515151515151516
4764277,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Hammer Horror returns in full force in the 2012 film adaptation of THE WOMAN IN BLACK, starring Daniel Radcliffe. A lowly young lawyer is sent to prepare the sale of a grand old estate, the Eel Marsh House, but unbeknownst to him, the house carries with it an ominous curse that has been plaguing the children of the small town for years. After settling in, Arthur begins experiencing horrific visions as the ghosts of the past return to haunt him! THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an excellent revival of the Gothic tradition that echoes the works of Jack Clayton and Alejandro Amenbar in their retellings of the classic novella, The Turn of the Screw. A constant sense of dread befalls the viewer as we are drowned in mists and shadows. Director James Watkins takes a timely approach to storytelling of his own which pays off entirely, and allows for many long, drawn out sequences to incrementally heighten the tension and suspense as we await the final shock in the end. THE WOMAN IN BLACK also focuses heavily on eerie effects which can be achieved in frame rather than destroying the fantasy through computerized scares. Daniel Radcliffe is amply equipped for the role as the grieving lawyer Arthur Kipps, and plays perfectly in to the Edwardian setting. One can only hope that this will continue to spark more ghostly haunts in the terrifying tradition of the Hammer House of Horror.

The scariest part of the movie, if you ask me, is the very ending when the Woman in Black looks right at you.  I look forward to seeing more from Daniel.",1358899200,,440,4.141176470588236
4764322,4,B005LAIGOQ,"This is finely told horror story, set in last century's rural English countryside.  Daniel Redcliff plays a young attorney Arthur, a widower for several years after his wife dies giving birth to their first child Joseph.  His love for his wife was so strong that even time does not seem to be able to erase his memory of her.  It is as if the more time passes by, the more he misses her.  It is the young boy that keeps him going.

Arthur's employer is loosing patience with Arthur's melancholy mood that shows so well on screen with Redcliffe's dark hair and his pale, pale skin.  It is as if young attorney's sorrow is bad for business and only if young Arthur can close sale on the house of the recently deceased client, he can resurrect his career.  So the story begins.  Arthur finds himself in a remote village where everyone seems less than thrilled to see him.  With his arrival to the village, children die mysteriously in the most gruesome deaths unbecoming of their innocent lives.  Arthur is deeply affected with the experiences since he has a child himself.  So the story turns the ghost story of horror of sort.  A deceased mother separted from her child who also died (but without a proper burial) is reliesing her vengeance.  But what striked me in this film is the way she expressed her gratitude to Arthur once Arthur reunites her with her dead son.  The end of the movie made me cry.  I was both happy and sad and I just broke down.",1358899200,,1451,4.4638783269961975

4764328,2,B005LAIGOQ,"For years I've been trying to get my hands on a copy of the 1989 made-for-TV version of The Woman in Black, which is both very expensive and very difficult to find on DVD, so when I heard that they were making another film version, I was initially excited to finally have the opportunity to see a version of The Woman in Black on film.  I was, however, also concerned that there would be changes to the plot and deviations from the original novel that would serve to ""Hollywoodify"" the story.  After watching this new version with Daniel Radcliffe, I can say that my fears were confirmed.  There were numerous changes to the story that took it in some wildly different directions than what the author Susan Hill probably intended, and these changes did not improve the story.  One of the best things about the novel is its restraint.  It is heavy on atmosphere and psychological tension and light on the stuff of typical horror stories, i.e. dead bodies, blood and guts, psycho behavior, possessed people, etc.  While this film does retain the spooky and ominous atmosphere present in the novel, there were so many changes to story that I often thought I was seeing a completely different story.

The novel begins with Arthur Kipps as an older, remarried man recounting the story of his dealings with the Woman in Black and how they led to the deaths of his first wife and young son when he was a young man working at a law firm.  His first encounter with the Woman in Black occurs at Alice Drablow's funeral.  He is sent there as a representative of the law firm and initially thinks the Woman in Black is a mourner.  I was really hoping to see this scene dramatized, but the film completely changes the sequence of events in the novel and adds a bunch of stuff that didn't need to be there.  The two biggest changes that I absolutely could not get past were the scenes where Arthur Kipps and Samuel Daily (Ciarn Hinds) manage to pull the sunken carriage containing the body of Jennet Humfrye's (The Woman in Black's) son out of the marshes (like they would really be able to do this), then take the child's corpse back to Eel Marsh house in an attempt to reunite Jennet Humfrye and her son (this never happens in the book and is completely unbelievable), and of course the corny ending where Arthur Kipps and his son are killed by an oncoming train after the son is lured onto the tracks by the Woman in Black, then they are both reunited with Arthur Kipps' dead wife at the very end in the afterlife as they walk away together into the mists.  This was the Hollywood shocker ending that I was afraid this film would receive.  In the novel, Arthur Kipps' wife and son are killed by the Woman in Black, but Arthur remains alive (because somebody has to tell the story!), and their deaths do not involve a train.  The ending of the novel is shocking, but there is no reuniting with anybody in the afterlife.  My mother and I both watched this film together and when it was over, my mother said to me, ""It could have been so much more than it was.""  And I agreed.",1357948800,31,3062,4.460573476702509

The setting of Hill's story fairly oozes with atmosphere, and the film captures the creepy yet romantic vibe really well. Radcliffe is near perfect in the lead role as a grieving widower and young father.  On a side note, I was disappointed with the way the screenplay departs from the novel in places, especially at the end, but this is still a film I will revisit as it is high caliber movie-making and I adore the setting and drama the film presents.  I also highly recommend reading Hill's original novel--one of the top gothic literary works in my book...",1357776000,,672,4.686440677966102

Like The Others and The Orphanage of these modern day films , The Woman in Black serves up a well crafted take on the haunted house with Daniel Radcliffe lifting this movie up to a Hammer film worthy of its past works.  Its not great by any means but its well worth checking out, the eerie settings, the dilapidated house and the exceptional cinematograpy are especially well done and add in some chilling scenes with the dead children and the lady in black and a twised ending leaves you uneasy. There are a few stand out performances from a local sympathetic couple and  local towns people who want only to get rid of the intruder in their mist.

  Directed by James Watkins. Written by Jane Goldman.

Remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-in-Black-VHS/dp/6302925525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman in Black [VHS</a>] (1989).

 Three girls (Emma Storey, Molly Harmon, Ellisa Walker-Reid) are playing dolls and tea during the daytime in the attic. Suddenly, they all look at the windows and at the same time, in a trance, they walk to the windows and open them and fall to their death. A woman dressed in black funeral clothes is seen in the room.
  Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) works for a law firm. He must leave his son, Joseph (Misha Handley) and the nanny (Jessica Raine) for a few days to go to the countryside.
 Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House died last month. He must go to the estate in the marshlands to go through much paperwork to find her final will. Every page must be examined. A Mr. Jerome (Tim McMullan) is not cooperating. Arthur's boss, Mr. Bentley (Roger Allam) tells him he must prove his dedication to the future of this law firm. It is his final warning. Arthur's bills at home are overdue.
  Aboard the train, Arthur meets Samuel Daily (Ciaran Hinds) who offers to drive him to the Gifford Arms Inn. It is raining hard. At the inn, Mr. Fisher, the innkeeper (Shaun Dooley), doesn't care for Arthur having a reservation and tells him he has no room for him. However, with the agreement of his wife, Mrs. Fisher (Mary Stuckley), he can stay in the attic. Yes! That very attic.
  The next day, he arrives at the old Drablow estate. Inside it is very dusty and with huge cobwebs. While going through the papers during the daytime, he hears the floorboards, maybe footprints and other sounds. He goes upstairs to see what it is (I'm not telling). Outside the fog is coming in heavily. In the woods, he sees a woman in black.

  Also in the cast: Cathy Sara, Daniel Cerqueira, Alfie Field, Janet McTeer, Victor McGuire, Roger Allam.
  Liz White played ""The Woman in Black"".
  Misha Handley (""Joseph"") is Daniel Radcliffe's real-life godson.

Filmed at Cotterstock Hall, Oundle, Northamptonshire, England. Osea island, Essex, North Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom. Pinewood Studios.

 This movie, starring Daniel Radcliffe, held my attention and while I am getting used to the use of CGI effects, the scary elements do not work so well for me on television and probably worked better for the big screen.
 I did want to see this movie originally at the movie theater, but was unable too.

  This was the first movie Daniel Radcliffe filmed after the ""Harry Potter"" film series concluded with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Part-2-Blu-ray-DVD-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy/dp/B001UV4XJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;(2011).

  If Daniel Radcliffe had not been cast in the lead of The Woman in Black (2012) I probably would not have seen it. It is a good role and motion picture for him.

 A familiar name is tied to this film...HAMMER, who have been a production company of many thrillers in the past.

4764515,3,B005LAIGOQ,"Set in the Edwardian-era England, ""The Woman in Black"" is an old-fashioned horror movie that reminds us of Victorian ghost stories. This is not surprising, as the film (based on a Susan Hill novel) is produced by the newly revived Hammer studio, once known for its ""Dracula"" franchise starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.

Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer on the verge of losing his position in the firm. As a final chance to keep his job, he is sent to a small British town, where he has to find a certain document at the Eel Marsh House on an estate that is cut off from the outside world. The people there obviously do not want him in their town, however. The local lawyer is not cooperative. Soon Arthur is to learn the reason - some terrifying things about ""The Woman in Black.""

The 2012 film version of ""The Woman in Black"" (the original book was made into a TV movie starring Adrian Rawlins as Arthur Kipps in 1989) benefits from the atmospheric photography and the production designs of the desolate Eel Marsh House that alone is worth watching. Daniel Radcliffe turns in effective performance a widowed father, still mourning his wife's death, though he looks a little too young for the role of a father, if not a lawyer.

What the film doesn't have is any new ideas to scare us. As to the film's scares, the best part is probably the ""Ju-On""-inspired opening, which is creepy enough, but the film itself nds to depend on the hackneyed techniques like sudden big sound. Some of them are so predictable that you can see them coming from miles away.

Perhaps we have seen so many similar-themed thrillers since the original book was published, ""The Orphanage"" for example, films with more inventive and creative ways to surprise and scare us. Had it been made much earlier (by ten years or more), ""The Woman in Black"" would have been a more scary movie.",1354665600,,1884,4.631736526946108

4764578,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Woman in Black is a pretty 'traditional' kind of horror flick that combines all the elements of horror (startling sounds, dark creepy houses, lonely location, etc.). What I liked the most is the photography and overall texture of the movie. Its BEAUTIFUL! the climate, the details in the interiors have been captured so well, it will please your eyes. The element of horror is not very different other movies, so this one will have average score when it comes to scaring you. However, the story is believable, nicely flowing and is worth the watch on a rainy day/night (may be that will scare you bit more). Most important part is, there is no gore, no bloodshed and no unnecessary screaming. Considering all these factors, this horror goes more in the line with ""the ring"", ""insidious""  and such movies (though the plot is entirely different).
Overall scoring:
Plot, story: Pretty traditional, but nice.
Photograpy, location: BRILLIANT!
Element of horror: Average (or slightly above it)

Ghost stories are not my thing. They give me the creeps, and not in a way I'd like to repeat. So my feelings about this one are mixed. From a purely writing and artistic perspective, this movie is magnificent. It builds suspense quietly and then unleashes visual horrors on a nervous audience. The cast is terrific... Radcliffe proves that he can tackle far more adult, period pieces than his famous wizard counterpart. Janet McTeer turns up as the tormented wife of Mr. Daily, suffering from visitations from her dead son. The costuming, musical score, and setting are marvelous... it blends into a chilling state of events that range from doors that open and close by themselves to  the shocking conclusion that is both beautiful and tragic. I'm also happy to say that the movie can stand on its own two feet -- it doesn't need its famous lead to succeed, although it is a joy to have him there.

4764730,5,B005LAIGOQ,"`The Woman in Black' is pretty much a classic ghost story; lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is tasked with travelling to a small, tight-knit community to handle the estate of a wealthy woman who is now deceased. But while it's obvious his presence isn't welcomed, Kipps makes for the woman's isolated house and finds he has to deal with something a lot more sinister than paperwork, and in order to stop anymore innocent lives from being taken - and, perhaps, to save his remaining clean underwear - he needs to face a dark secret that the town is hiding.

It maybe a familiar set-up, but `The Woman in Black' is still a well-shot, spooky ride. Director James Watkins pulls out old tricks to scare us, but it works brilliantly as he keeps the whole film in a slow, tense, unnerving atmosphere. The story is shrouded in mystery, as they always should be in these films, and Watkins strings us along by handing out little clues throughout and the scares come more from the build-up, which keeps you on edge, and it really helps on the delivery. Daniel Radcliffe also proves he can shrug off the-boy-who-lived and, although a little young for the role, puts in a generally solid and emotional performance as Arthur Kipps. If you let it take you along for the ride, `The Woman in Black' is worth the watch, every ninety-five creepy minutes of it.",1352160000,,1348,4.663865546218488

As you can see the acting in this movie is really good and it pulls you in.  Even though the movie is good it isn't super scary.  It does enough to keep you on the edge of your seat anticipating what is going to happen next.  I really enjoyed this movie and believe that if you like movies with a dark, creepy, and gothic vibe to them you will like this movie also.  Plus this movie does not use gore to try and scare you, its more sounds and shadows and brief encounters with the ghost.  I give this movie a solid B.",1352160000,,758,3.9084967320261437

It's hard to say why this movie just does not entertain ........ it is visually rich - great sets, locations, wardrobe, etc ........ the actors all do well with their lines and all the characters are believable.  BUT the movie just NEVER draws the viewer into it.  All the ""scary parts"" rely on standard formulas - something moving in the background (that the hero never sees until it's too late) or something popping up suddenly (BOO!).

It is just totally flat - one note - no depth at all.  Maybe the book was more engaging - I hope so.  The ending is disappointing and predictable.

Also, I did jump, and I even squealed a couple of times, hanging on to my husband's arm for dear life.  Remember, I'm a horror movie buff.  Even movies that make me jump NEVER make me scream, but I found the images truly frightening.

4764735,2,B005LAIGOQ,"Arthur Kipps is a lawyer in London whose wife has died in childbirth.  He has a four year old son and a nanny for him. However, he is in danger of losing his job at his law firm because apparently he has done nothing but mope around for the last four years. He is given one last chance to redeem himself, to go to a remote village and Eel Marsh House, where the owner has died, and sort out her many papers.

He meets a man, Samuel Daily, on the train on the way there, and despite Arthur's very rarely opening his mouth to speak (ever), Samuel becomes his one ally in the town.  Arthur goes to Eel Marsh house to look for, and at the papers of this woman, and get them in order and locate her will.  How he is expected to do this, I do not understand, because even in the daylight, with candles, that place is dark as a cave.

The important papers (birth and death certificates, adoption papers) are placed conveniently on top so that Arthur finds out what he needs to know right away - about the ghost, The Woman In Black (what wearing black has to do with anything they don't say). Every time he goes to the house, there is always a lot of unexplained sights and sounds, which never faze Arthur in the least. He's still just so stunned from losing his wife four years ago.

The ghost, Jennet, really does seem to be taking her anger out on the wrong people. After so many deaths, you'd think they'd move away or hire an exorcist or something. As is usual in these movies, what the living person thinks/hopes/believes/is sure will appease the out of control ghost does not work. I didn't really care about any of these silly characters, and watching Arthur go from being covered in mud/dirt/or soaking wet to being dry and spotless wearing the same clothes, was irritating.

Something that perturbed me: on the adoption papers those involved are referred to as Mr., Mrs., and Ms. (the unmarried ghost). But from all the period British novels I've read, there was no use of ""Ms."" back then and periods after honorifics such as Mr, Mrs or Dr were not used, and still are not. Jennet should have been referred to as ""Miss"" on the adoption paper.

Janet McTeer was wasted, but I guess it's a paycheck.",1351468800,2,2199,4.385749385749386

4764809,4,B005LAIGOQ,"The Harry Potter franchise has left such lasting impact that, throughout the viewing of THE WOMAN IN BLACK, I half-expected Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to apparate and lend a hand to their beleaguered old mate. A Hammer Films joint, THE WOMAN IN BLACK makes for elegant British gothic horror. It tells a dark tale of numbing loss and unholy vengeance. It's Daniel Radcliffe's first venture into cinema, post-Potter. And yet he's still dabbling in the supernatural.

Susan Hill's eerie 1983 bestseller had already been adapted as a television mini-series in the 1980s and as a stage play, but the rejuvenated Hammer Film Productions thumbed it up for a go on the silver screen anyway. Daniel Radcliffe, all of 21 years old during the filming, plays widower Arthur Kipps who after four years still grieves for his wife's passing. His inertness has adversely affected his career at a London law firm to the extent that he's a hair's breadth away from getting sacked.

Arthur Kipps gets one last chance to make good. He's dispatched to northeast England, to a remote village in which outskirts looms the creaky Eel Marsh House. In this ruined mansion, ringed by treacherous marshland and accessible only by a causeway, Arthur is to sort out a deceased woman's estate. But since this isn't an episode of SUITS, the spooky very soon emerges.

A curse holds the nearby village in thrall, or not a curse but rather a vindictive spirit. Arthur's arrival is met with instant suspicion from the inhospitable townspeople, most of whom fear what Arthur's meddling may further stir up. Faced with brusqueness at every turn, Arthur Kipps presses on. And while he's so emotionally closed off that he rarely exhibits a reaction to the alarming stuff going on around him, the film does a very good job of jangling our nerves. The scares are of the make-you-jump variety, cheap but very effective and more restrained than garish. THE WOMAN IN BLACK does well in establishing its ghost story ground rules. We find out that the menacing figure that fleetingly graces your peripheral vision - a veiled woman clad in black mourning garb - is targeting children, is forcing them to engage in gruesome self-extermination. So, right there, a measure of tension is lifted. We know Radcliffe's character is moderately safe. And there isn't a child prominently featured in the film for whom we have a rooting investment. Arthur's young boy Joseph (played by 4-year-old Misha Handley, Radcliffe's godson in real life) is barely in it.

Set in the Edwardian era (thus placing this story somewhen between 1901 - 1910), the film's biggest ace is the marvelously ominous set design of the Eel Marsh House. It's one of the spookiest haunted houses seen onscreen in recent years. As ever, in the auspices of a ghost story, children's toys very much become these creepy artifacts. I thought Radcliffe does okay. He plays a repressed widower and you may wonder why he doesn't panic more or just plain clear out when that empty rocking chair starts rocking or disembodied footsteps are heard or that distant window pane reveals a spectral woman gazing out. I think Arthur Kipps sees these unsettling events in another way, sees them as evidence of an afterlife in which he can reunite with his dead wife. One gets the sense that he deliberately seeks out the unrestful spirit. It's up to you whether this undertone exists and if it's communicated by Radcliffe's rather reserved performance. Also, with high tide closing off the causeway, where was he gonna go?

THE WOMAN IN BLACK is rich in atmosphere and broodingly gothic. It's a restrained but effective chiller. Certain moments made me clutch the armrest. Perhaps one knock is that while it does maintain a thread of steady suspense, I think it fails in delivering that big payoff. It falls short of that epic grand guignol. It's touted as the most successful British horror picture in two decades, and so were you at all startled when Hammer Films announced a sequel, the story set to take place during World War II?

4764812,4,B005LAIGOQ,"A was blindsided with brilliance as I watched The Woman In Black. The cover art and title lent itself to a run of the mill ghost story that may be tolerable. And guess what? It is a fairly typical ghost story, but the film is presented with such rich grounding atmosphere and tight acting that the old fashioned haunted house story is revived without loss.

The blu- ray disc is solid and takes the viewer into the perfectly replicated misty past of the Old English countryside. I had no problem getting past any Harry Potter shortcomings that viewers may have unfairly dwelled on. This man can act, and he pulled out all the necessary emotions especially holding to an often sullen demeanor.

The film digs deep into haunted house history with creaky doors, spooky structures and amplifies it with modern film-making to create the epitome of the traditional haunted house. The ghostly figure of a female evil spirit lurks and she delivers real spine tinglers. Quietness becomes the enemy as the house has a creep fest around every corner.

Great evoking of British mannerisms and phraseology abound. The film stresses aura inducing scenery while you wait for the outcome to unfold. It looks like good old Hammer films are making a comeback as the films opening provides the said logo. It's great to see a ghost story, that really is a ghost story.

4764860,4,B005LAIGOQ,"When the movie starts the first thing that I notice is the logo for the new Hammer film productions. Hammer studios, if you do know, were a British film company that in the 40's and 50's specialized in film noir, science fiction and other modest genre pictures, but there great success and ultimate legacy would be built upon there gothic horror tales that they made in the late 50's through the mid-70's. Helping to cement the careers of stars such as Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Oliver Reed, Herbert Lom, Michael Gough, Hazel Court, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Shelley, and directors Terence Fisher and Freddie Francis. Like the revived Eailing studios (droll British comedy) and Amicus films (anthology horror movies), the names alone have returned in an attempt to reclaim some of the past glories by using a signature still half heartily remembered by fans of movies of yesteryear, happily Hammer is still leading the way in quality fright films.

The Woman in Black is the most overt return to their gothic roots, telling a ghost story that lives in the morbid tell tale hearts and fractured minds of misguided youths from days of ole. In other words, this is my terrain, these are the scary stories we are told around camp fires or experience on a Saturday matinee television show, before we would find the more graphic shockers of late night. It's a return to innocence, while letting the goose flesh crawl up on our arms.

Set in the Edwardian era and starring former Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe, here making a fine transition to more mature roles, and Irish character actor Ciaran Hinds, in parts that could easily have been played by Reed and Cushing a few decades back.  Based on Susan Hill's novel, previously filmed for British TV in 1989, with a sequel already in the works. I missed this one in theaters last February, but am grateful that I caught up with it now that it is out on DVD, other than an unnecessary sappy ending, this is good old fashion scary material. Just after seeing the pathetic Apartment 143, here's a scream fest to worm the cockles of my still beating heart.

Thanks to no undue gore or torture here, but there are a few good jolts and a nicely scary atmosphere, plus one of the creepiest, but simple final shots in quiet a long time. This is a nightmare suitable for the whole family, and it's well worth the sleepless night.

Radclift does a great job getting out of the Harry Potter mold.  It's the best haunted house movie I've seen in a very long time.  It serves up the frights with suspense and without the use of constant blood and gore, which is wonderful.  I have the original Haunting (Julie Harris & Claire Bloom) which is good, and have aways thought if the same screen play were used in a remake it could be truely frightening again, given current special effects.

The Woman in Black takes advantage of the current interest in ghost hunting and paranormal programs on TV.  If you aren't interested in the paranormal don't bother seeing this; it isn't a teen slasher movie. Yeah!",1349222400,,783,4.55

4764866,5,B005LAIGOQ,"""The Woman In Black"". Theatrical release: February 2012. It's a horror/thriller movie based on Susan Hill's book of the same title. It is a classical ghost story set in a village in the early Edwardian times (1901-1917) England. It lacks the fast-paced and gory scenes of contemporary horror films which I think is the strength of this motion picture. Although it's James Watkins' (director) second attempt on directing, he succeeded in frightening us and capturing our interest without splashing blood, displaying brutally dismembered bodies, or strong sexual content. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) as the lead, proved to be a successful gamble. Daniel brilliantly portrayed a mature solicitor which is a great departure from the mischievous adolescent Harry Potter we've gotten used to. Beside the evil ghost, the movie also deals with abstract human emotions such as the pain of loosing someone and cooping with the aftermath. So, prepare to be scared with class and eloquence with a hint of tragedy. I also recommend the book as it has a different ending.",1348963200,,1061,5.2105263157894735

It wasn't a bad movie by any stretch, but it fell short of what it could have been. The story centers around a young widowed lawyer who goes to some distant town in Britain to search for a last will and testament of a client of his firm. Problem is that the house in which the papers lie is haunted by a ghost that kills a young child every time it's seen. Let's stop right there: What? Every time the ghost is seen it kills a kid? How does the ghost determine what age is young enough to be a kid? Is a 16-year-old sufficient or does it have to be a pre-teen? I dunno, the whole must kill a kid angle was kinda lame imo. But whatever, the lawyer goes to the house and realizes that the house is an island when the tide comes in as the only road to it is covered in water during those times. Cool premise and it could made for some really scary stuff during the times he was stuck there. As is, the director opted for suspense over scares as almost nothing really happens until the end, and even then nothing really happens. It's not a bad movie, but I was hoping they would go for just a haunted house that someone is trapped in rather than what they did. Still, not a bad flick. Final scene was definitely unnerving, which made up for the horrible ending.",1348358400,,1400,4.131868131868132

People are too used to gore and slashers that they no longer appreciate atmosphere and being spooked by the old fashioned and imaginative.  This is the sort of horror that sticks with you, that chills you to the bone and I think that's why a lot of people don't understand it or don't appreciate it. It's one thing to be made to jump by a serious killer, it's another thing when a horror film reaches you on a deep and personal level.

This is true to form, traditional Hammer horror.  There hasn't been a good, mysterious and haunting film like this since 1999's Sleepy Hollow starring Johnny Depp.  I miss horror films like these and it's a shame that so many people today just don't ""Get"" this type of horror.

Something that disturbs me about some fans of this film are the ones that think The Woman in Black character was doing Arthur a favor at the end. She really, really, wasn't.

4765164,1,B005LAIGOQ,"Having read the book twice, and seen the BBC 1989 movie version several times,I was entertaining high hopes with this new version of one of my favorite Gothic-horror stories. I was hoping that a more generous budget would do full honors to this little jewel of  the Gothic-horror genre. Although the 1989 version proved that intelligent choices in directing can overcome many obstacles, including a low budget. On the other hand I also was a little fearful about this movie falling prey to today's curse on horror movies:succumbing to the temptation of drowning the story in computerized, cheap special effects, resulting in tons of cheap-gore and gallons of blood, and Disney-like ghouls and monsters.
As it has been mentioned here by other critics, changing the story a little is not a crucial problem when the essential elements are kept,and respected. The 1989 film version did a few changes, but the story plot was there, and it could be followed at a real pace. The script was intelligent and it worked. But this is another story...
I went to see this new movie at a classic movie house from the 50s,restored and with a big screen. I wanted to do full honors to this new version. But,as the movie progressed,the horrific truth was evident, my worst fears were materializing in front of my eyes. There was no real story-plot to follow. I was in for a Blackberry generation version of The Woman in Black. It was to fast-paced to be nothing but a video-game,the scenes kept moving forward,as if slashed with a machete,unable to create a story line. And finally, when I was confronted with the exaggerated and ridiculous ""house on the marsh"" of this version, I knew I was watching a pathetic blend of 'The Adam's Family meets Stephen King' for the blackberry generation. From there on it was downhill, a movie predictably drowned in unnecessary and exaggerated special effects such as the bleeding-bed, and a woman in black so unsubstantial that it looked more like a Japanese-anime figure running amok the Adam's family house. The end was not only too much of a travesty,but a corny and childish idea,unworthy of Susan Hill's work.
For those unfamiliar with good literature, or a good reading, this 'video-game' version might do. But for those who are familiar with real stories and good scripts, my recommendation is:AVOID this waste of money and time like you would the plague. For me this was THE WASTE OF A GOOD CHANCE...
If you want your intelligence to be respected, stick to the 1989 BBC version. It might be too slow for those whose attention span can not survive anything beyond 60-seconds bytes,or nothing deeper than a video-game plot,but for those able to enjoy true suspense and a good literary build-up of the plot, the story IS THERE,and its good!
If you like classic Gothic horror stories, with well written scripts and literary style, I recommend movies like:
The Changeling,Haunted! The Reincarnation of Peter Proud,The Uninvited,and even The House Where Evil Dwells. And the wonderful literary ghost stories of Japanese films like KWAIDAN and Ugetsu,",1345852800,8,3072,4.93050193050193

4765166,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Ghost stories are quite popular in England, probably because the weather and the winters give an optimal spooky atmosphere. The Woman in Black is just such a ghost story. It was first a novel, then made into a TV movie, a stage play, and two radio dramas before the release of this cinema version (which I saw on DVD).

The story follows Arthur Kipps (played by Daniel Radcliffe), a young, widowed lawyer who has a four-year old son. He is still troubled by the loss of his wife. That has affected his work. The law firm sends him off to the North to settle the estate of Alice Drablow. She lived in Eel Marsh House at the end of Nine Lives Causeway. The causeway is only navigable at low tide. The house is full of paperwork that needs sorting to ensure the law firm's copy of her will is indeed the current one. This is Kipps last chance to prove he is serious about working for the firm. If he does not do well, he will be fired.

He takes a train up to the town of Crynith Gifford. He meets a local man, Samuel Daily, who is quite rich (he owns the only car for miles and miles) and is friendly enough. The rest of the town is not so friendly because of the house's bad history and the local legend of the Woman in Black. She is mostly seen either by the house or on the causeway, but occasionally in town. Whenever she is seen, soon thereafter a child dies. Typically the death is a quite horrible one. Naturally the townfolk don't want anyone around the house. Kipps insists on going (to keep his job). As he researches through the papers, he uncovers information about the Woman in Black. Oh yeah, and strange noises and apparitions start happening too. And his son is supposed to come up on the weekend for a holiday!

The movie centers on Kipps. It follows his investigation of the paperwork just enough to reveal the identity and motives of the Woman in Black. His character is well developed. His motives for staying are sensible enough and he is likeable enough that the viewer actually cares what happens to him. Developing an intelligent, sympathetic main character is critical in this type of movie. Radcliffe gives a great performance, subtle and nuanced without hysterics. He makes it more chilling.

Much of the film shows him wandering through the house trying to look around corners for what just made that noise or what he just saw out of the corner of his eye. Plenty of cobwebs, dark corners, and creepy children's toys are made even more ominous by the low-key but highly evocative score. The atmosphere is great and delivers plenty of goosebumps. The story is interesting enough and the various twists are only occasionally predictable and always effective.

The Woman in Black is a classic example of a haunted house movie, ranking with the best in that genre (The Uninvited, The Haunting, and The Changeling being the best).",1345766400,,2851,4.549707602339181
4765167,4,B005LAIGOQ,"There's a legend around the seaside town of Crythin Gifford of a woman all dressed in black hiding her face beneath a long black veil.  Whenever someone sees her, somewhere in town, a child dies.

When troubled estate attorney Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe of the Harry Potter fame) comes to town to settle the estate of an eccentric client, he has no idea of the hostility the town throws his way.  No one will speak to him except to tell him that it would be wise to leave.  But he is determined to get the job done or else risk losing his job.  While staying at his former client's decrepit mansion cut of from the rest of the world by a marsh, Kipps begins seeing a mysterious woman in black and soon enough, a young girl dies in his arms.  As the sightings of this woman increases, the number of dead children begins to rise and Kipps finds himself in the center of a mystery that has haunted the town over the last forty years; a mystery involving the accidental drowning of a young boy tragically witnessed by the boy's mother whom the townspeople had successfully taken the child from due to their strict moral code simply because he was born out of wedlock.  His mother died in the midst of her grief and that grief turned to revenge.  Now Kipps has three days to uncover the truth behind the legend and bring about a close to the town's curse before his own son becomes the next target for The Woman In Black.

The movie itself was energetic enough to keep you interested and really harken back to the late Brittish horror movies of the 60s and 70s.  The score by Marco Beltrami was creepy and helped added some much needed tension that the movie lacked visually.  But there are a fair amount of problems here.  The jump scares are numerous.  And while Radcliffe is a really good actor, I thought he was miscast.  He looked really to young for the part.  In fact, he looked like he was 18 with badly grown facial hair.  I also loved how the boy in the marsh body was never recovered, yet Kipps was not only able to locate it in record time, the carriage he died in looked as if it had just rolled in yesterday instead of rotting under the water and muck for the last forty years.  But the biggest complaint lies in the ending.  For a movie this grim, I found it a little too happy, a little too Hollywood. It seemed out of place and that pretty much killed it for me.  Even so, I'm still recommending it just on its mystery quality and because it's a simple ghost story that isn't complicated or burden down by too much back story.

4765218,5,B005LAIGOQ,"An old-fashioned ghost story crafted with an eerie-eye reminiscent of classic Hollywood fright films, HAMMER Studio's THE WOMAN IN BLACK is the perfect remedy for those seeking a cure from the usual fare which passes for contemporary horror in today's overwrought shock film industry. Bravely side-stepping modern ""scary movie"" conventions (gratuitous gore; scantily clad teenagers being chased through dense forests by faceless phantoms) the ghostly WOMAN succeeds by playing by its own haunted set of rules which transforms what could have been a mundane endeavor into a skillful and clever take on the haunted house genre which masterfully ratchets-up the thrills until going ""full-ghost"" during it's fright-infested second act.

Daniel Radcliffe gives a stately and refined post-Harry Potter performance as Arthur Kipps, a late-19th-century lawyer coming to terms with the recent loss of his wife when he is summoned to a remote mansion in Victorian-era England to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman's estate. But all is not well in the God-fearing hamlet of Crythin Gifford for upon his arrival, a series of disturbing supernatural events transpire which are revealed to be the violent physical manifestations of a vengeful ghost which is targeting the children of the populace surrounding the (supposedly) uninhabited estate.

Not long after, Kipps decides to investigate further and does so by spending the evening in the foreboding mansion (alone). It is here that the witching hour begins in earnest and the filmmakers get down to business and unleash a chilling maelstrom of terror upon the unnerved Kipps. The house shudders to life and unleashes oppressive energies which take form in the fearsome guise of shapeless apparitions and menacing shadow figures. Musty corridors become unlikely conduits for horrific screams to pierce the mansions tomb-like serenity and disembodied voices whisper evil-sentiments which reverberate throughout its cavernous interiors. Scenes depicting the titular Woman In Black are particularly disturbing and are capable of inducing nightmares amongst those (like me) susceptible to such things.

The production and set design are superlative and combine to create one of the more memorable spooky house environments of recent times: elongated hallways stretch forever into darkness; chandeliers glow diffused hues from beneath blankets of cobwebs; the obligatory grand stairway which creaks and moans with menace and spacious rooms that are adorned with faded photographs of souls long-departed. Additional tech credits are top notch with the cinematography aptly capturing the grim atmosphere and washed-out gloom of the cold and uninviting house; and the nerve-rattling score does it job as it keeps things appropriately sinister by hitting its cues and punctuating key scenes with auditory dread.

Mr. Kipps eventually uncovers the dark motives surrounding the disturbances and the film reaches a spiritual and satisfying conclusion. But in the interest of avoiding spoilers, you will have to seek out the movie yourselves to discover the truth behind the curse which has befallen the town. The Woman In Black is a welcome return to SCARY haunted house storytelling and is tailor-made for viewing on dark and stormy evenings. So put away the Ouija board for a few hours, cozy-up with your favorite malevolent spirit and prepare for a night of fright with this spectral spinster. -Ronnie Jimenez, Pumpkin Patch Gazette",1345507200,,3476,5.5159474671669795

This is especially true for the movie's main villain. It's just an evil thing. Sure it has motivation, but there's no chance for redemption or resolution. The first 90% is good spooky entertainment.

4765222,2,B005LAIGOQ,"Having read Susan Hill's sinister and chilling tale a number of times, I had high hopes for this screen adaptation. And boy did it look good - the opening sequence, where innocent child play quite seamlessly flows into a precisely choreographed triple suicide, seemed promising enough. But from then on, I was sorely let down, or rather, irritated and annoyed with what I forced myself to watch.

It is a valid question whether or not Hill's story has the potential to be made into anything that could satisfy the standards expected by moviegoers of today; while relying mainly on atmosphere and the building effects of oppressive settings/landscapes, the plot is simple, with maybe just too little action to be found. So the temptation to make it ""bigger"" must certainly be there. Now changing a few details isn't necessarily a crime (I did like the parrot!), as long as the original mood and structure is retained - but here's where the filmmakers fall pitifully short. There's no exposition to speak of; the protagonist's life context, i.e., family and work, is rushed through in a couple of seconds. No chance of getting a real sense of place either. The crucial funeral/church scene is dropped and we are plunged almost head-on into the house, where the mystery (even though not a great one to begin with) is revealed practically at once. To avoid spoilers I won't describe all the devious and near-ridiculous plot additions, including the attempt to make the progagonist a tragic hero, and - worst of all - an incredibly kitschy, Hollywood-inspired ending. See for yourself, if you dare...

It's not, however, the misbegotten script's fault alone. As remarked in another review, the settings have an artificial look about them and they are far too dark as well, with the house almost turned into some gloomy vampire castle, boasting a collection of mechanical toys that rivals the one in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""Sleuth"", ready to steal any ghost's show - in fact that's exactly what they do. And then it must be Daniel Radcliffe of all actors, who's bound to draw pointless Potter references by the thousands. He's not too bad though: if acting means putting on a grief-stricken look on your face and keeping it there for 90+ minutes, he succeeds.

Notwithstanding a much lower budget and complete absence of digital effects, Herbert Wise did quite an impressive job with his 1989 ""daylight"" TV version (it's not perfect, the woman herself being the problem); he wouldn't even spare us the ""evil"" ending (although again slightly changed), which is disturbing in the extreme, but consistent with the story. An ending apparently too hard on audiences of today. - Who then is expected to believe that the book's author actually approved of this concoction? Probably she had no choice.

For those familiar with the novel this film is simply unbearable; and for those who aren't, even taken as standard horror fare it should be disappointing, given the chain of stereotypes presented. That bit of period feel just can't be enough.

While England is god's chosen country of spooks without a doubt, there'll always be exceptions: see F.A. Bayona and his 2007 ""El Orfanato"". The Spanish know how to do better these days.",1344816000,2,3218,4.951851851851852

Young lawyer Arthur Kipps is a widower with a young son. After he is dispatched to a remote village by his employer, he discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.

Is it any good?

If you can ignore the barrage of haunted house cliches, this old school ghost story has some genuine chills. `The Woman in Black' is based on the 1983 Susan Hill book of the same name and is also an on going play in London's West End. The dark tone is set right from the start as three young girls having an innocent tea party, get up in a trance, walk to the window and jump to their deaths...woah! That tea is some strong shit!. But it quickly becomes clear that this movie isn't about powerful hallucinates, it's about a pissed off dead lady who hates kids. As `The Woman in Black's' vengeance is slowly revealed, so are the cliches; rocking chairs, freaky porcelain dolls, ghostly children, dark corridors and window apparitions, just to name a few. The thrills come mainly from a handful of jump-out scares, which are sharpened thanks to some nice pacing and lighting. Daniel Radcliffe is also sharp, this is his first role since `Harry Potter' and he shows some serious emotion as a young father and widower, he tackles the role with plenty of maturity and seems well beyond his 22 years. `The Woman in Black' may not shock serious horror buffs, but the jump-out scares will guarantee a close quarter nestle from your lady.

Best bit?

The dark ominous atmosphere stays consistent throughout the film.

4765258,5,B005LAIGOQ,"With the film The Woman in Black, Hammer Studios returns to their glory days of supernatural storytelling, invoking the Victorian-type ghost story in superb style. Easily one of the most stylish, most chilling horror films of the last couple of decades, this one also has a heart (as the best always do).The story plays on both the cards of the heartbroken young widower in grief over his wife's death as well as the both sad and frightening vengeful ghost whose mystery plays out and creating a truly terrifying build-up.

For his part, Daniel Radcliffe shows he can work as a reliable adult lead, supported by a highly experienced ensemble cast led by Ciarn Hinds. The film itself glories in its dark, broken beauty and makes one reminisce about haunted house classics like The Innocents (1961). There are also fairly potent visual reminders of other classic films such as The Phantom Carriage (1921) and Hammer's own Night Creatures (1962). The colors, though by no means absent, are mostly muted (making a great contrast in the few instances where they exist as striking). The music is minimal, unlike most American horror films that overwhelm with score from beginning to end.

The story, adapted directly from the Susan Hill novel of the same name (itself also the source of one of the most iconic, longest-running English plays) features all of the classic elements of a haunted house story: the large, imposing mansion, the foggy, stormy atmosphere, a background in tragedy... it's all there. The tragedy compels us to listen to the story and to open our minds to it. We each experience tragedy and loss in our lives, and that seeking to connect with what (and who) we've lost can lead us down a path of desperation, but we don't know what doors and to what horrors that desperation can lead to. That is one of the great appeals of the gothic ghost story, and it plays out in excellence here. As a traditional ghost story film, The Woman in Black may be ""by the book,"" but the book is as chilling as anyone could imagine.",1344211200,,2029,4.745042492917847

4765260,3,B005LAIGOQ,"London, the turn of the century. Widowed lawyer Arthur Kipps is sent by his office to deal with the legal affairs of Eel Marsh House, whose owners wish to sell it. He finds the local village folk uncooperative and fearful of the house, apart from rich landowner Samuel Daily (who owns the only motorcar in the village). As Kipps investigates the mystery of Eel Marsh House, he learns of a spate of unusual deaths amongst the local children and starts seeing a woman dressed in black watching his activities.

The Woman in Black is an adaptation of Susan Hill's 1983 novel of the same name. It was produced by the resurgent British company Hammer Film Productions, who in an earlier incarnation produced numerous horror films in the 1950s and 1960s. Unlike most of those films, which were noted for their use of blood and gore, The Woman in Black is a taut, claustrophobic piece which relies on tension and things glimpsed out of the corner of the eye.

The film's casting is superb, with a post-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe starring as Arthur Kipps (coincidentally, a role previously played by his on-screen father Adrian Rawlins in a 1989 TV movie based on the book). Radcliffe arguably risks more typecasting than any actor in film history, but his canny choice of stage and screen roles has seen him so far avoid that fate. In The Woman in Black he convinces in the role of the world-weary, grief-stricken father whose career as a lawyer is in doubt due to his growing disillusionment with the world. The only other major character is Samuel Daily, played with conviction by the always-excellent Ciaran Hinds.

The director, James Watkins, handles the material well. His depictions of a village consumed by fear, the huge and rambling Eel Marsh House and of lonely and windswept marshlands are all excellent, giving the film a real sense of place. Knocking in at just 95 minutes, the film also doesn't outstay its welcome.

Unfortunately, the movie shows its hand a little too early. Upon arriving in the village, Kipps is immediately greeted by fear, suspicion and terror, letting the audience know that All is Not Well. It's not long before just about every time we get a close-up on Kipps we also get some sinister stuff going on in the background, or every other time he turns around we get a shot of the Woman in Black hanging about for a moment. The first few times this happens, it's unsettling. Somewhere around the twentieth, it loses its power. Viewers will soon find themselves predicting when something 'scary' is about to happen and will, by and large, be right. The film does succeed in achieving a few genuine shocks despite this issue, the movie's second half is overall weakened by this predictability. Given writer Jane Goldman's solid form (Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class), it's surprising that she doesn't put more genuine twists into the script, especially given its deviations from the source material.

The Woman in Black (***) is well-made, excellently-acted, concise, focused and well-directed. The film is let down by its script, which relies a little too much on a single scare tactic and overplays it to the point of boredom. In this manner, The Woman in Black is the film equivalent of the computer game Doom 3: well-made, great in short bursts, but a little dull over the long haul. It is redeemed somewhat by a startling ending, however, and is certainly worth watching.",1344211200,,3413,4.847341337907376

4765262,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Based on the book of the same name by Susan Hill (which I have not read), this movie is good-scary. Creepy-scary. The kind of scary I like and can't often find. It's not gory, and it only has a couple of cheap-ish, jump-out-of-your-seat scares.  And it's a really good story to which I hope they make a sequel.  (UPDATE: They're making a sequel for 2014!)

My husband and I rented this expecting it to be bad, to be quite honest. We hadn't heard much about it and figured it was because Daniel Radcliffe hadn't been able to pull out of Harry Potter-mode. In the very beginning, he actually is very Harry-ish when interacting with his character's son, and I almost wrote the movie off right then. But after that, he made me forget that he was Potter and I was glued to the TV.  The atmosphere is great (anything with possessed Victorian wind-up dolls creeps me right out), the acting is great (after those first few bumps), and it made for a believably scary story that entertained my socks off (which is a feat, considering how much I love wearing socks.)  Radcliffe made me believe his mourning and desperation without going over the top, and I absolutely loved the ending.

Why is no one cooperative when it comes to dealing with the house and estate? Then, when he finally gets to the house, the subtle creepy sounds, look and events are perfect. Not over the top scary, but enough to put a shiver in your spine. The entire movie is suspenseful, intriguing and creepy-the story line is creative, believeable and heart tugging (especially if you are a parent). I was surprised to see Daniel ratcliff in such a dramatic role so soon after his epic Harry Potter movies, but was pleasantly surprised at his performance. This was a very mature role for him in the wake of his ""harry"" image. And i must say, I commend him. He did well. A standing ovation!

4765267,5,B005LAIGOQ,"First of all, Daniel Radcliffe is a first class actor. Not for one minute during the movie was I thinking ""Harry Potter!"". This was really my kind of thriller, I like to be scared by the story but I don't like to be nauseated by blood and gore. The storyline in The Woman in Black is what scares you, the realness of the characters and the misery of the town Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) finds himself in. Yes things will jump out at you but not so often that you want to stop watching.

The Woman in Black is a supernatural thriller in all the right ways. An unknown energy haunts the town that Arthur Kipps finds himself in at the order of his law firm. He is to investigate the estate of a woman who died who apparently had quite a bit of paperwork in her mansion located a few miles out of town. The people of the town are uneasy and unwelcoming when Kipps arrives, they try to make him leave before his work is complete. It appears to be some sort of conspiracy until more is revealed about the town's residents. They have all lost children to an unknown force which is somehow associated with the mansion left behind by the dead woman. Kipps presence in the town awakens the horror inflicted on the town by the woman in black.

I've watched this movie a few times since I first saw it and it still hasn't lost its appeal. The plot pulls you in and holds you until the movie is over.

On a side note though, it did remind me vaguely of The Ring. Anyone who's seen it will have to let me know whether they agree.",1343520000,,1512,4.206896551724138
4765288,2,B005LAIGOQ,"I was hoping that I would like this movie more, but I found it almost unwatchable. Only Daniel Radcliffe would have gotten me past the first fifteen minutes.

I'm not a big horror fan, which may be part of the problem; I'm probably out of synch with what horror fans like. But I always feel that well-done horror has some kind of point beyond nihilistic unpleasantness. Often it's a very moralistic point, which you could argue is the case here, with the evil ghost being a ""wronged woman."" But the victims of her wrath are wholly blameless of any complicity, past or present, in her sufferings, and there's never any resolution to her pain or theirs.

On top of this, the events of the film are less horrific than merely sadistic. I don't like stories that exploit the suffering of children or animals and the people who grieve for them. That's just cheap manipulation and disturbing on a whole other level--writers and filmmakers who do this seem more pathological themselves than their characters.

The movie works very, very hard to be ""scary"" and it's so obvious about it, the artifice shows. The scary old house is a really, *really* scary old house...but why was it so decrepit when its owner had died so recently that her papers were still in probate and being sorted out by lawyers? Just how long had that house been empty? Then, not only is the house already scary, it's out on a sort of point which turns into an island at high tide. Why would anyone build a big expensive mansion in such a location, and why didn't it just sink, since it's surrounded by quicksand? There are lots of scary bits with ghosts (or visions, at least) suddenly appearing or sneaking up behind, but it's like a carnival funhouse. The ghosts literally ""leap out and yell boo,"" and even as you're jumping out of your seat, you have this annoyed sense that you're just the butt of a practical joke. Since this is a movie about dead children, of course we have lots of Scary Toys, too. The contrivances are just too apparent.

I didn't read the book on which this is based, so I don't know how much the scriptwriters are to blame. You could extract a psychological mystery out of this; the protagonist, Arthur Kipps, lost his young wife when she died giving birth to their first child. Four years later, he is still so consumed by grief that his son draws pictures of him wearing black and crying because ""daddy always looks like that,"" and his bosses are fed up with him and about to fire him if he doesn't get over himself. But if Kipps has conflicted feelings toward his son, which might cause him to unconsciously hate children, the movie never implies this, so the sudden uptick in child deaths after his arrival in the village has no explanation. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it's a head-scratcher, and ultimately frustrating. You also see it coming from miles away.

I only watched this movie because Radcliffe is in it, and unlike some reviewers, I think he does a great job. If he seems a little monochromatic, it's the fault of the script, not his performance. He works hard but he's given nothing to do except be grief-stricken, scared or desperate. He's choosing unusual roles post-Harry-Potter, and while that can be a good thing for an actor, he needs to allow himself more range than *The Woman in Black* allows him to display. There are some other fine performers in this movie, especially Janet McTeer and Ciaran Hinds, and all the cast does a good job, but most of them feel wasted. The movie is so grim, pratically the only emotion anyone is allowed to show is grief.

This movie is one of the new offerings from the revived Hammer Films Productions, and it reminded me of a few of its earlier, sadder movies, in particular *<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-on-Satan-s-Claw/dp/B001Q58KXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood on Satan's Claw</a>.* It's also very reminiscent of *<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>.* But unless you're suffering from crippling happiness and euphoria and need to bring yourself down (and this one will do it), I can't recommend *The Woman in Black.*",1343433600,2,4305,4.988857938718663

I never really paid much attention to the acting in Harry Potter - that wasn't what I watched those movies for anyway... But I think Radcliffe has really proven that he's a great actor with this one.

This is one of the better ""horror"" movies that I've seen in a while. It used sound and light to create suspense, while the story was being built up. There were quite a few ""jumpy"" moments, which even though I was expecting them got me. My dog even woke up with a start twice.

The story was pretty good. A young man must go to a village where he's unwelcome and while there he uncovers their secret. As he's putting the pieces of the puzzle together children in the village start dying. The young lawyer is trying to figure how all this connects together while he accepts the hospitality of one of the wealthy families in the village. The wife appears to be a bit crazy, but she does help put some fire into plot.

The only reason this did not receive a 5 star rating was the ending. It wasn't a horrible ending, but I was expecting something different. After the puzzle is ""figured out"" I thought that would be the end. But the ending is much more sinister than I would have imagined.

I would have to say despite the PG-13 rating that it shouldn't be watched by younger kids. I think I would have to say 15 or 16 rather than 13 as the appropriate age limit. There's some graphic scenes, although they aren't necessarily violent they are disturbing none the less.

His boss gives him one last chance. He needs to go to an old, dilapidated house in some town and straighten out the paperwork after its final owner has passed. Weird stuff starts to happen and kids start to die. He gets sidetracked and needs to get to the bottom of things.

This is all so old. The creepy looking dolls, the creepy wind-up toys. The cob-webs and gloominess. Things half seen. Clues behind wallpaper. I can't believe they're still using this stuff. There are a couple of jump scares which, as any film maker should know, no longer cut it. The music score was too obvious. It underscored the on-screen happenings with a thick, black magic marker. There were a couple of genuinely creepy scenes in the third act but, by that time, it was too late.

On the production side, they DID try. The sets, though old news, were done well. The costuming was decent and good attention was paid to period detail. The acting was decent enough, though I found Radcliffe to be rather stiff. And I liked the way they ended the story. They could have sapped it up but they chose a higher road.

This isn't bad. Maybe it's made for a younger audience that hasn't been through the decades of horror films as have I.",1341878400,,1553,4.419580419580419
4765396,4,B005LAIGOQ,Good thriller.  We enjoyed it as a family and my wife had a blanket pulled up to her eyes at several points.  Glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie but well worth the PPV cost.,1341878400,,179,3.6842105263157894
4765397,3,B005LAIGOQ,"First off, I want to say that I enjoyed Daniel Radcliffe in this movie. I don't think anyone could have done a better job with the script he had to work with. I like watching serious movies, and he played this troubled character well, without overdoing it.  However, the movie moves too slowly in the beginning and waits too long to provide some necessary explanations. Also, some of the special effects are too mechanical--cheap maybe?

I didn't read the book, but the idea in this movie of what the woman in black is doing and why, and the way Radcliffe's character seeks to appease her made for a good story-line. While the ending could be called satisfying by some, I don't understand why the story ended that way.",1341705600,,718,4.6015625
4765488,5,B005LAIGOQ,"As is the case with almost all ghost stories from the UK, the skill in crafting an eerie and surreal version of the book by Susan Hill is palpable. As is evident by Susan Hill's book, and M R James' stories, the British  skill of the things at the periphery of one's vision is amazing. I would not recommend reading the book before seeing the film, however, that being said, if you have, it will not destroy your enjoyment of the film if you do. Daniel Radcliffe delivers a stellar on camera performance, and the very well chosen cast makes this story a delivered work on a brilliant level. Even the lower level scares make for some great fun in the ghost story. The commentary is well worth listening to, just as the features show a lot more of the extras. I would guess that most people will mist some of the sights out of direct vision. The locations are very well chosen, and some of these are revealed in the commentary, but so long as you go along for the ride, this is a brilliant work. I watched the film in the theatre and on one ""cheap"" scare a young woman just about pierced my ear drums, but strangely enough on the more surreal elements, she was not scared ( I can only assume she was in shock). Excellent film, great in all respects.
  Regarding the Ultraviolet copy: Don't bother. The inconvenience of setting up two accounts, and the lack of certainty first of all of any sort of availability is a problem, and the limit of Ultraviolet access beyond a few years is farcical. Insist on actual digital copies for your portable device because the cloud is an issue that will haunt your personal details, and if they do not fix security and infrastructure, Ultraviolet is another cloud idea that is a pipe dream. For a digital copy it is not worth the problem, since there are other ways to get digital copies, and IMO the companies should provide a copy in a proper digital format.",1341705600,4,1894,4.436781609195402
4765489,1,B005LAIGOQ,"Once again, my husband chose the Saturday night movie rental. I admit, ""The Help"" (my pick) was over-rated, but at least it had redeeming social value and historical relevance. Movies like The Woman in Black? Not a single interesting point. After all the hero's trouble to give the vicious dead woman what she wanted, we're left with the ol' ""No good deed goes unpunished"" message.

Gratuitious violence, gore and fun-house scare tactics in scene after scene. Look out the window, see a scary ghost face staring back at you. If you want to feel like a kid on a sleepover trying to experience terror, this is safer than sneaking out of the house to jump off a bridge --and young adults today are actually doing this, and one died, not from the jump, but from the river bacteria that shot up her sinus cavities and slowly killed her. Yeah. I only wish I was making this up.

So, stupid me, for the sake of cuddling beside my husband on the sofa for 90 minutes, I endured this stupid waste of good cinematography and movie sets. I wish I'd left the room and finished reading Jenna Blum's ""the stormchasers,"" best purchase all year from amazon, and left him with the cat, but the smooth-brained furball had the good sense to disappear instead of watching this idiotic movie. He's back now. (The cat.)I'm the one who has to bury those gruesome images before bedtime: the girl who swallowed lye, the drowned boy, the three girls leaping from the attic window, and that final scene, and if this is a spoiler, stop reading now, but did you really expect a happy ending? Stupid, pointless, stupid waste of time. Arrrghhh!!!! This is why I read the endings of books if, after a few chapters, I sense it's going to be a downer.

Would I buy it, no, should you pay to watch it, no.  This movie has a few jumpy moments, but gets rather dull as the plot goes on.  The cinematography, as with so many films this days, is very professional and the setting is very dreary, reminding me much of Jane Eyre.  So, yes stylistically this film is cool and it was entertaining; however, the characters and the precarious plot ruined it for me.  The characters are rather dull, and flat, and I found it hard to attach myself to their emotions, or care about their fate.  The plot was also a letdown.  The ending seemed contrived, like the writers couldn't think of an ending so they followed the typical suit of love or death, and a lot was left unexplained.

4765536,5,B005LAIGOQ,"This is my very first review for any product or movie on Amazon. I never write reviews, because I feel like 1 opinion won't make a difference in the long run. Despite that, this movie touched me so deeply that I just had to share my experience with those looking for an opinion.

I am an avid fan of supernatural horror. I strongly dislike slasher movies, especially since the blood and gore is often as fake as the horrible acting. Needless to say, I've pretty much seen every ghost and ""haunting"" movie that I could get my hands on. Because of that, I expected this to be another ""run of the mill"" ghost story. I will agree with some reviewers that the plot of the movie isn't revolutionary. However, the techniques and scares used in this film are a pleasant surprise.

Daniel Radcliffe truly made me connect with his character. He does an astounding job in this movie. His deep, straightforward, blue eyes add to the atmosphere of the movie. In most scenes, he is alone, but that doesn't detract from the mood of the film at all. He carries the movie to new heights with his brilliant performance.

The effects are amazing. The graphics and ""old-school"" techniques used for the scares here work wonders. I am not an easy scare, yet I found myself so enraptured and entranced by the tension that I was gripping the seat and biting my nails at some points. Even an hour after watching the movie, I was still remembering parts of it and rubbing my arms to get rid of my goosebumps. The only other movie that scared me this much was ""The Haunting"", a film that was incredible and worth watching many times over.

To the reviewers leaving such poor scores - Yes, of course everyone will react differently. Not all movies will please everyone. Some will see ""fake"" effects, while others don't ""connect"" with the characters. In the end, it's all a matter of opinion. Still, I hope that those trying to decided whether this movie is worth it or not will consider giving this film a fair chance. Just decide what sort of you person you are - are you willing to relax and put yourself in this character's shoes, or will you spend the entirety of the film looking for ""fake"" effects?

4765582,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Not that I'm a believer in the realm of the dead.  But I do enjoy watching the ""realistic"" possibilities of a paranormal event.  There is nothing that screams ""GHOSTS"" more than the old haunted house with spirits of the dead ingredient.  Unfortunately, too many new horror films jump into the realm of monsters rather than stick with the basic ingredient containing the spirits of dead people.  The latter gives me a more realistic feel.  I know monsters won't come through my walls, but spirits of dead people?  Well, not that I believe, but it's still way creepier since you can walk around your own house wondering about its history and who has died in it.  This movie is finally a new movie, which sticks to the ""real"" haunted house feel.  Sounds of footsteps, rocking chairs, dolls that seems to come to life, spooky spirits of once living people, graves, and a very old large empty house... all good ingredients.  They left Godzilla and Freddy Krueger out, which is a good thing.  Not since the Exorcist played with people's ""realistic"" religious images of the devil did I find a movie sticking to a person's true expectation of what is scary not only on the screen, but also off screen.  The fear jumps off the screen into your room because it sticks with the same things you would expect to see and hear should you believe your own house was haunted.  I loved it.  But it does come down to what you personally find scary: (1) A film that sticks with what you would expect if you ""realistically"" thought your house was haunted or (2) a film with gore, blood, and more monstrous creations.  Those expecting the latter would be disappointed, while the former would probably enjoy this.

By the way, in that reference to the Exorcist, just to clarify things, I am not comparing the two.  Nothing will probably ever compare to the original Exorcist.  I only bring it up to indicate that at least this movie is a step in the right direction to keep ""haunting"" movies in the realm of the spirits and paranormal (like the Exoricist) rather than always jumping into the commission of ""unrealistic"" monsters.",1340496000,,2106,4.679347826086956

4765586,4,B005LAIGOQ,"It's nice to have Hammer Studios back making horror films. This was the stuff I grew up on watching creature-features on Saturday afternoons with actors like Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt in their stable of stars, and a low-budget sensibility with a particular affinity for day-for-night shooting, busty ladies in tight corsets and pea-soup-thick atmosphere.

However, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is not quite a horror film as it is a supernatural mystery. And it sadly doesn't have the tightly-corseted ladies, but as far as atmosphere, the cup runneth over. Endless mist, sunless days, torrential rain, candlelit hallways and always something lurking in the back of the frame.

The plot of the film is very standard for a turn-of-the-20th-century haunted village story. A young widower (Radcliffe in a very mature performance) is sent on behalf of his law firm to clear up the estate of a wealthy recluse in a remote British town. The villagers in the town want him gone for unknown reasons, but he goes to the old mansion called Eel Marsh (sounds like a nice place, doesn't it?) and uncovers an unearthly presence and a mystery that has been taking the lives of children there for years. With his own child coming to visit him, he endeavors, with the help of a kindly man (the always great Ciaran Hinds) and his troubled wife (Janet McTeer, great in a small role), to give the ghost what he believes it needs to end its reign of terror.

I'm always a little leery of ghost films because the cause of the haunting is usually far too mundane and that always leaves me wishing that it's not such a mystery as to why it's happening, and rather just have it HAPPEN. It lends a greater mystery and discomfort to the viewer and leaves us to ask questions after the film ends. That was my biggest problem with Robert Zemeckis' WHAT LIES BENEATH. That's also a bit of a problem here, but because of a nicely twisted ending, we find that their solution to the mystery isn't enough.

Radcliffe really leaves Harry Potter behind in this film, and it's wonderful to see him really embrace this role. He's someone who is very wounded deep within his soul, and it makes sense that he would be more willing to explore the world of the unknown searching for answers. Hinds is once again great at a supporting role as the only man in the village who seems to be unafraid of what Radcliffe's character is doing, but there's a deeper weariness to Hinds as is revealed later. McTeer is wonderfully manic but not over-the-top loony as the still-grieving mother to a child long dead.

This film embraces mood and atmosphere in favor of blood and shock, keeping with the tradition of Hammer Studios well. There are three or four really cheap but effective jump scares in the first act, and this is honestly the first film in years that I actually did feel my heart skip at some of those moments. Once that calms down, the cheap scares make way for a sense of genuine dread, which is something director James Watkins handles pretty deftly. Most of the film is very quiet, which makes the frightening noises that come out of that quiet much more effective. He also is adept at framing his shots. Many of the moments of the film look as though they could be gothic-era paintings.

Sadly, the film becomes pretty sluggish in the third act as they feel they've found the solution to the desires of the spectre and do what they can to sate those desires. If the film had more of an adult appeal, I feel that this would have been more of a character study rather than a film of actions and consequences, but since it's Daniel Radcliffe, they had to make it more teen-friendly. I don't feel that those roles are far off at all for Radcliffe, having done a play like the extremely dark EQUUS, and they suit his seemingly perennial five-o'clock shadow and his intense and piercing eyes.

Radcliffe is a young man who, even if he hadn't been in one of the most successful franchises of all time, would still have eventually become a star, and THE WOMAN IN BLACK is decidedly good evidence of that.",1340150400,,4073,4.617403314917127

4765649,5,B005LAIGOQ,"In an age where the idea of horror is suppose to be one bloody gruesome scene followed by another more bloody and gruesome scene, there is a horror movie out there that relies on the old fashion way of scaring the crap out of you. With suspence and excellant film editing that will make you jump out of your seat. That movie is ""The Woman In Black"". It harks back to 40, 50 even 60 years ago to the golden age horror movies. I love a good horror story as much as the next person but over the last couple of decades I have found the horror movies made during this time to lack imagination and have no story or plot to it.

4765650,4,B005LAIGOQ,"If you're like me you grew up watching horror films made by Hammer Studios. These were not your run of the mill horror films but classily made films that featured some of the classic horror icons like Dracula and Frankenstein but in more of a gothic location. This was a world of castles and mansions, of men dressed in fine clothing and women in low cut laced gowns. The horror films made by Hammer had style and class and a certain amount of eeriness to them instead of gore. The studio fell on hard times but is in the midst of a return and their first major entry is a grand one called THE WOMAN IN BLACK.

It's the turn of the century and Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is at his wits end. A solicitor by trade Kipps has fallen on hard times, having great difficulty in dealing with the death of his wife several years earlier during childbirth. His son has grown but Kipps' melancholia remains these years later. So much so that he's fallen on hard times. The firm he works for gives Kipps a last chance to redeem himself by sending him to the small town of Cryphin Gifford to the Eel Marsh House where the estate of Mrs. Drablow, a recently deceased woman, must be settled. Kipps heads out hoping to reunite with his son and his nanny on the weekend.

On his train ride to the town Kipps meets a gentleman by the name of Sam Daily (Ciaran Hinds). Sam is also en route to the same location and offers Kipps a ride to the local inn. But what greets Kipps when he enters is not what he expected: a cold shoulder from all but the inn keeper's wife who offers him a small room in the attic. He receives more of the same when he contacts the local solicitor who's been handling the affairs of the estate. Given the brush off and a carriage to take him to the train station, he pays the man to take him to the estate itself.

If the creepy factor weren't already oozing off the screen it does so in spades as Kipps makes his way to the estate. The mansion is located on a small island with a causeway that twists and turns up to it. All along nothing but the marsh can be seen, a gooey water trap if ever there was one, with plenty of sea beyond. The tides rise and close off the causeway throughout the day and the carriage driver agrees to return later to take Kipps to Sam's house for a dinner invitation.

Walking on to the house Kipps is greeted by the best of gothic sights, a mansion in disrepair covered with vines on the outside and cobwebs within. He lights some candles and gathers what paperwork he finds and begins working. But noises within the house cause him to stop and seek what is creating the sounds. As Kipps passes from one room to another, we have the chance to see the woman in black as her spectral image lingers over Kipps without allowing him to see her. She's everywhere yet nowhere in this house and the director of the film does a fine job in creating the atmosphere of her presence without seeing her at all times.

Kipps eventually goes to dinner at Sam's and meet's his wife. She begins to tell him things that will lead him to discover the truth behind the town's fright and the reason they want him gone. Her tale and other clues lead Kipps to find out about the sister of the Mrs. Drablow who was sent away while her son was adopted by Drablow and her husband. On a trip home one night, their carriage slid into the marsh and the boy was drowned, his body never recovered. Now when the woman in black is seen a child in the town dies.

Kipps continues his work, dealing with both the house and its foreboding inhabitant and continuing to deal with the loss of his wife. The intrusion of the woman in black in his business as well as the lives of others becomes too much and he seeks a way to appease her and put her soul to rest. This becomes all the more important as he has no way of reaching his son en route to the town to possibly be her next victim.

The movie does a wonderful job of offering us teasing scares that never go over the top. The chilling moments are found from start to finish, the locale's offering the feelings that something bad is going to happen and the acting complements the storytelling that delivers chills rather than one jump scene after another (though there are those). Best of all is seeing Radcliffe in a role other than Harry Potter, proving that there is a chance of his becoming an actor that can handle more than the namesake that brought him to attention.

The movie is one of the old time scare films that doesn't rely on gore, doesn't rely on a hatchet wielding menace or a nightmare creation that sucks out your soul as you sleep. This is good old fashioned ghost story that makes your skin crawl while you wait for the next scare and that's a good thing to see. Welcome back Hammer.",1339977600,,4764,4.285555555555556
4765651,4,B005LAIGOQ,"IS this one of the super scary, gory ones?  No.  It's more of the traditional kind that leaves you on the edge of your seat and anticipating what's coming next.  It is rather predictable but that doesn't lessen the enjoyment of it.  And I did enjoy it a great deal.  It didn't live up to the fully, out and out scary I think it was going for but it's good nonetheless.  Daniel Radcliffe did give a wonderful performance in it and the acting was quite good.  My only real issue is a problem that some of us older folks have; the really dark scenes (as in lighting) were hard to see and to be able tell what was going on.  Even watching during the day I had a hard time seeing what was going on in some of it.  That, most assuredly, does affect the enjoyment level of things.  I understand what they were going for with some of it and to set the mood but that doesn't help when you can't see enough of what is going on to tell what they are doing or see something they are reacting to.

Overall, though, it was a decent movie.  Far better than what Hammer usually puts out.",1339977600,,1071,4.120772946859903

4765653,3,B005LAIGOQ,"The Woman in Black film version pales in comparison to the book by Susan Hill, as it not only uses typical Hollywood gimmicks to get scares, but has deficiencies that lessen the creepiness factor. The biggest problem in the film is that everything is obvious, blatant and upfront, given to us in the initial stages of the film on a silver platter so we know what to expect. There's little in the way of true build up to give any heightened suspense; they just kind of rush Kipps (played by Daniel Radcliffe) to the house as soon as possible, and then the residents and locals try to rush him out of the house. Another problem is simply that we don't quite get into the head of Kipps as much in the film. Seeing things from his perspective as he sees them--as he slowly realizes the history of the house and the woman-- makes the novel much more effectively atmospheric, something not accomplished as well in this film. There are a few scares scattered a few places, and the story does come into focus aptly in the second part, especially as he finds out the woman's history, but mainly this film just felt too rushed and lacks any subtlety.

Instead, The Woman in Black builds tension through creepy imagery and mixes it with jump-out scares. The scares are so well balanced! There is a segment in the film that will have scare after scare. The creepy atmosphere was also great. Acting was fine and so was the music. The only problem I had was the predictable third act/ending; I felt like I had seen it done many times before.

Genuinely creepy, scary flicks, no. The Woman in Black is a genuinely creepy movie. It has great atmosphere and subtle creeps that build into a goosepimple-inducing conclusion. I love that some of the scares are so subtle that, if you're not paying attention, you may miss them. I'm 48 and, if I think about this movie too much before going to bed, I have to leave the light on for awhile until I quit thinking about it because it creeps me out. I know some people don't like the limited dialogue but, since Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe's character)spends much of his time at Eel Marsh House alone, limited dialogue is logical. I'd think it strange if he wandered around spewing  a constant monologue (just because I talk to MYself, doesn't mean NORMAL people do.) Also the dialogue isn't needed or missed, as everything is explained if you pay attention. Even without the extensive dialogue, Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job of projecting his character's loneliness, heartbreak, and growing worry that he's losing his grip on his sanity. The very last shot before the credits gave me the shivers. I LOVE the shivers! Great, great movie.",1339718400,4,1297,4.8954545454545455

This movie had me on the edge of my seat for a large majority of the movie! Especially when -spoiler alert- Arthur goes into the marsh to retrieve Nathaniel's corpse and then when he's trying to summon the Woman in Black. I got a big jump out of what happens next. That one scene, along with the window scene, left a big impression on me. -Spoilers over-

Daniel Radcliffe's acting was excellent! I say that it was a step forward from his Harry Potter roles. While others say that he was emotionless, I disagree. I thought that his face conveyed enough emotion to sum up the suspense. I rarely thought of Harry Potter in this movie, but one of my friends did. He screamed ""Use your wand, Potter!"" during the summoning scene.

Anyway, most ""Horror"" films rely on blood spraying every five seconds such as Scream. I think that this movie is a good sign for horror films, and I hope more scary movies like this come out.",1339632000,10,1092,4.482412060301508
4765690,3,B005LAIGOQ,"There can be too many ""boo!"" moments in a film, I realized as I watched ""The Woman In Black."" A ""boo!"" moment, of course, is when the camera pans across a room and, just for a second, we see a demon watching our hero (in this case, Daniel Radcliffe), or, the camera lingers upon an object (a window, say) while our hero looks outside, and then...a face appears in the window next to him! Noooo!

Save for these moments (and there are a lot of them), ""The Woman In Black"" is a quiet, effective ghost story set in Victorian England. A woman with a secret past dies, and leaves a mansion behind that must have been built by architects related to H. R. Giger. Needless to say, the mansion is haunted, and poor Daniel Radcliffe, besot by financial problems, must try his darndest to sell it so that he can make a life for his son, even as the local villagers give him the evil eye for daring to step foot in the mansion. Why one of these villagers never simply runs up to him and says, ""There's a crazy ghost-witch in that house and she does awful things to people when you go into her house!"" I'll never know, but instead they hang back and scowl at Radcliffe's character as he just tries to go about his day.

If it all sounds rather generic, well, it is. But the movie, crafted by a reboot of the old Hammer Films Studio, is technically well-done and written competently enough to create a decent experience out of an overdone genre. There are too many ""boo!"" moments, yes, but the overall mood of the film is rather somber and creepy. The set design is great, and the clattering little tinker toys that fill up the mansion shelves are among the most horrid toys I've ever seen in my life. The plot moves smoothly and never gets bogged down in unnecessary exposition or bloated pretension. The movie knows what it wants to be. It is a haunted house movie, through and through, and while that lack of ambition makes it somewhat mundane, it also ensures that the movie never overstays its welcome. There's a horrible mansion, a cruel ghost, and an awful secret, and that is as far as the narrative extends. Radcliffe is likable, the ghost is appropriately furious, and the ending, while obvious, doesn't cheat.

All in all, a competent piece of genre fiction that will entertain you and then quickly fade from your memory. You could do much worse.",1339459200,,2343,4.469626168224299

4765692,2,B005LAIGOQ,"I rented this movie from Redbox because the trailer had looked interesting. The acting and premise of the movie were promising, but the story seemed underdeveloped. Daniel Radcliff ventures to a mysterious small town where the people seem to want to get rid of him as quickly as possible. We learn this is because of a local superstition that results in the death of the town's children. Sounds interesting enough, but the story tends to drag, and there isn't really anything to differentiate this movie from others in the genre. Throughout the movie we see similar sequences played over and over--a good portion of the movie is just Radcliff walking around a house.

The story falls short and does nothing to invigorate an already stale genre. This movie is worth a rent at best, which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to seeing Radcliff in a new role.",1339372800,,865,4.805369127516778
4765693,2,B005LAIGOQ,"The atmosphere infusing every scene and setting for ""The Woman in Black"" is so heavy, unrelenting, and smothering, that it is hard to just watch the movie or delve into the story. I've never seen a film that so unrelentingly reminds its audience of its intention through such a thick slathering of motif, artifice, lighting, and gloom.

Yes, this is a ghost story, a horror tale that should be frightening. There are long hallway shots in the haunted mansion that mimic Kubrick's corridors in that mammoth hotel in The Shining, shots that should build even more dread and anticipation than they do. The rooms are filled with so many oddities and antiques (someone really had a thing about monkeys, perhaps a homage to those flying terrors from the ""Wizard of Oz"") that these inanimate curiosities stole the scenes from the actors.

The actors---chiefly the male leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds---all seem to be walking through the sets as though they had been dropped into a carnival fun house and left to improvise reactions and lines. The ghostly woman in black startles more than she frightens, and most of the remaining characters seem stricken with dread and grief, making one wonder why they did not leave this dreadful place.

The plot trajectory, alas, moved in a straightforward, if slow, line to the inevitable conclusion, which suggests that the studio was more interested in potential sequels than telling a good story the first time out.",1339372800,2,1466,5.0
4765694,4,B005LAIGOQ,"James Watkins' ""The Woman In Black"" is a superb, bone-chilling return to the freezy tradition of Hammer Studios.  Daniel Radcliffe (of ""Harry Potter"" fame) turns in a fine performance as London lawyer Arthur Kipps.  An impoverished father haunted by the loss of his wife during childbirth, his employer gives him a make-or-break assignment by sending him to the remote village of Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow.

Mrs. Drawblow was a disturbed woman.  Her child was lost tragically, not unlike the protagonists', by drowning in a marsh.  The locals are particularly unreceptive to Mr. Kipps' presence and he is shunned by all but one man, determined to help him see the job through.

The pacing and atmosphere of this movie are damn near perfect.  Reminiscent of much of Hammer's later work (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Beyond-the-Grave/dp/B000TUDBGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Beyond the Grave</a>), the cobwebs and impoverished area add to the suspense.  What really clinched it for me were the scenes in which Kipps is alone in Mrs. Drablow's house and reads her letters, the scary voice overdubbing and the creepy puppets moving all at the same time.  One thinks of a malevolent Emily Dickinson or something, it's just really fantastic.

The only problem I had was with the ending.  While I won't spoil it for anyone, they should have let it happen raw without the fluffernutter.  That said, this is recommended for anyone who still cherishes Hammer's legacy, and just a fantastic horror film amongst the dross.",1339286400,2,1655,5.421875
4765695,5,B005LAIGOQ,"Eureka!!!  Finally a modern day Horror film which discards CGI as an overwhelming crutch and goes for the jugular as Director James Watkins updates Writer Susan Hill's chilling ghost story 'THE WOMAN IN BLACK' and shows how true Horror films have been sorely missed over the past few decades.  The gothic Horror tale has long since been left in the dust by the supposed chillers of hacks such as Wes Craven , M. Night Shayamalan, Rob Zombie , to name but a few. With cheap tricks, gore effects,and screenplays which seem to succeed with modern audiences , none have even touched the terrifying sequences within this film.  Yes, they have their fans and supporters but they wouldn't know true Horror if it bit them where the sun don't shine.  Mr. Watkins, however, has done his homework by creating a beautifully chilling nightmare with such incredible atmosphere, you can feel the mist and fog come right through the monitor.  Daniel Radcliffe, who was criticized as being too young for the role, is excellent and Ciaran Hinds lends great support as Director Watkins glides his camera through an absolutely terrifying encounter with a haunted mansion. With a bone chilling score by Marco Beltrami and superior cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones, this is a film that truly lives up to the cliche, 'Don't watch it alone'.  I happened to view this film with at least four other Horror fans who have seen countless ghost films over the years and I counted no fewer than 8 times that they jumped right out of their skins, something modern day Horror tries to emulate but never succeed.  The film is released by Hammer Films of England who were responsible for a literal Horror renaissance beginning in the mid fifties and lasting to the early seventies but not even those photoplays have the class of this true Horror masterpiece.  If you love the films of Val Lewton and think that the champion of all ghost stories, Director Robert Wise's 'THE HAUNTING'- 1963 is the definitive haunted house thriller , you will be surprised. If ever a film was perfect for the Blu-Ray format, this is it as Sony releases it in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with jaw dropping 5.1 DTS sound.  Ignore the negative reviews that many gave to this film and experience a truly terrifying tone poem, one that the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' films try to succeed at but ultimately fail.",1339286400,4,2349,4.80893300248139

I'm a little surprised that so many reviews comment on Daniel Radcliffe as though he is a revelation in this movie. He was an accomplished child actor before Harry Potter and has done a number of things during and since the Potter films.

4765752,3,B005LAIGOQ,"When reading my movie review, I'd like you to please consider the perspective of an individual who has seen many films in his life - most especially the horror genre has always fascinated me since I was 7-8 years old. There is nothing like the exhilarating feeling of a good scare whether you are watching a serial killer storyline unfold or a supernatural narrative take place. Having had the rare pleasure, but more often the discontentment, of having viewed many a Horror movie, I have instinctively learned to anticipate the plot of a story or predict the scenes. It isn't only that I've seen so many films with a similar scheme, but rather that there a lot of film studios that are only interested in making a profit and fail to make a good effort at hiring decent screenwriters, cinematographers, directors and so on. After all, it is a business and financing films for a profit is worthy of concern.

I'll end this involuntary history lesson by briefly acknowledging the return of Hammer films as producers of The Woman In Black - since the 1930's, Hammer has come to be known as a well-respected institution. Imitation being the highest compliment possible, other film studios began adopting a `Hammer formula' and churned out films like there was no tomorrow, unconsciously causing Hammer to collapse and shut down amidst the sea of Hammer ""wanna be's"". Marking Hammer's return to film from its deep slumber is the gothic supernatural thriller The Woman In Black.

I would like to echo what has been already stated about the film - disturbingly moody, palpable environment, eerie soundtrack, etc. but also offer a comparison between The Woman In Black and The Changeling. No, not the Angelina Jolie movie, but the George C. Scott film from 1980. The most striking aspect of these 2 films is the obvious fact that both Radcliffe and Scott play widowers males still grieving over the loss of a loved one. What follows is the collapse of rational thinking through a fractured emotional state of being into the belief of an afterlife and everything that comes with that notion. Both films allow the suspense and scares to build to a crescendo instead of implementing scenes of gore or devices of carnage. Both characters become infatuated, almost to the point of being spellbound, by the mysterious goings-on respectively but whereas Scott is adept at allowing the physical and emotional out pour to connect visually, Radcliffe is only capable at portraying a sense of melancholy. Even at the end of the film, he seems slightly impassive and misses an optimal opportunity to come about full circle with the destiny of his life via his actions.

Bottom Line: There is plenty to like about The Woman In Black and if you go into it armed with patience (the action unfolds slow but deliberate), the firm awareness that Radcliffe will not be portraying his trademark wizard boy alter ego, and a firm acceptance that horror can be defined in many varied ways (that includes Justin Bieber's music), then you will be handsomely rewarded with a clever, well fashioned film. Radcliffe has done well and I'm confident he will find his footing in the world before too long, but special note that bears mentioning is Ciarn Hinds who is in great form as Radcliffe's new friend in town.",1339113600,3,3276,4.8464285714285715
4765753,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I like horror movies, but it seems like most horror movies these days are really slasher films.  The more blood and guts, the better.  The Woman in Black doesn't follow this formula and it is most appreciated.

Mr. Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young attorney sent to a small rural town with only one objective: close out the account of a recently deceased widow.  When he arrives in town, people treat him coldly and you are left wondering why.  Only one man (the most wonderfully talented Ciaran Hinds) offers to help him while he attempts to gather documentation at the widow's house.

Soon after he arrives, children in the local town start dying.  Not only are they dying, they are committing suicide in the most horrible ways.  Does it have some connection with a woman in black seen at the old house?  Of course!

The story is a little slower than most thrillers but it all comes together in the end and there are plenty opportunities to jump out of your skin.  The director goes for psychological scares instead of gruesome kills and it's totally worth it.  Excellent story, excellent cast.",1338940800,7,1098,4.69109947643979

I, for one, enjoyed Harry Potter, but loved that Daniel Radcliff was so easily able to come out of the roll of HP and play Arthur so beautifully, he is definitely a true talent and I look forward to seeing his later works.  As per Woman in Black, we have a classic haunting story, with far more twists and turns as the haunting is not isolated to the single location or family, the involvement is deeper, this is not just about the bumps in the night.  The location and era were very well done, the entire cast, and character development was believable.  The ""lulls"" in the film are not drawn out time killers, but if you pay attention, they are clues to the characters and what is to come, making them, to me, interesting.  I found the film to be excellent, especially in a time where the best box office films have included unrealistic craziness such as Saw and Paranormal Activity films.  The only reason I have chosen 4 and not 5 stars is because I felt the film could have been longer and added more to the back story of the family, and maybe more to the ending, even.

A young lawyer, severely depressed since the death of his young bride during childbirth, is given a last chance to succeed at his job. He is to settle the affairs of a deceased wealthy widow near a remote coastal village.

Upon arrival in the village he is greeted with disdain and is made most unwelcome.

It would seem that the widow's house is believed to be haunted and the villagers don't want him stirring up problems for them.

Set in the Edwardian era, this film is full of great Hammer Films atmosphere: fog, cool colors, damp, excellent sets and costumes.

You will not find a single four letter word, no nudity and no double entendres, but you will find it full of chills and spooky goings on.

While the ending of the film is ultimately a bit derivative, everything leading up to it is edge of your seat British classic horror.

I highly recommend it!",1338854400,,976,4.595375722543353
4765838,4,B005LAIGOQ,"This was not a perfect movie. The pacing was odd with a very slow drawn out beginning and an all too abbreviated finish. Almost as if the director decided the he needed to wrap the movie up quickly after some point. There was much that could have been done to prolong the suspense and foreshadow the conclusions. The ending had a slight Disneyesque feel to it that I didn't like. I almost expected animated birds to pop out singing.
That said this is a movie worth watching (but not alone). I do not get frightened very easily but this movie scared me to pieces. Daniel Radcliffe was very much able to step beyond Harry Potter in this movie and I am impressed by that. His facial expressions, vocal tone, and responses were very unique to the character and allowed him to become immersed in the role. C. Hinds is an outstanding actor and does a fabulous job here too. I would recommend this movie to anyone but it could be too intense for smaller children. Also because children are the victims in this movie it could be traumatizing  to younger viewers.",1338768000,,1054,4.518324607329843
4765839,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Daniel Radcliffe has shed his Harry Potter persona in this scary victorian-era thriller.

Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a lawyer who has recently lost his wife during childbirth.  Kipps has been given one last chance to prove his worth to his employer.  He is assigned to travel to Crythin Gifford to resolve the affairs of a recently deceased woman.  Upon arriving, Kipps receives a chilling response from the townspeople, except for Sam (Ciaran Hinds).

Journeying to the remote mansion located deep in the marshes, Kipps begins to uncover a gruesome tale of death as well as the mysterious ""Woman in Black"".  Many of village's children have died, and each time, the mysterious woman has been present.  While in the mansion, Kipps has seen ghostly apparitions and heard mysterious noises.  Soon, Kipps is engulfed in a terrifying quest to discover the truth about the deaths of the children while trying to unlock the mystery of the woman in black.

I thought this was a good movie, but I did have some difficulty following it in certain parts.  Radcliffe and Hinds give good performances, and there are some very scary scenes, but there were parts where I couldn't follow along.  I originally saw this movie in the theater and I was hoping that by watching it on DVD, I would get more clarity.  I was able to pick more up by watching it on DVD, but there were still parts that left me confused.  However, there are some very scary parts in the movie, and the story is good.  I recommend this movie, but just be prepared to watch closely.",1338768000,,1543,4.708955223880597

Arthur Kipps lost his wife during child-birth of their son 4 years ago, he is still grieving for her and has been down on his luck ever since. He is to get the paperwork of the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow of Eel Marsh House sorted and look to see if she made a will. But when he gets to the village of Cryphin Gifford his reception is anything but pleasant or welcoming. Lucky for Arthur Kipps he befriended Mr Daily on the train who gives him a ride to the Inn.

As Arthur moves around the village children are pulled into houses, doors and windows are shut and curtains drawn. Where ever he goes people want him to leave and when he finally gets to Eel Marsh House the gloomy and very spooky house is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a woman that is dressed in black. The more time he spends at Eel Marshy House the more afraid the villagers and Arthur Kipps become.

The longer he stays the more fearful the villagers get and the more accidents claim their children. This movie is one that will scare you out of your seats, the atmosphear builds and builds and releases to make you jump and scream. I loved this movie and the ending is one that surprized me. This is a movie that will not dissapoint you.

The flashbacks to the character's lost wife should have brought a tear or two to his eye but nothing but a blank stare each time.

The Woman In Black, however, is an old fashioned ghost story. And much better for it. It also relies very heavily on a single actor. In this case Daniel Radcliffe.

This is the first time I've seen anything other than the Harry Potter movies and it is a little difficult to move past that image of him. Indeed at one point I found myself wondering where his glasses were, before realizing he didn't have any. But his understated performance was perfect for the role and he was able to capture my attention for the large portions of the film where he was the only character on screen.

As I mentioned this is an old fashioned sort of ghost story. And it moves at an old fashioned pace that may not be to everyone's tastes. I loved the slow build up though.

There are a lot of ghost story tropes here. Faces in windows; dogs barking; unwelcoming villagers. Some may say it's unoriginal I suppose. I think of it more as using the familiar elements to build suspense and fear. The movie is particularly good at giving you moments of quiet and then making you jump.

I'd say this one is a definite watch.",1338076800,2,1294,4.420168067226891

4765945,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Read the various reviews here on Amazon and you'll find that, for the most part, people were either very impressed or incredibly bored with THE WOMAN IN BLACK. Put me in the former category for I love a good ghost story and there are way too few of them these days especially in the movies. THE WOMAN IN BLACK does exactly what it sets out to do, give Daniel Radcliffe an adult post-HARRY POTTER role and craft (that word is key to the proceedings) an old school Victorian style ghost story in the tradition of M. R. James (if you don't know the name, Google him. It will explain a lot).

I have never read Susan Hill's book nor been able to jet over to London to see the long running play but I do have the 1989 TV-Movie that was adapted by Nigel Kneale (of QUATERMASS fame) on VHS. That version stars Adrian Rawlings who, ironically, would play Harry Potter's father James in the HP movies. I liked that version very much but have read elsewhere that the author didn't care for it. Apparently there are wholesale changes in that version including giving the characters different names. It was well done for a TV film with one very effective jump-out-of-your-skin moment.

Back to this newest incarnation which is a co-production of the recently revived Hammer Films whose earler efforts (THE RESIDENT, WAKE WOOD, LET ME IN) have met with limited success. This WOMAN IN BLACK restores the characters' names and is apparently closer to what the author intended as she has given this version her blessing. However it too has its own share of differences including changing the central character into a widower with a young son and beefing up a character (Janet McTeer) who somehow has a link to the beyond.

For those of you unfamiliar with the plot of the film, here it is. Young solicitor Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), whose wife died giving birth, is sent to a remote English village to tidy up the affairs of a recently deceased woman. Once there he is greeted with hostility by the locals and is befriended by the local squire (Ciarin Hinds). Staying in the decaying house that was her home, he is subject to strange sounds and visions that include a woman in mourning and a number of dead children. These are the children of the villagers who are systematically being driven to kill themselves by this woman. After arriving at a solution Kipps hopes to implement it and stop the strange goings on.

Director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman have carefully crafted an old school ghost story with all the classic elements. There are sudden sounds, quick cuts, and an effective music score that help to deliver some genuine shocks. There is even a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that runs for half an hour without any dialogue which will either have you on the edge of your seat or will put you to sleep depending on how you respond to it. After you have watched the film, watch it again with Watkins' and Goldman's bonus commentary and you can see exactly how well crafted the film is. The performances by all concerned, not just the principals, are all first rate and this only adds to the overall impact.

The one sequence of the film that I didn't like is the ending. I won't give it away but it forgoes the central element of the Victorian ghost story and that is the power of redemption. Once the wrong has been righted, the results should have been different. It is possible to interpret the ending as a thank you gift of sorts but in the commentary the filmmakers state what they intended and it is that which I disagree with. Nevertheless I found THE WOMAN IN BLACK to be top drawer entertainment and I plan to return to it on several occasions. It can take its place along with THE HAUNTING (1963), THE CHANGELING (1979 - George C. Scott not Angelina), and THE OTHERS (2001) as one of the handful of great cinematic ghost story adaptations.",1338076800,3,3871,4.588150289017341

There is very little dialogue and very little character development, but the locations are magnificent, the cinematography is glorious (Tim Maurice Jones) and the musical score (Marco Beltrami) is chilling. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an elegantly creepy, atmospheric, British period style ghost story.

When a friendless old widow dies in the seaside town of Crythin, young solicitor Arthur Krips (Daniel Radcliffe), who lives with his four-year old son Joseph (Misha Handley) - Arthur's wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) died in childbirth) - and Joseph's Nanny (Jessica Raine), is sent by his firm to settle the estate. Arthur finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about or go near the woman's dreary home and no one will explain or even acknowledge the fact that he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is no filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. Ignoring the towns-people's cryptic warnings (they are trying to conceal a deadly secret), he goes to the house where he discovers its horrible history and becomes ensnared in its even more horrible legacy.

Along the way Arthur is befriended by Dailey (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and his strange insane wife (Janet McTeer) and Dailey is the only man willing to transport Arthur across the tide covered marshes to the haunted estate. The story is basically dealing with life after death - in the person of ghosts who stay around to wreck vengeance for their deaths - and the many events that suggest that indeed there is a place after death is borne out by story's strange ending.

Daniel Radcliffe manages to carry his role well (the designers keep him with a fashionable 5 o'clock shadow to prove he has outgrown Harry Potter) and the subordinate cast is strong in the miniscule parts they are given. This is a mood piece, a ghost story of the old-fashioned sort, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. You either like these films or you don't.

4766009,4,B005LAIGOQ,"A young grieving lawyer, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) is sent to a remote village to settle the estate of a recently deceased woman who had a quite large English manor. It is very clear from his first arrival that the locals do not want him there, and that they are hiding a terrible secret. As child deaths start to occur in the village, the hatred of the villagers is set against Kipps, and he must, with the help of his friend Sam Daily, seek to unravel out what happened at Eel Marsh House, and who is the woman in black.

Based off of a novel of the same name by Susan Hill, and set in the early 1900's England, this unique film was, to me, a very welcome surprise. Out of a very wide genre filled with generic and sometimes pathetic offerings, this one stands out as one of the best horror films I've seen a good while. While keeping the tension, gradually building the dread and at the same time intensifying the mystery, this film is a superb piece of entertaining, thrilling and engaging storytelling. Backed by great acting on Radcliffe's part, (which frankly, I wasn't sure about at first either, he surprised me) and snap directing by Watkins,  the film kept my interest, and kept me in suspense the whole time. It does have its jumping moments, but do not get the idea this is a movie filled with cheap thrills, it is an intelligent and fine example of suspenseful storytelling, one that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.

Also, I must comment on the filming of it. The lighting and framing of the shots in this piece was absolutely brilliant. Props to them for building such a great atmosphere throughout the film in that regard.

As for content, there's not much to list. When it comes to the disturbing content, I'd say the PG-13 was well earned. The deaths of children occur infrequently throughout the movie and the ghostly woman in black is a quite frightening figure as well. Add in a couple of scenes of extreme tension involving ghosts and it's for sure this is not for the kiddies. There is only perhaps a couple mild profanities, (no more than Sherlock Holmes) and absolutely no sexual content. All in all a pretty clean film.

So what's my verdict? As a horror movie fan, I must say four and a half out of five stars. With this level of acting and the brilliant filmmaking, I must give this one a high rating.

Well-directed, atmospheric and creepy with all the right elements, this film is worth repeat viewings.  Things you didn't notice earlier are apt to appear a second time if you look closely.

heard of this movie. Can Daniel Radcliffe break from the Harry Potter character
he has portrayed for so long? Ladies and Gentleman after viewing the Woman in
Black I can safely say............Yes.

The effects in this movie are simple and practical; there wasn't much, if
 any, CG that I could see and I am very open to that. The effects work and they
 do their job in combination with the atmosphere of the movie to scare the
 freaking pants of you. The movie does not go for jump scares, also known as the
 ""OMG CAT"" scares, or if you are me, jump startles, but instead slowly
 builds it up and relying heavily on the atmosphere to scare you when the ghost
 does show its face. Part of the beauty is you never know for sure when the
 scares are coming.

I seriously cannot think of a single complaint I have with this movie.
 People looking for a high body count and gore for the sake of gore, you know
 like Saw, will not find it here. the movie relies on suspense to create fear in
 his audience. It scares you and creates a knot in your stomach that doesn't
 have to do with making you sick or disturbed from the amount of blood on
 screen. This is a different kind of horror movie, and it is one I hope to see
 more of because this genre hasn't seen a horror movie like this in a while.

4766069,4,B005LAIGOQ,"WOMAN IN BLACK is an eerie, atmospheric ghost story reminiscent of the Hammer films of the late fifties, early sixties.  No gore or overwrought violence, relying on its spooky storyline and moody frightening to propel its effect.
Daniel Radcliffe leaves Harry Potter behind as Arthur, a young attorney on the verge of losing his job and recovering from the death of his wife who died in childbirth.  Radcliffe has to carry the weight of the film and while not a totally convincing performance, he is committed and sincere and should have a promising career.
Ciaran Hinds offers his usual stalwart support and two-time Oscar nominee Janet McTeer is chilling in her brief role as Hinds' disturbed wife.
I liked Marco Beltrani's haunting score and the cinematography is extremely effective.

Both an earlier British TV film and the long-running London stage version outclass it in sheer chills. Less is always more in a ghost story, but in this THE WOMAN IN BLACK the reasoning seems to be ""If one wind-up Victorian toy is scary, seventeen of them will be terrifying!"" With apologies, no, it doesn't work that way. The central set-piece, Arthur's aural ""witnessing"" of a long-ago fatal carriage accident in the dangerous, all-encompassing and impenetrable mist of Eel Marsh is rushed through, but there is seemingly endless footage of a game but green Daniel Radcliffe wandering around the haunted mansion. The movie is way out of proportion, and the ending (SPOILER) seems to want to have it both ways, both gloom and happiness.

4766074,2,B005LAIGOQ,"Oh dear, they just cannot get this one to translate to film.

I love this play, I've seen it in London three times and really, there's no way to translate the brilliance of three actors, very sparse stage design and an old theater. The story is extremely simple and effective. The use of disturbing sound design and ONE ghost is used sparingly and with very creepy results. It works brilliantly and always sells out. I'm clearly biased. My bad.

The original movie isn't particularly creepy and this one is only slightly better. They should have kept this story pared down. The more superfluous embellishment you add onto a story like this, the more weighed down it becomes. I don't like the addition of the clairvoyant, a ressurected carriage, ghost children, or the body. It's all so unnecessary. An effective ghostly tale makes your mind wonder at what's in the dark? What are the motives, when and how will the next manifestation begin? You have to use more than just visual senses. Goading the imagination, sound and keeping the story tight are so important.

Anyway; great sets, costuming, acting: that kind of thing. If you're easily scared, like spooky or love Daniel then you may enjoy this.",1337731200,2,1200,4.815533980582524

4766138,4,B005LAIGOQ,"The reason for this is because Paranormal Activity (parts 1 - 3) relies of jump scares while this relies on four things, suspense, creepiness, disturbing imagery and good pacing.... Seriously, it had brilliant pacing, to tell you the truth, I didn't feel like watching the movie right away, but it was a fun way to start off my morning, in fact I felt like turning it off on account of me being tired but another superb thing about this movie is that it gets into the story right away!

Plot: Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliff) has already lost his wife and feels her presence everyday even when she is absent. 4 years after her death he is assigned to a house that is practically cut off from the remote town that sits next to it, in fear. There he will do some paper work and mumbo jumbo but, on his first day he soon realizes that something is wrong. It turns out that a spirit (a woman dressed in black) Is haunting the premises of the haunted house. Can Daniel Radcliff stop the terror or will he become another victim in the woman in black's scheme!

Review: I never heard of the original until I saw the first trailer back in late 2011 and unfortunately I haven't had the time to watch it but I hear it is chilling and scary as all hell! This movie was intense, but I do wish we saw more of the woman in black but when we did, let me tell ya... she wasn't pretty. In fact I am so sick and tired of witches that are pretty, we need a movie with an ugly witch, but we aren't technically talking about a witch, we are talking about a woman, a woman in black that just so happens to be a ghost! This film was never tame and one thing that it did have that paranormal activity also had was that feeling to look in back of whom ever you should be focusing on but instead your attention is drawn to the background and I feel that it is hard to do, especially when it is not shot entirely on a hand held camera!

Acting: It was just wonderful to see Daniel Radcliff in something besides an over-hyped wizard movie (and you know what I am talking about). His acting was pretty awesome but I just couldn't shake the feeling of him playing a father.... damnit, I've watched to much Harry Potter! The other actors were above average as well.... let's just say I was pleasantly surprised!

Gore: Some blood coughing and blood on a sheet is all we get here and I do wish it had more atmosphere like the first trailer gave off, but what we got was good enough!

Bottom Line: I believe that I have said everything that I wanted to about this movie. It was over decent but I still do adore insidious more because it is more of my taste!

The plot of The Woman in Black is pretty weak to begin with, and the film does nothing to add substance to Susan Hill's shallow tale in which the weather is the most interesting character of all. Radcliffe is unimpressive, and while he is good enough to portray the one-dimensional Harry Potter, as Arthur Kipps he simply goes around moping the entire movie, failing to make us believe in the supposed heartache he is experiencing.

On the production side, the film is well made; The cinematography sets a good atmosphere, and the house is perfectly creepy as the main location for the plot.

4766146,4,B005LAIGOQ,"The Woman in Black is a pretty traditional haunted house story that focuses on atmosphere and the lingering feeling of dread instead of CGI gore and horror. If you've read the book, you'll be familiar with the unsettling nature of the story - a general sense that translated well to the stage play and here to the film. The filming locations capture the remoteness of a house cut off by tide and tragedy and the general production design makes great use of a set to spring some fairly major jumps.

Daniel Radcliffe is well cast in bringing an innocence to a pretty dire situation where children keep dying every time the woman in black shows up, and he's clearly going to keep going beyond Harry Potter. The rest of the cast do well to portray the town that doesn't want Radcliffe there too. All of the tension and surprises rise from the situation and some clever camera shots and even the most hardened horror fan should get quite a few scares.

It's all a fairly solid production until the ending. Susan Hill's book transcended the genre with the end of her story (which has since been copied many times) but this movie doesn't stay faithful to the original material in an attempt to spare the audience the downer.

It was quite obvious that the people in town didn't want him there, but worse yet, there was much more to worry about than just feeling unwanted in the forbidden village. I highly recommend this classic goth story to all thriller and mystery lovers, who enjoy intense suspense throughout with fear and dread instilled from beginning to end. This dark mystery with its silent screams, ghosts and faces in windows will have you biting your nails right up until a shocking ending!

4766190,5,B005LAIGOQ,"There are two kinds of horror films.  The first depends for its scares on graphic gore, unrestrained violence, and blood -- lots of it.  The second relies more on mood and an escalating sense of terror than gruesome images to get under the skin.  ""The Woman in Black"" falls into the second category.  It's a film rich in atmosphere that takes its time getting underway but, once it kicks in, never lets go.

In pre-World War I England, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), a young London lawyer with a small son, is grieving over his dead wife.  His employer is fed up with Arthur's dour attitude and sends him to Yorkshire to handle the sale of an estate.  Arthur is warned that this will be his last chance to distinguish himself for the firm.

Arriving after a long journey, Arthur is met and befriended by a local squire, Daily (Ciaran Hinds), though the other townsfolk are not thrilled with the visit of an outsider.  Arthur is brought to the house of the deceased, which lies quite a distance from town.  It is the textbook example of the House of Gloom -- grey, run down, surrounded by overgrown shrubbery, broken gates marking its entrance -- a place that immediately foreshadows bad things to come.

For much of the movie, Arthur is alone in the house -- or is he?  Many of the trappings of a traditional ghost story are here -- the rainstorm, shadowy corridors, a dog barking at something not seen, an endless number of rooms, each with creepy and unsettling contents.  And then there are the sightings: a darkly attired female figure, a face at a window, a fresh handprint on a window, a corpse rising from a muddy grave.  Whether these are real or only figments of Arthur's imagination is left to speculation -- at least for a while.

""The Woman in Black"" is from Hammer Studios, famous for a series of highly profitable Technicolor horror films made between 1957 and the early 70's.  Those features always had great production values and good actors, giving them far more style than their competitors.  ""The Woman in Black"" is true to that tradition.  Instead of a collection of young and pretty 20-somethings who will be disposed of in messy ways, it boasts a first-rate cast.

Mr. Radcliffe's character is the focus of the movie and he is totally convincing as the lawyer hoping to make good while under a cloud of depression over the loss of his beloved wife.  He infuses his performance with a sad determination, as if he is running a track meet with his feet encased in cement blocks.  He forges on, knowing his livelihood depends on successfully delving through a myriad of papers, settling the estate, and seeing to the sale of the house.  Yet he misses his wife and the life they had together.  His Arthur Kipps is as far removed from Harry Potter as Hamlet is from the Nutty Professor.

Mr. Hinds's Squire Daily is on hand mostly to provide balance to the inhospitable townsfolk, who would be equally at home carrying torches up a hill in a Frankenstein movie.  He prides himself on not being superstitious and refuses to believe the many deaths of children in town are anything more than unfortunate coincidence.  He also provides some exposition, filling us in on what happened in that gloomy house and why Arthur will undoubtedly fail to find a local buyer.  Hinds has a patrician look and never smiles. He suggests a careworn aristocrat who has seen much and prefers to trust his senses to belief in the otherworldly.

Janet McTeer appears briefly, but unforgettably, as Mrs. Daily, a woman who is either an amusing eccentric or a looney, depending on how you interpret her actions.  Ms. McTeer adds bizarre contrast to a film in which the expression of choice appears to be glumness.  Dressed in frills and smiling pleasantly, she enjoys hosting Arthur for dinner.  It's not until we see some of her odd habits that we realize she may have a few cards missing from her deck.

Director James Watkins has fashioned an entertaining horror film.  It's the kind of movie those who are turned off by bloody mayhem can embrace, since it's more about dread and terror than horror.  We experience the house and its history through the eyes of Arthur Kipps.  Watkins knows how to use sound and silence to enhance mood.  Long stretches of silence will precede a loud noise that will make us jump, but those stretches of silence are filled with suspense and anticipation.  We know that something -- anything -- might happen unexpectedly.

Ample credit must be given to those responsible for the film's creepy milieu.  Art director Paul Ghirardani, production designer Kave Quinn, and set decorator Niamh Coulter have decorated every nook and cranny of the old manor house with Victorian furnishings, faded paintings, large carved cabinets, countless  candles, cobwebs, and eerie old wind-up toys.  One can almost smell the mustiness.

Rated PG-13, ""The Woman in Black"" takes itself seriously and never resorts to self-deprecation.  The characters behave intelligently and have actual motivations.  It is in the league of Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"" or Robert Wise's creaky-old-house melodrama, ""The Haunting.""  Like those earlier films, it shows what happens when a person is confronted with the supernatural and reality seems to spin wildly out of control.",1337212800,264,5272,4.821826280623608
4766191,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Hammer Films, well known in the past for their Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee Dracula films, returns with Woman in Black (also see the excellent home adaptation for TV, if you get a chance), starring Harry Potter's lead actor, Radcliffe, who plays a real estate agent sent in to collect the papers of a deceased old woman, who died in her mansion in the middle of a wide open marshland.

The tide rolls in as our lead investigates the hell house, and experiences many chilling moments, leading to a boiling finale that will make the hair stand on the back of your neck as only any horrific sequence of images and sound can do.

Many frightful moments build the tension as Arthur grudgingly explores this hellish home of the dead woman, with an ominous, evil presence determined to end the lives of any one foolish enough to trespass. A well told, building horror tale not to be missed by any fan of haunted ghost movies. Many dark, very disturbing moments abound.

If you love the old hitchcock and tales from the crypt-type shows, this is the one for you.  Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) had lost his wife during childbirth a few years prior.  He must leave his child behind with a nanny in order to sort out a deceased client's copious amount of paperwork at her house.  The house and grounds are haunted by the deceased.  The fury of losing her young child while she was living remains with her in death; so she wreaks vengeance on the community as a ghost.

The acting is superb and the effects are chilling.  I was so excited that they gave Daniel Radcliffe a chance to break free of the Harry Potter mold...and boy did he ever deliver.  Wonderfully done.  I highly recommend it.  Caution with children under the age of 13 due to disturbing images and intense creepiness.",1335916800,6,919,4.475903614457831

I thought the pop-out scares were decent but the storyline is what I thought made the movie superb.

The woman haunting the house is not the drowned child's mother. The haunting was going on, before the child ever drowned. The Woman In Black was in the photo taken of the family, while the child was still alive. She is in the background, in one of the windows. The drowned child is one of her victims! We do not know who the woman is or why she has cursed the village, as far as I can tell. The movie is different than the book. There has to be a reason why the children must die, when the woman has been seen. A taken and then drowned child makes absolutely no sense, as being the reason. The woman tried to let our hero know that the parents in the photo were not in any way involved, by scratching their faces off. The woman was enraged, when our hero left the boy's body on the bed, and did not solve the mystery. She, obviously, wanted his help. To do what, I just don't know, but there is something much more sinister behind this tale. She did not need or want the body of the child. Our hero missed the whole point.
The village has been cursed, for something that happened long before the boy drowned.

4766297,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I love gothic horror -- big cobwebbed houses, squawking ravens, rolling mists and mysterious sinister figures that are only glimpsed. ""The Woman in Black"" has all of those. In fact, this slow, haunting movie loads on the Edwardian ghost-story atmosphere so thick that it practically chokes you -- and while it tends to move slowly, it's beautifully creepy.

Young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) has a life in tatters -- his career is in jeopardy, and he's still in mourning over the loss of his wife four years ago. He's sent to sort through the personal effects of Alice Drablow, who left behind a decayed mansion set in the misty marshes -- and when visiting the house, he sees a veiled woman in black.

The locals are also desperate to get rid of him, even blaming him for the death of a child who drank lye. And soon Kipps begins to understand why, as he unravels the secrets of the Drablow family, and the madwoman who lost her child long ago. With the help of his new friend Sam Daily (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds),  Kipps will set out to stop the Woman in Black before she claims what's dearest to him.

I haven't been too impressed with the output of the revitalized Hammer Films company. ""The Woman in Black"" is probably the best horror movie they've produced -- it feels like a modern version of their shadowy, gothic old movies. It's also not very scary, although director James Watkins tosses in a few jump scares (a raven, a faucet, etc).

Instead, the movie just makes you uneasy. We're constantly aware that SOMETHING is hovering over this town. But for most of the movie, we only see fleeting glimpses of the Woman and her power.

The biggest problem is that the movie moves rather slowly, especially in the first half. But for me, it's compensated for by Watkins inserting some truly unnerving scenes, like a hysterical Mrs. Daily carving into the table. And the gothic atmosphere is so heavy and dark that it practically drips from the screen -- vast mildewed houses, foggy marshes, half-forgotten letters and old photos, and a grey rainy light that seems to wash the colors from the world.

There's not a trace of Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe's performance here. His Arthur Kipps is a haunted, broken figure who seems strangely detached from the world around him, except when it comes to endangered children. The only problem is that Radcliffe looks a little young for the role -- whenever Arthur is with his little son, he looks more like the kid's big brother.

""The Woman in Black"" is rather slow at times, but the gothic atmosphere and a strong performance from Radcliffe almost make up for that. Well, I'll gladly take it over rotten slasher remakes.",1332720000,98,2678,4.707264957264957
4766298,3,B005LAIGOQ,"Of all the Harry Potter alumni, Daniel Radcliffe is probably in the most tenuous position now that the blockbuster franchise has ended it's decade long run. He's dabbled in other projects outside of the boy wizard's adventures before, and has generally shown to be a talented and more than capable actor. But he's also most likely to be pigeonholed, with people unable to accept him as anything other than a kid with a magic wand and pet owl. Even so, he's still in a better position than poor Rupert Grint. So what's the best decision Radcliffe can make? To star in another film that has him dealing with big houses and supernatural forces. Probably not the wisest move, and his Harry Potter fans who follow him into the tedious The Woman in Black may start wishing for someone to cast a spell and speed up time.

Based on a Susan Collin's dreary but effective novel, the deliberate pacing is one that plays out better on the printed page than on screen. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a gloomy lawyer struggling to cope with the death of his wife, who passed tragically years earlier after giving birth to their son. Arthur apparently hasn't smiled since, so much so that his son draws depressing pictures of his Dad(to comical effect). His demeanor is so bleak that Arthur is on the verge of losing his job. Nobody wants a stick in the mud as a colleague. Given one last shot to redeem himself, he's sent to the depressing village of Yorkshire to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman.

Upon arriving, it's pretty clear nobody wants him there, and the reason has to do with the woman's creaky old home, which as you probably suspected is plagued by an evil spirit. Aren't they all? In this case it's of a woman, wronged in life and separated forever from her dead son. As retribution, her malevolence has plagued the entire village's children, and the streets are littered with the ghosts of her victims who stare blankly out of windows and hang around the woods like creepy stalkers. The town itself is little more than a mudpit with a bit of smog surrounding it, but it's like heaven compared to the house itself, which is full of every horror cliche in the book. Creepy marionettes that look extra spooky in the dark, the type no parent would ever buy their child. Every corner is a blind hazard, every step another rickety shriek of worn out wood, and behind every door lies the possibility of a vengeful poltergeist. Shutters flap, people knock on the door at the most fearful moments. Let's just say that Arthur doesn't get a lot of work done.

Radcliffe may seem like an odd choice to play a grieving widower, but he proves to be the film's greatest asset. His youthful features appear appropriately hardened by years of overwhelming grief, and you can tell his every action is labored by life's meaninglessness. But when faced with immediate danger, some of the old Harry Potter spirit comes through. In contrast to the rest of the cast, including veteran actor Ciaran Hinds, Radcliffe is the only one who seems to be bringing everything he has to what is a very understated role.

It's just unfortunate that so much of the film is completely conventional. Despite director James Watkins' skillful depiction of smog and soot filled Victorian England, the script by the usually reliable Jane Goldman doesn't take us anywhere we haven't been. Atmosphere can only get you so far, and some of the film's old school horror charms wear thin from overuse. How many times are we expected to leap from our seats at a close-up of a toy monkey? Without genuine scares, the glacial pace becomes an even bigger problem. Watching both chapters of Deathly Hallows feels more brisk than this film's plodding 90 minutes.",1332374400,,3730,4.707503828483921

It was a good horror movie! It wasn't filled with gore and faux-blood spillage everywhere, but it was scary and perfect to bring girlfriends (but prepare for high pitched shrieks)!

I brought my brother along and he thought it was very scary! And he's a horror movie buff! Just for the record, my brother wasn't cowering in a corner, he meant 'scary' as in 'well-done' for a horror movie.

That being said, none of the scares were new ones, but they were very effectively used and that's better than most horror movies and movies in general.

The acting was great; the cinematography was great, it was both beautiful and desolate on Isle Marsh; the spooks weren't original but well-done.

The clothes were amazing. Daniel Radcliffe should wear something like this all of the time and he will never have to worry about going home alone ever again.

It felt like a short movie, which is great because I think it's close to two hours long.

4766303,4,B005LAIGOQ,"I saw the prior 1989 film of this book made by British tv.  I've read the book.  I've heard it performed as an audio book.  I haven't seen the stage play of it.  This work thus exists in many, many forms and is very popular in almost all of them.

This time the movie had a very lavish budget and starred Daniel Radcliffe as the lead. As a solicitor, he is called in to visit a distant village in order to settle an estate.  There he sees a ghost of a woman wearing funereal black. She is furious at everyone because her son drowned on the marsh and no one even bothered to dig up his body.  They are scared to death of her because certain disaster looms every time she makes an appearance. Sure enough disasters start to take place with the first one being a young girl who falls into his arms at the police station because she just drank lye.

There is a bit of a rewrite on this version of the film towards the end. It resolves the ghost story more than it has been resolved in any other incarnation.  I am not sure that this is needed or necessary.  It does not ruin it though.

It is a very good ghost movie.  It is scary.  The visual effects are great. However, I can't give it the 5 stars I gave the 1989 version.  That version, with a fraction of the budget, scared me so much that I was turning on lights, keeping my dog nearby and such whenever I was alone in the house. This version does not have that kind of horror punch, It seems the scariest movies often are made on a small budget.  Perhaps the lavish special effects make us too aware that it is a movie.

Radcliffe does a fine job.  He is a fine young actor but then again he has been since he was a small boy. I think he will do fine now that the Potter films are over and he is no longer Harry Potter to us.  He is beginning to look less and less like Harry Potter which should help.

4766304,4,B005LAIGOQ,"The movie hits on all the classic stereotypes of a ghost story. There is a haunted mansion in an isolated marsh thick with fog. There is a past of a haunted suicide and a recent will. The village has a secret. The house has ghostly images, squeaks, creaks, whispers, things that move on their own, and a raven that enters it.

Our main character has a wife who has died in child birth and for some undisclosed reason this is his ""last chance"" with his firm so he just can't walk away. In the beginning, Radcliffe wears his hair down over his forehead leading me to suspect he really does have a permanent mark in the shape of a lightning bolt.

There is a mystery that is supposed to draw you in, but having seen so many clich&eacute;s you wonder if this film will offer you anything new.

As the poorly developed Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe) sorts through the papers in the house he uncovers letters which sheds some light unto the situation, and we get to see his bolt free forehead. Radcliffe was neither an asset nor a liability. His agent did him well, but I thought he mustered more fear and terror as that Potter guy in the late sequels than he did in this film. He seems to have trouble with convincing facial expressions.

The strength of the film is in how well it utilizes all those haunted mansion clich&eacute;s, the lighting...or lack of it, and the detailing of the era. Arthur is played as a rather dull character. There are things that happen to him which would have made me leap out of skin and run out the house, yet he does very little. Also Arthur is quiet as he encounters the unknown, perhaps done to build up the scare factor, but I wonder how that would have worked with a character who talks to the ghost while searching about, maybe with a comical line or two taken from ""Hold That Ghost"" or someone like Joe Pesci swearing obscenities at it.

4766306,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Forget all the nonsense surrounding this being Daniel Radcliffe's first film outside of the mega franchise that is Harry Potter. Yes Radcliffe is in the movie and does a serviceable job in the role of Arthur Kipps but everything to me exists out of Radcliffe and to speak of him does disservice to the best component of the movie, that being James Watkins the director who creates and excellent amount of suspense over trying to use musical stings or jump scares to hit his audience. This isn't a classic haunted house film like Robert Wise's The Haunting or The Shining but its a fun little film with a flaw holding it back from greatness.
I mention Radcliffe only in saying that every actor in the film outside of acting talent which they have seems more to have been cast for their faces. Its odd seeing Radcliffe playing a father sure, but Kipps isn't a character like Jack Torrance. Radcliffe main use in the film is to either appear haunted or scared which He does well. He's joined by the excellent Ciaran Hinds playing a local landowner who doesn't believe all this woman in black nonsense despite having a mentally unstable wife played by Janet Mcteer.
The Woman in Black herself is a beautiful creation, a ethereal image that plays like English Freddy Krueger, a vengeful spirit who causes the death of children when she's seen in the town of Crythin Gifford, gathering the spirits of her victims around her as sort of a haunting troupe.
As I said the real star of the film is James Watkins not to take anything from the work of the cinematographer or production designer. Watkins does pepper the film with jump scares from the Woman's screech to a bird in a chimney but He also tries the approach of John Carpenter in Halloween with hidden glimpses of the woman over the shoulder of a character or moments of an agitated dog to signal her coming. The film does use sound to create more measured bits of suspense included a bit lifted Susan Hill's novel involving a rocking chair behind a locked room and it works well. Then there's the house on Eel Marsh itself is a beautiful creation in keeping with the period setting of the film, a reclusive decaying mansion surrounded by marshes and a tide that cuts it off from town in order to strand Radcliffe.
It all adds up to a really good horror film, one with a dark edge to its action and one worth seeing in theatres to get the experience from the sights and sounds created to drive the suspense. There's just one true negative for me and that's the ending of the movie perhaps put in the film for Radcliffe's star power, or perhaps the result of negative testing. Hopefully not spoiling the end at one point the movie seems to go for a dark ending only to have some bit of happy schmaltz that tries to lighten the mood and doesn't work at all. Watkins previous film Eden Lake contained a twisted bit of glumness in its finale so it feels like something to fit with the fact that the movie has Harry Potter in the lead. Thankfully though for me one minute of blandness didn't kill a great ninety minutes that preceded it.
The disc from Sony Pictures doesn't have much in the way of great extras for fans of the film relying on an EPK making of and a bit about Daniel Radcliffe. Susan Hill pops up for a bit in the making of but the best bit bonus is a commentary from Watkins and Jane Goldman. What the disc has going for it is a superb audio visual package that works for the film. As I've said this beautiful looking ghost film where most of what drives the film are the images and the sound. Sure you could make a game out of all the scary sounds that are trotted out but there are other moments like a scene in a bog covered in fog that work well.
For fans of gothic horror films and ghost stories this is a recommended disc an excellent highlight for the format.",1329177600,4,3827,4.4297872340425535
4766347,4,B005LAIGOQ,"In ""The Woman in Black"" Daniel Radcliffe, otherwise immortalized as Harry Potter, plays Arthur Kipps, a struggling lawyer, on his last ditch assignment from his law firm to settle the estate of a friendless old widow. He leaves his 4-year old son behind for four days to travel to a remote village called Crythin Gifford, UK. Once there, he finds himself unknowingly walking into a legend and a legacy of tragedy and unexplained events that have had a stranglehold on the village for decades.

The first thing to be said about ""The Woman in Black"" and its star, Daniel Radcliffe, is that this was a brilliant move by him as an actor to do something so quickly after the Harry Potter series came to a close, and something so different as well. Never once while watching this movie did I think about Harry Potter. Radcliffe may be one of the few actors who has become so well known for one character that will be able to make the transition into other things.

""The Woman in Black"" is a remake of a successful television movie that came out in 1989. It is a ghost story, pure and simple, although, it is not simply described as a ghost story, because there is so much more to it than that. It isn't for the viewer looking for gratuitous violence. Maybe its greatest asset as a movie is its ability to turn ghost story in to mystery, slowly walking you through a haunting situation and revealing the secrets behind the strange happenings a little as a time, just as Arthur Kipps is discovering them.

The villagers are opposed to Arthur Kipps visiting the mysterious house across the vast marshlands and Kipps soon finds out why. He is quickly greeted to a mystery and a story that holds the audience in place and never lets up. The movie is never slow and always interesting. Yet at times, some of the things that move the story along can be considered a little hokey, but that placed aside, the mood and delivery are effective.

""The Woman in Black"" is a campfire tale and a campfire tale at its finest. It is a successful leap for Radcliffe who is trying to separate himself from being Harry Potter, and it is certainly a movie that will keep your eyes wide open because the things that haunt the mysterious house are not shy.",1329177600,5,2226,4.516129032258065
4766348,4,B005LAIGOQ,"*A Brief Note to Readers: If you find this review ""not helpful"", please take a moment to tell me why in the comment section. Thank you.*

Stories about vengeful spirits never fail to fascinate, and during one of the bleakest months of the year, the release of ""The Woman In Black"" is welcome entertainment for a bored and mostly housebound populace.  Adapted from a horror fiction novel originally published in 1983, author Susan Hill's tale comes to life on screen, raising hairs on the backs of audiences' necks in new and disturbing ways.

Arthur Kipps is a sad man.  Even his four-year old son Joseph draws pictures of him with frowns.  His melancholy stems from the loss of his wife Stella, the joy of their son's birth forever marred by her death after a difficult labor and delivery.  So when the law firm under which he is employed assigns him to the estate of one Alice Drablow, it is a convenient distraction and a solution to recent financial troubles.  Surmising he can put her affairs in order in just a few days time, he surpasses his deadline after encountering horrendous piles of disorganized papers as well as strange sounds and voices within Eel Marsh House, Drablow's former home.  Things quickly go from bad to worse when Arthur begins seeing a woman in a black dress in the house and on the grounds, the deaths of several children coinciding with her appearances. Faced with angry, superstitious townspeople and an unraveling mystery, Arthur's problems, once inconsequential, become the stuff of nightmares.

""The Woman In Black"" is, in a word, creepy, director James Watkins achieving the tale's ubiquitous gloom in many ways.  The archaic town that Arthur visits is comprised of dank and mossy stone structures populated by frowning denizens.  Costumes are simple and drab, moors are perpetually misty, the marshland is black and oily, and the film is punctuated by lots of beauteous stills of a roiling gray sea.  Porcelain dolls and tattered antique toys are always good for upping the creep factor and Watkins utilizes them to full effect, their wide glassy eyes engulfing the camera lens, unsettling the viewer with their unblinking and penetrating stares.  The foreboding of Eel Marsh House comes to life, its creaky floorboards, dirty and faded wallpaper, and cobwebs adorning every picture, chandelier and wall sconce sure to thrill fans of Susan Hill's novel.  What will make the biggest impression, of course, is the incarnation of the restless and vengeful spirit of the movie's title, one that slinks through the shadows in the background, whose raspy breaths reverberate through the hallways and rafters, and whose dark silhouette comes skulking (sometimes shrieking) out of the darkness time and time again.

With the exception of its star player and fellow Harry Potter alumnus Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, the movie is cast with actors largely unknown to American audiences.  Radcliffe, in his first role since the conclusion of the Harry Potter series, could have been judged on his potential as a leading man but the role of Arthur Kipps doesn't allow him to exhibit his range.  He is instead restricted to long somber gazes and a handful of moments of wide-eyed terror, a performance in favor with the film's ambiance and tempo.  The supporting players are on par with their A-list co-star, Hinds the biggest standout for his affecting portrayal of Sam Daily, a man whose life has been torn apart in more ways than one after the untimely death of his young son Nicolas.

As with most films of its ilk, ""The Woman In Black"" has its share of scares, the amalgam of music, sound effects, and on-screen action creating moments that make the audience jump out of their seats in fright.  Thankfully Watkins doesn't overdo it, his translation of Hill's tale doing most of the hair-raising work.  It is an admirable adaptation, though I'm sure some readers will take issue with the changes that have been made, the finale in particular.  If you haven't read Hill's novel (I didn't) and love a good ghost story, it's recommended.  If you have read the book and you often find that adaptations of books you've read don't meet your expectations, you're better off passing this one up or at least waiting until it's available on home video.",1329091200,3,4262,4.93006993006993
4766349,5,B005LAIGOQ,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to say a few things about this movie...

The Woman In Black (2012) is a remake of the 1989 TV movie of the same name and based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill.  I reviewed that movie last July and gave it 4 stars.  This remake is actually better than the original, a rare feat.  From my experience, usually remakes of horror movies are nowhere near as good as the original.  This is an exception.

The things that this movie have going for it are the dark, chilling, spooky atmosphere and the genuine creepiness of the haunted house from the Victorian era.  You'll see classic components of a haunted house - cobwebs, paintings hanging on the walls, lit candles, a rocking chair rocking by itself, creepy looking dolls, music box melodies, and of course ghosts.  Throw in the thunderstorm and the movie feels complete.  This is definitely one of the creepiest and best ghost story movies I've ever seen.  There are a lot of sudden scares that might make you jump out of your seat.  There is an occasional dose of comic relief sprinkled throughout the movie.  The musical score by Marco Beltrami is decent.

This movie was my introduction to Daniel Radcliffe (I've never seen the Harry Potter movies).  He does a commendable job acting.  This movie is a triumphant return for Hammer Horror.  Who can forget the classic Hammer horror movies from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s?

Overall, this is a good Victorian ghost story that I highly recommend.",1329004800,17,1511,4.637735849056604
4766350,5,B005LAIGOQ,"You have to be in the mood for a good, authentically creepy ghost story to fully enjoy the quiet chills of THE WOMAN IN BLACK. It's only after the story ended that I realized I'd been taken by something I should have seen from the beginning. At any rate, the ending did come as a twist for me--but in view of all the preceding events, it was indeed foreshadowed by information given about the title character.

Daniel Radcliffe has to carry the weight of most of the film on his own shoulders and he does a very strong and satisfying job as a young lawyer whose firm sends him on a mission to a remote village accessible only when the tide is low enough to permit horse and carriage to enter. The story depends on the musty atmosphere of a decaying mansion full of shopworn dolls that seem to come to life in a nursery where three girls met their fate years ago.

Radcliffe's only friendly neighbor is Ciaran Hinds, who helps him get to the root of the troubled village and the death of numerous young children. The extremes to which Radcliffe is willing to go (as in the marsh scene where he recovers a dead boy's body) are improbable, to say the least, but so graphically enacted that you have to believe it. It's one of the most suspenseful moments in the story. Radcliffe is willing to recover the corpse to give it a proper burial next to the mother, whose spirit is evidently haunting the old mansion.

The surprise ending fits the story but came as quite a shock to me, although with hindsight I can see that there was some preparation for it if you paid close attention to the script.

For lovers of Gothic tales full of mist, suspicion, brooding townspeople and dangerous marshlands, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is your ticket. Good production values are in abundant evidence. Hammer is certainly making a good comeback in the horror genre with this delicious ghost story. Fine cinematography is another big asset.

Radcliffe makes expressive use of his penetrating blue eyes framed by bushy brows that confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future.",1328659200,15,2064,4.582655826558265
4766351,4,B005LAIGOQ,"In the early 1900s, young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a remote village to go through the papers of a recently deceased old woman. He finds the villagers oddly hostile, but sets about his work in the woman's creepy, old house. There, he begins to unravel the story of a mysterious woman believed to haunt the place.

 If you're looking for a scary movie, look no further. There are scares every few minutes once Arthur starts (stupidly) exploring the house, endlessly going from dark room to dark room while the eerie music and sound effects build to get-ready-to-shriek-levels. The movie has little dialogue, with Arthur alone most of the time just looking for the ghost.

This kind of alone-in-the-house part is usually played by a beautiful, helpless, young woman but Radcliffe does a good job, coming off as serious, mature, and fairly brave. If you saw the movie without sound, it wouldn't be nearly as frightening, so a great deal of credit must go to the music and sound effects. Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is good in a rather undemanding, supporting role. The titular character disappointingly resembles a mannequin in a high school haunted house.

The movie makes the most out of people' primal fear of the dark and genuine shocks come on a regular (one might say, predictable) basis. I found the movie just a bit unsatisfying, though, because Arthur's character is so wooden and stoic and the story is unrelentingly unpleasant. 3.5 stars.",1328572800,3,1462,4.930894308943089
4766352,4,B005LAIGOQ,I took by three nieces to see this movie and was very surprised as to how good it was.  I went in with an open mind with no knowledge of what the movie was about and I really enjoyed it.  My youngest niece was the one who enjoyed it the most as it was scarry to her.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting a quick entertaining experience.  Never a dull moment during the film.  Always something happening.,1328572800,,416,4.215189873417722
4766353,4,B005LAIGOQ,"To tell the truth, I'm not really a fan of the horror genre, excluding the classic Universal monster films from the 20's and 30'; but especially not modern horror, with people being tortured and slashed to ribbons and all that (why so many people seem to love that stuff is beyond me). That being said, I found ""The Woman in Black"" to be a masterpiece of Gothic horror, simply overflowing with psychological terror and creepiness; in short, an old-fashioned ghost story for the 21st century.

Susan Hill's wonderfully atmospheric novel is what sold me on the idea of this film in the first place. Before that, I could have easily passed this off as just another disgusting horror movie under the guise of a ghost story. The film's production company, Hammer, was best known throughout the 50's and 60's for producing genuinely scary horror films with lots of gore and blood. With the company's decline in the 1980's, it seemed that they, like so many other studios, would just go out of business, but in 2008, they were revived. ""The Woman in Black"" is the first ghost story that they have ever produced, and for their first supernatural outing, they didn't do too shabby.

Moody and foreboding from the very first scene, the story concerns Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer from London who is sent by his firm to the rural Yorkshire town of Crythin Gifford with the purpose of settling the estate of a recently deceased client, Mrs. Alice Drablow. From the first moment he arrives there is a sense that something sinister is going to happen: The village is separated from the mainland by a causeway which floods over at high tide, and the house itself, Eel Marsh house, is surrounded by a mysterious bog that holds many secrets, some darker than others. As he catches his first glimpses of the woman in black herself, children in the village begin dying violent and unexpected deaths, caused by apparent suicide. Arthur's job suddenly takes a more serious turn as he begins to uncover the secret behind the mysterious hauntings and the true identity of the one woman who seems to be behind it all.

While I found several additions by screenwriter Jane Goldman to be a little wanton (Zombie children wandering the marshes, two very graphic death scenes, a ghostly reenactment of a suicide, some very creepy Victorian wind-up toys, and a rather mad Mrs. Daily who rears her two pet Chihuahuas like children and claims to channel the spirit of her dead son), the film stays very true to the Hill's book and faithfully brings that same unsettling, suspenseful atmosphere to the big screen. There is no doubt for fans of the novel that this is the definitive adaptation, far surpassing the 1989 BBC version.

Perfectly evoking the flavor of the old dark house pictures from glory days of cinematic horror, it's a great example of what all good ghost stories should have: things that bump, creak and rock for no apparent reason, flitting shadows, flickering candles, bone-chilling shrieks, and enough thrills and jump-scares to keep you leaping from you seat whether you want to or not. As the film progresses, the scares keep building, so that by the time you get to the real chills, you're so worked up from anticipating what's coming that you are, to put it mildly, scared right out of your wits.  A handful of scenes aside, this film is wonderfully old-fashioned in its simplicity, psychological effectiveness, and lack of gore. The real scares are built on our fears of the unknown and the fact that what you can't see or don't know is oftentimes scarier than what you can. Sure, there are some really creepy things that you'd have to be blind as a bat to miss, but I find that the moments of almost oppressive silence are the most nerve-wracking of all, a good example being early on in the film when Arthur is exploring the house, alone -- no dialogue, no screams -- just the nail-biting experience of not knowing what's going to be around the next corner. The fact that this is so frightening is even more amazing when you realize that most of this sequence takes place in broad daylight!

Shot in a predominantly monochrome color palette of dusty greys and dreary blacks, visually, it is one of the most stunning films I have seen in a long time. The colors, or lack of them, go a long way into creating a bleak and brooding atmosphere to stage the story and perfectly enhance the inherent creepiness of the film itself. Even the style in which it was filmed, most noticeable in the scene described above, is quite scary: It puts you right into the character's shoes, and makes for a very visceral and haunting theatrical experience.

Being a relatively low-budget film, director James Watkins chose to rely mainly on ""in-camera"" effects rather than touching up scenes with massive amounts of CGI, which aside from being costly also looks phony if thrown in too often. I'd have to guess that about 80% of what you see on-screen was what was actually filmed then and there, not added in later with a computer. This decision definitely adds realism, something not usually found in horror movies, and doesn't cause you to keep drawing yourself out of the film to think ""Oh, they did that with special effects,"".

One thing that sets ""Woman"" apart from just about every other scary movie I've seen is that it is incredibly character driven. It isn't just about the scares; it's about the people, too. I find that when you truly care about those involved, you subconsciously invest a lot more in them emotionally, so that whenever tragedies befall them, it hits you that much harder because of it. I guess you could say there is an equal measure of horror and heart, something that doesn't pop up very often in this particular genre.

While I've been impressed by Daniel Radcliffe's acting abilities in the past, here, he proves that he is well able to emerge from Harry Potter's shadow and handle other, quite different roles. He's not known for taking on easy parts, and for his first post-Potter film, this is about as difficult as you could manage. A 24-year-old widower with a young child, grieving to the point of obsession over his wife who died in childbirth and who is about to lose his job if he fails to make good on his current case is a daunting enough task for an older, more experienced actor, let alone someone who is only 21! There is no one else I could picture playing Arthur Kipps half so well, managing expertly to portray the sober, almost haunted quality of a man suffering unbearable pain and carrying responsibilities far beyond his years through mostly facial expressions and gestures.

The supporting cast is all very well chosen, especially Ciarn Hinds as Samuel Daily, Liz White as the Woman in Black, and Daniel Radcliffe's real-life godson Misha Handley as Arthur's son, Joseph.

The ending, which is different from both the book and the TV adaptation, has a twist that even I didn't foresee, and is either good or bad, depending on how you look at it. I personally feel that it was the only way they could have given the film closure, seeing as how they altered Arthur's back-story from the original novel. The only thing that I really found fault with was the new twist concerning Nathaniel Drablow and Eel Marsh House, which totally puts at odds the idea of the Woman in Black and her vengeful curse in the first place.

Overall, after viewing ""The Woman in Black"", I'm still not a fan of horror, but I enjoyed this film because of the strong emotional core and non-stop thriller aspect. I'll certainly be purchasing the DVD to watch around Halloween, when settling down for a night of fright is far more appropriate!",1328486400,4,7645,4.718352059925094
4766354,3,B005LAIGOQ,"The Woman in Black is a decent ghost story, but don't expect too much. A couple of loud noise jump scares. Harry Potter does prove that he can carry a film on his own. The atmosphere and set design are top notch, but the simple story is a been there done that. It is worthy of a rental, but check out The Changeling (1980) for some really creepy scares.",1328486400,,353,4.130434782608695
4766355,4,B005LAIGOQ,"Forget Harry Potter when you watch The Woman in Black. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Daniel Radcliffe is struggling not to be typecast, to establish himself as an adult actor, not an easy accomplishment for any child star. Radcliffe does a creditable job in this movie. A classic, gothic horror story, it contains scary elements without resorting to the gory, shlocky slasher stuff of recent decades. As Arthur Kipps, the young lawyer devastated by his wife's childbed death, he has little to do other than to act wary and frightened, and appear foolhardy enough to go where no sane person ever would. This film has many strengths, among them the perfect dark, eerie sets, the cinematography that lends a sense of black and white to what is actually a color production, and enough of a mystery to make the viewer wonder what's going on in the forbidding town to which Arthur is sent to work. Along with him, we figure out, step by step, exactly what motivates the black veiled apparition, and along with him, we trust that he'll be able to put her to rest.

But there are weaknesses as well. It becomes a bit tiresome to follow Arthur through the dismal corridors of the haunted mansion, armed as he is with only a candle and an axe. Too much reliance is placed upon the sudden shocking revelation, which the audience learns to anticipate. The most effective scene takes place outside the estate, at a family crypt where Arthur encounters the distraught mother of a dead child. Most of the supporting actors have little to do other than to look forbidding and threatening, but Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer are superb in there roles as the grieving couple who, alone amongst their neighbors, offer some support to Arthur. The ending is a true shocker.

As is typical, the screenplay is substantially different from the novel upon which it is based, so watch the movie as a separate entity. It's worth a look. I needed a drink to settle down afterwards!",1328486400,168,1966,4.695652173913044
4766356,5,B005LAIGOQ,"What a cheering prospect: two great institutions of British supernatural cinema making a good show of not being stone dead after all.

Latterly consensus had it that Hammer Film Productions, having introduced the post war generation to spanky gothic horror, was a long time deceased, wiped off the map thirty years ago by the Americans and their ghastly slasher franchises (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B005D7E80S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nightmare-On-Elm-Street/dp/B0058N2T3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nightmare On Elm Street</a>), which left nothing to the imagination, and nary a haunted cupboard for poor old Hammer to hide in.

Hammer's was always a distinctly British pleasure: campy gothic mansions, busty English virgins floundering wantonly at the hands of glowering gentlemen vampires and tension ratcheted by a heady collection of instantly recognisable tropes: bumps in the night, creaking staircases, candlesticks, quavering gas lamps and pale, cassocked children with faraway stares wandering menacingly in and out of the frame, all girdled with a patina of sauciness.

An increasingly thick patina as the years wore on: Just as Freddy Kruger was firing up the chainsaws and breaking out the hockey mask, Hammer was tipping into Carry-On territory. I don't think Syd James appeared in a Hammer horror, but he convincingly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/spoofed-one/dp/B003XF1V0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">spoofed one</a>, and you fancy he might have turned in a memorably lecherous Van Helsing had the dice rolled differently. Not long afterward, Hammer folded.

All the same, Hammer remains a grand if not exactly solemn pilaster on the frontage of Britain's cinema history. There's an argument (which I may have just invented) that even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B003ZSJ212/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;owes a debt to Hammer: Princess Leia, Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin are archetypes which may as well have been lifted straight out of the Hammer playbook. David Prowse, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were longstanding Hammer alumni.

Thirty years or so later, it seems, like its own ghoulish progeny, that Hammer cannot die. Indeed, it seems in rude health, if its new production The Woman In Black is anything to go by.

The film delivers all the old Hammer features in spades. And candles, self-rocking chairs, overgrown moonlit graveyards and macabre clockwork dolls. If I had to point up a reservation, I would say it was short a fruity Susannah York in a rippable bodice - but otherwise it nails the Hammer idiom for the twenty-first century.

Effective and (mostly) discrete employment of CGI bestows the Woman in Black a gorgeous, stylish look, and the production design is magnificent, from the dark panelled offices from which struggling articled clerk Arthur Kipps is dispatched to the provinces, Jonathan Harker-style, to sort out the papers of a deceased lady's estate, to the majestic tidal sweep out to her mansion perched on a rock resembling St. Michael's Mount and as joyously gothic as any haunted house you'll ever see.

Now I mentioned the continued prosperity of two great British cinematic institutions: the other, of course, is the beloved boy wizard Daniel Radcliffe, played to such memorable effect in the eponymous film franchise by young Harry Potter.

Few film fans haven't fretted about Potter's chances of escaping the Radcliffe typecast. It is a weighty burden indeed to have played such a definitive character so early in one's career. These first post-Radcliffe films are a make or break for Potter's prospects of cinematic longevity.

In that regard, The Woman In Black is both a good and a bad choice.

Bad in that, being set in an up-country Gothic pile and having a supernatural context, it is hard not to read in some of the Hogwarts idiom: that Arthur Kipps reaches it aboard a steam train from King's Cross seems almost intentionally referential.

Good, though, in that the Hammer style relies for its impact mostly on its direction, staging, lighting, editing, sound and production design: almost anything but acting. The film requires little of its lead: if anything, more is asked of the supporting characters. They must (and, thanks to nicely understated performances from Ciarn Hinds, Shaun Dooley and Roger Allam, do) project a discomfiting weirdness on proceedings. The unwilling hero, Arthur Kipps, must instead be a blank canvas. We are expected to project ourselves on to Kipps: that's how we become caught up in the suspense. Potter's admirably colourless performance is pitch-perfect in this regard - faint praise, I dare say - but if he is to lose the Radcliffe tag, this is the way to do it. In fairness to the young wizard, for large parts of the screenplay he is the only character on screen: there are only so many acting chops you can show off by creeping along an empty corridor.

There is, of course, one character trait Kipps must have that his audience lacks: a complete lack of judgment upon encountering eerie phenomena.

Say you're alone, marooned by tidal mudflats, in the grounds of a deserted Gothic mansion and armed with only a box of matches and a cocker spaniel. Dusk is falling, and from nowhere a vigorous clanking starts up in the upper part of the house. Popping outside to investigate, you catch a ghostly face at a top floor window out of the corner of your eye. You must not, as would a prudent audience member after the merest moment's consideration, make at once to the shore and start swimming for your life. You must instead take your box of matches and investigate, to the accompaniment of loud, discordant incidental music, even though you ought to know your matches will surely fail. The idiom requires it.

This makes for a superbly thrilling visual experience. No matter how transparent the director's intention, it is impossible not to be caught up. There were, at my preview screening, professional film critics watching through their fingers. If there had been sofas they would have been leapt behind. A boy of 14, who had been a bit cocky as the film opened, migrated to his father's knee and buried his face in the man's neck.

Kipps approaches a peephole and looks in. The entire theatre knows exactly what is coming next: a ghoulish face will flash close-up and an explosive scream will jolt the theatre. But when it comes you still jump out of your skin. This is fully exhilarating. The tension and release is orchestrated expertly by director: it is a very, very, good piece of film making.

The ending is unusual and, I thought, a little flat, but on reflection I thought it deftly handled, though exactly how I don't feel able to say.

So how to grade The Woman In Black, then? It is expertly edited, framed, lit and directed. It is fully cognisant of its own pedigree, of which it sees the funny side. It does feel short a vulnerable fruity maiden or two. But by comparison with Rebecca Hall and Dominic West's recent The Awakening]] - in concept a very similar film - it is vastly superior. It is no Citizen Kane, but nor is it trying to be. That is not a sensible standard to hold it against. And it represents a sure first step in the emancipation of Harold Potter.

Reason enough for a full slate.

Go see.
