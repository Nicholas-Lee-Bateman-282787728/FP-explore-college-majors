1903865,5,B0000A7W18,I purchased one for myself - my sister saw it and asked me to order one for her daughter for a Christmas present.,1292630400,,113,3.9565217391304346
1903866,5,B0000A7W18,"I really like this DVD.  I was disappointed with previous DVD aquariums I bought, so it was good to find this one.  The tanks are brightly colored, the fish are cute, and the picture quality is very good.  You can choose between regular aspect and widescreen, and 3 soundtracks (2 classical and one natural aquarium). The video switches from a static view to following different fish so it's not boring.  You can watch all the 5 tanks in order or set your favorite one to loop.  It's fun and relaxing to watch, and well worth the money.  I only wish it were longer!",1268524800,4,565,4.436893203883495
1903867,5,B0000A7W18,"I actually went to a party where this was playing and it was the coolest thing.  The picture was crystal clear and the fish were beautiful.  It was such a great idea to play while you are entertaining, it provides some awesome scenes & the music was turned down low so it worked with the party atmosphere as well.",1162339200,4,313,4.288135593220339
1903868,4,B0000A7W18,"This was an impulse purchase for me.  I have to admit it's not a bad pick.  You can put it on and set to repeat and you have 5 different fish tanks and it never gets boring. The tank is crystal clear. I actually sat thru the whole 65 min to watch it the first time thru with a friend.  It really was fun picking out fish and watching them do what fish do, talking about it. The DVD gives you a choice of 2 different music options and a natural tank sound. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that when the music plays it has a tendency to play the same piece over and over. We also caught a couple of repeat scenes in the total time in a couple of the tanks.  But all in all it's a really good DVD. After a rough day at work it will do the trick to relax you. Next to having your own tank this is a good substitute.",1124582400,12,830,3.7528735632183907
7996156,1,B0000A7W18,"I bought this hoping it would be nice to have in the background on the TV. Oh boy was I wrong.  Firstly I didn't like the way the video focused on an area then jumped to another, Not a soothing transition. If looking at an aquarium you may focus on one area but you then zoom out before finding another area to focus in on. Just butting one clip against another isn't great. My worst complaint however is with the music.  The only non-music track is the sound of a fast flowing stream. WTF? OK, if the producers can show me a marine aquarium (or any coral reef underwater habitat) that sounds like a flowing stream) I'll apologize. Until then... please go and listen to a marine aquarium or even better, go for a dive on a coral reef and hear what they really sound like (after all, aren't aquaria really imitating the natural environment?).  Having been turned off by the 'natural' sound track I thought I'd try the music. All choices were classical violin and all sounded very similar. Hmmm... In short, save your money. Go down to your local marine world equipped with a video camera and shoot an hour of footage. The video and sound will be much better than this garbage.",1457136000,,1175,4.455813953488372
7996157,5,B0000A7W18,I love Fish so the pictures was soothing.,1426204800,,41,4.25
7996158,5,B0000A7W18,"Soothing, realistic and beautifully set up. 100 out of 100.",1423612800,,59,5.0
7996159,5,B0000A7W18,"We love the many different fish tanks, and the music is also nice; sometimes we use it; sometimes we mute it and use our own. When we're having parties, our ugly TV becomes an attractive display.",1378252800,,195,4.444444444444445
7996160,5,B0000A7W18,I first saw this video at my acupuncturist's office and instantly fell in love with it. I checked with Amazon for availability and placed my order. It arrived in excellent condition and now I'm enjoying viewing it on both my main TV & my computer. I recommend it as a relaxing background with either nice music or aquarium sound effects.,1372118400,,337,4.633333333333334
7996161,4,B0000A7W18,"I thought it could have been more varied, also the music's depressing, should be more update.
Other than that quite pleased.",1362700800,,124,4.9523809523809526
7996162,5,B0000A7W18,"This is great! The scenes are beautiful, the cinematography is perfect. I've  got my aquarium without the clean up and fuss. I can totally have repeat so that makes it perfect for a romantic back drop setting.
Thank you",1361836800,,219,4.615384615384615
7996163,5,B0000A7W18,O would always recommend this Naked Fish and Have even before I purchased it. I have been watching this at our Doctors office for 2 yrs....... It is just beautiful and interesting to see what I am not brave enough to see personally in a ocean swim.,1357948800,,248,4.297872340425532
7996164,3,B0000A7W18,"the visuals  on this disc are beautiful.  I have, however, been unable  to change the music and the only music I can get is just too perky.  I would like the soothing sounds and It won't change for me.",1312070400,,201,4.076923076923077
7996165,4,B0000A7W18,"I was surprised when the picture zoomed in to follow some of the fish, I thought it was going to be just a video of a fish tank. After I got used to it, I liked the zooming and actually sat through and watched all the tanks play. The predator one is not as peaceful to watch because they tear up and eat a fiddler crab, but it is titled predator tank after all, so it's not like I wasn't warned.

The tanks are really too crowded to be real people's fish tanks, but it's a nice visual effect. In real life, if you had your tank that crowded, you'd have some floaters before long. And in the predator tank, they would have torn each other up. But that's why it's nice it's only a DVD. No dead $100 fish to have to worry about.

The music is nice, but gets boring pretty quickly. It's only about 5 minutes long then it loops. However, if I really want different music, I will just mute the TV and put on a CD. The tank sounds are nice, but after about 5 minutes of running water sound, I had to get up and go to the bathroom. We will be definitely be playing this DVD again. Just probably without the sound.",1300320000,,1105,4.041095890410959
