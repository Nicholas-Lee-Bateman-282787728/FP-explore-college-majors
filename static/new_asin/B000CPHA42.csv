8100088,4,B000CPHA42,"THE MISAKI CHRONICLES
The crew of the residential wing find themselves back at Earth, but are separated from it by a temporal barrier. When the pilots cross this barrier, the realize that Earth is actually in a different time continuum. The crew of the Watcher's Nest must collapse this barrier to stop the invasion, even if it costs them their ticket home, and their relationship with Misaki.

This DVD is the 2nd season of Divergence Eve. It is better than the 1st season, but still a little better than average. I like the way season 2 starts off. We get a better understanding of Misaki's feelings and we see some flashbacks about her past.  This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized., especially in season 1. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you. If you can rent it before buying it, I recommend doing that before you buy it.",1353801600,,1712,4.5732899022801305
