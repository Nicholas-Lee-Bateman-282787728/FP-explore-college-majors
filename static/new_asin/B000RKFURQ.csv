8201126,5,B000RKFURQ,"My children have been watching various Mighty Machines DVDs since they were around 18months old. My son LOVES trucks and we would often park nearby construction sites to watch the 'diggers'. Now that he is 4 yrs old, he is actually listening to the explanations of the trucks and how they work. When he sees a garbage truck, he explains how the truck takes the garbage to the landfill after it's been sorted at the recycling center. It's great to see him learning. Lots of entertainment and educational too.",1369353600,,507,4.707865168539326
