3719251,5,B001NJ915M,"I love old cemeteries, but this one in Prague, Czech Republic, is the most unusual one I've heard about. The availability of documentaries like this make having a Prime membership worthwhile for me, and it is definitely worth the cost to purchase if you don't have Prime. (Available on Amazon for purchase and elsewhere and on YouTube for rent as well--I must say that because I would hate for anyone with interest in the significance of old cemeteries to miss it. Lots of images of the cemetery online, as well.) This one-hour documentary is a delight, beautifully done. Sensitive, sad in places, as you'd expect from anything that touches on the tragedy of Jewish history, yes, but lightened up with sections that are almost fanciful in tone. It tells about the strange golem legend and the belief by some locals that the dead gather there at night to pray. Some current locals think it has magical properties. If you have any interest in the cultural or spiritual meaning of gravestone symbols and cemeteries, like to visit unusual places, or care about Jewish history and its fascinating symbolism and folklore, don't miss this one. Btw, it is in English, most of it, with subtitles. Not hard to follow at all. I'll watch again and again.",1412208000,3,1242,4.808411214953271

8327170,5,B001NJ915M,"I visited this cemetery many years ago, when it was free. It's really impressive and inspirational. The only I didn't like during my last visit, 4 years ago, is that now you have to buy a whole package, including things you may be not interested in. And it's not cheap. But it's understandable that it is a private and do not receive help from the government. One wonders why is that...",1463875200,,386,4.450704225352113

8327173,5,B001NJ915M,"I've been watching many Prime documentaries on the Holocaust this last week, and when I saw HOUSE OF LIFE offered as a Prime watch, I decided to view it, especially since it was focused on the Prague Jewish cemetery. I was keen to find out if this cemetery was affected by the events of the Holocaust. To my pleasant surprise, I learned more than I expected.

The Prague Jewish cemetery has tombstones dating back to the 1400s, and was used primarily by the residents of the old Jewish ghetto back in the 15th and 16th centuries (in 1787, all burials within the city were banned for sanitary reasons). I learned that one of the most prominent tombstones in the cemetery is that of the Maharal of Prague, the Rabbi Judah Loew, who was a renowned rabbi and learned personage, admired by many, including Gentiles. The tombstones also reflect designs of various historical periods, including the Renaissance and Baroque periods.

It is heartening to know that despite the tragic events of the Holocaust that saw the decimation of a large percentage of European Jews (miraculously, the Nazis did not destroy this cemetery), there are still people, both Jews and Gentiles alike, who are dedicating efforts to preserve the culture and history of the Jews of Prague. There are restoration efforts underway to restore some of the much older tombstones so that the inscriptions can be read in entirety. As one person says on the documentary, these tombstones are an ""incredible source of forgotten poetry.""

I am not Jewish, but as a person who loves history and learning about the traditions of other cultures, I enjoyed this production very much and will probably watch it again. There's a sense of serenity about this old Jewish cemetery, with its lopsided tombstones among the more erect and majestic ones, almost enticing one to uncover the mysteries  and histories of the long-deceased occupants.",1457568000,,1892,4.940251572327044
8327174,5,B001NJ915M,"This film concerns the Jewish cemetery in Prague. It is explained by showing the history of the Jewish population who lived in Prague,centuries ago. Very moving. And of great interest to me because my ancestors lived in Bohemia,and some lived in Prague. The cemetery is on my bucket list.
The film is very well done,and provides a lot of history to those interested in the subject.",1456531200,,381,4.787878787878788

8327178,5,B001NJ915M,We visited this site last year on our trip to Prague.  The film covers the history of the Jewish quarter there.  Very interesting.,1439510400,,130,4.608695652173913
8327179,5,B001NJ915M,"A VERY solemn and informative video of the Jewish cemetery in Prague, CZ. Even when this history goes far back to the 1500's, the Holocaust is also included and how the Jewish people managed to experice life during this great tragedy to their people. Restoration and solumn feelings still exist today even when Tourism insists on viewing these stones in a very historic atmosphere. Excellent video on the history and interviews with people who did manage to survive and as they try to improve their lives because of it. If you really are history buffs, this film is helpful in adding this to your repetoire. Death certainly is part of life.",1434585600,,640,4.774774774774775
