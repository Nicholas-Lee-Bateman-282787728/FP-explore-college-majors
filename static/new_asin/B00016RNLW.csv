8321946,4,B00016RNLW,"I've started buying BMI videos since I bought an issue of Sport Compact Car that came with a disc featuring a few great segments from different Best Motoring DVDs including a togue battle, a comparison of some of the virtually extinct inline-six powered cars, and a battle between Evolutions and Imprezas. So far the only BMI DVDs I own are Drift Bible and Type-R Legend (though I'm hooked and there's more on the way), and Drift Bible aside, Type-R Legend isn't quite as much fun to watch as those segments found on the SCC magazine DVD. Legend is quieter and paced more slowly and it has annoying and emotionless voice dubbing with no option for subtitles. However it is still a great DVD, especially for a Honda fan. There's a lot of ""battle"" (race) footage and bits of great technical information like how they balanced the Integra R. They even show the B18C5 engine's head having its ports ground at the factory (an exciting 5 seconds of footage to big Honda fans) and there is some interesting information on NA tuning given by the president of Spoon Sports throughout the video. My only major gripe with the video is that they don't give a lot of attention to the Spoon Integra (they just tease you with a lap around Suzuka). Overall it's a high quality video that belongs in your BMI collection. Plus, the bonus footage of the Honda SSM (became the S2000) taking a full lap on the Nurburgring Nordschleife is just great.",1173052800,,1428,4.625984251968504
8321947,4,B00016RNLW,"This is the only racing-related DVD I've ever purchased that wasn't cheesy.  I really enjoyed this but I primarily got it to check out the Integra Type-R.  But after one viewing, I had a new love...the Civic Type-R...and the S2000...and the NSX.

Seeing these cars in action is amazing.  Almost every car has a time-trial or race where you sit in the cockpit and can watch through the windshield with the pedals shown in a side frame, and the tach in another side frame.  The driver spouts out some comments as he drives (and they're translated into English).  Kinda lame but the driving is flawless and seeing how these profressionals talk about the Type-R line is really cool.

The final chapter on this disc is some guy driving an S2000 prototype on a really cool, twisty, country road.  Simply awesome.  He gets all the way up to 200+ k/h and it's a great ride.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this.  It seems a bit dated (when was this recorded?) but it's the only video that I've seen that has covered these vehicles in this much detail.

One of the races has a Celica GTS, WRX, and other great sportscars.  There are 2 Integras in that race and one of them gets clipped by an out-of-control WRX (or Lancer Evolution) and has to drop out.  The other Integra smokes them all!

In another race they have 2 different Integras (95 & 98) with the Civic.  Not quite fair so the Civic takes the lead and then holds off the Integras by taking the twisty section of the course.  Again, simply brilliant driving.",1091059200,3,1508,4.5055350553505535
