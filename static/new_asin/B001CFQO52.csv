3512230,5,B001CFQO52,"The darkest, deepest, most disturbing volume in the Hellsing Ultimate series. Easily the best! You'll laugh, you'll cry, and maybe cringe a little bit too...",1223164800,,157,5.32
3512231,4,B001CFQO52,"The fourth chapter of the anime at the very top of my current ""drooling in anticipation of every release"" title is finally here and it delivers.  After some truly obnoxious and distracting humor took the black sails out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/last-volume/dp/B000TI85VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">last volume</a>, I'm happy to say that that this one is relatively goof-free, though not perfect.  If you've ever thought that the characters of Hellsing are not the strong point, you are about to be schooled.  While there is no shortage of gore and murderously exciting (though brief) action scenes, this chapter chooses to expand the story,raise the tension, and introduce a cavalcade of new warriors into the ring.  The villains get their due this time around.  In fact, the last ten minutes is nearly entirely devoted to a spectacularly mad speech given by the Millennium organization's leader, The Major; a man Alucard put down half a century ago during WWII.  Millennium's goal is chaos.  Bringing the world to it's knees starting with Britain by realizing the Third Reich's plan of a vampire army.  ""Hellsing Ultimate: Volume 4"" gives us the declaration of war, and it's opening skirmish with Great Britain's defenders from the supernatural, the Hellsing organization.

The film opens with Alucard phoning Integra.  Not to say hi, mind you, but to continue his taunting of his master about the human bloodbath she ordered in Volume 3.  But it turns out that there is one human that the No Life King respects: the Queen herself, who he meets not for the first time at a roundtable conference including the Vatican's hated Iscariot organization.  Yes, Father Anderson is in this installment as well.  Never a bad thing.  The meeting is interrupted by a messenger from Millennium.  Now if there is one thing I have never, ever thought it is ""Hellsing needs more catgirls"".  Sure this particular catgirl is a boy, but seeing that the character model is essentially Seres Victoria with cat ears, I'm calling it what it is.  Alucard's reaction to said catgirl: blowing it's fu#*ing head off.  Have I mentioned that that vampire is my favorite animated character of all time by about a mile?  The Major describes him best: ""immortal, invincible, undefeated , and almighty"".  He forgot ""wicked cool and pure evil"", but he is plotting to kill the guy so you expect him to omit a few praises.  In Volume 4, the head vamp adds kamikaze pilot and possessor of God-like evil power to his resume.  That's a good day for most any creature of the night.

My favorite thing about Volume 4 is the character on the cover.  A nazi vampire girl who calls herself Rip Van Winkle, possessing a joyous personality and a love of singing triumphant old-time war songs.  Her weapon of choice is an old-school single-shot musket.  Why use a single-shot weapon?  One is all she needs to destroy an army.  She can guide the bullet's flight to take out as many targets as she wishes or hit the same target repeatedly, shredding even fighter jets to bits.  But there is one thing she can't do; and that thing is keep her composure in the presence of the baddest vamp on the planet.  Pity.  I really loved that character and wished for better from her.  But hey, we can plainly see that The Major has an entire freak show of brilliant-looking characters at his back so I expect future volumes to be insanely action-packed.  Also of note is an Integra/Seres scene that seems to have come from a fanboy doujinshi. Not complaining, just observing.

As cool as this is, the pacing at the end is quite atrocious for such a short film.  While this is the longest Hellsing OVA yet at around 55 minutes, when the last 15 or so consist of only a villain's speech and a slow supernatural torture scene that borders on rape than you imagine much more could have been done.  This is pretty much a symptom of the main complaint which is pretty much the same complaint I would level at every volume of ""Hellsing Ultimate"".  IT'S TOO DAMN SHORT!  The wait for these is torture for me and the short length of each story keeps me perpetually frustrated that each DVD ends right when it's reaching critical mass.  It keeps me lusting for more of my favorite ongoing anime, but it annoys me as well.

Well that's the skinny on ""Hellsing Ultimate: Volume 4"".  It fails to reach the heights of the amazing Volume 2, but it isn't far off either.  As far as the animated vampire-kills-nazis action/horror genre goes it won't get much better than this.  If you haven't seen any of the Ultimate series than you have done yourself a disservice.  These OVA's mostly kick the snot out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/television-series/dp/B000FVQYQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">television series</a>.  If you don't wish to experience the same story as the original anime, start with Volume 3 where the action deviates from the established anime story and enjoy what is a far superior continuation of the first half of the television show's story, which got a little stale after the halfway point.  Here's to a quick release for Volume 5!

4 1/2 stars, rounded down for an underperforming cover character. (sniff)",1222819200,8,5255,4.980482204362802

8287507,5,B001CFQO52,"Excellent well made and scary as hell and I love it, I have both Hellsing, and Hellsing Ultimate this is way darker and bloody then Hellsing is, Walter has a secret of his own and it is a real mind blower, Integra deals with betrayal, trechery and being abandoned by certain indididuals whom you'd never expect it from. If you love Hellsing you will definately love this one. My only regret is i can't get the the last one wish the company would put it on the market, Sigh",1416355200,,472,4.314606741573034
8287508,5,B001CFQO52,This a wonderful DVD. It just happens that the person I bought it from was selling the Limited Edition Two Disc case which was awesome. I was expecting just the one dvd case so I was happily surprised by that. The series is a must see.,1375920000,,235,4.130434782608695
8287509,1,B001CFQO52,"The animation in this OVA is great, but that's about it.  The music has none of the soul or feel from the original anime.  There's a bad over reliance on sheer blood, gore and guts.  Long winded story.  Glad I watched a mate's copy of this and didn't waste my money on the series.  Can't say I'll be buying it. The original is far superior in every aspect (other than the aforementioned animation itself).  Yes, I know the OVA runs more true to the original manga, but crikey, they've *ruined* this.  Volume 4 hardly has an Alucard in it at all!

Avoid at all costs.

8287514,5,B001CFQO52,"The Good Things
*Excellent video/sound quality.
*This version of ""Hellsing"" has excellent imagery and graphics.  It includes a lot of computer-generated-imagery, but none of it looks too hoaky or out-of-place.  It is definately high quality animation.
*Excellent amount of bloody action.  Some of the scenes in this volume are downright awesome.  Also includes a few comical moments.
*Storyline is great.  It is close to the original manga.  It has also accelerated in momentum, thrusting the whole Millennium Group story arc into the saga in a way that is very revealing and cohesive.
*Characters are splendid.  All of the main characters are still great.  The characters of the Millennium group are now introduced, and are a very interesting group to watch.  The main enemy in this one (Rip Van Wrinkle) is fun to watch (although she doesn't put up much of a fight against Alucard).
*Some good lines throughout.
*Funky music (although I think the music in the old ""Hellsing"" show was better).

The Bad Things
*Not for the sqeamish; contains lots of bloody violence and swearing (rated TV-MA).
*A lot of stuff is packed into a single hour.  As fast and condensed as everything is, it may be seen as overly compressed with not enough exposition.

The Other Things
*If you buy the single-disc version, you get little or no special features.  The two-disc steelbook edition (although more expensive) includes a small wealth of interviews, textless credit scenes, a karaoke version of the major's speech (which was pretty darn long), and probably some other stuff.

This volume is probably one of the best in the series so far.  The action scenes are incredible, and the whole episode is fun to watch (except maybe the end, with the major's super-long monologue).  Above all, they finally introduce a cast of interesting characters that had never been seen before (except in the manga), and they are great to watch.  It is clear now that ""Hellsing Ultimate"" is not just another serious vampire shooting spree; it's a whole lot of fun.  A definate must-buy for those already into the series.",1224547200,3,2087,4.982658959537572
