8520223,5,B007P8PXZW,"This DVD box set came in perfect condition and right in the window of delivery stated. No rip-off anime here, this is the real deal - in Japanese (no subtitles, so beware!) and does NOT play on American DVD players. Does come with a small poster and some fun character stick-it note type items. You either need to rip it for your region, or they play with our Windows Media Player on the computer. The only thing I would change (though it's out of the sellers hands) is the ability to track your package. My kids waited everyday for the mail to see if ""today would be the day!"" It would have been helpful to see see where the package was as it's progress towards us. Would buy from this seller again without hesitation.",1359158400,2,719,4.373134328358209
