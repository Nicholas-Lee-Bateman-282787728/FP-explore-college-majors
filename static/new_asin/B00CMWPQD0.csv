8583633,1,B00CMWPQD0,If there were a place for 0 stars i would give it a ZERO. The picture quality was so bad you couldn't see what was going on. Do not rent this movie.,1473292800,,148,3.65625

8583635,2,B00CMWPQD0,"It's not this I have a problem with. I could not watch because the projector I purchased through Amazon, even though it was advertised as a 3D capable projector, it is not.",1462752000,,172,4.40625
8583636,1,B00CMWPQD0,This joke of a movie was listed as 5 stars and winner of some award on the Amazon streaming utility on my TV.  Must be somebody's idea of a joke.  Reminded me of the moronic creature features of the late 50's.  Video was just blurry.  Couldn't even tell it was 3D.,1389312000,,264,4.117647058823529
8583637,1,B00CMWPQD0,"I would give this a quarter star if I could. The only redeeming piece of this movie is that they ""attempted"" to do it in 3D. After discovering it was side by side 3D (now I know what SBS means), I set our Sony 3D TV to say it was side by side. That put it in whole picture but the 3D is horrible, even if we had left it side by side. It was like watching a blurry movie. The acting and special effects were beyond terrible with something I could have done on my home computer. It even had 2 sex scenes with female nudity. Definitely do not let your kids watch this. I just wish I could have gotten my rental fee back.",1388188800,,617,3.9047619047619047
8583638,5,B00CMWPQD0,"The updated VFX are great.  Looks awesome on my 3D Samsung 65"" TV with 3D glasses.  The storyline is similar to the X-Files TV show (aliens, abductions, pregnancies, and all-around bizarreness) and is based on real police reports.  Mulder and Scully would approve!  If you liked Avatar or Spiderman 3 you will love Children of the X-Files in glorious 3D!",1369180800,2,354,4.85
