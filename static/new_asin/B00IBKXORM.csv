8640712,1,B00IBKXORM,"MGM's assembly-line coldness desecrates the talents of Buster Keaton in his poorly conceived ""talkie"" debut.  ""Free and Easy"" (1930) is historically fascinating in its awfulness. Trapped in a hopeless situation, Buster manages a few bright moments amid the overwhelming studio gloss. Unfortunately, the opportunities for Keatonesque physical humor are squandered. Though his talkies were a mixed bag, Keaton's remaining MGM vehicles did not plummet to the depths of ""Free and Easy""  not to mention its Spanish-language counterpart.
