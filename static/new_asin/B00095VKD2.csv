8307791,4,B00095VKD2,"We remember an age by its comedians. The 60's and 70's gave us Billy Connolly, Monty Python, Woody Allen and Peter Cook - to name a small few. The 80's and 90's gave us Ben Elton and French and Saunders. Today we are being amused and entertained by great comedians such as Ricky Gervais (the Office) Sascha Baron Cohen (Ali G) Simon Roptell (Garter and Quail) and Larry David (Curb your Enthusiasm) to name a very brief few!

But when we turn back the clock fifty years, we see comedians that are figureheads of their time but still so close to the sensibilities of ours.

Classic TV Comedians feature Groucho Marx - one of the greatest comedians of all time. A man of today wedged into the past. Groucho is laughing at the era and getting away with it. We also see Uncle Miltie, Bob Hope and Abbott and Costello in skits that made them famous and skits that have sadly been forgotten.

A lot of the skits may have dated, but those that haven't are well worth the purchase price!",1144368000,4,979,4.397790055248619
