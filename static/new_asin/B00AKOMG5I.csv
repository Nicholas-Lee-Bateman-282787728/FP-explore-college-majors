8553173,1,B00AKOMG5I,"I saw this once on TV and enjoyed it, and was looking forward to viewing it again.  But it would not play on my Blu-ray player.",1399939200,,127,3.8846153846153846
8553174,3,B00AKOMG5I,"I fell in love with Stephanie Leonidas (Pinaruti) while watching SyFy's ""Defiance.""  I had seen her in nothing else, so imagine my joy to see her here without all the nose/forehead/hair appliances required for her role as the alien Irisa.  May this lovely, talented young lady know a thousand rewarding roles.

The Discovery Channel cannibalized several scenes of this movie to make an hour-long TV ""documentary"" of the Santorini-as-Atlantis theory, narrated by Terry O'Quinn.  A search on Amazon turned up the original movie (ASIN: B00AKOMG5I,) in Blu-ray no less!  The seller, DaaVeeDee, delivered promptly, and I quickly spun the disk into my firmware-current PlayStation 3.

Darkness.  Silence.

I tried it in my firmware-current 3D Panasonic player upstairs, where I got menus and sound, but no video.

On the disc's Amazon page, the ""Product Details"" show ""Region: Region B/2, Region A/1.""  Region A includes the Americas and Eastern Asia.

The first sentence of the ""Editorial Reviews"" states ""Netherlands released, Blu-Ray/Region A/B/C . . .""

One may be forgiven, in my opinion, for assuming this is a region-free disc.  DaaVeeDee's response to my complaint asked me to ""please accept our apologies.""  They also offered this advice:

""Unfortunately, some US Blu-Ray players, such as Sony and Panasonic don't play 'all zone' imported Blu-Rays. If possible please try playing the Blu-ray on another Blu-ray player.  If that doesn't  work, please contact Amazon Customer Service, since your order was fulfilled ans hipped (sic) by Amazon.""  (Insert sound of hand-washing)

Forgive me, DaaVeeDee -- ""try playing the Blu-ray on another Blu-ray player""???!!!???  Am I to assault Best-Buy with a moving van, buy one of each player, try them all and simply return the ones that won't play this disc?  One could always buy a region-free player, I suppose, but buying a disc and then buying a player to fit it seems the wrong way around.

The listed region coding for this disc is inaccurate and deceptive, so heed this warning.

If you know how, a visit to a BitTorrent site will reward you with a 1080p download of this movie that can then be burned onto a dual-layer Verbatim disc to make a beautiful, PLAYABLE DVD in HD.  If you keep this purchase you'll have a nice case to store it, and you can feel that you paid royalties to the work's owners for the privilege.",1377216000,4,2368,5.012820512820513
