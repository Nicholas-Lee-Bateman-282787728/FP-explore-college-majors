8544780,5,B001PL3VFY,"Or, My Treasure, is an extraordinary example of modern Film Noir.  A tragedy  worthy of Euripides.  Ronit Elkabetz plays a truly pathetic and believable in the role of the aging prostitute, Ruthie.  However, Dana Ivgy is award winning in the haunting title role, Or, and will stay with you for a long time.  This is a true tour de force for director, Keren Yedaya.  It should not only be seen, but owned and re-seen periodically.",1445644800,,429,4.653333333333333
