The stage settings were quite vivid but complimented, not distracted from, the action. An orchestral interlude between acts was longer than expected but very well done. I originally bought this just to investigate the Weber/Wagner continuity issue but will be watching it often just for the enjoyment of the piece.",1452470400,,483,5.113924050632911
8072156,4,B000A1INPS,"I was completely unfamiliar with this opera, only knowing his Der Vampyr opera.  This work is a typical German romantic opera featuring  spirits and gnomes and other worldly things, melodic music, and heightened melodrama. It is typical of it's type, and, of course, owes a major reference to Webers Der Freischutz. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable work in its own right, and it was well performed here.

Hans Heiling is the king of the gnomes, underworld dwarfs, who has fallen in love with the mortal woman Anna. They are to be married in a few days. She does not know of his background, but, at the urging of her mother, is planning to marry Hans because he has great wealth. Hans mother strongly opposes this wedding as it will remove him from the underworld and cause him to lose his powers. Anna agrees to the wedding, but when she learns of the true background of Hans, she is frightened and appalled, and flees to her former boyfriend Konrad for protection and help. Hans vows vengeance and is torn apart by his lost love, but, in the end, at the urging of his mother, he leaves Anna to her new husband and returns to the underworld.

This highly romanticized story includes magical elements involving the gnomes, Hans mother, and a magical book of spells, and emotional elements involving Anna and Hans himself.  Along the way there is delightful tuneful music including much with a folk element to it as when the villages are celebrating the wedding of Anna and Konrad.

I thought the staging and all the major performances were well done. A special salute goes to Anna Caterina Antonacci, who is one of my absolute favorite Sopranos. Her performance here is exceptional, and she has never looked more beautiful. Bravo!

One surprise element in the score is that the chorus of gnomes is actually a Childrens chorus!!  It was an unexpected surprise to hear these young voices (which, by the way, open the opera).

The DVD itself is fine. The audio and video a very good to excellent, the subtitles only have a few errors, and it is a typical, well-made, Dynamic DVD. I salute them, an Italian company, for putting on a typical German opera, but they pulled it off with flair and quite a lot of fun. The included booklet was informative, and a welcome addition since there are no dvd extras.

I recommend this for those not familiar with Heinrich Marshner's opera.  I think you'll find it quite enjoyable.",1391212800,4,2412,4.691943127962086
8072157,2,B000A1INPS,"This mind-numbingly dull and wholly uninspired opera tells us again just how revolutionary Wagner was.  The production is quite mediocre; the lead singer especially needs some vocal coaching.  The costumes are dull. Above all, the music lacks any sort of spark.  It just goes on and on and on.",1201046400,3,293,4.938775510204081
8072158,5,B000A1INPS,"If you ever wondered what opera was like before Wagner and wanted to move a little away from Weber check out Marshner. He would probably be more popular today if Wagner hadn't completely overshadowed most of what preceded him in German opera. Hans Heiling is as romantic as it gets. He is the king of the elves and falls in love with a mortal. Marshner portrays the mortals using Singspiel and he uses a more romantic thru composed style for the other world. The singers are all up to their roles. And the production does not betray the romantic spirit. It is simply gorgeous - and how often can you say that about a modern European opera production? One quibble - the subtitles are too small and therefore difficult to read. The other problem is that it is difficult to believe the heroine would prefer the stocky stodgy tenor to the dashing Hans. What's wrong with her? Oh, right, this is opera. If you've ever wondered what lies beyond Weber check out this delightful DVD.",1123200000,27,975,4.577142857142857
