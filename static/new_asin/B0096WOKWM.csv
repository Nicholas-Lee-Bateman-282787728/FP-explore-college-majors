5275130,5,B0096WOKWM,Tara Stiles is amazing and these are just honestly amazing DVDs. Anyone interested in yoga at all would love these. Would give 10 stars if possible.,1348012800,,148,4.730769230769231
5275131,5,B0096WOKWM,"First: I am not a yoga expert by any means! I am just someone who really needs to get moving, and after seeing some of the reviews for Tara's new series (and because it's so cheap) I figured I would give it a try.  I was sort of nervous because it sometimes they are lying when they claim workouts are for beginners.  But this dvd is incredible because Tara's moves are simple enough for a beginner like me to understand, yet they are challenging enough to get me really sweating. I won't lie, it is pretty hard to stay on pace, and I am not anywhere near as flexible as Tara, but all that really matters is that I am moving and seeing results!",1348012800,10,644,4.185483870967742
5275132,5,B0096WOKWM,"I have to admit I'm a girl who loves her yoga dvds ;) when I saw that the entire program was only $20 I couldn't resist! I just got them in a few days ago, but I can already tell that I will wear them out because Tara Stiles is soooo AWESOME! She is not like other yoga instructors b/c her pace is so much faster and she doesn't break flow.
I absolutely recommend the dvds to anyone who likes yoga and wants to have fun when working out!",1348012800,8,437,3.9213483146067416
5275133,5,B0096WOKWM,"Never done a review before but I wanted to show Tara my support! The dvds are great, beautiful unique locations and many different routines.  They are worth it for beginners as well as people who have been doing yoga for a while.  I love Tara's short youtube routines so I was super excited about the dvd's and I wasn't disappointed!",1347840000,4,333,4.533333333333333
5275134,5,B0096WOKWM,"I've been a Tara fan for a few years now, so I was super excited to see the This is Yoga series come out.  I would say that I am pretty good at Yoga, so I wasn't expecting much of a learning curve. First, I love the modern vibe! The music is stuff I would put on my ipod and as always Tara's voice is calm but not too pushy. The sets are modern and don't have the typical Hawaiian vacation vibe most yoga dvds have.  I was also really psyched that Tara has SO many different types of routines, she even does Yoga in a bed! Even though I'm not necessarily a beginner, I still found the Beginners Yoga For Everyone DVD because it got my body used to her flow and moves.  The best part is how many different options the dvds have. It would take years to memorize all of her different workouts, so I'm not worried about getting bored with this set.",1347580800,33,844,4.072289156626506
5275135,5,B0096WOKWM,"I used to be a Yoga junkie in my early 20s but I haven't been actively practicing.  I wanted to workout at home before I went to a studio so, I picked up the This is Yoga series. Tara makes it super easy to follow her moves, even though I was totally out of Yoga shape.  I hate when yoga videos move too slowly and only use basic poses, and Tara manages to avoid doing this.

For beginners who are pondering getting the dvds:  I would say go for it. The set has a beginners' video which will get you on the right track.  And not to mention, a POSE LIBRARY!!!

For people like me who already know the basics:  Absolutely go for it. You are going to be challenged and you will get in a great yoga workout. There is nothing dumbed down, so it won't be too easy or too boring.",1347494400,8,772,4.006535947712418
5275136,5,B0096WOKWM,"You definitely get your bang for your buck with these DVDs. So many Yoga DVDs are all about talking and not doing poses. Tara provides explanation but she is never not moving, and she uses her body as the example rather than her just blabbing the whole time. Tara is also amazing at helping you breath correctly, but again she doesn't stop what she is doing just to show you.  It's hard to explain, but like other people are saying, Tara is just soo different than other yoga instructors. She is modern like a celebrity trainer, but she is down to earth and welcoming (not snotty at all).",1347494400,6,588,4.444444444444445
5275137,5,B0096WOKWM,"The settings in this DVD series are SOOO refreshing compared to normal Yoga dvds.  The sets are simplistic and completely unpretentious bc they strip it down to just yoga and the natural surroundings.  Each workout is sleek and very 2012. (My favorite is the sunset workout with the LA skyline in the background) Also, Tara has the best voice, she just seems so much more up to date than the typical yoga dvd people.  She has great flow and the way she speaks is if you are being personally trained by her instead of you doing an instructional dvd. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone (even beginners) who are looking to get away from the bland traditional yoga dvds and want something modern and up-to-date.",1347494400,30,723,4.677165354330708
5275138,5,B0096WOKWM,"I am VERYYYY BUSY and always looking for a workout that fits into my schedule. A friend at work recommended Tara, so I ordered this series (FOR $20!!!!!! That's unheard of...). Having no experience with Yoga I was pretty nervous, but once I tried the Beginners Yoga For Everyone DVD  I was pleasantly surprised.  Let me say first, any beginner will not look as elegant as Tara does, but she is great at telling you how to make the moves easier. She is constantly talking about what she is doing so you are never lost, and her descriptions of what she is doing makes really easy to follow.

I definitely recommend the dvd to any mom who doesn't have the money or time for a gym and who wants to get in shape.",1347494400,30,707,4.3007518796992485
5275169,5,B0096WOKWM,According to my girlfriend this is the best Yoga DVD,1443225600,,52,4.3
5275170,5,B0096WOKWM,"It's inspiring to just watch and learn from Tara. She moves so effortlessly. As a yoga instructor, sometimes you don't want to think, or plan a sequence... You just want to connect, listen and move... Tara does this for me every time!",1436400000,,234,4.595238095238095
5275171,5,B0096WOKWM,"Great for all level as there is a DVD for everyone at any level of yoga.

Excellent instructions, fun, love the flow of the routines, and great setting.

Varying length of routines so will fit into any schedule or time constraint!

Definitely would recommend. My favorite yoga DVDs to date and can't beat the price for 4 DVDs!",1430611200,,326,4.586206896551724

5275178,3,B0096WOKWM,"I very much enjoy the DVDs and Tara Stiles' style of yoga. However, the first DVD arrived scratched, so it does not play continuously which is disappointing.",1425600000,,157,4.851851851851852
5275199,4,B0096WOKWM,"A great set. The only reason why I didn't give it all 5 is because she goes very quickly, leaving you scrambling to catch up at some points. Otherwise, wonderful.",1424908800,,162,4.433333333333334
5275200,5,B0096WOKWM,"My favorite work out dvd ever!!
I was not into Yoga before but Tera stiles made me like it. I started her free verson of stretching AM yoga on YouTube. I really liked it and bought her dvd sets on Amazon. It has varied different levels and duration times. Background is nice. Music and her ton of voice are really calming.",1424044800,,322,4.295081967213115
5275201,5,B0096WOKWM,"I absolutely love these DVD's. I love all of the Yoga routines! However, on the back it shows you how long each routine is and someties it's wrong. For instance the ""5min"" routine that you're supposed to do before bed, it's 30 minutes not 5 minutes. I honestly didn't care because it was such an amazing routine.",1423440000,,312,4.491228070175438
5275202,5,B0096WOKWM,"Who but Tara Stiles would put out 4 dvds for the price of one. Love this girl and her ease. I got so tired of competing with myself and getting burned out mentally in workouts. Why have we bought into the myth that we cannot enjoy what is good for us? Great set, great teacher great perception.",1423353600,,294,4.175438596491228
5275203,5,B0096WOKWM,Daughter-in-law loved it.,1423094400,,25,7.666666666666667
5275204,1,B0096WOKWM,"I read lot of positive reviews for this video and I even read some people mentioned that this is not for beginners. I tend to ignore that while ordering because i see more than 200 positive reviews.
But after watching the video i completely need to agree that the author's audio is tooooo fast and not even close for beginners to use it. The video might be good for somebody who is already into Yoga for long time.

So definitely going back to the seller !!

If anybody recommends any other yoga videos for beginners please share it.",1421020800,3,533,4.428571428571429

5275207,5,B0096WOKWM,"Thanks Tara. Now I am a Yoga Evangelist. I love the exercises.

If you are a yoga beginner it might not be the right DVD collection to get started, but for advanced yogis it is fabolous.",1420675200,,186,4.166666666666667
5275208,5,B0096WOKWM,certainly not for a beginner unless you are a contortionist,1420156800,,59,5.0
5275219,3,B0096WOKWM,I was really hoping to make this my go to yoga program but I found it no so beginner friendly.  I'm familiar with a very small number of yoga poses so I thought I would jump right in to this one unfortunately she speaks way too fast for me. I find myself watching the tv more to understand exactly what pose she is describing instead of actually doing the poses.  I found it difficult to follow but I'm going to give it another try.  Hopefully I'll catch on soon.,1419206400,,463,4.179775280898877
5275220,5,B0096WOKWM,I love this set. Tara is amazing. By far my fav yoga videos to date.,1417737600,,68,3.6
5275221,5,B0096WOKWM,"This is the best dvd set out there for starting/continuing to explore your yoga practice.  I have finally found something that I can do on my own schedule, is complete, comprehensive, can practice in the privacy of my own home, stay committed to my practice without any hype, and so very affordable.  Tara Stiles is without question the best yoga instructor out there who cares about how yoga is practiced in the western world.",1416960000,,427,4.756756756756757
5275222,5,B0096WOKWM,"I love Tara's method and her flows are easy to follow.  If you are a beginner-intermediate student looking to build strength and flexibility, then this series is perfect for you.  Tara gives modifications to assist beginners and reminds you that it's not a competition!  I've been alternating her videos 5 days a week for 5 weeks straight now and I'm not bored in the slightest!  I rarely even have to look at the screen...It's so nice to listen to her instructions and follow her smooth flows without straining my neck to look up every few minutes.  I have been able to practice different poses through her pose library that is super helpful as well.
My only complaint (which doesn't even bother me really) is that some 30 minutes sessions are listed as 15 mins on the back of the DVD covers.  No problem though.  Surprise!  You're getting a longer workout :)",1416960000,,860,4.6490066225165565
5275223,5,B0096WOKWM,"I enjoy this DVD series, its good for anyone to try because it's not that difficult. It also helped me build my own routines.",1415923200,,125,4.25
5275224,5,B0096WOKWM,Absolutely love Tara Stiles.  The DVD Set is great and gives you many different exercise options to choose from ranging from 5 minutes to 60 minutes.  The videos are very easy to follow along.,1414368000,,192,4.617647058823529
5275225,5,B0096WOKWM,I always liked watching Tara's Ford Model vids way back when. So far these are great too but sometimes I feel she speaks a bit fast. Still exploring them and happy with my purchase.,1413763200,,181,4.352941176470588

My daughter and I tried one (I don't remember what the title was but it was an evening setting) and I found the instructor to be clear and knowledgeable. I think they are well done.",1411516800,,296,4.016949152542373

5275240,3,B0096WOKWM,I'm a newbie to yoga and thought this would be perfect but she moves really fast and it kinda discouraged me. But I will maybe go to a class or try another type of dvd. I need something that goes slow and easy,1410825600,,209,3.883720930232558
5275241,5,B0096WOKWM,This set is a great value and Tara Stiles offers well paced yoga classes.  There is a lot of variety in this set to keep your practices fresh.,1410566400,,142,4.071428571428571
5275242,3,B0096WOKWM,Tara Stiles speaks so quickly that it's difficult to follow her high speed speech and movements for a beginner.,1408924800,,111,4.894736842105263
5275243,5,B0096WOKWM,"I've been following Tara on social media platforms for years. Unfortunately, I don't live near NY so I'm unable to benefit from her guidance in person. However, Tara makes her knowledge and advice completely accessible.
As a massage therapist and yogi, I've really enjoyed being able to tailor my at-home practice. I've even been known to lend my DVDs to clients so they can experience Tara's yoga style. I've only ever gotten positive feedback - even from first time yogis! Everyone from a young male teen athlete to an older woman getting back into exercise for strength and flexibility have found these practices accessible and easy-to-follow.
I highly recommend this set of DVDs. You won't find a better price for a more incredible product or instructor.
Thanks Tara!!

5275245,1,B0096WOKWM,"I am so very disappointed in this teacher.  The beginner DVD she is talking sooo fast...it certainly is not meant for giving time for a beginner to ease into the stretches, or for that matter even understand what she is meaning or showing you.  I have done yoga in classes many times, and have never heard anyone talk so fast! Don't get this set unless you have been practicing yoga for some time.",1408320000,3,397,4.424657534246576
5275246,4,B0096WOKWM,"Lots of great yoga here...I do understand why some do not like Stiles as an instructor. She does talk a bit fast, and some of the poses are not for beginners, but she does tell you, often, to do only what you can, and she does offer modifications.  There are some sessions on here that I will never use (5 minute yoga in bed?  Not for me...) and some of the times noted on the backs of the DVDs are just not correct.  Otherwise, it is some great yoga.",1407283200,,451,4.044943820224719
5275247,5,B0096WOKWM,Tara Stiles rocks!  I watch a lot of her videos on the internet too.  You feel good when you get done without pushing yourself beyond what you can do.  Some of these are advanced but she assures you to do what you can and you get better as time goes on.  Her voice is soothing too.  Fast shipping thank you.  Very pleased with this purchase!,1406851200,,341,4.1692307692307695

5275249,4,B0096WOKWM,"I love Tara Stiles, and so far the sessions I've tried have been great. My only complaints are that, as others have pointed out, the times on the back don't match with how long the sessions actually are, and that my DVDs came in cardboard sleeves, not the plastic cases shown in the product image. Not a huge deal, but that's why it's only getting four stars instead of five.",1405641600,,375,4.371428571428571

I have no idea on the content of these DVDs but right off the bat I'm irritated. The DVDs come in cheap cardboard sleaves NOT the regular type of cases that you normally get with DVDs like the ones pictured. Like I said I am not commenting on the content. I'm just disliking the deception because what is pictured is not exactly what you get.,1403827200,,444,4.174418604651163

She has a calm and normal voice and isn't too earthy, peppy or breathy, which really annoys me. I only wish she would explain some of the moves a little more during the routines (like appropriate angles for downward dog, lunges, etc.). I am beginner/intermediate and I always find myself repositioning myself to get the correct angles.

5275298,5,B0096WOKWM,This DVD set is great for beginners like myself. The pose library is great just to watch through before starting an actual class.,1393027200,,129,4.6521739130434785
5275299,5,B0096WOKWM,Great lessons from beginners to really advanced. My wife loves this gift and does the lessons almost every day. Thanks.,1392854400,,119,5.0
5275300,5,B0096WOKWM,I'm a yoga teacher and I love these videos. They're creative and fun! They are a bit fast paced and there aren't many alignment tips so maybe this is not the best if you've never done yoga before or aren't familiar with basic poses like down dog. Other than that they're great!!,1392768000,,278,4.365384615384615
5275301,2,B0096WOKWM,"She goes way to fast for beginner. I wasn't able to relax or enjoy the work out. I felt frustrated at the end of it. I had to pause so many times, in order for me to get the pose and to breath more than once at each pose.",1391731200,,221,3.5306122448979593
5275302,5,B0096WOKWM,I will say that only one DVD is actually suited for beginners as she pretty much assumes you already know the moves. My only gripe is that she goes through the poses fairly quickly but after watching multiples times you pretty much adjust.,1391472000,,239,4.5813953488372094
5275303,1,B0096WOKWM,"I had high hopes for these DVDs based on the positive reviews alone. I started the Power Yoga tape and turned it off after 5 minutes. She talks too fast and is mostly unintelligible. I can't imagine why anyone would enjoy doing these tapes. It's very strange to have a person speaking so fast when relaxation is a major part of yoga. Before these tapes, I would have said Colleen Staidman Yee was the worst DVD instructor. She's easily been usurped by Tara Stiles. This is just bad yoga. If it helps anyone, Rodney Yee is my favorite DVD instructor. All of his tapes are amazing and even though he has his own style, Yoga Shanti, he gets the job done. I'm actually returning these DVDs. They're that bad.",1391299200,12,704,4.465116279069767

5275306,2,B0096WOKWM,"I'm new to yoga and I'm not very graceful.  I need a yoga video where the instructor talks super slow and allows my clumsy self to get to the pose and feel it out and stay there for a few seconds before moving on to the next pose.  This is NOT that video.  She talks soooooo fast and you're on to the next pose before you know it.  I even slowed the speed of my DVR player down!!  Now, again, I'M A NEWBIE.  I need to be able to look up at the TV and see if I look even remotely like the teacher.  This is NOT that video.  If you've done yoga before and are looking for a home practice, I imagine this is a great DVD set.  But if you aren't that flexible and you are not familiar with the poses and you have a hard time understanding people who talk fast, this is not the video for you.",1390089600,,786,3.8322981366459627
5275307,4,B0096WOKWM,I enjoy the fluidity of the exercises. I guess we are to assume proper positioning throughout as Tara does not give a whole lot of alignment cues throughout which is normal as she dives from one position to another in seconds.  It was helpful to have the pose library on disk 4.,1390089600,,278,4.346153846153846

5275325,4,B0096WOKWM,"I as a first-time yoga participant found Tara to be a very qualified instructor. She was very easy to follow and her program flowed nicely. I couldn't give it 3 stars for it would suggest mediocrity. I couldn't give it 5 stars because I am honestly not qualified to judge in order of perfection, buy rather the highest mark I, in my experience can legitimately give.
  I injured my back (as severe as you can get without a ruptured disc) and after being mechanically and structurally corrected by my local professional Dr. Michael E. Whitman FACACN I knew I needed some real strength and conditioning to maintain myself. I had always been fit, strong, and hark-working. (Too much of anything is too much) and I got impatient and blew it. Tara's yoga has strengthened me, increased my flexibility, and helped me get my youthful male stamina back for as the old saying goes "" what do you do when you take a hit?""  Get busy preparing and growing again! I have already recommended this to friends and family for I am well pleased. My wife has noticed increased firmness in my whole body. It has also increased my sexual stamina (which my wife thinks was already high) and brought back some much needed hope; for in the prime of my life (31) I found myself unable to, and lacked the confidence to, perform my extensive daily tasks.
  As someone who was fit, strong, flexible, and by all means a vigorous young male, I found that I have much respect for yoga. It is challenging to say the least!
  I wish Tara blessings in her whole-hearted pursuit in this career. She is a talented, passionate, and very beautiful young woman and deserves the best life has to offer. Thank you Tara for producing such a fine and useful product!
May God bless you as you pursue life and give man-kind something worthwhile.
 If I may...  If you can find time in your already very busy schedule... my wife and I have a ""bun in the oven"" 2 mo. along (our 3rd!) and she is having a hard time. She was a very active woman.. she runs our farm.. Wheelbarrows, stalls, hay, water buckets, and worked out. she's 5'7"" and 117 and strong. Since the pregnancy she has gained more than a desirable weight and has become discouraged for the natural gastric issues associated with pregnancy forbade her from normal activity. I assure her she is beautiful for she is, but this one is hard on her. Do you offer anything that can help her now that she is able to do a little more which can increase her strength, self esteem, flexibility, and prepare her for delivery? I would appreciate anything from your very professional opinion. Or if you have a program you sell... I would be interested.

5275326,3,B0096WOKWM,"Nice CD's.  Moves (so far, not all the way thru the set) are do-able for a non trained yoga person. My frustrations/ complaints are that
she talks so fast, making it hard to understand her. And transfers into different poses are so quick I often can't keep up.  Keeping
my eye on the TV screen to watch - instead of just listening, which is challenging- makes it hard to stay in pose most times.
I don't have time to just watch it a few times and memorize what will be next. If you are not very patient, these CD's will drive
you nuts.",1388016000,,535,4.184466019417476

I've simply written down my own table of contents as I go through the materials. That quibble aside the actual teaching itself is excellent.,1387152000,,279,4.6

From power yoga to restorative yoga, from a fifteen minute stretch in the morning, to an hour of challenging core work, this collection has it all. The power yoga in particular is very creative and interesting. A must have for any practitioner who enjoys yoga DVD's.

The practice flows and the poses aren't held for an eternity which keeps the good, calm energy circulating. No staleness to this yoga chic. The scenery is varied and its a welcome change from some of the other yoga sets. It's refreshing to watch and she's a pleasure to learn from. She's very skilled in her verbal descriptions and keeps you on your toes. This isn't a sleepy yoga practice. It's awesome and invigorating.

Great product and would buy again especially for the price.  I bought a yoga cd in a target before this for the same price and that one was so outdated (despite its modern cover) and required so much excess materials that I was definitely not feeling it.

This on the other hand was great!

I tried many different yoga dvds, but then discovered Tara Stiles. Wow, I love, love, love her yoga workouts! Her 4 dvd set really is complete yoga. You decide what you are in the mood for, then just pick the workout. Her instruction is awesome- now I just listen to her voice as I follow along. It is like having a friend as your instructor. She doesn't push you through, but leads. In each pose, she goes from easy to advanced and you just do what you can do. I am amazed at my progression! My joint pain has lessened, flexibility and strength increased, and I am able to do the advanced poses most of the time. And a sure fire way to get a handle on stress!

5275389,4,B0096WOKWM,"These DVDs were exactly what I was looking for in a yoga DVD, but there were a few issue.

The negatives: The DVDs come in paper slips. That part was totally cool by me, but it was the information written on these slips that were the problem. The flows that were listed on the slips didn't correspond with how long the flow actually was. A 15min flow may end up being 30min, while a 5min flow could be only 3min. Also, the word ""beginner"" is used pretty liberally. If you are someone who has less than 15hrs of experience with yoga, then this isn't for you. There isn't enough time between poses to learn them appropriately,  If you have between 15hrs-25hrs of experience, then this may suit you if you are patient and mindful with it.

The positives: I consider myself an intermediate yogi and I love this DVD set! Tara does a good job creating flows that move well together and are engaging. They are also very thorough. I stopped practicing for a week due to an injury, so I was afraid that I'd be too tight to enjoy the 30min gentle flow. I was happily wrong and the flow made me feel great. It got to every muscle. The DVD allows for a balance of challenge and calmness. Also, the DVDs have a very wide selection of flows. The music, film, and instruction is great too!

Long story short, I would definitely recommend this as long as you have a good basis for basic poses and breathing.",1379289600,,1391,4.359073359073359
5275390,3,B0096WOKWM,"I found out the hard way that what is on the DVD case isn't really what is on the DVD.  The most significant is DVD2 which states Calming Night Time Flow for 5 min. but is actually a full 47 min. practice which happens to be filmed at night.  Several others are off by quite a bit as well.  I also found that there is a lot of cross over using the same poses in many of the DVD tracks, when doing multiple tracks in one session I was experiencing that they were all exremely similar.",1379203200,,483,4.010416666666667

5275393,4,B0096WOKWM,"I loved this DVD set, but I really want to point some things out. The yoga series are great, Tara Stiles performance is graceful and balanced, and the sceneries change from the usual landscapes (sometimes beautifully boring) to the city at night, for example. I found this pretty original; I think the point is to show a yoga practice for the real life. Of course, you can practice by the beach before sunset in Bahamas if you are able to, but your everyday real- practice is going to be less fancy, and Tara makes this somehow special. Beginners may find the poses and series very challenging and a bit fast. I would like to recommend them to watch the DVDs entirely, before picking up a flow and take it at their own pace, with respect for their bodies, being patient and trying to avoid frustration. For some reviewers, Tara talks way too much and fast. This may be annoying at first, but when you try to follow her, the instructions and encouraging that she gives are both clear and helpful. Please try her YouTube channel first, if you have doubts. I also recommend watching the DVDs in your computer first, because some of the series were not correctly timed. This is a weakness, because you cant choose a flow of 15 minutes if you are short of time for the practice without checking it out, or you can be late for work and stressed for the rest of the day. Lastly, I think the 4th DVD (library pose) is the most helpful for beginners, because it offers a variety of modifications, which can lead them into the full pose in the future. I would have LOVED this DVD (and Id rated this set with 5 stars no matter what), if it had some kind of interactive menu of matrix, because you cant pick up a pose without watching the rest of the DVD chapter. With this pros and cons, I rated this set with 4 stars, feeling a little short, because Taras work worth 5.",1378857600,2,1859,4.391304347826087

I really enjoying doing her yoga DVDs, I really feel relaxed! The beginner DVD and the AM/PM yoga DVDs go at a slow pace for a beginner can follow it but there is still a flow to the yoga which is so important to me. I am not a fan of yoga DVDs where you do one pose, hold it for a long time, and then do another pose which has nothing to do with the previous pose.",1378080000,,539,3.8214285714285716

I appreciate this, because it makes yoga accessible to everyone. There are a ton of routines included in this DVD set. I see a lot of people commenting on the low price. I have to say, you get what you pay for. I purchased the $20 set. They arrived in cardboard cases and will not play on my computer..

5275414,4,B0096WOKWM,"I love that Tara made this video series, however I wasn't able to use the whole product because one of my dvds was ""unreadable"". DVD 1, the strong and relax workouts couldn't be read by my computer, dvd player, or xbox. I just ended up with a dud, which is alright. The other three, however were great, especially the pose library. I like that she includes poses and tips to work up to things like inversions, etc. Great instruction and I felt myself feeling motivated and calm at the same time, wanting to push myself further to go to the next workout or just finish the one that I was on. Intense training, but beneficial all the same. Shipping was fast and everything was in great shape. I was a little turned off by the cardboard packaging of the dvd's. I would have preferred actual cases. I only give 4 stars because of the unreadable dvd and storage cases. Other than that, content is great and would give 5 stars for that.",1375056000,3,930,4.412790697674419

5275416,4,B0096WOKWM,"I got curios by watching tara's episodes on youtube. These dvds are a must for her fans. If you like her style, this collection is awesome. The backgrounds and music are beautiful and calming the mind. With a little practice it is easy to follow. Perfect for everybody who is searching for some routines longer than 10 minutes.",1374537600,,327,4.655172413793103
5275417,3,B0096WOKWM,"I'll start with the good. I really enjoyed the variety of workouts provided on the 4 DVDs. The workouts are well paced and a great balance between challenging and restorative. I like Tara's instruction as she reminds me a great deal of the teachers at the studio where I normally practice, which makes this a great addition to my normal routine. At $20 I think this is a good deal on the number of routines provided.

With that said, I was disappointed when I first received these DVDs. I have ordered from Watch It Now Entertainment a few times and this is the first time I have received a product that was not 100% as advertised. The picture on the listing shows four DVD cases. The DVDs actually arrive in cardboard sleeves. I could look past this as the packaging is actually less cumbersome than a plastic case, however I did have an issue with these not playing in my DVD player. They only work on my laptop and I have been less inclined to use them as frequently as other workout DVDs I own because connecting my PC to my TV to get in my morning workout is an extra step I don't always feel like taking early in the morning.",1374364800,3,1131,4.334905660377358

Unbelievable price.  Highly practical and instructive.

Tara is explaining all the poses so precise that encourages watcher to get up and start doing yoga. Tara is so comfortable and friendly that she emanates the spirituality in all her majestic poses.

Thank you very much Tara, wish you Nirvana .",1374364800,,391,5.158730158730159
5275429,3,B0096WOKWM,I really love Tara's workout and saw it on YouTube and ordered it after my first try. My only problem with this order is that the advertised photo shows that the item I ordered comes with DVD cases and the product I received came in small cardboard sleeves. It does not mention this anywhere in the description. I just feel that the images should represent the product I will be receiving in whole. That is a disappointment and a little deceiving. The value of the product definitely changes in my eyes based on how I can store it.,1373932800,,531,4.428571428571429
5275430,5,B0096WOKWM,"Tara offers so much variety in these DVD's. I bought these months ago and I'm STILL enjoying them, which is rare for me when I do workout videos at home. Buy this set-your body, mind, and soul will thank you!",1373673600,,208,4.225
5275431,3,B0096WOKWM,"The price for the set was good, however I'm not too keen on Tara Stiles.  I've never seen any of her DVDs so this is my first, and probably last.  She talks in a rushed voice and almost condescending to the point where it is irritating.  It's almost as if she is just doing the DVD just to get through it with not much passion for Yoga.  Other than that, the cinematography is beautiful.",1373241600,,387,4.1891891891891895
5275432,4,B0096WOKWM,"In beginning a yoga practice at home using DVDs there are two things I am looking for and this DVD set has them both.

First, liking the instructor is going to be key.  I purchased these DVDs after viewing some of Tara's YouTube videos and I am really happy with her as an instructor.  She has a calm voice, reminds you to breathe, and encourages you to only do the movements according to your ability. While it can be intimidating for a beginner with limited flexibility to watch someone so accomplished, I felt that the constant reminders to do what I am able to do were reassuring and I was able to relax into my current ability level. Sometimes the transitions in poses are faster than I am able to do at my level, but I find that is true of most of the DVDs I have looked at. For your reference I am a former martial artist recovering from an injury that resulted in a 40 lb weight gain. I have lost a tremendous amount of flexibility and fitness and am making the slow journey back.

Second, a variety of options for daily practice and a reference for the poses.  These DVDs have a variety of flows and I am slowly working my way through them to determine which ones I will be able to modify easily for my ability level using props. I have previewed them all and am happy with the movements (and the modern sets). I am also working my way through the catalog of poses and am really happy to have that as a reference.

Now for the more critical part - and why I can't give it 5 stars. The one thing that would make this DVD set better is a short introduction for beginners that explains how to use props. If I did not already know what props were and how to use them, I might have been more intimidated by the flows thinking I had to do them unassisted. Also, I second the reviewer's comments about the differences in flow descriptions from what's written on the case to what it's called when you play the DVD. I do find that slightly annoying and will be working on my own cheat sheet.",1373068800,,1991,4.240105540897098
5275433,5,B0096WOKWM,"I love these DVDs !

I have been doing yoga since I was a child and have had so many excellent examples of ""instructors"" both in real life and some whom I have enjoyed on DVD. Tara Stiles is not one of them. If you can get past Tara's way of leading you through the poses you will enjoy how you feel after....I guess that is what it's about.",1370995200,2,468,4.269662921348314

Although I have been practicing yoga on and off for a few years, I was never motivated to really get into it before I found Tara's online videos. I am now not only a huge fan of Tara's style and delivery of yoga, I also find myself excited about getting up in the morning to do her yoga routines. Thanks for making yoga accessible for everyone!",1370649600,,516,4.385416666666667
5275452,5,B0096WOKWM,"I still consider myself to be a begginer at yoga and this dvd does move a tad fast but the pace would be perfectly fine for someone that knows somewhat what your doing. I don't know what any of the ""poses"" are called other than a few but Im learning more and getting better with each session so do not be put off by all the reviews saying she goes too fast, any begginer will be a little slower until you learn the poses and don't have to keep looking at the screen.

I love her dvds because they are way more fun and up beat than a lot of others I've seen, if your still not sure check out a few of her youtube videos.",1370563200,,619,3.9126984126984126
5275453,4,B0096WOKWM,"I discovered Tara Stiles on You Tube, and quickly became a fan. Her DVD collection is wonderful because it offers a wide array of sessions that range from energetic to relaxing. I also appreciate that the different sessions vary in time, so if I only have 20 or even just 5 minutes, there's a session for that, as well as for hour-long flows.

As for the instruction, I will first say that I like the fact that she gets right to it without lengthy introductions in each video. I just want to turn it on and get right to moving without having to sit through or have to fast forward through lengthy commentary.

I will note that she goes a little fast, as she usually does if you watch her other videos on You Tube.  This was one of the first things I noticed. Therefore, if you are a brand new beginner, expect to feel like you're left a bit behind. In such cases, I would recommend that you either watch some of the videos first to get a feel for her style and tempo, or just be a good sport about getting the hang of it.

The good thing about doing Tara Stiles' yoga is that before you go and purchase any of her DVD's, you can easily look her up on You Tube and watch some of her videos so that you can get a good idea about her style and what she offers.

I only took off 1 start because it would have also been great to get a brief session on breathing techniques or meditation to follow up some of the yoga sessions with.

All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase and have been able to start my home yoga practice instead of spending big bucks at yoga studios.",1370476800,,1569,4.127868852459017

I can only accomplish the two Yoga in Bed routines which are more like a five minute stretching routine than yoga.  I ordered Your Daily Yoga from Yoga Journal on the same day and although the film sets are boring (completely white) and the instructors aren't as bendable as Tara, they do seem to be for actual beginners.

I love the variety in these dvds, and the workouts are anything but slow and boring.  I look forward to doing these everyday and I choose a different workout everyday or combine the shorter ones so I am doing at least 60 minutes a day.  Tara is a wonderful teacher who talks you through each and every pose.  It is so helpful when first starting as I would get my left and rights mixed up.  I cannot believe how many poses I can do so much better in such a short time, although I am striving for more.  My goal is to do a head stand with ease.  Not only have these dvds transformed my body, they have inspired me to look into yoga and meditation more.  I have stopped doing any other exercises, yoga just makes so much more sense, I am using all my muscles in every workout instead of just targeting a certain area.  I highly recommend these to a beginner who is looking to get fit and who wants to be inspired to relax and find inner peace.",1367280000,,1116,4.144186046511628

The different lengths of videos are helpful to do yoga every single day even during a busy schedule. It's very easy to chose the difficulty and desired state of mind you'll feel afterwards with the descriptions.

The calming evening flows are amazing for receiving a good night's sleep. I have found the hour long energizing flows extremely useful to have a calm mind during a hectic day.",1367107200,,595,5.061224489795919

When it comes to those 4 DVDs I went through 3 of them so far and the practice is great. Tara makes sure you are breathing first instead of pushing you far beyond your options. And no matter how advanced or beginner you are, you will always find the right exercise on one of your disk!

The only issue someone might have is that Tara speaks a little bit too fast, but I would think that the flow of exercises needs it in order to follow your breath. And as you become more advance, you will be able to catch up ;o)

You're better off looking on youtube for some good yoga instruction or better yet, enrolling into a class. If you're intermediate to advance, you would have no problem working with this dvd, but if you want clear instruction and general explanation of what you are doing, it's not happening here.

They have everything from a quick 5 min AM / PM routine to a 25 - 50 minutes routines.  The only thing I wish she would do is slow down a little, there will be times that she will say stay here and breath as long as you want and then she'd quickly move on...you have barely enough time to grab the remote and pause and by then you have moved and might as well move on.

She studied ballet in her youth and it shows.  She is so graceful.  Thanks Tara for your beautiful Diva style of yoga!

I'm very pleased that they are working for her!

UPDATE!: It's now been over three months since I wrote this review.  I can now add that my 28 year old son is using them, too!!  He was using those ""extreme"" videos, but he kept hurting himself.  He was a Marine and has degenerative problems due to running with heavy gear (not to mention being blown up in Fallujah).  After months of nagging him to try these tapes, my son broke down and now he loves him.  I hear him often say, ""I need to do my yoga.""

She does a great job of moving through the poses at a decent pace.  She does talk a little fast, but I have gotten used to it and am getting better each time.  The only other thing I would say is, as a guy, it's a little challenging at first to stay focused as she is very attractive, but again - getting past that and into the work itself, and it's very rewarding.  I would recommend this to anyone who is tight on time, and wanting to do yoga without having to go to a class.  Thanks Tara.",1364688000,,646,3.856060606060606

My only complaint is that there is inconsistency in the titles. The names of the routines on back of the DVD and what pops up when the DVD plays don't match.
Its not hard to figure out, but its a small flaw.
Other than that, its a brilliant collection!

I'm a super beginner so I don't touch the discs with inversions and 45 minute workouts, but they are there for me when I can move up on difficulty. Great instructor. She tells you everything she's doing out loud so you don't have to look at the TV constantly and strain your neck. The second or third time I could follow along audibly instead of watching her every move, but she's there for reference. You hate her at first for being so flexible and I've even yelled at her for thinking I could move my body like that, but I have and it's working. You really feel sore the next day from all the work you're putting in. Buy these!! It's not some cheesy workout video.",1364169600,2,758,4.345070422535211

twenty minute yoga workouts.  The two workouts that really make this dvd a winner is strong flow and energy flow.  Both flows are
an hour long and I suspect it might be like taking one of her Strala classes. I was sweating doing the one hour yoga sequence

She obviously knows YOGA and effortlessly demonstrates every move.  If you don't understand a move, just stop for a minute and watch (that's what the rewind button is for).  After doing the routine a few times, you'll get the hang of it and will need to stop and look less and less.  I especially love the AM and PM Yoga flows.  I often come home from work and just need to unwind.  Her PM Yoga routine helps me do just that.  There are two or three different Yoga flows on each DVD (each lasting around 45 minutes) so you have plenty of variety to choose from.  She demonstrates serious Yoga with a relaxed attitude that encourages you not to take yourself too seriously.  Great for all Yoga levels.  I highly recommend these DVD's.",1361059200,,887,4.50314465408805

As an instructor, I find Tara Stiles cold, detached and not spiritual by any means.  She does not give clear descriptions of the asanas and the pace she sets is too fast. It felt like a gym aerobic class.  Yes, twenty dollars for four CD's sounds like a good deal, but it wasn't.  A waste of money.",1360540800,18,421,4.109756097560975

5275512,5,B0096WOKWM,"I became a yoga lover a few years ago when I started college. I was really searching for a way to help ease the stress and anxiety I was feeling from school on a  daily basis. I didn't actually fall in love with yoga until I went to a class in Venice Beach taught by a intensely spiritual instructor. When she left and I couldn't take classes from her anymore, I found solace in other nice instructors at my local gym. I still loved yoga, but it wasn't the same. When I came across these 4 DVDs for just $20, I thought I would try them out. Best $20 I've ever spent! Seriously. I love the variety of yoga 'workouts' she has from 15 minute relaxing sessions to 60 min of core work. She moves between poses quickly enough that you don't get distracted, being in your house and all, but not too fast that you can't keep up or feel relaxed. When my mom, who has never done yoga before, saw how much I loved the DVDs, she decided to try them. She loves them, too! She is now hooked! So, don't feel like you have to have experience in yoga to try these. Order and enjoy! :)",1360454400,3,1067,4.105263157894737

The covers say the routines are about 20 to 30 minutes and the routines that I actually did were about an hour 15. Also if youve never done yoga before it is a little hard to keep up even with the beginner dvd she doesn't explain poses or names and she moves through them quickly.

Each DVD has multiple sessions that relieve the boredom and they really challenge you.
However, I would not recommend these for beginners.
These are ""flow"" and she moves quickly through these series and I think you need to be familiar with the poses to adequately

5275533,4,B0096WOKWM,"I have been wanting to be interested in yoga for many years. I had a single DVD in my collection & quite frankly hated it. After periodically trying it & continuing to hate it over the years I finally had a ""DUH"" moment & decided to try a different instructor. 3 instructors later I happened upon Tara Stiles. I liked what I read about her (online) and since this set was so affordable I decided to take the leap.

I like her instructing ability (although at times she talks so fast I wonder how a beginner can keep up). Her voice is soothing & unpretentious. Her ability & awareness of her own body are incredible & instead of feeling like giving up (when I see what she can do), I feel like challenging myself to go further.

The production of the videos are *slightly* annoying however. The ones in outdoor settings are (generally) nice and a great change of pace from the traditional studio shooting. I just finished one routine however that was shot in a hotel room (with Tara on the balcony & the camera in the room). So they were shooting through a sliding glass door which was just distracting & the door supports cutting through her head & body the whole time frankly annoyed me since I still have to watch her to get poses right. More annoyance with camera shots from below (so I'm looking up at her) since I can't see her foot placement.

And as another reviewer mentioned, the routine titles on the box don't match what's on the screen. Sometimes they're close, but most times I've just had to guess & hope I've gotten it right. This will cease to be an issue once I've done the routines enough to remember what's what.

So for all my annoyances, this is still a great set (and a great buy). I will probably have 5-star love for them once I've progressed enough to not need to watch the tv & do the whole routine by verbal cue only.",1356220800,3,1844,4.36734693877551
5275534,2,B0096WOKWM,"I  was really excited to have new yoga material, as my routine had gotten stale- and the reviews sounded really promising.  Unfortunately, she speaks WAY too fast, a little too much, and just zips through the poses. The narration is off- she's telling you to take your time, relax into it, breathe a lot-  while on screen she's already moved into the next pose- so she has to quickly catch up in her narration. I am in no way a traditionalist so I don't take issue with the approach- I just find it irritating and don't get how it's supposed to be for beginners.  It's just too speedy a form of yoga for my taste (and that's saying something because my regular kundalini is by no means slow)- and now I unfortunately have 4 of these discs.",1355443200,19,739,4.372262773722627
5275535,4,B0096WOKWM,"For the price this is a great mixture of yoga flows.  I like that I have the option to pick either a shorter or longer sequence depending on how much time and energy I have. I would say this may not be the best if you have never taken a yoga class before, as she moves pretty quickly between poses and I find myself rushing at times.  The camera angles constantly move on some of the flows, which can be frustrating when you are trying to remember which side you have and haven't worked yet.",1355270400,,491,4.157894736842105

5275540,5,B0096WOKWM,"Love this. Tara is one of my favorite instructors for her tireless effort to remind you to breathe. These disks are soothing, beautiful, relaxing, and fun. There is definitely a flow for everyone in these disks. Great variety for beginners up past intermediate and even on to advanced who still like a guided practice that is a nice self-challenging no-brainer.

Tara's narrative is like a constant path guiding you through every moment with your body in each pose, suggesting play and even micromovements within the greater poses of the flow. I love it! Flow yoga constantly moves, so it can be hard to get clear guidance in new practices unless you choreograph it yourself.

Can't say enough good things about this set. Really. It's exactly what I've been looking for in a DVD set for years. Hours of good feelings for body and mind! Varieties of length practices from a 5 minute routines in bed for am and pm, 15 minute Gentle Flow on Disk 2 to an hour long flows on Disks 1 & 3, and plenty of 30-40 minute flows too.

Thanks Tara and Strala Yoga for being inspiring, warm, friendly, and approachable. Your love of yoga shines through everything you do, and is contagious. Thank you for being the breadcrumbs we need from where we are in our yoga practice to where we know we want to end up.

People seem confused about routine time lengths. Disk two's descriptions have a few names for each flow, so I can see where the confusion is from. The descriptions and times are listed on the back of each disk, but here's a quick guide:

Disk 1
  - Strong Flow (1 hour play time) listed at 60 minutes
  - Relax Flow (34 minute play time) listed at 30 minutes

Disk 2
  - AM Flow (33 minute play time) listed as Beginners Flow
  on back of case at 30 minutes
  - Gentle Flow (14 minute play time) listed on back of case
  as Relaxed Easygoing Flow on back of disk at 15 minutes
  - PM Flow (48 minute play time) listed on back of case
  as Calming Night Time Flow at 50 minutes

Disk 3
  - AM Yoga In Bed (4 minute play time) listed at 5 minutes
  - Daily Flow (32 minute play time) listed on back of case
  as Daily Basic Flow at 15 minutes
  - Energy Flow (1 hour 2 minute play time) listed on case
  as Energizing Strong Flow 60 minutes
  - PM Yoga in Bed (6 minute play time) listed on case as
  Bed Time Flow at 5 minutes

Disk 4
  - Pose Library
  Sets of poses related to topics such as Seated, Standing,
  Sun Salutations, Arm Balance, Inversions, Back Bends,
  Reclining and runs 90 minutes total according to
  back of case
  - BONUS: Strength and Flexibility poses listed as 20
  collective minutes on back of case

Hope that helps! :) I'm printing it up and putting it with the disks for quick reference for myself too since I don't have them memorized yet.",1353542400,92,2764,4.338582677165355
5275541,3,B0096WOKWM,"I think Tara is very cool and inspiring. I was very excited to get this set. However, my main complaint is, it was difficult to figure out which workout listed on the DVD goes with which description and time on the back. The majority of workouts did not match the times given on the cover and it would have been nice to see the (correct) times on the menu when playing the DVD. Like another reviewer said, a 15 minute routine was really 30 or more, etc. Also, the title or description on the DVD did not match what it was called on the back of the cover (where the times are listed). I exercise before I go to work and time it accordingly. I had to break it off in the middle on several routines because of this inaccuracy. At first I thought I just got confused, but realized something was off. Also, the way the library DVD is done I didn't care for. She shows a lot of poses, but on one side only. So, if you follow along you would have to do the other side on your own or replay the DVD. Or, if you want to do both sides for a pose you would have to pause the DVD after each pose. The 20 minute routine on this DVD is also longer than even 30 minutes which is when I stopped. Although a bargain, I felt this set could have been organized better. The instruction is Tara's typical style, she will talk continuously and fast which I don't mind but it might not be everyone's taste.",1352160000,43,1383,4.107011070110701
5275542,5,B0096WOKWM,"This is the best purchase I've made for myself in a long time, and certainly the best yoga purchase EVER. Easy to follow, relatable, and has enuogh different sequences to keep it interesting. I feel like I'm taking a Strala Yoga class. And it was a steal at $20. I can't say enough good things about this DVD set.",1351468800,3,313,4.322033898305085
5275543,5,B0096WOKWM,"I was so excited for Tara Stiles new DVD set - however, I live in Australia and the DVDs are not yet available here.  So, my impatience got the better of me and I got a friend to order them through her family in America. It was beyond worth it, going through that extra trouble to get my hands on these incredible workouts! I'll admit I was skeptical about the weight loss benefits of yoga, but I'd tried some of Tara's podcast videos and after a week was already seeing results. The DVDs are even better (if that's possible).  I've been doing the 30 minute Beginners AM Flow and love how you can build up to doing some of the more difficult poses.  The Pose Library is incredibly helpful - Tara constantly provides tips for beginners as well as clear instructions to make sure you're accomplishing the poses correctly.  I've yet to work up to the more difficult routines, but would completely recommend this to anyone.

I've never done a yoga class before, so this was the perfect set to get me motivated.  I think it's really good to combine with other exercises - I've tried mixing the yoga with Zumba DVDs and even just going for afternoon walks.  I've found that yoga seems to boost the benefits of other exercises (for me, going for two one-hour walks a week and doing 20-30 minutes of yoga every day has given me muscle tone, weight loss, and even reduced cellulite - not to mention I'm more relaxed than I ever knew possible!).  But I'm not exactly a fitness fanatic, so in my experience you don't have to do a separate workout and yoga routine to see results.  I'm pretty confident that yoga can stand alone, as long as you keep up with it.  Although it is early days, at the moment I cannot go a day without doing at least one of Tara's 5-minute podcast workouts.

So why should you try ""This is Yoga""? 1. It's $20 for 4 dvds - an amazing bargain! 2. It boosts flexibility and helps with poor posture. 3. Tara keeps a decent pace and doesn't confuse you with strange phrases (e.g. ""breathe through your left lung"" - she just guides your breathing and technique, which is great! 4. It helps with weight loss (well, mine anyway) to make you feel more confident. 5. There are plenty of routines and poses to keep you interested in continuing on with yoga (I love how the more difficult poses provide goals to work up to - like those insanely amazing headstand poses, really!).  So Thank You Tara! For once exercise is not a dreaded practice, but an absolute delight and necessity!",1351382400,7,2487,4.4657836644591615
5275544,5,B0096WOKWM,"I totally dig Tara Stiles' philosophy on yoga and these 4 DVDs are great. She leads you thorough great flows and gives suggestions for different levels of strength and flexibility without making you feel like a loser for not being able to achieve the most challenging positions and encouraging you to love the level you're at.
Having 4 different routines is nice to keep the variety going and she's a great teacher.
I'd definitely recommend this, especially for the price - great value!",1350950400,,486,4.867469879518072
5275545,5,B0096WOKWM,"I've been doing yoga for about a year and the instructors I've taken classes with were a mixed bag. I decided to get DVD courses for my convenience and I went with Tara Stiles because I've seen many of her videos on YouTube. What's great about her routines is that she gives a lot of options and variations, and most importantly, she explains things thoroughly. Too many instructors are good at what they do, but don't explain in detail how to get into the poses very well. Tara's routines are a bit fast, but she's talking the whole time, so you're not in the dark if you can't see the screen (which is often the case in many poses).

""This Is Yoga"" is a good series because it has yoga for different purposes and takes place in different settings (including in bed). You might find the routines are very similar, but there is a good eye for balance and symmetry, and the pose library is very valuable. If you want yoga for ""real"" people, and not a religion, this is for you.",1350604800,3,976,4.362637362637362
5275546,4,B0096WOKWM,"I thought these videos were overall very good.  I was at a point in my practice where I needed more of a challenge.  She does a good job of explaining pose variations which helped me get more from yoga.  The only thing that I didn't really get and was a little annoyed by was her tendency to say ""breathe a lot"".  What does that mean?  It was a little confusing to me but I just did my best to keep an even breathing pattern. Otherwise I have no complaints.  It was very helpful to me and I would recommend these videos to anyone at any skill level.",1350604800,2,549,4.08411214953271
5275547,4,B0096WOKWM,"I love Tara, and I love all these DVDs; however, on DVD 3 (AM/PM YOGA FOR EVERYONE), the DAILY BASIC FLOW says it is 15 minutes, and it's actually 30 minutes.  This is a major disappointment, and I will have to deduct a star, as I was really looking forward to having a daily 15-minute routine.  Other than that, the routines are awesome, and you really do get your $$$ worth!",1350432000,2,376,4.28169014084507
5275548,5,B0096WOKWM,"Fantastic, challenging fun.  This is a great set at a great price.  Love it.  If you enjoyed the New york sescions DVD then you will realy like this one.",1350432000,,153,4.206896551724138
5275549,5,B0096WOKWM,Please try it! This is an amazing Yoga compilation and class. You have everything you need to become a full time yoga practitioners starting from 0 or even if you have yoga experience. I highly recommended there's nothing like it,1350432000,,229,4.75
5275550,5,B0096WOKWM,"This really is a complete yoga library. The 4 dvds have a variety of workouts whether you are looking for something quick and relaxing, a bedtime practice or a intense hour workout. It has beginner to more advanced workouts which is nice because you can grow with this dvd set. Tara Stiles is a great instructor!",1350345600,,312,4.589285714285714
5275551,5,B0096WOKWM,"I think these 4 DVDs cover absolutely EVERYTHING. I bought the set because Tara herself recommended me I should start with this, and even directed me to some of her videos on youtube while I waited for my set to arrive! And the first time I did the Beginners Yoga for Everyone DVD, I felt absolutely great!! Light, calm, and, believe it or not, a wee bit more flexible. I've been doing both the routines on the Beginners Yoga for Everyone DVD and the Daily Basic Flow on the AM/PM DVD, and I think those are the best ones you can do to begin with (whether you have or haven't done yoga before).

There's a routine on the Daily Yoga for Everyone DVD called Strong Balanced Flow, I thought it was a lot more challenging than the ones mentioned before! So was the one called Energizing Strong Flow on the AM/PM DVD. So, my advice: make sure you master the first ones first... and THEN move on to these last ones, because they ARE advanced. And, as Tara explains, make sure to take it easy and go easy on your body... you will see the changes in your flexibility and beyond after only a few weeks of doing them.

They are fantastic DVDs!!!! And they have me feel GREAT!! Just yesterday, I was telling my now-husband that I climbed a 3-story building through the stairs and felt so much lighter than I felt before, whenever I climbed that same building! So it does make your body quite strong and light at the same time, it's amazing!! I hate, HATE going to the gym and I wanted something that was low-impact but would still give me a workout I could look forward to everyday. And this is definitely it!! I have so much variety that I spend at least 5 minutes trying to decide which one I will do today! haha. I love how Tara explains how to move into each pose, you might think she talks too fast at first... but you do get used to it and get the hang of it after a couple of times. ;)

So if you want to either begin doing yoga or just keep on doing yoga if you already do it on a studio, this is a great choice to purchase! it has a lot of choices and levels you can follow according to your yoga-expertise.

I'm a first timer and I'll continue to do this, hopefully for as long as I can!!! :)
Good luck!!",1350000000,5,2203,4.188679245283019
5275552,5,B0096WOKWM,"I have been following Tara Stiles since she began on Ford Models' YouTube channel. Then I followed her onto her own channel. She's amazing. Her YouTube videos are amazing but a bit low resolution with grainy sound. You know, the typical YouTube video that is filmed from a webcam. But the material in her YouTube videos are great. But it is a bit harder to follow a routine from those videos.

When I found this DVD set for $20, I freaked out. It's such an amazing price for the quality and the content you are getting. So far, I have only done the second DVD which is for beginners. But Tara Stiles make yoga accessible to everything. She doesn't give you the technical terms of each pose. You will pretty much know the poses because they are pretty common. If not, watch the DVDs before embarking on your practice. It's so easy to grasp. There isn't any of those other yoga spirit stuff going on. Tara encourages you to find your own balance. Sometimes you don't need someone to tell you to think of a mantra but you just need to be told to breathe. Then you get the benefits without having to use your brain when you are winded up. I ended up feeling so much better after a quick 15 session with Tara without all the mantra stuff. That's how you know it's good. She doesn't try to sell you something. She just gives you yoga and once you feel the benefits, you are hooked.

This is yoga for everyone.",1349481600,4,1403,4.351145038167939
5275553,5,B0096WOKWM,I haven't flowed through all the routines yet but what I have done have been terrific!  There's the right mix of being easy enough for newbies but also opportunities to keep going in poses to further challenge if that's what's right for you. I'm looking forward to hopefully get into some of these advanced poses someday. And how about the value!?!  Hours & hours of yoga for only $20. I've seen videos with an hour of flow for close to $20 in the big box stores. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with these DVDs. I'm so glad I've got my set!! This is the next best thing to attending a class. Namaste Tara.,1348876800,2,616,4.394736842105263
5275554,5,B0096WOKWM,"tara stiles is such a fun yoga instructor! i love her style & how she makes yoga so approachable. i am having a great time exploring each of the dvds.
i highly recommend this dvd set & tara stiles. whether you have experience with yoga or not, this set is well worth it!
thanks for offering this awesome set, tara!",1348531200,,314,4.25
5275555,5,B0096WOKWM,"Tara Stiles' yoga workouts keep getting better & better! I own all of her dvds, and have been a fan of hers for years.  The music, production value, variety of background settings are SO great! {The Energy Flow & PM Flow Workouts are GENIUS~~especially b/c the sky behind her goes from sunset to nightfall} I've always loved Tara's approachable style, simple instruction {No Sanskrit terminology}, and sweet personality. She has been a total game-changer in my yoga practice, helping me to move up and out of the beginner phase, into a stronger, more confident one--which has carried over into other areas of my life. These workouts are for anyone and everyone, beginner and advanced.  I can't believe how much time & material we're getting for $20! THANK YOU, TARA for your generosity, time and passion! :)",1348099200,8,807,4.926470588235294
5275556,5,B0096WOKWM,"I've been a fan of Tara Stiles for a while and really enjoyed her videos, so when she came up with a set of her own I was excited to get it and it's at a great price! The DVDs come in all different levels and great for working your way up to balances and inversions. Beginners may think she moves fast, but once you get the hang of it you'll like her pace. The AM Flow in the morning is awesome to do when you first wake up. It wakens the body and rejuvenates you for the day. I highly recommend getting your day started with yoga. I also love that each session is not an hour long and even the 5 minute sessions are great too.
This is definitely a set to have in your home!",1348099200,,674,3.891304347826087
5275557,5,B0096WOKWM,"Wow!  Amazing collection of practicable yoga for everyone.  Nice combination of just the right amount of detailed how-to, alongside the kind of moving that helps everyone feel connected and great in their bodies.

Whether you're a brand new beginner or long-time practicer, you'll find lots that is extremely useful here.  Have five extra minutes?  Tara gives the perfect way to open up a trouble spot, heal an injury, or let go some stress.  Have a little more time?  Tara will get you connected to every inch of you, leaving you with an amazing feeling of expansiveness in your body and mind.

Tara has built a style of yoga that is incredibly useful in helping people create their own healthy, happy, capable lives.  Now we can get there right from home.",1348099200,,757,4.7615384615384615

8537113,5,B0096WOKWM,These are my favorite yoga DVDs.  Tara Stiles is very good at yoga instruction.  She explains the poses well and offers modifiers for each pose.,1493510400,,144,4.72

8537115,1,B0096WOKWM,"I have tried many, many times to do these videos and end up turning them off halfway through!!! She talks too fast and is generally confusing for a beginner...maybe even non-beginners too!  The times and descriptions don't match the covers on the back...so much so that I thought I had put the wrong DVD in the wrong case. I finished feeling frustrated and angry...not at all calm, rejuvenated or with an open body or mind. Off to meditate to get rid of this feeling!!!",1477440000,,469,4.583333333333333

8537117,5,B0096WOKWM,I love these DVDs and you get a lot of yoga sessions for a great price. Some people don't like her style of teaching since she talks fast and some people think it's hard to follow. I like her style and yoga routines and I like to listen and follow her along. Also love that it includes different types of routines depending on mood and energy. Just wish the encyclopedia of poses would come with a menu. But you can find same info online if needed. Not a big deal.,1462492800,,464,4.166666666666667
8537118,5,B0096WOKWM,"I mainly use only one of these. I think it's DVD 2. There's a 30-min am routine and 15-min gentle flow that I like to unwind with. I have tons of yoga DVDs but this is my favorite for how much better I feel afterward. Tara stiles does move quickly, so some experience with poses and alignment would be extremely helpful. I wouldn't buy this as a first-time intro to yoga",1454457600,,370,4.225352112676056
