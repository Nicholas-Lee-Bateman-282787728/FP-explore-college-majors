We get to hear Yeats' poetry read by a famous stage actress, Irene Worth! We get to explore some of Yeats'  major interests: art, the occult and Irish patriotism! What more could you possibly want in a 30 minute documentary?",1389916800,,371,4.983870967741935
7916814,1,B000035Z4T,One of the worst things I've ever seen.  You will learn nothing about Yeats from this tape.  And the recitation of his verse is stupifyingly reverential.  It was sad to see a great actress like Irene Worth involved with such fluff.  Yeats is one the great poets.  He deserves better than this.,974851200,9,293,4.5576923076923075
