8294925,5,B001DU47LO,"Starman DVD ~ David Bowie
Used & New from: $39.20
I found this dvd to be so interesting.  The interview's were well done. Angie Bowie , in my opinion, comes off as a control freak. She was trying to take credit for David's genius. I liked the interviews with the 2 ""Spiders from Mars"" member's left living.  Sad, this was not done when Mick Ronson could have been in the DVD.",1242864000,,375,4.267605633802817
