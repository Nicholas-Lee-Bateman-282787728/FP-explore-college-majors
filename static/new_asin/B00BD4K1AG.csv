8588017,1,B00BD4K1AG,Garbage.  Depressing experience.  Repulsive characters.  Weak casting.  Buy it so you can destroy it and save the planet.  I did.  Positive reviews must have been posted by friends and family.,1530144000,,192,5.233333333333333
8588018,5,B00BD4K1AG,"This is a ""truely"" redemptive story about growing up, through and out of child abuse.  The story line moves back and forth through time, thereby echoing the after effects.  Joey Lanai, writer and lead actor, is a talent with a supernatural spirit of survival.  He creates two new post modern archetypes with his parental characters: the Freakzoid Father, a walking incongruity expertly played by Thom Mulligan;  and the Malignant Mother, a child's embodiment of a living nightmare played by Kari Nissena.  Incongruity is a central theme throughout: loss and salvation, damnation and redemption. A theme brilliantly underscored by the watching of it.  At once you will be repulsed yet transfixed. The 3 Awards from the Independent Film Festival are well deserved. This film is deserving of an even wider audience.",1396569600,4,812,5.207692307692308
8588019,5,B00BD4K1AG,"Driven by the arresting performance of Kari Nissena, who plays a wicked mother who abuses her children for pleasure, this shocking look at a real-life, abusive household is a brave effort, indeed. Kudos to Director Joey Lanai for having the nerve to tell his story in such a raw and honest way.

The accomplishment is even more amazing when you consider the film's micro budget. A sophisticated viewer who values films that matter -- that have to be made because the story is so important to tell -- will appreciate this truly independent film. And the movie grabbed top honors at four film festivals. The ending is a little discordant with the rest of the story, but the strengths of Kari Nissena, whose performance is epic and most memorable, and the power of the imagery and dialogue, will haunt you long after the film has ended. Highly recommended.",1393113600,2,853,4.763513513513513

8588022,3,B00BD4K1AG,"Since no one else has reviewed this movie, I'll go first. It's not a terrible movie. It definitely isn't a good one, either, and I'm a little confused as to why it has received any awards.(It won the ""audience-favorite best picture award"" at Riverside; maybe that explains it.) Joey Lanai stars as Garrett Blackfoot, an abused child grown up to be a hard working single dad with all the odds against him. Lanai wrote the script and directed and produced the film. He may have bitten off more than he could chew. I didn't recognize anyone, so it's hardly a star-packed production. The acting of the main characters is OK, but many of the secondary characters seem amateurish. A few minor performances are cringe-worthy, (the bikers, thugs, and one secretary with an unbearable voice are among the worst). The film is as action-packed as any story about child abuse and disfunctional-family violence could be without going totally over the top. The cinematography isn't bad, although it seems like the the locations and sets were chosen with frugality as a top priority. The screenplay could have used a lot of work. All in all, I suppose they did the best they could with what they had to work with. The movie is watchable. Once again I fell for the multiple awards routine. No tears, no belly laughs, no deep insight, nothing really new, in fact, and, regrettably, I cannot recommend this film.",1373673600,,1394,4.788381742738589
