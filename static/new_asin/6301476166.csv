330666,4,6301476166,"Sleepaway Camp 3 differs greatly from Sleepaway Camp 2. It has Pamela Springsteen (who's still wonderfull as Angela as she was in part 2)playing Angela. This time around Angela the ""Angel of death"" poses as a camper at Camp New Horizons, the same camp where Rolling Hills was. It changed the name so nobody would recognize it as the same camp where Angela massacred the campers and coucilers. Poor kids and rich kids get together at Camp New Horizons and go on a four-day autom retreat(about 3 councilers and like 12 teenagers). We get are tough, mean kids and are nice kids. Angela starts murdering the campers and councilers one by one in very original ways. Angela has a rap song thats really cool and Pamela Springsteen and Tracy Griffith are wonderfull in the leading rolls. If you did not like part 2, you will not like part 3. But if you liked part 2, then you will like part 3.",1013904000,2,885,4.503105590062112

330760,5,6301476166,"I'll start this review on a firm note if you've never seen the Sleepaway Camp movies observe the covers of both Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3. The attractive 'camper' bearing a backpack containing a hockey mask and Freddy Krueger glove commonly found at a Halloween section in the 80's/early90's. Or on the cover of Sleepaway Camp 3 diverting your eyes to the endowed brunette. It's amusing how when these films came out Sleepaway Camp sequels lent this perspective of irony and humor which are big players in both of those films in marketing and reflect Angela's personality as a killer.

So what do I think of Sleepaway Camp 3?
Flat out if you like the Evil Dead movies...you'll like Angela's taste of vengeance and witty commentary. But less silly and more dark in comedic flavor. Hard to say which is my favorite between part 2 or 3 as they're both good in their own ways. The acting was decent. The plot wasn't bland as part of the story does involve what happened in part 2 so it fits. I see more taste in cinematography than I do from low-budget horror films made over the past 15 to 20 years. The actress Stacie Lambert (who plays as Jan Hernandez) definitely could have been gracing the postered walls of teenage boys as she was obviously the eye candy of this film. Nice old-school metal used in the credits.

Thinking back on the Sleepaway Camp films not surprised they weren't as monumental as say the Friday the 13th films. Alot of people tapped into the slasher genre and the idea of a camp theme was already taken which I feel the first Sleepaway Camp fed from as a non comedic slasher and the sequels generated it's own niche. Definitely a must add to anyone's slasher film collection though!",1452124800,,1701,4.573770491803279

330765,4,6301476166,"This is one of those guilty pleasure movies.  It's a cheaply made slasher film but I thought it was better than the usual of this genre.

Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's little sister) is the star of this one.  She's the cutest little bloodthirsty vicious homicidal maniac I've ever seen!  LOL!
Melanie Griffith's little sister is in here too.  Tracy is actually a heroine of sorts!

FYI, Pamela is now a successful photographer.  Maybe movies like this one made her think about a career change.  Too bad she didn't get the chance to be in better films because she does have style and talent, even in a story like this one.  Also, she's in a little homage to the Friday the 13th movies in one scene!

Turn off your thinking apparatus, have some popcorn, and enjoy the fun if you're into so-it's-bad-it's-good slasher films.",1443657600,3,819,4.704225352112676

330794,4,6301476166,"Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland takes place the following year after the events of Sleepaway Camp 2. The film opens with young Maria Nacastro, a rebellious teenage girl living with an unstable and dysfunctional family, leaving for camp. However she's suddenly chased off the road by a trash truck that runs her down dead. The driver is revealed to be Angela Baker who disposes of Maria's body in the back of the truck before stealing her identity and boarding a bus to Camp New Horizon. In a turn of events, Camp New Horizon was Camp Rolling Hill, where Angela killed the entire campsite before in Sleepaway Camp 2.

Unfortunately for Angela, the campers there are no different than any of the others from previous films. The campers consist of obnoxious male and females who are drug addicts, sex addicts, rebellious street thugs, rebellious rockers, and snobby rich kids. It gets even worse when a married couple who are the main founders and co-counselors of the camp are just as bad. One of the co-founders; Herman Miranda, is a perverted, sleazeball, ephebophile of an old man who is constantly looking to get in the pants of teenage girls. His wife, Lily Miranda is completely oblivious to her husband's vile ways, a mother figure to the campers--yet generally self-serving, lazy, demanding, and very selfish.

The good part for Angela is that the flaws with these characters leave her with a full plate of teen campers to be killed off. On the first day; the campers are split into 3 groups for the remaining camp session. The counselors for each group are Lily, Herman, and Barney Whitmore; a police officer and someone who Angela recognizes as the father of one of her previous camp victims. With Angela having a grievance with nearly everyone at Camp New Horizon, you can bet your bottom dollar that none of them will live to make it to the end of camp. Let the killing commence!

Overall: I won't lie; I enjoyed Sleepaway Camp 3 but not as much as I enjoyed the first 2 as unfortunately the series starts to decline a little here. At this point it was the same song and dance with the same setting. There were a few plot holes that need to be brought to light with this movie. For one, it's never revealed how Angela knew Maria or why she specifically wanted to kill her to take her identity. I think a better story build up would've made for a better understanding. Second, this Barney guy is a police officer, but he doesn't have a gun or handcuffs or anything else for that matter that a police officer should have to keep himself as well as the other campers safe (it'd soon come back to bite him). What kind of undercover cop works at a camp as a counselor but doesn't come prepared with any defense weapons?? Despite this; Barney Whitmore was probably the only lovable character in the entire film. Third, the plot is pretty thin. You NEVER make a horror movie that lacks true story telling. It also needs to be noted that the pace of this movie seemed rush. Not enough story telling with kill scenes happening way too fast way too often. Now seeing as how there's a slasher film and there were a couple of hotties in this movie; you'd think they'd take the time to give us a boob scene here or there, but all we got was a brief boob scene from the girls when they're changing their clothes. There was someone getting killed at least every 5 minutes. Other than those faulta with Sleepaway Camp 3, it still manages to pull off being a passably fun movie to sit through and was fairly well done. Some of the kill scenes are much more brutal than the previous 2 films. Despite a lot of faults, th This would mark the last Sleepaway Camp movie to feature Pamela Springsteen portraying Angela Baker. A Sleepaway Camp 4 sequel was planned for a 1992 release but it was put on the shelf for a whole 'nother 20 years, not being released until 2012. Overall, if you're a Pamela Springsteen fan, a Sleepaway Camp fan, or a slasher fan, you may very well enjoy this. If you've seen the last 2, you may not find it as compelling but have yourself some snacks to accompany you during its duration and it may just be worth your time",1438214400,,4140,4.524699599465954

330817,5,6301476166,"I just received the Blu Ray and have to say they did a fantastic job. For super hardcore fans of the film, the ""workprint"" version is pretty interesting. They add most of the deleted gore but it is missing the music and most of the sound effects. But what I wasn't expecting was a lot of alternate takes or longer scenes. Some are subtle but for a hardcore fan like me that's seen the movie a number of times, it was fun seeing some of the scenes play out a bit longer.

The special features are carried over from the DVD, plus a new behind the scenes feature and an awesome old school and very cheesy home video trailer, and the aforementioned workprint version.

So if your a huge fan I do recommend checking out this Blu Ray, I did have a lot of fun with the workprint version, but if your just a casual fan then the DVD should suffice.",1435276800,,839,4.204968944099379

330855,4,6301476166,"Master Figueroa has put together a series of effective Chen style Tai-Chi lessons. The program for me was a bit slow at first, however, the lessons go into a lot of detail explaining the moves. Once I understood Master Figueroa's style, the lessons began to make more sense and I found myself 'getting' the form and the use of Fa Jing. I recommend this for anyone who is either grounded in Chen style Tai-Chi or is familiar with say Yang form. These lessons are not about a certain routine: for example, Master Figueroa does not demonstrate a complete form' at the beginning of the series. This series for me is about developing the FaJing power. The lessons teach the proper breathing, preparatory warm ups, silk reeling and ""Standing Post"" forms to prepare one for Fa Jing as applied to the Chen style Tai Chi. Fa Jing is coordinating the breathe exhalation, body movement and coordinated strikes using minimum effort for maximum effect. It's not that easy to do well, and I believe that this program from Disk 1 to Disk III is really for someone who knows a complete form -- whether Yang, Wu or Sun or better yet Chen -- and has some knowledge of what Fa Jing could be.
For these students, Master Figueroa's lessons II and III would help them develop power and strength in their moves.",1416787200,,1288,4.604347826086957

And join she does, slashing and hacking right into the camping spirit. Angela takes this group of campers for a bumpy ride.

330861,5,6301476166,"Well guess what everybody- it's been 24 long YEARS since I watched this movie.  After countless google searches typing in key words describing certain scenes that take place throughout Sleepaway Camp III (including the memorable lawnmower segment- heads up!) I came up empty time and time again.  I was getting frustrated.  I just could not get any results matching the movie I *knew* I thoroughly enjoyed as a youngster.  Even though I was only 8 years old back in 1989, I *knew* this movie actually exists- I just didn't know the name of it.  Finally, after giving in and asking on a message board, I got my wish!  All this time the name of the film is Sleepaway Camp III.  I had NO idea this was actually part of a series.  Now I'm curious to watch the first two!

Well let's be honest- the movie holds up alright I suppose, but my very noticeable and extra polite 5-star rating is pretty much given as a result of precious childhood memories.  I can't really give a fair and objective review- hope you can understand.  Either way I'm going to love and praise this film because I haven't seen it in so many years.  I sort of missed it like a childhood toy.  Well... almost, haha.  I honestly wasn't sure if the day would ever come when I'd get the opportunity to watch it again.  So... does Sleepaway Camp hold up?  Yes and no.

The one part I could NOT remember clearly is who exactly the bad guy is.  I could have sworn it was the older woman that's the camp counselor/instructor, but it's actually the young girl in disguise played by the talented and VERY beautiful Pamela Springsteen.  She totally reminds me of current WWE diva AJ Lee!

It should go without saying that if you like cheesy violence and gore, you will most likely appreciate this movie.  If you love watching people die in fairly creative ways, you'll love Sleepaway Camp III.  However the one issue I have is that some of these segments are truly beyond cheesy and just look terrible.  The scene with Pamela Springsteen smacking a man unconscious (or to death) was pretty lousy since she was clearly missing him.  Come on, even WWE portrays such violence more believably, haha.  He *easily* could have overpowered her.  However for every less than spectacular death, we have some really good ones such as the above mentioned ""lawnmower over the head"" death, the flag-raising segment (don't speak out of line while blindfolded!) and perhaps the best one- the firecracker in the mouth explosion, LOL!  This last one was TOTALLY justified.  You'll see why.  Having Pamela Springsteen seem so innocent and willing to lend help when needed is a great piece of writing too.  I mean who could have possibly suspected SHE'S the one behind all the murders around camp?

Some of the writing is fairly unpredictable too.  There's a few people I seriously did NOT think would end up dying but, well, they do.  There's a few surprises in this regard.  I *do* find it extremely clever that the murderer was actually one of the teens that tried to blend in and be part of the group, only to find herself always able to create the perfect murder scenario with nobody finding out about it until the end.  I believe there's elements of mockery in the writing too.  Other reviewers here mention this as well.  This would explain why several deaths aren't even *remotely* possible in the real world.  Come on, dragging a girl up a flagpole by hooking onto her back pants and having her drop on her face from high above?  I'm pretty sure -make that 100% sure- the moment she lifts off the ground she'd take the blindfold off and immediately turn around to see what's going on.

Still, I love this movie.  Childhood memories make me feel like I *have* to.  Sorry!",1363996800,,3716,4.602134146341464

330863,4,6301476166,Angela's back once again played by Pamela Springteen to kill anyone who does something no where as good as part 1 and not as good as part 2 but a pretty good sequel.,1346457600,,165,4.03030303030303
330864,3,6301476166,"Filmed back-to-back with Sleepaway Campers 2: Unhappy Campers, this third installment in the series falls quite a bit short of its predecessor and the unforgettable original.  To the filmmakers' credit, they once again adapt their stylistic approach, refusing to merely copy what they had done before.  As we enter this Teenage Wasteland (a nod to director Michael Simpson's fondness for The Who), we are now fully in horror-comedy mode.  In that context, the movie is successful, as our killer tops off each kill with a one-liner and, but this approach ultimately lessens the impact of this film on the viewer.  This is something of a robotic experience, lacking any of the emotion that attached itself to the nascent comedic aspects of the first sequel.  Despite her prolific and heinous crimes, the Angela of Sleepaway Camp 2 was a somewhat sympathetic character.  There was a depth and a degree of sadness to her character - if only those campers hadn't misbehaved and broken the rules, then she wouldn't have had to kill them.  Only at the end of Teenage Wasteland does that kind of ambivalence reappear; up to that point, she's just a killing machine.

Angela is a true anti-hero this time around, and you won't even have to feel guilty for rooting her own once you meet the gang at Camp New Horizons.  Set in the very location of Camp Rolling Hills (where Angela massacred all the campers a year ago), Camp New Horizons is an ""experiment in sharing,"" bringing together six underprivileged teens alongside six teens from wealthy homes.  Stereotypes abound.  By and large, the poor kids are all juvenile delinquents of one kind or another, and the rich kids are snooty, racist brats.  Only two out of the bunch are even remotely likeable.  The camp itself is the brainchild of lecherous oddball Herman (Michael J. Pollard) and Lily Miranda, with Officer Barney Whitmore (Cliff Brand) volunteering as the third counselor.  This presents a possible problem for Angela (who killed and took the place of one of the underprivileged campers) because Barney's son was one of her victims a year ago.

The storyline is pretty simple.  The campers divide up into three groups, which makes it a lot easier for Angela to take out her victims one by one.  She employs various killing tools and techniques, from the basic (beating) to the sublime (flagpole).  She seems to enjoy the killings this time around (even putting together a rap song at one point), but her heart just doesn't seem to be in it the way it was in the previous sequel.  The same could be said of the film as a whole, as Angela just seems to be going through the motions this time around.  Pamela Springsteen still turns in another good performance, but there's nothing about this film that really sets it apart from the crowd of similar films in the genre.",1345248000,,2819,4.797101449275362
330902,4,6301476166,"I've read like a zillion reviews on here about how this movie (along with the second one) are not scary and the reviewer acts like they had no idea that it would be a horror comedy. First of all, read the back of the box. That should say enough. And the cover doesn't really scream horror either. Maybe you should do your homework before watching a movie, read some reviews and see what you're in store for. But that just really bugs the crap out of me...

Anyway, on to the movie. While I perfer ""Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers"", I like this one second best. The original is alright, but it has bad acting. I'm sure you could say 2 & 3 have bad acting, but these movies also aren't being serious. The original takes it's self too seriously. Anyway, part 3 is kinda a replica of 2 with an ending that is slighty more satisifying. There's not as much gore, the characters aren't exactly likeable like the sequal. I personally loved Ally, lol. But you'll probably be cheering for Angela the entire time. So if you liked part 2, then watch this. But go in with an open mind and make sure that you don't expect to see HORROR because it's NOT supposed to be SCARY. Alright? Okay.

330903,2,6301476166,"<strong>Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland</strong> (Michael A. Simpson, 1989)

After suffering through the first two movies in the Sleepaway Camp franchise, I have to wonder what on earth possessed me to go onto the third, other than a burning desire to finish the box set and get it out of my house. But I have to admit...despite the third being the lowest-budget movie of them all, and despite it being basically shot as leftovers from the second film (the two movies were shot back-to-back with the same locations, etc., an old Roger Corman ""how to make movies for five hundred bucks"" trick), I think it's the strongest of the three, for reasons we'll delve into eventually.

Plot: a year after the events of the second film, an enterprising older couple, Herman and Lily Miranda (Michael J. Pollard, nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his work in <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em>, and <em>Norma Rae</em>'s Sandra Dorsey) and  uses the spot for an experimental sort of camp: it will bring together teenagers from both sides of the tracks in an attempt to get them to better understand one another's lives. You can already tell how well this is going to work. In any case, Angela slips in by offing one of the inner-city campers with a garbage truck in the movie's funniest scene, then catching her ride back to Angela's old stomping grounds, where she quickly discovers that, yet again, the campers don't live up to her expectations. (At one point, in frustration, she yells, ""why did I expect things to be different this year?"" Indeed.) As with the last film, where she had Molly, she discovers one camper with a generally sweet nature, Marcia (<em>The First Power</em>'s Tracy Griffith). Maybe she'll finally find someone worth saving?

The Sleepaway Camp movies were always about cardboard cutouts getting killed, but there's actually a glimmer of characterization in this one between Marcia and one of the underprivileged kids, Tony (<em>2012</em>'s Mark Oliver), with whom she strikes up a tentative relationship. (I don't know if it's a spoiler, so I'll tell you to skip to the end of this parenthesis if you don't wanna know: there's a <em>great</em> one-liner at the end that shows just how off Angela is in reading Marcia's character. But if you're not paying attention, you might miss it.) I guess it couldn't be helped, since the idea behind Fritz Godron's script pretty much forced examination of some social issues--and did so in at least slightly more sensitive a way than did the idiocy of the first film. I wish there'd been more of that sort of thing; you can't put an Asian woman who goes by the name ""Arab"" in a movie and <em>not</em> explore that, though they do here--but someone at least made the effort in a few places. Don't get me wrong, it's just as dumb as the first two, but at least it's dumb with a scrim of substance. **",1307664000,,2854,4.794715447154472

Camp New Horizons opens its doors to a group of inner-city youths, but what the councilors don't know is that the infamous Angela Baker has killed one of their teens and taken her place amongst the campers! Pamela Springsteen returns in another hilarious performance as everyone's favorite transvestite killer with plenty more tricks up her sleeve. While many of the teen characters are barely passable in this third outing, TEENAGE WASTELAND takes full advantage of the idiotic extras by raking in the largest body count in the series. The censored deaths are far less bloody than intended due to the strict scrutiny the MPAA showed against the Slasher genre towards the end of the decade, but one needs look no further than the Special Features on the DVD release to cash in on the gory leftovers. Michael A. Simpson makes up for it by packing in all of the same great nudity and cheesy humor from before, making this another highly entertaining (if not utterly stupid) camp classic!

You're not hiding anything by changing the name of the campgrounds (in this case, from Rolling Hills to New Horizons), it's not going to help if one of the camp counsellors is a police officer (whose son was decapitated in Part 2) and you can't rule out the killer coming back to the scene of the crime if still on the loose (yes, Angela is back, incognito as another scheduled camper whose identity she stole... after running her over with a trash service truck!). Oh sure, the theme involving bringing upper and lower class teens together as one is a nice thought, but will it matter if they're all dead at the end of the day? Pamela Springsteen playfully reprises her role with ease, doing away with anyone involved with fornication, criminal mischief and/or just bad attitudes.

330908,4,6301476166,"I've gotten into the habit recently of watching horror movie sequels back-to-back and then reviewing them.  I thought perhaps I was being anti-social, so I recently watched all four SLEEPAWAY CAMPS on four consecutive dates with the same girl.  See?  I'm not antisocial.  Just weird.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp/dp/6305841985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;-- The original movie is bizarre, to say the least.  After a mild opening in which most of a family is killed with a speedboat, the movie cuts to two children, Ricky and Angela, being shipped off to Camp Arawak by Angela's mom, a ludicrously spacy woman.  Angela, the surviving daughter from the movie's intro, appears to be mute.  Ricky dutifully cares for her throughout the movie.  Aside from an old black cook and a well-meaning but clueless counselor named Ronnie, the rest of the cast is almost entirely composed of mean, selfish, antagonistic people.  But, phew!  They start getting killed.

The first person to kick the bucket at camp is a lecherous cook who openly brags about his pedophilia.  He's not kidding, either.  When he is introduced to Angela during lunch, in his busy kitchen, the first thing he does is drag her into a supply closet with the intention of exposing himself (and probably more).  Later, he has a large tureen of boiling water dumped onto his head.  Zing!

The movie tries to make itself mysterious, but it's not hard to figure out who's doing the killing.  Every time Angela is picked on in some way, the person eventually bites it in some overly dramatic and silly deaths.  However, although the whodunit of it is not a big surprise, there's still a lot of mystery to the movie.  Specifically, my date and I wondered how it ever got made.  The budget appears to have been twenty dollars, and -- up to that point -- both of us claimed to never have seen such horrific acting.  It was a stupid, poorly contrived, horribly done film, and the writer/director, Robert Hiltzick, had dedicated the entire thing to his late mother, a woman the dedication describes as ""a doer.""

We couldn't stop laughing.  I don't think the film was meant to be so funny.  Maybe it was.  Maybe that's where the phrase ""campy"" came from.  Either way, we enjoyed ourselves.  Four (accidental?) stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp-II-Unhappy-Campers/dp/B00006ADDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp II - Unhappy Campers</a>&nbsp;-- The very first thing that happens in this film: Angela (same character, different actress), is now a counselor at Camp Rolling Hills.  Within the first two minutes of the film, she bludgeons a female camper and then cuts out her tongue, punishment for sneaking over to the boy's camp and telling scary bonfire stories.  Angela, apparently, is like a camp chastity Nazi or something.  My date is disgusted and already regretting her decision.

It's obvious right away that this film is not only far more graphic and explicit (when the girls aren't topless and joking about their breasts, they are trying to get slutty with each other's boyfriends), but it is also not interested at all in suspense or drama.  Angela kills every single person without even a ""how do you do?""  That might sound like a spoiler, but this movie doesn't have any secrets or tricks up its sleeve.  A camp of sinners and sleazeballs gets sliced and diced.  The end.

There is a subplot concerning the two wholesomest kids in camp finding each other amidst all the devious tramps and the people being stabbed and drowned in outhouses, but these kids were apparently only halfsome, because, as I pointed out, they die along with everyone else.  But I guarantee you, I didn't ruin the movie for you.  No.  This movie is just another dumb, horribly written and directed film that is actually pretty funny.  Just as funny as the first one, though.

My date refused to finish it after the outhouse scene.  Four stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp-III-Teenage-Wasteland/dp/B00006ADDF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp III - Teenage Wasteland</a>&nbsp;-- In the first two minutes of this film, the viewer is treated to more pointless nudity and a death by garbage truck (driven by Angela).  She is now on her way to Camp New Horizons, an ill-advised social experiment that forces juvenile delinquents and spoiled rich kids into tents together.  This place is run by a dangerously idiotic couple and seems to have little to no funding.  The only person with any degree of dignity is the camp's only counselor (!) a guy named Barney who is also an officer of the law AND the father of a camper who died in the previous film.

The dialogue and acting in this film make the first two look like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>.  The characters make wild, irrational decisions.  People are despicable for no good reason, and Angela never struggles with finding the time, energy, and secrecy to dispatch of most of them.  She is aided by the fact that this camp, like the previous two, seems to have no schedule of events or basic supervision.  In fact, budget constraints must be lower than ever, because this time around the place appears to be run out of two woodsheds.  And yet, in the credits, there is this: Mr. Simpson's Porsche Provided by MEGDAL IMPORTS.  Mr. Simpsons is the director, and to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor his Porsche appear in the film.  Another horrible horror movie that we couldn't stop laughing at.

My date said that the acting was even worse than the first film.  She gave it two thumb up.  Me: Four stars.

NOTE: THERE IS APPARENTLY A FOURTH FILM SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.  I COULD NOT FIND IT, NOR KNOW ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO VOUCH FOR ITS EXISTENCE.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Sleepaway-Camp/dp/B001CT876C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;-- The creator, Hiltzik, was not responsible for parts 2 or 3.  They were the work of writer Fritz Gordon and director Michael Simpson.  For some wild reason, Hiltzik, who'd done NOTHING since the first film (according to iMDB), decided to make a REAL sequel to his first film.  This is it, a movie so absolutely awful in every way, I found it nothing short of mesmerizing and have watched it twice again since.

It's obvious that Hiltzik is catering to his fans, because the first death is almost identical to the first death in the first film: rude cook dies by hot liquid.  The head cook is, yet again, an elderly black man (Isaac Hayes who acts in every scene as if he has recently gone blind).  Muscley, dim-witted Ronnie is back as the head counselor.  Reprising his role from the original, Paul DeAngelo makes bad acting look like a fine art.  I'm not joking.  I could watch that guy overact for hours and hours.

The camp is run by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos/dp/B001C3O6R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos</a>'s Vincent Pastore, and is once again filled with the most mean-spirited, vile children ever.  The kids are so rude and unruly, when they are punished for their misbehavior (by being sent to their cabins), I'm surprised they don't just hit the counselor with a rock.  The hammy acting will astound you.  The dialogue will baffle and delight.  Even the extras in this film are as weird and wooden as life-sized cardboard puppets.

The plot this time around is not very different at all.  One camper, a kid named Alan, is the butt of everyone's jokes, and those who taunt and tease him end up meeting grisly ends.  The thing is, Alan is the whiniest and most annoying movie character since Luke Skywalker.  Played with absolutely no consistency at all by Michael Gibney, Alan is the movie's most confusing character.  Does this boy have a mental disorder?  Is he schizophrenic?  Why does he love frogs so much?  Why doesn't he ever, ever, ever change his clothes?  Why is he such a jerk?

Yes.  Alan is just as annoying and mean as everyone else, and yet when the camp gangs up on him and shoots spit balls at him or yells at him to stop making flamethrowers out of lighters and spray cans, he starts complaining that everyone is picking on him because ""he's different.""  He chats with his brother about a mysterious ""fever.""  ""The doctor said there'd always be effects,"" Alan moans as he pets a frog.

It makes no sense.  Nor does the rest of the film.  The original actors who portrayed Ricky (Jonahan Tiersten) and Angela (Felissa Rose) reprise their roles here, which is a bit of a treat.  Tiersten has obviously done no acting since the first film.  He doesn't even bother looking interested, casually smoking a cigarette during a tense hunt in the woods for the bodies of slain children.  Rose isn't exactly recognizable for much of the film, but it won't be hard to know point her out after about ten minutes.  My date did it in twelve.

My date hated the film.  So did my neighbor, who refused to watch anymore after about thirty minutes.  But me?  I couldn't get enough.  It is, without question, the most hilariously awful film I've seen since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000OVLBHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>.  I chuckle now just thinking about it.

I see that Hiltzik has started production on a SLEEPAWAY CAMP REUNION.  Bravo, Mr. Hiltzik.  I doubt very much that you'll be able to top the inane silliness, the incomprehensibly horrible acting, the deliciously cheesy plot ""twists,"" but I'll be glad to watch you try.

330911,4,6301476166,"At first most people will probably see Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland has yet another slasher movie in the seemingly never ending slashers of the 1980s. But Sleepaway Camp III has a lot more going on than people might realize and is one of the smarter slasher flicks to come out in the 80s. Upon its release the slasher film was all but dead. And all creativity was pretty much dead. There were a few filmmakers still trying to get that one last film out, but none of these flicks were making much money anymore with the exception of the major franchises, but 1989 even saw the franchises take a major hit in box office numbers.

But where those movies failed is where Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland succeeds. Many people miss the point of the Sleepaway Camp sequels. I often hear was that supposed to be scary? It was more funny than scary. Yes people that were the point of the sequels! The makers of the Sleepaway Camp sequels were making more of a parody of the slasher genre. While movies like Scream get praised for that the Sleepaway Camp sequels are ignored.

Slasher flicks often have what one can say a morality tale; even if that wasn't the intention of the filmmakers it seems like you have sex you die, take drugs you die, stuck up you die. If you're obnoxious you die. The only person to normally survive these movies is the innocent virginal girl. And that is what the Sleepaway Camp sequels play up to. Both Sleepaway Camp sequels are really a lot smarter than people give them credit for.

I thought the first Sleepaway Camp was alright, the main reason for the cult status is due to the ending. If not for that I doubt the original would be as remembered as it is. But I just love Sleepaway Camp II and III. Both are just so much fun. Check your brain at the door and just enjoy the ride.

Writer Fritz Gordon delivers one hell of a funny screenplay. First up all the characters are pretty much named off characters from West Side Story, The Brady Bunch and the Munsters so right there that should clue you in that this is a spoof more than a straight up horror flick. Slasher flicks are so well known for their sex, nudity and obnoxious characters and Fritz Gordon nails that big time.

All the characters are very obnoxious with the exception really of a couple of them. But you see that was the point, all of that was the intention. Fritz Gordon writes a very clever spoof, but due to the slapstick comedy it gets lost on too many viewers and they take the movie too serious.

Director Michael Simpson doesn't try and play these scenes straight. He knows what he has to do and boy does he ever deliver. The running time is only about 77-minutes so there really isn't a slow moment. Simpson plays up to all the slasher clichs and spoofs them. Also Simpson and Gordon seem to do the impossible and actually create original kill scenes.

Most of the movie is shot during the day with the final act taking place at night. Most horror movies work best with a nighttime setting, but in Sleepaway Camp III is the exception. Since the movie wasn't meant to be the typical horror flick the mostly daytime scenes actually work quite well. Michael Simpson gets the job done here all of his scenes play out well. He knows what then audience wants and he delivers that. You get nudity and gore that's what the slasher movie is all about.

Pamela Springsteen returns as Angela Baker and again knocks it out of the ballpark with a really funny and very entertaining performance. Angela is pretty much the anti-hero. The viewers will be rooting for her all the way through. In most horror movies when you are rooting for the villain that normally means the makers didn't do a good job on the characters, but Angela was the anti-hero and we are meant to cheer for her. It might sound weird that we wanna see Angela kill the characters off, but it works well. I can honestly say Angela is by far my favorite character in a slasher flick. Not so much the original Angela played by Felissa Rose, who was very good in her installment, but for me it's Pamela all the way.

Angela after dispatching one of her victims always has a one-liner, which might be a bit silly, but again that's the point. Angela is often over-looked among the Iconic horror movie killers, but she is by far my favorite.

As I stated the kill scenes are original; we get one girl tied to a flag pole and raised up than dropped right on her head. I just love Angela's line as she raises her up when the victims asks why, Angela says, ""Because you're a cheerleader, a fornicator, a drug taker, a nasty snotty bigot and besides that... you're real nice.""

We also get a firecracker up the nose, a girl getting rundown by a garbage truck, one guy tied to a tree with a rope and the other part of the rope tied to a truck, which results in him getting ripped a part and the and what might be my favorite death by lawnmower. If people watching these crazy over the top kill scenes still don't understand this movie isn't meant to be taken serious well I don't even know what to say.

I also love the characters in Sleepaway Camp III all of them are so much fun. Bobby Stark played by Haynes Brooke was one of the best, when asked what his favorite movie is he replies with, ""Ones that make America look great, like Rambo Part III, Great movie."" Riff played by Daryl Wilcher is another great character. Everything he says is pretty much a four letter word, but it's really funny.

The tradition of Sleepaway Camp is in every movie there is some kind of decapitation. And I love the part when Angela says, ""It seems every year I'm at camp someone loses their head.""  It just little things like that is what makes me love the Sleepaway Camp sequels.

The character of Barney Whitmore played by Cliff Brand is the more serious character. He's the father of one of the characters killed by Angela in Sleepaway Camp II. The guy is hell-bent on wanting revenge on Angela, and when he realizes Angela is at the camp you expect this big showdown. But Angela takes him out rather easily; some people complained about that, but remember these movies are about Angela. She may be the killer, but she's also the heroine in a sense.

Though Sleepaway Camp III also does have a bit of a twist, Marcia played by Tracey Griffith isn't so innocent like we thought she was. I thought that was an interesting twist considering most of these movies rarely offer a twist on the final girl.

Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland may not go down as one of the Iconic horror films, but when it comes to just sheer fun you'll be hard pressed to find one more than Sleepaway Camp III.",1213747200,19,6639,4.4376026272577995

But nonetheless, I felt compelled to at least watch it once more before writing my review. Basically, this sequel is made in the same style as Sleepaway Camp II. More dumb humor, poor acting, and weak plot. Pamela Springsteen reprises her role as Angela Baker aka ""The Angel of Death"", and I must say, her acting performance was worst than that of Sleepaway II, which is pretty hard to accomplish! Yes, the storyline was pretty lame, but once again, is was the humor in this one that got me again. During almost every kill, Angela had some stupid one-liner to say, which really got on my nerves. Most of the characters were way over-the-top stereotypes, I suppose that was done on purpose, but nonetheless, it was dumb. They even took a jab at the Friday the 13th movies. Someone should have told the director that they did that bit in the Sleepaway 2!!! Not only that, the acting of Pamela Springsteen  makes it basically unbelievable that she could brutally murder anyone. In most kill scenes, she looks like she's using the force of a 5 year-old!!! Of course, the movie ends with Angela surviving, and delivering yet again, another dumb one-liner to end the film. I'm not even sure why I'm giving this film 2 stars, I would say it's more like a 1.5, and I'm being a bit generous with that. But since the storyline does at least follow along with the other films and there are a couple of cool kill scenes, I'll be bit more kind on my rating.",1189987200,,1562,4.5587188612099645

I don't remember watching the first of the sequel.

I can't believe Bruce Springsteen's sister acts in this. He must be humiliated by it as she can't act!  The acting overall, as in many of the camper type horror movies, is horrendous!  Got 90 minutes to ""waste""? Like stupid horror movies with really bad acting? Then by all means, watch this stinker.

However, Angela(the killer and The Boss's sis) certainly found some very interesting and original ways to kill people.  Also, the scene where she is fishing and pulls up a hockey mask is sort of funny, as I'm sure it was meant to be.  It seemed fitting and almost makes this film look like more of a spoof of the genre as opposed to an actual scary movie.

""Sleepaway Camp III - Teenage Wasteland"" is no exception and probably the best picture from this trilogy. It's also probably one of the best examples of a teen 80's/90's kitschy horror picture.

""Sleep away Camp III"" has it all, hot girls, a friendly yet sadistic murderer, and lots of blood! ""Sleepaway Camp III"" finds Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) back in the woods. This time Angela reinvents herself as a misfit from the inner city so she can blend in with the other campers.

Lilly (Sandra Dorsey) and Herman Miranda (Michael J. Pollard) have  turned the former campgrounds (of ""Sleepaway Camp II"") into ""Camp New Horizons."" Lilly is a lazy old bag that doesn't want to move, she's just in it for the money and publicity. And Herman is a horny old dude that enjoys playing hide the weasel with one of the female campers. Suffice it to say, Angela isn't very happy about all of this...

Angela is actually a very sweet girl (on the surface). She enjoys camping and working with others, and really enjoys sports games and the outdoors. She just gets really ticked off when people do stupid things. So what does Angela do? She simply kills them in a very inventive way. For example, Lilly got her head mowed over with a lawn mower.

Comcast recently added ""Sleepaway Camp III"" to their new ""FEARnet"" section of on-demand movies so I got to watch it again and got a good laugh at all of the kooky antics of the campers. My favorite camper (besides Angela, of course) is Snowboy (Kyle Holman) because he's such a fool; just imagine what Angela does when she gets her hands on him...

In a way, Angela is like the ""Borat"" of the 80's because she exposed a lot of stupidity and narrow-mindedness among teens. As Angela said, ""just taking care of business...""",1168128000,20,1930,4.661764705882353
330937,1,6301476166,I saw this movie on on demand and I would have to say it is the worst slasher film I had ever seen. The characters are really bad in this movie. The killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl. The way she kills people is so weak. She beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak. It does not even look like it would hurt you. And he some how dies. The movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone. Most of them did  nothing. Don't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad. And it is not even scary at all. It takes place for the most part in the day time. And the killer is the main character making no suspense at all. I would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost. It is so stupid. I really don't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about. All I can say is it is UTTER TRASH!!!!!,1168128000,,870,3.7540983606557377
330938,4,6301476166,"Got to say this may have been the best one of the 3 Sleepaway Camps. It follows the same basic plot as the first 2 films. A bunch of young campers end up dead through creative ways. I am amazed at how creative Angela (Pam Springstein) is in killing off the fornicating youth. I was really getting to admire Angela's determination at killing off those who spite her or clash with her values.

All in all Sleepaway Camp III is suprisingly a good end to a decade old slasherflick and the ending leaves the door open for a 4th movie, although Sleepaway Camp IV (2002) was canceled after 2 weeks of shooting.

If they ever decide to make another Sleepaway Camp, Pam Springstein has to play Angela, she makes the film, maybe this time they will use her brother for the soundtrack...",1160352000,,776,4.457746478873239
330939,4,6301476166,"Basically, the killer Angela has returned and is killing off all of the bratty girls and boys while they are setting up camp.

This film puts the 'camp' in Sleepaway Camp.  Pure, cheeseball entertainment.  It's worth the 5 bucks that's being charged!",1141430400,,250,4.904761904761905
330940,3,6301476166,"While lacking the sticky charm of ""UNHAPPY CAMPERS""! Michael A. Simpson's second effort & 3rd film of the Sleepaway saga ""Sleepaway Camp 3(TEENAGE WASTELAND)"" is still a pretty damn fun slasher flick with some offbeat humor,great kills & one of the largest bodycounts in slasher movie history. Pamela Springsteen again takes care of buisiness as the devilish 'angel of death' Angela Baker!",1127347200,,389,5.290322580645161
330961,2,6301476166,"Honestly, I can't really remember the first two because

it has been so long since I seen them.... But I doubt

this one was the best. We have Bruce Springsteens sister

going around killing all the teens in the camp that

commits sins. Well, I'll say that there is a few semi

original killings here. But there is no reason to root

for anyone in the film other than the killer. The asian

girl is totally annoying as is the rest of the cast.

This movie in some ways attempt to be a horror movie and

in other ways it wanted to be a spoof movie. Reality is

that it failed on both accounts as it isn't scary or

really that funny.",1114473600,,632,4.098360655737705
330962,5,6301476166,"Everyone's favorite psycho camp leader is back. This time Angela is disguised as a camper and runs amok in an experimental campground where the priviledged are in the woods with gangstas and hooligans.

Angela doesn't even try to hide the bodies in this one. She just goes around killing everyone in sight. Broad daylight murders and the bodies are left there to rot. My favorite was when she ran the chick up the flagpole and let her go from the top. Her head crashed into the pavement and Angela doesn't even look at her corpse for a second, she just skips off.

There is a father of a victim from part II and he's a cop/counselor. There's no melodrama here. He just asks Angela how she plans on killing him. With a smile she pulls a .45 from behind her back and blows him away! No buildup, no suspense, just senseless killing.

There could have been more nudity in this, but who am I to complain. The cabin in the beginning was full of topless girls. Well all except for Angela who needs a 'can-opener' to get out of her 1950's brassierre.

But I think we can all thank Angela when she kills the rap gangsta (who listened to god-awful rap). When he turned on his boom box for the last time, Angela had a surprise waiting message on the tape! HA ha, jolly good fun.

The last two kills set you up for the highly anticipated Sleepaway Camp IV. She kills the two medics in the back of an ambulance.",1113696000,4,1398,4.340996168582375

330964,1,6301476166,"What a dissapointment! After the fun of ""Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers"", theres this; one of the worst and stupidest movies I've ever seen. It just SUCKS! It could have been better if there had been more campers. Also, if the little campers there were weren't actually out camping the whole time in tents. And most of the deaths take place during the day, and there are no likeable charectors; well, except Angela, but she just seems depressed thorughout the whole thing. She barely says anything or acts funny at all! There are survivors in this one, a guy and a girl, but I didn't even care becuase they weren't even all that likeable. Why couldin't they have let Molly, a good charector survive in the last one, but had stupid Marsha and the Mexican guy survive in this one??? And it's just very borng for the most part, and the deaths are weak, and there's barely any gore. There IS another dead-bodies-ina-cabin thing at the end, but it's so dark in there, you can't even see anything! SOOOO not reccomended!",1088726400,2,1017,4.624309392265193

330968,3,6301476166,"SLEEPAWAY CAMP III - TEENAGE WASTELAND is much like the second film.  Pamela Springsteen is back as Angela only this time, she kills a girl, steals her identity and goes to the new camp with a new set of campers on the same grounds where Angela murdered her victims the year before.  An appropiate subtitle, this is a good film to watch if youhave an hour and a half to waste.  Teenage Wasteland fun !!!!
This film is presented for the first time in 1.85:1 widescreen and the sound and picture quality are good for a film that was made on a very low budget.
