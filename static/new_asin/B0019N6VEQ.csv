8274839,1,B0019N6VEQ,What on earth is the point of Region coding old movies? They do not have a release date to protect. With Blu-ray classics you probably already have the DVD.So thanks a bunch Fox you stupid mean spirited bunch of bean counters.,1260921600,2,226,4.536585365853658
8274840,4,B0019N6VEQ,"Ok Patton, the longest day both classic war movies. Both set the standard for early retro war movies. But the sand pebbles what is that doing in the mix its not even a war movie. Eh well Hollywood they simply don't watch their own movies. Sand pebbles is ok but really hard to get into as it has no real story just when your starting to understand how a USA riverboat warship operates in China before WWII then the movie changes direction almost like what happened prior to the revolution of the warlords didn't matter at all. Its one crazy movie.",1245024000,,547,4.425742574257426
8274841,1,B0019N6VEQ,the movies are great but if you buy these 3 films separately from amazon it's 66.00 total so why would you pay 107 for the bundle.,1244073600,6,130,4.038461538461538
8274842,5,B0019N6VEQ,"The only thing I have to say is that all of these are great movies from the 60s. I really like ""The Sand Pebbles"" as I think it is one of Steve McQueens best movie. The sound and picture quality of these are remade better than the original as I have watched these movies many times.
If you like war flicks, this is the bundle for you.",1229040000,,334,4.0
8274843,5,B0019N6VEQ,The clarity of the Blu-ray is stunning to say the least.  All three movies are incredible and a must see.,1225065600,2,105,4.25
