1808698,1,B00007G200,"This Hawass guy who runs the Giza plateau doesn't have any imagination.  This is unfortunate because the so called scientific evidence about how the Great Pyramid was built (and probably more importantly why it was built) is flimsy.

I believe the theory presented by Christopher Dunn in his book 'The Giza Power Plant'. The Great Pyramid was a machine.

In this show they drilled a hole in a so called 'door' in the pyramid to reveal a great discovery.  There's a wall behind the 'door' !

But is it really just a wall ?  It looks like a wall.  But to Hawass it's another great archeological discovery.  There's some dirt in front of the wall which to Hawass is an indication of another great discovery waiting behind this wall.

These people should stop damaging the pyramid more than it already has been and start restoring it to its original form.

The Great Pyramid contains shafts and other mysterious chambers which only make sense when the pyramid is viewed as a machine.

There's no evidence whatsoever that anyone was ever buried in the Great Pyramid or that it was even intended to be used to bury someone.

Does it make sense that people would build something like this just to bury someone ?

1808699,4,B00007G200,"I have been studing Ancient Egypt for many many years .  I got addicted and could never stop, but I had many questions about the Pyramids.  This DVD answered them all and i enjoy watching it over and over again! If you are as passionate about Egypt as me or Zahi Al-Hawass then this is a must have! The only flaw was an american personality doing the report on the sarcopogus! He was pushy and whine.",1062720000,5,400,4.25

7976020,2,B00007G200,"This is one of the worst docs I've seen based on production value. Pretending that everything was happening live, like on the news, is ridiculous. I watch docs to learn something. The hosts are absurd.  The actual archeologists seems put out every time they had to answer questions. I was more interested in the city they found than this fake door. I expect more from natgeo.

Not to mention the male host pronounced tuts name wrong to one of the most famous Egyptologists in the world. Embarrassing.",1380326400,,500,4.735632183908046

7976022,4,B00007G200,"It's interesting even though the news value is years out of date (made in 2002). Since National Geographic sponsored this particular dig, they got to film what was going on as it happened. That gives the viewer an insight into archeology unavailable any other way. A 4,500 year old sarcophagus was found, and opened on camera. A robot was built to explore a narrow shaft in the ""Queen's Chamber"" (the queen was never in there, but that's what it's traditionally called), and we watch the camera on the robot. And when the end of the shaft is reached and it is sealed by a stone, the testing and the decision to drill a hole in the stone is done on camera, as well. A major feature of the entire video is the Egyptian head of archeology: the guy responsible for such decisions as drilling that hole and opening that sarcophagus.

Another element of the story is the excavation of an entire city at the base of the pyramid that housed the workers and their families, and demonstrated that they were not slaves, but well-fed, well treated workers. There are bones that show a healed break which was set properly, and even an amputation that the patient survived for many years. As the researcher pointed out, such care was taken with highly skilled workmen, not slaves. Also, it became apparent that the workers were divided up into teams, and there was apparently a good bit of competition between the teams, which is sound psychology with free workers, but not with slaves.

This movie not only takes us inside the Great Pyramid, which is fascinating enough by itself, but also into the workings of archeologists and their various specialties in considerable detail. I found it quite interesting, but I admit to being a little disappointed that there were no gem-encrusted gold artifacts.",1336867200,,1787,4.7612903225806456
7976023,5,B00007G200,"If you're interested in what is being done in terms of Modern Egyptian Archaeology, this is the dvd for you!  It goes out of its way to be ""dramatic,"" but really, it's just a good story of some of the things modern Egyptian archaelogy is interested in finding out- For example, there seems to be convincing proof that the people who built the pyramids were not slaves, but modern work gangs who were taken care of very well.  There seems to be good evidence that these gangs were taken care of when they were hurt plus were fed well.  If things like this interest you, then by all means, get this dvd!  The stuff on the great pyramid is meant to draw you in, but really, this is more of a dvd to show how the pyramids might have been built and by whom.",1260835200,3,752,4.201388888888889
7976024,5,B00007G200,"National Geographic Video - Into the Great Pyramid
Very informative and I am looking forward to my upcoming visit next week to Egypt to ""follow the trail"" of the narrater. Typical of National Geographic productions always informative and puts you there right on the spot to see and feel the way it is.",1222819200,,301,4.69811320754717
7976025,4,B00007G200,"This DVD is up to National Geographic's ususal high production standards except in a couple of instances where the videography is a little sloppy. The program is a good introduction to the Great Pyramid, not only including the pyramid itself but the adjoining worker's cemetery and village.  Short segments on earlier pyramids help with the context.  The heart of the program is being with scientists at the time they open the sarcophogus in the overseer's tomb and penetrate beyond the door in the small passage from the queen's chamber in the Great Pyramid for the first time.  The graphics and reenactments add to the program's understanding.  The bonus features are good summaries of their respective topics.",1176768000,2,712,5.112068965517241

Nope, stayed up till two in the morning so they could discover another door.  No joke.

There was other things inbetween the live shots of the mechanical thing going through the tiny tunnel to the next door, but it was late and I don't remember most of it.  Sorry!",1103414400,6,496,4.417582417582418
