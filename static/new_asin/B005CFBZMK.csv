8465375,3,B005CFBZMK,"This was suppose to have 12 different movies,  mine had 8 + 2 of the same on another disc. 7 of the movies that were there I had seen on tv so they were ok. But they put the wrong movie Piranha movie on it. The human poacher was named Piranha. The piranha fish was in one place, that's it. Was it worth it, no I paid for 12 movies, I got 7 that was shown on the front cover.",1376092800,,374,3.675
8465376,4,B005CFBZMK,"This movie pack was a way to survive a 1 week power outage, i watched 2 movies a day on my computer, and frequently charged my computer at a friends house. The movies inside is another story, some of them were pretty good, such as 30,000 Leagues Under The Sea, (although nothing like the book.) Some of the movies were so bad I laughed for hours, for example in Mega Piranha, they used Nerf Guns and painted them black as replacement for prop guns. One last thing is that the special effects were horrible (in some of the movies.) but overall this is worth it if you are bored and have a day or two of your life to waste.",1320019200,4,621,4.183333333333334
