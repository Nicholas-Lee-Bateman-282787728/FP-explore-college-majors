1103602,5,630601232X,"If this film can be summed up into one word, it's ""Edutainment"".  Believe it or not, this film is not only immensely entertaining, but it is educational as well.  All our lives we've seen images of pimps in TV shows and movies, dressed up in their purple snakeskin outfits and acting like clowns - but ""American Pimp"" illustrates what real-life pimps are really like.
Ok, so some of the pimps ARE a bunch of guys dressed up in purple outfits acting like clowns, but this documentary shows the side of ""pimpin'"" that you've never seen.  You'll learn about ""the game"" and how pimps get ""knocked"" for not keeping tight reins on their ""hoes.""  You'll also see how their girls work day and night making hundreds, even thousands of dollars, and then handing it all over to their pimps without even getting the slightest share in profits.
Why do the girls do this?  Why to pimps do what they do?  WHAT exactly are pimps?  Well watch ""American Pimp"" and you'll be educated and entertained like never before on the age-old profession of ""pimpin"".
This documentary ranks up there with ""When They Were Kings!""  It's a MUST HAVE for any DVD collection!",971136000,29,1140,4.665
1103603,3,630601232X,"The Hughes Brothers (""Menace II Society"") borrow a page from the Maysles Brothers (""Gimme Shelter"") for this frank look at the life of the American pimp. There's no narrator telling us what to think about these guys--for better or for worse, they speak for themselves. Most are more articulate and intelligent than you might expect, but a few say some pretty disturbing things, like the gentleman who insists that if he didn't beat his women, they wouldn't think he cared (Terrence Howard's D-Jay says something similar in ""Hustle & Flow""). Of course, not one of these men actually uses the word ""women"". They're all [...] and worse, with the exception of the ""legitimate"" pimp (the only Caucasian man in the film) who runs the Moonlight Bunnyranch and refers to his employees as ""girls."" Of the two women interviewed, one uses the word ""ho"" just as often as any of the pimps, so it seems it's just accepted terminology if you're part of ""The Game.""

In any case, this is an entertaining documentary with a bumpin' soundtrack and some well chosen film clips from a variety of blaxploitation classics (""The Mack,"" et al). Because the Hughes never say what they think about these guys, it's hard to know where they stand. I can only imagine they find them as intriguing yet repellent as I do (and a lot more glamorous than I ever could). I've gained no new respect for pimps having seen this film, but I did come away with a better understanding as to why some men choose this line of work and what their lives are like. Suffice to say that by the end of ""American Pimp,"" almost every one of these cats has hustled himself right on out of the Game.

Danny Brown, a pimp from Los Angeles was interviewed and offered this gem of insight, "" Pimping was legal until Black men started profiting from it."" He is most probably correct. There are far more black pimps than white pimps interviewed and on a psychological level this makes perfect sense. White male culture has traditionally and methodically done everything to demonize and emasculate black men. Black men have retaliated by becoming pimps. I don't know if that is the take-away the Hughes Brothers wanted the audience to make.

1103793,3,630601232X,"American Pimp (The Hughes Brothers, 1999)
[originally posted 28Mar2001]

It shouldn't surprise anyone that stereotypes are wrong, and that the truth is always far more complex than many would have us believe. Allen and Albert Hughes, disaffected with the red tape and mechanics of Hollywood after their first two fantastic films (Menace II Society and Dead Presidents), set out to make an independent documentary that shed a little more light on the pimp than the stereotypical evil man in a thousand-dollar suit injecting his stable of whores with heroin every few hours to keep them pliant.

They do a credible job, for the most part. The Hughes Brothers themselves are never part of the film, except for a chuckle here or a sotto voce question there, preferring to let the pimps, and a prostitute here and there, tell the stories themselves. It becomes quickly obvious that both pimps and prostitutes are sharp, interesting characters. They belie some of the stereotypes, while reinforcing others. But most important, they come off as human.

Ultimately, the film runs ten to fifteen minutes too long, but it's well-enough put together that the error is forgivable. A viewing of this might make the average American rethink his views on the sex industry in America today. ***",1390176000,,1278,5.04739336492891

Virtually all of these Pimps in the film, are black. As a black female, I'm especially offended that black males, who have been oppressed in our society, turn around and exploit desperate women. These black pimps in the documentary, are no better than the white males that they rail against because of racism. Yes, racism still exists, and it has been very damaging to blacks, and other minorities. But racism shouldn't be an excuse, for these black Pimps to abuse, and live off of prostitutes. Pimps are a disgrace to the black community, and are horrible role models for black kids.

Many women in society, especially women-of-color, become prostitutes as a way to support a drug-habit, escape poverty, or because they're fleeing terrible home lives. For a Pimp to take advantage of women in these situations, is utterly abominable. These Pimps have no scruples whatsoever, and don't deserve to be glorified in the media.

What I liked: the open honesty of the pimps and the juxtaposition of the 1970s blaxploitation cinema of pimp culture with the reality of it.

But I didn't feel like I was getting complete honesty.  Everything I've read or seen about prostitutes addresses the fear and terror they have of their pimp.  Earn or get beaten.  Earn or get killed.  A friend of mine in Homicide has told me about a case in his city where a pimp took a girl outside of town, raped her and set her on fire, killing her in front of his other girls.  True story.  I read a book about a Christian ministry in the Midwest that included photos of teen prostitutes murdered by their pimps, one with an article of clothing stuffed in her mouth and a wire around her neck.  I don't think I'll ever forget that.

Watching this ""documentary,"" I got the feeling I was watching violent men on their best behavior.  And that is not ""honesty.""

If I watch this doc again (because it is professionally made and well done), I want to count how many times you hear, ""You know what I'm saying?""",1240790400,3,1168,4.381395348837209

It manages to surprise us by revealing that pimps have with their hookers a symbiotic relationship that is both quasi-paternal and quasi-marital. The ""employees"" of the dynamic often seem to not fear their employers who they instead idolize. This conflicts with our default position in regards to workers of the sex trade which is that they are objects of oppression and misfortune. We forget the fact that many of those who chose to sell their bodies do so by choice. As to whether we can label them as being masochistic personalities or not is another matter entirely, yet, even if this was the case, it would not contradict personal choice having something to do with their decision making.

Most of the time,those type of documentaries are filmed from the point of view of the pimp not the prostitutes.
Hence,this documentary from one of my favorite directors,Allen
& Albert Hughes entitled ""American Pimp"".
""American Pimp"" is both fasanating and disturbing. Showcasing years worth of famous pimps. From the well-known Bishop Don Magic Juan(glamourized by rappers such as Ice-T,Snoop Dogg,
Jay-Z,and Ludacris) and Too $hort to lesser knowns such as Charm and Rosebudd.
I found Bishop Don Magic Juan the most intresting pimp because
he seemed proud of his success. He even compares his wealth(courtsey of pimping) as ""The American Dream"".Which is a VERY intresting view. I also found it intresting when his mother and sister were featured and they were proud of his success as well.
Juan-like the other pimps featured-has a strange mix of charm,wit,self-assureness of dubious effects. You know that these men aren't to be exactly idolized yet they're charming and somewhat likeable.
Also noteworthy was the montage of the mainstream media's images of pimps. A lot of which borders on the offensive.
Blaxplotation films such as ""Willie Dynamite"",""Superfly"",and
""The Mack"" glorified pimping. And rap artists have always adopted pimp tatics in their music and/or image to be cool.
Again,this is eyebrow raising stuff.
The Hughes Brothers pulled off this documentary well,I must say.

We are even shown a legitmate pimp, who runs the bunny farm/ranch out in the Nevada desert. The legitmate pimp does not knock the street pimps, he gives them credit for keeping the game strong. To the Hughes Bros. credit, they show the underside of pimping when a New Orleans pimp is arrested for various crimes. The pimp doesn't cower against the system, he simply holds his head high and saves the regrets. Danny Boy, explains the origin of ""macking"" and how the modern era of pimping evolved. He explains how during the reconstruction era, ""post civil-war"" the pimps were undiscovered until they began to compile large sums of money, due to the ""pimping"". Rosebud, explains how Hollywood distorts the image of the pimp, creating a clownish, cowardly figure. Kenny Red puts the game down in D.C. Charm, explains how the track works in Honolulu...These are real dudes, doing some real stuff!!Sex sells and it's a billion dollar bizness....I don't admire pimps, but I think they lead an intruiging life style filled with amusing stories......Curious to know if the Hughes Bros. will stick to documentaries? Or continue to make full length feature films.... Great Job? Only drawback on the DVD is the terrible interview given, where they react extremely immature....",983232000,7,2003,5.018018018018018
1103901,4,630601232X,"Every morn when rosy fingered dawn deflowers the darkness, a coterie of hookers--sore, tired, yet contemplative--awake. The American Pimp is counting his 'benjamins' and the hustle and bustle of the New Economy thrusts itself into Postmodernity. Yet amidst the Wired mags and Imacs, NYstock exchange and NASDAQ, there is a market as old as The Anointed One. And while Henry Ford is the business man of yesteryear and Bill Gates  the precient guru of the e-future, the pimp is the true Every(business)man. His markets thrive on the shoulders of its sacred ancestors: Geisha girls, Ancient Greek lover boys, among other Red Light commodities. Yet, this film is suprisingly terse in coverage of this rich history. Perhaps the ""American"" of ""American Pimp"" is suggestive of these limits.  One should not be so naive as to enshackle the filmmakers with such theoretical constraints that tend to follow the tune of: 'it is simply a movie about pimpin' or 'you are over analyzing it' or 'this is ethically abject.' Ice-T's commentary is ghetto fabulous, yes, we understand this, but it is also ruggedly individual--a distinctly American trait.  And that is what makes this film a distinctly American film.  Hence my glowing reccomendation.",981072000,,1232,5.175879396984925
