It was also chosen to play at the prestigious Swansea Bay Film Festival in Wales, and in Manchester, England as well.

Under the expert recreated makeup of Norman Bryn, Conor pays tribute to the legendary Boris Karloff in two performances: the Frankenstein Monster and the Mummy.

Interspersed throughout the film Conor, along with members of the cast and crew, explain how an idea for the Karloff project progressed into reality.

The audience is drawn into their enthusiasm for the subject, their meticulous research, and the caring way they pieced it all together to create the finished product.

A wonderful tribute to Boris Karloff, by a fine actor and a dedicated staff.

This makes a great introduction to Boris Karloff for a new generation of film enthusiasts unfamiliar with the actor's work.

There are a number of special features on the dvd as well, including Conor's short films of PICKMAN'S MODEL and BOOTH",1231718400,4,1061,5.0285714285714285
