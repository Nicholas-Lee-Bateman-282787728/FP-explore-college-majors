8758708,2,B01EGQQ2L4,"Mason (Cray Thomas) and Allen (Justin Davanzo) are magazine writers and adventurers. Mason was a ""paladin"" in a secret society who hunt siftlings, an alien that can transfer itself from human to human. They are searching for a rune/ruin rod, the only thing that can capture the alien which can not be destroyed even with fire. Meanwhile the alien is out to kill those that know it exists, even though just transferring itself into their body would have been easier.

Most of the film is about two human groups fighting against each other looking for a map to find the rod that apparently has made its way from Europe to the Californian desert. The dialogue was by design corny and the fighting choreography was similar to old movie serials with over hyped sound track. Clearly parts were intentionally a spoof, but the overall film lack entertainment value with the low budget. The actors were not convincing in their roles. The best thing about the films were in inept bad guys. The shifting was low budget and not creepy or interesting. No one whistling ""Time is on My Side.""
