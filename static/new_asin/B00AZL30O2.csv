5530338,2,B00AZL30O2,"Essentially what this movie does is give a very quick and brief over view of some major battles that have taken place over the course of the Afghan war. It does such a poor job of taking you ""inside"" the war and what has been going on over the last decade. For example, it briefly goes over the story of what happened to Marcus Luttrell and his unit during Operation Redwing, but doesn't even mention them by name or the name of the operation. That was a pretty significant event and this movie talked about it for a very brief 2 minutes. They did a very poor job covering Operation Anaconda as well as other very large and important battles that have taken place. Had I not already read and watched so many other good pieces on the war, I wouldn't have learned a whole lot from this just because its so poorly put together. If you really want to learn more about what this war check out the following books etc. Most of these stories and a lot of people/authors were covered in this movie but it doesn't do their stories justice. Read what their stories.

5530339,5,B00AZL30O2,"this is one of the best documentaries i have seen on the war in Afghanistan, no holds barred as near to the enemy as you would want to be, National Geographic are masters at producing edge of your seat truthful and informing programmes, i would recommend this DvD to anybody interested in knowing how the war in Afghanistan has evolved over the last ten years.",1367280000,3,360,4.553846153846154

8559699,3,B00AZL30O2,"Good, but not nearly as good as the Combat Rescue program they have.  Recommended, but the highlights are the interviews with the soldiers.",1396656000,,139,5.043478260869565
8559700,5,B00AZL30O2,Great video!! Exact and accurate information of Afghanistan war. My sons unit was in this video. I have a copy put away for family history. National Geographic used real men that deployed there and did amazing things there especially Michael Peterson.,1393632000,,251,5.146341463414634
8559701,3,B00AZL30O2,"I wanted to like this Nat'l Geographic special on the Afghan War but it was disappointing. The interviews with the soldiers are just awesome and you feel so amazed at their bravery & service. But the video gives the viewer virtually no background information on the history of Afghanistan the country, and how many times it has been invaded by outside forces (the British, the Russians and now the US), all of which have failed. I also wanted to know more about the Taliban and the structure of the tribal society of the country but none of that was really covered in the video. NGH normally does great documentaries, but I would not recommend this DVD to anyone based on what it leaves out--not what it includes which is well done.",1373587200,,732,4.595419847328245
8559702,5,B00AZL30O2,"Watching the news and assuming we know how it is in any war zone just doesn't make it.  ""Inside the Afghanistan War"" puts you along side members of our military on a day by day scenario to fully understand the conditions in which they were challenged with everyday.  History books may report the cause and outcome of a war, but this documentary puts you in a position to fully understand the stress and pressure our military members were in.  I totally recommend this to anyone who appreciates the work of our military and wants to fully understand history in real life terms.",1373587200,,576,4.627450980392157
