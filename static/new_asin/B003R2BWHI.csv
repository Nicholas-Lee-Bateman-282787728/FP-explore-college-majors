4175543,5,B003R2BWHI,"My 3 and 5 year old grandsons love this Busytown DVD.  It has many of the episodes that have only been available on YouTube, not a site I usually want my young ones on.  I searched for these origial episodes for many years in any format (VCR or DVD). This one is a wonderful collection so many of them.  The stories are not only entertaining but they have some good life lessons for young ones. They will be able to view again and again for a long time to come and not get tired of it.",1286150400,14,485,4.03125

8403008,1,B003R2BWHI,The Paramount logo does NOT belong in the opening sequence. They should remove the Paramount logo in the opening sequence. Because in TV shows the production company's logo go in the closing credits not in the opening sequence. And I can wait to write and produce new episodes of Corduroy The Bear at Nelvana.,1480809600,,309,4.7407407407407405

8403013,5,B003R2BWHI,"This is one of those rare cartoons that neither demeans parents nor encourages crude behavior.

This series, in fact, encourages children to obey parents and authorities, respect the rules, and always be nice to others.  You'll find this DVD and the other-larger DVD set-to be well worth the price of purchase.",1299888000,5,310,5.0588235294117645
