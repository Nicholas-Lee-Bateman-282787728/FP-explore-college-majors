259273,3,6300218074,"Released to 1987, Hot Pursuit is a youth misadventure/comedy starring John Cusack as a teen who is unable to go to the Caribbean with his girlfriend (Wendy Gazelle) & her family, but follows shortly thereafter, which leads to a string of misadventures. A youthful Ben Stiller and his dad are on hand as possible shady characters. Shelley Fabares plays the girlfriends mother while Keith David plays an easy-going island dude.

This is a likable teen comedy, but it seems thrown together. For instance, the protagonists run-in with a trio of black islanders comes out of nowhere and leaves just as awkwardly with no tie-in to the main story. Still, if you like the cast and are in the mood for a teen comedy/island adventure its worth checking out.

For anyone who cares, the island sequences were all shot at Ixtapa, Guerrero, on the west coast of Mexico. So its not even close to the Caribbean, but its a passable substitute. The movie runs 93.

259554,5,6300218074,"I have been searching for this movie for a long time.  It is one of the most underrated John Cusack films.  You must see this hilarious, action-packed classic.  I LOVE Robert Loggia (Mac) and John Cusack together!  I had forgotten that Ben Stiller had a small role in it and was pleased that he didn't have any other vomit-worthy gross scenes that ruin so many movies he is in.  Several other famous faces, so I won't spoil the surprise.  Buy the movie and enjoy it for yourself.",1389484800,,479,4.448275862068965

Hot Pursuit is another young-John-Cusack-does-whatever-he-has-to-do-to-get-the-girl movie, but the guy is charismatic enough to make you care....and laugh....this movie has Rastas...kidnappings....bad grades....(did this guy EVER get a B or even a C???)  Not an art film, but a fun romp and it is rated PG-13, so it is safer for your tweens and teens than most of the comedies that come out nowadays. My 2 daughters enjoyed this movie when they were teenagers. In fact, it was a sleep-over go-to that they would introduce to their friends. That's a pretty good recommendation, eh?

He keeps plugging away and uses a lot of personal acting skill to make the movie lively and exciting. Yet we know what is going to happen from the git-go.  I rate this 3 1/2***
but Amazon doesn't have a split schedule. The movie does not match up to the fun and liveliness in classics like ""Private School,"" ""Private Lessons"" or Day Off(Ferris Buehler). Yet it is enjoyable entertainment especially on a summer afternoon or at a party.  The more in the crowd who watch it, the more fun it will be. Yet compared with ""Hollywood Brats""
this is eons ahead.  Enjoy yourself. The price is cheap & the VHS shows
very well.  The case cover says a lot if you look closely at Cusack in the girl's glasses.  She isn't that hot.",1213401600,,827,4.379084967320262

259679,3,6300218074,"Nice little diversion with Cusack playing a prep-school fish out of Carribean paradise water.  When problems at school delay him from joining his girlfriend and her folks on their vacation getaway, he's determined to find any way to catch up with them, even take up with a questionable post-modern pirate of a ship's captain played by Loggia (who delivers the classic line that headlines this review).  The movie attempts to be all it can be, with subplots involving a family of crooks, a kidnapping, and a search for paternal acceptance, but it's mostly held afloat by Cusack and Loggia's repartee.  This is one of Cusack's last pure-breed 80's comedys before he broke out into his dramedy films of the 90's, and his loud ""I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME!"" schtick wears a little thin by the conclusion, but all parties involved were smart enough to keep the film short, so it's not painfully obvious.  An absolute must for all Cusack fans, and decent fun for everyone else.",1018051200,9,983,4.798816568047338

Cusacks demeanor somehow makes it all feel plausible; you know his character finds it just as ridiculous as you do. A blast from start to finish, you cant help but be entertained (unless you're a stickler for realism). I would recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone who loves silliness and a good adventuregreat movie if you like to let your imagination run away. Absolute treasure to find this on Prime Video!",1516233600,,480,4.795180722891566

Interesting to see Father and Son team of Jerry and Ben Stiller in a less than comedy role.
It looks like it was filmed in Mexico.",1509667200,,184,3.972972972972973
