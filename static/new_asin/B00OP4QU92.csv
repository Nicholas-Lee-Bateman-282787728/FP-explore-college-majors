6758290,5,B00OP4QU92,Awesome 30 minute exercise to work the whole body - my go to video!,1422489600,,67,3.857142857142857
6758291,5,B00OP4QU92,I've been looking for a barre workout that really gets your heart rate up and keeps it up.  This one does that just perfect for me.  My average heart rate throughout the workout was 147 and I burned about 280 calories according to my Polar HR Monitor.  I love barre workouts and this is a much better way to get your cardio in than getting on the elliptical or treadmill.,1421366400,5,371,4.271428571428571
6758292,5,B00OP4QU92,"I love barre workouts and was looking for a cardio barre workout on days I work and am short on time! This is cardio and I really like the instructor. If you are new to barre workouts I would start with something else with more instruction on form, such as Exhale Core Fusion, Barre Method, Pure Bar, Callanetics, or Fluidity. The program includes a modified exerciser and an advanced, which I love on dvds.  Cardio Blast moves very quickly and a couple of times to floor to standing, which took me longer to do at my age than the super fit ""kids"" in the video. ( I rewound it.) The wide deep plies I had to modify and the lunges with punching, but the rest I did just fine. This is low impact (one foot on the floor at all times). There is no stretching until the end of the video, but some of the fast moves include stretch contract stretch contract. Also there are some very unique moves that I have never done before. This video got my heart rate up and my butt sore. It was a blast, and went by very quickly. The instructor makes it fun! Also I do Physique 57 full programs which really helped with the quickness of this program.",1420934400,12,1134,4.25
6758293,4,B00OP4QU92,Love this workout! Packs a lot in a 30 min time frame. Just wish the price was a bit lower for a short workout.,1420588800,3,111,3.6666666666666665
6758294,5,B00OP4QU92,Chad Levy is an awesome instructor.  This DVD is intense!  I love anything P57 and this thigh twizzler is a killer!  As is everything else!  Great addition to your Physique collection!,1416441600,6,184,4.838709677419355
8684403,5,B00OP4QU92,"Excellent! This one is a bit more complex than the other Physique 30 minute workouts I have, but just a matter of getting the routine down.  This one is definitely a cardio workout.  I love Physique 57!!!",1488240000,,204,4.486486486486487
8684404,5,B00OP4QU92,Wow!  Excellent workout!  Fast paced and challenging!,1478217600,,53,6.428571428571429
8684405,5,B00OP4QU92,This is a great workout. The instructor was a little annoying at first but he totally grew on me.  I am really enjoying the Physique 57 workouts.,1466985600,,145,4.37037037037037
8684406,5,B00OP4QU92,"This is one of the very best barre DVDs I have when I want to work my whole body in 30 minutes.  I exercise 6-7 days a week, and have roughly 200 exercise DVDs of which over 50 are barre, and this one is definitely a keeper.  Thankfully, unlike what I have had to deal with in many of my other P57 workouts, Chad isn't obnoxious, narcissistic, and incredibly annoying, and there is no mention of cankles, saddlebags, cellulite etc.  He is just instructive, and encouraging, as I prefer.  If I had to make any improvements to this DVD, it would be that it is chaptered, so I can easily repeat a move, skip intro etc, and that I wish he mirror-cued.  None of the P57s I have seen have mirror cueing, which I believe is a disservice to buyers, but I'm sure Chad had to follow the formula.  Still, a great purchase, absolutely no regrets!",1465862400,8,834,4.314102564102564
8684407,4,B00OP4QU92,"This workout was just what I was looking for, it really got my heart rate up while toning muscle. I workout regularly but my legs were shaking by the time I completed this video. They had options for beginners to follow as well as advanced so I alternated between the two depending on the specific move and how long I was able to perform it. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking to strengthen muscle especially in their lower body.",1462665600,,443,4.414634146341464
8684408,5,B00OP4QU92,"I have bought so many dvds to get fit, only to give up in no time,  but this dvd is fantastic, this guy keeps you motivated  throughout,
after day 3 of doing this  my legs ached which showed it was working, I did 15 minutes every day and can see the difference in my legs in 2 weeks.
You won't be disappointed if you  buy this.",1460764800,,327,3.909090909090909
8684409,5,B00OP4QU92,"I love this - he is so likable and doesn't require some of the weird holding the ball on the back of your leg that we have to do in class where I am constantly dropping the ball.  I took this on vacation to melt off all the alcohol and felt de-toxed.  gives me a sweat every time.  I do Chad with Jillian  30 day shred on a feeling like i need to melt day.  Tanya is a bit annoying, but highly recommend her 30 minute advanced if you want to feel the fierce 'near crying' experience of a real class (but be warned, she does that ball move a lot) which I also do with the 20 minute Jillian.  The other 30 minute workouts from physique i haven't enjoyed as much as these two mentioned in terms of intensity.",1447545600,4,705,4.0
8684410,5,B00OP4QU92,"Whew!  This is only a 30 minute workout but you are definitely getting a WORKOUT and it flies by!  The instructor is not overbearing and generally gives good instructions.  I'm sure the second time I do this DVD I'll have no trouble following along.  It is a little pricey, but I feel like I'm getting my money's worth for this quality exercise DVD.  I've tried many Barre exercise classes and DVDs and generally find them too laid back and an inefficient use of my exercise time, but Physique 57's DVDs hit the spot every time!",1442880000,3,528,4.515789473684211
8684411,5,B00OP4QU92,"Love this workout, it goes by quickly and it completely fries your legs.",1432944000,,72,4.615384615384615
8684412,5,B00OP4QU92,"I'll admit,I never really understood all the hype about Physique 57-personally I never enjoyed the workouts,and the 1 Instructor Tanya Becker was just untollerablly annoying. I did enjoy this 1 though and always feel great after! The only thing is that sometimes it is a little hard on my knees,so I can't do it too many times in 1 week. I do pull it out though whenever I want a quick lower body workout,and I especially love the Abs portion. As far as the other Physique 57 workouts,I much prefer Tracy Effinger's Squeeze&Squeeze Stronger dvds-they have some moves very similar to P57 but I much prefer her  personality,and I just find them more enjoyable",1426464000,4,657,4.7631578947368425
