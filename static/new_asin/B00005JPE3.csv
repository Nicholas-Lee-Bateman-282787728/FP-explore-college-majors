1574408,5,B00005JPE3,"MUSIC AND LYRICS: This movie is going straight into my rainy day blues DVD rack. I look forward to watching it again, because I laughed from the opening POP GOES MY HEART 80's-style music video to the end credits, except for the pro forma romantic problem scenes. Grant is in his element, playing a washed up pop singer looking for a hit song. His hip action during performance is hilarious. Barrymore is sweet and lovable as always, a damsel in need of a protector. And Haley Bennett is a wonderful find as Cora, a hipshaking Madonna-Shakira-Britney hybrid with superficial spiritual yearnings. Her blasphemous use of a giant Buddha as her entry into her stage act reminds me of Madonna on the cross, just as offensive and just as narcissistic, but here we see the point. The original music is surprisingly good for a romantic comedy, and I may buy the CD as well as the DVD. Overall, already one of my favorite romantic comedies and one of Hugh Grant's best efforts in years.",1171843200,4,977,4.6531791907514455
1574409,5,B00005JPE3,"M&L is driven by several major sources of energy, if you will, mixed
together with skill and a fine sense of timing: absurd comedy, parody,
utter predictability and an overwhelming charm that only a
romantic-comedy hater could resist. As for me, I was...well 'charmed'.
Hugh Grant, as my wife noted, basically always plays the same
character: a mix of hapless but amusing bumbler with a self-effacing
sense of insight into his own bumbler-ness and maybe human nature in
general. In anybody else this endearingness would be annoying--and do
not doubt that there are a lot of Hugh-Grant-haters out there; and good
for you, because I know where you're coming from. It's just that I'm
not with you on this.

Drew Barrymore has always had a slight inherent cluelessness and
innocence, mixed it with a twinkle of the actress's own
life-ups-and-downs, that made her perfect for this little flick. This
is in contrast to another not-so-recent movie Ever After, which was
very likable and charming, but I wished the Cinderella character had
been someone else, because the US accent just grated--just as did, for
example, the accents in The Three Musketeers and especially Chris
O'Donnell's D'Artagnan. I can't abide that kind of sloppiness. But
here, Barrymore was perfect.

They spent a lot of time on music numbers in this one, playing songs
almost all the way through. This normally would have annoyed me for I
would have thought of it as the time-filler it might have been. If it
was, well in this instance I don't care, because it worked as well. And
the ditty Way Back Into Love is a real earworm. It made the whole thing
almost believable--believable enough at the time to allow, for me at
least, effortless suspension of disbelief.

Last, but not least, this is the kind of movie I could never make or
script. I don't have the disposition for it. Because of that I really
have no notion of how to make it better--and that's a good thing,
because I wasn't sitting there, asking myself ""but why didn't they..."",
which is what I sometimes do in flicks that I might have written, but
in which I detect serious flaws. If this thing here had flaws, well, I
don't care. It was fun and games and lots of laughs. And yes, call me
whatever you want to, but I was humming that damn tune when I came out.

1574410,4,B00005JPE3,"There's something fascinating about songwriting; it requires the perfect blending of melody and language in order to be effective. ""Music and Lyrics"" is a romantic comedy about songwriting, which I suppose was an inevitable combination considering how common love songs are. I have to admit that I liked this movie, but for the life of me, I really don't understand why; the romantic aspect of the story was incredibly predictable, following a formula that's been used many times in many other romantic comedies. It's simple: boy meets girl, boy almost loses girl, boy gets girl back. If that structure doesn't sound even remotely familiar, then you must not be paying attention.

Still, it's a charming film, and I can't begrudge a romantic comedy for working exactly the way a romantic comedy is supposed to work. Likewise, I can't begrudge Hugh Grant for playing the exact same character again. This kind of film is supposed to have an overly sarcastic yet attractive leading man; that's what makes his character so appealing. He plays Alex Fletcher, a washed up singer desperate to revive his career. He was once part of Pop, a successful 1980s band. Now he's reduced to making embarrassing appearances at high school reunions and amusement parks. He narrowly avoids disaster by refusing a guest appearance on ""Battle of the `80s Has Beens,"" a reality TV show in which formerly famous singers duke it out in a boxing match.

Then he meets Cora (Haley Bennett), a sultry music phenomenon influenced by New Age and Far East philosophy (during her concert--I kid you not--she emerges from a gigantic Buddha statue). Apparently, she's a big fan of Alex's, and for that reason alone she wants him to write her a song. Of course, there are a couple of guidelines: 1) it absolutely has to be titled ""Way Back into Love""; 2) it has to be written and delivered by the end of the week. The sudden pressure on Alex isn't helped by the fact that his scheduled appearances at Knott's Berry Farm and other amusements parks have been cancelled. What's worse, he has no skill in lyric writing. If he wants to deliver a song to Cora, he has to find a lyricist fast.

His first attempt with a lyricist founders almost as soon as it begins. Then he meets Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), a tightly wound, neurotic young woman assigned to water Alex's plants (don't ask how such an idea came about; I'm still trying to understand it). As Alex plays a small piece of the melody on the piano, lo and behold, Sophie mumbles an impressive line of lyrics. Thus begins the Boy Meets Girl portion of the story, something that quickly becomes a fast paced journey into the songwriting process. As the song develops, so does their relationship. And as you might expect, the two eventually fall in love.

Does this not sound like the basic story of a thousand other romantic comedies? And let's not forget the emotional roller coaster that must be ridden; many of the ensuing issues are directly related to Sophie, who hasn't gotten rid of some emotional baggage. She once had an affair with her English teacher, one that ended with the discovery of his wife and with Sophie being characterized in his new novel. Ever since then, she's been unable to write without feeling incredibly sorry for herself. And then there's the matter of ""Way Back into Love,"" which Cora absolutely loves. Her ideas on how to alter the song are not good; she turns it into a pulsating Tantric mess. And now we come to the Boy Loses Girl portion of the story, which in this case retains a fair amount of humor.

I don't suppose I should bother with describing the Boy Gets Girl Back portion; that would give away too much. Let's just say that everything goes the way it's supposed to go. Does this make ""Music and Lyrics"" a bad film? Not at all: actually, it's quite loveable despite being so formulaic. Part of this has to do with the supporting characters of Rhonda Fisher (Kristen Johnston) and Chris Riley (Brad Garrett): Rhonda is Sophie's older sister, and she's been in love with Alex Fletcher and Pop ever since they first hit the music scene; Chris is Alex's manager, and he understands that offers for his client are slim. Both characters add an even greater amount of humor, especially since their lives revolve around Alex (be it directly or indirectly). Example: when Rhonda meets Alex, she asks him for his autograph and for a quick picture. ""Only if you're single,"" he jokingly says. ""I've been married for sixteen years,"" she replies, ""but nothing is written in stone, right?""

Yes, it's a light-hearted joke, but this is a light-hearted film. If you enjoy such material, and if you absolutely love romance stories about two opposite personalities, I guarantee you that you will love ""Music and Lyrics."" However, you will be able to see the ending coming a mile away. Funny that that didn't bother me; I usually look for originality in a good movie. In my review for ""The Messengers,"" I said, ""It can't be a good sign when you can predict the ending only ten minutes into the film."" It seems that I was wrong; films like ""Music and Lyrics"" prove that sometimes, we actively seek something formulaic.",1171497600,6,5166,4.740823136818688
1574411,5,B00005JPE3,"Sure. Why not? The first question in assessing a movie's merit is does it do as intended?

With ""Music and Lyrics,"" what it intends is nothing extraordinary. It aims to be a fun, romantic, sweet comedy of a man meeting a woman and falling in love, with a poke at pop culture. It accomplishes this. I saw this on February 14, Valentine's Day, and wanted exactly as delivered.

Paul McCartney asked in the 1970s what the world needs with another silly love song. ""Music and Lyrics"" is, in film, a silly love song.

Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, a has-been pop singer from a defunct duo similar to Wham!, struggles to find his way as his audience stops caring. Realistic, he knows what he is capable of, but is unsure what his next step should be.

When Cora, a pretentious form of Britney Spears-Shakira-Christina Aguilera of sex-pop, offers him an opportunity to write a song, he runs into trouble. He is a melody man, not a lyricist. His lyricist from his old band, Pop!, is long gone.

In walks Sophie Fisher, played with charm by the ever-sweet Drew Barrymore. She's Alex's temporary plant watering person (and not a very good one), with a penchant for delivering peppy lyrics under her breath. Despite the scorn of fill-in wordsmith Greg Antonsky, Alex takes a liking to her style. Greg's angst-style, hopeless lyrics seem off kilter with Alex's personality.

Embittered from a broken affair with an engaged man, Sophie is uninterested. It is one thing to hum a tune, and it is another to commit to writing a song. However, Alex only has a few days and pressures (begs, really), Sophie to help.

She acquiesces, and tries to write. Alex and Sophie clash, as he understands the profession of music, and is desperate, and she is still stuck on the failed affair.

Both are living in the past, and both need to move up into 2007 to survive and thrive.

Finally, lyrics are written, and Cora loves them -- with a few changes. Cora's version is laced with faux spirituality and tramped-up seduction. Sophie's artistic sensibilities are insulted, and pulls the song much to Alex's chagrin. They argue, break-up, and now, Alex is stuck trying to fix a song.

Can he fix the song on time? Will they figure out how to live in the present day? What about love (this is a romantic comedy, remember?).

A fine self-mocking performance is put on by Kristen Johnston as Sophie's older sister Rhonda, making jabs at her own weight-loss campaign. Brad Garrett as Alex's agent Chris Riley is right on the money, as he is both a manager and friend.

Drew Barrymore shows she's more than the girl next door, but has a kind of Lucille Ball, Jenna Elfman, Meg Ryan mix going on.

Hugh Grant is perfectly cast, and is the better side of himself. He never overplays the role, and yet, does not fall into the 'stupid Englishman' persona he occasionally does.

I fully recommend ""Music and Lyrics.""

1574412,5,B00005JPE3,"A date movie released on Valentine's Day has a lot to live up to. Despite the romantically uninspired title, MUSIC AND LYRICS luckily proves to be a very good date movie. After having now seen Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore together, I'll be clamoring for future cinematic team-ups by these two. Both actors play to their own strengths as well as effectively sparking a romantic chemistry. Hugh Grant is his usual wrily charming British person and once again fruitfully mines his wealth of self-deprecating humor, and Drew Barrymore is her normal sweetly engaging, klutzy goofball self. Surprisingly, Drew's adorable goofiness and Hugh's gently acerbic wit work well together. I fully expect MUSIC AND LYRICS to have a theater life long past Valentine's Day.

Now, the plot: Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) was the second banana in the popular 1980's band PoP! (comparisons to Wham! are inevitable). When the band disbanded, front man Colin (now Sir Colin) Thompson easily segued into a successful solo act, his first album comfortably selling 8 million copies. He even had his own cologne called A Whiff of Colin. Meanwhile, Alex's career plummeted as his dismal attempt at his own album (""Rhyme & No Reason"") rapidly landed him in the Super Sale category of the music store. Alex was then reduced to ekeing out a livelihood by going on a back-alley circuit tour, performing at Knotts Berry Farm, Busch Gardens, the Hilton Hotel...Fifteen years later, nothing's changed except that his goal now is to get a musical gig at Disneyland and that, now, he's fielding offers of participating in a boxing reality show called Battle of the '80s Has-Beens (""That Debbie Gibson can take a punch, huh?""). All in all, he's settled into a somewhat graceful acceptance that his better days are now viewed in the rearview mirror.

But Alex's luck seems to change for the better when sexy pop megastar Cora Corman (Haley Bennett, who effectively channels Britney, Christina, and even Shakira) offers him a songwriting gig, providing he could craft one within the next few days. The cherry on top is that if Cora likes the song, Alex'll perform it with her live in a Madison Square Garden concert. If his song sucks, well, there are offerings by eight other has-beens from which she could pick. The dilemma here is that writing song lyrics has never been Alex's cup of tea, having once rhymed ""you and me"" with ""autopsy.""

Then into his life steps Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), his temporary waterer of plants. Sophie, upon their initial meeting, proves to be decidedly quirky. His manager Chris (Brad Garrett) advises Alex to not give her a key. But it doesn't take long for Alex to realize that Sophie actually has a talent for songwriting, and he doesn't waste time in trying to convince her to work with him on Cora's song (he describes her as ""Cole Porter in panties""). She's at first resistant but, of course, is soon convinced. Despite her personal baggages and his non-talent for lyrics and stuck-in-a-rut sensibilities, they look to be a promising writing team. But then they fall in love...

Sometimes you wonder why certain pairings work and others don't. Hugh Grant with Sandra Bullock in TWO WEEKS' NOTICE was a disaster. My take on that is that Sandra Bullock seemed to try too hard (plus, it's never very romantic to give the female lead a case of constipation on the freeway, or anywhere else, for that matter). Drew Barrymore, on the other hand, has a very natural style. In her films, she hardly ever looks contrived. Her rapport with Hugh Grant looks effortless. The playful give and take between the two are worth the price of admission. Another factor in the fun is Grant's musical numbers, complete with hip thrusts and other sundry undulations. He does his own singing, as well, and, while he's not about to knock anyone's socks off with his vocal talents, he doesn't exactly suck. In fact, his heartfelt performance of ""Don't Write Me Off"" almost brought a lump to my throat, before I remembered I was a guy and should act like one. But, well done to Hugh, who I felt mustered every ounce of effort and sincerity into his singing. Vastly enjoyable also is the film's hilarious opening video clip of PoP!'s signature hit song ""Pop! Goes My Heart,"" which perfectly captures the standard 1980s music video. ""Meaningless Kiss"" is very reminiscent of George Michael's tune ""Careless Whispers,"" a song of George's that I quite liked. Even ""Way Back Into Love,"" the song title Alex was hired to write lyrics around, never got old, even with its endless callbacks. As a sidenote, I prefer his duet with Drew much more than his with Haley Bennett (Cora).

The supporting cast is very good. Sophie's older sister Rhonda (Kristen Johnston) makes the most of her role as the still Alex Fletcher-smitten baby boomer. Just about every scene with her is a highlight. Campbell Scott as the dastardly Sloan Cates has a brief appearance but is cold-heartedly effective in that tiny nugget of time. Young pop diva Cora Corman, seeking Eastern enlightenment seemingly thru the path of righteous booty shaking, is played by Haley Bennett with an airheaded yet sensual flair. Brad Garrett, unfortunately, is wasted here as he's stuck playing the straight man role. In real life, he's way funnier than that.

I have no qualms giving five stars to this film, having had such a devastatingly good time watching it. While MUSIC AND LYRICS doesn't have groundbreaking material, it does what it sets out to do, which is to be a sweet and uncomplicated romantic comedy. If you're in the mood for something light and consistently amusing, with two leads who'll reward you with their easy charm and charisma, and if you get a kick out of retro songs and scenes of Hugh Grant gyrating in tight pants, then this one just might be for you.",1171497600,13,5809,4.856710393541877

1574786,4,B00005JPE3,"As a guy when I think about (if I think about) romantic comedies, a few which Ive found that I like, I tend to think of them usually firstly by the female leads. But ones with Hugh Grant are different for me. I think of him first probably because I connect with his faltering, sad sack manners and foibled personality. Im not ashamed to say it. That being said I think that Grant and Drew Barrymore, with her off-kilter cute smile, make an odd pairing but they pull it off here. Its not that they have great chemistry together, because they really don't within their June-September romance, but their affable feelings for each other grow naturally out of their circumstances. Its warm, not hot. Its a growing interest in the other, not a white hot night of passion thats all animal attraction. As Barrymores character, Sophie, puts it (Im summarizing here): its like music and lyrics where the music is the physical attraction but the lyrics are the depth and details of the relationship. This movie is about the lyrics, though its certainly not a deep movie. It also doesnt hurt that it has an 80s sensibility as those were my teen years and years of first romance. But I digress. If you are wondering what the plot is? In a nutshell its about an old 1980s pop star (Alex Fletcher, played by Grant) who is getting by on small nostalgia gigs that are starting to dry up when he gets a chance to be momentarily relevant again by penning a new song for a currently massive artist (think Britney Spears or any other huge bubblegum pop diva), only he cant write lyrics. Along comes the watering plant lady (Sophie Fisher, played by Barrymore) who has a gift for turning a phrase but doubts herself. Together they write the song that the pop diva wants but she also transforms their vision into something they don't like. Will they sell out? Will they stand up for their creative vision? Will they fall cute in love? And will they keep making hits? You already know the answers, but just like a song you like and can listen to again and again youll fall easy for Music and Lyrics.",1488067200,,2075,4.5212765957446805

Hugh Grant plays the star this time around, and Drew Barrymore plays someone from the general public who becomes his love interest. But that's mainly at the end as they are actually working together to create lyrics for a song that may spell his career comeback. I find this film an interesting example of a role reversal for him; it's a film he made not too long after the hit Notting Hill.

Extensively.

And so when Drew Barrymore turns around with tears in her eyes at the sweet, funny, highly personalized song Hugh Grant sings to her at the end, you'd be forgiven if you thought that it was just as good as the time turned around with tears in her eyes at the sweet, funny, highly personalized song Adam Sandler sang to her in 'The Wedding Singer'.

The concept of using the band ""WHAM"" (George Michael/Andrew Ridgely) as the inspiration for the fictional band ""POP"" in this tale of ""what ever happened to that other guy in the band"" was pure genius by the writers, and provides a hysterical backdrop for this romantic comedy (which is by no means just a ""chick flick"" btw). Hugh Grant is his usual dry, self deprecating self in this flic, and Drew Barrymore is pretty my perfect in the role of scattered goofball, plant watering, reluctant songwriting partner. The entire movie is solidly cast, with no clunker roles to be seen. And the casting of relative unknown Haley Bennett, in the major role of Cora - the vapid teen superstar-pop diva (a la Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Miley Cyrus, et al), was absolute brilliance. This movie makes no claim to deep social commentary, finding a cure for cancer, or achieving world peace. It is simply pure, unpretentious fun - with a clever premise that pokes fun at pop culture, but doesn't take itself too seriously. And in that context, is a well made, well acted, and exceptionally entertaining film!",1467676800,,1132,4.835051546391752

1575355,5,B00005JPE3,"Alright, I've seen much better movies with the similar plot of a washed up old timer musician having his/her second shot at a music career and at life. BUT, this movie stands out from that because of three reasons:
1. It has a great soundtrack. Not many movies today accurately depict the culture from the 1980s and the music on this film is good enough to get you hooked.
2. Acting chemistry is brilliant between Grant and Barrymore. I honestly can't expect more because both actors and the cast just plays out their roles beautifully. The script is also brilliant with timely humor. Plus, I get that this film is one of those romantic comedies but I believe that the characters in this film are so layered and the actors are great in showing how they are all looking for something to ease their pain.
3. Personally, you will relate to this film especially if you're a musician or composer. The scenes of this pair composing music and the theme of getting back on your feet even when everyone has given up on you is what has driven me to love this film as one of my favorites. This film teaches you not to judge someone by their cover.

1575701,2,B00005JPE3,"The fake music video at the start of Music and Lyrics proves better than the film itself.  That tells you all you need about the film, starring Hugh Grant as a washed-up former front man of POP!, an '80s knock-off of WHAM!  Grant plays the Andrew Ridgely half of the one-hit wonder, who has scraped by for years pleasing aging fans at fairs, on cruises, and increasing at senior centers.  Given an opportunity when a young star (inexplicably a devoted fan) asks him to write her a new hit, Grant is paralyzed by lyricist's writer's bock until Drew Barrymore arrives to tend his houseplants.  Barrymore has her own baggage -- she's a raging hypochondriac -- but the two have a certain chemistry and a knack for pulling lyrics out of nothing.

Exceedingly predictable from start to ""triumphant"" finish, the movie's a bore.  The faux-MTV video of Pop Goes My Heart (and the MTV ""Pop-Up Video"" of the same song) that begin and end the film are infinitely better than what's in-between, expertly skewering the wretched earworms that passed for music of the era.  Watch the fake video right at the start and then skip to ""Begin Again."" which is infinitely more interesting, better-written and particularly -acted by Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley.",1458345600,,1243,4.834905660377358

This isn't just a generic chick flick.  I can't stand those.  Really loved the constant rapid jokes Hugh Grant delivers so well, and the sweetness and intelligence in Drew Barrymore's character.  The pop star icon, known in the movie as Cora, is truly well done by somebody I would consider a previously unknown actress.  The songs are simple but very dear, catchy and fit the film's overall logic very well.  This is a clean-enough film that I can watch with my teen as well and now there are questions about why there seems to be no CD available of the songs.  They really are fun, retro songs, and the videos of the pseudo-retro songs are hilariously typical of the 1980's, etc.  I'd love to hear them once in a while.",1456704000,,882,4.525316455696203

Maybe you (the guy) will choose this as a nice, harmless ""date movie"" for your woman some night, but you might find your eyes glistening with a tear near the end, so keep the lights down low if that's not your thing. But I suspect your woman will be squeezing you so tight at the finale that you will be more worried about breathing than crying.
Both Barrymore and Grant carry their roles off to perfection. It was surprising to see that Grant actually can play and sing. That raises him up a notch beyond his role as the eternally!! self-deprecating bumbling Brit.
And, of course, the finale with its ""little twist"" -- absolutely ""signed, sealed, and delivered"" the movie.",1437091200,,749,4.639097744360902

1576534,5,B00005JPE3,"A completely charming movie that does a gentle job of sending up popular music not only in the Eighties, but also on today's music scene. The Pop! Video steals the show. I will sometimes put the movie on just to watch this video. My one regret is that in the special featuress there isn't more on the making of the video. Hugh Grant (and Drew Barrymore on the demo they make) turn out to have singing voices as pleasing and agreeable as their onscreen personas and chemistry. A very rewatchable movie. Despite the good job Barrymore and Grant do, I have to say I think the guy who plays Grant's former partner ""Colin"" steals the screen in the video. His dancing is so tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top Eighties boy toy that it's hilarious.

The first time through I kept saying to myself ""this is so sweet!"" The second time through I caught lots of very witty throwaway lines in the dialog and realized that they carefully avoided making the female lead look sexy - that was reserved for a secondary character who was portrayed as shallow.",1430006400,,625,4.743119266055046

1577444,5,B00005JPE3,"One of the best.  Not well reviewed or seen, but watching this always makes me smile.  The main song is catchy ( I am a music teacher) and although the plot is trite, (as is the dialogue), there are some really warming parts that make it worthwhile.  The subplot with Drew Barrymore (and her being the subject of a scathing book by an ex lover) is not great, but the singing and hip gyrating of Hugh Grant always makes me laugh.  The 80's references are (again) hysterical.",1408406400,,473,4.402298850574713

1577607,3,B00005JPE3,This movie was pretty good. Something different for Hugh Grant. Didn't like the singer [that they wrote the song for] nor the Buddist statue and reference. Would have enjoyed it better without all of that.,1401408000,,205,4.885714285714286
1577608,1,B00005JPE3,The writing was predictable and there weren't any real plot twists or shocks or anything. It was pretty standard. The couple didn't have much chemistry either. I felt awkward for them having to pretend to fall in love.,1401321600,,218,4.7631578947368425

1577611,4,B00005JPE3,Good chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant. He's a past his prime pop star and she's a kooky plant girl who come together to write a song for a Shakira like pop goddess.  Lots of witty one liners.  A real feel good movie.  Along the way  a story of personal growth develops for both the main characters so it's more than just silly fun.  The only downside is that I can't get the song out of my head - I've been humming it for days!,1400889600,,442,4.093023255813954

1577688,5,B00005JPE3,"Watch, Laugh, Dance, and Hit Replay: If you like romantic comedies and enjoyed The Wedding Singer for its retro fun and soundtrack, you'll LOVE this.  You don't have to be a Drew Barrymore or Hugh Grant fan to appreciate the fact that they sang their own songs--and well! The plot wasn't a typical boy loses girl because of slapstick shenanigans or a misunderstanding.  They actually disagree about altruistic goals for pursuing a passion.  I was really impressed that Grant learned to dance and play the piano for this movie.  Who cares if he plays the nice guy--and not the cad from Bridget Jones--Grant may have parodied the 80s musical hearththrob of Wham/Duran Duran too well ;)  It's the perfect combo of romantic comedy and musical. Hit replay to count how many references to pop star shenanigans!",1398988800,,804,4.882352941176471
1577689,4,B00005JPE3,"Music and Lyrics - When you see that the cast is led by Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant, you don't expect high art, you expect to be charmed by the leads despite their limited range.  That is exactly what you get in this film.  Their is no uproarious laughter, but there are smiles  and the characters are likeable (if predictable).  The scripts' writers do not throw any surprises at their audience, but even though you knew exactly what would happen at the end by the time you were 10 minutes into the movie, it was done with a pleasant style.  There is a bonus if you are nostalgic about the start of MTV, as the opening of the movie is a music video (of Hugh Grant's character's band) done in the style of every CHEESY early 80's music video.  (It had me smiling and groaning at the same time.)  A pleasant movie for watching with your wife or girlfriend and you'll get a few chuckles (along with the grimaces).",1398902400,,913,4.366863905325443

1577691,4,B00005JPE3,This movie made me sing along and laugh out loud.  I ignored the sceens with the young dancer because there wasn't much point to them but the interaction between the main characters and a few of the supporting ones was a good way to spend an hour or two.  I also enjoyed learning about behind the scenes prep and how Hugh Grant spent quite a bit of time gaining skills for the role and how the recordings of the songs were made.,1398384000,,428,4.2073170731707314

1577773,5,B00005JPE3,"Both Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore do first class jobs in this movie along with a great supporting cast; it is filled with funny lines and humor. Although I am not a fan of pop music, I found this movie to be captivating from beginning to end. Both Grant and Barrymore create characters on the screen that are touching and warm and for whom it is easy to care.

Alex Fletcher, played by Grant, a has-been pop star, has a chance to write a song for Cora Corman, played by Haley Bennett, a highly successful and very popular young pop star that may jump-start has waning career but he has a big problem with the lyrics. As fate would have it, help, in the form of a young woman, Sophie Fisher, played by Drew Barrymore, who is filling in as a plant care substitute, appears to have the talent for words that is needed to help solve Alex's problem.

There is, however, a mysterious problem which is hanging over Sophie which will need to be resolved if she is to help Alex out of his dilemma. The movie tells the story of how this all plays out with charm and wit. It is rated PG-13 for some sexual content.",1396915200,,1104,4.277511961722488
1577774,5,B00005JPE3,Way underrated film. It is both well acted and well sung too. The parodies are truly great if the 1980's band thing. Some of the made for the film songs better than much out today. Buy it!,1396051200,,188,4.108108108108108

1577782,5,B00005JPE3,I love this movie. It is one where you have to listen to the dialogue and innuendo to get the humor. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are perfect in these roles. Funny and sweet love story with out all the profane vulgarity of most movies.,1394841600,,236,4.266666666666667

Their musical collaboration eventually crosses over to each other lives giving a journey to their intimate places and a sensation of pop royalty. With funny puns delivered by Hugh Grant and the playoffs by Drew Barrymore, this is a matchmaker's dream of a comedic duo.

Watching Hugh Grant dance the 80's dance moves makes me chuckle every time I see it. The shout outs to 80's pop stars and VH1's Pop-Up Video are funny. The music is well done and catchy.

What keeps this from getting 5 stars? Drew Barrymore's character is a bit too flaky for my taste.

1578193,5,B00005JPE3,"Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore have each starred in many excellent romantic comedies, and they're both in top form in this movie. There's scarcely a false note; he's legitimately charming, she visibly inspires him, when the relationship falters, you can't help but root for them to get together. The jokes are consistently funny and play to the strengths of the cast, especially Hugh Grant's offhand delivery.

The plot involves the world of popular music of the 1980s and mid-200s, and would surely have failed if the music or the dancing were unpleasant or unrealistic, but the producers nailed this; the songs and videos are perfect.

I admire that the movie has essentially no antagonists -- excepting Barrymore's ex, who appears only briefly, the challenge here is for these two to overcome their own pasts, not some outside actor bent on keeping them apart.",1384387200,,862,5.020979020979021

Hugh Grant had to learn the piano for the role as a washed up pop star and composer who lands a gig writing a song for huge pop star Cora Corman and enlists his substitute plant sitter, played by Barrymore, to come up with the lyrics. It's a hilarious look at '80s pop. A favorite line is when Grant (as Alex Fletcher) tells his manager: ""I'm finished. I'm going to end up doing bar mitzvahs."" And his manager replies: ""No you're not, Thirteen-year-old kids have no idea who you are.""",1384387200,,589,4.566037735849057

I especially liked the mock up music video shown at the beginning of the film.  That was great.  I half expected James Wilby to be the doctor in the video.  This film is a quick watch.

I don't know why, exactly, because both Hugh Grand and Drew Barrymore are absolutely charming and talented actors!  This movie has just enough plot tension to keep you interested plus the charisma of the actors to draw you in.  Hugh Grant is Alex Fletcher, a has-been pop singer/songwriter who is trying to revive his songwriting career but needs to find the right lyricist.  He finds her in Drew Barrymore...the woman who comes in once a week to water his plants!  I know!  I know!  It sounds silly, but if you were after documentary material you wouldn't be looking here!

This is a fun romantic comedy with good re-watch value. I was a bit surprised to see Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore together, but the chemistry works. The ending is a little far-fetched, but aside from that we love it. As products' of the 80's we laughed at the poke at ""modern"" music.

It's very difficult to find clean romantic comedies. This is one of them. Very little profanity, sex, or violence. There is a love scene, but it is very fast and shows almost nothing.",1378339200,,497,4.561797752808989

When I experienced the film last night, I was blown away by how much was in it for me personally.  Which was having to do with one's creativity, dealing with the negativity experiences in our lives, and gently reviewing things/experiences of the eras in our past.
Don't get me wrong, this film is great fun and lots of laugh-out-loud moments.  As a friend commented, after the viewing, to my question, ""How did you like it?""  ""It was good.  The two of them carried the film.""  I realized that was true.....which was perfect for this script and theme....for it is basically a love story and about our personal integrity.

1578432,5,B00005JPE3,"Sort of a ""Wedding Singer"" without the gross old people.

Actually, I don't really like either of these actors, but saw a trailer for this movie on an old DVD, loved the price, & bought it. It was very charming.

For once, Drew Barrymore is actually playing a character her own age. Yeah, she's quirky and odd, but it works. Hugh Grant is an aging has-been singer, with a quick wit and deprecating demeanor.

It perfectly captures the bizarre 1980's music video culture, both parodying & celebrating it at the same time.

Well written, fun with a wonderful score, sometimes silly, other times lovely.

I never heard of this movie, but will now include it in the ""Romantic Comedy"" overview of my high school Film Studies class. ( ""My Best Girl,"" 1927; ""It Happened One Night,"" 1934; etc. by the decades).",1369526400,,803,4.666666666666667

The two team up with a song (Not without problems that make the movie). Brad Garrett plays Alex Fletcher's (Grant) agent and does a nice job in a support role. Nice music.

1578710,4,B00005JPE3,"Who'd have thought that Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore could pull off something like this? Grant does his standard ""I'm a complete airhead, but I'm terribly lovable"" role, with his usual skill. Drew Barrymore has also made a career out of portraying airheads - bimbos who are a few french-fries short of a happy meal. At first blush, you'd expect a pair of ditzes like these to turn in a Lucy & Desi style slapstick shtick, but surprisingly, the combination works. The humor is generally understated, and Grant's funny lines spin forth with the impeccable sense of timing and delivery that he always brings to his work, while Barrymore does a very creditable job at holding up her end of the farce.

Of course, the plot is pedestrian, hackneyed and unoriginal, hence the down-grading from 5 stars to only 4. Boy meets girl; one of them doesn't like the other much, and anyway they're mis-matched; along the way a relationship develops, breaks, gets mended, breaks again. No surprises here. But the underlying thesis of an autumn-spring romance, while it, too, is far from original, does give both stars a chance to show what they are made of. The awkwardness of the situation, the slow dawning attraction, the petty generational conflicts are portrayed with a sensitivity that we would expect more from a serious drama than a fluffy feel-good comedy like this.

Top marks to the special effects crew for the retro video of the band ""Pop!"". The age regression techniques are utterly believable, such that it's hard to credit that they didn't actually dig out some awful archive footage of Hughie from some forgotten vault.

As a recommendation, I can't do better than report my wife's reaction. She is a person who NEVER wants to re-watch a movie she's already seen. If she is watching a film on TV and begins to recognize it as something she's seen before, she immediately turns it off. So I was stunned, at the end of this film, to hear her suggest that we stay put in the theatre and watch the next showing as well. Is it worth paying good money to view on the big screen? Probably not, unless you're a die-hard Hugh Grant fan who wants to see him, larger than life, swivel his hips like Colin Firth in ""What a Girl wants,"" or you're a latent pedophile who wants to ogle at a giant, nearly naked Haley Bennet faking an orgasm on screen. Otherwise, just get the video.",1322179200,2,2368,4.660287081339713

1578712,5,B00005JPE3,"This charming romantic comedy about a has-been pop singer (Hugh Grant), who enlists the help of a writer turned reluctant lyricist (Drew Barrymore) to help revive his career, is great fun. The film is genuinely funny. It's tender and romantic without being overly sentimental. The casting couldn't be better. Grant in a ""nice boy"" role this time around is very warm, funny, and likable. Barrymore is even more adorable than usual as the neurotic and lovable, amateur lyricist. The musical performances, and songs featured in the film are also highly entertaining especially the theme song, ""Way Back into Love"". The film may appear to be a chick flick on the surface but it really has something for everyone.

1578713,3,B00005JPE3,"`Music and Lyrics' is a pretty standard romantic comedy and seeing Hugh Grant you pretty much know what to expect, bumbling charm and good one liners. This film does have some very funny lines in it, with excellent delivery from Grant and it has some great tongue in cheek comments on both 80's and modern pop music. It's worth watching this film for the opening 80's pop video alone and Hugh Grant is hilarious in 80's garb and showing his dated dance moves. The last twenty minutes or so were a little boring and the ending predictable, but you wouldn't expect too much else from a light hearted comedy. This is 100 minutes of charming chick flick and worth a look if you like that kind of film. It's even not that bad if you're a reluctant boyfriend who's talked in to watching it with a girlfriend or date. Light, cheesy and with some funny moments.

1578793,5,B00005JPE3,"Every few years, a musical comedy comes along that perfectly nails a musical era. The late 70s would be ""Spinal Tap"". The 90s would be ""Singles"". And here, ladies & gentlemen of the 80s generation, we have ""Music and Lyrics"".

I don't know if pre-80s or post-80s people would understand the humour, but gawd I was in stitches from the beginning. The film starts with a frighteningly accurate parody of an 80s pop video: complete with plinky synthesizers, moussed hair, atrocious 80s dancing (you know the moves I'm talking about), slutty nurses with grand cleavage, and men with pants that are so tight you can tell their religion. If this description stirs up any high school memories, then this is the movie for you.

People call this a romantic comedy, which it is, but I think the real comedy lies in the cultural satire. Hugh Grant plays the aging popstar ""Alex"", an ex-80s glamboy who never quite grew up. Over the years he's been reduced to playing highschool reunions and Six Flags themeparks, always eliciting orgasmic screams from the middle-aged women in the crowd but never taken seriously in the real world. Then one day he gets the chance to write a new hit song for a modern pop diva, but he needs a lyricist to make it happen. Enter Drew Barrymore as ""Sophie"" whose lyric writing skills are only topped by her neurotic behaviour. Instant comedy, my friends.

But really, the plot is almost irrelevant. The point of this film is--in the spirit of Spinal Tap--to mock the silliness of what we all were but are too embarrassed to admit, now that we're ""grown up"". My fellow refugees from the 80s, this is your catharsis, a way of exorcising all the 80s demons from your closets. You laugh at the screen, but you're actually laughing at yourselves & loving every minute.

Both Hugh & Drew deliver great, believable performances, and the script is fast paced & witty like an old Katharine Hepburn / Cary Grant picture. But what really made this a great film are the riotous performances by the supporting characters: Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Kristen Johnston (""3rd Rock from the Sun""), and the rookie Haley Bennett as the perfect Britney/Shakira pop diva whose songs always seem to have the word ""booty"" in them. Each of these actors add their own particular quirky comedy to this production.

Don't miss your chance to see this movie. Twice even. And the bonus features on the DVD are a real treat: the Gag Reel (bloopers), Deleted Scenes, and The Making Of featurette. Especially if you were born between the years of 1965 and 1975, you must see this movie immediately.",1268611200,4,2599,4.766666666666667

If you have an HD TV and you love this movie, consider it in blu-ray (I assume it will look much better).

1578796,5,B00005JPE3,"What a treat for anyone who likes good romantic comedies.  I'm amazed at how the critics dismissed this movie - the standard compaint is that it's predictable.  Well in almost any romantic comedy, the end result is, of course, always predictable. But how the movie gets to that end result is what makes all the difference.

I call this movie a masterpiece because it completely delivers on what it's title promises: MUSIC and LYRICS. Almost all the songs in this movie are really good, and perfectly fit into the story of this movie.  Most other movies would have just stuck any ole songs into here. If the songs had been second rate, this would have been a second rate film.
Most of the killer songs were written by some guy named: Adam Schlesinger. If you check out his wiki page, he's had quite an impressive career writing, you guessed it: Music & Lyrics.

Particularly of note: what bonehead decided against releasing the closing number, ""Way Back Into Love"", as a single?
""Way Back Into Love"" was #1 in Hong Kong, #5 in Japan & Singapore, #11 in S. Korea.

Shame on the stupid producers for wasting even one second  making that ridiculous pop Parody included with the extras. The time and money flushed down the sewer on that lame & useless venture should have been saved for the investors. Instead they should just have had the screenwriters & songwriters do an audio comentary on how this movie came about.
Whoever made the decision to waste valuable resources on ""Pop Goes My Heart"", should be blacklisted in Hollywood, and never allowed to work in the industry again.",1261958400,2,1577,4.692028985507246

Another film to be added to my burgeoning list of films that peak before 10 minutes have elapsed, (e.g. America's Sweethearts, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) Music & Lyrics begins with a hilariously dead-on parody of 80s music videos but then devolves into a formulaic romance devoid of laughs or charms; I enjoy Hugh Grant a lot and wanted to like this movie, but couldn't find much to appreciate, let alone treasure.

I was never a fan of Hugh Grant before but I found him funny and charming in this movie.  There was great chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore. I honestly thought Hugh Grant stole the show.  He's funny as a 80s popstar has-been.  The songs are all original and they're fantastic.  I'm even considering buying the soundtrack which is something I rarely do.

Haley Bennet was good as Cora Corman although her acting left a little to be desired but based on her IMDB profile, this was her first feature film, so kudos for her, she held her own against Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore.

I enjoyed it the first time I watched it in the movie theatre with my girlfriend when it first came out. It definitely appeals to the older generations that grew up in the 70-80's.

Drew Barrymore is warm and likeable as Sophie and Hugh Grant is charming as cynical has-been, Alex Fletcher. Alex and Sophie's connection feels real, as we actually see them get to know each other and learn to relate to each other, unlike some rom-coms, where the heroes fall in love over playfull banter alone. The conflicts between them are also real, instead of feeling contrived, and the lessons that each learn are believable and relatable. By the end of the movie, we are definitely rooting for them to reach their full potential, both individually, and as a couple. I like the fact that, despite dealing with the glamorous music industry, this is a normal, ""average person"" story. The final resolution is not a grand gesture to sweep the heroine off her feet. It is just heartfelt honesty from Alex to Sophie. The good acting, the romantic story, and great music make this movie a keeper.

PQ 3.5/5, AQ 4/5. Watched on 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD30K Player. I was very impressed that both actors sang the songs, as well. I had thought I remembered hearing this,but the end credits confirmed it.

The story of ""has-been"" singer meets ""muse"", is one that has been regurgitated in popular culture, but this one has the necessary chemistry and heart to make it believable. The age difference between the two leads was a bit hard for me to swallow, but the film was so much fun,  I set that aside. We wished they had given the characters' romance a bit more time to develop. A few more scenes at the park, or a few more sunsets would have done the trick. There really was not a ""moment"", when we knew they had ""fallen"", but we can forgive that.

The storyline of rooting for a former pop store was funny, and engaging, and the fact that Sophie had, at some point, also lent her talent to someone else, and not really ""risen"" to her potential gave her ""second chance"" at self-recognition relevant for me. For both characters, they were on a journey of second chances, which provided for a cohesive story. We loved the scene at Madison Squae Garden, when Hugh Grant starts singing to Drew Barrymore, and Sophie's sister (from 3rd Rock), were definitely favorites.

I'd give it 5 stars, but the film's pace at times was very slow, and the characters' romance jumped the gun a bit, but overall, this film is highly recommended, not just for ""chick flick night"", but as a fun, high energy evening with friends. It was funny, romantic, and sincere. Great job by entire cast!",1232841600,,1712,4.456869009584665
1578954,5,B00005JPE3,"MUSIC AND LYRICS is one of those sparkling comedies that works so well it seems effortlessly put together.  Smart dialogue worthy of Moss Hart or Preston Sturges.  It also does an exceptional job of deftly tackling conventions of the romantic comedy genre with some fresh zeal.  Hilarious lampooning of yesterday's pop music, today's pop music and pop music in general.  But it's the kind of humor born out of love for the genre rather than sneering musical sanctimony (gag!)  HUGH GRANT and DREW BARRYMORE's considerable comedic talents shine, and they have an easy, organic chemistry.

1578955,4,B00005JPE3,"A nicely done, very enjoyable romantic comedy.  What I liked is the understatement.  Before they meet, Drew Barrymore's character has had some disappointments in life, but is basically content, and Hugh Grant's character is actually fairly happy, too, as he coasts along on the remnants of his past fame.  In other words, it wasn't a broad, high concept film along the lines of ""two broken people meet and heal each other's hurts"".  No, it was more like two quirky, likable people making their lives even better my meeting each other.

And, once Hugh and Drew (love the way that sounds) meet and get along famously, there's no phony misunderstanding or contrived disagreement that they eventually need to overcome.  There's simply a feeling-out process with an awkward (and funny) moment or two along the way, and a touching conclusion as Hugh and Drew realize (as the audience has seen from the start) that their characters are quite a bit more than quirky friends who get along very well personally and professionally.  I guess I liked the fact that the talent behind the film trusted the audience not to need broad histrionics to get immersed in a film.

Other plusses: the gentle fun poked at 80's pop culture (though I thought Hugh's ""80's"" pop hit, ""Pop Goes My Heart"" was actually kind of catchy), nicely developed supporting characters (Drew's sister and Hugh's manager are a lot of fun), and a handful of entertaining extras on the DVD, the medium that introduced me to this delightful film.

  Drew Barrymore is surprisingly good at the ditz substituting for the regular plant waterer. (Yes, plant waterer.)

  Grant is offered the opportunity to write a new song for a pop tart rock queen, Cora Corman played by the drop-dead gorgeous and talented Haley Bennett.

  You can guess the rest. Grant needs to come up with lyrics in a few days . . . and Barrymore is a natural. Boy meets girl and all that.

Drew Barrymore is perfect as the slightly wacky plant-sitter, Sophie, who ends up teaming with Alex to write a song for the newest, hottest, young singing star, Cora (think Britney Spears in the 90's).
Alex thinks the music is the most important part but Sophie tells him that the music is like when you first meet someone but the lyrics are the story, what you learn you get to know them. Big surprise -- this proves to be true for them, too.
The song they write ""A Way Back into Love"" could be the theme song for their relationship. They each have their own kind of insecurities and neuroses and their partnership -- and love for each other --ultimately helps them grow and become much more than they were before. Along the way there's some very cleaver dialogue; hilarious, spot-on musical performances from Hugh Grant and Haley Bennett (Cora); and a great performance from Kristen Johnson as Sophie's sister Rhonda.

In the meantime, however, he plays the fading pop star. Drew (who is MUCH younger than his character) happens into his life and they are ""lucky"" enough to ""bump"" into each other and write a hit song.

I've watched it at least 15 times, and still put it on in the background because the music is just so good and the plot is just so simple and cute. I can't believe Hugh has such a nice voice - he missed his calling as a true pop star!

Hayley Bennett is really annoying (in a good way) as Cora, and the finished song sounds great with her and Hugh singing it!

It's funny... or rather, it isn't--that romantic comedies are often considered trite, mindless entertainment, but yet it's apparently really hard to make a good one. I see a lot more good action movies than romantic comedies, or comedies in general.

Anyway. Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is an 80s pop star has-been. He's reduced to doing shows at theme parks and state fairs for an increasingly older, primarily female audience. But now he's got a chance to make a comeback. Current pop diva Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) wants him to write a duet for the two of them, but only if he can have it ready in a week. Unfortunately for Alex, his usual lyricist is unavailable, Alex cannot write lyrics at all, and the substitute his manager sends is depressing.

Enter Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore). She's the ""plant girl""--that is, she comes by to water his plants--and her comments lead Alex to offering her the job of helping him write the song. Just that much would be a cute movie, but it doesn't stop there.

Sophie can't take it seriously because, while she loves putting words together, an ex-lover who's a professor and a literary writer, told her that her writing sucked.

And that's what made it a truly good movie. Under the witty banter, catchy tunes, and funny situations is the story of two people recovering their confidence and sense of self-worth and falling in love as they do it.

In fact, I think that's where the mediocre romantic comedies fail--they try to make things funny by keeping them light, glossing over problems. But Music and Lyrics was romantic and funny precisely because Sophie couldn't tell her ex off, and Alex couldn't stand up for his song. It's basically the cinema equivalent of a Jennifer Crusie novel.

I tend to enjoy Hugh Grant movies--sue me--so I'm a little biased, but I think he fit this role really well. There was precisely the right balance between earnestness and, well, cheese. It would have been an easy role to overplay, to go over the top with silliness, but he doesn't. The same with Drew Barrymore--though her character's more understated, she's completely believable.

And it didn't hurt that around the same time that I saw this movie, I read Waiting for Nick, or that we we'd been watching the DVDs of Third Rock From the Sun. (Kristen Johnston plays Sophie's sister.)

And oh, yeah, the music. Very catchy. ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" kept running through my head for days afterward.... oh, darnit. Now it's back.",1213142400,3,2588,4.758928571428571

There are some very interesting scenes, like the Bernie-Taupin-meets-stud-flesh lyricist, the buddhist-sex-goddess-rap-blondie and her entourage, and then the scene where he records his song in a couple of hours on his home system. Wow! to have that kind of talent to play all of those instruments 'just like that' and pop out a demo in no time! yuh!

The love interest is properly offhanded and consumed in 'unimportant' pursuits to repeatedly ignore the monster opportunity lying in front of her, so we all respect her the morning after.

I am not so sure about the finale, but there are a lot of lights and things!...and Love...

The special treat here is Grant's character's backstory as the Andrew Ridgeley-type lesser light in a Wham!-like duo.

I found myself singing it for days.

Most delightfully, there's an accompanying 80s MTV-like video of ""Pop Goes My Heart,"" portions of which start the movie.  The whole thing is available as an extra on the DVD.  Plus, there's wonderful 'making of' stuff.  Grant says there that to prep they watched a lot of Duran Duran videos saying they were trying to nail the essence of those loopy things, where a song would be lip-synched and play-acted in the goofiest, kitschiest types of settings, ergo, the operating room setting of their spot-on spoof.

While the story does follow a traditional pattern, I fould that it had just enough twists and turns to make it seem fresh.

I usually don't care for Hugh Grant, but in this case I thought he stole the movie. Again you need several viewings just to catch all of his ""throw away"" lines.

While I am a big fan of Drew Barrymore's recent efforts, I have to admit that I thought that she was a little off here (I like her work much better in ""Fever Pitch"" and ""50 First Dates""), but still plenty here to reccommend.

I have to also mention that I thought that Brad Garrett was excellent as Alex Fletcher's manager, and of course Haley Bennett (as Cora) was this years best guilty pleasure.

1579282,4,B00005JPE3,"The great thing about `Music & Lyrics' is that I expected nothing and got so much more than nothing.  This movie is actually quite funny, and despite its predictability will actually warm your heart.  Both Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant shine here; they make an impressive duo.

The story tells of 80's pop icon Alex Fletcher, formerly of the band `PoP!' who is pretty much nothing more than a has-been at this point.  His band split, his bandmate Colin moving onto bigger and better things while he was reduced to nothing more than performer hits from his former glory to a bunch of middle-aged fans that groan and moan over his perfectly rounded rear.  The biggest break he's seen in ages comes in the form of a celebrity boxing show; that is until a tasty little tart named Cora comes calling.  Cora, the Britney Spears of `Music & Lyrics', just so happens to be a fan of Fletcher's and wants him write a song for her new album that they will perform together.  The problem is that Alex doesn't do lyrics, he's the music man.  Then he meets Sophie.

Sophie is going to be watering Alex's plants for a spell and while she's working away he discovers her talent for lyrics.  She's a born lyricist and so he begs and pleads with her to help him write this pop song for Cora.  She finally agrees (much to the persuading by her `PoP!' fanatic sister) and beautiful music is made, on and off the page.

There is no denying that `Music & Lyrics' is predictable.  They are an unlikely pair; they fall in love; they fight, break up and then ultimately get back together.  We already know this going into the movie but still `Music & Lyrics' delivers so much charm and warmth that its familiarity is easily forgiven.

Both Barrymore and Grant work wonderfully together.  Both have arguably been better (I personally think Grants best pairing was with Bullock and Barrymore was a little funnier to me in '50 First Dates') but together they allow each other to shine and play off each others strengths very well.  Grant plays his character more charming than usual, ditching his trademark arrogance for a character that is genuinely likable.  The supporting cast is also noteworthy.  I am not a fan of Brad Garrett (I don't think there is a television character I loathe more than Robert Barone) but here as Fletcher's manager he delivers a performance that is likable and warm.  Standout though is Kristen Johnson who plays Sophie's sister Rhonda.  She's scene stealing hilarious and works every line beautifully.  Newcomer Haley Bennett nails the ditzy pop princess Cora and isn't half bad to look at either (although in my humble opinion Barrymore blows her out of the water).

`Music & Lyrics' is a nice slice of entertainment pie.  Nothing new but nothing stale either.  It's just good entertainment that is bound to bring a smile to your face.  I'd surely recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good laugh.",1202428800,3,2904,4.678500986193294

1579288,5,B00005JPE3,"Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a has-been 1980's pop star loosely modeled after ""the other guy"" in Wham after George Michael left the group.  Alex embraces his status almost cheerfully and ekes out enough money doing nostalgia gigs at theme parks and high school reunions to lead a very comfortable life.  He then receives some bad news and some good news.  The bad news is that a lot of the theme parks are canceling him as his fame dwindles more and more.  The good news is that teen sensation, Cora, is a fan of his and wants him to write a song for her new CD.  Needing the new song to re-establish his name, and income, Alex tries to find a lyricist to work with.  Enter Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) who waters his plants and spins lyrics off the top of her head as she listens to him work.  Since this is a romantic comedy, one may assume that romance blossoms while they work on the song together.

Music & Lyrics is a rare beast in this day and age, a well-written romantic comedy.  Hugh Grant is always gifted, but it's rare that he's given dialog of this caliber to deliver.  His lines are razor sharp, and his character is surprisingly deep and perceptive.  Sophie also shows some depth and insecurity, but the character leans harder on the natural charm of Barrymore than it does on sparkling writing.  The irreverent look at the music business as well as the tongue-in-cheek treatment of has-beens is a great backdrop for the story and provides a lot of laughs throughout the movie.

It would be hard to find fault with any of the actors.  Grant and Barrymore are at their best as the leading couple and their inherent likeability goes a long way toward making the movie enjoyable.  The other standout performance was Brad Garrett as Alex's manager.  He was born to play supporting roles like this one as the tenderhearted giant.

Music & Lyrics is a particularly enjoyable comedy.  The plot is a fantasy, but holds together well.  Most of the best lines go to Hugh Grant and he makes the most of them, but the movie is filled with strong performances.  I can't find fault with any aspect of the film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.",1200355200,4,2173,4.508951406649617

Hugh Grant is an interesting actor.  He's very capable, genteel and has perfected dry witty humor.  He won a Golden Globe as Best Actor in 1994 for ""Four Weddings & a Funeral"" and was also nominated for ""Notting Hill"" in 1999 and ""About a Boy"" in 2002.  Drew Barrymore was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Irreconcilable Differences"" in 1984, and has made a career as the girl-next-door romantic lead.  As Sophie Fisher, she is a little hyper and klutzy, lavishing water on a plastic plant.  The romance between Alex & Sophie unfolds charmingly.  Newcomer Haley Bennett plays rock star Cora Corman.  Her dance moves and fashionable use of Asian icons testify to the shallowness of her music.  Bennett does a nice job in a role that is meant to be paper thin.  Campbell Scott won a Best Actor award for ""Roger Dodger"" from the National Board of Review.  He's gotten attention because he's the son of George C. Scott & Colleen Dewhurst.  In his cameo as Sloan Cates, he plays an author who apparently transformed Sophie's personal story into a fictionalized best seller.  He does a good job in his brief appearance.  Brad Garrett who won an Emmy as Best Supporting Actor for ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" in 2005 plays Alex's manager who goes to the gigs and cues the musical arrangements.  Kristen Johnson from TV's ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" plays Sophie's sister Rhonda.  Johnson booms her role with such broad strokes that it contrasts with nuanced comedy of Hugh Grant.

1579366,3,B00005JPE3,"I watched ""Music & Lyrics"" over the course of four days, partly because we were having problems with our cable and also because it took me a while to really get into the movie. I'm glad I finally made it to the end, though. In spite of its slow start, this film gets better as it goes on and has a very rewarding ending.

The story is about Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a has-been 80's pop star who is desperate for a comeback. Although Alex is a great composer, he's a terrible lyricist and hasn't met a writer he really meshes with. When Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), a professional plant caretaker, comes over to Alex's apartment to water his plants, she displays a knack for writing lyrics, and Alex convinces her to help him write a new song for Cora (Haley Bennett), a successful young pop artist reminiscent of Britney Spears during her snake-charmer days. As Alex and Sophie work on the song together, one thing leads to another, and they end up falling in love. Of course, Alex manages to screw things up for a while, but with a little assistance, he's ultimately able to patch things up and secure a happily-ever-after ending.

There are a lot of good things about this movie, but there are also a lot of issues with it. I think the script is the biggest problem, because the first 45 minutes of the film really drag, especially during the scenes where Alex and Sophie are writing together. I rarely stop watching movies, but I did turn this one off halfway through and had no intention of watching the rest of it. Curiosity got the best of me, though, and I'm glad I sat through the rest of the film, because it got much better after the halfway point as the pace picked up.

Grant is hilarious in this film. He is a great comedic actor and is so funny when he dances! I was also impressed with his singing in the film (I was sure he was lip-synching at first, but I was wrong). Barrymore was funny as the quirky Sophie, but her character was a bit underdeveloped, and I think the screenwriters could have done more with it. There are also some great supporting roles in the film, including Bennet (wow, that girl can sing!), Brad Garrett as Alex's agent, and Kristen Johnston as Sophie's obnoxious older sister.

The ending of the film was very well-done and came as a surprise to me. I think Alex and Sophie make a cute couple, but the script missed the mark because it never included that magical moment when the characters fell for each other...it was sort of like, ""Oh, we love each other, the end."" The viewers were cheated out of the romance here, which was the whole point of this film.

Still, if you're a fan of Grant and Barrymore and you'd like to see a movie that lightly pokes fun at classic 80's pop groups (the opening and ending montages of this film are brilliant), I'm sure you'll enjoy ""Music & Lyrics,"" at least to some extent. It's still a disappointment to me, though, because I think it could have been so much better than it actually is.",1199404800,3,2974,4.4495412844036695
1579367,3,B00005JPE3,"In Music and Lyrics, Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, a washed-up pop icon reconciled to performing at high school reunions and amusement parks. Drew Barrymore plays Sophie Fisher, an eccentric young woman with a natural gift for lyrics. Fletcher gets a golden opportunity to write a new song for a famous young songstress. However, he only writes music, so he needs to find a lyricist to complete the song and achieve a comeback. Fisher happens by his apartment one day (she's working for his plant-watering service), overhears what he's working on, and supplies a few helpful lyrics. Impressed, Fletcher begs her to help him write the song. After some convincing, the two get to work. Of course, you know what happens next. The two fall in love, write a great song, etc., etc.

The storyline is pretty trite, but nothing can detract from Grant's hilarious lines and perfect delivery. And Barrymore is her usual adorable self. Also amusing are the peeks back into Fletcher's bygone pop career - the hair and dance moves will give you fits.

I'll admit, this movie will NOT change your life, and it's pretty predictable. But if you are looking to pass an afternoon with an agreeable romantic comedy and don't mind knowing how it all ends long before it actually does, curl up with Music and Lyrics.",1199232000,4,1297,4.811659192825112

1579467,4,B00005JPE3,"I actually really enjoyed this movie -- it's a revelation to know that Hugh Grant HONESTLY, TRULY can sing (and shake his hips, something he first revealed in LOVE, ACTUALLY). His character, the washed-up '80's icon Alex Fletcher, is terrific. Ever wonder what those guys do after the girls stop screaming? This might just be the answer.

I loved the songs in the film -- they were genuinely terrific -- and the music video that starts the movie, showing Alex in his glory with his pop band, is a scream (and right on, if you've ever seen an '80's music video). I also loved the setup and Haley Bennett as the 2007 version of a pop star -- totally on the money.

But this is a romantic comedy, and what it lacked was ... a reason for the two stars to get romantic.

Truly great romantic comedies let you know WHY people fall in love (and yes, there really is a reason for all that chemistry). Truly great romantic comedies have fantastic characters who blend together.

This is where MUSIC AND LYRICS stumbles.

While Hugh Grant is terrific in a really wonderful role, Drew Barrymore has much less to work with. Her character seems to be quirky for its own sake, far less likeable than his, and much more the product of a screenwriter's imagination than someone who's real. Though it helped to surround her with other, more real characters (like her sister, who is quite recognizable as the former Alex fan and current weight-loss center manager), Sophie Fisher is just an updated version of the character Lucie Arnaz played in THEY'RE PLAYING OUR SONG on Broadway in 1980 -- a nutty lyricist who seems to be very out of touch with her world.

Granted, Sophie has a backstory -- but it seems that her never-was doesn't quite mesh with Hugh's has-been. There really is no reason for these two to fall in love, which makes the love scenes less interesting than everything else (and they should be the most interesting of all). Basically, Sophie and Alex have little to offer each other beyond the professional -- and that's where the movie bogs down. The screenwriter just ran out of ideas -- and if you feel some letdown toward the end, that's the reason why.

The film does have wonderful dialogue, esp. Hugh's, terrific songs, an interesting setup and some lovely production values. If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably enjoy it. I definitely intend to own it -- I just wish it could have given us the chemistry you really need to go out of the theater sighing ...

Still, four out of five stars isn't a bad way to spend an evening.",1193529600,5,2543,4.58590308370044

1579469,5,B00005JPE3,"On the surface, pairing Hugh Grant with Drew Barrymore seems unlikely. They are separated by generations and seem to run in much different circles: Drew has articulated a brilliant career doing 'the girl next door' while Hugh likes upper-class roles and a veneer of high civility.

Drew and Hugh? It's hard to see it happening --- until you see this film.

Grant is spot-on as a washed-up former pop star, content to bask in the adoration of middle-aged fans at state fairs and dimly lit hotel lounges. Meanwhile Barrymore drops into his world as a plant-waterer, and an inept one at that. The two seem destined to collide, not connect.

Instead a sweet romantic comedy begins to bloom. Somewhat reminiscent of ""L.A. Story"" and its pairing of Steve Martin with Sarah Jessica Parker, this movie captures its audience and makes the romance seem plausible. By the end of the film all of us are cheering as Hugh rediscovers his gifts as a composer, and Drew realizes she's born to create lyrics.

Hugh and Drew. Music and Lyrics. A solid, well-cast piece of work that also features a mellow and wonderful Brad Garrett as Hugh's manager.

Who says a 'chick flick' can't have mass appeal?

1579561,3,B00005JPE3,"Music and Lyrics is a vehicle for two bankable stars, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore - an opportunity for them to demonstrate why we know their names.  It has the consistency of cotton candy and, thanks to their excellent performances and chemistry, manages to maintain its high-wire act from intro to coda.  There is no plot, suspense, or drama in this picture, just the fun of watching Barrymore and Grant interact.  Grant is especially good; his easy-going, self-deprecating wit is smooth and smart.  Barrymore is, as ever, irresistible.

Casting plays a role in the fate of this film.  The use of Brad Garrett as Grant's manager is horribly misguided - Kristen Johnston, by contrast, is inspired as Barrymore's sister - her comic delivery is faultless.  If Haley Bennett is supposed to represent what today's rock idol looks like, then apparently the archetype is a 14-year old girl.  Her performance is sincere - she manages to refrain from winking despite the silliness - but on stage gyrations notwithstanding, she fails to generate enough sexual energy to arouse the interest of a professional football team.

The original songs are very good, which is a blessing - considering how central they are to the story.  What I found most interesting about Words and Music was its soft focus overview of how the music industry has changed from the `80s until now.  Because Alex, Grant, was in a hit group called Pop, we are treated to faux - and very convincing - ""MTV"" - ish rock videos featuring this fictional act.  It immediately calls to mind the very painful end of true pop music, brought about by the launch of MTV, and the fabulously awful idea of combining film and music into something that was neither.

Fast-forward to '07 and we meet Bennett, a kluge of Madonna and Spears.  Her shows, with their lavish production and preposterous sets, remind us that today music is the very last thing pop music is about - it's about teen idols, dance routines, a smattering of the plague often called ""rap,"" and visual effects borrowed from film and TV.  Alex's career has spanned this evolution.  The way that Alex and Sophie work together, and the kind of songs they produce, remind us why standards become standards (read Porter) and groups that were famous once end up on TV shows like, ""Battle Of The Washed-Up `80s Pop Stars"" - where they box each other for the right to perform a song.

In well-written work like 4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL or the sadly overlooked ABOUT A BOY<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-a-Boy-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JL7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About a Boy (Widescreen Edition)</a>...Grant is a mega-star.  He is an actor of seemingly limited range...yet the work he can do within that range is astounding.  He seems to have a dial that says ""CAD"" and he can turn it up or down as need-be.  In BRIDGET JONES...he dials it up.  In MUSIC & LYRICS...it's dialed pretty far down.  He's a charming looser, seemingly happy to lead the life of a has-been pop star from the '80s.  He entertains for high-school reunions and at amusement parks with professional enthusiasm...but no real drive.  He lives comfortably in a gorgeous Manhatten apartment...and doesn't seem to care to be creative or relevant again.

Then an unusual opportunity to write a song for the leading pop-diva of her day (think Christina by way of Britney) AND to perform on the recording gives him a late life chance to become ""famous"" again.  But he needs a songwriter.

Through a series of mild but unlikely events, he teams up with Drew Barrymore...who is a cute, funny presence as always...but frankly, her fast-talking, ditzy persona is wearing thin.  She's no little kid anymore, nor is she even a young lady.  She's a mature woman who needs to grow up...much like Hugh Grant's characters always need to!  I enjoyed her...but the odd-pairing of Grant and Barrymore isn't as sparkling as another pairing with Grant might have been.  Perhaps someone as witty...not just quirky.

Anyway, this is a pretty minor quibble, because the film belongs to Grant. From the absolutely brilliant, spot-on video that starts the film (Grant in '80s attire in an old video for his group's song ""Pop Goes My Heart"") to all his mumbled asides...Grant is just so much fun to watch and listen to.  I chuckled throughout the movie.  Even though Grant is truly coasting a bit in this film...his charm still oozes.  I mean that in a good way!

Kristen Johnson has a small role as Barrymore's sister, and she's an over-the-top delight.  Big, noisy, passionate, funny, sexy and very much THERE...it's time she had a bigger role sometime.  I kept imagining a pairing of some sort between her and Grant...talk about opposites!!

The film takes lots of easy buy amusing jibes at the current state of the music business...particulary in the way the young pop star embraces religions and cultures in a totally non-understanding way.  She is blithely unaware that having a giant buddha (from which she emerges in almost no clothing) as the kick-off to her concert is hugely offensive.  These scenes are like something out of SPINAL TAP.

You could certainly do far worse than spending 100 minutes with Grant and his co-stars.  The film is a triffle, but it is amusing, occasionally truly clever and as far as my wife and I are concerned, the opening video is worth the price of admission!

Not really for little kids, because there isn't really any slapstick or real physical comedy.  It's a film packed full of dialogue...a treat of adults looking for a safe, fun diversion.",1188604800,5,3350,5.060218978102189
1579566,4,B00005JPE3,"One of my favorite pieces of dialogue from this film is when Hugh/Alex tells Drew/Sophie that she can keep the view of her smug ex-boyfriend--a best-selling writer of novels--that literary authors are superior to pop song writers. He follows up those words with a memorable statement by saying that such music greats as The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Bob Dylan and The Beatles are the TRUE poets, the true brilliant writers.

 ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day. When it's cold outside, I got the month of May....now that's real poetry"", Grant says.

There are other great scenes to this movie, all wrapped up in a supposedly run-of-the-mill chick flick. But I say that this romantic comedy has much more to it than any of the critics will be able to see.",1188604800,3,758,4.770992366412214
1579567,4,B00005JPE3,This was surprisingly good.  I thought it would be a chick flick and was not too thrilled when my girlfriend insisted we rent it.  I ended up enjoying it.  It's very funny.  Hugh Grant is has great comedic delivery.  The chemistry between him and Barrymore is believable.  It's an enjoyable fun movie.,1188172800,3,301,4.6923076923076925
1579568,4,B00005JPE3,"Music and Lyrics is everything a romantic comedy enthusiast could hope for. It has a great story (with good chemistry between the leads) a great supporting part by Brad Garret, and plenty of twists and originality to make it something unique and great.

Highly Reccomended!",1188172800,3,273,5.066666666666666
1579569,5,B00005JPE3,What a cute show.  We love Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore and thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.,1188086400,2,89,4.5625
1579650,4,B00005JPE3,"It's easy to dismiss Music and Lyrics as just another light romantic comedy, but that's because the whole ""light romantic comedy"" genre is so easily dismissible.  That wouldn't be fair though, because this is a wonderful little movie that's the kind you like to own and pull of the shelf sometimes.

Drew Barrymore seems to get more charming and polished with each movie she makes - and given the number of roles she's played, that's saying a lot.  As Sophie, the plant girl-turned-lyricist, she bounces between sexy, neurotic and zany with ease; helping Hugh Grant out of his has-been 80's glam-pop malaise and back into a productive career.

Grant's Alex Fletcher has been maintaining a comfortable lifestyle by singing the same songs he performed twenty years ago as part of a pop duo (his ex-partner has become a mega-presence along the lines of Sir Paul and Bono) while he is content shaking his hips at Knott's Berry Farm and other locales.  With the assistance of his friend/manager (Brad Garrett deftly shedding himself of any ""Where's Raymond"" stylings), he's just coasting from one gig to the next, picking up the paychecks.  Opportunity presents itself in the person of Briney-esque Cora Corman (Haley Bennett, delightfully loopy), who wants a new song using a line provided by her favorite guru.

The trouble is that Alex hasn't written anything new in years, in no small part because he has no lyrical ability.  Enter Sophie, a former student of writing and poetry who can't keep her rhymes and thoughts to herself as Alex argues with an edgy potential collaborator.  From there the plot flows along relatively predictable lines, the two fall in love, they break up and he tries to win her back.  But hey... just because it's the old ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy get's girl back"" theme, that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch.

To be fair, Hugh Grant could play a role like this in his sleep, and maybe he has in other movies; but the chemistry between Alex/Hugh and Sophie/Drew is excellent!  Kristen Johnston is a lot of fun as Sophie's older sister (the type A owner of a string of diet franchises).

As DVDs go, it's has the usual extras with deleted scenes and outtakes that make things fun.  But without the charm and appeal that comes from Ms. Barrymore, it would be just another safe date movie.  Instead, it's utterly delightful.",1187740800,5,2360,4.792592592592593
1579651,5,B00005JPE3,"Did we really do that in the 80's? Yes we really curled our bangs up high, wore leg warmers when it was warm, put skrunchies in our hair, and wore endless bracelets and hoop earings.

Hugh Grant is a composer who's career became almost non-existant after the the popular star singer of Pop the group,  left for a successful solo career. We havn't heard this scenario before have we? In real life, splits usually mean doom for the ego-driven splitter.

But oh I fell in love with Hugh Grant and he made me LAUGH. Drew Barrymore fans will not be disappointed, she delivers another winner here. If I wasn't laughing I was saying ""awww"" a lot.

Ok there is music made directly for the movie, and you know that music made to be popular but orginal to the movie and wasn't actually a hit in real life, is usually terribly cheesy and medicre, and now this is officially a run on sentence.....ok - Drew Barrymore moment. But I liked the Cheesy music!

I liked the people, I liked the story, I liked the music. It was enjoyable. It is not Shakespear. But I wasn't looking for hidden deep meanings, just a good movie.

There were so many elements that made this movie an fun movie to watch. It just made me happy.... :o)

1579652,4,B00005JPE3,"I loved this movie. I liked that Warner Bros.decided to release it on a dual disc. Hugh Grant and Drew were terrific in this movie. The only negative to this title is the fact that the movie is about music and there were so many opportunities where they could with this concept. For example, You have Haley Bennett playing a loosely based Britney Spears character with her found spiritual aware and mock music video they should have run with but they didn't. I know the movie was rush to DVD  quickly and the hi-def DVD's were released a month and a half later didn't improve on the very skimpy extra features.

Drew Barrymore is terrific too.  She and Kate Hudson are the two most talented young comedic actresses today, and Drew shines in this film.  Brad Garrett is great as well, playing Hugh's manager.

It is a film about a washed-up singer-song writer of the 1980s, and the songs are wonderful.  Rent the film and you won't be disappointed.",1187049600,3,590,4.615384615384615

When the opening credits started (over a perfectly goofy 80's satire of a music video), I knew this movie would work for me.  Really, who doesn't want to see Hugh Grant playing a washed up 80's pop star?  Happily, Grant works harder than maybe he really needed to in order to infuse his character with some weary charm and sincerity.  Rather than feeling pity or scorn for this has-been, we are made to feel admiration for his enthusiasm for the theme-park gigs, as well as his sincere appreciation for his past success.  I love Drew, but this movie belongs to Hugh Grant.",1186963200,5,739,4.568181818181818
1579655,4,B00005JPE3,"Music and Lyrics isn't exactly anything new. It's a contender for the typical run-of-the-mill romantic-comedy movie but surprisingly it's watchable without being cloyingly sweet.

What made the movie work had to be the lead cast of Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore who play a washed-out 80's pop star, Alex Flecther, reduced to singing at graduation reunions and Sophie Fisher, a florist respectively. A chance meeting brought them both together when Alex was writing a song for superstar Cora Corman played to great aplomb by Haley Bennett. Sophie became his unwilling lyricist and later, lover. Of course, there's Sophie's sister played by the OTT Kristen Johnson who lights up the screen as an  Alex-Fletcher die-hard fan who finally sees his idol up close.

The songs, mostly written by Fountains of Wayne bassist, Adam Schlesinger, work for the most part. Pop Goes The Heart has the sound of 80s Wham while Way Back Into Love is a piece of contemporary pop. Avant and Bloodshy contributes Buddha's Delight sung by the ditzy, Buddha-loving Cora whose character is unbelievably fashioned after Miss Spears. The tear-jerker must be the solo piano onstage performance of Don't Write Me Off by Grant. The surprise here is that the trio Grant, Barrymore and Bennett sing with adequacy and for the most part, they looked like they had fun.

For initial skeptics like me, catch Music and Lyrics for it leaves a sweet aftertaste thereafter.",1186704000,2,1433,5.059322033898305
1579656,3,B00005JPE3,"Hugh Grant looks and acts the part of a ""happy has-been"" who was a hit in the 80's but hasn't done much since.  His agent (Brad Garrett) gets Grant the opportunity to enter a contest to write a song for the latest Britney-clone, a girl named Cora.  His lyricist writes a dreadful song and Grant finds himself turning to his ""plant girl"" (Drew Barrymore) who spouts terrific lyrics while spritzing and watering his plants.  Of course a romance ensues, which is complicated by artistic integrity (hers, not his.)  The light touch of Grant and Barrymore plus the fact that the movie does not take itself too seriously is the saving grace for this film.  It makes for a pleasant evening of entertainment.",1186704000,4,700,4.704918032786885
1579657,2,B00005JPE3,"I normally don't mind Hugh Grant playing the same part in every movie he's in. He's charming enough to pull the whole befuddled guy who won't mature. Except in Lyrics and Music, a movie as generic as its title indicates. And even though Drew Barrimore is usually delightful, she can't save this wreck, with a lame plot and unfunny jokes. And what's with the girl who plays Cora? She's a terrible actress, on the plain side, and I couldn't believe for a second that she's a pop star--or a star of any kind for that matter. Couldn't they have hired anyone with at least a modicum of talent? Maybe they spent all the money paying Campbell Scott--at least, I do hope he got paid a lot; otherwise, what's the point of selling out?

The introduction video --of the 80s band Pop-- is very funny and the song ""Don't Write Me Off Just Yet"" is beautiful, and those are the only two reasons I don't give this lame movie a one-star rating.",1186099200,3,927,4.421052631578948

Drew and Hugh do a good job of bringing us back to the 80's and then back to our current time.  The hip-swiveling and other silly dance moves are very funny...I liked the last shot of the film (during the credits) and how it ties back into the middle...  Good usage of MTV historical shows and references...  Rent for a laugh - you'll miss most of the humor if you weren't old enough during the 80's.",1184630400,,573,4.2592592592592595

Hugh Grant did much of the singing in this movie, which was pleasantly surprising. I thought the chemistry with Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore sparked quite nicely.

Alas, ""Music and Lyrics"" falls into the mundane category.  It starts off alright hitting bulls-eyes about eighties pop culture.  Hugh Grant is at his sarky self-depricating best here.  I thought quite possibly there's going to be a ""This Is Spinal Tap"" style parody.  Unfortunately, there's the most predictable love story afoot here.  Grant is a real pro at carrying this most average of material.  He should be doing more films like ""About a Boy"" instead of this formula product.  Drew Barrymore, appealing as she is, doesn't seem to have the acting heft to carry it off.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the target audience for this movie.

Of course, this is the same Bob, brother that I never had, who has also given me first VHS copies and now DVD's of almost every romantic movie ever made.  They go all the way to Gone With the Wind, Doctor Zhivago (but, we'd be drinking vodka for that one), The Way we Were...  I can see you know where this is going.  Well there now, have I given up enough of myself by telling you that little story?

If you, like me, loves a wonderfully scripted, brilliantly acted film that could make you fall in love with Hugh Grant all over again, just like you did in ""Four Weddings & a Funeral"", this is so the movie to buy.  I'm sick that I missed it at my local theater where I could have gone to a matinee on a Wednesday, where the theater would have been empty except for me and the odd usher who'd come wandering in part way through the film.  And, why is that they're still called ""ushers"" anyway?  I can't remember the last time one helped me to my chair, not that I need assistance getting there!  He's usually the guy who comes and tells me to take my shoes off of the seat in front of me.  I do interject here but I do not put my shoes on anyone's seat...now, if the odd part of my jean were to touch the seat, what's the harm in that, right?

Anyway, my point was that I could have laughed and sung right along to my heart's content.  Heck, I could have been up dancing in the aisles and no one would have even thought of calling for the men in the little white coats to take me away to Betty Ford to join Britney or Lindsay.

Hugh isn't a professional singer or dancer and neither is Drew Barrymore.  But, you'd never know it!  This isn't a film where you're embarassed for them when you see them sing or dance.  They both worked and trained hard and it shows.  Hugh even learned to love the piano and they both did all of their own singing which is part of what makes this film so damn charming.  Can I say damn here...ah well, already did...twice!  Did I also mention that cute Hugh who can always manage a good laugh at his own expense is absolutely perfect with Drew who is lovely, warm, natural and the kind of woman that both men and women fall in love with.

If you're feeling a little down in the dumps.  If you're on Xanax, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin or any of those other mood altering, make you feel better prescriptive drugs, toss them aside (just figurativly my friends...no real tossing of these items please!) and get yourself to this brilliantly uplifting film!  Myself, I buying a brand new copy but I'm going to have to wait until the one that includes the actors and directors talking through the film in Special Features.  For now, I'm just getting my hand on the cheapest copy I can find on Amazon so I can watch it again!

If you're even considering not getting the CD and if you're a girl or a gay guy, what, are you crazy?  You're going to want to get up and dance with your cat or your dog or your stuffed bear for all I care.  You're just going to want to belt it out and dance around your apartment with real and true glee!  Please don't bore me with that I don't do that crap...you know who you are.  And, I should say that is if you've been able to do this at some point in the past.  Those of you who can't, I feel sorry for you...no one will see you my dears.  Some of you have never had an urge to kick up your heels and sing to your shoe or your bottle of shampoo.

Haven't seen a group of good girlfriends in awhile, call them up, pick up several bottles of wine, maybe someone can make a few lemon drops, or cosmos, apple martinis and popcorn.  Bring your coziest jammies and get to know your friends again.  This is a wonderful bonding movie.

This movie sucked this particular woman ""of a certain age"" right in and has made me believe in love again.  Well, maybe at least to hope for it.  I wish it for all of you who don't have it as well.  Beyond that, I just hope you enjoy the film.  I must say that it's offical, I'm head over heels in love with Hugh Grant once again and no, not stalker crazy in love!  But, even if he was single, I don't look a thing like that gorgeous woman he was married to...so, c'est la vie.  Life goes on.  Hope you laugh as much as I did!

Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are thrown together in the oddest and most unlikely of circumstances when Grant, a throwback to the 80's pop music scene, is offered a chance to write a song for an un-and-coming 21st century teen queen that is an almost annoyingly accurate parody of Shakira, Christina Aguilara and a host of other would be starlets you could name.

There's nothing really to say about Music & Lyrics, apart from I was really disappointed in Drew Barrymore's performance, both her & Hugh Grant (who I don't normally like anyway) seemed to be going through the motions just for the fat paycheck at the end of it.

With its tune-filled tale of songwriting lovebirds, ""Music and Lyrics"" pokes good-natured fun at the accoutrements and defining elements of `80's pop music and culture.

Alex Fletcher is one half of a chart-topping duo known as POP! (obviously modeled on the real life WHAM!), that reached icon status in the mid 1980's.  Since that time, while his opposite half (the George Michael of the team) has managed to blaze an amazing career as a solo performer, Alex has had to content himself with life as a certified has-been, appearing as a theme-park attraction and on 80's retrospective shows just to keep his name before the public.  Suddenly, however, Alex is given the chance for a comeback when a Brittany Spears-like singer offers him an opportunity to write a new hit song for her.  At just that critical moment, Alex meets Sophie Fisher, an insecure young woman with a talent for writing poetry, whom Alex asks to supply the lyrics for his melody.  Soon, the two of them are writing up a musical storm and falling in love in the process.

Boasting a litany of snappy one-liners and spectacularly engaging performances by Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, the movie manages to hit its satirical points without reducing its targets to stereotypes and caricatures.  The story, it's true, can't entirely escape the strictures of its romantic comedy formula (Alex has the requisite nervous-Nelly manager who lives in fear that his client will make all the wrong career choices, and Sophie has an overprotective, celebrity-obsessed older sister, who feels compelled to advise her younger sibling on all matters relating to the heart), but writer/director Marc Lawrence at least manages to insert a few narrative surprises along the way.  Above all, the movie wins us over with its wit and charm, its knockabout humor and ebullient spirit, and its dead-on parodies of `80's fashions and music.  The original score by Adam Schlesinger is pleasant and catchy in a slick, commercial-jingle sort of way, and the movie starts and ends with an uproarious takeoff on glam music videos from the mid 1980`s.  Finally, Kristen Johnston, Brad Garrett and Haley Bennett manage to bring warmth and depth to characters who could easily have been relegated to the status of cardboard cutouts in less capable hands.

""Music and Lyrics"" may not be the most credible movie ever made on the theme of romance, but this upbeat tale of love in the music biz hits all the right notes.",1182556800,4,2465,4.956310679611651

Hugh Grant does a wonderful job of being the ""80's has been"" from a group called ""Pop"".  The other lead singer continued on with a very successful solo career and Grant is the one that is still singing old songs and doing Knott's Berry Farm gigs, etc.  It reminds me of the group ""Wham"" from the 80's.

Drew Barrymore is a paranoid writer that is taking over a friend's plant watering job while the friend is on vacation.  She ends up in Grant's apartment and starts to sing her own lyrics to a tune that Hugh Grant is playing.  He loves it, wants to hire her, and thus the story begins.

They start working together to write a song within a few days for the biggest recording star in the world.  They are an odd couple with hilarious consequences to their differences.  This is a great movie for everyone to watch.  I highly recommend it!",1182384000,2,1087,4.38

Yes, this movie is predictable.  Yes the plotline will not be a surprise ending, but it never takes a false step and keeps you laughing until the end credits.

My one complaint is that the pop-up's at the end are a bit hard to read on the small screen -- but perservere!  Trust me, it's worth getting out the reading glasses even if you have to keep hitting the pause button.  (Now I just feel old!)

Haley Bennet did a spectacular job as Cora, acting with intelligence, precision and verve. She was hitting all the right notes and delivered, with Grant, some of the best moments in the film. It is not that Madonna, Xtina and Nina Hagen are spiritual fakes - on the contrary, it is the earnestness of their belief that they can live and mediate spirituality  via entertainment that Haley mirrors in an acting tour de force.

The songs were catchy as well - kudos to the songwriter. Can't get the damn Pop! Goes My Heart  out of my mind  :)

Picture a group similar to ""Wham"". George Michael's gone on to bigger and better things, but what's happened to that other guy - whatever his name was? That's the character Hugh plays. He now makes his living appearing at revivals and state fairs. And even those gigs are starting to disappear. But his life could be changing. The latest teeny bopper sensation is a huge fan and has asked him to write her a hit song to include on her next release. This could be his ticket back into the music business. Unfortunately, he can only write music, he has no talent for lyrics. As luck would have it, Drew Barrymore has an untapped gift as a lyricist. If only he can convince her to help him. A few bumps occur along the way in this amusing, lighthearted movie.

I seldom buy a DVD or a video unless I think it is worth seeing many times.
This is a really nice movie. The figure that Hugh Grant plays reminds me of Andrew of Wham!. The song Meaningless Kiss is absolutely homage toward Careless Whisper. The talented singer Cora Corman is fascinating and makes the movie more enjoyable.
At least in Japan, I think most of the people who saw this movie rated excellent. (though I am not really sure about the standard in America.)

The movie opens, (and closes with a great VH-1 pop-up video version), with ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" by fictional 80's sensation ""Pop"". This will jog memories of Wham, Duran Duran, and the like. Think ABC's ""Poison Arrow"" or Erasure's ""Respect"". This 80's style video is dead on, complete with bad acting plot and performance video intertwined. The song ""Meaningless Kiss"" is a dead ringer for Wham's ""Careless Whisper"", another 80's charmer that deliciously took itself way too seriouly. Now getting to the steamy sexual Cora Corman, the writers have her right on point as a cross between Britanny, Shakira, and Xtina. The fellows will like Cora's body, skimpy outfits, and moves, and surprisingly it's lewd enough to make the film just a bit family un-friendly. Cora's ""Buddah's Delight"" is a great take-off of Brittany's ""Toxic"". Cora's faux spirituality is a great take-off of Madonna's showcase of her unorthadox religion, something she might teach to her daughter, (or grandaughter), someone just like Cora. What Cora does with the song submitted to her, ""Way Back Into Love"", (a lovely song, actually), is a great example of how today's remixs can rip the very heart right out of a song. This is all done so well, and while Hugh Grant will never be confused with a great singer, he holds his own here. Delightfully sinful 80's parodies intertwined through a very entertainig movie is what we have here. RELAX & Enjoy!",1181606400,3,1565,4.9543726235741445

Hugh Grant is irresistibly funny as an ""80's has been,"" a former member of a boy-toy pop band that had its 15 minutes of fame twenty years ago.  As he is reduced to doing theme parks and class reunions, the opportunity arises for him to taste the big time again by penning a song for the latest teen female singer.

While Hugh Grant is engaging, the same cannot be said for Drew Barrymore, who is so hyper-neurotic that she belongs in a Woody Allen movie.  Plus, she looks tired and washed out.  The actress playing Cora is dead-on as a vapid, sexed up singer with Indian/Eastern/spiritual pretensions.

Throughout this production the attention to all the details of film making was absolute perfection and just taking a moment to notice can give a sense of how collaborative movies must be.  First, in almost every restaurant scene notice how excellent the lighting is--the characters look great, there is a totality and even-ness that is difficult to achieve and done to a turn here.  The overall production design couldn't be better.  The New York apartments look fairly realistic for people making +$100,000 a year and that's to say rather small.  None of the old Doris Day-Rock Hudson penthouses!  Plus Drew Barrymore is costumed with such care--even though she is wearing layers--it looks like the pre-production planning included her losing weight to account for the bulk of the clothes.

Many of the songs were written by Adam Schlesinger (my apologies for possibly butchering the spelling of his last name) from the great rock band Fountains of Wayne.  The satire of 80's bands (particularly Wham!) was generally well-done, although I felt there was a lot more they could have done with it.  The opening faux ""music video"" for Pop Goes My Heart was hilarious.  Hugh Grant does his usual witty British guy shtick, which I did enjoy for the most part.  Drew Barrymore...well...seemed to be trying to channel Annie Hall era Diane Keaton but I'm not sure that she's a good enough actress to really pull that off.  Having said that, I suppose the romantic story line was decent enough...nothing outstanding, just kind of routine, ""seen it before"", to be honest.  There were some good supporting actors (Brad Garrett is always appreciated) and the story moved along at a nice pace, but going back to my original point, 80's synth/pop music is just RIPE for satire/homage and I was hoping for so much more from this movie.

I certainly got the idea from watching it (and perhaps you would have too if you had watched the entire thing) that great songs have heart and passion behind them and you don't have to sex it up to get people to like it.

1580321,2,B00005JPE3,"""You are gold and sil-vuhh-uhh-uhh"" is my favorite line in the hilarious opening parody of an MTV video circa 1984 starring PoP!, a Wham!-like duo that has a shaggy-headed Hugh Grant portraying the lesser half who has since resigned himself to has-been status. From that high point, one would have hoped for a skewering Spinal Tap-type of satire on the music business. Unfortunately, director/screenwriter Marc Lawrence bolts securely into the far more predictable route of studio-manufactured rom-com in this 2007 comedy. The direct and irrefutable consequence is a contrived confection leavened only partially by the two undeniably charming stars.

The plot focuses on Alex Fletcher, who is perfectly content being a washed-up pop star playing amusement parks and other second-rate venues to support what looks like a comfortable lifestyle. In an ironic twist of fate, Britney doppelganger Cora Corman, a top-ten pop diva into Buddhism and Indian music, turns out to be a Pop! fan and wants Fletcher to write her a song with the title of her favorite self-help mantra, ""Way Back Into Love"". Fletcher can write music but not lyrics. Enter Sophie Fisher, who has come to take care of his plants and turns out to be a frustrated writer. She is also reeling from a failed romance with a novelist who has written a best seller capitalizing on her insecurities. The rest of the plot is strictly by the numbers.

Grant and Drew Barrymore are adept at this type of soft-centered comedy, though they seem to be working strenuously in a vacuum and are frankly too similar in personality type to draw real sparks. In particular, as Sophie, Barrymore is given a character so bereft of self-confidence and plain common sense that it becomes painful to watch her channeling early Goldie Hawn movies. Usually an easy scene stealer, Brad Garrett barely registers as Fletcher's manager, while Campbell Scott is hardly onscreen as the dexterously manipulative novelist. Haley Bennett is too pallid a presence to be credible as a pop superstar, while Kristen Johnston is underused as Sophie's loutish older sister. There is a standard package of extras with the DVD - the disposable making-of featurette, deleted scenes, a gag reel and that amusing Pop! video that promised much more.",1179705600,7,2267,5.091397849462366

I did not see the humor in more glorification of pop culture nor was I surprised at a possibility of romance. Guess why not? I was so bored, I did not even finish looking at this film because it reflected a culture I do not want in my home, even if it had its point eventually. Brad Garrett, of course, is always welcome. I expected more from Hugh Grant because his performances do specify a special niche he has created for himself and that is what I want. Anything less is beneath him and is not something I would watch or buy!  Sorry, guys.  Let's get better! I must disagre with the majority.",1179532800,3,742,4.36231884057971
1580324,4,B00005JPE3,"Music and Lyrics is exactly what you'd expect.

Hugh Grant plays the charmingly sarcastic character that his fans know and love.

Drew Barrymore, doe-eyed and quirky, as only Drew can.

The story is feel good, with enough tension and humor to make it worth the time investment. Some clever dialogue, a nice blend of artist angst, and a good support cast. A half-dressed prone-to-writhe teen pop star is over the top. I wish one of Sophie's issues had been fully and satisfyingly concluded, but the lack of follow through didn't ruin the story. If you are at all a fan or mocker of 80's rock videos - it's worth the cost of the rental fee just to see Pop!

If you are expecting something beyond an amusing and light-hearted chick-flick, you'll be disappointed.

Hugh Grant's music video ""Pop Goes My Heart"" was really cute, and I was surprised to learn that he did his own vocals (he was great!).  This movie has hilarious one-liners, a charming romance between Grant and Barrymore, and good music.  It was well cast, with the new actress who plays Cora being the perfect addition, and everything works together well to make it a fun movie to watch and re-watch.  Although to my disappointment, I've bought some DVDs lately that have no special ""features"" on them at all, this one had several, and they provided interesting background to the making of the movie, including a ""gag reel"" that provides some good laughs.  The music video ""Pop Goes My Heart"" is added as a special feature by itself, too.

It is a good old fashioned romantic comedy, without any gimmicks or tricks up its sleeve.  You will find yourself smiling throughout the film, and laughing out loud quite a few times.  Even though Hugh and Drew may seem like a weird combination, they work.  The film is genuine and sweet (not saccharine), the music rocks, and the casting is spot on.

Usually I will simply ""tolerate"" the Romanctic Comedies, but this is one of those exceptions where I really dig the movie. From the 80's style music to the parody of current pop acts, the soundtrack alone is worth the viewing. Hugh Grant is a believable (and funny) ""80's Has Been"", and Drew Barrymore (who I normally don't care for) is actually pretty good in this one. It's heavy on the humor and light on the drama which is nice. I would definitely recommend this movie.",1179360000,2,652,4.533898305084746
1580329,3,B00005JPE3,"Although terribly predictable and not just a bit trite, MUSIC AND LYRICS is saved from depravity by some good acting by lead actors Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, and by the excellent usage of dialogue and music videos from bygone days.

Falling well into the category of romantic comedies, Music and Lyrics starts out with a bang by showing Grant in tight leather pants with the heavy 80s hairdo during an MTV-style music video with his old band ""Pop!""Although not the lead singer for the group, Alex Fletcher (Grant) is second-in-command during the band's heyday. But like many rock-n-rollers, their group disbands and the first-in-command launches out on his own, leaving Fletcher as a has-been.

Jump ahead a few decades and we find Fletcher grasping at anything he can to keep his name in any sort of musical light. Suddenly an offer comes his way via his failing manager Chris (Brad Garrett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everybody-Loves-Raymond/dp/B000N8UXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everybody Loves Raymond</a>). He must compose one song for a superstar named Cora (Haley Bennett). She's ""bigger than Brittany"" Fletcher is told and she needs a song with some umpf! to wrap-up her latest album. A lyricist is quickly dispatched to Fletcher's apartment but they immediately clash. As they try to agree on the lyrics and the music, a young and somewhat neurotic house plant caretaker begins humming the song and coming up with her own lyrics. Fletcher catches her words and incorporates them. And thus Sophie (Drew Barrymore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-s-Angels/dp/B000P6BFGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie's Angels</a>) becomes his new lyricist.

Grant really steals the show here, his line delivery flawless and his portrayal of an aging rocker pulled off exceptionally well (when he nearly dislocates a hip on stage, it's laugh-out-loud funny). Nothing can be taken away from Barrymore, however. She plays fine beside Grant but just isn't up to his level. But this is probably the best role many viewers have ever seen her in. She's not throwing punches or high-kicking some bad guy in the face. She's a character here and not simply a vehicle for action.

The supporting cast also pulls this common storyline up a notch. The previously mentioned Brad Garrett is terrifically funny as Hugh Grant's manager, and so is Kirsten Johnson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3rd-Rock-from-the-Sun/dp/B0007WQGVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3rd Rock from the Sun</a>&nbsp;TV series) as Barrymore's older sister and someone who was obsessed with Grant's old ""Pop!"" band. Newcomer Haley Bennett plays the airheaded pop star to a tee, rightfully making you cringe every time she opens her mouth (""We need to go to the roof. That's upstairs"") or puts on some sleazy piece of clothing.

Keep your expectations on an even keel, though. The ending is straight out of Hollywood's happy ending catalogue but the dialogue will keep you engaged enough for an enjoyable ride.",1179360000,2,3104,5.753812636165577
1580330,4,B00005JPE3,"This movie was very enjoyable as it brought the cheesy pop music scene of the 1980s to today's world. The scenario driving the movie involves a former pop star who is relegated to performing at theme parks. He has an opportunity to write a song for the songstress-of-the-day, but he cannot do it alone. He needs the help of his plant sitter (who turns out to have the talent of coining wonderful lyrics). Their resultant effort to write the song causes them to fall in love, albeit awkwardly. They decide it cannot work, but come together for the final credits. The only drawback is some worthless side story about Barrymore's character being involved with a prof during college. That was useless and not developed. That aside, the movie was very enjoyable. It was not the greatest movie ever, but it did not have any pretensions to that title. The characters are believable and sympathetic. Their interaction with one another is fun as well. But the story is not very deep. It is rather shallow, but it does not need anymore depth to be enjoyable. The opening credits also hold the benefit of a mock 80s video that is right on target.

I approached this movie with high hopes and low expectations, and was very, very pleasantly surprised.

People who are falling in love, or people who are blowing up everything in sight?  If you opt for the lovers, this movie is top-notch.  Grant is charming, Barrymore is radiant, and together they strike real sparks.  The dialogue is witty and Grant, particularly, delivers his lines with understated precision and a sharp understanding of how Alex Fletcher's weary old world works.  Each character spurs the other to grow, as people do in good relationships, and each character has to overcome his or her own fears to make the relationship work.  Perhaps best of all, this is no damsel-in-distress romance, where the big strong hero sweeps in to save and win the girl.  Both Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher come with a full set of problems and hang-ups.  As each lends the other a new perspective, both develop new images of themselves and what their futures might look like.  In the end they are lovers, partners, and equals.

But really it is a very well done film. Hugh and Drew actually work well together; their chemistry is believable. The story itself is pretty solid from beginning to end without losing direction- and it is just a overall lighthearted romance that instead of being very sappy turns out to be actually funny.

But I watched this the other night and it was a pretty ..ok..movie for a RomCom. The begging with the 80's music video for his group named PoP was pretty hilarious (specially the heart attack scene). The rest of the movie, was...I don't know..decent I guess. It had some ok chuckles in it. The chemistry between the two was somewhat believable.

It really was your basic romantic comedy from A-Z.

1580437,4,B00005JPE3,"The best part of this movie occurs at the very beginning and end of the film.  It starts off with a video of the fictional eighties band PoP, which prominently features Hugh Grant on keyboards.  The film ends with a ""pop up"" version of the same video, which cleverly sums up not only what happens in the film but takes us a bit beyond.

This is more or less a formula picture and it is a fairly successful one.  There are films that try to break new ground and films that merely try to successfully tread over ground broken by other films.  This film is of the latter.  Look, it is all quite simple:  you either like the genre or you don't.  If you like romantic comedies, you will like this.  If you don't like the genre, you will despise it.  Ninety percent of the film revolves around Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant being themselves and saying lines that were tailored for them.  I enjoyed the film, but I would like to see more from both actors.  Both are talented but both have also been coasting for a while, taking on the kinds of roles that either could do in their sleep.  I miss the Drew Barrymore who did films like EVER AFTER and RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS and the Hugh Grant who plays someone other than Hugh Grant.  I know that Grant has frequently considered retirement so I suppose a film like this is preferable to nothing, but I don't anticipate retirement from Drew anytime soon.  I'd like to see her take more risks.

Still, I enjoyed this.  I love romantic comedies and so am predisposed to enjoy a film like this.  If you like the genre as I do, you'll like it also.

The music is decent thanks largely to Adam Schlesinger of the band Fountains of Wayne.  He has a wonderful touch with light pop singles.  This is not the first film he has written pop hits for.  A number of years ago he wrote the title song for THAT THING YOU DO.",1179014400,2,1850,4.270893371757925

It's meant entirely as a fun movie lightly tip toeing around our youth (I'm 43), changing times and changing taste in music, the difference in the big stars of today and the pop stars of yesteryear.

There just aren't a lot of layers and I kept feeling like there could have been moew moments that would make me care more about these people. The editing is akward at times (take a look at the back shot of Hugh singing in the cafe--his mouth is no where near the song's words!) and the sets are a little staged.

1580471,5,B00005JPE3,"Light, smart and very funny, this is a film even families can enjoy together. Drew Barrymore is a lovable ditz, Hugh Grant a self-mocking charmer in this winning screwball comedy. Their charms drive a plot that's a satire of the music industry. Grant plays Alex Fletcher, a 1980s pop star who's been hired to write a song for current bootie-shaking teen queen Cora Corman (Haley Bennett). But when he needs a lyricist, who should stumble into his life but klutzy Sophie Fisher (Barrymore), a former English Lit major who can pop out pop phrases effortlessly. The chemistry between Barrymore and Grant is perfect, and supporting actor Brad Garrett plays Grant's manager with just the right deadpan touch. As for watching with your kids, Barrymore and Grant do sleep together, though all you see is the couple falling down on the bed together and then waking up the next day.

The only flaw? The more the movie addresses its plot the more it loses its pitch -- Barrymore and Grant are tremendous when they flirt, good when they make out, OK when they break up, and straight-by-the-book when they get back together. I gave the film five stars because it starts with such promise and delivers on it so well for most of an hour. To be fair, by the time the movie ends it's really just a, well, four-and-a-half.

The DVD includes some memorable extras. Deleted scenes include some fun moments with some apartment desk clerks, as well as two great bits with costar Brad Garrett striving to balance business needs with quality time with his pre-teen daughter. A full-length version of the film's fictitious 1984 music video ""PoP Goes My Heart"" features Grant shakin' bacon in a dead-on Duran Duran parody.

Alex's manager Chris (Brad Garrett) usually only comes up with nostalgia gigs at fairs, amusement parks, and reunions, and even those are drying up.  But then Chris comes up with the potential comeback vehicle.  Pop sensation Cora Corman (Haley Bennet) is looking for a new song.  Unfortunately, it has to be done in only a few days, and Alex can't write lyrics.

Sophia (Drew Barrymore) has recently started watering Alex's plants, and her mutterings while he's working on the song show she has a wonderful way with lyrics.  He immediately enlists her to write the lyrics for the songs.  While she resists at first, she eventually gives in and the two begin to work on the perfect love song.  And sparks begin to fly between them.  Will this turn into something more?

This is a charming, witty romantic comedy.  It combines funny situations with witty dialogue.  It even mocks 80's music (especially in the hilarious Pop music video that opens the film) and today's pop divas.

Yet it has heart.  The plot is predictable, but the characters are great and easy to root for.  I even found myself chocking up a time or two.

And the acting is spot on.  Hugh Grant is a great singer as well.  Drew Barrymore isn't as strong at singing, but she really only has to sing in one song.  Brad Garrett plays more of a straight man then I expected.  Haley Bennet is hilarious as the current pop sensation and easily stole every scene she was in.

Obviously, music plays a major part in the movie.  They've got everything from 80's pop cheese to a modern duet.  None of the songs are annoying, however.  In fact, the music is so fun I'm quite tempted to go out and get the soundtrack.

The movie's PG-13 rating comes mainly from the sexually suggestive dance moves done by the singers.  This isn't anything you haven't seen on MTV, but the movie still would have been better off without it.

I'm not much of a Hugh Grant fan, but here he does a great job embodying a has-been who is trying desperately to hold onto some thin shreds of pride while cashing in on a one-hit career at state fairs and theme parks.  His character could be bitter or deluded, but he's making the best of what he has and he knows it.  The scene where he performs at a third-rate theme park in a pavillion the size of a bathroom stall is both cruel and touching.

Drew Barrymore's character is frazzled and damaged, but so cute that you'd forgive her for running over your dog.  There isn't a fiery chemistry between Grant and Barrymore, but instead an affection and sweetness that usually glides under Hollywood's radar.

Kristen Johnston isn't an obvious choice for Barrymore's sister, but she does an amazing job with her piece of the movie and it's a pity that casting directors can't make better use of her talents.

Special mention needs to be made of the delightful ersatz-80's compositions.  I heard about the movie on NPR, and the snippets of the songs broadcast on the radio told me that I had to see the movie.",1178668800,6,1358,4.551440329218107

Trouble is he isn't cut out for any sort of comeback.  That is until he meets an oddball songwriter, Sophie Fischer (Drew Berrymore) to be his ""soul (mate) and inspiration"".  Having an older sister (played likably enough by Kristen Johnsten) who is a rabid ""Pop"" fan (the name of Alex's hit band) and a manager, Chris Riley (Brad Garrett) who always tells people what they want to hear, Alex has a chance.  The tension develops when artist integrity splits up their songwriting motivation.  (She won't stand for the ridiculous ""religious"" rendering of their song for popstar Cora Corman [Haley Bennett].)

'Music and Lyrics' works well with the tender notes, but the comedy is hit and miss.  Starting with a ""Pop"" video that takes every 80's musical and lyrical cliche', the movie begins as a promising parody.  Recalling a review of his solo album, Alex relates that 'Rolling Stone' said it was ""crass, contrived, and not worthy of the dentist's chair"".  When less sharp and more flat, we get fake plants being watered, late night sessions with Alex repeatedly playing the 'Jeopardy' theme, and Sophie shouting out, ""I'm going to have a baby!"" to hail a cab.  When Alex announces his intention to relaunch his career, Chris quips, ""We might even get [to play] Disneyland!""

Benign and often heartwarming, 'Music and Lyrics' has enough appeal for a mainstream audience.  Sometimes it tries too hard for its own good, even if Grant and Barrymore develop some genuine chemistry that works with mixed material.",1178582400,7,1729,4.958333333333333

His good friend and manager, played as the straight man by Brad Garrett, is always at his side.  Alex still has enough ""fame"" to think he needs a lady to take care of his plants.  Sophie (Barrymore) is the neurotic plant lady with a damaged soul from a past relationship.  Suddenly, Fletcher gets the chance of a lifetime.  He gets the opportunity to write a song and perform it with the current teen pop sensation Cora Corman.  Except Alex can't write songs.  He soon finds out the Sophie is a natural song writer.

The rest of the movie follows Alex and Sophie as they attempt to write a song, and in the meantime spend a lot of time together.  I don't know how much chemistry the two characters had, but Grant and Barrymore are such good actors, that it was enjoyable to watch.  Kristen Johnston plays Barrymore's sister and is obsessed with ""Pop"" and Alex Fletcher.  The unique part of the film for me was the music.  Grant can sing and gives several good/amusing performances.

While this isn't the best romantic comedy ever, it should still be something you can enjoy.  The acting is solid, the script is humorous and the supporting cast is good.  Haley Bennett turns in a sultry peformance as Cora Cormon and some of her dance numbers are something you definitely will want to keep your kids away from. This is otherwise a fun, enjoyable date movie.",1178582400,6,2016,4.591036414565826

Lots of fun ... in an age where movie produces feel they need to be making serious statements about youth suicide etc. thank God for movies like M&L which are just fun & light making for a good night out. We came out of the theater feeling good about people and the world... Why? Because of a good script, producer and actors. We'd give it 6 stars if we could.

A perfect movie to watch, when you want to be entertained with a sweet script that isn't laced with profanity nor nudity.  A movie you can watch with your teenager and not be embarassed by its contents.  Hugh Grant is very funny and who knew he could sing.

However ... I do need some level of writing skill and some level of commitment from the actors.  These two very attractive and talented people seemed to phone this one in, and it was more a sketch than a fully developed screenplay.  There were a few good moments between Grant and Barrymore, but not enough to earn more than two stars.  Recommended only for the hardest core fan of these two actors.",1177804800,6,619,4.301724137931035
1580550,4,B00005JPE3,"Alex, 80s pop star has-been played by Hugh Grant, is given a chance to compose a song for a hugely popular teenage singer. But Alex, who has not written anything for these ten years, cannot come up with an idea for the new song's lyrics until he finds a song-writing partner in the most unexpected place - in his own room, where a slightly off-beat young woman Sophie comes to water plants.

Sophie is played by delectable Drew Barrymore, whose natural charms would make us forget the film's contrived story (which sounds like an episode from the pop song history like Carole King and Little Eva). Hugh Grant, who really sings and dances for the film, shaking the hips one hundred times, is very funny as washed-out pop star together with some clever send-ups of 80s pop music scene.

Writer-turned-director Marc Lawrence has already made ""Two Week Notice,"" a romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock. The new film is much better, with two attractive stars and even more attractive supports - Brad Garret as Alex's manager and Kristen Johnston as Sophie's elder sister Rhonda. Rhonda actually steals every scene from Drew Barrymore, which is a feat in itself, and so is newcomer Haley Bennett who is impressive as Britney-like sexy teenage star.

You may think you have had enough of love stories and romances. And sure, ""Music and Lyrics"" goes down the beaten path of romantic comedy, but that is not a bad thing as it has charming stars and genuinely funny moments. It is a silly, old romance, but I love the film just because of that.",1177200000,,1551,4.737037037037037

The story,outwardly,is about Alex (Hugh Grant) who is a former '80's POP Idol, and Sophie (Drew Barrymore) a ditzy jingle writer/plant-killer whose aspirations as a burgeoning poetess have come to a screeching halt,who unexpectedly find themselves commissioned to write a hit for the Britneyesque Superstar,Cora. That said,the film actually exposes the shallowness of the music industry and it's callous disregard for the artist's material. Money is the name of the game....not art! Both Sophie and Alex have epiphanies which is satisfyingly appropriate for this light-fare romp. What makes this movie  are the infectious and well performed songs that have been composed for this film. They are wonderful and the soundtrack alone is worth the film itself. The catch?.....Hugh Grant is actually performing his songs....AND HE IS GOOD!!!!Barrymore also does a little singing herself which is charming, but Grant REALLY outdoes himself in this film. Whether or not you are a Grant fan, the talent this man exhibits as a comedian and as a viable singer is palpable.

1580552,5,B00005JPE3,"I was dragged to this one by my wife.  Once in the theater, I was astonished to discover the best romantic comedy in years.

By that, I mean a film in which characters carry on in ways that actually approximate rational, adult behavior, do moderately funny things and arrive at a satisfactory romantic conclusion.  Twenty or thirty years from now, I suspect that film school (or whatever they might be called at that time) syllabi will call this one of the few romantic comedies of the early 21st Century able to stand comparison with the giants of the 20th, such as ""Pillow Talk"" or ""Libeled Lady.""

Let me point out the very welcome presence of two natural second bananas: Kristen Johnson and Brad Garrett.  Neither is right for a leading role in this sort of material, but as supporting players they are nearly as valuable as Patsy Kelly and Tony Randall were in their respective heydays.

Dru Barrymore managed to be perfectly satisfactory, despite a total lack of character in her part as written.  She IS a Barrymore, after all.  Haley Bennett, as the pop diva, nicely conveyed the inner essence of a perfect vacuum.

A particular surprise to me is how very good Hugh Grant was in the retro-80s pop numbers.  As I write this, I am still not sure whether Grant is simply an unusually good musical performer or whether the real pop idols of the 80s were so abysmally awful that he shines by comparison.  Very likely there is a certain amount of truth in both propositions.",1176595200,3,1476,4.638461538461539

It was filmed at ADVENTURELAND amusement park here in Farmingdale (where I live), Long Island, New York, where it lasts 5 minutes in the movie and Hugh Grant sings!  This is a cute movie, and it is good, and I am not saying that because I am in it.  Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore make a good couple, and Grant's never been better!  I cannot see anyone else playing that role!  The inside of Nassau Coliseum is supposed to be the inside of Madison Square Garden in New York City, when the concert of Cora takes place, near the end of the movie; they did film outside Madison Square Garden though.  (I heard Drew is nice; she visited Target next door to Adventureland when they were filming)  They filmed 5 days at Nassau Coliseum (spent 14 hours at the Coliseum on the last day of filming), and the concert scene is only on screen for 10 minutes.

At one point, Sophie Fisher tells Alex Fletcher that you need to be inspired and stand up for yourself. I wish the powers that were involved in this movie followed that advice. Having said that, the movie is still watchable and the primaries are adorable in their roles. Drew Barrymore as Sophie Fisher is charming. Hugh Grant is delightful as Alex Fletcher, especially here in his singing debut. The best scene of the movie is when we first see Grant perform in a hotel in front of 30 or so adoring fans. If only the movie could retain such magic throughout, it's be a delightful film. It's also hard to buy Barrymore and Grant as a couple and the romantic involvement seems strained rather than fun and, well, romantic. The soundtrack is really good and is alone worth watching the movie for it (on DVD, not in theaters).",1174780800,2,918,4.638036809815951
1580558,3,B00005JPE3,"There's one thing about this movie that is truly remarkable, and that's when you realize that there's more to Hugh Grant's current existence as an actor than being a suave Brittish leading man. In this movie he plays a character that has failed, doubts himself, and lacks the confidence to say the things to make his life work better, even though he knows what they are. It's so interesting of a performance in a film that doesn't really deserve it.  There are times in this movie that are just obviously half-baked from a directing standpoint, but the reason this movie works is credit to Grant, Kristen Johnston who plays Drew Barrymore's sister, and the credible songwriting and re-creation of the sound of the 80's synth-pop. Some of the movie works great, but the director obviously didn't pay much attention to other elements of the film, for instance, the music is great as is the filming of it. ""Pop Goes My Heart"" could've been a hit back then and the video matches this.  A lot of people feel the video is the best thing about the film, and I disagree. The movie is at its best when it shows the music performed and the music's affect on people, which is why Kristen Johnston's performance is so great. She nails the crazy in the heart fan that this music must have caused, she never ceases to be fun in a film that isn't always fun.  His handling of the romantic angle of the film is the worst part about it and part of this goes to Drew Barrymore, who can be good, but her performance here lacks...gravity.  I didn't believe her performance, or her backstory at all, and Campbell Scott is wasted in this thankless role playing her former. She was never in character the whole film as if she just ended up on set and was thrown head first into it, without any preparation. Mr. Grant could teach her a few things about a good performance.  As for the pop star, yes, this happened years ago with Britney and is far more over the top sexually.  Do we really want our make believe pop stars to be as unbelievable and pretentiously slutty as  the real ones? I don't think so I don't blame them for toning it down,  but for me, she didn't register at all. She was simply a faceless person. When I listen to the songs her character sings, it's clear the actress wanted to be remembered for her vocal performance and not the other way around, or at least make them as good as the other. I would've preferred to have a bad singer who could make a memorable acting performance. Isn't it strange how things often work out? To me it would seem that Britney is the least talented at singing, and instead tramps it up and dances her head off to become famous, and so many singer who are more talented don't make it because they're faceless by comparison. When you're making music meant to be marketed it's just important, if not more important that you have a media hungry and affable personality than music that is played well. I just find it interesting that Haley Bennett didn't feel that way since her music comes off well enough. In the end, Grant and Johnston's performances along with the music make the entire thing digestable. By the way, Grant and Barrymore surprised me by just how good they were both together and Grant singing by himself. They are solid in that department even if the rest of it isn't.",1174780800,4,3312,4.490033222591362

At least, he was with teenage girls.  20 years later he is a has-been who works state fairs.  Miraculously, his agent Chris (Garrett) hooks him up to with a chance to record a duet with Cora (Bennett), the latest big name pop star.  The only condition is that he needs to write a duet in less than a week.  Not having written anything new in a long time, this seems like quite the challenge until Sophie (Barrymore), the woman who waters his plants, shows some lyrical skill.  She is reluctant to help him, but eventually caves in and soon they are writing a song and falling in love.

Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are no strangers to the romantic comedy, and for the most part, they bring their A game.  The video of Grant from his 80's heyday is almost worth the price of admission itself.  The two have good chemistry, and there are some genuine laughs to be had.

1580631,4,B00005JPE3,"Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, the former guitarist of the 80's sensation band Pop! In the aftermath of teen stardom, Alex is now a struggling has-been who makes a living by performing at state fairs, amusement parks and 80's high school class reunions. When his manager contacts him about an opportunity for a resurgence to fame by writing a song for current reigning queen of pop music, Cora, Alex jumps at the chance. The only problem is he was never any good at writing songs by himself. He always did the melody and his former bandmate Colin (the only member of Pop! who has gone on to make a name for himself) wrote the lyrics. In order to get this song done right and on time--he only has two days--Alex has to find a lyricist, and fast.

Drew Barrymore plays Sophie Fisher, a twenty-something with no definite career path who spends her time working in her sister's chain of weight loss stores, babysitting her niece and nephew, and on the side filling in for Alex's plant caretaker. One day while she's watering the plants, Alex hears her making up words to the song he's playing and decides she'd make a fantastic lyricist. Sophie is, of course, self-deprecating and claims not to have any talent. When Alex googles her he learns that she used to write poetry and prose and he becomes even more determined to have her collaborate with him on the song that will bring him back from a life defined by performing for middle-aged married women.

Music and Lyrics is about the way that Alex and Sophie work together to create a song for Cora's album. As expected, somewhere along the way, they fall in love. For Sophie, the best parts of the movie come with her self-deprecating sense of humor and refusal to admit she has any talent while at the same time praising a man who is still riding a 20-year-old wave of fame. When we learn the reason Sophie's so hard on herself (someone she admired basically told her she had no talent or future as a writer), you almost feel bad for her, but then pretty quickly I wanted her to grow up, move on, and prove him wrong. For Alex, without a doubt, the best parts of the film are the 80's flashbacks and his offer to perform on a show called ""Battle of the 80's Has Beens"" with such well known players as Flock of Seagulls, Tiffany, and Debbie Gibson. When he throws out his hip doing his signature ""Pop!"" move, it's hilarious.

Music and Lyrics is a typical romantic comedy, but it was funny and I had a good time so I can't really complain about it. I didn't expect it to be exceptional in any way, but I was entertained the whole way through and that's what's most important. With the combination of the new wave of pop music that Alex can't quite navigate (he seems more intrigued than impressed with Cora's belly-dancing moves and skimpy costumes), and Sophie's complete lack of knowledge about the music business, there's a good foundation for one of those cute date movies about the unlikely couple, and in that sense it was a successful film. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who doesn't enjoy cheesy romantic comedies, but I would for anyone who is in the mood for a fun, light-hearted film with a few quick laughs and a nice story.",1172880000,5,3192,4.528596187175044

Drew Barrymore & Hugh Grant are so likeable and they have great onscreen chemistry. Their uncanny timing in delivery of their goofy and self-depreciating selves is seamless that it makes this two-dimensional movie larger than sums of its parts.  The story premise is very simple, a had-been 80's pop singer akin to Duran Duran is desperate to write a hit song for the modern day Britney Spears &/or Christina Aguilera. That would enable him to resurrect his singing career which at best is doing circuits at amusement parks and reunion parties.  He's good with melody but without his former member who's good with lyrics, he wouldn't be able to fulfill his aim.

The story is light and airy:  Fletcher needs help writing a song for a Britney clone, Cora. A song that could maybe bring him back to prominence after twenty years of playing store openings, amusement parks and nostalgia concerts. Sophie, though a partner with her sister in a Weight Loss clinic, is a whiz at writing pop lyrics: presto...match made in heaven!
The interplay between Barrymore and Grant is spot on and the dialogue and story are almost up to their excellent timing but they both work hard, though not too as that would negate the comedy, to make this work and in most scenes it does.

1580636,3,B00005JPE3,"Sweet, clever, agenda-free, clean and relatively short. That's my formula for a decent romantic comedy.

A great one like ""Annie Hall"" needs something more, but for ""Music and Lyrics,"" the new Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore vehicle, it'll do.

A harmless ribbing of the music business and celebrity culture, the movie opens with a 1980s-era MTV video for a boy band named POP!, of which Alex Fletcher (Grant) was a singer/keyboard player. The group disbanded decades ago.

Now, Alex bangs around the amusement park and state fair circuit, riling up the Mommy & Me set. He's one canceled show away from a warm seat on ""Hollywood Squares"" when he gets an offer to write a song for teen pop star Cora (Haley Bennett).

The random, utterly stupid catch: He only has three days.

Enter Sophie (Barrymore), a former New School literature major who waters Alex's plants.

Cue the cute stuff.

It's a traditional buffet of dumb yuks from writer-director Marc Lawrence, but Grant and Barrymore deliver it with style and good cheer.

At this point, Grant is so smooth that his performance is more personality than character; he jokes and stutters and panics to a beat that's not in the script. In ""Music and Lyrics,"" Alex isn't much of a cad - just an insecure washup in tight pants.

Barrymore is like the dependable role player who's first off the bench. She's not Reese Witherspoon, Naomi Watts or Kate Winslet. She can't move cinematic earth with a look or a smile. But she's sunny and dopey and excellent at welling up with tears. She's, you know, normal, only with more dimples and modern flower power.

And Barrymore and Grant make a good pair. One scene that involves Sophie's former literature professor/lover (a nice cameo from Campbell Scott) is especially funny. It's a mix of slapstick and timing that ends with Alex moaning, ""My face is in butter."" Literally.

There are enough of those moments to patch over a listless Brad Garrett as Alex's manager and the subplot that involves Cora and a weird Madonna/Jewel type with a nest of hair.

""Music and Lyrics"" is forgettable but huggable. There are better ways to spend the last Friday night in February. But there are worse ones, too.",1172188800,,2182,4.8203753351206435
1580637,2,B00005JPE3,"Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore have pretty much made their careers from playing star-crossed lovers in a series of romantic comedies and dramas, so ""Music and Lyrics"" would seem inevitable and finally restores this cosmic balance, bringing them together. Finally.

Grant and Barrymore each have their own `shtick'; Grant's characters usually make quick self-deprecating remarks providing humor to liven up the proceedings and Barrymore's characters are usually more than a little manic, allowing her to be slightly off-putting to her potential mates until they learn she is really just a loveable goof. And each of these actors sticks close to their playbooks throughout this new romantic comedy, yet ""Music"" doesn't provide the lyrics necessary for a hit.

The idea behind ""Music and Lyrics"" is; Cora (Hayley Bennett), a Britney Spears-like pop princess, is a fan of Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant), the Andrew Ridgely-like member of a popular 80's pop group named Pop (think ""Wham""). Now washed up and counting on upcoming appearances at Knott's Berry Farm and high school reunions to pay for his big New York apartment, he quickly agrees to write a song for the pop princess and sing it as a duet with her for her new album. Only one problem; he doesn't write lyrics, he writes the music. As he works with a lyricist provided by his agent (Brad Garrett), the new plant lady, Sophie (Drew Barrymore) arrives to water the plants. As the two men work on the song, Sophie starts making up her own lyrics, prompting Alex to ask her to help him. As they are on a tight deadline, they spend a lot of time together and grow closer, providing the music and lyrics for a new song that may become a hit.

""Music and Lyrics"", written and directed by Marc Lawrence (""Two Weeks Notice"", ""Miss Congeniality"", enough said), uses a promising enough hook to bring the two actors together, but both actors have done better, so much better in other projects, this film is a let down.

The film starts promisingly, showing a music video Pop made in the mid 80s. The music video captures the look and feel of this era to a T, showing Alex (Grant) and Colin Thompson (Scott Porter) prancing around a sound stage with their band mechanically copying their moves. After this, we learn that Fletcher and Thompson parted ways in 1991, with Thompson moving on to a successful solo and movie career. Fletcher has struggled, so much so that he is now seriously considering participating in a reality show called ""Battle of the 80s Has Beens"". His agent arrives at his big New York apartment and tells him he has received a request from the reigning pop princess, Cora. She is a fan of Fletcher's and wants him to write a song for her new album, the only problem is the song needs to be completed by Friday.

So, let's stop here for a moment. Every great fairy tale and fantasy has at least some basis in reality. And a good romantic comedy is at least a few parts fantasy. So, ""Music and Lyrics"" should have some basis in reality, right? If Alex Fletcher has struggled for so many years, playing at Knott's Berry Farm and high school reunions, how has he managed to hold on to his big New York apartment, complete with grand piano and balcony? You may immediately assume that he is living off the money he made during his days of excess, in the 80s, but no, the film banishes that possibility with a quick remark from Fletcher.

From the moment Sophie enters his life, she is a whirlwind of words and movement. She nervously goes about watering the plants, talking, etc. Barrymore should really trademark this type of role, because she has played it so often. The idea s that she is initially so oft-putting to any potential mate, making it all the more cute when they realize she has potential and they fall in love. This also provides the ""Meet Cute"" moment which is required of any romantic comedy. See, she is filling in for the normal person who takes care of his plants. Her whirlwind of activity immediately draws Fletcher's eye as he regards her curiously.

When Alex realizes she can write lyrics, he asks her to help out and since they have very little time to compose the song, they have to spend a lot of time together, in his apartment. During this time, a romance blooms. Presumably. Both actors work very hard to create a spark, but nothing happens, the romance never appears.

After they finish the song, they present it to the pop princess, who will sing it at Madison Square Garden, the opening night of her new tour. This is the second part of the film that is pretty amusing, also because it is so dead on. Hayley Bennett does a great job of portraying, or maybe channeling is the right word, the spirit of Spears and all other pop princesses. Having recently found `religion', her new tour is designed around a large Buddha on the stage. Of course, this doesn't prevent her from wearing skimpy costumes and prancing around in sexually suggestive ways. She is also fond of spouting sayings she has recently learned, getting the meaning of the words completely wrong. Remember the old saying ""A Little Education  is a Dangerous Thing""? That is certainly true of Cora.

When she initially sings the new song by Alex and Sophie, she has given it a twist, making it more like all of her songs. Again, a nice touch. Cora is part of a large machine and if she does something different, the cogs in that machine will not get greased and everything will break down.

Inexplicably, she changes her mind and she and Alex perform a duet during her concert. It is pretty hard to believe that Cora's core audience would be able to sit still through this ballad, but the filmmaker needs it as a way to tie up the story.

Grant has done some funny, truly memorable films and he has done some bad, equally hard to forget films. The key to a good Grant performance is he is given a different character, with the self-deprecating remarks kept to a minimum. If he is allowed free reign, he starts to resemble a stand up comic going through his routine on stage. When his character has a harder edge (""About A Boy""), more complexity (""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), or is part of a larger ensemble cast (""Love Actually""), he is much ore successful. When he is center stage, playing the Hugh Grant character, the films usually seem hollow.

Drew Barrymore has also played her character more than a few times. As with Grant, writer / director Lawrence doesn't give her a lot of unique personality. He seems content to let the two popular actors play themselves. Barrymore was so good in ""Fever Pitch"" and the characters are very similar. The difference is in ""Pitch"", she had more of a backbone. She wasn't content to let Jimmy Fallon's character ignore her. In ""Lyrics"", she pretty much follows Grant around like a little puppy dog. Even when the relationship is having trouble, she marshals along only mildly concerned.

What ""Music and Lyrics"" proves is that popular actors should not rely solely on their patented schtick. They should look for strong directors who are willing to add something new to their characters, take them in new directions. When this happens, we have a treat waiting for us on the big screen.

When it doesn't happen, we have ""Music and Lyrics.""",1172188800,4,7238,4.665882352941177
1580638,5,B00005JPE3,"Since I complained that neither my wife nor I were reduced to tears by the end game of ""Catch and Release,"" our previous romantic comedy, I can tell you right off the bat that we both cried at the appropriate moment in ""Music and Lyrics,"" which is reason enough to round up on this early 2007 film.  But writer-director Marc Lawrence (who scripted both of the ""Miss Congeniality"" movies) knows that the climax of a good romantic comedy requires a grand gesture of love.  We know this not only because he provides one, but also because he sets it up by having a character point out the way you know when somebody is the one for you is when they do something that illustrates passion.

You have to think that Hugh Grant's funny dance through 10 Downing Street in ""Love Actually"" was an implicit audition for his role here as Alex Fletcher, the keyboard player and composer from the 70's hit group Pop, and if you are looking for a parallel in real world music history I would say think Andrew Ridgeley after George Michaels went solo and you are in the ballpark.  We are introduced to Pop at the height of their popularity and the music video of their signature song ""Pop Goes My Heart,"" where Alex and his Colin Thompson (Scott Porter) cavort in post-disco glam pop style.  But that was then and now Alex is being courted for an episode of ""Battle of the 70's Has-Beens,"" while Colin is a successful solo act (another reason I round up on this movie is that it refrains from Alex ever meeting Colin, which is a tired cliche in such films).  Then Alex has a meet with Cora Corman (Haley Bennett), the pop diva of the moment, who wants him to write a new duet and do it by the end of the week.  However, Alex does music but not lyrics, as evidenced by his unsuccessful solo album and has not bothered to find another lyricist to work with since Colin broke up the band.

Alex's agent, Chris Riley (Brad Garrett), finds a lyricist but clearly it is not going to work.  The day is saved by the serendipity that Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), who is substituting for the usual person who comes in and waters his plants, is apparently a natural lyricist.  All that have to do is write a hit song by Friday and not fall for each other in the process.  Of course they will get things half right, which is exactly how we want things to play out.  Fortunately the songs by both Lawrence and songwriter Adam Schlesinger make it easy to believe Sophie and Alex could write beautiful music together.  This will bring us to the inevitable bump in the road when Sophie discovers that the commercial aspects of songwriting are not as much fun as the creative aspects.  Sophie has here own more recent past in that her last boy friend, Sloan Cates (Campbell Scott), was inspired by her to make Sophie the title character of a best selling novel that has made him rich and famous while leaving her with a scarred psyche and a fragile ego.

As always Barrymore is cute and sweet, continuing to establish herself as the queen of current romantic comedy even when her co-star is not Adam Sandler (who would have thought they would be the best romantic couple of the decade?).  She also plays it straight while Grant, who not only can sing to go along with the aforementioned dancing, but also gets most of the laughs with his sense of self-parody and superb comic timing, which reminds me to point out that another reason for rounding up on ""Music and Lyrics"" is that this movie made us laugh out loud (intentionally, no less), than any film we have seen in the last year.  I also like that twice I was convinced that Alex was about to sing a song that he had written setting Sophie's college poems to music, but both times I was wrong and both times Lawrence (despite spelling his name funny) came up with something better (not to mention a nice homage to ""Singing in the Rain"").  There are just so many things working for ""Music and Lyrics"" that the rough spots here and there fade into insignificance by the time the final credits roll.  Speaking of which, be sure to watch the first half of the end credits where we get to watch the film's opening music video again, but this time given the ""pop up"" treatment that provides the film's final gaggle of gags.",1171843200,11,4239,4.460543337645537
7941967,5,B00005JPE3,"Ok, it's not a classic but it's a nice, gentle rom-com movie to relieve the stress of life.  Hugh Grant brushes off his dance moves (I should say ""move"") from Love, Actually--it's seriously the same dance move which is part of its charm!  The movie spoofs the old VH-1 ""Where are they now?"" and Pop up Videos.  It seems to be an homage to former teen idols like Andrew Ridgeley who become forgotten while one band member becomes famous.  Hugh Grant's has-been is spot-on--- playing any humiliating gig to stay relevant (hotel bars, class reunions, third rate amusement parks).  He jumps at the chance to write a song for a rising pop singer but he really has always been a music writer and not a lyricist which leads to his collaboration with Drew Barrymore's character.  It's predictable, but sometimes a predictable, charming, rom-com is what you need.",1526515200,,854,4.775510204081633

7941970,5,B00005JPE3,"A lot of romantic comedy films and similar pictures do nothing more than wallow in cliches, putting together actors and actresses without any chemistry on screen and having them say ludicrous things. This charming film is a great antidote to all that. Talented performers Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant look totally natural together and seem to radiate out this warmth, all of the dialogue coming naturally. The plot is a satire of the music industry's most silly trends from 80s nostalgia tours to gimmick TV shows with musicians to insensitive religiously-themed performances and more. It's not only genuinely hilarious but features some seriously catchy material. The song ""Pop Goes My Heart"" is just as great as the 80s new wave classics by the likes of Duran Duran and Wham that inspired it, and viewers of this nice film are likely to be humming the tune for days and days.",1524614400,,878,4.899328859060403
