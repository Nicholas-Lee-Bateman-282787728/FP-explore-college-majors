8468226,4,B005EHNXQC,I gave it 4 stars but it could be 5. The content is very nice and my 2 1/2 year old quickly began using the phrases and words. My only disappointment is that the video portion is short...maybe 20 - 22 minutes and does not have automatic continuous play option.  So when it stops my son gets upset. While not a showstopper...just my own annoyance because I keep having to hit the play button.,1412294400,,391,4.283783783783784
