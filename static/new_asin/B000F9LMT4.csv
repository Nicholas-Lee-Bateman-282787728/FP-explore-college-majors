2555238,4,B000F9LMT4,"Arrived in excellent condition,  in the time frame promised.  Very good DVD,  not really for the beginner,  though.  DVD extras were worth the price,  bike maintenance and adjustment.",1187827200,4,183,5.357142857142857
2555239,5,B000F9LMT4,"A must for every mountain bike rider, it even comes with instructions on how to setup and do repairing on your bikes.",1179792000,3,117,4.363636363636363
2555240,5,B000F9LMT4,"The best learning/training DVD. Doesn't get any better. Tips & advices from some of the best riders out there. Covers everything, bunny hopping, cornering, jumping, riding technical sections and a lot more. It also covers bike set up and tunning. Goes hand in hand with Brian Lopes' ""Mastering Mountain Bike Skills"" book.

Truly, a must have.",1177545600,8,342,5.107142857142857

8119258,3,B000F9LMT4,"I love the video, but it only plays on my laptop. It is not formatted to play on my DVD player or on my PS3.",1346284800,,108,3.36
8119259,3,B000F9LMT4,"This video was worth the price just to learn the value of ""pre-jumping.""  I thought bunny hopping was for kids doing tricks, not for serious trail riding to avoid all sorts of problems.
Having had a downhill lesson now, it makes me wonder why they don't cover ""extending"" or ""manualling"" off of drop-offs.  This is an important technique that I don't think the video covered.
In any case, it was still informative.  Not concise, but informative.",1303776000,,445,4.828947368421052
8119260,5,B000F9LMT4,"As a road bike rider, rocks and dirt are a scarey mystery to me.  This DVD breaks down ""off road"" into 5 separate, easy to understand riding techniques.  The rider/commentators are top level racers which is both good and bad.  Their style is impressive, the courses are competion trails, but overall each technique is clearly demonstrated and the value in a race setting is made very evident.  This does not negate the value to the weekend rider.  If anything it will make the 'impossible' trails look possible.",1276732800,,511,4.827586206896552
8119261,5,B000F9LMT4,"This film might be focused on downhill mountain biking racing, but the techniques these guys go over can be applied to just about any type of mountain biking.  I've raced downhill for a few years, and this is the only video that properly walks you through the basics of bike skills.  It's hard to disagree with the advice when it's coming from world champs.  These guys have the stripes!",1265068800,3,387,4.579710144927536
8119262,1,B000F9LMT4,Bought this as a gift for my husband who is an avid mountain biker.  Most of the techniques are described very quickly by Aussies with very heavy accents.  It's impossible to understand more than a word here and there.  The techniques they demonstrate are done as a one time run through with the indecipherable expert talks you through it.  We got very little useful info from it.,1235779200,3,380,4.626865671641791
8119263,2,B000F9LMT4,I was really looking for some instruction to take my mountain biking from beginner/intermediate skills to intermediate/advanced.  This video was no help to me. They quickly covered some fairly advanced skills with very little details or discriptions before moving to the next.  To me it seemed like a group of cool guys who are awesome mountain bikers decided to throw this video together because there is nothing else out there like it.  So it seems like someone could come along and really build on this first try.  It's not something I would recommend.,1230163200,3,555,4.935483870967742
8119264,4,B000F9LMT4,"While race oriented, this DVD is a good review of all the techniques necessary to advance in the sport of mountain biking.  Watched in order the clips build on each other and show you how to do each technique.  Yet each clip is independently selectable.
There are also sections on bike building and maintainance.
This DVD is produced in England so American viewers may find some of the language unusual but understandable.
I like the video and it passes the basic test in that after watching you want to get the bike out and practice.",1219795200,3,534,4.610526315789474
8119265,2,B000F9LMT4,"I'm one of those riders who is Intermediate/Advanced... and this DVD came on both a magazine recommendation and a friends' recommendation.  I watched it.  While it's cool to see some of the things, I yawned at the end, frustrated that I could already do 95% of what was described in the video.  I was hoping to up my skills/techniques a bit, so it didn't help me there.  one thing I *was* looking for was detailed guidance on riding a long-distance manual.  That portion lasted for maybe a minute, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know.  Fortunately, I also sponsor a school-based mountian bike club, so I will be able to use this for my students in the club, but for even the Intermediate rider, I'd say you're better suited to hang out with riders a little better than you and watch and learn them.  Heck, offer to buy them a beer afterwards if they give you a ""how to"" ride... you'll make new friends, have a better time, and maybe even save a few bucks.",1209168000,,961,4.426136363636363
8119266,3,B000F9LMT4,"This DVD provides lots of material illustrating many different mountain biking activities and techniques; however, it gives very little in the way of specific instructions.  It's better for showing what's possible than for explaining how to perform the various skills.  As such, it's probably better for riders who have lots of time to experiment than for those wanting something more along the lines of a lesson.",1203638400,20,413,5.242424242424242
