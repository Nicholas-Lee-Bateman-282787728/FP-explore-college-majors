2591885,5,B000FVQLIO,"As its hard to separate the seasons, I'll be posting a generic for all. House is a doctor who has more than a few issues, but is brillant so is allowed to get away with his rude, offensive, and at times, dangerous behavior. All this makes it so that the show never has a dull moment as the viewer isn't quite sure what House will do next or if he will be stopped in time. There are a lot of great moments and even for those who aren't fans of medical shows, this is still a show that should be checked out. It is not a family show as there is crude humor, but at least the viewer is never board.",1514160000,,595,3.925619834710744

2591898,1,B000FVQLIO,Not the series fault. We just don't like it. I like quirky characters but House is just too cynical and nasty for me.,1491696000,,117,4.130434782608695
2591899,5,B000FVQLIO,"I think this is when the show really hit its stride, and long before it started to run out of ideas. The finale is probably my all time favorite episode",1489968000,,152,4.1

2591908,5,B000FVQLIO,"House was and still is a really great show. Hugh Laurie does and excellent job in really tying in the audience to his character; House is the person that everyone wishes they could be! My favorite episode in the second season has to be the last one, ""No Reason"", were House is shot by a gunman and we get to see a different side of him. All 8 seasons of the show are amazingly awesome and I highly recommend to anyone; especially to the people who haven't seen House yet to start binge watching :) Enjoy!

I don't want to look them up, I don't want to know which are actually rear issues. This and MASH is the only medical tv shows I will watch. It's a great drama, with lots of humor.

2591957,5,B000FVQLIO,HOUSE IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING,1439769600,,28,6.25
2591958,5,B000FVQLIO,"House is an entertaining show with a lot of intellectual mind games going on between the characters, particularly Gregory House.  Though house likes puzzles, the big puzzle is what's up with him and why he is so miserable.  His whole life is the medical puzzles he diagnoses.  An ex coming into the picture tells us this was not always the case for House.  It's just the right mix of intelligence, relationship, and medical drama without focusing on the gushy, fake love lives of characters like so many shows do.  I really enjoy every episode!",1439164800,,544,4.74468085106383

2592044,5,B000FVQLIO,"Without a doubt, the best medical drama ever on television, or even on film.  It skillfully combines precision and unusual diagnostic medicine with the Human Equation.  Other medical shows typically neglect the medical aspect, and focus on the soap opera love interests of the hospital staff; but House delivers Medical School level academics, along with the drama seen in only the best of literature - the unexpected, realistic, and non-linear events we all have in our lives, rather than the mundane writing of hacks who are pandering to what the TV executives think will sell the products of their advertisers.  House is tantamount to The Sopranos, in its approach and methodology, and the true swings from the gritty to anguish and from transient humor back to despair, rarely - if ever - seen in the media, yet ever present in the daily reality of life.  House makes the so-called Reality Shows look stupider and more contrived than they actually are.  House hinges somewhere between a documentary and a true masterpiece of the art of film.  This is not a must see, or a summer blockbuster, but a treasure that will reside in the archives of the consciousness of all who embrace it.",1385683200,,1187,4.851485148514851

2592047,5,B000FVQLIO,"House Season Two, 2005-06

The stories are set at the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Gregory House MD is a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the Dr. Watson to record the events. Everybody lies is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, fictional reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? There is a recurring plot. A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem and the cure.

Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctors mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year in 1994 from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was about half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count. This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses.

Each six single-sided DVD has four episodes.
Disc 1: Acceptance; Autopsy; Humpty Dumpty; TB or not TB.
Disc 2: Daddys Boy; Spin; Hunting; The Mistake.
Disc 3: Deception; Failure to Communicate; Need to Know; Distractions.
Disc 4: Skin Deep; Sex Kills; Clueless; Safe.
Disc 5: All In; Sleeping Dogs Lie; House vs. God; Euphoria - Part 1.
Disc 6: Euphoria - Part 2; Forever; Whos Your Daddy?; No Reason.",1384560000,,2279,4.706766917293233

2592070,5,B000FVQLIO,"So I finally broke down and simply acquired every episode ever made and watched them all in a couple of weeks, from the first to the last in order. Not having TV and only occasionally being near one, I had caught just a few episodes through the years. I can now say that the very long story arc of Dr. House's genius, quirks, meanness, sardonic humor and hidden vulnerabilities have made him an iconic character in TV history, and Hugh Laurie embodied him unforgettably. I particularly enjoyed all the medico-babble. How else would I learn about all those exotic diseases?

It did seem, though, that the writers started running short of ideas towards the end and made up for it by putting House through implausible situations of degradation, breakups and self-destructiveness. Not cool. The ensemble cast was also very fine, with some characters coming and going and returning and relationships shuffling like musical beds. I guess when all else fails, sex sells.

Out of curiosity, I checked out what it might cost to purchase digital copies of the full seasons online. WOW!!!! Is there any reason why it is so much more expensive? I purchased Season One for $19.99 at a local big-box store. They carry all of the show's past seasons, and almost all of them are $19.99, but no more than $29.99 apiece. So my question is, why does it cost $37.99 to purchase a digital copy from Amazon? That just seems like a rip-off to me...",1331078400,,571,4.153153153153153
2592095,5,B000FVQLIO,"What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that House, M.D. has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, House, M.D. is probably a good show."" But in fact, House, M.D. is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.

But before I say any more about House, MD., let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. House, M.D. is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.

What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.

Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.

In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)

House, M.D., if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office). This morphing into the arena of the soap opera doesn't really matter, though, for the viewer who has gone through the entire set of previous episodes in order. With no attempt to defend this shift in style, the show uses its first three seasons to genuinely establish itself as a puzzle solving, medical mystery show, with House serving as a medical Sherlock Holmes (sans the hat and the pipe, but plus the strange personality and temperament issues), and the stories are easily carried with each individual episode standing as a mental gymnastic exercise that keeps the viewer wanting more. But strewn through these episodes are myriads of strange, and often, very awkward character interactions that are left unfinished and unexplored, tantalizing us with seeming keys to unlock the mystery of House. It is perhaps inevitable that a show lasting so many years (now in its sixth season) and having such strong characters and unusual trappings would be inevitably drawn to revisit and examine such unfinished business. These ""explorations"" begin to occur more repeatedly in Season Four, and by Season Five, we see the exaggeration of much of this at the expense of series' original, focal point of medical mysteries to be resolved, which by this point in the series often take back seat to the ever growing personal dramas. But even this doesn't matter. The issues and themes explored in Season Five, while taking on the feeling of a soap opera, are still handled with great expertise and generally fascinating ways, so that we still find ourselves focused on each event, all the time still (unconsciously at times, I must admit) wishing that we can figure House out, get the mystery of House solved, and have some type of a resolution that fits our conception of the real world. By the end of Season Five, we still do not have an answer for this dilemma, and the show uses this dilemma to hold the audience's attention in a powerful manner.

The basic premise of the show is so startling unique and fascinating in its own right that the show does not need to rely on cheap ""shock"" tricks to maintain attention. It is true that there are a number of ""shocking"" events to occur through the series, and there can be no doubt that the show, being first and foremost a network based television format production, employs ""cliffhangers"" to hold the viewer through the regular commercial breaks, but it is amazing to see how the show is regularly worked into individual episodes that are artfully crafted into stories that flow, and work, from beginning to end.

Quite some time ago, I wrote a long review for The Rockford Files, a television show in the 1970's that, in my own thinking, achieved the status as being one of the best television shows ever produced. I had written my review at a time when the first Rockford Files DVD's were being released, and the opportunity to re-watch these shows reminded me again of the superior writing, the acting, and the impressive interworking of the cast which made this show, not just a cut above the average television show, but a true classic, one that could almost not be challenged in the realm of television. I still feel that way about The Rockford Files, and, truth be known, another very different show from a decade earlier, The Dick Van Dyke Show, had many of these same characteristics, all coalescing to make what eventual became in both cases a classic production. The Rockford Files and The Dick Van Dyke Show reached such pinnacles of performance that they remain examples of the very best television ever made, and even the ravages of 30 and 40 years of time have done little but solidify that achievement.

House, M.D. is, in my opinion, is likely destined for that same level of accolade. In the show, we find that same coalescing of features - a truly unique character creation, excellent writing, and a cast that works well together - that will argue for the show's inclusion in that highest level of ranking. But whether that specific claim turns out to be true or not, the fact remains that House, M.D. is one of the most fascinating, intriguing, and enjoyable shows to watch. We witness medical problems and the difficult procedure in diagnosing and treating those problems; we witness the struggles, oddities, and offensiveness (and yes, there are many parts of the show that are incredibly offensive) of a main character who remains both a genius and an enigma, an inscrutable person who is endlessly fascinating to behold; we witness a cast of actors who must earn to interact with the powerful character of House while establishing their own credibility; and finally, but not least of all, we enjoy Hugh Laurie's incredible rendition of the House character. Add these factors up, and you end up with one heck of a fascinating show. I'll say it in conclusion again, that this is one of the best television shows to have appeared in years, and Hugh Laurie is superb in his role as House. You can enjoy it even more on DVD, where there are no commercial interruptions. I rate this as five stars, but the real truth is that it is one BIG star (House) with four other stars with him. Well, make that seven or eight other stars, depending on the season you are currently watching.",1326067200,,10674,4.848135964912281

House is an arrogant, self-absorbed egomaniac who has absolutely no social skills, and no social conscience whatsoever.  He cares about no one on earth other than himself, and yet he does a wonderful service in his diagnoses of ailments that no other doctor could succeed at.  Do you remember Rain Man, which centered around a Savant who knew ONE thing and virtually nothing else?  Institutionalized because he could not possibly care for himself, yet was a mathematical genius.
Dr. House is this way with medical diagnoses; he is an absolute genius at it, and will worm his way in to your soul with his antics.  No one would possibly actually LIKE this guy, but if I ever have some mystery ailment, I would want someone this good to work on my case.

The perephrial characters actually make the show.  They are likeable, and are such a sharp contrast to the central figure of House.

2592115,5,B000FVQLIO,"What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that ""House, M.D."" has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, ""House, M.D."" is probably a good show."" But in fact, ""House, M.D."" is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.

But before I say any more about ""House, M.D.,"" let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. ""House, M.D."" is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.

What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.

Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.

In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)

""House, M.D.,"" if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office).

2592119,5,B000FVQLIO,"...and I might add medical comedy too. Part of House's appeal is that nobody since Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry is this tough, is such a professional purist who is allowed to continue practicing that profession for more than ten minutes, and last but not least has such funny one liner remarks.

House is rude to his patients and avoids them whenever possible, but part of what makes him repugnant to almost everyone around him is that he is about the search for pure truth, and superficial niceties have no place in his life. He doesn't wear a lab coat, and he sports tennis shoes and a scruffy beard. Thus when he does actually talk to the patients he lays it on the line and expects them to do the same. However, they almost always lie to him, something that he says he expects and one reason he avoids contact with them in the first place.

So why would such a rude unkempt character be so popular among viewers? Possibly it could be because as a nation we are sick of being lied to in every aspect of our lives by blow-dried poll-tested representatives of large corporate interests who are only interested in image, profit, and covering their backsides, and House is the antithesis of all of this.

This particular season has some superb episodes. Several said they did not care for the arc with House's ex-girlfriend Stacy Warner, now married to a man with all of the s ex appeal of the Staypuffed Marshmallow Man, and who is still unable to walk while recovering from an illness that House treated him for at the end of season one. I personally liked the arc because it showed the side of House that was capable of love. Stacy has already made the admission to House that he was ""the one guy"" for her, but that there was no room in House's life for her and there was room for her in her husband's life. This sets up the possibility that House and Stacy may reunite. First, however, House has to find out the absolute truth of Stacy's relationship with her husband - and what House does to get that information costs him dearly when Stacy finds out. House does make a new friend this season - a rat living in Stacy's attic whom he names ""Steve McQueen"".

As for the individual cases, they are interesting as always, but there are three episodes that really stand out. Two of them consist of the two-parter ""Euphoria"" in which Foreman is infected with a deadly disease that is of unknown origin and an unknown method of transmission. It turns out that Foreman, who is the most similar to House of any of his assistants, is different from House in one key way. He is willing to use any means necessary to preserve his life regardless of the possible future quality of that life. The final episode has House being shot by a disgruntled ex-patient. The big question left unanswered here is not so much will he survive, but will he be able to recover the use of his leg as a result of the shooting. You see, for Foreman the important issue is just staying alive, because he has no first-hand knowledge of life with chronic disability. House has been dragging around a useless but painful leg for five years now, and when the chips are down, for him just being alive isn't enough.

The acting, the setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues, and the music, which are just wonderful! It is indeed a rarity when an amazing series such as this comes by.
In short, House, M.D. is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1235520000,,1284,5.173076923076923

2592135,5,B000FVQLIO,"Dr. House is back for round 2 and hasn't lost any of the punch!  Hugh Laurie, Robert Sean Leonard, Jesse Spencer, Omar Epps, Jennifer Morrison, and Lisa Edelstein reprise their memorable roles in Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital for more medical mysteries and interhospital relational issues.
A great concern for any sequel or season 2 is ""Can they pull off the success of the first movie/season?""  The answer for House is a big, confident ""YES!""  The addition of Stacy, House's ex-girlfriend, adds a unique dimension to the hospital, one that I thought wouldn't work.  Through Stacy (and House's pursuance of his now-married former girlfriend), we are able to see that House truly can love, does love, wants to love, but is afraid of love.  The scenes with House and Stacy are well done, vibrant, and impactful.  Definitely no naptime here!
Other episodes (such as Euphoria and The Mistake) give us glimpses into the lives of House's team members, Drs. Cameron, Chase, and Foreman.  Through these episodes, we see their strengths, their weaknesses, their families, and why they became doctors in the first place.
If you think for one moment that the writers will pull back and get lazy and let their characters slip, think twice.  The characters are just as vibrant as in Season 1, the drama just as moving, the mysteries as puzzling and House's humor just as funny and piercing.
Again, if you have a faint stomach or are sensitive to sexuality in shows, this might not be for you...
Add the absolutely amazing season finale that will make you wonder what does and doesn't exist, and this is definitely not a season to be missed.  Add this to your Christmas list and hope Santa thinks you've been good this year!  A must have to anyone's DVD collection!

EPISODE GUIDE:

""Acceptance"" - A death row inmate develops symptoms and House jumps to take on the case.  You get to see how Cameron hates to face the facts, lives in eternal hope, and believes that everyone should make an impact in the world.  4.5/5

""Autopsy"" -  A young cancer patient is experiencing symptoms...but the team can't seem to find what is wrong.  I love how House questions this young girl's bravery and the hug.  5/5

""Humpty Dumpty"" - A young man falls of Cuddy's roof and is unable to breath.  We get to see more of Lisa's character, how guilty she feels, and how she will do anything to remedy her mistake...which may prove detrimental!  4.5/5

""TB or Not TB"" - A famous TB doctor exhibits TB symptoms, but House is sure it isn't TB.  I love seeing House irate at this man, to see Cameron think this doctor is the next best thing to Wonder Bread.  4.5/5

""Daddy's Boy"" - A recent college grad experiences shock like symptoms.  Excellent episode, with the father-son relationship of the patient giving an interesting contrast to House's relationship with his parents.  5/5

""Spin"" - A cyclist collapses while on a race...and it's drugs!  Cameron gets up in arms about his lying to his fans, about his drug usage.  4.5/5

There are almost as many hospital dramas as there are seasons of Law and Order, but House manages to stay fresh, different, and overall so compelling that grown adults like myself and far more grown adults like my mother have lost sleep to the series. Compelling and griping, whereas season 1 was focused on the puzzle that was House, season 2 provides us more of his background, his ""love"" life, and what made him into the person he is after six years with his leg. Coupled with the dramatic season finale, there is no way anyone who has even seen half an episode of House shouldn't get this series right away, unless it is to purchase season 1 first.",1224115200,,876,4.544303797468355
2592141,5,B000FVQLIO,"House M.D. - Season 2
Recently I watched the complete first season of House M.D.; I thought it was a perfect show. House was gripping, entertaining, and a complete jerk. I loved him. Season 2 takes this show to an entirely new level though. House is established within the first few episodes for those who have not seen the initial season. After this, the series begins to build more characters that are dynamic. As if House was not enough, they now develop the personality of his team of doctors. Chase, Foreman, and Carmen all go through character cycles that build on you.

House is a painkiller-addicted doctor who walks with a limp due to a muscle being removed in his leg. He is the best doctor in the hospital, but is often apathetic and hates patients. The storyline of a common episode will depict House and his team trying to find out what is wrong with an abnormal patient. They will come up with a solution and find out it is wrong. Then they continue to find solutions until they find the right one. Along the way, there is plenty of gore and snide remarks on behalf of House. Almost every episode has this underlying pattern.

The episodes often break off into side plots, which actually become the main plot. This creates multiple captivating plots. Character development branches off these side plots. At the end of the Season, you feel like you know each character. You do not just know there character, but you know their ideals and personality given any situation.

Foreman changes his character drastically about four times. Each time is progressive and makes perfect sense though. Not only does is dialogue change, but his appearance changes. Foreman came off as my favorite character in Season 2. I am not one for being a crybaby, but Foreman gave a heart-wrenching performance in a few episodes.

This Season of House M.D. is better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B0009WPM1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>. I advise picking up both though. Each episode is great in its own way. The Season finale will have you so far on the edge of your seat that you will be on the floor. Buy this 6-disk set today or you are an idiot.",1222041600,,2216,4.9171122994652405
2592142,5,B000FVQLIO,"After the triumphant debut of the first season of House, many people believed it couldn't be topped. How wrong they were. Season Two not only shut up all the skeptics, it slapped them for even being doubtful. Season Two not only had the absence of the annoying character of Vogler, it gave us a deeper insight into all the characters. At the end of Season One we were introduced to House's ex Stacy. During Season Two we're given a more complex look on their past and their true relationship. The Stacy/House episodes introduce to the fans a deeper complexity to House and we see a more genuine side, rather than the typically cynical House we're used to.

There is one episode which I found a bit too much and felt it was pushing to be controversial. I know it still had a point and didn't fail to entertain and give some deep meaningful message that some will miss somewhere. I'm not going to tell you the episode as you will all know it when you see it. This season also features two very tough to deal with episodes as Foreman is taken down by a life threatening disease, that even House struggles to solve.

As always the show is filled with excellent quotes by House and the team. Below are some of my picks.

From Episode 1: Acceptance:

Foreman: ""Aren't there better ways to spend our time?""

House: ""Good question. What makes a person deserving? Is a man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a man who kills his wife?""

Foreman: ""Uh yeah. Actually, he is.""

House: ""What about a child molester? Certainly not a good guy, but he didn't kill anybody. Maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs. What about you? What medical care should you be denied for being a car thief? Tell you what: the three of you work out a list of what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed. I'll review it when I get back.""

From Episode 5: Daddys Boy:

House: ""Gimme a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumor about you being a transsexual.""

Cuddy: ""There is no such rumor.""

House: ""There will be unless you get me out of this dinner.""

From Episode 24: No Reason:

House: ""Here's how life works: you either get to ask for an apology or you get to shoot people. Not both.""",1217808000,,2220,4.398533007334963
2592143,5,B000FVQLIO,"House rocks!  I rarely watch TV, but stumbled upon the show one boring evening looking for something to do.

I am a teacher who has also had to go against the grain to fight for what is right for my students.",1216166400,,387,4.333333333333333
2592144,5,B000FVQLIO,"This season was as innovative and captivating as the first season.  All the episodes had a unique and new disease, some of which being devastating some being comical.

2592150,5,B000FVQLIO,"They said Hugh Laurie nailed this character in his screen test, and they were right (he wouldn't have landed it with his own English accent!). House is a good-looking yet selfish and demanding guy who has only one redeeming quality: he saves people's lives. The writing and research for the show are incredibly well done as is the acting by all involved. It's also great to see Robert Sean Leonard in a role that spans the widest range of acting abilities, from playing the tender, straight-and-narrow guy to the naive schmuck seemingly starved for House's friendship and becoming the butt of House's ""practical jokes"". Here's hoping for a long run! ~ Natasha",1207353600,,659,4.892857142857143
2592151,5,B000FVQLIO,"I first saw House because I've been a fan of Hugh Laurie since ""Blackadder"" and ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"", and I wanted to see how he'd do in a role that's obviously so far from the characters that made him famous (in Britain at least). I must admit that I had not the slightest inkling of a fraction of an idea, that ""House, M.D"" would turn out to be this brilliant.

Because that is what it is: Brilliant. Laurie plays the calculating, narcissistic, and effulgent dr. Gregory House to perfection. It is however not a one-man show and Laurie's co-stars all do a very good job playing his subordinates, friend(s), and colleagues, but especially Lisa Edelstein as House's boss Lisa Cuddy is worth of much applause.

The stories are interesting and fascinating, very well written, and well played. There's just enough medical jargon to make it seem expertly confusing and realistic, yet not boring the viewer to tears. The same goes for the humour and the quick witted banter that makes out most of the dialogue. It's humorous but not comedic, it's quick but not 'this was obviously written to show how fast and witty these people are'.

It is probably the best TV series for 10 or 15 years, and I honestly think it's going to be a while before anything better comes along. Series two only proves that ""House, M.D."" really is a winning formula. The pace is still up there, and as we learn more about the players involved, the clot, if you'll allow a little word play, thickens. It is, in a couple of words, still good.",1207094400,,1516,4.545787545787546

House M.D is a medical Drama that starts British actor Hugh Laurie as Gregory House. Not only does the fill the role greatly, I doubt any other actor could have the same charm he does.

Now season one of House was great and really got the show running. Season carries that over, but is lacking at some points. While watching some episodes it seems that things drag on for too long and are interesting at all. The last episode of this season in my opinion is a great example. It starts off great, but in time it just gets boring. Luckily this is rare. This boxset is still worth paying even the full value of $60. Even if you are just getting into the series this is still a great buy or gift for a friend.

2592157,5,B000FVQLIO,"""House"" is a perfect television show, and is, in my opinion, the only dramatic show currently in production that's worth watching. The show, centered on the acerbic, thoroughly disagreeable, and utterly brilliant Dr. Gregory House, is well written, intelligently directed, and perfectly acted. Hugh Laurie as House deservedly gets the lion's share of the plaudits for the show, but the remaining cast is equally brilliant in their vital supporting roles. Omar Epps, Jennifer Morrison, and Jesse Spencer deserve special mention for playing the young and impressionable doctors putting up with House's eccentricities, but my favorite of the supporting cast is Robert Sean Leonard as oncologist Dr. James Wilson. Leonard's portrayal is both funny and poignant, as are the lines crafted for him by the excellent screenwriters.

There are several plotlines in this season, most significantly the reappearance of ex-girlfriend Stacy, played by Sela Ward, in House's life. If I had only one thing to change about season two, it would be to take a bit less time for the Stacy subplot, which, for me, was stretched beyond its usefulness. There are many excellent episodes, and many interesting guest stars including LL Cool J, Ron Livingston, Cynthia Nixon, and Michelle Trachtenberg.

The DVD set includes many extras including a ""House"" documentary, a blooper reel, and producer commentaries: I found them all enjoyable.

Prime time television simply does not get any better than this: I highly recommend this season of ""House,"" but urge you to do the sensible thing and buy all the seasons at once. Yes, they're that good.",1199404800,,1616,5.255813953488372
2592158,5,B000FVQLIO,"i love tv shows but one thing that always bothered me was the fact that many had a terrific season one and the others were only good. I'm glad that House is not the case, i loved the first season, smart and funny at the same time and i didn't thought they could do twice, but they did! great season two!
The season finale was mind-blowing, the writters are insane smart.

I have been working in this capactiy for over 3 years and never has a doctor come into my deparment to do one of the studies I am trained and paid to do. But I understand that this it T.V. so they cut corners for entertainment purposes. I truly enjoy when House has to deal with patients who come in for problems that are a result of their own idiocy. He explains to them in no uncertain terms just how stupid they are and why they have the problem they do. I frequently deal with people like this. But not being a Doctor on T.V.

Sometimes a bit more character development, but in the end: You have House doing clinic, then gets his hands on an ""interesting case"" spends the whole episode trying to figure it out with the whole team, and finally House has an epifany that allows him to solve the case... nice ""Sherlock Holmes"" style, but I think it could use more variety... something unexpected from time to time.",1197072000,,660,4.721739130434782

2592176,5,B000FVQLIO,"Even those who hate Dr. Gregory House are forced to admit it -- the man is brilliant. Relying on his unconventional methods and the three fellows under his tutelage, House (Hugh Laurie) regularly cracks difficult cases that other doctors would have given up long ago.

Ironically enough, the one patient House couldn't save is himself. Seven years ago, he suffered an infarction in his thigh, undergoing a dangerous surgery in an attempt to save his life. While House did survive, he was left with constant pain -- causing him to pop Vicodin like candy, walk with a serious limp, and become filled with even more bitterness than he began with.

It was largely because of this that House broke up with his longtime, live-in girlfriend, attorney Stacy Warner (Sela Ward). Since that time, she's married someone else and moved on. House claims he has, too, although his behavior indicates otherwise.

Added to that, House is antisocial and always thinks outside the box; as one of his fellows once said, ""He doesn't even know where the box is."" Introspective and much too frank, House is a loner, except for the friendship of Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), a young oncologist who also works at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, and their boss, dean of medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein).

Despite the verbal abuse and eccentricity that House brings, his three fellows -- Drs. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) all know that he's one of the best there is, and working with him for a few years will guarantee them their choice of jobs once they're ready to work unsupervised.

Season 2 includes many guest appearances by Sela Ward as House's ex Stacy, who is hired as a hospital attorney -- causing much friction and longing between the two. There's more about Foreman's, Chase's and Cameron's backgrounds; as well as flashbacks of House's infarction. Foreman catches a deadly disease from a Patient of the Week, and the season's cliffhanger leaves House shot by a disgruntled patient.

Season 2 also includes a number of extras, including bloopers and interviews, which are sure to please any fan.",1182988800,,2175,5.011080332409972

2592179,5,B000FVQLIO,"Mea culpa. I'll admit it. I happened upon House mid-second season. Little did I know within a year I'd be hooked, desperate for my weekly fix of the wickedly attractive yet insanely abrupt!

Who needs mind-altering drugs when the creative symbiosis of David Shore/Bryan Singer/Katie Jacobs and the rest of their mojo-magic crew sets lovably perverse genius Hugh Laurie loose opposite affably earnest Robert Sean Leonard to do what only they can do?

Um, taut innuendos, anyone? Unlike some TV actors who can't even eat a sandwich sans cue cards, the talented duo's bickering camaraderie scarfs up the subtext of both female and male dreams. House/Wilson is Greek theater being played out by the American Medical Association's Monty Python Repertory company atop a world stage while perched precariously upon a high wire. With no net, yet. Bravo.

Even though Fox reruns their reruns and USA, too, it's looking like a long, hot, steamy summer until The Boys & Co. are back in town.

Wheww[...]

Until then, I am happy to write The House Blogs! AND House-sit Seasons 1 and 2, for there is a there that is destination worthy until the arrival of the medical narrative's Season 3 on DVD, due out in late August. For in a spectacle to savor when last we saw the low GQ-high IQ Dr. Gregory House, he was running his long lithe fingertips oh-so-gently about the sleek glossy curves of his new musically acoustic lover, virtually about to pluck her into ecstasy, and therein lies my other ""problem"" with this unquestionably brilliant show:

2592191,5,B000FVQLIO,"On a personal opinion, this is one of the best shows on television today. It is somewhat like a parallel to a medical version of 'West Wing', although Greg House is not the president of medicine.  The ensemble of weekly characters do nothing but contribute to the quality of the show.  It encompasses drama, humor, and medical quandrys that even Perry Mason wouldn't be able to solve. House is an irreverant medical genius who leads a small team of clinical diagnosticians on a weekly crusade of solving the priority issues in a New Jersey teaching hospital.  As much as they try, House ends up always being right.  And in being right, House usually conveys his element of humorous sarcasm, wit and cynical correction of their misdiagnosis.

2592194,5,B000FVQLIO,"Whose house...Greg's house! It is so easy to become addicted to this intense, character driven dramedy that showcases the amazing acting talent of this ensemble cast, led by the illustrious Hugh Laurie in the title role as Dr. Gregory House.

Follow Dr. House as he and his team of diagnosticians work round the clock to solve bizarre medical mysteries. Each episode brings a new and exciting medical challenge for our favorite TV docs to puzzle through. After suffering muscle death in his right leg, House experiences chronic pain (for which he regularly pops the narcotic painkiller Vicodin like they were tic-tacs), and manages to get around using a cane (which has become one of his trade-mark accessories). His constant pain, plus many other mitigating factors, make House a sarcastic, cranky, angry-with-the-world kind of man. Unfortunately for those who have to withstand his nasty demeanor, House is also a brilliant diagnostician, and an astute observor of human behavior (even going so far as to recommend to a patient whose skin has turned orange that he stop eating so many carrots, and get a good lawyer. When the patient asked why he'd need a lawyer, House unapolegetically told the man that if his wife hasn't noticed that her husband has turned a radioactive shade of orange, she's probably cheating on him and therefore distracted).

Hugh Laurie's comedic turn as the cranky Dr. House is pure genius. He is the major reason this show has taken off as it has. Laurie snagged the role by filming an audition tape with a hand-held camera in a tiny, dirty bathroom. Laurie was filming on location for his movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-the-Phoenix-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0007KIFI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;when he heard about the role. Not wanting to miss out, he filmed an audition tape, and mailed it to the show's creators.

If you don't already own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D-Season-One/dp/B0009WPM1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D. - Season One</a>, purchase it immediately, along with this incredible season 2 set. As far as the asthetics of the set itself, I find that I like the way Season 2 is set up. Season 1 contained three discs, the type that have two sides to them so that when you are ready to watch the rest of the episodes you just flip the disc over. Season 2 contains six individual discs, three of which offer some pretty fun special features.

Included in the special features are a couple alternate scenes in which Dr. Cuddy and Dr. Cameron do the same dialogue in a bubbly California valley girl dialect (it's pretty funny). There is also a compilation from all the episodes in which the doctors are doing their ""differential diagnosis"" and the auto-immune disease Lupus is thrown out as a suggestion (if you pay attention, you'll notice that the term Lupus is used often, even though there has yet to be a single episode where Lupus was the correct diagnosis). My favorite special feature would be the montage of the many goof-ups, slip-of-the-tongues, forgotten lines, made-up lines (often perpetrated by Hugh Laurie), and just general hilarity.

Bottom line, while House's mantra is ""everybody lies"", it's no lie that this show is amazing, and well worth the purchase of the season box sets.

""House"" airs on FOX on Tuesdays at 8:00 Central/Standard.",1177027200,,3470,5.3812154696132595

Perhaps it's just my case, but I've opened it three or four times now to find two or more of the discs out of place.  And the special features are on separate discs.  Otherwise, very happy!

2592198,5,B000FVQLIO,"It's good, it's great, it's wonderful! House MD is probably, hands down, the best drama on TV this time around. It's certainly a heck of a lot better than Grey's Anatomy or Scrubs (Don't even get me started on that show...)! Hugh Laurie, playing Doctor Gregory House, is a phenomenal actor, not just in dramas like House MD but in his own British comedy bits as well (See: A Bit Of Fry and Laurie).

Yes, he's British. I know, he doesn't have an accent in the show. Cool, huh? That just goes to show you how talented he is!

I never knew a man could look better with stubble than clean-shaven, but those big baby-blue eyes and tan skin just doesn't look right perfectly shaven. He is a terribly gorgeous man.

House's sarcasm and wit will keep you watching, smiling, even laughing. He's charming and attractive... who could ask for more?

There are other handsome actors on this show as well, besides Laurie. Jesse Spencer, a beautiful, blond Australian actor, plays Doctor Robert Chase, a young blossoming doctor who is certainly not a character with too much backbone when it comes to standing up to House. However, being that House is right so often, he doesn't really have to stand up to him.

Robert Sean Leonard (who you may remember from the extraordinary movie Dead Poet's Society) plays Doctor James Wilson, House's best friend. He is certainly a charming character and actor as well. He is House's check and balance, because in everything House does, he is always questioning it and trying to bring in another perspective. He is a very human character, though, and for all his moral ruminations, we still see his flaws... he is a bit of a Don Juan. House, who seems to have a huge problem with cheating, is always questioning him regarding his faithfulness to his wife, and that certainly does help as so much of modern entertainment doesn't put much stock in the sanctity of a marital relationship.

Well, this is getting really long, isn't it? I guess going character-by-character isn't working too well.

Alright. It's a great show, and the characters are, mostly, really great too. This is certainly worth every penny, so what are you still sitting here reading this for? Go buy it!",1174608000,,2196,4.718015665796345

Hugh Laurie has developed a character that is, on the surface, gruff and nasty, but shows that he cares deeply for his patients with simple glances and expressions.  He treats his staff like a Marine Drill Instructor.  Again shuffling his care and nastiness like a juggler.

2592201,5,B000FVQLIO,"House M.D. returns after a successful first season, and this time there's more suspense, more humor, more bizarre medical cases, and more romantic involvements. Along with Laurie, Epps, Sean Leonard, Edelstein, Morrison, and Spencer comes Sela Ward (who also appeared in the last two episodes of Season One). She plays House's former love who starts to question her own desires while living happily with her present husband Mark. Also, throughout this season, Doctor House tries to find more ways to deal with not only the pain in his leg, but also the pain in his heart. And the results and consequences will shock you and make you think more critically.

All the actors and actresses (even those who play the patients and their loved ones) give out splendid performances here. And although every episode has its faults, there are still many highlights that are either delightful or horrifying.

Laurie is one of the best actors I've seen on TV or the movies and his ""House"" role proves it.

The blooper section is a nice addition, although quite short and the expletives were bleeped out, due to the PG-13 rating.

2592256,5,B000FVQLIO,"This series raises many questions, and not just about the medical conditions portrayed.  The different characters, both recurring and guest, represent different ways of looking at human nature itself.  To watch this season of House is to ponder what it is to be human.",1167696000,,268,5.068181818181818
2592257,5,B000FVQLIO,"If you're on Season 2, then you already know what makes House shine. While other hospital dramas often have sappy-sweet doctors and soap-opera interrelationships, House is amazing because of its smart, strong characters and the interactions between them. You rarely have the ""stupid administrator"" who gets in the way of everything going on for inane reasons. It usually is smart person 1 with good reasons, talking with smart person 2 with equally good reasons, trying to sort out what the best solution is. The game doesn't play down to its audience - it expects its audience to pay attention and to catch all the small details.

That's why these stories are so great to re-watch multiple times, and to see in order. You see the characters growing, subtly, and relating previous experiences to current situations. These aren't the silly person-goes-from-sour-to-super-happy sitcom style changes. They are realistic, quiet, small changes, like most real humans go through. You get the sense that these characters are organic, that they learn and grow and mature.

The dialogue is just great. I could quote hundreds of lines from House that I love, and every time I rewatch the show, they still have that power. It's the interaction of bright, well educated minds, with numerous sly allusions to Moby Dick, Shakespeare, and much more.

Like with most series, it's really great to go into this without knowing ANY of the plotlines so you can experience them fresh. At least, unlike Season 1, the DVD doesn't give plots away! That's really great. It means if you haven't seen Season 2 yet, you can use the DVD without fear of getting hints before you start each episode. Be very careful when reading other reviews, a lot of them give away key plot points. I think it's fair enough to say that episodes feature patients in danger of losing their lives, and that a few of the cast members end up at risk too.

Highly recommended, whether you've never seen this season before or whether you saw it on TV and want to re-watch the episodes. Just make sure you've seen Season 1 first, so you get all the background and basis that leads up to what is happening here.",1167177600,,2157,4.8059299191374665
2592258,5,B000FVQLIO,"First rate product.  One of the best programs to come around in years.

2592259,5,B000FVQLIO,"What makes House such a great show is all the punch lines by Hugh Laurie, and in Season 2 you get a lot of them. Not only is it a great show, but you can learn a lot from it. Season 1 was good. Season 2 was great, and Season 3 is awesome. House is up there with Lost and Prison Break as best shows on TV today. All you need to do is watch one show and you will instantly want more. Highly recommended.",1164844800,,401,3.7294117647058824

This is thought provoking, ethical stretching (I hide my face or scream at House to stop doing what he's doing) and medically challenging.  Favorite episodes? ""Autopsy"" is heartbreaking with pediatric girl and House' response. ""Daddy's Boy"" is an opening into his relationship with his parents that leaves you wanting more to reveal his damaged emotional background. ""House vs God"" has deep theological vs scientific debate which is a great spin on this controversy. ""Euphoria"" lets Omarr Epps shine - also great insight into this character's makeup. Cliffhanger ""No Reason"" was so well written with its plot twists and viewpoint - gotta get this Season to appreciate ensemble, awe of the medicine and again the charm/craziness of ""House"".",1164412800,,948,5.031847133757962

His dislike, distrust and disgust with the majority of the human race, believe it or not can be quite funny.  He says things and does things that many of us ""think"" but wouldn't dare.  Watching someone do it and get away with it (sometimes) is quite entertaining!",1163376000,,429,4.592105263157895

2592268,3,B000FVQLIO,"This was so very, very riveting in series 1, but it is becoming predictable and stagnant. Hugh Lawrie says that in his view TV lead characters stay stable while the characters around them change, and in cinema the reverse happens.

2592272,5,B000FVQLIO,"Basically, my opinion is the same as that of Season one....OUTSTANDING!!  It just keeps getting better and better.  This show is completely addicting.  Hugh Laurie is wonderful, rough and sexy as can be!  He is so down to earth, so very rough around the edges, but you can easily see he is very vulnerable underneath the rough exterior.  This is one of the many reasons his character is so very interesting and appealing.  It makes you want to keep watching to find out what it is ""exactly"" that has made him what he is.  The other characters also mesh well together, they did a great job choosing the supporting actors.  What else can I say?  GREAT SHOW!",1163030400,,655,4.52991452991453

The only reason I didn't give the set a rating of 5 is that I would have like to have seen more bonus features...more interviews, bloopers, anything to have more to enjoy.  I think compared to other DVDs, especially box sets, this one is real skimpy on the bonuses.

I know I will buy season three even if they don't come up with more goodies in the set, but I will be disappointed if they don't add more.",1163030400,,645,4.087301587301587

2592279,5,B000FVQLIO,"The second season of House is indeed a very rare televisual experience. Intelligent, witty, touching and deep, yet this brilliant series never patronises its viewer.

Using a formula similar to that of CSI, with comparisons drawn from Sherlock Holmes to Columbo, House adds character developement, suspense and a cynical wit to the mix. The eponymous character, played flawlessly by Hugh Laurie, is perfect but somehow never outshines a truely inspired supporting cast.

As with the very best TV shows, self indulgency is never far away in some episodes but so absorbing is House, you actually feel you are in on the joke and never alienated.

If you thought season one was good, this is better and like all good shows, it leaves you wanting more.

House will go down as one of the pivotal TV series of the 21st century... just buy it for goddsake!",1163030400,,848,4.827586206896552

I found Doc House fascinating and great but after a dose of 4 or 5 or 6 episodes a week he often seemed annoying. I also wish they made his crew a little more interesting. Over all very good and I will buy Season 3 next year.,1163030400,,316,3.803030303030303
2592281,5,B000FVQLIO,"Hugh Laurie is a brilliant actor, who would know he is English?  The ensemble seems like it is meant to be together.

2592283,5,B000FVQLIO,"This season is even more shocking than the first.  After viewing these discs, you can only speculate on what outrageous acts that Dr. House will do next.  Is he motivated by is leg pain, his addiction to pain meds or just for the fun of being contrary?  I think that is what makes House's character so compelling; wondering what the motivation is that makes him so intriguing and shocking.  Season three which is airing on FOX network now, does not disapoint!  If you do not know, Hugh Laurie is also a fanatasic comedy sketch actor.  Check out seasons 3 and 4 of Black Adder, A Bit of Fry and Laurie 1 & 2, and he also wrote a book.  Hugh Laurie is a great actor, he can go from silly wigs and pantaloons to a deep character with questionable ethics.  Dont miss House.",1163030400,,769,4.328671328671328

Not only that, but he's a scream.  This show is funnier than the Simpsons, albeit in a much blacker way.  The second season improves on the first by showing us some supporting character development that was lacking last year.  All in all, I have no complaints about any of the episodes, but I feel the strongest was the season-ender that had House a patient in his own hospital.  I can't recommend this show enough.

2592298,5,B000FVQLIO,"House rides again in the second series of this wonderful hospital procedural. Slightly less Sherlockian than the first series although all the elements of Holmes' ferocious intellect are there (as is the number of House's apartment -- 221b!).

The intense characterisation of the central flawed personality continues. There has been nothing this exposed on TV since the original British ""Cracker"". The writers go deep into the dark side of their character and Hugh Laurie responds brilliantly. They daringly allow their star to become almost repulsively rude and obnoxious at times while we see his pain and frustration played out against his intellectual rigour.

The crackling tension between the characters is perfectly framed by the sharp dialogue, crisp and dramatic plotting of each medical mystery, and flashes of sometimes hilarious dark humour -- usually in the clinic setting. Writing doesn't get better than this.

The overall effect is a feast of theatre which you will want to watch over and over. As with so many of the best American TV series the script is the star. But the material brings out the very best of a great squad of actors.

House is one of those series where you have a love-hate relationship with the main character... a lot like Archie Bunker, where you might think the things House says, but you would never treat people the way he does -- but you might want to!  And you end up caring about each character... especially surprising when you feel that you are just getting to hate one!  The plots are fantastically complex medical diagnosis with enough intrigue to leave you baffled at how many times a doctor can get something wrong; but still end up saving the person's life in a fashion of miraculous discovery... and Hugh Laurie is exquisite when he ""gets it""!  Amazing tension in the show is created because you know that House will eventually get it right -- saving the patient when no one else can, but he makes many wrong turns along the way... a lot like his life. This series will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat and praising the makers of VHS & DVD that you don't have to wait thru the commercial!!

All I care about is the incredible dynamics created between the central players. As for the dialogue? Man, the dialogue is beyond equal on TV today. House has throwaway lines that other shows would kill for, but there are just so many, I'm sure most viewers simply don't realise how clever it is. It really is one of the funniest shows on TV, even though it's not a comedy.

If you like watching specialists solving mysteries, you must see this. If you want an idea of what it's like, try thinking of Columbo meets Qunicy meets CSI - though House surpasses all of them.

Hugh Laurie and the script writers have done such an incredible job bringing House to life. God knows how the writers come up with all the possible diseases and cures, but it never seems a stretch to go with them. And all the while, House is there to deliver acidic lines to tantalize the viewer and keep the show crackling along.

2592309,5,B000FVQLIO,"I have never found medical dramas to be very interesting or exciting, and I am among the few people in my circle who was not swept away in the big ER craze of the mid-1990's. However, I was attracted to House MD because of British actor Hugh Laurie, who I have been a fan of since his days in Blackadder and A Bit of Fry and Laurie, and now I am firmly hooked on the show. The combination of fine acting and razor sharp writing roped me in, and now I am longing for Season 3 to come out on DVD!

The namesake of the series is Dr. Gregory House, played to dramatic and comedic perfection by Laurie. He is as eccentric as they come - sarcastic, uncaring, and totally devoid of social skills. However, he is a medical genius, and he solves with relative ease what other doctors cannot even scratch the surface of. Each show follows a standard formula - patient falls ill, original diagnosis is incorrect, patient gets worse, Dr. House and his team attempt to solve it, they guess wrong the first time, but at the end Dr. House identifies the cause of the illness and all is well. In between, we see how Dr. House and his team interact, and this is where season two stands out. If season one had a weakness, it was that the character development was limited to their daily lives in the hospital. In season two, we see more personality coming out of the main characters. We see what Dr. House is like to live with, we meet Foreman's father, and we see things get hot between Chase and Cameron. By far the most interesting scenes involve Dr. House living with his one and only friend, Dr. Wilson, who seems to value their friendship despite Dr. House's lack of tact and compassion. Equally compelling is Dr. House and his relationship with his ex, Stacey.

I bought this DVD set for the show alone, so I am not too disappointed by the lack of quality extras. There are a few alternate takes, a 6 minute blooper reel in which we see the cast blowing their lines, and a dull 20 minute chat session titled ""An Evening With House"". This consists of the producers (and some of the actors) sitting around talking about the show, with only Hugh Laurie offering the occasional insightful comment. However, the show is more than worth the price, so even without any extras, this set would be a great buy.

House MD is an excellent show across the board, most notably for Hugh Laurie's excellent performance. It combines mystery, humor, and heart, and having seen both season one and two, I can say that it keeps getting better. This is a highly recommended purchase.",1159056000,,2551,4.458244111349036
2592310,5,B000FVQLIO,I am very impressed by the music they play at the end of each episode and I like to find out more about who sings the songs.  I was not able to find out in the credits.  can you help?,1158883200,,183,3.55
2592311,5,B000FVQLIO,"The first season of ""House, M.D."" introduced us to a sardonic, pill-popping (though brilliant) doctor named Gregory House, who (along with his medical team) in each episode would take on baffling cases and tried to solve the mysterious illnesses that their patients would come down with. The medical mysteries continue with season two of ""House, M.D."", which I think is just as superb as season one. Many of the great qualities that were displayed in the first season are back in the second season: excellent writing, exceptional directing, and terrific acting by the cast.

Hugh Laurie returns in his career defining role as Dr. House, an individual who's very good at his job but not very good at being nice to anyone (including his team). Laurie is the whole show here, but he has the great support of an extremely talented supporting cast. Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy), Omar Epps (Dr. Foreman), Robert Sean Leonard (Dr. Wilson), Jennifer Morrison (Dr. Cameron), and Jesse Spencer (Dr. Chase) are all back as well, with at least one welcome addition to the cast for part of season two. Two time Emmy award winning actress Sela Ward (""Sisters"", ""Once and Again"") was introduced at the end of season one as House's ex-girlfriend Stacy Warner, who asked House to treat her husband who came down with a mysterious illness (which he eventually cured). In the final episode of season one, Dr. Cuddy wanted to hire Stacy to become the hospital lawyer, though first asking House for his permission. He agreed and in season two we get to see much of Stacy as House tries to not only deal with his patients and his incredibly sore leg, but also deal with his relationship with Stacy in spite of the fact that she's currently married. This was a terrific storyline to the show as well as intriguing, as you wonder what's going to happen between these two people. There's great chemistry between Laurie and Ward in their scenes together and the two play off each other wonderfully.

Even though Hugh Laurie is the main star of ""House, M.D."", the supporting actors got a chance to show off their acting chops in season two. Omar Epps gives a powerful performance in the two part episode titled Euphoria, in which Dr. Foreman comes down with an illness that House and his other team members frantically try to find a cure for. Jesse Spencer shines in the episode The Mistake, in which Dr. Chase comes under fire from the hospital board after making a fatal error that leads to the death of a patient. Sela Ward also does some strong acting in this same episode as Stacy tries to help Chase in telling him on what he should say at the disciplinary hearing. And Jennifer Morrison does a good job in the episode Hunting, where Dr. Cameron fears that she might have contracted AIDS after an AIDS patient that she treats accidentally coughs blood over her.

Though ""House, M.D."" is a drama series, the show has its share of funny moments as the humor level went up a few notches in season two. Most of the laughs come from the insanely things that House says to everyone, but that's not all. Some of the truly funniest moments include: House allowing Wilson to come live with him and their living arrangements start to backfire almost from the start; House, Wilson, and Cuddy enjoying a night of gambling at their hospital benefit; House catching a mouse at Stacy's place, then decides to keep it by bringing it to the hospital; and the laugh out loud moment of season two is when House breaks the news to a Chinese woman who only speaks Mandarin that her teenage daughter is pregnant. (Yes, he breaks the news to her speaking in Mandarin!)

While there are plenty of laughs on ""House, M.D."", there are also plenty of disturbing images that might be too intense for some viewers. This is especially true of the last episode of season two: No Reason. Even though the primary storyline of this episode revolves around House getting shot by the husband of a former patient and realizing that the pain in his leg is starting to go away, there's the secondary storyline that revolves around a patient with a very bad tongue infection. I must warn you, what this patient goes through is extremely tough to watch. If you haven't seen this episode yet and you're reading this now, please take my warning seriously. There are a couple of extremely graphic moments that may be too much for some people. By the end of this episode I was in shock at what I had seen. During the first two seasons, ""House, M.D."" has had its share of graphically disturbing moments. But the No Reason episode is by far the most hard to watch episode to date.

In spite of all the disturbing elements that this show puts on display, ""House, M.D."" is a terrific show. For season two, it received its first Emmy nomination as Best Drama Series. But where was Hugh Laurie's nomination for Best Actor? Everybody said that he was snubbed, and boy they were right. But I'm sure he'll be back nominated next year. On the bright side, he won a Golden Globe earlier this year for season two, which was well deserved. And if the show continues to get stronger with each season, I think some of the supporting cast members will be honored too as well as possible nods for its writing and directing which it so much deserves.

""House, M.D."" is the medical show to watch! Season three has just started and I'm dying to see what's in store for Dr. House and company this year.",1158278400,,5412,4.632291666666666
2592312,4,B000FVQLIO,"I caught this season in reruns over the summer.  I found it a wonderful change from the typical run of the mill doctor shows.  In this show House does not attempt to feign a polite bedside manner.  I personally found him hilarious in that he says what you imagine every doctor really wants to say.  He strikes me as an impolite version of Quincy, from the 1970s.

The early season with the interaction between House and ex-girlfriend Stacy (Sela Ward) was slow, but as the season progresses his staff, Drs. Cameron, Foreman, and Chase, begin to take a larger role in the episodes.  I found the devolopment of their characters interesting as they seem to play different aspects that are missing from House's personality.

This season gives you a lot of background on House, however, beware that the season does end with you wanting to see more.",1157846400,,843,4.6938775510204085

The five star reviews, posted here, are for the most part accurate and to reiterate is redundant. I will focus on the differences between the two popular (medical) drama series listed here, both usually in the top ten best sellers.

Grey's Anatomy will appeal to the evening soap opera crowd, who also liked Friends (and is swayed easily to chuckle along with the laugh track, instead of the actual dialogue and whose view of real world is somewhat fantasy based). House, on the other hand. Nuff said!",1157760000,,622,4.75

One of the  problems I had with this season  was the unusing during this season of the talented actress Sela Ward. She held her own against Hugh Lurie's House in the episodes she was in. When she vanished and her arc was finished, it was a let down.

Last year there was a sub plot about a spy in House's close knit group of doctors. This year's sub plot was focused on actor Omar Epps's character Foreman who became  House's  boss for a few episodes and his serious illness in the two part episode Euphoria,(one of the season's best). The problem Foreman  seemed almost  healed by the next episode Forever.

This series second season was stronger than the first. If you like the show, this is something akin to Godfather II to be better than the original...and if that is true season three (the new season ) must be a killer! The second season opener ""Acceptance"" (with LL Cool J), the two parter ""Euphoria"" and final episode ""No Reason"" is worth the price of  DVD box set alone..and you get 20 more episodes as a bonus!

For fans of audio commentary, there are two by the producers David Shore (who also wrote and directed the season two final episode ""No Reason"").Also for EXTRA fans,  there are outtakes, deleted seasons and a small version of the cast of House at the Broadcasting Museum discussion

2592315,5,B000FVQLIO,"First, this review applies only to the USA/Canada (Region 1) release.

My 3 biggest complaints from the Season 1 DVD packaging and production have been corrected with the Season 2 offering.

Gone is the horrible decision to use double-sided DVDs of Season 1.  Season 2 has 6 single-sided DVDs. Although the DVD's are not individually sleeved, it is still a great improvement from the easily damaged double-sided DVDs of last season.

The video quality is vastly improved from Season 1.  The Season 1 DVDs had a very noticiable ""graininess"" to them (ie: low resolution).  The production value of the Season 2 DVDs are much more what one should expect from a DVD.  The audio also seems much better than from Season 1.

BONUS FEATURES!  Yes, Season 2 offers bonus features normally expected, including a blooper reel, producer commentary (two episodes), and couple cute/funny scenes with Cameron and Cutty redone in ""Valley Girl"" speak.

The packing is still a snap-pack slip-case, and you can see some customer-supplied photos of the packaging if you view the extra photos below the main image for this product.

As for the content of Season 2 itself, I don't think I need to give anyone a reason to buy -- who buy's a TV series on DVD unless they already know and love it!",1157068800,,1271,4.784403669724771
2592316,5,B000FVQLIO,"appointment television:
1. a program that someone schedules time to view every week
2. House

This has become the only show I must watch each week and viewing the second season episodes end-to-end reminds me why. It's just plain fun to watch. From the hilarious Hugh Laurie to the addictive heartbeat of its theme song, it is both surprising and repetitive all at once. If you ever think they've solved the puzzle in the first 30 minutes, you haven't seen any other episodes.

The writing can be maddeningly frustrating while delivering huge entertainment. The character development of the whitecoat trio (Foreman, Cameron, and Chase) is often ""don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it"" brief but they are still well-differentiated and engagingly acted. An out-of-the-blue personal crisis for Cuddy seems arbitrary but makes for great banter between Lisa Edelstein and Laurie. And the will-they-won't-they drama between the scruffy, drug-addled House and the blindingly gorgeous, immaculate ex (Sela Ward) who saved his life by crippling him seems anomalous with its surroundings and unlikely on its face but gives us a peek into House's heart of hearts.

Improvements on Season 1's set include single-sided discs, true widescreen transfer instead of terrible letterboxing, the addition of more bonus features (especially Edelstein's and Jennifer Morrison's ""Valley Girl"" versions of selected scenes - I hope this becomes a tradition), and the spreading of those bonuses among the discs rather than lumping them all in one place. One nit: The discs are stacked in groups of two, so those with three hands are at an advantage when trying to pull an even-numbered disc out of the fold-out packaging.

My candidate for gag of the year is from the strawberry jelly scene:
House: Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics. And you probably shouldn't have sex for awhile.

Daddy's Boy, showed a student with weird electrical shocks that they try to figure out, and House's parents come to visit him.

2592324,5,B000FVQLIO,Hugh Laurie makes this show. I love it and Hugh's face is so hauting. Pick it up!!,1150675200,,82,3.8823529411764706
2592325,5,B000FVQLIO,"While some shows experience a ""sophomore slump"" of sorts, this was certainly not the case with ""House"" which picked up right where it left off with more great stories and more interesting cases. Once again, Hugh Laurie stars as the mysterious and brilliant Dr. House. Also back are his crack team of assistants Drs. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), and Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), his loyal friend Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), and his regularly exasperated boss Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein).

In season 2, the show broke the mold a little bit and focused a little more on the backgrounds of the characters to give us a better idea of who they are and how they came to be working at the hospital. Especially interesting was the relationship between Dr. House and his former girlfriend Stacy Warner (Sela Ward). This storyline gave viewers a better idea of who House is and how he came to be the way that he is.

Standout episodes from this season include ""Acceptance"" (about a death row inmate), ""Skin Deep"" (about a beauty queen with a bizarre ailment), ""Failure to Communicate"" (about a journalist who can't talk), ""Euporia"" (about a sick cop), and ""No Reason"" (abot what happens after House gets shot).

And of course, House is back with some more zingers:

Jack: ""I don't want to hear semantics.""

House: ""You anti-semantic bastard.""

- No Reason

""Why do you wanna sleep on a couch anyway? You got money. At least until the divorce is finalized.""

- Clueless

Cameron - ""Could pain medication cause an orgasm?""

House - ""I wish.""

- Distractions

Wilson - ""Did you know your phone is dead? Do you ever recharge the batteries?""

House - ""They recharge? I just keep buying new phones.""

- Failure to Communicate

""Is it still illegal to perform an autopsy on a living person?""

- Autopsy",1150243200,,1835,4.796178343949045
2592326,5,B000FVQLIO,"House season two provides some of the best hours in television. Just excellent writing and great performances. The only part I didn't like so much is the Stacy arc. I find that she just slows down the storylines. But the rest of the season is superb and the season finale just blows you away. I highly recommend this.

My favorite episodes of the season are:

1. Autopsy
2. TB or not TB
3. Daddy's Boy
4. Deception
5. Safe
6. All In
7. House vs God
8. Euphoria
9. No Reason",1150243200,,473,4.186813186813187
2592327,5,B000FVQLIO,"After having seen Hugh Laurie in shows such as Black Adder (in which is absolutely hysterical) and movies (Sense and Sensibility and Peter's Friends), anything he is in had to be terrific.  So when the trailers for the first season started playing and Hugh Laurie was going to star in it, I knew I had to watch it.  I wasn't disappointed and couldn't wait for Season 2 to start this past January.  I am glad they will be starting Season 3 on September 5th rather than mid season.  Season 2 picked up the story line following the relationship between House and the return of Stacy that was the bombshell of Season 1.  I was glad there was resolution of sorts, and was also glad it happened early in the season.  House has to be House without distractions; it is what makes us love him.  There is a reason why House scored consistantly in the Nielsen top 10 this past season; it is because it is a terrific show that doesn't have to constantly show gore to get the point across.  All the characters are intertwined and the dynamics of their relationships and how they relate to each other and their patients is what carries the show's points across.  Anyone who likes a show that is fast paced and intellectually sound should watch this show and own it on DVD so it can be enjoyed over and over.",1150243200,,1293,4.421940928270042
2592328,5,B000FVQLIO,"The excitement leading to last year's second season premiere was richly rewarded by this outstanding sophomore outing.  No disappointments here.  If anything, the stories, writing, acting and guest appearances in Season 2 of House were far superior to those of the first season.  In particular, the extraordinarily courageous and fierce performance of Hugh Laurie as House seared the screen in every episode.  He and series creator David Shore were not afraid to send their lead character down a darkening path toward self-doubt and destruction.  The show's trademark scathing wit, poignant insights, and twisty medical storytelling continue strongly evident in this second season. Complicated and nuanced portrayals by excellent supporting actors Lisa Edelstein, Robert Sean Leonard, and Omar Epps make this season one to treasure. Showcasing worthy guest stars like Sela Ward, Cynthia Nixon, Charles Dutton, and Ron Livingston, this season  boldly established House as the top drama on television, bar none.  Highly recommended.",1150156800,,1030,5.69281045751634
2592329,3,B000FVQLIO,"The Season 1 DVD boxset was rather rushed into production for an early release before the Season 2 premiere and hence was not in widescreen, as planned, was on double-sided discs and the extras were a bit on the paltry side. This time, with a bit more time on their hands, it looks like TPTB have taken the fans' criticisms into account. No news on the widescreen issue but early reports indicate that the Season 2 DVDs will be single-sided and feature the following extras:

""An Evening With 'House'""; Alternate Takes; ""It Could Be Lupus""; ""No Reason"" Commentary, Audio Commentary, Documentary, Featurette, Gag Reel

Aside from the fact that I'd be buying it anyway, it's gotta be worth getting just for the prospect of a House gag reel!! :D",1150156800,,742,4.744186046511628
2592330,5,B000FVQLIO,"House is one of my favorite shows and I bought season 1 only to have it arrive and not to be the widescreen dvd as advertised,only to be a pathetic windowbox image on my HD widescreen. I hope the studio read our many complaints here after the last release and will do it right this time. The image looks like crap if you bump it up to fill the screen,so I'm waiting this time.

UPDATE: It's widescreen and the transfer is beautiful,well worth the $$$$",1149724800,,451,4.305882352941176
