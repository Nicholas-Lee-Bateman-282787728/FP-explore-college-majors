2467090,4,B000CNESV2,"WHAT A WAY TO CELEBRATE 40+ years in time and space with the first 3 episodes! Presented here are the first 3 William Hartnell stories arcs in 1 set. This is a great way to be introduced to the longest running TV sci-fi series in (and of) history. When we first meet the Doctor's ""granddaughter"" SUSAN, through her concerned and curious school teachers, IAN & Barbara.  The Doctor, very the ANTI-HERO, almost frightening in this story, as he almost abducts the pair to protect his secret (not that he is a Timelord) that he is from ""the future"" and can travel in time and space. The outer shape of the time machine, A.K.A. the TARDIS remains stuck in the famous police-call-box disguise as it appears on the cusp of the ""ice age."" After a great 2 episode start, ""Unearthly Child"" becomes a fairly cliched tale of escape and capture RUNNING from and with cavemen. In 1963, Film and time was at a premium for the fledgling show, so many flubbed lines and missed cues remain in this remastered set. IT IS STILL A MUST SEE/OWN STORY FOR new and old DR. WHO FANS.

The next story introduces the Doctors 40 yr. nemesis, and easily he revial for pop culture popularity, THE DALEKS in the aptly title story arc, ""The Daleks."" For a series that was intended to introduce history to children, the show immediately gets off track in this 2nd story, introducing the Doctor's classic alien-cyborg foe, thank God. Overall, not a great story, but it is so monumentous a meeting that it is fun to watch on that merit alone!

The 3rd story arc ""The Edge of Destruction"" is what the Trek writers refered to as a ""bottle episode."" In an attempt to cut costs on enough stories to save money for the big shows, we have a story contained completely in the TARDIS control room. The ""characters trapped in an elevator"" story is a fast, cheap way of establishing and defining characters early in a series, Edge of Destruction is highly successful in this way.

This is a great set at a good price.

2467091,5,B000CNESV2,"There was William Hartnell. The very first Doctor, in his first 3 serials.

I've waited for this a very long time.

We are very lucky that these serials even exist, considering the way the BBC destroyed many of it's own archives, way back in the 1970's. These programs are really showing thier age, (1963) and look very shabby compared with the Doctor's many other incarnations, however this is what makes this show so fun. The cheezy sets, the shoestring production values, all contribute to this show's mass appeal.  And not to mention it's longevity. 41 years with 10 Doctors is a lot of time travel.

Other than being a fan, I am just happy to have the first 3 Doctor Who serials in a format that will pretty much last me the rest of my life.",1135987200,12,746,4.463235294117647
2467092,5,B000CNESV2,"After years of delays (these three stories were originally supposed to be a VHS box set in 1999), we're getting what hordes of Doctor Who fans have been waiting for--a meticulously restored, extras-laden DVD release of the first three serials from 1963-64.  These three stories encompass the 13 episodes that the series was originally commissioned for, before being quickly renewed due to the sensation caused by the first appearance of the Daleks in the second story (the series went on to run for 26 years).

This set, however, might not be the best starting place for neophytes unless they're fans of things like 1930s movie serials like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.  Yes, early Doctor Who is in black and white, features early-60s TV production values, and, while Doctor Who DVDs are among the most painstakingly restored archive television product available, the ravages of time and poor storage on the source material may put off viewers who are unused to watching vintage TV.  For anyone who's already a fan, however, what we have here is the answer to a lot of people's prayers, emails, and letters to the BBC.",1134518400,23,1119,4.904761904761905
2467093,5,B000CNESV2,"Finally the first 3 William Hartnell stories released in 1 package. This is a great way to be introduced to the series. The 1st story 'An Unearthly Child' starts off great, the first 1 1/2 episodes are excellent then the story becomes a fairly cliched 'be captured, escape, be captured, escape again' type of story. It's worthwhile because it introduces all the concepts still being used in the series today-the TARDIS, the Doctor as an alien on the run from his own race, having human companions to give the series a human perspective.

Story 2-'The Daleks'. What more can be said about this? We wouldn't be watching Christopher Eccleston or David Tennant today if not for this story. While we're on the subject of the Daleks-Hey BBC how about releasing Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker's Dalek stories soon?

Story 3-'Inside the Spaceship'-an interesting little 'bottle' show using only the 4 main characters and the TARDIS set. This story gets into the psychology of the characters and resolves the issue of distrust among the TARDIS crew, leaving them as a strong and friendly group.

I've also heard there will be a telesnap reconstruction of the 4th story 'Marco Polo' in this set as well. I listened to the audio version of this story and it's great. It's a real shame that this story no longer exists.

Those who come to this through the new show will be surprised. This isn't the Doctor you're used to: he's not yet the man entire species fear and want dead -- he's a jerk-ass. The TARDIS is a mere machine, neither Gallifrey nor Time Lords are mentioned, and the Daleks are the canned survivors of a nuclear holocaust, confined to their city (they would not become the show's perennial villains until 'The Dalek Conquest of Earth').

It was intended originally to alternate between science fiction and historical stories, with the historical stories intended as educational. All the Doctor would be was the chauffeur (and occasional plot driver) while the companions did all the heavy lifting. Eventually, those features changed, and the show -- while still with a budget that seemed to be drawn from petty cash and turned-out pockets -- became the one most people think of now.",1499126400,,990,4.886904761904762

2467126,5,B000CNESV2,"Soon after the modern Doctor Who series exploded onto the television scene, we fell in love with all things Doctor Who.  Naturally we wanted to learn more about how it all started.  Buying Doctor Who: The Beginning (An Unearthly Child/The Daleks/The Edge of Destruction) (Stories 1-3) was an easy decision to make.  These DVDs include some of the few remaining black and white, Doctor Who episodes with the First Doctor.  The episodes are done in serial style with stories extended over multiple episodes, with cliff hanger type endings in between.  First released in 1963, these episodes are not the action packed, special effects filled adventures modern Doctor Who fans watch today.

Seeing how it all began was truly an eye opening experience.  From a modern perspective, the beloved Doctor truly had rather humble beginnings.  Traveling with his niece in the original TARDIS, the Doctor visits different times and different places just like the modern Doctor.  However, watching the original few shows is a great way to see just how much the Doctor has evolved over the decades.  I certainly never got the impression the William Hartnell Doctor was from a planet called Galifrey and the Daleks certainly didn't appear to be involved with a long term war with the Doctors people.  However, loving the Doctor means suspending disbelief anyway so nothing much changes in that regard.

All in all, these early quirky shows are best suited for true Doctor Who fans.  We love them though we do not watch them over and over like with do the modern episodes.",1468281600,2,1555,4.957528957528957

2467135,3,B000CNESV2,"Dr Who: The Beginning  BBC 2012

What TV shows have run as long as Dr. Who?  Star Trek came first to my mind [dont laugh].  Yes, that only ran 3 seasons originally; it was the sequels and the movies that make it seem like its been around forever.  Bonanza?  14 seasons.  Dr. Who has run approximately 37 years with 826 episodes [97 of which haven't been retrieved according to Wikipedia].  I picked up this re-release of the earliest episodes with the first Doctor, just to see what it looked like in the beginning.  This has 3 DVDs covering 1963-4 and 13 episodes.  These all have William Hartnell, the first Doctor and Carole Ann Ford as his granddaughter [supposedly 16 years old].

Oh my.  I don't think a viewer will take great joy here, unless you really are some sort of TV historian.  It does start with the very first episode and even 2 versions: the pilot, and the show as broadcast.  The two have the same basic plot but much of the dialog was altered between pilot and airing; generally I thought making the Doctor a little bit less unfriendly.

The first four episodes are given the rubric An Unearthly Child because it begins with a female and male school teacher [Ian and Barbara] discussing their odd student Susan Foster.  She knows way too much about some things and way too little about others.  They follow her home and meet a highly displeased Doctor, who does not want their true identity known to humans.  He doesnt want to release the teachers or theyll tell others, and hence they become willy-nilly traveling companions, making a foursome.

Hartnell was vaguely reminiscent of Basil Rathbone by appearance [both were before my time].  The two teachers are nondescript and Susan Foster is a cute although overly-mature granddaughter.  As I mentioned, in the pilot Hartnells Doctor is unfriendly.  In the released version he is somewhat less so, but clearly much more concerned about his safety and his granddaughters than about what happens to two earthlings.  Attitudes among the four change over the episodes, and in the third story line the Doctor makes the astute observation that By observing others one learns things about oneself.  The teachers have gone from intruders hed just as soon throw out the airlock, to valuable companions.

I have to indulge some sarcasm now, as its just so much fun.  Dedicated fans: spare my life, please!  The first trip away from London is to a prehistoric stone-age culture.  First I thought: Oh clever: contrasting the teachers understanding of a Time Lord to a cave mans understanding of what 20th century culture would be!  But as I listened I realized no, that cant be it: the analogy is that like these cave men haven't yet learned how to start fires, BBC hadnt yet learned how to write a script.  And if the four actors have some genuine acting ability, the directing seemed designed to obscure it.  Oh the awkward pauses!  Oh the stilted dialog!  Oh the caricatures of personality!  It wasn't surprising that episodes from 1963 are black and white and extremely grainy like watching a first Outer Limits or Twilight or something.  It was more disconcerting that remastered sound had them stuttering at times like they had some neurological disorders.  It wasn't surprising that plots were fairly simple [individual episodes were only about 24 minutes long].  What was surprising was how they could make 24 minutes feel like an eternity and force me to fast-forward.

Back to some plusses.  You get to hear Dr--. Who? spoken for the very first time [sealing his name, of course].  You get to see a granddaughter who is long gone by 2005.  You compare old TARDIS with new TARDIS.  Old Tardis actually isn't too bad [other than being B&W].  It looks more built and less grown like the modern TARDIS.  The difference is the most noticeable in the central console, which has a nice clear-glass like structure in the middle and is interesting.

Disc 2: DALEKS!  See the very first Dalek ever glimpsed by man!  [toilet-plunger or whatever, being the first glimpse ].  Seven whole episodes, a dead planet, a nuclear war between Dalek and [I forgot the humanoids' name, sorry].

Disc 3: Two episodes dubbed Edge of Destruction, in which an on-board accident causes strange behavior and paranoia.  As I mentioned, perhaps most memorable to me is how it has the Doctor fully accepting the human pair as companions, by the end. [drat: Id hoped to witness the first regeneration here].

Same basic musical theme as the modern Who.  The modern score is better, of course, but this is instantly recognizable.
Yes, this set now plays just fine in north American DVD players, and has subtitles.

Summary: As an early human embryo looks somewhat like a piglet, the very beginning of the good Doctor is hardly a star-child here.  Its very rudimentary, compared to what was to come.  I think the plot advantages of being able to go almost anywhere and any-time, much like the flexibility in a series like Outer Limits or Star Trek, and the perennial interest in science and in the future, gave this series the kind of room it would need to endure.  Somewhere along the way, script and directing also apparently are discovered.  Not to mention color, surround sound, hi-def, and on and on.  Cant help myself though: moving on to sample doctors 2 through eight.",1458864000,2,5311,4.792723263506064

Side note: The 3rd story in the set (The Edge of Destruction) is very weak in script and plot. The characters are struggling through their lines.

2467157,4,B000CNESV2,"""Doctor Who"" has been a beloved science fiction series for more than fifty years, and (as I write this) is currently on the twelfth incarnation of the Time Lord known as the Doctor.

But every epic story has to start somewhere. ""Doctor Who: The Beginning"" brings viewers back to the very first episodes of ""Doctor Who"" in 1964 -- there was no mythos or history, just a strange old man who travelled time and space in a police box. And despite the slow pace, these are some very well-written, intriguing episodes that easily introduce viewers to the Doctor, his greatest enemy, and the first humans to find out how weird the universe can be.

Schoolteachers Barbara (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian (William Russell) are both perplexed by a student who attends their school -- Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) is a genius in some areas, but seems woefully ignorant in others. They decide to talk to her grandfather about her, only to find that her address is a junkyard with a police box in it. When they stumble inside, they discover the truth -- Susan and her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), are actually aliens, and the police box is a TARDIS, a ship that can travel instantly through time and space.

Since humans have found out what they are, the Doctor declares that he and Susan need to leave then-contemporary London, but Susan is adamant that she wants to stay where and when she is. So the Doctor decides to go on a jaunt into the very distant past to avoid exposure... whether Barbara and Ian like it or not. As a result, they end up imprisoned by a tribe in the Paleolithic, where a power struggle is going on over who can make fire.

""The Daleks"" become a problem when the TARDIS lands on a planet full of radiation and petrified trees. When they wander into an alien city, they are captured by the Daleks -- vicious, mutated cyborg creatures who believe them to be their enemies, the pacifistic Thals. And escaping from the Daleks is only the group's first problem. With a vital piece of the TARDIS missing, they must convince the Thals to make war on their ancient enemies, before the entire planet is wrecked.

And ""The Edge of Destruction"" rains even more trouble on them, when the TARDIS stalls out, knocking out the inhabitants and causing them to suffer bouts of amnesia. Susan has bouts of violent behavior, the Doctor suffers a concussion and becomes paranoid about his human passengers, and the doors keep opening and shutting for no reason. Has some alien creature managed to infiltrate the TARDIS, or is the problem one of them?

""Doctor Who: The Beginning"" is a weird experience for people only introduced to the Doctor later in the series -- not only is the whole thing in black-and-white, but he's old and crotchety and doesn't seem very fond of humans in general. Plus, he also has a teen granddaughter. Furthermore, the now-established staples of the series (the TARDIS, the Daleks) are just being introduced here, giving the feeling of a show that has yet to take a definite shape.

But these three serials are pretty good science fiction -- one story takes place in another time, the second in another world, and the third explores the nature of the TARDIS -- and they form a foundation for the series to come. The writing is pretty solid (""What are we going to do? Can we live here? What do we eat? There are millions of questions."" ""A very good idea. I'm hungry""), and despite the simplicity of the stories, there's a depth and complexity to the morals and motivations of the characters -- the Doctor is tempted to kill a man to save them, and the Thals are caught between their pacifistic hatred of war and the need to fight to save others.

The only problem is that ""The Edge of Destruction"" has a rather underwhelming ending -- the explanation for what's going on is just kind of underwhelming, especially after such a haunting, intense buildup of paranoia and suspicion. But hey, at least it introduces the fact that the TARDIS is no ordinary spaceship/time machine, and reminds us that while Barbara and Ian are traveling with the Doctor, none of these people are really friends.

And despite the crotchety nature of the First doctor, William Hartnell still made his character a very impressive one -- his doctor can be arrogant and presumptuous (since he basically kidnaps Ian and Barbara), but he's fair-minded and admits it immediately whenever he screws up. Ford is a pretty standard drama-llama teen girl who spends a lot of time yelling and crying, but who does have a genuine yearning for new experiences. Hill and Russell make pretty decent ""everymen"" for audiences to identify with, and over these serials they evolve into real characters on their own -- Barbara isn't afraid to bellow at the Doctor when he accuses her and Ian of sabotage.

""Doctor Who: The Beginning"" reveals the infancy of the ""Doctor Who"" series -- the story was raw and unformed, but still intelligently-written and overflowing with imagination and potential. It has a few snafus, but it's a fascinating watch.",1433376000,,5033,4.735159817351598

Episode One

 is AN UNEARTHLY CHILD where Susan and her 'grandfather' are spied on by 2 teachers, thinking that they live in a police box.

Episode Two

is THE DALEKS, an introduction that made Doctor  Who is complete success in Britain.  Every child was saying ""Exterminate.""

Episode Three

is THE EDGE OF DESTRUCTION where the relationships and the personality of the the Doctor are adjusted into the gentler Doctor and more of a team.  Very Clever.",1404777600,,745,4.603053435114504

It was enticing and fascinating to see the Doctor's first encounter with the Daleks. It also kept it interesting to learn about the Thals, a fellow race on the Dalek's home planet of Skaro. The Edge of Destruction was a nice two episode bonus and there was also a reconstruction (~20 mins) of Marco Polo, the missing fourth serial of the Hartnell era.",1404345600,,634,4.5701754385964914

I do plan to watch this, but mostly for backround information, not so much the enjoyment. And don't get me wrong, I actually enjoy watching old movies and plan to investigate silent films, so I know older tv has less quality, but this is particularly bad to me since It's not nearly as old as some movies I've seen and the scripting is way worse.

It is also chockfull of excellent extras. I picked it up just to get the commentaries on these shows. The first ever appearance of the Daleks is right here on this set.

2467222,4,B000CNESV2,My memory (as I loaned this disc to someone who now has had it for > 4 months) is that the ordering of titles of the episodes on this disc does not coincide with the actual order that they play in (in terms of volume number on the disc).  Having watched mainly episodes with Tom Baker I decided to buy this in order to begin watching from the very beginning of the show.  Overall I can't say I am disappointed with any of the episodes and recommend it to people who follow this sort of science fiction.  It is probably better than 9/10ths of what is on TV today.,1397260800,,562,4.137614678899083

2467224,4,B000CNESV2,"I'm a completionst. Let me just say that right away. I discovered Doctor Who just this year, and wanted to know about it. Finding out the series is 50 years was amazing to me! I promptly tracked down the very first episodes, only to discover this collection won't be so easy to complete.... for starters several episodes are lost to the public.
That being said... going back to the very beginning was a treat. I watched it with my family and even my kids stayed focused. The video quality is far better than expected and the sound actually holds up on a surround sound.
My biggest gripe is the pilot episode, which showcases a disturbingly harsh Doctor, isn't a special feature. It plays right before the first episode and with the exception of the Doctor, are very similar. In fact for the first 5 to 10 minutes you could swear the same episode is replaying.
That being said, this is  for hardcore  Doctor Who fans. And it's a real treat to experience",1394236800,,952,4.52906976744186
2467225,5,B000CNESV2,"When did The Beginning go out of print? Last time I checked it was only $17.99 for this set which is pretty much the best deal of the classic Doctor Who ever. You get three full stories including An Unearthly Child, The Daleks and The Edge of Destruction.
For the money you can't beat An Unearthly Child since it started it all and you can't beat the original Dalek story by Terry Nation.
I have since bought this set a long long time ago and wondered if it would go out of print with the rest of most of the surviving Hartnell's and Troughten era stories on DVD but hey folks don't ever get tricked by Amazon 3rd party prices. I believe there still currently plenty more sites that have this set at it's original price.
For anyone who is a fan of the classic series this should have been in your collection years ago, and for those just discovering classic Doctor Who because of the new series you can still get this very first set of stories from the 1st Doctor at a reasonable price elsewhere and keep doing searches online... for instance you can still get this set on BestBuy.com for $19.99 so if you NEED it now go get it!!!
Also for the Hatnell years I recommend: The Aztecs, Planet of Giants, The Keys to Marinus, Dalek Invasion of Earth (which is a sequel to The Daleks in this set), The Rescue/The Romans, The Space Museum/The Chase, The Time Meddler, The Gunfighters, The War Machines and The Tenth Planet as the best of the 1st Doctor's adventures if you can get ahold of them for a good price. Speaking of The Dalek Invasion of Earth and The Space Museum/The Chase are still both available at a nice affordable price so I HIGHLY recommend picking them up at the same time as this set as well since you can get shipping for free on Amazon when The Beginning goes down in price again as a package deal... you won't regret it.

Just added this - if you are a true Classic Doctor Who fan you can get An Unearthly Child as the second disc combo set of An Adventure in Space and Time DVD or DVD/Blu-ray set. The show is exceptional and I think a MUST HAVE for any serious Doctor Who collector. The special was a TV movie made last year in accordance to the 50th Anniversary and it's about 90 minutes of pure magic and heartwarming wonderment and nostalgia. I'm not old enough to have watched the original series when it was first broadcast on the BBC nor where American even privy to it in the 60's. But if you are a fan at all of the Hartnell era of Doctor Who then An Adventure in Space in Time is an absolute must have... it tells the tale of the creator of Doctor Who and it's first Producer Varity Lambert played wonderfully by the Jessica Raine from Call the Midwife fame (which is another wonderful and glorious BBC drama series depicting the past.
Jessica Raine also appeared in Series Seven of the new show in the episode entitled ""Hide"". David Bradley portrays William Hartnell brilliantly and perfectly and would have made an excellent Doctor himself by the way... and the ever fantastic Brian Cox plays Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman... it's a wonderful companion piece to The Beginning.
So in my personal opinion if you are trying to collect the William Hartnell era Doctor here's my suggestion of the essentials and best complete stories on DVD or and Blu-ray.d
And I only recommend complete stories - the only non-complete story I do recommend from the Hartnell era is The Tenth Planet and that's only because it is his last and the first Regeneration sequence so it's a very very important episode in the Who canon.

1. The Beginning (An Unearthly Child/The Daleks/Edge of Destruction).
2. An Adventure in Time and Space
3. The Aztecs (One of the very best historical stories ever!)
4. Planet of the Giants (A personal favorite!!!!)
5. The Keys to Marinus (Great quest story! Slow at first but stick with it you will be rewarded!)
6. Dalek Invasion of Earth (An absolute must if you own The Beginning - the first DW sequel story and departure of the first companion Susan! So a very historic episode).
7. The Rescue/The Romans (The Romans is the absolute unquestioned BEST historic DW episode in my opinion. It has everything and is even surprisingly a bit naughty. Hartnell is at his absolute best in this, it's witty, charming and irreverent, fun, dramatic, whimsical and pitch perfect and definitely a crown jewel in the Doctor Who Universe!!!)
8. The Space Museum/The Chase (I am in the minority - most people consider The Chase the superior story here but I feel the same about the Space Museum nearly as much as I do about The Romans. It's an excellent science-fiction story and perfectly balances out The Romans. Most people sight only the opening segment as being good but I love the WHOLE story! This is adventure science-fiction at it's best and would pit The Space Museum up against any episode of the original Star Trek or Lost in Space or even the first Planet of the Apes film. It's seriously that good and unfortunately very underrated by even most Doctor Who fans...)
9. The War Machine (my 3rd personal favorite after Planet of the Giants and The Romans.) A very serious drama set in the then present swinging sixties! This is another Who episode at it's best. And again I put the best of the Hartnell era up against the best of any other Doctor even the new series and the War Machines is one of those. I wish they had filmed more 'contemporary' Hartnell stories giving up a slice of what everyday life was like when the show started... some people find the War Machine themselves hokey but I do not. Is R2D2 and C3PO hokey just because Star Wars came out in 1977? Or The Robot from Lost in Space? I still LOVE Lost in Space - it had a unique charm all their own and that's how I think of ALL the eras of Doctor Who...!)",1394064000,4,5763,4.482397716460514

2467254,5,B000CNESV2,"I was recommended by one of my youtube friends to check this show out so I decided to go for the first ever episodes to see what I thought of them. Having watched all three discs I feel I made a good decision. I found myself easily attracted to the premise of the show and found the character interactions interesting. Sure as a 60's show it feels somewhat slow paced but, surprisingly the low production values and the black and white didn't bother me one bitt. The first two story arcs I found enjoyable but I found the 3rd arc, Edge of Destruction, less interesting (although it was to be expected, as it's a bottle arc).

As for the set I was blown away by all the extra's I found, though I only sampled them to prevent spoilers from later in the show. The only other thing worth mentoning is that in my dvd set, discs two and three had the wrong titles and numbering on them. What was supposed to be disc two had disc three's content and vice versa. Thankfully all I had to do was switch the discs to appropreite spindle to correct the problem.

Good set and I'm looking forward to continuing with Doctor Who, Thank you Zaranyzerak.",1388793600,,1137,4.3584905660377355
2467255,4,B000CNESV2,"When it comes to William Hartman years I found The Dalek invasion of Earth as well as The Rescue/Romans to be better than the first three episodes.  Over all it not that bad.  It was interesting finally seeing AN UNEARTHLY CHILD for the first time since my local PBS station when it aired Doctor Who only aired doctors Patrick Throughton to Slyvester McCoy. Unearthly child was kind of slow compared to other doctor who episodes.  Episode 2  Daleks  was my favorite of this three episode set. It was real interesting to see how The Doctor met his would be greatest enemy for the first time and how different the Dalek home planet was original appearance. The forest remind me of the one from Face of Evil episode rather than dessert normally seen with Skaro.

Unlike others who reviewed this set my DALEK and EDGE OF DESTRUCTION disks weren't reverse labeled.",1388448000,3,859,4.693333333333333

It seems to be a running change, the artwork has been corrected. Disc 2 is now, properly, The Daleks. And Disk 3 is now, properly, The Edge of Destruction!

That out of the way, this is an excellent collection. Especially for the fans of classic Doctor Who. It brings us through the original introduction of The Doctor, his companions, and his magnificent ship the TARDIS. And it also brings us to his first-ever meeting with the universe's most-feared menace, the Daleks! Literally everything a Who fan could want!

Bonus features include commentaries, a condensed reconstruction of the lost (But RUMORS SAY it has recently been recovered!) serial Marco Polo. And some other excellent little goodies such as a documentary on The Daleks. A definite must-buy! (Purchased Black Friday/Cyber Monday at amazon, 2013)",1386201600,2,960,4.883435582822086
2467260,3,B000CNESV2,"I wish halves were allowed, because it's just slightly better than ""Just OK.""

Doctor Who:  The Beginnings is as far back as we the fans can go in Doctor Who lore (or as far as I know as of yet).  ""The Beginnings"" contains the first three and one quarters stories from Doctor Who.  I'll explain the 1/4 bit later.  An Unearthly Child, The Daleks, and the Edge of Destruction.

Why I like it:  It's the very beginning of the show that we all know and love.  And as to be expected, it's quite foreign compared to the show we have now or even the classic series later on.  This may be off-putting to some fans though.  You can see some of the basic characteristics of the Doctor showing through as well.  It also has the very first appearance of the Daleks.

Why I (kind of) don't like it (read:  little nit-picky things):  The Doctor is by no means the central character at this point, and has by no means become the character that we all know and love today.  The Doctor's granddaughter Susan is also quite the annoying character.  All she's good for is screaming and giggling.  Sometimes inappropriately as well.  Some of that could be due to the nature of the filming process they used (pretty much a live recording.  No cuts or edits).

Why others might NOT like it:  It is the 1960s.  The special effects are lack luster at best by today's standards, and the art of story telling on television back then was vastly different from the way it's done now.  You can't watch this thinking it's going to have mind blowing action scenes.  You have to watch it for what it is:  a sci-fi show from the '60s.

Who should buy it:  Probably anyone that grew up with the show back in the '60s and '70s.  If you're a fan of the new show and have some experiences with the classic show and you're wanting to see it all or where Doctor Who got it's start, go for it!  If you're a fan of the new show and you're dabbling with watching the classic series and are looking for a good Hartnell story to start on or you're entertaining the idea of starting into the classic series but don't know where to start, you may want to pass on this one.  The first story, while not bad, is kind of slow for a show opener, and the intro to the Daleks can lag along a bit as well.  The third story is pretty much a filler story in my opinion.

Some nice extras are the interviews with various folks involved with getting Doctor Who off the ground, as well as the original pilot episode that was filmed and subsequently replaced with a new episode one.  Another addition is story 4 is here, or twenty-some-odd minutes of the audio cut to still images.  This is somewhat significant because all the episodes for Marco Polo are currently MIA.",1386028800,23,2710,4.343313373253493
2467261,5,B000CNESV2,"I've seen all of Hartnell's seasons and I personally LOVE An Unearthly Child. It gives me the chills the //very// first time the TARDIS is seen on the screen; similar to the first time I saw Doctor Who with Series 1 Episode 1 (""Rose"" with Christopher Eccleston & Billie Piper).",1384905600,,277,4.56
2467272,5,B000CNESV2,"I love everything Doctor Who, and I say that because I understand that it can skew my opinion. Even the worst episodes I can find some merit in.  There are the first three serials are included in entirety in this set as well as a reconstruction of the fourth.  As far as the packaging is concerned, I have read many times on here, and mine is the same way, the Disc labeled as ""The Daleks"" is actually ""The Edge of Destruction"" and vice versa.  Just be prepared for it.

An Unearthly Child: A start to a legacy.  Two different takes on the pilot episode are included.  They are very similar in most aspects but in certain others they are two different shows.  Make sure to watch both so you can see the evolution of the show, and what could have been and thankfully wasn't.  As far as the rest of the serial goes, it is weak.  There is a lot of character development that takes place, which is necessary to the show, but can make the show seem to move really slow.  However, there are some good moments in it.

The Daleks: The daleks, the Doctor's oldest enemy, is the star of the second serial.  For being a Dalek's episode, it is the weakest I have seen, but that is because it is the first and Terry Nation had to figure out what to do with them.  However it is in this serial that Doctor Who starts to actually feel like Doctor Who and not just something trying to figure out what it is.  Definitely recommend watching it.  It is reward for making it through ""The Unearthly Child.""

The Edge of Destruction:  Set entirely in the TARDIS, we see only the four main characters interact with one another.  They do a fantastic job. It finally gives a chance for the characters to develop their relationships with one another.  It is a little dry and anticlimactic, but the character development is a must see.

Marco Polo: One of the completely lost serials, it has been included as a 30 minute telesnap and audio reconstruction.  I found this to be a little boring, just because you have to condense 7-25 minute episodes into 1 30 minute episode.  However I recommend watching it to see what happens between ""The Edge of Destruction"" and ""The Keys of Marinus.""

Hopefully that helps a bit.  Remember that most likely the second and third discs will be mislabeled, but that is something that is minor.  Enjoy ""The Beginning.""",1384905600,8,2324,4.463182897862233

2467282,4,B000CNESV2,"Doctor Who and the Beginning collection is a very good assortment of the first three Doctor Who stories ever to be released: An Unearthly Child, The Daleks, and The Edge of Destruction.

An Unearthly Child - (4 eps, 95 mins) Two teachers follow a mysterious student home to a police box, and the Doctor takes them on a short excursion back to 200,000 BC. The first episode is extremely good, especially if you watch the extended version. But thenit really starts to go downhill.

The Daleks - (7 eps, 169 mins) The TARDIS lands on the dead planet Skaro, where the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan explore a deserted city inhabited by the notorious Daleks! This story starts out strong, but it's just really slow-moving all the way through. Still good, though.

The Edge of Destruction - (2 eps, 47 mins) An explosion aboard the TARDIS triggers irrational feelings of aggression, paranoia and despair. This one has some good parts in it, but overall it's just pretty boring.

Overall this is a pretty good set, with some pretty good special features:

1. Audio Commentary by producer Verity Lambert, directors Waris Hussein, Christopher Barry and Richard Martin, actors Carole Ann Ford (Susan) and William Russell (Ian), moderated by Gary Russell.
2. Pilot Episode - Unedited studio recording, including outtakes (40 mins)
3. Doctor Who: Origins (53 mins)
4. Creation of the Daleks (18 mins)
5. Over the Edge - making the Edge of Destruction (30 mins)
6. Inside the Spaceship (10 mins)
7. Masters of Sound (12 mins)
8. Marco Polo - Condensed recon of a lost 7-part story (30 mins) (Easily the best special feature on here)
9. The Edge of Destruction ep 2 Arabic soundtrack
10. Photo Galleries (15 mins)
11. PDF materials - Radio Times listings, An Unearthly Child script
12. Production notes subtitles option
13. Digitally remastered picture and sound quality

2467301,5,B000CNESV2,"This box set is a must have for any Doctor Who fan interested in the classic era.  These first three stories along with a short recon of the missing fourth serial is important to the Doctor Who Universe.

Unearthly Child is an amazing tale, and the first episode on its own could be watched as a singular story.  It is an imaginative look into a strange individual called the Doctor.  If anything, this story is worth the lead up to the Doctor and Ian's confrontation about Intervention vs. Leaving Well Enough Alone.  The seed of trust and helping could very well be born in this moment.  The First Doctor is known to be a grumpy old fool, but it is his experiences that shape the personalities of Doctors to come.

The Daleks is a necessity.  No one knew at the time what a cultural icon they would become, but indeed this story led to one of the greatest sci-fi enemies of all time.  Clunky and slow, watching these creatures is still mesmerizing.  Although there are certainly moments that are slow in the story line ... it is an amazing serial to watch.

The Edge of Destruction is a two part story immediately after The Daleks.  Initially it wasn't even suppose to exist, but production for Marco Polo wasn't ready yet and so this story was written up quickly to fill the time.  Many fans don't care for it, but those that do love it.  I'm in the later category.  Though it is hard to follow, the concept of fear and paranoia of the unknown done entirely in one location is spell-binding.  Fans of the episode ""Midnight"" know what concepts are being touch upon in this story.

Lastly, story #4 is missing from the archives.  Thanks to the return of the telesnaps we are able to create a beautiful 15 minute recon of this 7 episode historical.  It is worth it just for these images.",1362700800,30,1787,4.459876543209877

2467323,5,B000CNESV2,"The DVD is to be a gift and has not been opened yet, but we saw the shows online, and I can attest to the fact that they are charming--a fun sort of campy mix of ""suspend-your-disbelief"" costuming and sets; soap opera close-ups brimming with talky angst, and sci-fi imaginativeness as the dangers unfold.

For the Dr. Who fan, it is wonderful to see the originals that started the show decades ago.  The old doctor of these episodes has a latent coldness that emerges sporadically in his interactions with his granddaughter who is traveling with him on the Tardis, and this adds an engaging (though troubling) depth to his character.  The granddaughter's energetic teenage innocence, and the dramatic problem-solving dialogues thick with romantic tension between ""Bah-bah-ra"" (Barabara with a British accent) and Chesterton heighten the melodrama.

The mystery:  We ordered this DVD from an Amazon seller located in our state. (There was a note in the online description that said the item actually could ship from various locations across the US.)  The sender's label indicated that the DVD had actually shipped directly from Wal-Mart. com!  Wow!  Is Wal-Mart infiltrating Amazon???  I am not a Wal-Mart fan at all and was surprised that my purchase shipped from there.  I wonder if Amazon is aware of this.",1353456000,,1308,5.0418604651162795

2467326,5,B000CNESV2,"While I'm mostly a fan of the latter-day version of Doctor Who, these episodes are tremendously involving. The Doctor moves from being a totally cold alien character to a man beginning to be changed forever by his human traveling companions.  And knowing this is the exact same character we're now seeing played by David Tennant and Matt Smith?  Incredible.  No other show has this breadth.

In a way, I'm glad I came at this program in ""reverse order"".  The new episodes, brilliant as they are, are given even greater depth by seeing where they all began.",1343692800,,556,4.75

Old-school sci fi that took the whole space travel theme and turned it on its head to include time travel... all without a real ""space ship"" since the TARDIS goes places instantly.  If you're a fan of the other Doctor Who episodes that aired prior to 1990, you should watch this so you can see how it all began.  This Doctor is a bit cranky and crotchety compared to the others and is not yet enamored with the human race, so it's an interesting contrast to some of the later Doctor reincarnations who thought of Earth as a second home.",1334880000,,612,4.213675213675214
2467329,4,B000CNESV2,"I am always amazed how gothic ""An Unearthly Child"" seems in retrospect, with the London bobby patroling a misty junkyard at night, the TARDIS set amongst discarded junk like a surrealist object, but most importantly in the portrayal of the Doctor.  Hartnell is constantly mean-spirited (the show obviously rethought the Doctor over the years).  More important, the tale seems today to be one of incest and pedophilia--the alienated schoolgirl with her strange knowledge, her failure in some subjects, her torment by classmates, her life with her ""grandfather"" who wants to keep her to himself (compare to Kings Row). Susan's oppression, real or imaginary, is emphasized by the subjective camera that bears down on her as her teachers ask her questions, placing her on the defensive.  The episode has an ""unconscious"" aspect that seems to reveal itself more with each passing decade.",1333324800,,882,5.24113475177305

I kept telling my wife that we should watch some of these earlier ones to see how different the Dr. is and all that and she was apprehensive about it.  We had made the mistake of watching an old episode of Battlestar Galactica after watching the new series and almost felt insulted.  I see why some people are against the idea of humans evolving from pond scum now.
However, regarding the Dr. Who series, we decided to go way back to the beginning and we're loving it.  A lot of it is a nostalgia factor, I'll admit, the old sets and seeing the first appearances of certain characters and elements of the show.  The acting is typical of the era and the stories, so far, are very basic compared to the in depth plots of today.  That being said, even for a non-dedicated Dr Who fan it's been a treat watching these shows and seeing how this legend began.

But the Daleks episode is classic doctor, and shows his true nature.  We see the doctors most iconic nemesis for the first time and you dislike them immediately.

1) This starts out as a children's drama and there is not much humor in it.
2) This feels more like watching theater than a TV show.
3) There is not much sci-fi in it once they get where they are going.
4) Episodes were not meant to be watched back to back. Leave some time between episodes to wonder about the cliffhangers.
The extras in this DVD set are awesome. Some comedy skits, behind the scenes of how the show got started. I appreciate the effort in trying to reconstruct the 4th story ""Marco Polo"", but seriously, just get the reconstructed audiobook.

2467342,4,B000CNESV2,"I just recently started getting into ""Doctor Who"" (after 45 years -- that's me, riding the cutting edge of science fiction) a few months ago, having decided to take the time to watch one of the ""new"" shows on BBCAmerica, and I've spent a little time reflecting on what took me so long. It's not like I didn't know about it, I caught a few episodes in the 70s and early 80s (more on that later), and even bought a copy of 1990's ""Doctoring the Tardis"" by the Timelords. But it never really got to me. The PBS showings at that time were of the earlier seasons, and the things that stuck in my craw were the image quality and production values. I knew it was because they were several years old, but that didn't matter to me at the time. They were produced on black and white video tape, which was common for the BBC, but was never very popular in the US, where film was used almost exclusively to produce scripted episodic series until the late 70s. Add to that the fact that British TV used PAL format, and they had to be converted to NTSC. So by the time they were shown in the US, they just looked terrible, like kinescopes of 50s sitcoms -- and the effects were cheap, and the acting was stiff... Not unlike the original series of Star Trek, to be fair (although that was on color film, at least).

But having now discovered something I'd been ignoring for so long, I decided, while I was catching up on the current batch, to look at some of the earlier ones, and I started with this, the first three stories. All the things that bothered me originally, that repelled me in the 70s, are still there. The B&W video tape is low resolution, the sets are crude, and the pacing is achingly slow by today's standards. But this time, I'm looking at it more like a historical document; qualities I found repellent back then seem quaint now. To complain about them would be like complaining about the dialog in a silent movie. And the theme music was quite revolutionary, really; while this was six years after ""Forbidden Planet"", Bob Moog's synthesizer was still a couple of years away.

And in addition, it's the first few stories. Any TV series takes a little while to settle down (cf. Star Trek), and that's apparent here as well. It's interesting to compare the pilot version of ""Unearthly Child"" with the version that actually aired. The Doctor (Hartnett reminds me of no one more than Frank Morgan as Professor Marvel in ""Wizard of Oz"") is even more of an ill-tempered jerk in the pilot. You can see him mellow out a bit even by the end of that story; by the time we meet Daleks, he's already starting to show more absent-mindedness than nastiness. Some of the stiffness of the writing seems due to the intent (as stated in Wikipedia) of ""Doctor Who"" being educational; this is apparently why Susan is a tween and Ian and Barbara are teachers (science and history, respectively). The Daleks don't look quite like the trash cans with wire coat-hangers stuck in them that I recalled, but they do have the plungers. While some details evolve over time, these are the ""origins"" episodes, and much of the premise is established here. There's even an offhand comment by the Doctor about how (for some reason) the Tardis seems stuck looking like a police box, although I didn't notice any further exposition. Make some allowances for the production if you feel you have to, it's worth it.

So, yeah, it looks like a BBC TV series from 1963. Whaddya gonna say? But if, like me, you are a recent discoverer of this very dense ""oeuvre"" (what a pretentious word), this is almost essential viewing.",1284940800,3,3586,4.522342064714946

The Doctor Who portrayed in this package is the total opposite. No one in this cast is witty. The plots are boring and the Doctor is annoying. I think he was meant to be. The crew survives in spite of themselves in these three stories and certainly not because of anything the Doctor does.
Even the 1950's series Superman has better plots even though each story here takes several episodes.
Not remembering a lot about the episodes I watched as a teen, I was disappointed by this package. I was pleased to see in another package that the third Doctor is starting to be more like the modern one, and even the first Doctor as shown in the story The Three Doctors is an improved character.

2467345,5,B000CNESV2,"American Doctor Who fans often get the short end of the stick when it comes to collecting their favorite show on DVD.  The individual discs cost a great deal and take up considerable space.  That's all different with The Beginning Collection though.  The three included discs, nicely packed into two DVD cases with a nice slip-cover includes the first FOUR Doctor Who stories.  Compared to the average asking price of a Doctor Who DVD, this is a real bargain. And, outside of the 30 minute reconstruction of the lost fourth story, this doesn't even begin to consider the excellent special features!  The ability to view these first few story arcs sequentially also helps put the original run of the show into perspective.  Older, and diehard, fans will appreciate this set for its historic value and nostalgia for the classic era of Doctor Who.  Newer fans may find themselves pleasantly surprised by the intriguing stories and remarkable degree of series structure between these first few episodes.  The clarity of the audio on these transfers is remarkable and these shows have never sounded better.  The visual quality of the episodes leaves quite a bit to be desired but, unfortunately, this is a shortcoming of the program itself and not a result of questionable transfer methods.  In general, the episodes  look just about as good as they can.

If you didn't know, this set contains the first four stories of the show and contains a bunch of interesting featurettes, commentaries, and text fact track.

The mistake, however, wasn't not knowing who the companions were; instead, the mistake was simply watching the least effective of the three first - and getting a false impression of William Hartnell's Doctor.  Of all the Doctor Who stories I've watched so far, from all the Doctor's regenerations, The Edge of Destruction was by far and away the least effective.  I didn't like the William Hartnell Doctor, nor did I like the Susan character.  But the  biggest problem was the story itself; it didn't make it clear why the Doctor and Susan were so paranoid (I suppose it was because they were, literally, out of time and space; and therefore completely out of their element).  At any rate, when I watched An Unearthly Child, I got a much more positive impression of Hartnell's Doctor - in fact, he was the only one of the four travelers who seemed to have a sense of the danger they were in.  I've read other reviews of other Doctors where Adric or Tegan or Peri was considered the worst companion ever.  But I nominate the Doctor's granddaughter Susan for that honor; she was simply unbearable.  Hartnell's Doctor, however, I would place just below Tom Baker's as the best of the early Doctors.",1241049600,2,1296,4.699115044247788
2467363,4,B000CNESV2,"This is certainly a classic ""Who"" collection containing the first three adventures of the series. The most classic ones would be the first two where you see it all begin and where you see the Doctor encounter his most deadly enemy, the Daleks, for the very first time.

It begins with ""An Unearthly Child"" which is no doubt my favorite one in the collection. Two teachers follow a mysterious pupil of theirs, Susan Foreman, to a junkyard where they meet a strange old man, the Doctor, who is Susan's grandfather. And once inside a nearby police box, the journey of a lifetime begins as the Doctor takes his granddaughter and her two teachers on a trip back through time to the Stone Age where they face danger and excitement at every turn. Will they ever leave the Cave of Skulls alive? ""An Unearthly Child"" has great acting and directing in it and the story is filled with action (mystery too if you've never seen ""Dr. Who"" before). The sets and special effects were great as well. When they step outside of the TARDIS for the very first time, it actually feels like they've gone back in time and never lets up. Plus you also get the original unaired pilot with the story, which in my opinion, is better than the actual transmitted episode. ""An Unearthly Child"" has four parts (five if you include the pilot)and gets five stars from me.

Then you have ""The Daleks"" where the Doctor and his companions land on the dead planet Skaro and meet the evil metallic Daleks for the very first time! It's got a great story in it. It has a real alien and eerie setting to it. And like ""An Unearthly Child"", it has great acting and directing in it. The only thing that disappoints is the fact that the story is too long. It would have been a lot better if it had been four or five parts instead of seven. Even six would have been better. But seven is way too much. Also, the Doctor's character is way too grumpy and selfish in this one. The only time when he actually seemed to care about the Thals is during the last two episodes. And he also doesn't seem to do much in this story either, leaving pretty much all of the heroics to Ian. But still, it's a pretty good story and certainly an iconic one. The Daleks make a great first appearance. This story gets three stars from me.

Finally you have ""The Edge of Destruction"" which kept me on the edge of my seet when I first watched it. Unfortunately, once you know the ending, it's not one to be watched a lot. But still it's a worthy two-parter, and I still like to watch it every now and then. There is an explosion on board the TARDIS which plunges the ship into darkness and knocks the Doctor and his companions out. When they recover they find themselves suffering from headaches and loss of memory. At times, both the TARDIS and its crew memebers behave oddly. The ship's doors open and close of their own accord and Susan threatens Ian with a pair of scissors. Barbara suspects an alien intelligence is behind it all while the Doctor suspects Ian and Barbara of sabotage. Will they be able to solve the mystery in time before the TARDIS reaches the point of total disintegration? What made this story so good was the mystery and eerie atmosphere it creates. I give this one three stars.

You also get a 30-minute reconstructed version of the lost seven-part story ""Marco Polo"" which is included on the special features. The story is great and so was the reconstruction of it. I probably watch that one as much as the actual episodes themselves. This one gets four stars from me.

In all, this is truly epic and a must have for any Whovian. I also recommend this one to anyone who may just have a vage interest in the show. Once you've seen how it all began, you might like the show even more. Highly recommended!",1237766400,7,3759,4.434153400868307

William Hartnell (the first Doctor), sets the tone of the series and it is easy to see how generations of children and adults alike, have become avid followers.

2467369,4,B000CNESV2,"First, I want to make clear that untill I purchaesd this set I never actually saw this program before,I actually heard the theme song once and felt I had to see the show, so I would like to think that I might be more objective than some people. So, on with the review. First, for such an old program this has a solid look that still stands the test of time. Other than the models the special effects and especially the set work is sitll hold up even when compared wit hmoder effects. As I mentioned before only the models and the Daleks really show their age. But, that is not why this DVD set is a good buy. The primary reason that this set is so good is the casts performance. Compared with most shows that came out that period and even today the acting is quite good. It's not perfect but very solid and in most episodes is actually beleiveable. Now, the special features are ok but not great. I find that the music vedio is rather neat as are some of the comedy skits. But, most of the rest of the material will be of intrest only to those who would wish to make a study of Dr. Who. The only other complaint I had is that there wern't enough episodes I really would have liked to see at least one more. Other than that I recomend it to any one who likes old scifi or wants something that has a appeal to people of all ages.",1227398400,3,1327,4.107692307692307

In the interests of finding out where it all started I purchased a DVD set of the first Doctor Who stories.  I was not disappointed.  What has always fascinated me about the Doctor Who series is that all the stories are interrelated and each episode has at least one tidbit that serves to knit the tales together.  The question of why the Tardis always looks like a police call box is neatly answered in the original Doctor Who.  I love it!",1227052800,15,539,4.572916666666667

The first story ""An Unearthly Child"" unfolds over 4 episodes totally 95 minutes.  Two teachers are concerned about one of their students who appears to live in a junkyard.  When they attempt to visit her Grandfather, a doctor, they find a Police Box inside the junkyard.  After hearing her voice coming from inside the Box, they all end up inside and the Doctor takes off because he can't let them go after seeing the TARDIS.  They end up back in 200,000 b.c.

2467373,5,B000CNESV2,"Having watched only the new Doctor Who series (2005-2008 I think), I was worried this old production wouldn't compare, and largely it doesn't. That's not to say this is at all a waste of time, rather it seems so alien to my conceptions of the Doctor and TARDIS and Daleks that it was at first, a little off putting. As the intrepid Children of Time (two school teachers, and the doctors granddaughter) struggled to make fire in antediluvian earth I became concerned about the tone. Fortunately as soon as they had escaped the clutches of the cavemen, They encountered a dead and alien world. Terrifying at first, and even more so when the the first part of The Mutants ends climatically with an off screen foe brandishing an all too familiar plunger. From then on the show was Who through and through, and I loved it.
I even feel the old doctor bears an odd resemblance to a much older David Tennat, who is as it were MY Doctor. The whoniverse is born, and is a sight to behold. I heartily recommend this collection to any fan of RTD's newest incarnation.

2467378,5,B000CNESV2,"I was very happy to have purchased this collection... I just recently became a fan of the New Doctor and I have taken some time to watch some of the older series.  This 3 story run (story two giving us our first look at long time Doctor adversary The Dalek's) was a great introduction to this long running series.  And the character of the Doctor himself in this, his first incarnation.

Despite the relative contrived nature of the first story, the second and third made for it's simple plot with great zeal.  It was a good start for what has fastly become one of my favorite series.  Granted I have in no way seen all of it's episodes, or for that matter all of the incarnations of the Doctor. But of what I've seen so far has made me think The Doctor Who series is one of the most interesting and imaginative I've had the pleasure of catching.  And I hope to be a fan for a long time to come.

And as an avid television watcher and reader I can appreciate a good beginning... We all want to know how our favorite stories began.  And this is an aspect of that... Sure it doesn't tell us why The Doctor left his home and in fact much about him, but it does show us a Doctor Who whom is not exactly the Doctor we know.  A man who is not as happy to be among humans in the 20th century. Younger, in ways, more foolhardy and impetuous.  And at the same time Old and angry.

2467384,5,B000CNESV2,"... For this is the perfect way to start off a new series. They should have this everywhere. The first episode opens us at a careful pace into the Doctor's world, starting off with a mystery about a teenage girl, Susan Foreman.
I bought this in tribute to the late Verity Lambert, the producer who got Doctor Who on its feet (and was the only one to have faith in the Daleks, believe it or not.) Sadly, she died about a month ago. RIP.

I watched this as though I was watching a new program (helped by the fact that I had never seen any Hartnell episodes before this) and I can understand how viewers were drawn in... a machine that's bigger on the inside than on the outside... it can go anywhere... only vague answers to where they came from (unlike the untransmitted Pilot, where Susan says she's from the 44th century or something. I'm glad they didn't put that out.) You want to know what happens next, and it goes through most of the thirteen episodes.

I've heard that the subsequent three episodes of the first serial are awful to sit through, but I didn't find it hard at all. A bit reptitive, maybe, but not much. And, yes, the Doctor was about to kill Za with a rock! Shock! Horror! Outrage! Oh, wait, there is none. It's only outrage once he sprouts curly blonde hair and begins wearing a multi-coloured coat and yellow trousers. THEN it's unacceptable to vieweres.

But moving on. The Dalek story has more of an epic feel to it than most other serials. I was surprised to see Ian get hit with a Dalek ray and not get killed. Goes to show how far the Daleks have come, as later if you get hit with a ray, you're dead. No more warning. Not to mention that they can only move around in their city in this serial.

Finally, The Edge of Destruction. This is a character story, more than anything, as the production team suddenly found themselves with a 2 episode gap (they only started off with 13 episodes) with only the TARDIS set and the four characters to work with for a story due to zero budget. What? They don't have a budget? They have to... use their imagination? Why, what a novel concept! (rolls eyes). But here it is, they came up with a story, all right, and you're left with uncertainty through the whole thing. Due to an accident, neither The Doctor nor Susan are in their right mind through most of it, the TARDIS has broken, opening its doors to show just whiteness. Barbara and Ian (Barbara especially) come off well in this, as the four of them finally become a group of friends, rather than a team of misfits who were thrown together. The Doctor (I never thought of him as The First Doctor, just THE Doctor) accuses them of being behind the whole disaster of the ship and finally Barbara has had enough. She stands up to the Doctor, proving yet again that there were strong companions in the classic series, people are just too lazy to really notice. The story ends with them finding a snowy landscape and a giant footprint...

Enter Marco Polo. Sadly lost due to the BBC's idea of cutting costs by having programs ""wiped"" (taping over) it's presented as a 30 minute ""shortened"" version. Originally a 7 episode serial, by all accounts, a masterpiece (Lambert was especially saddened when she found that it was lost), this does at least gives a glimpse into it, and rounds off the set nicely, as there was no cliffhanger at the end, and you could say that those 20 episodes would've been enough of a series.

Then again, I'm even more happy they didn't stop there. So buy this DVD. Pop it into your seat, and get ready to go on, literally, the adventure of a lifetime...",1198627200,5,3597,4.4341906202723145

2467386,5,B000CNESV2,"On November 23, 1963, ""Doctor Who"" premiered on BBC TV, and science-fiction would never be the same. This three-disc DVD set contains the first thirteen episodes of this classic series, starring William Hartnell as the first incarnation of the Doctor.

AN UNEARTHLY CHILD (Episodes 1-4)
The first four-part serial is a fascinating - though very bizarre - beginning to the series. We are introduced to the Doctor, his granddaughter Susan, and schoolteachers Barbara and Ian. The first serial takes us to the time of the cavemen, and the supporting actors playing these early humans get to ham it up, though there are good performances among them. Still, this is a fine start to the series, with good performances, and fine storytelling.
Grade: B+

THE DALEKS (Episode 5-11)
The second serial was responsible for generating the show's success. And there's no need to wonder why: ""The Daleks"" is a fantastic seven-parter that starts off strong and never lets up. The cast and crew do a terrific job of bringing this story to life. The Daleks themselves are very sinister, and are the one creation that would give the show a life, and the reason that the show would last twenty-five more seasons. Terrific entertainment!
Grade: A

THE EDGE OF DESTRUCTION (Episodes 12-13)
Rounding out the thirteen episodes is the two-part serial ""The Edge of Destruction,"" which has the distinction of being the only serial to take place entirely inside the Tardis. The four principles do a terrific job, and the story is descent, though a little bland. Still, this two-parter is responsible for bringing the characters to where they would be for the rest of the time they would be together, and is very memorable for that.
Grade: B

CONCLUSION:
One of the things fans will notice about these first episodes is that the Doctor is not trustworthy at first, pretty much ""kidnapping"" the two schoolteachers. However, by the end of these first thirteen episodes, he grows to trust Ian and Barbara, and becomes the trustworthy, crochety old  man we'd grow to love as the 1st Doctor. The DVD set features terrific picture and sound, as well as great bonus features. Overall, this is a terrific set that belongs in everyone's ""Doctor Who"" collection.

2467389,5,B000CNESV2,"Those of you familiar with my reviews know that I am not too keen on DVD extras, an excuse to jack up the price of the DVD.  However, Doctor Who The Beginning Collection contains two extras that, frankly speaking, are reason enough to buy this DVD set.  The three stories featured here, Unearthly Child, The Daleks, and Edge of Destruction, are FIVE-Star stories themselves. However, there is nothing new offered as all three have been released on VHS, and enough has been written about those, so I won't ramble on about them.  Great stories nonetheless.

The first of the two fantastic extras is a 55-minute documentary called Doctor Who Origins.  It details the story of how our favorite tv show about our favorite time lord was conceived, featuring snippets of interviews with not only the surviving starring cast, William Russell and Carole Ann Ford, but also the original behind the scenes team of Producer Verity Lambert and Director Waris Hussein.  Also interviewed for this special presentation was the creator of Doctor Who himself, Sidney Newman.  We also get some great still shots of Doctor Who in production, as well as movie reels of Grandstand and Juke Box Jury, the two programs that sandwiched Doctor Who when it was first broadcast.  To top it off, this documentary contains footage of Ron Grainer and Delia Derbyshire, who composed the eerie Doctor Who theme music, hard at work at the now defunct Radiophonic Workshop.

The second great extra in this collection is the 30-minute montage of stills and soundtrack to form the story, Marco Polo, which due to the BBC's lack of vision and foresight, has been lost forever.  From all accounts, this story was a classic.  Taking place over a span of several months gave Marco Polo an epic feel.  While the full story is likely never to be regained, this condensed version provides us with a glimpse of its greatness.

In conclusion, the three featured stories are the reason to purchase this DVD set.  However, the two extras I discussed justify their own separate release and heavily enhance this set.",1178409600,13,2066,4.882521489971347

2467403,5,B000CNESV2,"Well, folks, it all starts here. What does? First of all, and most importantly, the ""Doctor Who"" TV series, of course. This DVD set includes the first three storylines (along with a valiant reconstruction of what's left of the fourth) that launched this exceptionally long-lived classic sci-fi series beloved by so many over the years. It's almost as good as having a fast return switch to 1963. Second of all, my own rediscovery of the show was sparked by my utter and thorough enjoyment of these stories. Back in junior high and high school I watched the show with an almost religious fervor and was a rather hardcore fan, but as time went on and my local PBS stopped broadcasting the show and such, I slowly drifted away while retaining a fond memory of the show's place in my youth. Still, back in the heyday of my enthusiasm the chance to see the very earliest episodes was a distant, unfulfilled dream--so when I chanced to see this DVD set recently, I decided to finally scratch that itch and leave it at that. So much for plan A. Now I'm stuck, hooked anew. Anyway, the point of this longwinded autobiographical digression is simply this, these DVDs are so excellent they have even the power to bring delinquent fair-weather fans back to the fold.

In many ways, the main premise of the show and many of its primary characteristics are firmly established right here at the point of origin. The concept of wandering in both space and time, an almost infinitely open-ended idea allowing for decades of development, is present and accounted for; the alternation between a ""historical"" storyline set at some intriguing point in Earth's past (""An Unearthly Child"" with its trip to human prehistory and the discovery of fire) and an ""alien"" storyline set on some other distant planet (""The Daleks"" with its journey to the radiation-blighted planet of Skaro) sets the tone and the rhythm of ""Doctor Who"" indelibly. And while some aspects of the mythological contours of the Doctor's character are still fuzzy in these early episodes, William Hartnell's rendition of an enigmatic, eccentric outsider with a mysterious past wandering the space-time continuum haphazardly in a vehicle that never quite functions properly is simply classic. His short temper, brusque arrogance, and alien ethical sense are tempered just right by a heart of gold and a grandfatherly paternalism. And the perfect foil for such a character is found in the Daleks: impersonal, coldly utilitarian, ruthlessly efficient, mechanized mutants with hearts of steel, as xenophobic of the unknown as the Doctor is enthralled by it. An archetypal contrast that speaks to our own ambiguous attitudes to a modern, technological world we have created and are stuck with. The Doctor is a loner who never travels alone, which also gets its start here, only what was later an almost unquestioned formula is here at the beginning a natural, organic part of the plot, replete with a very real sense of tension and conflict. Much of the latter pretty much comes to a head and is resolved in ""The Edge of Destruction""--but this psychologically intense paranoid trip is interesting in its own right for the very reason that the relationships between the characters were not yet taken for granted.

In passing, let me add that I'm usually not one for special features on DVDs; I'm not dead-set against them, but I tend to benignly ignore them since I just want to watch the show. However, the documentaries on the early conceptualization and formation of the series and the making of the first episodes (including the construction and handling of the Daleks) was immensely interesting to me. The ingenuity and inventive know-how that went into everything, even down to the weird, futuristic theme song (weirder and more futuristic in 1963, of course), is simply amazing. It's so much easier to do it all on a computer today, but so much more enthralling to see how it was done by dedicated people back in the predigital days. And it's their dedication along with that of the writers and actors and the whole crew that shows through in every single moment of these incredible episodes and ensured the longevity of the renegade Time Lord's ongoing saga.",1170028800,8,4206,4.914205344585091

2467409,5,B000CNESV2,"It's nice to rave about something for once.

It's sad that many Doctor Who fans have never been exposed to the joys of the early series.  Yes, they are in black and white and the production values leave something to be desired.  But the good scripts, the wonderful acting and the glorious sense of atmosphere overcome all obstacles, including the penny-pinching BBC.  William Hartnell is one of the best men to ever play the Doctor, bringing irrascibility, tetchiness . . . and, toward the end, grace and charm.  It's a pity he only lasted three years.

It's amazing that these episodes can still captivate after 43 years.  But they do.  An Unearthly Child is a decent lead-in. The pilot episode is the best, with the creepy atmosphere of the Foreman yard and Hartnell's disturbing portrayal.  This is followed by the Daleks, the serial that made the series.  The last episodes drag a bit, but parts of it are incredibly taught.  And the Daleks are still chilling four decades after their debut.  Edge of Destruction has its weaknesses but the mood and tone are marvelous.  And it's great to see the Doctor transform from a suspicious anti-hero to a gentle and charming lead.

I must say, the marvelous Reconstruction crew has gone all-out.  The video and audio are beautiful -- better than they were in 1963.  Text commentaries and a one-hour Doc tell you everything about how your favorite show got started.  It's amazing what was done on a shoestring budget, a hectic schedule, no post-production and the worst studio in Britain.  The cast and crew commentaries are, for once, excellent.  Gary Russell drives the discussion and illuminates the frenzied conditions under which the episodes were made.

On sale from Amazon, this collection is dirt cheap -- far cheaper than you would get for the same series as some dusty old video.  Don't hesitate.",1162166400,6,1850,4.84664536741214
2467410,5,B000CNESV2,"I was truly impressed with the picture and sound quality of the 43 year old episodes included in this 3 disc set.  I had never seen any of the William Hartnell episodes (my first exposure to the Doctor was during the Jon Pertwee years) and I was pleasantly surprised at what a charming, not to mention curmudgeonly, Doctor that he made.  The first episode of ""The Unearthly Child"" is excellent and though the subsequent episodes in that storyline tend to drag a bit, the first episode makes owning this set worthwhile.  Not only that, but you also get to view the unaired pilot (pay careful attention to the subtle dialogue differences).

The second disc contains the 7 part story ""The Daleks"" that introduces TV viewers to one of the Doctor's most well known foes. Once again, there are some scenes that are a bit slow, but overall the storytelling is so compelling and the performances so much fun, that I would classify it as a Doctor Who ""must-see.""

There are some wonderful extras included, my favorite I think has to be the ""reconstructed"" lost episode ""Marco Polo.""  Even though the reconstruction is created with still pictures, you do get the original audio soundtrack which makes you feel like you are actually seeing an episode of the show.  This is definitely a set worth owning and has me looking forward to the release of more William Hartnell Doctor Who episodes.",1156982400,4,1379,4.7447698744769875
2467411,5,B000CNESV2,"The Beginning Collection of Doctor Who is the series of video episodes that started it all, and what a start!  William Hartnel is so wonderfully grouchy as the Doctor, and Susan is so sweet!  Plus, the invention of the Doctor's most enduring villains, the Daleks, is a stroke of pute genius (even if they are scientifically and tactically improbable).

Though these episodes are many, many years old, and the sets and f/x cheap, the shows hold up as ""stories"", and there is depth and heart in every relationship.  For anyone watching the newer episodes, you should really grab this set and understand where the whole thing came from.  It is necessary.",1155513600,3,651,4.828828828828829
2467412,5,B000CNESV2,"Doctor Who: The Beginning has three full stories, An Unearthly Child, The Daleks and The Edge of Destruction.  It also had, in the form of tele-snaps and surviving audio soundtracks, a condensed version of the lost seven-part story Marco Polo.

I have done a review of The Daleks VHS tape, so I will focus on the other stories.  First, the An Unearthly Child is two plots shoved into one story.  The first plot is how two teachers, Ian and Barbara, first meet the Doctor and Susan.  The second plot is the first adventure which is set in the past, showing that the TARDIS can travel in time and space.

The Edge of Destruction is a story that allows the characters to become more developed by putting them under the pressure of an unknown danger and also helps us come to understand the workings of the TARDIS.  It was a two episode story which was also meant to help them save money for the bigger seven episode story, Marco Polo.

Marco Polo, in its full glory, must have been a grand adventures, very much like the seven episode with the Daleks and I am sad that it is no longer available for future generations.  I'm sad that I never got to see it outside of the 30 minute version.

Besides audio commentary for many (but not all of the episodes) there are tons of extras, such as photo galleries, behind-the-scene features, fan specials, and there is also the first pilot episode, which was never shown and had to be remade.  They even have clips from the adventures of the Ninth Doctor. The production note option gives lots of details about special effects, cost, story changes, studio work, the actors and crew.

With three discs, the first three stories of Dr. WHO (four if you count Marco Polo) and all the extras this set is worth getting new.",1153612800,4,1754,4.515822784810126
2467413,4,B000CNESV2,"I only recently became a Doctor Who fan, through the Christopher Eccleston episodes that have been airing on SciFi Channel.  I bought these DVDs to see where the series began, and this review is written with people like myself in mind -- in other words, people who enjoy the recent episodes, but may not know anything else aboutthe show's history.

Personally, I was not disappointed.  Obviously, over forty years stand between the current Doctor and the original Doctor, and in that time, the series appears to have changed quite a lot.  However, these original episodes, considering that they appear to have had as tiny a budget as a show can possibly have, are entertaining, and will make you think.

""An Unearthly Child,"" the beginning story, is the lesser of the three, featuring an odd story about cavemen who are trying to figure out how to make fire.  It's not bad, especially the very first episode, which is all about how the characters get stuck with the Doctor . . . but the cavemen are a bit silly.

""The Daleks"" introduces the series' (apparently) major villains; it's a very good serial, with some strong morality play and character interaction that is far superior to that of most TV shows (sci-fi or not) from this era.

""The Edge of Destruction"" is a two-parter that makes very effective use of the TARDIS.

There are several excellent bonus features, as well, including an hour-long documentary about the show's creation; some funny comedy bits from the BBC; and an audio recreation of a storyline (""Marco Polo"") for which the episdoes have been lost.

In short, if you are a fan of the new Who, then I think you'll probably also dig these DVDs.",1148947200,21,1664,4.746527777777778
2467414,5,B000CNESV2,"With Doctor Who back on our screens after a long rest, it's highly appropriate that BBC Video have taken the opportunity to remind everyone where it all started with this DVD package. However, if you've fallen under the spell of Christopher Eccleston & David Tennant's portrayals of the mysterious Time Lord in the new adventures, you may find the roots of the long running show a little bit on the dull side! It certainly serves as a reminder as to how TV production has changed in forty plus years!

The Beginning Collection takes us all the way back to November 1963 when Doctor Who first aired on Britain's BBC TV in its traditional Saturday evening slot. This set of three discs (in two cases) brings the first four stories from the show's forty-two year history back to life and explains the origins of the format that led to the world's longest running sci-fi TV show.

Not that it was all sci-fi based. The first story - An Unearthly Child aka The Tribe of Gum otherwise aka 100,000 BC - features the original crew of the TARDIS going back into ancient Earth history to deal with a tribe of cavemen desperate to rediscover the secret of fire. But that was always the intention of the show; to educate as well as to entertain and for the first four years of it's life, the stories regularly took the time travelers back in time as well as way into the future and into other worlds. The second story - The Daleks aka The Mutants - was the first story to be set in outer space on an alien world and was the kick start to the ratings phenomena that lasted for twenty six years; introducing the evil Dalek race who in many ways became as popular in their own right as the Doctor himself. The third installment is the two part adventure featuring only the original four-handed cast and set entirely within the Doctor's space and time machine - The TARDIS - variously known as Inside the Spaceship, The Edge of Destruction and Beyond the Sun. Alas, the fourth installment in the show's history, an adventure featuring Marco Polo's trek across Cathay, has long been wiped from the video archives. Thankfully, the soundtrack still exists, as do many still photographs, and the disc producers have put together a montage of the two to recreate a thirty minute version of the story on these discs. In view of the systematic wiping of tapes carried out by the BBC in the 1970's, this recreation is probably the closest we'll ever come to the real thing.

Indeed, as almost always with the Doctor Who releases, it's the extras and the restoration work that makes these discs so worthwhile. The two surviving members of the original cast, Carole Ann Ford and William Russell Enoch (who played the Doctor's grand-daughter Susan and her science teacher Ian Chesterton) both have come together once more to provide fascinating commentary on several of the episodes, along with the show's original producer Verity Lambert and directors' Waris Hussein, Christopher Barry and Richard Martin. Despite how long ago it all took place, their memories are quite sharp and very clear, although they only commentate on selected episodes, thus avoiding any embarrassing silence as the thoughts dry up! There are several documentaries regarding the creation of the show, the original design elements, music, special sound and effects and some comedy sketches from the Little Britain team to enjoy amongst many other special inclusions. Also added is an Arabic soundtrack of episode two of the third story!

Possibly the most interesting `extra' is the inclusion not just of the pilot episode of the show, but also the alternative takes that all miraculously still exist. More than anything, this exceptional look at what `might have been' gives real insight into the creation of Doctor Who and how it developed before being broadcast to the unsuspecting UK audience. The pilot is actually included twice on the disc. Immediately preceding episode one in its `final' format and again separately in its first take with all the alternative filming, narrated by Verity Lambert and Waris Hussein. Overkill perhaps, but worth it for the fans. It's true that all the episodes (including the pilots) have been released on VHS tape in the last decade or so, but here they been meticulously restored, remastered and ""VidFired"" to bring them back to almost original broadcast quality. Some of the footage in The Daleks isn't quite up to the standard of the other episodes, but that's understandable based on the quality of the remaining tapes.

Just as Christopher Eccleston brings the ninth Doctor to life on US TV and David Tennant begins his reign as the tenth in the UK, it's great to see William Hartnell's original Doctor making its first tentative steps into the TV world. As noted in the commentaries, Hartnell was almost alone in having enormous faith in the show, believing it would run for five years. How wrong can you be?",1144454400,22,4902,4.817102137767221
2467415,5,B000CNESV2,"I would like to see ALL Doctor Whos released(minas the 1970's vendetta distructo totalitarianio el nino bastardo pyro my fat cousin burns tapes of course).  I would like to see them released in order from start to finish(Hartnel to Esleston + #10 who ever).  This is a good way if your too cheap to buy the whole set of a season.  The three here are two full stories and a short story(Edge of Distruction).  I would release in threes and twelves for us who want to get that collective going before we turn 912. right now(as since 1984) Doctor Who releases have been molassus slow I am, to be frank, sick of waiting.  Some people like Daleks some like Time Meddler some don't like anything but Tom, I think everyone should see what they like.  I like Meglos, Nimon, and Curses Heladon(eh Peladon) does that count for anything at ('tall) all?  Why not release Master Plan(in entirety) in a single DVD set alone.  E-space Trilogy and Regenpratoion trilogy in a epoch or a two-fer-one, watevea!  The flow of continuety has never been as good as the six story ordeal of C V E.

The beginning is a good title for this trilogy(Begining Tri)  Hartnel has never been better(The Daleks is a moving story and he is incredible as the deepest thinking of all Doctors Who).  I hope we get a follow up before I hit 40 and I hope Pat Throughton's epich regenoration first story is uncovered from the pyromaniacs who distroyed it in thier ferinehiet 451 mentality of conscieous thinking.",1143849600,7,1470,4.590038314176245
2467416,5,B000CNESV2,"Most who buy this set will do so because they are, after all, the first three stories of this series, and classics for that fact alone more than the actual content. Others have said a great deal about the stories themselves better than I might, so all I'll add is that the one of the great triumphs of this set is the brilliant work done by the BBC Restoration Team (VidFIRE is just amazing). I've never seen these stories look and sound so clean before; in fact, I don't think I've ever seen a video production (vs film) from this time period look so good.

But the real hidden treasures on these discs are the EXTRAS. There are hours of specials and interviews in this set that dig into the origins of the series and these stories in a way that has only been done before in books by the likes of Jeremy Bentham, Howe-Stammers-Walker and so on. Of particular note is the absolutely fantastic and engrossing special, ""Doctor Who Origins"". Steve Roberts is to be commended for this unprecedented look behind the the scenes at the year leading up to the production of the first serials. The absolute wealth of photos, footage, BBC memoes and interviews that exist in this special alone are worth the price of the entire set. I've loved and followed this show since the 70s, but this was the first time I felt that I'd really been taken back to 1962-63 and given a glimpse of the wonderful people and unsung heroes that brought this show to our screens. This special was almost immersive, and had me at times giggling like a child, feeling a chill up my spine, and at one or two points almost tearing up. It's not just a DVD extra, it's a historical archive, and I feel so fortunate to have it as a permanent addition to my library. Attentive viewers will also see a remarkable amount of similarity to the choices made in the original series, and the new series now about to begin its second season.

Another extra is a wonderful 5.1 remix ""music video"" of the original Doctor Who theme by Ron Granier as realised by Delia Derbyshire and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The theme has never sounded so good, and kudos to Mark Ayres for breathing new life into this immortal theme tune once again. There's also a wonderful special -- ""Masters of Sound"" -- on the Radiophonic Workshop itself, which did so much in terms of sound effects and music for DW over the years. Again, a real historical document, and brilliantly written and directed.

Scattered throughout the extras are interviews with and great insights from those who were there: Verity Lambert (who steals my heart when I see her at the age of 27!), Sydney Newman, directors Waris Hussein (who is a delight to listen to) and Richard Martin, and of course actors Carole Ann Ford (Susan) and William Russell (Ian). I'm sure all of these people must have tired over the years of talking about the show, but you'd never know it watching this. I'm amazed everyones' memories are so sharp 43 years later!

One disc has a set of very funny comedy sketches, including a few with actor/writer (DW and ""League of Gentlemen"") Mark Gatiss. Do not miss the hilarious ""The Pitch of Fear"" and ""The Kidnappers""!

There's even a audio/still photo recreation of the story ""Marco Polo"", one of the sadly ""lost"" episodes of DW. So you're not just getting 3 stories plus extras; more like 4 stories plus history! This release, possibly more than anything else in my collection, is what the DVD format is all about. It will be a hard one for BBC Video and the Restoration Team to ever top.",1143849600,26,3522,4.5664556962025316
2467417,5,B000CNESV2,"This is what started it on flickering boob tubes across the UK on 23 November 1963.

100,000 BC: The first epsisode ('An Unearthly Child' sets the mark for the series, however you have to say something about the remainder as well. The psychological drama works OK and the fact that the Doctor and his human companions have to start working together, despite their fear and distrust of one another.

The Mutants (AKA The Daleks, AKA The Dead Planet): My favourite Dalek story. Great atmosphere, like when Alydon is 'chasing' Susan in the forest and the hunt for the Fluid Link. Despite some padding of later episodes, it stands up well even in 2006.

Inside the Spaceship (AKA The Edge of Destruction): 2 episodes, entirely within the TARDIS? How can it be done? David Whitaker showed it COULD be done and make great TV drama at the same time. The old suspicions of alien versus human are re-introduced and it's just superb television of the kind I wish they still made today. Sadly, writing has gone to the wayside nowadays. No current TV show could survive with what Dr. Who had to deal with in late 1963 and early 1964.

Also, this is coming out after 42 years, not 40 as another reviewer wrote. 42 years and it is still going strong (new series with Christopher Eccleston is a must see, IMO)",1141776000,15,1294,4.588744588744588
2467418,5,B000CNESV2,"I have the UK Region 2 version of this boxset and I see no difference in content in the Region 1 version. The contents of the set are as advertised and they are a must for every Doctor Who fan. I would start watching the DVDs with the uncut version of the Pilot Episode. Apart from being a look at how British television production  worked in the early 1960s it gives an insight to the problems and tribulations involved in the making of a new, different type of program for children.

There is a 25 minute cut version of the origional pilot episode which is interesting when compared with the refilmed version which was origionally aired in 1963. The following episodes of An Unearthly Child are about their first adventure with the cave dwellers. A little hard to watch these days when we are spoilt with visual effects and superbs sound. They are however historically interesting as they show how the Doctor and his companions are developed. There has been a lot of critisism of the character of Susan Foreman as the Doctor's niece, but I think she was essential to the programs success.

The second disc is a must! The first look at the Daleks. Yes its true we did hide behind the chairs when the daleks came on, and I had numerous dreams about saving the earth from the Daleks. We even ran around the playground being Daleks.

The third disc The Edge of Destruction is one for the adults. It gives an insight into the importance of the TARDIS and its secret hidden powers. You 'MUST' watch this before you see the new Doctor Who series.",1141430400,12,1541,4.512544802867383
2467419,4,B000CNESV2,"It's amazing that these episodes exist given the fact that many early episodes were ""lost"" or destroyed. The very FIRST three episodes of the series all in one DVD set is a great way for new and established fans alike to see how the series and the story of The Doctor got started.

Episodes on this set are ""An Unearthly Child,"" ""The Daleks,"" and ""The Edge of Destruction."" As the second episode introduces one of the funniest, cheesiest and most famous TV villains of all time, the Daleks, this set also allows fans to see how this regular foe of the Doctor was first introduced. Dr. Who was always a low-budget show and it really shows in the early episodes, which are often among the slowest moving in plot and action. Nevertheless, this set is a great way to see how one of the longest running TV series in history first began and the show is very ""kid friendly"" so you can enjoy watching this set as a family activity, that is, for those fans who are not such terrible nerds that they've actually been able to find a mate and have kids :-). All kidding aside, Doctor Who was considered a children's program when it began in the UK in 1963, but when it was introduced to the US audience through PBS back in the 1970's it acquired a huge adult fan base. This fact has not been lost on the writers of The Simpsons, who have made fun of this fact many times, usually through their ""Comic Book Guy"" character. But I digress.

If you're a huge fan of The Doctor or even if you're a more casual fan who has always wanted to see the original story arcs introducing the character and establishing the series, this set is for you. Let's all say it in celebration of this set's release: ""exterminate, exterminate!""",1141257600,8,1708,4.419047619047619
2467420,4,B000CNESV2,"For those of you who may be considering buying this DVD set as the obvious introduction to ""Doctor Who"" but don't necessarily know much about it, here is some background to the series (those of you in the know can skip this if you want).

Made by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), ""Doctor Who"" is the world's longest-running science-fiction TV show, beginning in November 1963 and initially running until December 1989 when the show appeared to run out of both steam and significant viewing figures. A large and loyal global fan base kept the Doctor `alive' however through various alternative medias (such as books, audio CDs and video cassettes) until the triumphant return of the show to television in 2005 where it has once again become one of the BBC's most important, most talked about and most watched TV shows.

Although the program is called ""Doctor Who"", the main character is consistently known only as ""The Doctor"" (""Doctor Who"" being nothing more than a simple reference to the mysterious lead character). Some of the mysteries surrounding the Doctor are revealed throughout the course of the series when it is established he is part of a race known as The Time Lords from the planet Gallifrey.

At one point in the show's history, it is suggested that the Doctor was bored with merely observing time and space on Gallifrey and decided to ""borrow"" a TARDIS (which stands for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space) to explore the universe, taking his granddaughter, Susan with him. A TARDIS is a `capsule' engineered by the Time Lords with the ability to travel anywhere in time and space. Its interior is larger than its exterior because it is ""dimensionally transcendental"". Upon materializing, the exterior of a TARDIS normally blends in with its surroundings to `camouflage' itself. However, the Doctor's TARDIS has a fault in its `chameleon circuit' and so constantly appears as a 1960's British police telephone box, a fault that presumably occurs when the TARDIS leaves 1960's London at the end of the first episode of the very first story, ""An Unearthly Child"". The Doctor was originally played by William Hartnell but declining health forced him to give up the part after three years and he was replaced by Patrick Troughton. Thus, further ""Who"" folklore was established by introducing the concept of regeneration - a Time Lord's ability to ""cheat death"" by ""renewing"" all the cells in his body leaving him with a completely different physical make-up and personality. This ingenious idea enabled the show to continue without Hartnell and beyond Troughton, making the show somewhat unique in the sense that it is now almost expected to change its leading actor every once in a while.

The first three stories presented here in this DVD set show William Hartnell initially portraying the Doctor as something of an anti-hero. He is suspicious, cunning, patronizing and manipulative. In some cases we learn this is to protect his granddaughter Susan or simply to satisfy his own curiosity. Hartnell is in fine form as the mysterious time traveler, displaying some good alien qualities, particularly in the first story, ""An Unearthly Child"" in which he shows no sympathy to the plight of two London school teachers, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, whom he feels he must `kidnap' to ensure his presence on earth is kept secret. Indeed, good acting performances are given from the entire main cast in these first three stories. Unfortunately, the captivating other-world qualities displayed by Susan (played by Carole Ann Ford) in the first couple of episodes of ""An Unearthly Child"" quickly evaporate and from then on she is reduced to playing a clichd, whimpering, nave teenage girl.

The epic second story, ""The Daleks"" turned the initial success of ""Doctor Who"" into a phenomenon almost overnight. Indeed, this story and it's follow-up, ""The Dalek Invasion Of Earth"" would later be made in color for the big-screen in two modestly successful films starring Peter Cushing as the Time Lord. ""The Daleks"" introduces the Doctor's now most famous nemesis on their home planet of Skaro, thousands of years after their war with a blonde-haired race called the Thals. The peaceful Thals live on the surface of Skaro while the emotionless Daleks are mutants who have survived only with the aid of mobile metal casings, confined to within a large city, their battle cry of ""Exterminate! Exterminate!"" now being a phrase cemented in British popular culture and mimicked in every school yard throughout the past 43 years. After more anti-hero displays from the Doctor at the beginning of this story, the Time Lord actually starts to show signs of a more friendly nature as ""The Daleks"" progresses.

However, he still retains enough mistrust to accuse Ian and Barbara of tampering with the TARDIS when, in the third story, ""The Edge Of Destruction"", a number of bizarre things start to happen to jeopardize the lives of all four time travelers. ""The Edge Of Destruction"" is a two-part story that simply acted as something of a ""filler"" to restrain budget costs and hence takes place completely within the confines of the TARDIS. The bizarre happenings prove to be a result of the TARDIS's warning system to its occupants that the ship is hurtling back in time to the beginning of the universe. The reason for this is actually rather ludicrous - a faulty spring in the TARDIS's control console being responsible for the near catastrophy! The theme of the TARDIS being an almost ""living"" entity within itself and capable of warning its inhabitants of potential danger is an interesting one but one that was sadly never really explored again until the new series in 2005. By the end of this story the Doctor actually comes very close to apologizing to Ian and Barbara for his behaviour and from now on the Doctor becomes a much more friendly and approachable character, although one that still maintains a temper when he wants to.

Sadly, the fourth ""Doctor Who"" story, ""Marco Polo"" is believed to be no longer in existence, all seven episodes being wiped by the BBC in the 1970's when it was customary to purge old shows once copies had been shipped to foreign TV companies and before home marketing possibilities were made available. However, the audio soundtrack for this story still exists, as do some off-screen telesnap photographs for all but one of the episodes. Presented on this DVD set is a condensed version of ""Marco Polo"" using the available soundtrack and telesnaps.

All in all this DVD set shows that ""Doctor Who"" got off to a compelling start with intelligent writing and some noteworthy acting performances and directing. With over 4 hours of bonus material. it is well worth a buy for good entertainment value to watch and enjoy over again.",1141084800,153,6776,4.979681978798586
2467421,5,B000CNESV2,"The announcement of this set could be a very good sign for Doctor Who lovers.  Finally, a reasonably priced set of three complete stories in one package has been packaged by the BBC.  For some reason, the BBC seems to have thought Doctor Who fans in the USA have very deep pockets as previous releases have been extremely stingy and grossly overpriced!

Isn't it odd that a program about a Time Lord should have addition appeal due to the age of the television program? The sets are primitive as are the proto-special effects, but this is the charm of all Doctor Who's that pre-date ILM's ""Star Wars"" beauty. Seeing these older Doctor Who programs again is indeed peering back in time. Who would have guessed it would be like this back in 1963?

having watched them all, I do disagree.
while I admit the first episode of an unearthly child is by far the best of the story, the cavemen side of it isn't bad.
the daleks doesn't drag to me, but holds my attention, and I see a logical development of character in ian and Barbara.  it deserves to be regarded as iconic.
the edge of destruction is very underrated to me.  it's a character driven story, more than anything else. but the hysteria and fright that the characters  undergo when being in the TARDIS feels like a precursor to legendary episodes in New Who like 'Midnight'.
as long as you go into classic who understanding that the pacing is slower, and that it's more about the tension that the show causes to the characters, then you will love this collection.  a very good intro to the show!  three very good episodes",1508803200,,1109,4.5376884422110555
