8271865,4,B00194D2SI,"I have been a childbirth educator for 30 years.  Seen my share of birth movies.  This one is a favorite because it is about 18 minutes long and features women birthing under several different circumstances.  I like that it shows the unexpected and how interventions can be used in a positive way to help a woman have a good birth memory.  The first birth the woman had planned an epidural and then had a change of plans when labor went quicker than expected.  She has a very encouraging nurse but not so encouraging doctor.  Even though she did not get the birth she planned she speaks very positively about her feelings of empowerment after the birth.  The second woman is planning a VBAC and after a very challenging and exhuasting labor elects an epidural that she did not want.  She discusses how she feels the epidural allowed her to go on and give birth vaginally and avoid a repeat cesarean.  The third woman has amazing support from her partner and midwives, a rather quick labor for a first time mom and larger baby.  She makes sounds during labor and talks about how that helped her move through it.  Overall a good movie to show in class.  For me even a negative movie can be educational.  This is great for childbirth educators and even doula and it is reasonably priced.",1348531200,,1283,4.550218340611353

The idea behind this DVD is to not be too attached to having things go 100% the way you have planed. They are all vaginal births. One with an epidural, two without. They all take place in a hospital setting either with a midwife or doctor. I recommend this one.",1299888000,,426,4.083333333333333
8271867,5,B00194D2SI,"This program features real couples having to cope with real choices during labor. The goal of the program is to demonstrate that, no matter how well you may plan your delivery, they don't always go as planned. It is not about life and death birth complications, but rather it focuses on staying flexible and open to all your options.

The program is structured into three birth stories, each featuring a different family. Each story runs 8 to 10 minutes long and is a complete story arc, from the onset of labor to final delivery of the baby. The producers clearly know what they're doing as the camera work and editing are first rate. The families and emotions ring true and you will find the moments of birth to be emotionally elevating. Highly recommended.",1210204800,6,759,4.706766917293233
