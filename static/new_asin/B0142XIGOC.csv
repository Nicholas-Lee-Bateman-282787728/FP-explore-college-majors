7382874,3,B0142XIGOC,"Have been a fan of Nazareth since the beginning. Seen them 7 times, met them after a show at the Madison Theatre, May 6, 1993 ,Peoria Illinois. Had a few beers with them, swapped stories, took pictures with them got autographs of course. My wife Patsy and I met alot of bands through the years and Nazareth was one of the kindest and most friendly.. Watching this dvd actually made me cry. The interview with Dan McCafferty is what did it. It had to be cut short because Dan became emotional talking about the loss of there drummer Darrell Sweet. Dan had to retire because of lack of breath when trying to sing. He is and will always be the Voice of Nazareth! I have to say to Pete Agnew, who signed our poster, "" For Charlie and Patsy, Rock On!! Its time brother, its time. Love you!",1451433600,8,784,4.304054054054054

8729505,5,B0142XIGOC,"Great performance by Nazareth, I would say there were maybe 100 people in the audience only.  The Music was crisp and sounded great, the Video was great also.  For a band that's been knocking it around for over 40 years they can still get it done, True Nazareth fans will enjoy this Dan McCafferty can not perform anymore but he is included in the Documentary which is also fantastic.",1465689600,,384,4.550724637681159
8729506,3,B0142XIGOC,"It's important to the band's final history that fans have an official recording of the brief Linton Osbourne era. A brief recap - after advancing COPD forced the legendary Dan McCafferty into retirement, the band drafted Osbourne, a fellow Scot, for the unenviable task of replacing the irreplaceable. After some European live work and a Canadian tour, Osbourne left the band after a little more than a year in the gig and Nazareth replaced him with Persian Risk vocalist Carl Sentance.

Osbourne is a fine rock singer and acquits himself admirably on much of the classic Nazareth material. He has a little less of McCafferty's bluesy gravitas than what longtime Nazareth fans might like, but his upbeat stage presence and powerful voice were good for the band. Since Osbourne appeared on no new album, No Means of Escape will most likely end up the only official release document of his time in the band. Regarding the overall quality of the performance, it depends on what you are looking for. If you are a casual fan of the band, you will likely be pleased by the band's reliably professional performance and their near note perfect renditions of classic songs. If you are a devotee of the band, you will appreciate the set list, but may find the arrangements and playing a little stale. The picture and audio quality are superb.

The documentary is worth the price of the package alone for a longtime Nazareth fan.",1464825600,,1418,4.807377049180328

8729508,5,B0142XIGOC,"Great audio and video on this disc, with classic riff-laden rocking songs.  It's not the original singer, but the spirit is there.",1457136000,,130,4.909090909090909
8729509,1,B0142XIGOC,"I kind of bought this one just for the name and picture thinking that having being authorized by the band that it will be a great DVD.  Well, the interviews with original members are great, but the performances of new lineup are plain flat, there is no emotion in the new members' performances.  It's like seeing someone rehearsing in a garage on a typical afternoon of having nothing else to do.  I wish I have read anything prior to ordering it.",1455580800,,447,4.493827160493828
