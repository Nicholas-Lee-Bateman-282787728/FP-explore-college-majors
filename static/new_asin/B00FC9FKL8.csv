5975227,4,B00FC9FKL8,I have only tried Tape One and found it to be challenging but not over taxing. I definitely felt the work out in my arms. I look forward to trying the other tapes,1390003200,8,162,3.9393939393939394
5975228,5,B00FC9FKL8,"This DVD set is incredible.  It's one of the best workouts I've ever had in my entire life.  People are only giving it bad ratings because it looks brand new, but is just a re-issue of an older version.  This is an excellent series for anyone interested in the Tracy Anderson Method.",1428192000,4,283,4.403846153846154
5975229,1,B00FC9FKL8,boring. She doesn't speak while she takes you through the work out then goes back and narrates it. I could only suffer through the workouts once before I gave the set away,1421712000,2,171,4.375

5975233,5,B00FC9FKL8,I tried to do the beginners DVD and realized I'm not in good enough shape for that but I will say I can see how this program will work. I recommend starting w/ the intro to the method before starting this.,1397692800,,205,4.024390243902439
5975234,4,B00FC9FKL8,A little hard to follow her arm moves. I do love how she targets the small muscles that are usually neglected!,1394928000,4,110,4.285714285714286

5975236,2,B00FC9FKL8,"I should have read more of the other reviews about this set.  While it is still worth viewing........for me, it was not worth the purchase. Mainly because even though the date of the dvd was 2013, it wasn't newly taped workouts and unlike it was unlike Tracy Anderson: Precision Toning (2013) + Method for Beginners (2013), there are no instructions.  So you have to watch it a few times to get the hang of her movements which is frustrating.
Now this is not to say that her workouts aren't worth it.............but you have to be really familiar with her movements to follow this properly.",1392681600,8,590,4.663461538461538
5975237,1,B00FC9FKL8,"This is a very old series that has been repackaged.  She is very annoying in this series.  She never smiles, the instruction is all VoiceOver.  It is a poorly done video.",1391990400,3,170,4.419354838709677
8614328,3,B00FC9FKL8,I loved 1 and 2 of this series but number 3 had too many awkward moves using the chair-it was too hard to follow what she was doing while on all fours-kept straining my neck to see TV and trying to position my chair at the same time upped the frustration factor and I was more aggravated then worked out. Will never use number 3 again-number 2 is my favorite and 1 is good but a little dull,1512000000,,390,4.012820512820513

8614330,5,B00FC9FKL8,"i love tracy anderson's contribution to the fitness world.  her rebellious, black sheep, bucking of convention approach to fitness.  this is early mat work with a chair.  classic tracy anderson.  pouty, glamorous, stone faced, streamlined, chic....little to no instruction.  no counting.  she instructs in voice over but mostly she works.  and works.  and works.  the moves are inventive and challenging AF.  for reasons i cannot explain i can do disc 2 with 2 or 4 lb weights and i love it.  disc 1 is a bit tougher but i haven't visited it in a while.  i don't know that i've tried disc 3 yet.  if you know tracy anderson is not for you, you're not reading this review.  if you're unsure, try it, it won't kill you.  i have a Carmen Elektra video i can never unbuy.  if you like her, this is good stuff.  i love her quietness and the music in her earlier videos.  it kind of takes you to a different place.  i hate workout videos cluttered with people and screaming with colors and distractions.  i won't buy videos that have more than 3 instructors.

8614333,5,B00FC9FKL8,This workout is a welcome challenge for the Tracy Anderson enthusiast. She really isolates those accessory muscles for improved muscle toning.,1466035200,,142,5.809523809523809

8614335,5,B00FC9FKL8,"I LOVE Tracy Anderson! A friend introduced me to her workouts. Advised me she took some getting used but I was excited! She was fit but like me had more an athletic build then all of sudden she was looking more slender. So
I was motivated to give the Tracy Anderson method a fair go. And I did just that! I have two years of metamorphisis DVDs but was looking to add to my Tracy collection. I bought these and even the ""beginner"" DVD isn't so beginner. The advanced is well... ADVANCED. There's one move I can't even do yet. I love the challenge and I love the results she brings. She absolutely takes some getting used to. I played soccer 11 years growing up so this was a massive difference from any type of training I ever did. I'm not a dancer and I probably look ridiculous but I'm at home and no one can see me. Tracy also has a way of making it look easy and it's not! She's serious and her workouts are amazing! I completely recommend her! However, at the end of the day the best workout for anyone is the workout they will do consistently. If you are trying Tracy out for the first time and you don't consistently workout right now... Choose a different DVD to start. I bought these to add to my Tracy collection and it has proven to be a good and challenging series.",1433894400,14,1276,4.233606557377049
8614336,5,B00FC9FKL8,Wife loves it....She uses every morning during the week and it pays off - her body is firm and beautiful.,1430697600,3,105,4.3
