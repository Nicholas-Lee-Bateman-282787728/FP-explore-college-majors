8004702,3,B0000YQHT4,"Personally, if you want a video for $180, (the prices listed to buy this), you are out of your mind. I bought mine from [...] for [...]. However, this video is great if you don't know much about the plane itself. It demonstrates VERY briefly how the pilots prepared for the flight. Very little of the film is actually in the cockpit, which in my mind of being a pilot, is the neatest part. I really don't care much about what the passengers are doing and they show a good part of the movie in the passenger area. The video has a part in it where it shows a short history of Chuck Yeager and the Bell 1 and breaking the sound barrier. It is a neat little piece as they went through so much, and then they show Concorde doing it with ease. If you want to know HOW they really flew the Concorde, cockpit wise, probably not your movie.",1229126400,,831,4.167701863354037
8004703,2,B0000YQHT4,"I own the original 1991 VHS edition of this video, ""How They Fly The Concorde."" Unless the DVD version is substantially more dynamic and in-depth than the VHS, I couldn't recommend anyone paying more than $9.95 for any version of it. The original production was a very superficial presentation of a routine flight from JFK to LHR. Despite considerable time spent in the cockpit, little can be heard of crew or ATC communications over the narrator's constant patter. We don't learn much about the aircraft's technical specifications or even see close-ups of cockpit instrumentation.

The most interesting aspect of the production is that it unintentionally demonstrates how backward much of Concorde's technology was by 1991, compared with newer aircraft of that era. There are no LCD displays in the cockpit (""glass cockpit,"") apparently no video entertainment system in the cabin, and no visible airphones. It's amusing to note that no one in the predeparture VIP lounge is using a laptop or talking on a cellphone.

If you can find this video for a low price and you want yet another Concorde production to round out your library, it might be worth buying. Otherwise, save your money.",1198800000,,1186,5.045918367346939
