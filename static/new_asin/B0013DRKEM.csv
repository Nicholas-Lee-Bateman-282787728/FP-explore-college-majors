8250369,5,B0013DRKEM,"Fine escape film but no Great Escape. In this film, The German actors did a better job than in The Great Escape. Some of my co-worker where in German p.o.w. camps but it was more like Hogans Heroes soon after The Great Escape. Everyone wanted to live and enjoy a better life after The War. Most of the guard served on The Russian front and their prisoners where the crews from shot down B-17's, sometimes called The Hollywood Bomber. All in all, it was a film that recreates the era, and thanks to The German actors, gave it a sense of fright. Glad it's on film and not something I would enjoy being in. The Germans knew The War was lost after Hilter declared war on the U.S. but like us, our country right or wrong, same for us as with The Germans.",1371945600,,749,4.244755244755245
8250370,5,B0013DRKEM,"I was so glad to find this DVD to add to my collection.  I had watched this (actually twice) on television on the History Channel.  Half documentary, half movie, this is the true story of a WWII pilot shot down over occupied France.  I don't want to tell too much of the story and ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it, so I'll just say if you enjoy history in general, and war history specifically, I think you will like this.

It is just a little slow in spots intended for commercials because it recaps some (not much) of what you just watched.  But still a very interesting story and worth watching.",1358985600,,603,4.300884955752212
