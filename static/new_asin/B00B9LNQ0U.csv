5564768,4,B00B9LNQ0U,"Matthew G. Lewis wrote this cult classic THE MONK in 1796, and while it was a scandalous work at the time it has survived as a window into the depravity of certain orders of the church. It is particularly timely as a film now, released amidst the scandals of the Catholic Church. Dominick Moll transforms this story in to a film so reminiscent of 16th century Spain in deco and costumes (Maria Clara Notari and Bina Daigeler), music (Alberto Iglesias), and atmospheric cinematography (Patrick Blossier) that the few lapses the story takes form the novel simply do not detract from the visual beauty of this film.

The film opens with an old beggar dropping off an infant on the church steps of a Capuchin monastery in 16th century Spain. The friars raise the child, convinced he is a miracle from the Virgin Mary and at age 18 Ambrosio (Vincent Cassell) takes the vows and becomes a sanctified Capucin monk, but not just a monk but also one blessed with righteousness and distance from temptation. Scores come to the monastery to simply see him and have him hear their confession. His beneficence to a young nun (Roxane Duran) who has become pregnant is cancelled by the abbess of the nunnery (Geraldine Chaplin) and evil begins to shroud the film.  A young monk Valerio (Dborah Franois) is brought to the monastery masked to apparently cover the brutal burn wounds on his face, but in actuality Valerio has healing powers, is able to heal Ambrosio's frequent severe headaches, and finally reveals to Ambrosio that there is a women beneath that mask. From this point the near holy monk Ambrosio falls from grace and descends into seduction, depravity, satanic secrets and murder.

Yes, there are lapses in the story that beg explanation but the atmosphere created by the cinematic team and the performances by Vincent Cassell and the rest of the cast more than make this a fine cinematic achievement. Grady Harp, March 13",1363910400,12,1921,4.815151515151515

5564775,2,B00B9LNQ0U,"It's an oversimplified and rough summary of the original work. Many missing connections make the whole incoherent. The most brilliant parts of the original novel lie in its description of the struggling between vanity and virtue, temptation and faith. But due to its limited time, one could hardly be convinced there is some struggling or not when the monk is tempted and falls. It's not a decent work even if we speak without any relation to the original because the incoherence makes the whole story unconvincing. I barely gave it a two-star because the atmosphere and music are okay (I like the procession near the end, but without the epic ""violent mob"" part, it just loses much of its meaning), but that's it.

The thing I'd like to emphasize here is that if you want or will read the book, then read it first. If you watch the movie first, it will then ruin the reading experience when you turn to the original novel, because you could predict the story but in a very lame sense (cuz it's how the movie has told you). I mean how could it be fun and thrilling when you know beforehand that true gender and biological relation between the characters?",1416096000,3,1154,4.601941747572815

5564780,3,B00B9LNQ0U,"Cassel turns one of the greatest gothic novels of all time into a short condensed film.  As a director, he removes a lot of the story that has nothing to do with the main plot (i.e. Don Raymond and Agnes) and puts more emphasis on relationships (Ambrosio & Matilda).  Still a fine work because he fits all the plot points well together, but fails to achieve the sort of gut-wrenching punch we get from the original novel.

5564781,5,B00B9LNQ0U,"Vincent Cassel plays a 16th century monk Ambrosio. He was abandoned at the monastery as a mere baby on a stormy night and the brothers took him in as one of their own and raised him to serve God. He grows up to be feared and respected in equal measure and word of his faith and high spirituality spread far and wide bringing fame and money to the monastery.

Then a mysterious man turns up who has suffered disfigurement and asks to become a novice - but is he all he seems to be? Ambrosio is also haunted by a recurring dream and severe migraines all of which could be a sign from on high. Add to the mix the local goings on and the local nunnery and you have a potential mix of religious zeal gone slightly too far in the closeted world of 16th century Spain.

This is a mesmerising film which throws so much into the mix that I was shocked on a couple of occasions. The period detail is fantastic and the locations are stupendous. This is one of those films that just gets under your skin and takes you along for a very dark but rewarding ride indeed.

Excellent performances all round and the cinematography is both subtle and impressive with a score that adds the right amount of `mood' without being over dramatic. Although set in Spain this is a French production with quite good subtitles. Cassel is always good and this is a film that showcases his talent perfectly - absolutely recommended.",1401926400,3,1400,4.397683397683398

I'm surprised it hasn't been filmed before now.  I loved the scenery, the costumes, and particularly Valerio's mask but the near-lack of supernatural beings was disappointing, considering the ending of the novel. The acting is terribly restrained but that may have been because there were English subtitles and if I understood French I wouldn't think that. Perhaps I'm just so accustomed to US gorefests but I thought it came across as a straight historical drama rather than a paranormal one. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film. I just felt more should've been done to point out the supernatural elements and the relationships between some of the characters should've be more developed.

5564786,3,B00B9LNQ0U,"***1/2

Based on the Matthew Gregory Lewis novel published in 1796, the oft-adapted ""The Monk"" is a cinematic oddity about a 16th Century Spanish friar (the understated Victor Cassel) who's winning souls to Christ despite the fact that he is deep into his own crisis of faith (though the movie takes place in Spain, the dialogue is in French). The screenplay by Dominik Moll (who also directed the film) and Anne-Loiuse Trividic is rich in irony as Friar Ambrosio seeks salvation from the very same people who are seeking it from him. Only, in his case, salvation lies in becoming MORE worldly - particularly in the realm of sexuality - not less so. Raised an orphan in the monastery, Ambrosio is coming to realize that there are aspects of the outside world that his cloistered existence has never allowed him to experience, and that, perhaps, God is reaching out to him with the message that it might not be all that bad for him to give himself over to them.

Many people and factors seem to be conspiring to bring him to this realization, including a woman disguised as a mask-wearing monk (her cover is that she claims to have suffered disfiguring burns to ""his"" face); a beautiful, innocent young woman who comes to him for spiritual guidance; a pregnant nun; a series of supernatural dreams and visions; a really nasty poisonous centipede, and a strategically placed, crashing gargoyle.

Or is he simply falling prey to the Devil's lies and machinations and trying to find a way to justify rebelling against God?

It takes about half the length of the movie before we are finally hooked into the story, but, once we are, it becomes a powerful dissertation on the struggle between the flesh and the spirit that has defined the human condition for as long as we have inhabited this planet. The overly enigmatic plotting and deliberate pacing that function as distancing devices at the outset of the movie eventually pay off as the movie's theme crystallizes into sharper view.",1382745600,,1980,4.797653958944282

5564790,4,B00B9LNQ0U,"Monty Python taught that ""nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition,"" but here is a film suggesting that the Inquisition, when most needed, tends to show up too late.

17th Century Spain. Ambrosio is left, as an infant, on the steps of a Capuchin monastery, where, after a time jump, he has evolved into their most powerful preacher (Vincent Cassel). Villagers, aristocrats and farmers gather from miles around to hear his homilies. He is the most revered man in the region.

Ambrosio listens--with perhaps excessive interest?--to a man's confession of rape and incest. He delivers soul-shaking sermons with shocking brevity, then breaks off abruptly, reminding me somewhat of Peter Finch's Jeremiads in NETWORK. He turns monastic rules upside-down to welcome a masked stranger into their midst, an individual who cannot participate in canonical activities because of the wax mask that hides the professed burns on his face.

The masked stranger, Valerio, has mysterious powers of healing the migraines Ambrosio suffers, assuring him a permanent place in the monastery. The identity of the masked stranger can be found by anyone referring to the IMDb, so I will not supply that spoiler here. Suffice it to say that a tide of latent sexuality swells beneath the calm goings-on of the monastery, and that Ambrosio falls victim to it in a decidedly Lynchian fashion. He quickly shifts from victim to predator, and from orthodoxy to heresy. And, yes. The Spanish Inquisition rolls in at the last minute, but not in time to prevent Valerio from committing the ultimate heresy.

The critical complaints about this film have ranged from lukewarm to downright unkind: the visual effects are excessive (in truth, they are as organic to the film as anything by Cocteau), the theology is contrived, the imagery is overly-symbolic, Ambrosio's pastoral advice is ""hollow"", the gothic shocks of the film (based on a 1796 novel) are no longer shocking, and so forth.

Even if I concede all that,  there are too many merits to Dominik Moll's fourth feature to shuffle it aside: his script very neatly compresses a sprawling 500 pg. novel into a fine period suspenser. Moll bravely takes on religious themes at a time when Europe is the least Catholic it has ever been, and does it without an ounce of irony or parody. Grard Hardy, best known for splashy sound designs in films like THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN (1995) & AMELIE (2001) here returns to the subtle soundscapes of Moll's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-A-Friend-Like-Harry/dp/B00005NTN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With A Friend Like Harry</a>. The score is higher in the mix in THE MONK, but I never found it to interfere with Hardy's delicate work.

Finally, if there was any question remaining that Vincent Cassel is capable of anything, this film should put that to rest. He just blows away any Delons or Depardieus or Auteuils...or just name anyone in the pantheon of great French movie actors. Cassel's face refutes any argument that too much was elided from the novel, because it fills in all the gaps. I believe this is a movie that will reward viewers on repeated viewings.",1376784000,7,3169,5.1898238747553815
5564791,5,B00B9LNQ0U,"No matter how we look at it, human frailty will usually kick in.  This monk had the gift of preaching, but he allowed intellectual pride to blind him to the truth that he was just as weak as the Original Predator.  He claimed to be above temptation and sin, so when the fall came it did so with a huge crash.  The beat goes on!  Things never change whether it's medieval times or our own dangerous 21st century.

8564771,1,B00B9LNQ0U,"This movie is terrible.  Once more, modernist writers/producers/directors excise all references to the otherworldly from a work.  And I suppose that it is the trend of 21st century writers to blatantly crap all over the source material they draw from.

The pacing is slow and arthouse.  If this movie were to actually adhere to the source material, it would be twice or maybe even three times as long as it is--and it might even have to be turned into some sort of a Netflix original series.  But again, it's dry and dull.  The makers of this ""film"" luxuriate in purging the otherworldly from the tale, and sewing in a message of how medieval Catholic culture is responsible for the dysfunctions of this story.  There is no Wandering Jew, no appearance of demons, and Ambrosio isn't carried into the air and dropped by a griffin in the end.  It is somber, unexciting, dreary, and disgusting when considering the original novel.

At the end of this movie, Ambrosio is portrayed as a good-hearted guy who only wanted the best for the sister he raped.  He was merely confused--probably from his upbringing in an abbey--no thanks to the Church.  But in the novel, Ambrosio's downfall is due to his unreserved attraction to lust and worldly pleasures, his loss of faith, and his fear of worldly harm.  The novel is supposed to be about the weakness of a man.  Instead, with this movie, we have a silk insult.  We get a veiled, passive-aggressive slap across the face of how horrible it is to be in a religious order.  The movie is a complete atheistic rendition of the novel.

The cheeze late 1970s version of this movie is more accurate than this crappy movie.  The French are terrible at doing this.  It was as blah as watching Valerian last month.  It was a soulless, impotent movie.  Art house critics who know nothing about taste will certainly disagree with me on this.

The classic story of evil temptation is all in the eyes and hidden thoughts of lead actor Vincent Cassel as the monk ""Ambrosio."" Unfortunately, the movie cuts down the book story to its basic parts and might leave viewers wondering why. Also, Cassel has to carry the stage as his co-stars just don't seem up to the task nor really on the same page/stage. Antonia confused me; was she nave, innocent, psychic, holy or all the above? Actress Geraldine Chaplin, with those eyes!, as the mother superior is wickedly superb, but is given only one memorable scene.  She definitely brought darkness and intensity to the movie and had the potential to upstage Cassel.

A movie with so little dialogue needs to convey its story using definitive actions of characters more so than their presumed thoughts and feelings. It almost felt as if I were watching a long, disconnected dream sequence. Cinematography and accompanying music did their part in superbly creating the gothic atmosphere.
