8171593,4,B000MRTYGM,"The Lady's Maid's Bell can be found on DVD as part of a collection of tales dramatized under the title Shades of Darkness, which is a 1980s British production centering on tales of the supernatural. It was produced by June Wyndham Davies and is an ITV production. Initially there were seven hour-long episodes produced in 1983 and there were an additional two hour-long episodes produced in 1984 and screened in 1986.

Based on a short story by Edith Wharton, the wonderful Joanna David stars in this creepy episode as Miss Hartley who is hired as a lady's maid for Mrs. Brympton. Miss Hartley finds her employer and the other staff to be quite amiable, and learns that the prior lady's maid, Emma Saxon, had died after serving Mrs. Brympton for 20 years. Soon after her arrival though, Miss Hartley begins to experience strange encounters with a ghostly figure. It doesn't take her too long to discover that the ghost is of the former lady's maid, but why is the woman's soul not at peace? Throw in a tyrannical husband, a lonely wife, and a kind gentleman neighbor, and you have the ingredients for an engaging supernatural drama. There are no real scares here, just a good old-fashioned ghost story that relies more on atmosphere to build up suspense and Joanna David does a credible job playing the lead role of the hapless lady's maid who doesn't quite know what to do.",1368835200,,1374,4.7012448132780085
