Red Ryder talks to homesteaders about good land for $2 an acre in Paradise Valley. But water is plentiful in winter but dries up in summer. Red says a dam can be built to store water. One man objects to this plan, they vote on it. There is a fire that threatens the land. Is it arson? Men work to beat out the fire. There are gunshots, who is firing at Red? Little Beaver tells about lost water from the dam. Men plot to steal the lands of Paradise Valley and the water rights. There is enough water as long as it isn't wasted. What if someone steals water at night? Red investigates and discovers the loss. The next day Blaine visits Red Ryder and asks him to write a column. But Red isn't a writer.

Red delivers bags of food to a needy family. Two plotters plant an explosive to destroy the peoples dam. Then a fire burns down a barn. One settler sold out for a bag of freshly minted double eagles. Bandits rob and kill two men in a freight wagon. Red Ryder shows up to pursue them, but they get away with the mail bag. There is a meeting, men in Center City want to buy the water right. People sign up for this deal. There is a new seller of goods in town with much lower prices. Who is behind this? Center City has a water shortage, it affects its growth. Columnist Red Ryder warns about the disaster caused by a water shortage for Paradise Valley. He promotes a campaign to create Water Bonds for a new dam.

There is a stockholders meeting over policy, it goes against the people of Paradise Valley. There is a surprise after the meeting! Steve returns to attack Red Ryder over the land deal. Red goes to visit Blaine and finds him unconscious. The doctor and Sheriff visit, Blaine says he remembers nothing. Some men ride to see the man who is behind the plot, there is shooting. The bad guy Bill rides away in a wagon, Red pursues him. There is a fight in the wagon until it overturns. The evidence in the wagon will get the dam back to the homesteaders. Water flows through a shallow channel for the people again. Blaine and Associates Indicted says the headline, the Court decided in favor of the ranchers. Isnt that swell?

Red Ryder began as a newspaper comic strip in the late 1930's and lasted until 1964. Many comic strips from that time are also gone. The Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming inspired many stories where a big corporation tried to swindle people out of their homesteads so they could be taken by the big corporation. This story is different as they use water rights instead of gunmen to drive people away.",1511049600,,2581,4.370833333333334
