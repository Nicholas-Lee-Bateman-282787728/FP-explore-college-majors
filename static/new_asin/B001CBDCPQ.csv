8453590,1,B001CBDCPQ,"There is a defect on this product at the 23-24 min on the disc at the 30-29 score in the 1st half.  Bought 2 discs and both have the same problem.  Played it on 3 DVD players and all locked up and had to return it.  GREAT GAME, but can't watch it.  Bought it again after the product was discontinued and put back onto the market (assuming it was fixed) and still has the same problem (1-3-09).",1218153600,9,393,4.064935064935065
