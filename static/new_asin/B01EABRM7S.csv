7734237,4,B01EABRM7S,The 3D is INSANE. well worth it if you like 3D films. There wasn't a second in this film that I felt like the 3D wasn't well done.,1480377600,,130,3.6785714285714284
7734238,5,B01EABRM7S,"Most excellent. I know 3D isn't a thing anymore, but I'm glad I was able to snag this in 3D because it's phenomenal. Also--REGION FREE!!!

Love it.

Thanks UK.",1480032000,,159,4.448275862068965
7734239,4,B01EABRM7S,"As everyone on here has said, beautiful graphics, they did a great job with all of it, the animals all being CGI looked amazing as well as all the scenery throughout the movie. Completely brought the animated version to life! Same story line with a few different twists than Disney's animated version, adds a little more darkness to it like the other live action movies by Disney have so I wouldn't recommend this to under 7 year olds, the snake, Kaa looks very realistic, there are a few deaths in the movie, and King Louie the Orangutan is not as friendly as the cartoon version and is a strangely huge in size, not to mention the menacing Shere Khan the tiger. Really great movie, all ages above 7 will like it, and the little boy who plays Mowgli did a GREAT job, very entertaining! Voices of the animals are done by Ben Kingsley: Bagheera......Baloo the Bear: Bill Murray.....King Louie: Christopher Walkin.....Kaa the snake: Scarlett Johansson",1478908800,,949,4.757575757575758
7734240,4,B01EABRM7S,"I was saddened that I didn't realize that it didn't come with digital copy. I would have never bought had I paid better attention, without the digital copy. For that amount of money that I paid for it I was sure it would come with the digital copy automatically . Learned a lesson today never assume anything read better everything next time.",1478908800,,342,4.532258064516129

7734254,5,B01EABRM7S,Excellent 3D.  Very good live action adaptation to a Disney animated feature.  In many ways better.  Walken's Orang king was much creepily sinister.  Does honor to Kinlin's work.  Sit though the credits.  You will not be sorry.,1489968000,,227,5.0

7734258,5,B01EABRM7S,"The CGI, the acting of Neel Sethi as Mowgli was very good, considering his experience, or lack of. Bill Murray also was perfect for Baloo. I enjoyed all the other ""voices"" but Murray nailed it. The whole family enjoyed it from 8 to 74 years old. We've watched it several times and it's always impressive to see the realistic animals and jungle.",1481760000,,344,4.564516129032258
7734259,4,B01EABRM7S,"And exceptional remake of a true classic! This is a good example of how live action and computer-generated images can be so seamlessly integrated. The 3-D effects are  particularly effective  with the fine photography which carries you through the journey.  Technology is truly exceptional... in the case of the animals it would be hard to believe that they're not real except for the fact that they do talk...
A really wonderful adventure suitable for the entire family",1481500800,3,470,5.077922077922078
