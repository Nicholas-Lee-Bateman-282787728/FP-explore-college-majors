8498615,5,B006HVB44C,This is a world class band that had more success in other countries than they had in the US. Go figure. If you're a Rainmakers fan you'll love this performance. Powerful!,1357948800,,170,4.516129032258065
8498616,5,B006HVB44C,"Brilliant DVD  of a band which has always scored more points in my home than worldwide. Over the past 47 years I have awarded an Album of the year, of the album that grabbed me most that year, starting with Otis Blue in 1965. The Rainmakers are one of the very few artistes who have scored twice. [An achievement they share with the Who, the German band BAP, and the Dead.] Single time winners include Bob Dylan, Cream, Mike Oldfield, Mississippi John Hurt, Doug MacLeod, Otis Taylor, oh I could go on, but I won't.....

If this one had been an LP/CD it might have been a contender this year!",1347494400,3,592,4.372727272727273
8498617,5,B006HVB44C,"The Rainmakers are a great band, and a great live band.  This DVD does an outstanding job of capturing them.  It's amazingly well done.  If you like the Rainmakers, I assure you, you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't checked out the Rainmakers, this isn't a bad place to start.  The video quality is excellent, the videography and editing is superb, the sound is solid.  Nothing to distract from enjoying the band.  And there is much to enjoy.  Great songs, well played, really top quality music.  And FUN.  The Rainmakers are a fun band, and this DVD captures that.

The lineup is original members Bob Walkenhorst (lead vocals, guitar), Rich Ruth (bass), and Pat Tomek (drums) plus newest member Jeff Porter on lead guitar.  Jeff Porter fits right in and is a great addition to the band.",1342828800,3,793,4.708029197080292
8498618,5,B006HVB44C,"A great dvd, from a great show, highly recommended for any rainmakers fan, a great band that still should be better known.",1334966400,2,122,4.590909090909091
