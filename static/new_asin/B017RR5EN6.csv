7513198,3,B017RR5EN6,"Mountain Men is my Favorite Show and as for the Show I give it 5 stars. However someone in producing the DVD chose to only include the first 8 episodes on this DVD. I was VERY Disappointed that it only has half the season. I had to purchase the digital version from Amazon to get the complete season, this works OK, but its NOT as good as having a DVD that I can watch with my ""personal size"" DVD player. I emailed the producers of this DVD SEVERAL times and asked if there will be a Part 2 that will include the second half of the season, Three months late I have got No Response from them.",1465516800,6,591,4.05982905982906
7513199,1,B017RR5EN6,I AM PISSED!!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW BUT AM VERY ANGRY THAT THEY RIPPED ME OFF BY CUTTING JUST OVER HALF THE EPISODES. I WILL NOT EVER BUY ANYMORE SEASONS AND I REFUSE TO WATCH THE SHOW ANYMORE. THERE ARE OTHER SHOWS SIMILAR THAT I LIKE BUT I WILL NOT BE SCREWED AGAIN. HISTORY CHENNEL SUCKS!!!!!!!!,1464652800,2,295,4.285714285714286

7513235,2,B017RR5EN6,"I have to agree with what other people have posted.  We LOVE LOVE LOVE this show.  We are big fans!  BUT, we are VERY disappointed that we only got HALF of the season on this disk.  Buyers should be made aware that it's only half the episodes, and if they want to see the rest of the season, they have to go back and buy each episode one by one... not cool.  Don't blame Eustace, Tom, or Marty, though... They're just doing what they do, trapping animals and living the life :)",1461974400,,477,4.141304347826087

7513239,4,B017RR5EN6,"This is a great series, however you only getting half a season of shows. But it gets you familiar with the show. You watch the episodes and figure out who you like and you watch these people live. We are a society of grocery stores. But for these 6 men the outdoors is where they go for their meals. A wonderful series for anyone to watch. I have every season that's released.",1459987200,,376,4.236111111111111
7513240,1,B017RR5EN6,I love the mountain men series. It's something that my husband and I can enjoy together. I have all the seasons. I was very disappointed with this one because I was not aware that's it's not the full season. Very frustrating.,1459555200,3,225,4.512195121951219
7513241,5,B017RR5EN6,I Love this show! best TV show I've  seen in years.,1459468800,,51,3.6363636363636362
7513242,3,B017RR5EN6,This was a rip thought I was getting a full season just to fine out we received 8 episodes and then found new ones on the list.  I love the show but this was a pre-order and feel like i got sucker punched.,1459123200,2,205,3.7674418604651163
7513243,5,B017RR5EN6,"I have all of the Mountain Men seasons and this is just as good as all the others! Some previous guys are gone but good old Eustace, Marty, Tom and Rick are pushing it forward.  There's a new guy trekking through Alaska that seems to be a good add.  There's nothing like useful information and seeing craftsmanship put to action.  There are some kill scenarios in this one that brings home the challenges.  I finished this season so soon I was left wanting more!  Cannot wait for the next release.  You won't be sorry!",1458950400,,518,4.457446808510638

7513245,5,B017RR5EN6,i really enjoy Mountain Men great show. thankyou Amazon.  CHEERS!.,1458777600,,66,5.6
7513246,2,B017RR5EN6,I love the show but not the fact that we pay for 8 when there are 16 episodes in the full season. Very Misleading!,1458777600,3,114,3.7916666666666665
7513247,5,B017RR5EN6,Love the Mountain Men. They never get old or boring.,1458259200,,52,4.3
7513248,5,B017RR5EN6,Wish they had put all the episodes from that season on these disks i am a little upset with History Channel,1457308800,,107,4.142857142857143
7513249,5,B017RR5EN6,Enjoy watching Tom.  Whatever happened to Morgan?,1457222400,,49,6.0
7513250,3,B017RR5EN6,"I love the series but very disappointed the disk only has 8 of the 16 episodes that were in the season. Star rating is only for incompleteness of the dvd, because it was sold as the entire season.",1457222400,2,196,4.184210526315789
7513251,5,B017RR5EN6,"I always enjoy this series and now have all four seasons.  Whether you're a hunter or not, the location landscape video is worth the price of the video.  Plus, surviving the extreme elements is always interesting and usually quite informative, while illustrating some of the adverse situations these men encounter.  If you can't go there in person this is the next best thing... no snow, ice or predator animals to confront.",1457222400,,424,4.943661971830986
7513252,4,B017RR5EN6,"My husband & I love ""Mountain Men"" and I was thrilled to have found the first 4 seasons on DVD. However, we were a little disappointed when the DVD of season 4 did not include all the episodes. There were at least a couple of the last episodes missing. It didn't cover where Morgan gets to his property in Alaska and get his first supply drop. That part was a let down for us.",1457049600,4,376,4.094594594594595
7513253,1,B017RR5EN6,Only eight episodes. Not the complete season. Misleading.,1456185600,6,57,6.25
7513284,3,B017RR5EN6,"Now I know why it doesn't have ""season 4"" in the title, it's only 8 episodes or half a season, very disappointing to say the least. I've always been a fan of the show but will not be purchasing half seasons in the future. It would seem that if you can't afford high-speed internet and the $3 per episode price tag that comes with streaming video you're out of luck.",1455926400,9,365,4.228571428571429
7513285,1,B017RR5EN6,"So excited about getting it, so disappointed after recieving it. Two discs and it's like they forgot to add the other disc !! Second disc ends with no ending !! You are left hanging? Is this packaged correctly ? Are they just trying to make more money by asking us to buy the second half of the season ?",1455926400,12,303,4.1525423728813555
7513286,5,B017RR5EN6,Only complaint is that there is not more episodes,1455753600,,49,4.555555555555555
7513287,3,B017RR5EN6,This was nowhere as good as season 2. I feel I got jipped on these already told story lines. What a waste,1455667200,,105,3.8181818181818183
7513288,1,B017RR5EN6,"Well the first HALF of the season was great,  but it was only HALF of the season.  I preordered this back in Dec,  sure wish it was advertised as ONLY BEING HALF of season 4.
5 stars for the first half, but a 1 star rating because the advertising is a bit misleading. When do I get the rest of season 4?",1455667200,19,303,3.8548387096774195
7513289,1,B017RR5EN6,So disappointed. Left hanging because only half the episodes. Feeling VERY jilted,1455580800,12,81,5.833333333333333
7513290,1,B017RR5EN6,"I bought this for my husband because he is a huge fan of Mountain Men but this ad is VERY misleading as you will notice from the other reviews and questions being asked. I had no idea this was Season 4 as it doesn't seem to be listed anywhere LIKE ON THE DISC ITSELF and it's only 8 episodes. The other 3 seasons clearly state what they are on the disc and in the description. Not sure what happened here. Pretty disappointing for the fans because at first glance it appears to be a ""Bonus"" disc. Returning this item as we have already purchased Season 4 on Amazon Digital TV. It's getting one star for this reason.",1455408000,13,615,4.264957264957265
7513291,3,B017RR5EN6,"Family LOVE Mountain Men Seasons!  We had 1, 2, 3 and just recently was able to purchase the 'Season 4', or what we were led to believe was the 'Season'.  The add does not specify that it is only half of the Season!  It does state 8 episodes on 2 discs at the very top of the box, but this is definitely not noticeable, not expected.  The description does give the Run Time in minutes and states 2 discs which isn't going to mean anything to us.  I am sure the problem with everyone is that we expected this to be as Season 1, 2 and 3 were.  The entire Season!  After all it states ""Season"" 4!  How many would have thought to read the little details after seeing very successful and complete 'Seasons' in 1, 2, and 3 and if did to realize that would equal only half a Season.  We LOVE the program but are disappointed that it is not the complete Season, but yet led to believe it was, since NO obvious statement was made in the description that it would only be half the Season.  Ad should have specified without a doubt it would only be half.  This will cost twice the amount as the previous Season did to have the complete Season 4.  We still  LOVE our Mountain Men!",1455321600,24,1168,4.160714285714286

8740180,3,B017RR5EN6,My husband and I love the show Mountain Men we have the first 4 seasons have been happy with all of them until this one as it is all about half the season you miss Marty's family coming out to the trap line and Morgan making it to his property and I'm sure much more. would love to have season 5and 6 if you get the whole season .,1509494400,,330,3.7971014492753623

8740182,2,B017RR5EN6,"Not complete set as mentioned by others. There is no Season 5 set released at this time. Why? The mountain men are all very monetary IMHO. They should live of the land and not even think about money. It is a scripted reality show and it is not even really real.
When you google you see that some cast members earn in excess of 200.000 bucks/year. That gives me a bad vibe for the show, cast and their makers and History Channel. They are all about mo money and 78 % of the US population living paycheck to paycheck",1504224000,2,514,4.202020202020202
