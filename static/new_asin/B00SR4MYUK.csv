6991921,5,B00SR4MYUK,"A true homage with modern digital video and RZA's tracks inbetween scenes.  The movie was shot in Thailand and you may see a very well known Thai actor in this if you follow Thai films.  If you don't know who the Shaw Brothers are, then I'll just say that if you like the first one you'll like this one.  It is lower budget than the first film, however the cheesiness just gets cheesier in a good way.",1428192000,3,401,4.181818181818182
6991922,5,B00SR4MYUK,An Extreme Improvement over the First Film. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is brilliant essentially playing Shang Tsung all over again and that's Not a bad thing for this kind of Flick. I really enjoyed it and will be picking up DVD's for me and my friends.,1428105600,,247,4.636363636363637
6991923,4,B00SR4MYUK,"If you liked the first film, you should like this one. This is also done in a grindhouse style combining a martial arts film with a hip-hop soundtrack. Part 2 gives you the ending of previous film, which I found to be a confusing mess anyway. You don't have to have seen the first film to enjoy this one, it gives you enough information.

The silver mine is run by Master Ho (Carl Ng) who has enslaved the village to his will with his Beetle Clan. Li (Dustin Nguyen) speaks for the miners and is also a good fighter. Thaddeus (RZA ) gets his butt beat early in the film on his quest to find redemption, Buddha, and inner peace. He and his iron fists float up to the village.

There is also a string of murders happening to young girls. They are getting their chi stolen from them. Rumor claims it is the spirit of Lord Pi who died in the first film. There is the  Golden Nectar pool guarded by monks for immortality. They eased up on the plot aspect.

The film boasts plenty of fighting, head rolls, blood squirts, and an exploding body.

6991925,2,B00SR4MYUK,"As is often the case, period martial arts movies may contain fantastic elements, in this case chi force is used to activate artificial metal (forged steel actually, and not iron) limbs, but also there are murders where the victim is drained of chi force to a mummy-like state.

Overactive camera and all-around, low level acting bring this one a notch or two below where it should really be.

There is one awesome fight scene (not one of the ones with iron appendages as those obviously tend to handicap the action.)",1446422400,,516,4.722222222222222

6991928,3,B00SR4MYUK,"I bought this for my dad. We really enjoyed the first movie but will describe this one with a shrug and ""It's okay"".  Expect the same amount of weird violence and somewhat bad acting as the first one.",1441152000,,200,4.2631578947368425

6991930,1,B00SR4MYUK,"Slow, grinding boring movie, omg paid 1 dollar on red box and just stopped watching this movie it sucks hard. I couldn't take it any longer no action lots of slow agonizing drama in between very short action scenes. Just don't bother with this one.",1436140800,,248,4.533333333333333
6991931,3,B00SR4MYUK,"I thought that this movie might have been better than the first movie. I was somewhat disappointed. It has some good fighting parts, but over all the story line could have been better.",1435017600,,184,4.606060606060606
6991932,2,B00SR4MYUK,"Hip Hip producer-turned-actor/filmmaker RZA (""American Gangster"") returns as the title character in this sequel to his directorial debut.  Though he stays out of the director's chair this time around, he is credited as executive producer (along with previous cohort Eli Roth) and music supervisor, under his real name of Robert Diggs.  Say what you want about the man's acting, but I think he does a good job here, and while I wouldn't exactly consider him to be a consummate thespian, none of the crappy films I've seen him in were ruined by his performance; they'd have stunk just fine on their own.

The prologue features Buddhist monks defending the fountain of Golden Nectar, the source of Chi, from the evil Lord Pi, who is defeated. Then (a while later, I guess), on a seemingly quiet boat ride to replenish his Chi and find inner peace at this legendary monastery, ol' Iron Fists himself, the blacksmith Thaddeus (RZA), is attacked by the brother of a vanquished foe.  Though victorious, he is seriously injured.  Meanwhile, an entire small village is enslaved by Master Ho (Carl Ng, ""New Police Story"") and his Beetle Clan, who brutally force the citizens to mine silver from the mountain.  The village looks to Li Kung (Dustin Nguyen, ""Zero Tolerance"") to lead a rebellion, but tires of his speeches about ""patience"".  When his own brother is found dead after publicly defeating one of Ho's goons, Li Kung decides it's time. While all this is going down, Kung's daughter, Innocence (Pim Bubear, ""Ninja 2""), is healing Thaddeus after she finds him clinging to a piece of driftwood.  Li Kung hopes that Thaddeus will be well enough to make weapons for the inevitable rumble.  And if things weren't bad enough, the villagers keep finding dead young women with their Chi completely drained.

This film's existence is kind of puzzling.  Its predecessor took an enormous amount of flack from fans and critics alike.  As a fan of the material that RZA was influenced by, I quite liked it, except for one crucial factor:  the fights.  They sucked.  A lot.  They sucked out loud.  While the fights in this sequel are a significant improvement, they're still not very good.  There are definitely some moments scattered here-and-there (which I could not say about part 1), but on a whole... yawn.  Oh, and 95% of the climax is in slow motion, my Achilles' heel in the world of cinematic martial arts enjoyment.

The generally cliched story's not bad, and even managed to pull me in after a pretty goofy start, with some light touches of Buddhist philosophy, but it was a level of involvement that could not be maintained.  There's adequate use of location (Thailand filling in for China) and costumes, but much less emphasis on the cool weapons of the 1st film.  The Hip Hop soundtrack did not bother me and I thought it was quite effective at times. Acting's generally meh-to-decent, with the occasional dip into downright stinky, but Carl Ng (son of Hong Kong comedian Richard Ng, ""Winners & Sinners"") is someone I wouldn't mind seeing more of.

The Universal DVD has anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1) and contains both Rated & Unrated versions at 90 and 91 minutes, respectively.  Languages and subtitles available in English, Spanish, and French.  Bonus features include deleted scenes, a ""making of"" featurette, and commentary with RZA and director Roel Reine (who seems content directing sequels to John Cena movies that don't include John Cena).  Honestly, I can't recommend it, but, despite the lackluster fights, I did enjoy watching it.  Just not all that much.  It lacks the enthusiasm of the 1st film and doesn't improve enough on the fights. 2.5 out of 5.
