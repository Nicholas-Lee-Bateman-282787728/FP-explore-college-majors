3169273,4,B0017ANAX6,"This film contains, male and female frontal nudity (might be an apron), foul language, smoking, sexual content, gross humor.  Rated ""R"".
  It's been nearly 4 years that we have waited for this sequel to Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle (2004). It was actually filmed in January to March of 2007. It was originally meant to be a straight-to-DVD release, however they decided to release it in the theaters, April 25, 2008.
  The great comedic chemistry between Kal Penn and John Cho returns in ""Harold & Kumar Escape to Guantanamo Bay"".
  Also returning with Kal Penn and John Cho are Paula Garces as ""Maria"", David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Christopher Meloni, Neil Patrick Harris, Errol Sitahal.
  The writers of the first film, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have written and directed this second film.
  This second movie begins on the same day where the first movie ended. Since Harold (John Cho) has finally spoken and kissed the girl he had been fantasizing about, but was too closed-up to speak to her before, he needs to see her again, but she is on her way to Amsterdam, Netherlands for 10 days.  Kumar (Kal Penn) rescheduled his job interview and has booked a flight for both of them to Amsterdam, so that Harold can find Maria (Paula Garces).
  When do these guys ever sleep?
  At the airport, Kal sees an old girlfriend, Vanessa (Danneel Harris) who is getting married soon.
  The flight doesn't go off without a hitch thanks to Kumar and his smoking pipe invention.  An old lady passenger gets disturbed and Harold & Kumar are arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay jail.
  As the title of this film suggests, they do escape and this leads them on another mis-hap adventure.
  Beverly D'Angelo makes an appearance as ""Sally"".
  To see a surprise scene, you must wait until after the end credits.
  Not as funny as the first film. Some scenes are just too unbelievable too be funny. The movie plays like a mushroom dream, but then again so did the Cheech & Chong movies.
  I hope Kal Penn and John Cho continue to make many movies together. They are a good comedic team.

  John Cho was ""Sulu"" in the new motion picture,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;released May 8, 2009.

3169277,1,B0017ANAX6,"Being a big fan of the first Harold and Kumar, I had high expectations for this sequel.  I had heard some initial negative reviews, but still went to the theater, wanting very badly to like it.  Sadly, it was not to be.  By the end, I was ashamed to be in the theater--I felt offended, cheated, and even a little nauseated.  This film was incredibly lame and had almost none of the charm of the original.  Its almost as if the writers went out their way to make it brain dead.

Some specifics:
1.  Many of the bits were blatently recycled from the original (like the weird couple living in the woods), but just weren't funny this time around.  There was also a much greater reliance on toilet humor than in the first.
2.  Almost everyone who was a white male was portrayed as stupid, racist, or both.
3.  The Guantanamo Bay scenes were in incredibly bad taste--especially the bit about the ""sandwiches"" fed to the prisoners.  Sorry, but implying that military guards pull that stuff goes way beyond being not funny--it is highly offensive and insulting to those who wear the uniform.
4.  Some of the same characters show up again.  While this could have been cool, especially the Neil Patrick Harris cameo, it turned out to be pointless and incoherent.
5.  And, of course, the obligatory scenes making George Bush look like a drug addled moron.  I'm sure the writers had to work really hard to come up with those.

Bottom Line:  If you liked the original, stay away--far away--from this awful sequel.",1209254400,17,1500,4.6

One, Harold, plays the uptight and wants to color inside of the lines and Kumar will try anything and colors outside of the lines every chance he gets and does it with believing that the people around him are really not trying to harm them in any way.  He gets surprised and Harold is right there to remind him of the errors of his ways.  These two are the ""Cheech and Chong"" characters from the 80's and you laugh out loud at the situations that they get into trying to get out of another.

3169370,3,B0017ANAX6,"I thought the movie was actually pretty funny. I only saw the regular version, not the unrated one. So this complaint relates to that film. Any fan of pop culture who is even remotely aware of current cable shows or mainstream R-Rated films has to have noticed how the penis is now shown IN EVERYTHING. From shows like Spartacus to films like Hall Pass. And not just fleeting glimpses of male genitals but sometimes extended CLOSE UPS (just watch American Reunion).

Yet for reasons I can't fathom, a woman's vagina (technically the vulva, or lips of the vagina) is ALWAYS CENSORED. This movie does just that. In the ""Bottomless Party"" scene when the woman answers the door nude,the camera zooms to her crotch. She is obviously wearing a merkin (fake pubic hair to cover the vagina). The producers of the film later admitted this.

Why in the world do we see the penis in the most graphic manner possible, including the ""Harold & Kumar"" films, yet a woman's crotch will always be censored. Ever since women started grooming in a style that would reveal the vagina if seen nude it is now standard practice for Hollywood to censor the vagina with the utilization of a merkin (pubic wig). Other than Rosario Dawson in ""Trance"" every female full nude scene on cable shows or in films, ALWAYS has the woman wearing some kind of merkin.

We see extended close-ups of the penis in mainstream films like ""Bruno"" yet a crotch shot of a woman in this film is censored. Just once I would love to see female nudity as graphic as the male nudity. It seems that the basic rule of thumb for any R-Rated comedy is that ""female nudity will be limited to just breasts, but as for male nudity we will show actual genitals, sometimes even in a close-up.

Directed and written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg.

 Originally Rated ""R"". This is the UNRATED version.  Contains male and female frontal nudity (might be an apron), foul language, smoking, sexual content and gross humor.

  It has been nearly 4 years we have waited for this sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-Kumar-Go-to-White-Castle-Extreme-Unrated-Edition/dp/B00068WOH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Extreme Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2004). It was actually filmed in January to March 2007. It was originally meant to be a straight-to-DVD release, however they changed their minds and released it in the movie theaters April 25, 2008. Thank goodness.
  The great comedic chemistry between Kal Penn and John Cho returns in ""Harold & Kumar Escape to Guantanamo Bay"". Also returning are Paula Garces as ""Marie"", David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Christopher Meloni, Neil Patrick Harris, Errol Sitahal.
 The writers of the first film, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have written and directed this second film.
  This movie begins on the same day where the first movie ended. Since Harold (John Cho) has finally spoken and kissed the young woman he had been fantasizing about, but was too closed-up to speak to her before, he needs to see her again, however, she is on her way to Amsterdam, Netherlands for 10 days.
 Kumar (Kal Penn) rescheduled his job interview and has booked a flight for both of them to Amsterdam so Harold can find Maria (Paula Garces).
 When do these guys sleep?
 At the airport, Kal sees an old girlfriend, Vanessa (Danneel Harris) who is getting married.
 The flight doesn't go off without a hitch, thanks to Kumar and his smoking pipe invention. An old lady passenger (Juli Erickson) gets disturbed and Harold & Kumar are arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay jail.
 As the title of this film suggests, they do escape and this leads to another late-night adventure.

 This film contains male and female frontal nudity (might be an apron), foul language, smoking, sexual content and gross humor. Rated ""R"".

 Beverly D'Angelo makes an appearance as ""Sally"".

 Jon Hurwitz appears as the Dancing Devil in the Costume Shop and Hayden Schlossberg appears as the Dancing Monkey in the Costume Shop.

 To see a surprise scene, wait until after the end credits.

 Not as funny as the first film. Some scenes are just too unbelievable too be funny. The movie plays plays like a mushroom dream, but then again, so did the Cheech & Chong movies.
 I hope Kal Penn and John Cho continue to make many more movies together. They are a good comedic team.

3169392,4,B0017ANAX6,"Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay(released April/08)is a worthy sequel to the surprise first movie hit,H&K at the White Castle. Kumar Patel(Karl Penn)and Harold Lee(John Cho) are back as the two traveling misfits who bungle their way from one funny situation to another. Whether this sequel is up to the standards set by the first one is up for debate,but either way you come down on the issue,both are funny films to be watched with an open mind and NOT to be taken too seriously.
The film opens where the first left off as we find Harold and Kumar setting off to Amsterdam to see Harold's apartment neighbour who has flown off there previously. Of course this situation sets things up for alot of trouble/laughs ahead. Kumar,the main instigant stoner of the two,has sneaked aboard a smokeless bong and is in the bathroom trying it out. Harold enters,scolds Kumar and leaves. But the door is ajar and someone mistakes his ""appliance""for a bomb. The two end up arrested and being interrogated by a totally over obsessive Homeland Security Agent(Rob Cordry).He believes Al Quaida and the North Koreans have joined together and the two are sent where all terrorists are sent;Guantanamo Bay.
Well it is no picnic there but the two somehow manage to escape the prison and flee to the States aboard a boat of illegal Cuban immigrants. In Miami they locate a friends house to get help. From here,with a borrowed car they make their way to Texas where Kumar's ex-girlfriend is getting married. Along the way they get lost in a bad part of Birmingham,they meet up with a brother/sister-husband/wife couple with a son who has one eye,and finally they get mixed up with the KKK.As they flee they run into their old friend Neil Patrick Harris who takes them to a ""roadhouse"".
When things go south there and they are fleeing,Harris gets shot in the back by the head madam and is left for dead.
H&K finally arrive at Kumar's exe's place on her wedding day. The guy she is marrying is seemingly a good pal of Harold's,but in the end it is he who turns both of them into Homeland Security. From here it is a free plane ticket back to GB.However the two escape the plane and land smack dab into the living room of ex-President Bush at his Texas retreat. The three get along like gang busters and they are soon all toking up. In the end H&K are pardoned,presidentially of course,and with Kumar's old girlfriend in tow,all head to Amsterdam where they surprise Harold's girlfriend in a big reunion.
James Adomian does a fantastic job as president Bush and Neil Patrick Harris keeps his off the wall persona on high gear throughout the film,as he did in the first one. Of course most of the situations the two run into are tremendously far fetched,but that is the element that gives this film its spontaneity and keeps it moving. You just never know what is going to come around the next corner,as H&K are constantly reacting to this onslaught of circumstances either directly or indirectly their own fault.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. This two disc edition is the only way to go. The first disc gives you a choice between the unrated version and ""Dude,change the movie"".If you choose the latter,an on screen message will pop up during the films play and you will have the choice to skip the scene or go on with it. You also have commentary by the director and stars or commentary with the directors,John Cho and James Adomian. The second disc is loaded with extras such as a featurette on the making of the film,a Bush PSA,18 deleted scenes and nine extra deleted/alternate/outtakes.
All in all this is the best way to get the full H&K Escape from Guantanamo Bay experience. You have two ways to view it and it is loaded with extras. This sequel is a deserving one from the first and you will never find yourself waiting too long for the next laugh to come. Recommended.",1334966400,,3916,4.644092219020173

For the sensitive one, this movie will rub you the wrong way. This movie touches on every sensitive issues like racism, terrorism, stereotyping etc but it's not meant to be taken seriously. They make fun of the ridiculous sensitive issues that we are currently facing in our society.

While on the first movie you follow Harold & Kumar on their journey to find White Castle, in this movie you follow them again escaping the Guantanamo Bay. As usual they find really crazy characters along the way... KKK wannabes, in-bred son of a hillbilly family, even the president. The best character to me will always be NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. He's just legen---wait for it---DARY.

The bluray has some cool features but the best feature would be to change the story. You will be given an option at certain points to change the story or scene. If you change the first option (where Kumar smokes his bong in a plane and mistaken as terrorist) and choose not to smoke the bong, it'll change into a completely different chick-flick movie in Amsterdam!

3169399,1,B0017ANAX6,"I saw this movie when it came out and was very disappointed. Seeing the two Asian men peering through bars on the promo posters, I thought this may be an interesting insight into the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, or at least some sought of social commentary. But no, any thoughtfulness is completely squandered to complete mediocrity. And the dealing with issues of prisoner abuse are treated with such indifference as to become fodder for dirty jokes amongst young men, i.e. 'C-meat sandwich'

The fact that the leading stars of this movie are Indian and Asian is of little, if any, consequence. 'Kumar', especailly, is just another bong-smoking, navel gazing, stereotypical young loud-mouth who is either trying to score a joint or get into a chicks pants, like any character from a barrage of American road-trip movies. The only thing that saves this a little is the fact that 'Harold' is an interesting character, because his naive seriousness and COMMON SENSE is so refreshing. It's almost a reminder as to how lame all the other characters are.

The plot is basically this: the pair end up in Guan. Bay at the start of the movie, but quickly escape and the rest is predictable cliched jokes about inbreeding Hillbilly's, public sex and pointless whacko's who brand prostitutes. If you've seen the likes of Jay and Silent Bob or Dukes of Hazzard, you can fill in the blanks as you watch it.  The rating is 3/10 or 1 1/2 stars.",1304380800,,1443,4.78714859437751

*SPOILERS*

The thing that made Harold and Kumar so appealing in their first film, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" was that they were just two ordinary guys driven by the very modest goal of finding the perfect burger to satisfy their munchies.  But turn them into suspected terrorists on the lam from Homeland Security, ship them off to GITMO as detainees, and have them sharing doobies with none other than George W. Bush himself - all of which happens in ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"" - and they lose the very thing we liked best about them:  their relatability.

John Cho and Kal Penn are as disarming as ever as the endearing potheads who'll go to just about any lengths to get a good high, and Neil Patrick Harris returns in a good-natured appearance playing a satirical version of himself, but the script reduces the movie to just another dumb, disjointed, anything-for-a-laugh action comedy that is long on gross-out gags and vulgarity and short on anything even approaching genuine wit or humor.",1272153600,,1034,4.8192090395480225

The unrated DVD release has two versions of the film, but I only watched the rated version so far. It's hard to believe the unrated version could be any more raunchy or have more nudity in it?!

Despite many attempts to divert my eyes or coil in disgust at certain elements, the chemistry that Kal Penn and John Cho have is really amazing.  Its also refreshing to see a movie like this where the two lead characters are not caucasian proving that certain aspects of culture are universal (in this instance it's questionable whether it is a good or bad thing).

I'm giving Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay 3 stars instead of 4 because there were aspects of the movie and dialogue that I thought could have been better, but I had so much fun watching it... often covering my mouth and laughing in hysterics at the antics of the main characters and supporting cast.

3169411,3,B0017ANAX6,"The airwaves and DVD players are saturated with mindless, sophomoric, ribald comedies featuring a healthy preoccupation with drug use, so let's add HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANOMO BAY to the mix, shall we?  Pals Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) get mistaken for terrorists on a flight (and the satire of stereotyping is a major theme of the film) and subsequently are sent to the notorious Gitmo for some of that ""enhanced interrogation"".  A lucky escape has them back in the States and on the run from a flag-waving zealot (Rob Corddry is a funny guy), and the chase generates adventures and mayhem.  Some of it is funny, some of it is not, all of it is contrived.

An extended cameo by Neil Patrick Harris (playing himself) is certainly. . .interesting.  While his exuberant, mushroom-popping performance is dynamic, his sudden, violent demise (again, he's playing himself, for goodness sake) did have me scratching my head.  And don't blink or you'll miss a cameo by wily veteran Beverly D'Angelo playing a madam of a Texas brothel.  Again, it's all contrived, some of it's gross, and all the weed nonsense got old really quick, yet HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANOMO BAY is part of a dime-a-dozen niche of silly comedies.

3169421,2,B0017ANAX6,"The original Harold and Kumar wrapped insightful satire of the ethnic stereotypes and prejudices in American society with lowbrow humor and absurdly over-the-top situations.  The result was a sleeper hit and a cult phenomenon.

This movie focuses mainly on zany antics and (especially in the unrated version) extremely low-brow humor.  Is there satire of our cultural stereotypes and preconceptions?  Yes, there are ham-handed and obvious swipes at ""issues."" In this movie, however, rather than being a thoughtful subtext, they seem to be a desperate attempt to redeem a movie that is otherwise not worth watching.

That's exactly what this Harold and Kumar movie does.  How SHOCKING was it that freakin' Doogie Howser makes an appearance, and is actually very offensive with his words and his actions.  I can't tell you how many times I laughed while watching this outrageously over the top comedy.

Sure, there's some offensive lines in the movie, but it's all in... bad taste, haha.  I love these kind of comedies.

A couple of my favorite moments-

- One of the friends brings weed on an airplane, and starts smoking it in the bathroom, and people think he's a terrorist planning to attack.  The two friends get thrown to the ground with guns pointed at their heads and look at each other.

- The two guys meet a guy while visiting the south, and they nearly get shot when deer blood splashes on their face!

- In the beginning one of the friends was doing a naughty thing in bed, and his face gets... I can't say because it's gross!

- When they go to prison and have to eat meat sandwiches, lol.

- When they break out of prison and happen to see a boat waiting to take them back to America.

- Doogie Howser unicorns!

- Just UNBELIEVABLE seeing Doogie Howser act COMPLETELY different than you'd ever expect him to act, haha.

- Doogie Howser dying in a dramatic way.

- No panties at the party.  YES!",1233964800,,1520,4.352313167259786

Now, I will say I wish I could see the ""rated"" version, or have had it included on the disc as well, because if it got rid of the ""gratuitous"" sex and nudity scenes, it would probably been more watchable.  Most of the gratuitous scenes aren't really funny and are very awkward.  The funniest moments are the cleanest, although they really seem to want to beat you over the head with dispelling racial stereotypes while making fun of them.

Kal Penn and John Cho perform admirably with the material provided, and, although I was glad to see Neil Patrick Harris again, his part was more shock value than funny this time around.",1232496000,,792,4.5174825174825175

I am not sure if Harold and Kumar are trying to follow in Cheech and Chongs footsteps but if they are they have a long way to go.  I watched the unrated version and besides for scene where everyone is bottomless it seemed to play as the original.  This movie is at best worth one viewing and probably best scene as a rental.

3169430,4,B0017ANAX6,"First off, I have to say that, IMO, the first one was better.  It's usually true of sequels, so that shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone.  As for the movie?  Many of the jokes were crude and/or offensive to any number of religous/ethnic/political/ect. groups and/or peoples.  But, you know what, if you can't take a joke then that's too bad, so although the jokes might be offensive, I don't think anyone should take offense.  That being said, if you saw and liked the first movie, this is essentially more of the same.  Harold and Kumar are the same likable loosers they were in the first film... and they're still getting high.  Also, they're still getting lost.  It's still funny though.  Oh, and NPH steals the show.  Again.

I mean many of the stereotypes explored in this film are rather stupid. So laughing at them makes them even stupider which shows that racism is, indeed, stupid.

Having said that there is a poltical statement from jump street in this film. Harold and Kumar are sent to Gitmo because they're believed to be terrortist, despite their protests. If that's not saying something then I don't know what is. Their parents are treated awfully, which is again another statement.

In fact this movie could be considered a political comedy, but it's not. It's still got the weed, but to a less degree this time than in the first.

Everyone is cast really well in this. I was happy to see John Reep(as I think he's rather funny) and he was spot on playing a Southern redneck you'll actually like.(Which, even though he's a Southerner, isn't as easy as you may think.)

I would hope to be seeing a third film, but if not two is just fine with me. They're going to be classic, stupid comedies.",1223337600,,1143,4.480769230769231

3169439,4,B0017ANAX6,"This movie was far better than I expected it to be.  The critics did not give it its just desserts largely because of its use of many of the same themes and gags from their first movie, i.e., a supposed lack of originality.  I disagree.  The sequel builds on and successfully uses what it created in the first movie.  It is essentially about how bad things constantly happen to two well-meaning but chemically challenged bunglers, who despite their many flaws, are the good guys in the movie.  It is underrated as a satire as it pokes fun at the sheer boneheadedness of those responsible for such moral and legal travesties as Gitmo, instead of simply portraying them as wrong.  It is ultimately meant to be funny, not a political lesson, however, and it usually achieves its goal, although it does rely more on the use of nudity and graphic ""shock and awe"" techniques than the previous movie.  I disagree with those characterizing it as advocating drug use.  No one could see how these two goofballs screw up their lives (such as getting sent to Gitmo because of Kumar's hi-tech bong) and rationally want to emulate them, anymore than watching a trainwreck would make one want to be in one.  It is satirical slapstick that is both funny and ultimately goodhearted as it drives home the inner goodness of its unlikely heroes after they find two strong women to help straighten-out the messes they have created of their lives!",1220918400,11,1425,4.713709677419355

Luckily during a prison riot, they escape and head back to the U.S. where they go on a journey to clear their names, do battle with the KKK, meet Neil Patrick Harris again and also head to Texas to stop the wedding of Kumar's ex-lover who is about to marry a scumbag.

Nicely done sequel to the brilliant 2004 cult stoner comedy! it's not as excellent as the first installment but this still does offer un-Politically Correctness throughout, sleaze and some good laughs. The film does co-star Danielle Harris, Roger Bart, Beverly D'Angelo and Rob Cordry in this wild and riotous follow-up with sexy hotties that both topless and bottomless too and offers a good message on racism but in a comical kind of way.

Between the gratuitous sexual scenes which were neither erotic or sexy but rather a nightmare from a maladjusted twelve year old's mentality, to some Government official wiping his bum with the Bill of Rights [just plain gross and not at all funny]; this so called feature film rests at the very lowest of the bottom feeders from greedy film studios to make a quick buck off a substandard sequel to an originally creative effort.

I thought ""Harold & Kumar go to White Castle"" was a well written contemporary ""young"" comedy which actually displayed some wit at times as well as good comedic acting [loved the racoon attack in the car].

But this movie is just plain embarassing and has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES on ANY LEVEL, despite your age, gender, or cultural background.  It is toilet humour at it's worst, and would make the most obnoxious elementary schoolyard jerk you can remember back then just plain blush.

Such an opportunity to something truly creative with an established fan base was literally ""flushed down the drain"" by the Producers and the Writers of this rediculous crap. They should be ashamed of themselves.

The first one was kind of under the radar until it did well in rentals and made its way onto cable.  This one was obviously given a bigger budget, and they not only kept all the raunch of the first movie, but expanded upon it.  Neil Patrick Harris was a scream in the first movie as it was totally unexpected to see him act like a drug-taking, alcohol swilling, sex fiend.  He shows up in this movie as well, but the shock of seeing Doogie Howser in such a manner has kind of worn off.  The movie is still funny, albeit stupid.  The jokes are rather easy to see coming, but that doesn't matter.  If you like Rated R comedies like they used to make in the early 80's, you'll enjoy this movie.  The situations Harold and Kumar wind up in are unlikely, but who cares?  How likely were the situations in Animal House?

3169451,2,B0017ANAX6,"After thoroughly enjoying their mission to White Castle, my girlfriend and I were so excited that Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.  Unfortunately, we are disappointed.  The director of White Castle, Danny Leiner, isn't the director of this project.  Instead the writers from the first installment, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, also tackle the directing.  Within the first five minutes of the movie, it is obvious the new directors aren't as good as the first. Between watching Kumar reach a very productive climax to seeing Neil Patrick Harris gruesomely gunned down, I have to recommend not watching the Unrated Version.  What made White Castle such a good movie was the comedic timing of Kal Penn and John Cho; their facial expressions to the ridiculous lines or situations they encountered were priceless.  White Castle was funny without having cringe moments.  In Guantanamo Bay, it seems the writers/ directors were more focused on showing body parts and waste than allowing Harold and Kumar have a funny and crazy time getting out of their most recent jam.",1219622400,,1081,5.142857142857143

In a desperate attempt to appeal to young males as its target audience, it features grossness-- such as explosive diaherra, killing Bambi, inbreeding, and gratutious, bottomless (as opposed to topless) parties-- in place of humor. White Castle made us laugh as it took us on the road to nerdiness,kindness,impossible situations and improbable coolness. In this film, all of that is replaced by prison rape, dopers and a sadistic Dougy Hooser. Where did they ever get the idea that misogyny was funny?

3169458,4,B0017ANAX6,"Okay, I heard that this movie was really not funny or it wasn't as good as the original. After just seeing it all I can say is: WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS!

What a pleasant surprise! This film continues the further adventures of two racially stereotyped college students days shortly after their adventures from the first film. However due to Kal Penn's Kumar who just can't live without weed for one second, even though he and best pal John Cho's Harold are headed to Amsterdam where weed is legal in the first place, are caught with a bong on the plane that quickly gets mistaken for a bomb. Enter a racially moronic Federal officer (very funny) played by Rob Corddry, and the two get sent to the famous Guantanamo Bay....

..and by the title of the film alone you'd figure it was all about dealing with life in that prison, dont'cha? Wrong again. That title is misleading because this is another H&K road trip movie, because they're outta the Bay within the movie's first fifteen minutes. The rest of the movie involves getting back to America, encountering tons of stereotypes of race in different ways, saving Kumar's ex from a jerk, and a ton of other very humorous people and things along the way. Don't let the title fool you, there's alot more to this movie than a remake of ""Let's Go To Prison"".

Now I wasn't that huge of a fan of the first movie other than thinking it was okay at best, but Bay beats it by leaps and bounds. I must have laughed twenty to thirty good times watching it. And with the disc I choose the Unrated version and for a comedy, this one really, really pushes the limit on that term. There's some scenes in it I can't believe would be allowed on any Family Superstore's shelf. And believe me, it ain't all pot jokes either, and in fact I felt that got downplayed for other funny subjects quite well here.

So look, this movie isn't the Animal House or Up In Smoke of this generation in overall quality but bottom line, it's very funny. I couldn't believe a sequel to a movie that didn't blow me away the first time could make me laugh like this one and I didn't roll my eyes in bad-joke despair not once here. It is NOT as bad as some have made it out to be and I feel it's about time we can all laugh at each others cultural differences in film again without truly being hurtful. Definitely worth a view/rent, and maybe a purchase when both films are maybe sold together. Glad to see Harold & Kumar back, see you two again in Part III.

Cheech and Chong didn't exactly make the critics write glowing reviews either so don't expect any now for Harold and Kumar. Their comedy doesn't appeal to most movie critics. This movie doesn't have the freshness of the two characters in the first movie, but it still delivers on some funny moments. Harold and Kumar while flying to Amsterdam are accused of being terrorists and are shipped off to Guantanamo Bay. Their escape and return home is a bit different type of road movie. I think you may see a bit of resurgence in this type humor because even Cheech and Chong are giving it another go. The humor is just a nice mix of adult humor, slapstick, and pothead jokes. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"", ""White Chicks"", and ""Airplane"". - C. Luster",1218067200,4,988,4.67816091954023

This movie however is totally inappropriate. It is filled with extreme nudity and inapprorpiate content. My nephew watched the first movie and wanted to see this one, I figured it would be similar comedy and. Nope, this was totally in approrpriate compared to the first movie. I am not sure what happens near the end because I turned it off before it got half way through.

If you are looking for good family comedy look elsewhere. If you are looking for nudity (and lots of it), sexual references (and lots of it) then check this movie out.

Basically what it does is while you're watching the movie, it'll pause at certain sections and you can literally change the movie. When you're on the plane, should kumar ""endulge"" himself or wait til he gets to amsterdam? Do you wanna see harolds dream or kumars? ...and probably the best, topless or bottomless? and these aren't little changes.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is raunchy, sleazy and just plain gross at times...these two guys definitely get to push the limits of decency in the name of comedy!

3169464,3,B0017ANAX6,"While I highly enjoyed the first chapter in this saga, I was a little disappointed by the second. Harold and Kumar are refreshing comic protagonists for our times, especially as they defeat racial stereotypes of nerdy, no-fun Asians. The first film succeeded because of this fresh, new quality, while their quest for the perfect burger merged elements of crass commercialism, slavering bong-fixated hunger and actual wit...I actually became a little fixated on the first film, along with friends of mine. It has a cult feeling, is something that can be enjoyed again and again, is well-structured and very, very funny. Not so much ""Escape from Guantanimo Bay."" Everything that was funny and original about ""White Castle"" is retread and rehashed (pun intended) in this one. The only thing that could possibly kill the insoucient power of the franchise is to serve it up again, with diminishing returns. While ""White Castle"" is hardly ""Citizen Kane,"" it has surprising depth; in fact, I've conducted an ongoing structural analysis of ""White Castle"" in relation to Joseph Campbell's hero's journey paradigm, and it is truly a heroic quest narrative...I don't think we need another installment of Harold and Kumar, bottom line. The first was very clever and entertaining, the second plays it safe, which is no fun at all. Not to say there aren't moments in ""Escape from Gitmo""--the 'manmeat sandwich' scene, the initial scene on the plane to Amsterdam, when Kumar's bong is mistaken for a bomb...obvious and predictable stuff, but I laughed.

This schtick has all been done before, but I guess today's generation needs their very own Cheech and Chong and Harold and Kumar fit the bill.

Each new encounter they come across is pretty funny and they make a good team, glad to see there will be a part 3.",1217721600,3,399,3.9382716049382718
3169467,1,B0017ANAX6,"Utterly lacking the charm of the first movie, this one bypassed the clever and jumped straight to the crass. It's guilty of the worst sin of bad comedy: making us feel embarrassed or disgusted rather than giving us something funny. I guess the idea is that nervous laughter is as good as real laughter. But to me, that ain't comedy. For example: Kumar masturbating in his bed and ejaculating on himself; or Harold & Kumar being forced to fellate a prison guard. I suppose either situation might have been made funny, but they weren't. We were merely expected to laugh at the outrageousness of seeing these things in a movie. Genius.

Not to say the movie didn't have some genuinely funny stuff in it, but mostly it was just tedious. So unless you think films like American Pie III are the pinnacle of comedy, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1217721600,7,847,4.572368421052632
3169468,4,B0017ANAX6,"Harold & Kumar are the Y2K+ equivalent of the 1970's stoner's Cheech & Chong.  Harold & Kumar are more obviously intelligent than their predecessors, and Kumar has a bad attitude and smart mouth that gets he and his friend into much more trouble than C&C could ever seem to find, but the parallels are there to easily be drawn.

Escape from Guantanamo Bay, (H&K2 for all intents and purposes), picks up where the first movie (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle or H&K1) stopped, almost literally.  As the film starts 'rold-y is in the shower cleaning up and preparing to take a flight to Amsterdam to go chase down the gal of his dreams.  As that goes on, well, let's just say that Kumar isn't shy about using the facilities at the same time.

Before going further, understand what you are getting if you pick up this film -- it's not meant to be high society artistic genius, it's lowest common denominator humor and it hit's that target fairly well.

The humor is stereotypical and telegraphed from miles away, but is still funny if you aren't too uptight to appreciate and/or acknowledge it.  There are visual gags (sayings on T-shirts and such), verbal gags and more, misunderstandings that lead to problems, and then there are more misunderstandings on the part of the clueless government employees involved in dealing with the initial misunderstandings.  There are plenty of drug references and portrayals of drug usage, and plenty of gratituitous nudity thrown in as well -- both male and female.

Watch it if you can lower yourself to the right level.  Otherwise skip it and consider yourself too intelligent for something so low brow.",1217635200,4,1644,4.797872340425532
3169469,1,B0017ANAX6,"I must admit I've never seen `Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle'.  Because of it's cult classic status, I have some real regrets.  Except as I go into `Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanomo Bay,' I can at least evaluate this movie without being biased by the former film.

I found this sequel to be repulsive, so I'll try to be as brief as possible.  I first want to say that I've seen, reviewed, and/or recommended `Superbad,' '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Guantanamo/dp/B000HOL67U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Guantanamo</a>,' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prisoner-or-How-I-Planned-to-Kill-Tony-Blair/dp/B000OU3WYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair</a>'.  I've also highly recommended `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart/dp/B000VBB6F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart</a>,' `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-Tapes/dp/B000O76ZOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War Tapes</a>,' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Homecoming-Writing-the-Wartime-Experience/dp/B000WOSB0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Homecoming - Writing the Wartime Experience</a>,' so it doesn't matter what political spectrum the movie plays.  If it's a good movie, it's a good movie.

Plot:  Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) go to Amsterdam while lusting for two beauties:  Vanessa (Danneel Harris), a college sweetheart with whom Kal split two years earlier, and Maria (Paula Garc&eacute;s), Harold's model interest.  On the plane, Kumar, who can't wait to get to where the grass is green and flowing, lights a ""smokeless"" bong to share with Harold in the airplane bathroom.  When caught, ""racial profiling"" makes the people on the flight panic, thinking the bong is a bomb.  Diverted back to the U.S., both face imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay.  From there they escape and episodically travel from Miami to Texas hoping to stop Vanessa from making her vows to pure-bred overbearing bore, Colton (Eric Winter).

Execution:  As original as `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat-Cultural-Learnings-of-America-for-Make-Benefit-Glorious-Nation-of-Kazakhstan-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000MMMT9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (Full Screen Edition)</a>' was, `...Escape from Guantanamo Bay' is a slap-in-the-face imitation, a stoner road movie without all the impromptu filming of real people.

A conservative objection:  This is all blather, tongue-in-cheek anger dressed up as comedy.

A liberal objection:  ""Imagine"" a 1:40 comedy with Archie Bunker (Home Security Agent Fox [Rob Corddry]) yelling most of the time with very few funny jokes.  This is deadly for our issues.  Al Franken didn't become a #1 best-selling author for nothing!

A humorist objection:  If 80% of your material is angry sarcasm, can it still be funny?

Example:  Agent Fox uses the Fifth Amendment as toilet paper.  Wha Ha Ha!  (Yes, this movie's a satire.)

Redeeming Traits:  There's a funny scene where a woman on the airplane distorts seeing Kumar as an Arab jihadist.  There's another funny scene after they condemn the Ku Klux Klan as ""racist dogs,"" we see a Spuds MacKenzie look-alike in a white hood.  The themes are laudable.  ""Racial profiling"" is not acceptable.  There are tender moments, but while they're more sincere than `Shallow Hal,' they're also about as exceptional.

Trying to be consistent, I must say the timing of `Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay' is measurably better than `Meet the Spartans,' but at least that parody rendered a few more laughs.

3169470,4,B0017ANAX6,"There's no question Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is arguably one of the dumbest comedies you will ever see. Little of it makes sense and none of it is actually possible. Well, I can't say none of it, but most of it is highly unlikely. And yet, the movie has some of the funniest (and most disturbing) scenes you'll ever see on screen. There's what has to be the film world's first bottomless party. There's a 3-way between Kumar, his ex-girlfriend and a large bag of weed (which, like most of the movie, starts of funny, gets funnier, then turns exceedingly disturbing). And there's President Bush toking up with our two anti-heroes. And in between there's all sorts of humor, much of it drug or race related.

Rob Corddry plays an FBI agent hunting down Harold and Kumar, and he may be the most racist person you'll ever see in a movie. Everyone who isn't white (and Catholic) is a suspect, and the manner in which he goes about trying to get information is painfully racist and funny. Whether it's grape soda and a black witness, or nickels to a Jewish pair of friends (who you'll recognize from the original film), he'll do whatever it takes to get Harold and Kumar and send them back to prison.

Yes, the movie title involves them escaping from the notorious prison in Cuba, but that portion of the film lasts all of five minutes. And even though the movie starts 5 minutes after the first one ends, the movie isn't really about them going to Amsterdam to find Harold's love. The movie really turns into a cross country trip to Texas to try and clear their names. From Cuba to Miami, through Alabama and Louisiana, the potheads we love to love have to get through all manner of obstacles to try and get to a former classmates wedding, so he can use his connections to save them. Along the way Kumar sees an ex-girlfriend, who coincidentally is getting married to their classmate. He realizes on the spot he's still in love with her, so getting to the wedding now has more purpose. Oh, and of course, Neil Patrick Harris is still driving aimlessly around the country and runs into the guys again. This leads to a scene at a whorehouse, and a shocking conclusion. By the way, don't leave the theater too quickly when the movie ends. Stay for the credits so you don't miss the very end of the film.

I laughed throughout most of the film, groaned in a couple of places, and had to say 'Oh God!' a couple of times as well. The people in the theater were a strange mix because while most loved it, there were a few who just sat there stonefaced. Why would anyone go to this movie and sit there with a blank look on their face? What did they expect? An Oscar-worthy film? This movie is rude and crude, disgusting and hilarious.

I appreciate the fact most characters return for a second romp and add more flare and hilarity.  N.P.H. is hilarious, more crude than before but it works.  Harold and Kumar's relationships seems familiar and yet they progressed as characters acknowledging each others faults.  And saying sorry.  There are several memorable moments that are to taboo to explain here but if you saw the first you know what you're in for.  Did it live up to the hype? Yes.  Did it add more to the series? Yes.  Was it as good as the first? No.  It doesn't have to.  This film is a continuation of the first so it had to progress right? So watch this movie and enjoy another crazy adventure.

3169480,4,B0017ANAX6,"Keeping mostly in tone with Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is a solid sequel that delivers the laughs and gross out gags that one would come to expect.  The sequel picks up where the original left off with Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) on their way to Amsterdam, until the two get mistaken for terrorists and are locked away in Guantanamo Bay.  After escaping, the duo find themselves as fugitives on the run from a racist and dim-witted government agent (The Daily Show's Rob Cordry), and go on a cross-country journey to Texas for the hope of getting help from the politically-laced fiance' (Eric Winter) of Kumar's ex-girlfriend (gorgeous Danneel Harris) whom he is still in love with.  On the way though, there's all kinds of chaos, including running into the KKK (led by Christopher Meloni no less, minus the Freakshow makeup), mutant children, and Neil Patrick Harris (returning as himself).  While Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay isn't quite as enjoyable as the first film, it still delivers the goods that fans of the first film are looking for, and while it does become pretty predictable compared to the original as it winds down, it still packs enough laughs to keep you interested.  All in all, if you got any enjoyment at all out of Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, you'll more than likely dig what you find here.",1217289600,6,1393,4.692622950819672
3169481,3,B0017ANAX6,"Two bright guys with promising futures submit to immaturity to keep them in a perpetual state of arrested development.  Sound familiar?  At least a few dozen other slacker-stoner comedies have created variations on the simple formula, but perhaps none had the sleeper status of Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.  Naturally when one is riding high (no pun intended) from such unanticipated home video success, the only logical thing to do is spurn out a sequel; thus was born the slightly superfluous Harold & Kumar 2: Escape From Guantanamo Bay.

Picking up mere moments after the first one left off, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) scramble to make a flight, following their neighbor Maria (Paula Garc&eacute;s) to Amsterdam.  After causing a bit of a stink at the airport, the guys get suspected of being terrorists on the plane when an overly concerned passenger hears them say ""bomb"" instead of ""bong.""  Things only take a turn for the even more absurd (if that's possible!) from there when they escape from Guantanamo Bay, encounter a tripped-out N.P.H., and detour to try to break up a wedding.  Laughs are shared, but much of the film, including a moment with a foreign hick and his too-attractive-to-be-attracted-to-him wife, feel ripped straight out of the original, begging the question of why another version was necessary.

The answer to that may come in the way of supporting characters Vanessa and Colton (Danneel Harris and Eric Winter, respectively), though, whose characters have histories with both boys and who take center focus (even if not a lot of screen-time).  While Kumar struggles to win Vanessa back, Harold just wants Colton's important political ties to help get exonerated.  Harold & Kumar 2: Escape From Guantanamo Bay, therefore, very quickly transitions from a road trip comedy (as the title suggests) to one of a very different variety: a romantic comedy.  The problem is that none of the male/female pairings have the strong chemistry audiences have come to expect from a Harold & Kumar movie when compared to the incredible buddy relationship of the title's lead stars.  Winter is supposed to be a villain, which is blatantly obvious when he gives his fianc&eacute; a lecture of her found joint, but his slick suits, perfect bone structure, and wide smile make it hard to even dislike the guy, especially considering his character has his act together.  Oddly, viewers may find themselves looking at Harold and Kumar in a new light with this film: they are not carefree kids who can afford to mess around, but rather they are adults with responsibilities, and when they don't act accordingly, it's hard to find them sympathetic.

Co-writers-turned-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg certainly banked on the original film's largest draw: N.P.H.--I'm sorry, it just feels wrong to call him by his full name now--resurrecting a slightly self-deprecating version of himself to plant butts in seats this second-chance time around.  In Harold & Kumar 2, it feels like all of their energy went towards giving him something new and outlandish to do, while the rest of the film relied on fart jokes and clouds of smoke.  At times you may even find yourself just waiting for his arrival on-screen and breathing a hefty sigh of relief once he finally is.  Unfortunately, his mere moments come to an end far too quickly, and then you are left with almost an hour of bleakosity to get through to the end.

Harold & Kumar 2: Escape from Guantanamo Bay offers a wide variety of extras, probably assuming once again it's greatest audience will be the home viewer.  And they will certainly not be disappointed with the selection!  ""Dude, Change The Movie!"" is the most fascinating, as an interactive features that allows the home viewer to select from alternative scenes to change the sequence of events within the feature.  Reminiscent of one of those ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" childhood books, this feature is simple enough that even the most baked viewers (and let's face it, it appears the directors assumed most would be) can take part.  There are also two optional commentaries, with words from both directors, the inspiration behind John Cho's character, and George W. Bush impersonator James Adomian, who also appears in his own special feature: Bush PSA.  ""The World of Harold & Kumar"" is a fun-filled behind-the-scenes featurette, and there are an astounding twenty-seven! deleted scenes from which to choose.",1217203200,3,4458,5.035374149659864

* I then bought the DVD of the original movie, which I had not seen. I thought that the original movie was good, but that ""Escape"" was twice as funny.

* Anyone who's lived through the heartbreak and shame of the Cheney-Bush years will welcome a chance to laugh at the insanity they've inflicted on us.

Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! It captured the same, utter ridiculousness from the first movie, but made a completely fresh and funny two hours. The beginning was a bit slow, but once it got going, I laughed until the end. If you liked the first one, I think you'll love this one too.

3169484,3,B0017ANAX6,Although I love the Harold and Kumar movies I was rather disappointed in this one. I wqs expecting it to be as funny if not better than the first one and it surely wasn't. It was silly and not that funny.,1212451200,,204,4.0
3169485,5,B0017ANAX6,"Wow. Many of you totally missed the point of the movie. The George W. Bush thing was saying that he is just a regular guy and isn't all evil, but just has a lot of daddy problems (i.e. 'Finishing off' what George Bush Sr. started with the war that we are in right now).

The shots at the DHS are about how they are stripping away our rights and label whoever they can 'terrorists' just so they could seem like heroes, when in reality many innocent people are being harmed in the process.

Guantanamo Bay...well, that was more or less a joke about how we torture all of those people there (don't tell me that we don't, because you know what is going on there but choose to ignore it). I guess it could seem in bad taste, because it was one of those toilet humor jokes, but it was implying that sucking Big Bob's dick was worse than being waterboarded.

The white person thing, well a lot of America is mostly white, and everyone takes things for granted. Many live in rich neighborhoods and have high-paying jobs while there are Black people with the same qualifications but are discriminated against because there is still racism in this world. Also, if you actually watched the movie, not all white people in it were stupid. Do you recall the helicopter scene when that one DHS agent knocked over Ron Fox, aimed a gun at him, then yelled about how everyone knows that Harold and Kumar are innocent but were just idiots, and that he was too stupid to realize that? I wouldn't call that stupid.

Any questions?",1211587200,6,1509,4.456521739130435
3169486,4,B0017ANAX6,"HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE...is a very funny movie, and I laughed a great deal.  That's a good thing.

It's also sloppy, careless and goes for too many obvious or clichd jokes.  That's a shame.

It's too bad, because what we have in these two guys is a wonderful blend of what's best and worst about young Americans.  They are smart.  They are multi-ethnic.  In general, they are good-hearted and appreciate the chance to live in America.  They're also lazy, self-indulgent and far too easily distracted by drugs.  This makes their movies ripe for social commentary.

Too often, though, they take the easy way out with cheap jokes and predictable visual puns.

The movie shows us these two goofballs (and if you haven't seen #1...you must see it first...#2 literally picks up the morning after WHITE CASTLE), setting out on a trip to Holland, so that Harold can follow a girl he's hot for and Kumar can enjoy the legal drugs.  But when Kumar brings a hi-tech bong on the plane, it's mistaken for a bomb and the two are mistaken for terrorists.  This bit is probably the funniest stuff in the film.  It's weirdly credible that passengers might take these two unruly and ""un-white"" Americans for terrorists...not just because they don't ""look like us"" but because they sneak into restroom together and then appear with a dangerous looking device.  Much is also made of the world ""bong"" sounding a lot like ""bomb.""  As in, ""I've got a bong!  No, no...I said bong!!""

My wife and I were pretty much laughing our rear ends off at this point.  Then Harold and Kumar are incarcerated in Guantanamo, and the movie quickly reaches it's low-point.  The American guards are all rapists and idiots.  So, at this point, we were wondering if we could continue to sit through these cheap and unfair jokes about the young men and women in our military.  Have many of them done disgusting and illegal things?  Yes.  Have MOST of them?  Absolutely not...yet scenes like these propagate the idea that our soldiers are a bunch of oral sex crazed, torturing thugs.

Fortunately, the two boys escape quite soon, and we're able to follow their adventures as they try for vindication.  I won't spoil any more of the plot...but suffice it to say that from this point on, the jokes become wildly uneven.  Some scenes are quite funny (there's a scene with a deer that had me in stitches) and others are FLAAAATTT!  A scene at a wealthy friend's house in Florida springs to mind.

Neil Patrick Harris reprises his role as himself...and he's nearly as funny and surprising as last time...although far cruder.  It was almost too much of a good thing.

The movie takes some clever shots at the current political climate...but mostly it follows the same crude path as its predecessor.

The two young leads are quite enjoyable and easy to warm up to.  Kal Penn, in particular, has some promise (see THE NAMESAKE)...I hope he can shake off this role.  Otherwise, the movie is low-budget and stylistically simple.

As a 44 year old man, I fully recognize that I'm not the target for this film.  Yet I enjoyed it enough to laugh a great deal, and to say now that I would recommend it...but only if you've seen and enjoyed #1.  If you hated #1...you won't like ESCAPE any better.  This movie plays right to its core audience...for better or worse.",1210291200,14,3307,4.685217391304348
3169487,3,B0017ANAX6,"Harold and Kumar are back and this time they get accused of being terrorists because Kumar sneaked a weird looking bong on a plane. They get sent to Guantanamo Bay but they are barely even there. It's not a prison comedy, it's a road trip comedy just like the original. But it has less charm than the original. It trys to get laughs with many prejudice jokes. While it has so much nudity with male and female lower parts shown that it should've been NC-17.

  While on the run from the Feds Kumar plans to break up the wedding of an ex-girlfriend but Harold is against that since the groom has political power and can help clear their names. The movie is over-stuffed and over-stays it's welcome but it still made me laugh even if the original was funnier and has more of a head on it's shoulder. Neil Patrick Harris makes a funny appearance as...Neil Patrick Harris again though and he provides some of the funnier moments of the movie. While a Bush impersonator as Bush gets some laughs just due to his lines and not because he looks anything like Bush. While the movie made me laugh, I recommend Forgetting Sarah Marshall over it.",1209600000,3,1133,4.490291262135922
3403770,4,B0017ANAX6,"This film contains, male and female frontal nudity (might be an apron), foul language, smoking, sexual content, gross humor.  Rated ""R"".
  It's been nearly 4 years that we have waited for this sequel to Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle (2004). It was actually filmed in January to March of 2007. It was originally meant to be a straight-to-DVD release, however they decided to release it in the theaters, April 25, 2008.
  The great comedic chemistry between Kal Penn and John Cho returns in ""Harold & Kumar Escape to Guantanamo Bay"".
  Also returning with Kal Penn and John Cho are Paula Garces as ""Maria"", David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Christopher Meloni, Neil Patrick Harris, Errol Sitahal.
  The writers of the first film, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have written and directed this second film.
  This second movie begins on the same day where the first movie ended. Since Harold (John Cho) has finally spoken and kissed the girl he had been fantasizing about, but was too closed-up to speak to her before, he needs to see her again, but she is on her way to Amsterdam, Netherlands for 10 days.  Kumar (Kal Penn) rescheduled his job interview and has booked a flight for both of them to Amsterdam, so that Harold can find Maria (Paula Garces).
  When do these guys ever sleep?
  At the airport, Kal sees an old girlfriend, Vanessa (Danneel Harris) who is getting married soon.
  The flight doesn't go off without a hitch thanks to Kumar and his smoking pipe invention.  An old lady passenger gets disturbed and Harold & Kumar are arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay jail.
  As the title of this film suggests, they do escape and this leads them on another mis-hap adventure.
  Beverly D'Angelo makes an appearance as ""Sally"".
  To see a surprise scene, you must wait until after the end credits.
  Not as funny as the first film. Some scenes are just too unbelievable too be funny. The movie plays like a mushroom dream, but then again so did the Cheech & Chong movies.
  I hope Kal Penn and John Cho continue to make many movies together. They are a good comedic team.

3403774,1,B0017ANAX6,"Being a big fan of the first Harold and Kumar, I had high expectations for this sequel.  I had heard some initial negative reviews, but still went to the theater, wanting very badly to like it.  Sadly, it was not to be.  By the end, I was ashamed to be in the theater--I felt offended, cheated, and even a little nauseated.  This film was incredibly lame and had almost none of the charm of the original.  Its almost as if the writers went out their way to make it brain dead.

Some specifics:
1.  Many of the bits were blatently recycled from the original (like the weird couple living in the woods), but just weren't funny this time around.  There was also a much greater reliance on toilet humor than in the first.
2.  Almost everyone who was a white male was portrayed as stupid, racist, or both.
3.  The Guantanamo Bay scenes were in incredibly bad taste--especially the bit about the ""sandwiches"" fed to the prisoners.  Sorry, but implying that military guards pull that stuff goes way beyond being not funny--it is highly offensive and insulting to those who wear the uniform.
4.  Some of the same characters show up again.  While this could have been cool, especially the Neil Patrick Harris cameo, it turned out to be pointless and incoherent.
5.  And, of course, the obligatory scenes making George Bush look like a drug addled moron.  I'm sure the writers had to work really hard to come up with those.

Bottom Line:  If you liked the original, stay away--far away--from this awful sequel.",1209254400,17,1500,4.6

These two are so funny and play off one another to perfection.  One, Harold, plays the uptight and wants to color inside of the lines and Kumar will try anything and colors outside of the lines every chance he gets and does it with believing that the people around him are really not trying to harm them in any way.  He gets surprised and Harold is right there to remind him of the errors of his ways.  These two are the ""Cheech and Chong"" characters from the 80's and you laugh out loud at the situations that they get into trying to get out of another.

3403867,3,B0017ANAX6,"I thought the movie was actually pretty funny. I only saw the regular version, not the unrated one. So this complaint relates to that film. Any fan of pop culture who is even remotely aware of current cable shows or mainstream R-Rated films has to have noticed how the penis is now shown IN EVERYTHING. From shows like Spartacus to films like Hall Pass. And not just fleeting glimpses of male genitals but sometimes extended CLOSE UPS (just watch American Reunion).

Yet for reasons I can't fathom, a woman's vagina (technically the vulva, or lips of the vagina) is ALWAYS CENSORED. This movie does just that. In the ""Bottomless Party"" scene when the woman answers the door nude,the camera zooms to her crotch. She is obviously wearing a merkin (fake pubic hair to cover the vagina). The producers of the film later admitted this.

Why in the world do we see the penis in the most graphic manner possible, including the ""Harold & Kumar"" films, yet a woman's crotch will always be censored. Ever since women started grooming in a style that would reveal the vagina if seen nude it is now standard practice for Hollywood to censor the vagina with the utilization of a merkin (pubic wig). Other than Rosario Dawson in ""Trance"" every female full nude scene on cable shows or in films, ALWAYS has the woman wearing some kind of merkin.

We see extended close-ups of the penis in mainstream films like ""Bruno"" yet a crotch shot of a woman in this film is censored. Just once I would love to see female nudity as graphic as the male nudity. It seems that the basic rule of thumb for any R-Rated comedy is that ""female nudity will be limited to just breasts, but as for male nudity we will show actual genitals, sometimes even in a close-up. It is a very bizarre double standard that really needs to end",1383091200,,1795,4.568322981366459

Directed and written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg.

 Originally Rated ""R"". This is the UNRATED version.  Contains male and female frontal nudity (might be an apron), foul language, smoking, sexual content and gross humor.

  It has been nearly 4 years we have waited for this sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-Kumar-Go-to-White-Castle-Extreme-Unrated-Edition/dp/B00068WOH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Extreme Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2004). It was actually filmed in January to March 2007. It was originally meant to be a straight-to-DVD release, however they changed their minds and released it in the movie theaters April 25, 2008. Thank goodness.
  The great comedic chemistry between Kal Penn and John Cho returns in ""Harold & Kumar Escape to Guantanamo Bay"". Also returning are Paula Garces as ""Marie"", David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Christopher Meloni, Neil Patrick Harris, Errol Sitahal.
 The writers of the first film, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have written and directed this second film.
  This movie begins on the same day where the first movie ended. Since Harold (John Cho) has finally spoken and kissed the young woman he had been fantasizing about, but was too closed-up to speak to her before, he needs to see her again, however, she is on her way to Amsterdam, Netherlands for 10 days.
 Kumar (Kal Penn) rescheduled his job interview and has booked a flight for both of them to Amsterdam so Harold can find Maria (Paula Garces).
 When do these guys sleep?
 At the airport, Kal sees an old girlfriend, Vanessa (Danneel Harris) who is getting married.
 The flight doesn't go off without a hitch, thanks to Kumar and his smoking pipe invention. An old lady passenger (Juli Erickson) gets disturbed and Harold & Kumar are arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay jail.
 As the title of this film suggests, they do escape and this leads to another late-night adventure.

 This film contains male and female frontal nudity (might be an apron), foul language, smoking, sexual content and gross humor. Rated ""R"".

 Beverly D'Angelo makes an appearance as ""Sally"".

 Jon Hurwitz appears as the Dancing Devil in the Costume Shop and Hayden Schlossberg appears as the Dancing Monkey in the Costume Shop.

 To see a surprise scene, wait until after the end credits.

 Not as funny as the first film. Some scenes are just too unbelievable too be funny. The movie plays plays like a mushroom dream, but then again, so did the Cheech & Chong movies.
 I hope Kal Penn and John Cho continue to make many more movies together. They are a good comedic team.

3403889,4,B0017ANAX6,"Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay(released April/08)is a worthy sequel to the surprise first movie hit,H&K at the White Castle. Kumar Patel(Karl Penn)and Harold Lee(John Cho) are back as the two traveling misfits who bungle their way from one funny situation to another. Whether this sequel is up to the standards set by the first one is up for debate,but either way you come down on the issue,both are funny films to be watched with an open mind and NOT to be taken too seriously.
The film opens where the first left off as we find Harold and Kumar setting off to Amsterdam to see Harold's apartment neighbour who has flown off there previously. Of course this situation sets things up for alot of trouble/laughs ahead. Kumar,the main instigant stoner of the two,has sneaked aboard a smokeless bong and is in the bathroom trying it out. Harold enters,scolds Kumar and leaves. But the door is ajar and someone mistakes his ""appliance""for a bomb. The two end up arrested and being interrogated by a totally over obsessive Homeland Security Agent(Rob Cordry).He believes Al Quaida and the North Koreans have joined together and the two are sent where all terrorists are sent;Guantanamo Bay.
Well it is no picnic there but the two somehow manage to escape the prison and flee to the States aboard a boat of illegal Cuban immigrants. In Miami they locate a friends house to get help. From here,with a borrowed car they make their way to Texas where Kumar's ex-girlfriend is getting married. Along the way they get lost in a bad part of Birmingham,they meet up with a brother/sister-husband/wife couple with a son who has one eye,and finally they get mixed up with the KKK.As they flee they run into their old friend Neil Patrick Harris who takes them to a ""roadhouse"".
When things go south there and they are fleeing,Harris gets shot in the back by the head madam and is left for dead.
H&K finally arrive at Kumar's exe's place on her wedding day. The guy she is marrying is seemingly a good pal of Harold's,but in the end it is he who turns both of them into Homeland Security. From here it is a free plane ticket back to GB.However the two escape the plane and land smack dab into the living room of ex-President Bush at his Texas retreat. The three get along like gang busters and they are soon all toking up. In the end H&K are pardoned,presidentially of course,and with Kumar's old girlfriend in tow,all head to Amsterdam where they surprise Harold's girlfriend in a big reunion.
James Adomian does a fantastic job as president Bush and Neil Patrick Harris keeps his off the wall persona on high gear throughout the film,as he did in the first one. Of course most of the situations the two run into are tremendously far fetched,but that is the element that gives this film its spontaneity and keeps it moving. You just never know what is going to come around the next corner,as H&K are constantly reacting to this onslaught of circumstances either directly or indirectly their own fault.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. This two disc edition is the only way to go. The first disc gives you a choice between the unrated version and ""Dude,change the movie"".If you choose the latter,an on screen message will pop up during the films play and you will have the choice to skip the scene or go on with it. You also have commentary by the director and stars or commentary with the directors,John Cho and James Adomian. The second disc is loaded with extras such as a featurette on the making of the film,a Bush PSA,18 deleted scenes and nine extra deleted/alternate/outtakes.
All in all this is the best way to get the full H&K Escape from Guantanamo Bay experience. You have two ways to view it and it is loaded with extras. This sequel is a deserving one from the first and you will never find yourself waiting too long for the next laugh to come. Recommended.",1334966400,,3916,4.644092219020173

For the sensitive one, this movie will rub you the wrong way. This movie touches on every sensitive issues like racism, terrorism, stereotyping etc but it's not meant to be taken seriously. They make fun of the ridiculous sensitive issues that we are currently facing in our society.

While on the first movie you follow Harold & Kumar on their journey to find White Castle, in this movie you follow them again escaping the Guantanamo Bay. As usual they find really crazy characters along the way... KKK wannabes, in-bred son of a hillbilly family, even the president. The best character to me will always be NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. He's just legen---wait for it---DARY.

The bluray has some cool features but the best feature would be to change the story. You will be given an option at certain points to change the story or scene. If you change the first option (where Kumar smokes his bong in a plane and mistaken as terrorist) and choose not to smoke the bong, it'll change into a completely different chick-flick movie in Amsterdam!

3403896,1,B0017ANAX6,"I saw this movie when it came out and was very disappointed. Seeing the two Asian men peering through bars on the promo posters, I thought this may be an interesting insight into the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, or at least some sought of social commentary. But no, any thoughtfulness is completely squandered to complete mediocrity. And the dealing with issues of prisoner abuse are treated with such indifference as to become fodder for dirty jokes amongst young men, i.e. 'C-meat sandwich'

The fact that the leading stars of this movie are Indian and Asian is of little, if any, consequence. 'Kumar', especailly, is just another bong-smoking, navel gazing, stereotypical young loud-mouth who is either trying to score a joint or get into a chicks pants, like any character from a barrage of American road-trip movies. The only thing that saves this a little is the fact that 'Harold' is an interesting character, because his naive seriousness and COMMON SENSE is so refreshing. It's almost a reminder as to how lame all the other characters are.

The plot is basically this: the pair end up in Guan. Bay at the start of the movie, but quickly escape and the rest is predictable cliched jokes about inbreeding Hillbilly's, public sex and pointless whacko's who brand prostitutes. If you've seen the likes of Jay and Silent Bob or Dukes of Hazzard, you can fill in the blanks as you watch it.  The rating is 3/10 or 1 1/2 stars.",1304380800,,1443,4.78714859437751

*SPOILERS*

The thing that made Harold and Kumar so appealing in their first film, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" was that they were just two ordinary guys driven by the very modest goal of finding the perfect burger to satisfy their munchies.  But turn them into suspected terrorists on the lam from Homeland Security, ship them off to GITMO as detainees, and have them sharing doobies with none other than George W. Bush himself - all of which happens in ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"" - and they lose the very thing we liked best about them:  their relatability.

John Cho and Kal Penn are as disarming as ever as the endearing potheads who'll go to just about any lengths to get a good high, and Neil Patrick Harris returns in a good-natured appearance playing a satirical version of himself, but the script reduces the movie to just another dumb, disjointed, anything-for-a-laugh action comedy that is long on gross-out gags and vulgarity and short on anything even approaching genuine wit or humor.",1272153600,,1034,4.8192090395480225

The unrated DVD release has two versions of the film, but I only watched the rated version so far. It's hard to believe the unrated version could be any more raunchy or have more nudity in it?!

Despite many attempts to divert my eyes or coil in disgust at certain elements, the chemistry that Kal Penn and John Cho have is really amazing.  Its also refreshing to see a movie like this where the two lead characters are not caucasian proving that certain aspects of culture are universal (in this instance it's questionable whether it is a good or bad thing).

I'm giving Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay 3 stars instead of 4 because there were aspects of the movie and dialogue that I thought could have been better, but I had so much fun watching it... often covering my mouth and laughing in hysterics at the antics of the main characters and supporting cast.

3403908,3,B0017ANAX6,"The airwaves and DVD players are saturated with mindless, sophomoric, ribald comedies featuring a healthy preoccupation with drug use, so let's add HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANOMO BAY to the mix, shall we?  Pals Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) get mistaken for terrorists on a flight (and the satire of stereotyping is a major theme of the film) and subsequently are sent to the notorious Gitmo for some of that ""enhanced interrogation"".  A lucky escape has them back in the States and on the run from a flag-waving zealot (Rob Corddry is a funny guy), and the chase generates adventures and mayhem.  Some of it is funny, some of it is not, all of it is contrived.

An extended cameo by Neil Patrick Harris (playing himself) is certainly. . .interesting.  While his exuberant, mushroom-popping performance is dynamic, his sudden, violent demise (again, he's playing himself, for goodness sake) did have me scratching my head.  And don't blink or you'll miss a cameo by wily veteran Beverly D'Angelo playing a madam of a Texas brothel.  Again, it's all contrived, some of it's gross, and all the weed nonsense got old really quick, yet HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANOMO BAY is part of a dime-a-dozen niche of silly comedies.  Better than a kick in the pants, but not by much.

Mostly a collection of skits, it throws the pair of stoners into an ecclectic mixture of situations (the bottomless pool party, the KKK rally, the Gitmo meat sandwich, the redneck house, the whorehouse, etc. - none of which mean anything unless you've seen the movie.

That's exactly what this Harold and Kumar movie does.  How SHOCKING was it that freakin' Doogie Howser makes an appearance, and is actually very offensive with his words and his actions.  I can't tell you how many times I laughed while watching this outrageously over the top comedy.

Sure, there's some offensive lines in the movie, but it's all in... bad taste, haha.  I love these kind of comedies.

A couple of my favorite moments-

- One of the friends brings weed on an airplane, and starts smoking it in the bathroom, and people think he's a terrorist planning to attack.  The two friends get thrown to the ground with guns pointed at their heads and look at each other.

- The two guys meet a guy while visiting the south, and they nearly get shot when deer blood splashes on their face!

- In the beginning one of the friends was doing a naughty thing in bed, and his face gets... I can't say because it's gross!

- When they go to prison and have to eat meat sandwiches, lol.

- When they break out of prison and happen to see a boat waiting to take them back to America.

- Doogie Howser unicorns!

Most of the gratuitous scenes aren't really funny and are very awkward.  The funniest moments are the cleanest, although they really seem to want to beat you over the head with dispelling racial stereotypes while making fun of them.

3403927,4,B0017ANAX6,"First off, I have to say that, IMO, the first one was better.  It's usually true of sequels, so that shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone.  As for the movie?  Many of the jokes were crude and/or offensive to any number of religous/ethnic/political/ect. groups and/or peoples.  But, you know what, if you can't take a joke then that's too bad, so although the jokes might be offensive, I don't think anyone should take offense.  That being said, if you saw and liked the first movie, this is essentially more of the same.  Harold and Kumar are the same likable loosers they were in the first film... and they're still getting high.  Also, they're still getting lost.  It's still funny though.

I mean many of the stereotypes explored in this film are rather stupid. So laughing at them makes them even stupider which shows that racism is, indeed, stupid.

Having said that there is a poltical statement from jump street in this film. Harold and Kumar are sent to Gitmo because they're believed to be terrortist, despite their protests. If that's not saying something then I don't know what is. Their parents are treated awfully, which is again another statement.

In fact this movie could be considered a political comedy, but it's not. It's still got the weed, but to a less degree this time than in the first.

Everyone is cast really well in this. I was happy to see John Reep(as I think he's rather funny) and he was spot on playing a Southern redneck you'll actually like.(Which, even though he's a Southerner, isn't as easy as you may think.)

3403936,4,B0017ANAX6,"This movie was far better than I expected it to be.  The critics did not give it its just desserts largely because of its use of many of the same themes and gags from their first movie, i.e., a supposed lack of originality.  I disagree.  The sequel builds on and successfully uses what it created in the first movie.  It is essentially about how bad things constantly happen to two well-meaning but chemically challenged bunglers, who despite their many flaws, are the good guys in the movie.  It is underrated as a satire as it pokes fun at the sheer boneheadedness of those responsible for such moral and legal travesties as Gitmo, instead of simply portraying them as wrong.  It is ultimately meant to be funny, not a political lesson, however, and it usually achieves its goal, although it does rely more on the use of nudity and graphic ""shock and awe"" techniques than the previous movie.  I disagree with those characterizing it as advocating drug use.  No one could see how these two goofballs screw up their lives (such as getting sent to Gitmo because of Kumar's hi-tech bong) and rationally want to emulate them, anymore than watching a trainwreck would make one want to be in one.  It is satirical slapstick that is both funny and ultimately goodhearted as it drives home the inner goodness of its unlikely heroes after they find two strong women to help straighten-out the messes they have created of their lives!",1220918400,11,1425,4.713709677419355

Between the gratuitous sexual scenes which were neither erotic or sexy but rather a nightmare from a maladjusted twelve year old's mentality, to some Government official wiping his bum with the Bill of Rights [just plain gross and not at all funny]; this so called feature film rests at the very lowest of the bottom feeders from greedy film studios to make a quick buck off a substandard sequel to an originally creative effort.

I thought ""Harold & Kumar go to White Castle"" was a well written contemporary ""young"" comedy which actually displayed some wit at times as well as good comedic acting [loved the racoon attack in the car].

The first one was kind of under the radar until it did well in rentals and made its way onto cable.  This one was obviously given a bigger budget, and they not only kept all the raunch of the first movie, but expanded upon it.  Neil Patrick Harris was a scream in the first movie as it was totally unexpected to see him act like a drug-taking, alcohol swilling, sex fiend.  He shows up in this movie as well, but the shock of seeing Doogie Howser in such a manner has kind of worn off.  The movie is still funny, albeit stupid.  The jokes are rather easy to see coming, but that doesn't matter.  If you like Rated R comedies like they used to make in the early 80's, you'll enjoy this movie.

Unfortunately, we are disappointed.  The director of White Castle, Danny Leiner, isn't the director of this project.  Instead the writers from the first installment, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, also tackle the directing.  Within the first five minutes of the movie, it is obvious the new directors aren't as good as the first. Between watching Kumar reach a very productive climax to seeing Neil Patrick Harris gruesomely gunned down, I have to recommend not watching the Unrated Version.  What made White Castle such a good movie was the comedic timing of Kal Penn and John Cho; their facial expressions to the ridiculous lines or situations they encountered were priceless.

I've had some of my favorite shows and movies be dumb and dull first time round but I just can't convince myself to watch this movie again anytime soon.

3403951,1,B0017ANAX6,"A four year hiatus from the almost-cult classic status of H and K Go to White Castle was not long enough to pull off this sophmoric film.

In a desperate attempt to appeal to young males as its target audience, it features grossness-- such as explosive diaherra, killing Bambi, inbreeding, and gratutious, bottomless (as opposed to topless) parties-- in place of humor. White Castle made us laugh as it took us on the road to nerdiness,kindness,impossible situations and improbable coolness. In this film, all of that is replaced by prison rape, dopers and a sadistic Dougy Hooser. Where did they ever get the idea that misogyny was funny?

It was not successful at the box office. It won't be any funnier in your living room. Don't waste your money on this one.",1218672000,6,762,4.765151515151516

Afterwards I watched another movie which brought Harold and Kumar all into perspective. There is significant contrast when you experience cinematic art vs shtick. I was entertained but at a low level.",1218672000,,732,4.470149253731344

3403955,4,B0017ANAX6,"Okay, I heard that this movie was really not funny or it wasn't as good as the original. After just seeing it all I can say is: WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS!

What a pleasant surprise! This film continues the further adventures of two racially stereotyped college students days shortly after their adventures from the first film. However due to Kal Penn's Kumar who just can't live without weed for one second, even though he and best pal John Cho's Harold are headed to Amsterdam where weed is legal in the first place, are caught with a bong on the plane that quickly gets mistaken for a bomb. Enter a racially moronic Federal officer (very funny) played by Rob Corddry, and the two get sent to the famous Guantanamo Bay....

..and by the title of the film alone you'd figure it was all about dealing with life in that prison, dont'cha? Wrong again. That title is misleading because this is another H&K road trip movie, because they're outta the Bay within the movie's first fifteen minutes. The rest of the movie involves getting back to America, encountering tons of stereotypes of race in different ways, saving Kumar's ex from a jerk, and a ton of other very humorous people and things along the way. Don't let the title fool you, there's alot more to this movie than a remake of ""Let's Go To Prison"".

Now I wasn't that huge of a fan of the first movie other than thinking it was okay at best, but Bay beats it by leaps and bounds. I must have laughed twenty to thirty good times watching it. And with the disc I choose the Unrated version and for a comedy, this one really, really pushes the limit on that term. There's some scenes in it I can't believe would be allowed on any Family Superstore's shelf. And believe me, it ain't all pot jokes either, and in fact I felt that got downplayed for other funny subjects quite well here.

So look, this movie isn't the Animal House or Up In Smoke of this generation in overall quality but bottom line, it's very funny. I couldn't believe a sequel to a movie that didn't blow me away the first time could make me laugh like this one and I didn't roll my eyes in bad-joke despair not once here. It is NOT as bad as some have made it out to be and I feel it's about time we can all laugh at each others cultural differences in film again without truly being hurtful. Definitely worth a view/rent, and maybe a purchase when both films are maybe sold together. Glad to see Harold & Kumar back, see you two again in Part III.

Cheech and Chong didn't exactly make the critics write glowing reviews either so don't expect any now for Harold and Kumar. Their comedy doesn't appeal to most movie critics. This movie doesn't have the freshness of the two characters in the first movie, but it still delivers on some funny moments. Harold and Kumar while flying to Amsterdam are accused of being terrorists and are shipped off to Guantanamo Bay. Their escape and return home is a bit different type of road movie. I think you may see a bit of resurgence in this type humor because even Cheech and Chong are giving it another go. The humor is just a nice mix of adult humor, slapstick, and pothead jokes.

Harold and Kumar are refreshing comic protagonists for our times, especially as they defeat racial stereotypes of nerdy, no-fun Asians. The first film succeeded because of this fresh, new quality, while their quest for the perfect burger merged elements of crass commercialism, slavering bong-fixated hunger and actual wit...I actually became a little fixated on the first film, along with friends of mine. It has a cult feeling, is something that can be enjoyed again and again, is well-structured and very, very funny. Not so much ""Escape from Guantanimo Bay."" Everything that was funny and original about ""White Castle"" is retread and rehashed (pun intended) in this one. The only thing that could possibly kill the insoucient power of the franchise is to serve it up again, with diminishing returns. While ""White Castle"" is hardly ""Citizen Kane,"" it has surprising depth; in fact, I've conducted an ongoing structural analysis of ""White Castle"" in relation to Joseph Campbell's hero's journey paradigm, and it is truly a heroic quest narrative...I don't think we need another installment of Harold and Kumar, bottom line. The first was very clever and entertaining, the second plays it safe, which is no fun at all. Not to say there aren't moments in ""Escape from Gitmo""--the 'manmeat sandwich' scene, the initial scene on the plane to Amsterdam, when Kumar's bong is mistaken for a bomb...obvious and predictable stuff, but I laughed.

3403964,1,B0017ANAX6,"Utterly lacking the charm of the first movie, this one bypassed the clever and jumped straight to the crass. It's guilty of the worst sin of bad comedy: making us feel embarrassed or disgusted rather than giving us something funny. I guess the idea is that nervous laughter is as good as real laughter. But to me, that ain't comedy. For example: Kumar masturbating in his bed and ejaculating on himself; or Harold & Kumar being forced to fellate a prison guard. I suppose either situation might have been made funny, but they weren't. We were merely expected to laugh at the outrageousness of seeing these things in a movie. Genius.

Not to say the movie didn't have some genuinely funny stuff in it, but mostly it was just tedious. So unless you think films like American Pie III are the pinnacle of comedy, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1217721600,7,847,4.572368421052632
3403965,4,B0017ANAX6,"Harold & Kumar are the Y2K+ equivalent of the 1970's stoner's Cheech & Chong.  Harold & Kumar are more obviously intelligent than their predecessors, and Kumar has a bad attitude and smart mouth that gets he and his friend into much more trouble than C&C could ever seem to find, but the parallels are there to easily be drawn.

Escape from Guantanamo Bay, (H&K2 for all intents and purposes), picks up where the first movie (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle or H&K1) stopped, almost literally.  As the film starts 'rold-y is in the shower cleaning up and preparing to take a flight to Amsterdam to go chase down the gal of his dreams.  As that goes on, well, let's just say that Kumar isn't shy about using the facilities at the same time.

Before going further, understand what you are getting if you pick up this film -- it's not meant to be high society artistic genius, it's lowest common denominator humor and it hit's that target fairly well.

The humor is stereotypical and telegraphed from miles away, but is still funny if you aren't too uptight to appreciate and/or acknowledge it.  There are visual gags (sayings on T-shirts and such), verbal gags and more, misunderstandings that lead to problems, and then there are more misunderstandings on the part of the clueless government employees involved in dealing with the initial misunderstandings.  There are plenty of drug references and portrayals of drug usage, and plenty of gratituitous nudity thrown in as well -- both male and female.

Watch it if you can lower yourself to the right level.  Otherwise skip it and consider yourself too intelligent for something so low brow.",1217635200,4,1644,4.797872340425532
3403966,1,B0017ANAX6,"I must admit I've never seen `Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle'.  Because of it's cult classic status, I have some real regrets.  Except as I go into `Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanomo Bay,' I can at least evaluate this movie without being biased by the former film.

I found this sequel to be repulsive, so I'll try to be as brief as possible.  I first want to say that I've seen, reviewed, and/or recommended `Superbad,' '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Guantanamo/dp/B000HOL67U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Guantanamo</a>,' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prisoner-or-How-I-Planned-to-Kill-Tony-Blair/dp/B000OU3WYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair</a>'.  I've also highly recommended `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart/dp/B000VBB6F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart</a>,' `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-Tapes/dp/B000O76ZOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War Tapes</a>,' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Homecoming-Writing-the-Wartime-Experience/dp/B000WOSB0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Homecoming - Writing the Wartime Experience</a>,' so it doesn't matter what political spectrum the movie plays.  If it's a good movie, it's a good movie.

Plot:  Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) go to Amsterdam while lusting for two beauties:  Vanessa (Danneel Harris), a college sweetheart with whom Kal split two years earlier, and Maria (Paula Garc&eacute;s), Harold's model interest.  On the plane, Kumar, who can't wait to get to where the grass is green and flowing, lights a ""smokeless"" bong to share with Harold in the airplane bathroom.  When caught, ""racial profiling"" makes the people on the flight panic, thinking the bong is a bomb.  Diverted back to the U.S., both face imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay.  From there they escape and episodically travel from Miami to Texas hoping to stop Vanessa from making her vows to pure-bred overbearing bore, Colton (Eric Winter).

Execution:  As original as `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat-Cultural-Learnings-of-America-for-Make-Benefit-Glorious-Nation-of-Kazakhstan-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000MMMT9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (Full Screen Edition)</a>' was, `...Escape from Guantanamo Bay' is a slap-in-the-face imitation, a stoner road movie without all the impromptu filming of real people.

A conservative objection:  This is all blather, tongue-in-cheek anger dressed up as comedy.

A liberal objection:  ""Imagine"" a 1:40 comedy with Archie Bunker (Home Security Agent Fox [Rob Corddry]) yelling most of the time with very few funny jokes.  This is deadly for our issues.  Al Franken didn't become a #1 best-selling author for nothing!

A humorist objection:  If 80% of your material is angry sarcasm, can it still be funny?

Example:  Agent Fox uses the Fifth Amendment as toilet paper.  Wha Ha Ha!  (Yes, this movie's a satire.)

Redeeming Traits:  There's a funny scene where a woman on the airplane distorts seeing Kumar as an Arab jihadist.  There's another funny scene after they condemn the Ku Klux Klan as ""racist dogs,"" we see a Spuds MacKenzie look-alike in a white hood.  The themes are laudable.  ""Racial profiling"" is not acceptable.  There are tender moments, but while they're more sincere than `Shallow Hal,' they're also about as exceptional.

Trying to be consistent, I must say the timing of `Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay' is measurably better than `Meet the Spartans,' but at least that parody rendered a few more laughs.

3403967,4,B0017ANAX6,"There's no question Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is arguably one of the dumbest comedies you will ever see. Little of it makes sense and none of it is actually possible. Well, I can't say none of it, but most of it is highly unlikely. And yet, the movie has some of the funniest (and most disturbing) scenes you'll ever see on screen. There's what has to be the film world's first bottomless party. There's a 3-way between Kumar, his ex-girlfriend and a large bag of weed (which, like most of the movie, starts of funny, gets funnier, then turns exceedingly disturbing). And there's President Bush toking up with our two anti-heroes. And in between there's all sorts of humor, much of it drug or race related.

Rob Corddry plays an FBI agent hunting down Harold and Kumar, and he may be the most racist person you'll ever see in a movie. Everyone who isn't white (and Catholic) is a suspect, and the manner in which he goes about trying to get information is painfully racist and funny. Whether it's grape soda and a black witness, or nickels to a Jewish pair of friends (who you'll recognize from the original film), he'll do whatever it takes to get Harold and Kumar and send them back to prison.

Yes, the movie title involves them escaping from the notorious prison in Cuba, but that portion of the film lasts all of five minutes. And even though the movie starts 5 minutes after the first one ends, the movie isn't really about them going to Amsterdam to find Harold's love. The movie really turns into a cross country trip to Texas to try and clear their names. From Cuba to Miami, through Alabama and Louisiana, the potheads we love to love have to get through all manner of obstacles to try and get to a former classmates wedding, so he can use his connections to save them. Along the way Kumar sees an ex-girlfriend, who coincidentally is getting married to their classmate. He realizes on the spot he's still in love with her, so getting to the wedding now has more purpose. Oh, and of course, Neil Patrick Harris is still driving aimlessly around the country and runs into the guys again. This leads to a scene at a whorehouse, and a shocking conclusion. By the way, don't leave the theater too quickly when the movie ends. Stay for the credits so you don't miss the very end of the film.

I laughed throughout most of the film, groaned in a couple of places, and had to say 'Oh God!' a couple of times as well. The people in the theater were a strange mix because while most loved it, there were a few who just sat there stonefaced. Why would anyone go to this movie and sit there with a blank look on their face? What did they expect? An Oscar-worthy film? This movie is rude and crude, disgusting and hilarious.

I appreciate the fact most characters return for a second romp and add more flare and hilarity.  N.P.H. is hilarious, more crude than before but it works.  Harold and Kumar's relationships seems familiar and yet they progressed as characters acknowledging each others faults.  And saying sorry.  There are several memorable moments that are to taboo to explain here but if you saw the first you know what you're in for.  Did it live up to the hype? Yes.  Did it add more to the series? Yes.

3403977,4,B0017ANAX6,"Keeping mostly in tone with Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is a solid sequel that delivers the laughs and gross out gags that one would come to expect.  The sequel picks up where the original left off with Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) on their way to Amsterdam, until the two get mistaken for terrorists and are locked away in Guantanamo Bay.  After escaping, the duo find themselves as fugitives on the run from a racist and dim-witted government agent (The Daily Show's Rob Cordry), and go on a cross-country journey to Texas for the hope of getting help from the politically-laced fiance' (Eric Winter) of Kumar's ex-girlfriend (gorgeous Danneel Harris) whom he is still in love with.  On the way though, there's all kinds of chaos, including running into the KKK (led by Christopher Meloni no less, minus the Freakshow makeup), mutant children, and Neil Patrick Harris (returning as himself).  While Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay isn't quite as enjoyable as the first film, it still delivers the goods that fans of the first film are looking for, and while it does become pretty predictable compared to the original as it winds down, it still packs enough laughs to keep you interested.  All in all, if you got any enjoyment at all out of Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, you'll more than likely dig what you find here.",1217289600,6,1393,4.692622950819672
3403978,3,B0017ANAX6,"Two bright guys with promising futures submit to immaturity to keep them in a perpetual state of arrested development.  Sound familiar?  At least a few dozen other slacker-stoner comedies have created variations on the simple formula, but perhaps none had the sleeper status of Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.  Naturally when one is riding high (no pun intended) from such unanticipated home video success, the only logical thing to do is spurn out a sequel; thus was born the slightly superfluous Harold & Kumar 2: Escape From Guantanamo Bay.

Picking up mere moments after the first one left off, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) scramble to make a flight, following their neighbor Maria (Paula Garc&eacute;s) to Amsterdam.  After causing a bit of a stink at the airport, the guys get suspected of being terrorists on the plane when an overly concerned passenger hears them say ""bomb"" instead of ""bong.""  Things only take a turn for the even more absurd (if that's possible!) from there when they escape from Guantanamo Bay, encounter a tripped-out N.P.H., and detour to try to break up a wedding.  Laughs are shared, but much of the film, including a moment with a foreign hick and his too-attractive-to-be-attracted-to-him wife, feel ripped straight out of the original, begging the question of why another version was necessary.

The answer to that may come in the way of supporting characters Vanessa and Colton (Danneel Harris and Eric Winter, respectively), though, whose characters have histories with both boys and who take center focus (even if not a lot of screen-time).  While Kumar struggles to win Vanessa back, Harold just wants Colton's important political ties to help get exonerated.  Harold & Kumar 2: Escape From Guantanamo Bay, therefore, very quickly transitions from a road trip comedy (as the title suggests) to one of a very different variety: a romantic comedy.  The problem is that none of the male/female pairings have the strong chemistry audiences have come to expect from a Harold & Kumar movie when compared to the incredible buddy relationship of the title's lead stars.  Winter is supposed to be a villain, which is blatantly obvious when he gives his fianc&eacute; a lecture of her found joint, but his slick suits, perfect bone structure, and wide smile make it hard to even dislike the guy, especially considering his character has his act together.  Oddly, viewers may find themselves looking at Harold and Kumar in a new light with this film: they are not carefree kids who can afford to mess around, but rather they are adults with responsibilities, and when they don't act accordingly, it's hard to find them sympathetic.

Co-writers-turned-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg certainly banked on the original film's largest draw: N.P.H.--I'm sorry, it just feels wrong to call him by his full name now--resurrecting a slightly self-deprecating version of himself to plant butts in seats this second-chance time around.  In Harold & Kumar 2, it feels like all of their energy went towards giving him something new and outlandish to do, while the rest of the film relied on fart jokes and clouds of smoke.  At times you may even find yourself just waiting for his arrival on-screen and breathing a hefty sigh of relief once he finally is.  Unfortunately, his mere moments come to an end far too quickly, and then you are left with almost an hour of bleakosity to get through to the end.

Harold & Kumar 2: Escape from Guantanamo Bay offers a wide variety of extras, probably assuming once again it's greatest audience will be the home viewer.  And they will certainly not be disappointed with the selection!  ""Dude, Change The Movie!"" is the most fascinating, as an interactive features that allows the home viewer to select from alternative scenes to change the sequence of events within the feature.  Reminiscent of one of those ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" childhood books, this feature is simple enough that even the most baked viewers (and let's face it, it appears the directors assumed most would be) can take part.  There are also two optional commentaries, with words from both directors, the inspiration behind John Cho's character, and George W. Bush impersonator James Adomian, who also appears in his own special feature: Bush PSA.  ""The World of Harold & Kumar"" is a fun-filled behind-the-scenes featurette, and there are an astounding twenty-seven! deleted scenes from which to choose.",1217203200,3,4458,5.035374149659864
3403979,5,B0017ANAX6,"I don't have a lot to add to what other reviewers have said, except that:

* I saw ""Harold and Kumar Escape"" in the theatre and laughed out loud almost all the way through the movie.

* I then bought the DVD of the original movie, which I had not seen. I thought that the original movie was good, but that ""Escape"" was twice as funny.

* Anyone who's lived through the heartbreak and shame of the Cheney-Bush years will welcome a chance to laugh at the insanity they've inflicted on us. I especially enjoyed watching one of the other government officials beat up the ""Homeland Security"" Nazi while screaming, ""It's people like you who have convinced the world that we're a bunch of idiots!""

* I look forward to receiving the ""Escape"" DVD set, which I've pre-ordered.",1213401600,11,767,4.536231884057971
3403980,4,B0017ANAX6,"I had high hopes for this one, but was prepared to be let down considering the absolutely awful sequels that I have seen from great movies (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, American Pie 2 and Dumb and Dumberer) which was a prequel, I know, but you get the idea. They have a tendency to try and capture the magic of the first one, but end up making a parody of it instead by recycling the jokes and hoping for the best. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! It captured the same, utter ridiculousness from the first movie, but made a completely fresh and funny two hours. The beginning was a bit slow, but once it got going, I laughed until the end. If you liked the first one, I think you'll love this one too. NOTE TO THE WRITERS: If you cant resist the urge or the money to make ""Harold and Kumar Get Married"" that's great, I would love to see one more Harold and Kumar movie, but please, take your time and do it right and don't pull an X-Men 3 or Spiderman 3 on me and waste everyone's time.",1213228800,,1014,4.178571428571429
3403981,3,B0017ANAX6,Although I love the Harold and Kumar movies I was rather disappointed in this one. I wqs expecting it to be as funny if not better than the first one and it surely wasn't. It was silly and not that funny.,1212451200,,204,4.0
3403982,5,B0017ANAX6,"Wow. Many of you totally missed the point of the movie. The George W. Bush thing was saying that he is just a regular guy and isn't all evil, but just has a lot of daddy problems (i.e. 'Finishing off' what George Bush Sr. started with the war that we are in right now).

The shots at the DHS are about how they are stripping away our rights and label whoever they can 'terrorists' just so they could seem like heroes, when in reality many innocent people are being harmed in the process.

Guantanamo Bay...well, that was more or less a joke about how we torture all of those people there (don't tell me that we don't, because you know what is going on there but choose to ignore it). I guess it could seem in bad taste, because it was one of those toilet humor jokes, but it was implying that sucking Big Bob's dick was worse than being waterboarded.

The white person thing, well a lot of America is mostly white, and everyone takes things for granted. Many live in rich neighborhoods and have high-paying jobs while there are Black people with the same qualifications but are discriminated against because there is still racism in this world. Also, if you actually watched the movie, not all white people in it were stupid. Do you recall the helicopter scene when that one DHS agent knocked over Ron Fox, aimed a gun at him, then yelled about how everyone knows that Harold and Kumar are innocent but were just idiots, and that he was too stupid to realize that? I wouldn't call that stupid.

Any questions?",1211587200,6,1509,4.456521739130435
3403983,4,B0017ANAX6,"HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE...is a very funny movie, and I laughed a great deal.  That's a good thing.

It's also sloppy, careless and goes for too many obvious or clichd jokes.  That's a shame.

It's too bad, because what we have in these two guys is a wonderful blend of what's best and worst about young Americans.  They are smart.  They are multi-ethnic.  In general, they are good-hearted and appreciate the chance to live in America.  They're also lazy, self-indulgent and far too easily distracted by drugs.  This makes their movies ripe for social commentary.

Too often, though, they take the easy way out with cheap jokes and predictable visual puns.

The movie shows us these two goofballs (and if you haven't seen #1...you must see it first...#2 literally picks up the morning after WHITE CASTLE), setting out on a trip to Holland, so that Harold can follow a girl he's hot for and Kumar can enjoy the legal drugs.  But when Kumar brings a hi-tech bong on the plane, it's mistaken for a bomb and the two are mistaken for terrorists.  This bit is probably the funniest stuff in the film.  It's weirdly credible that passengers might take these two unruly and ""un-white"" Americans for terrorists...not just because they don't ""look like us"" but because they sneak into restroom together and then appear with a dangerous looking device.  Much is also made of the world ""bong"" sounding a lot like ""bomb.""  As in, ""I've got a bong!  No, no...I said bong!!""

My wife and I were pretty much laughing our rear ends off at this point.  Then Harold and Kumar are incarcerated in Guantanamo, and the movie quickly reaches it's low-point.  The American guards are all rapists and idiots.  So, at this point, we were wondering if we could continue to sit through these cheap and unfair jokes about the young men and women in our military.  Have many of them done disgusting and illegal things?  Yes.  Have MOST of them?  Absolutely not...yet scenes like these propagate the idea that our soldiers are a bunch of oral sex crazed, torturing thugs.

Fortunately, the two boys escape quite soon, and we're able to follow their adventures as they try for vindication.  I won't spoil any more of the plot...but suffice it to say that from this point on, the jokes become wildly uneven.  Some scenes are quite funny (there's a scene with a deer that had me in stitches) and others are FLAAAATTT!  A scene at a wealthy friend's house in Florida springs to mind.

Neil Patrick Harris reprises his role as himself...and he's nearly as funny and surprising as last time...although far cruder.  It was almost too much of a good thing.

The movie takes some clever shots at the current political climate...but mostly it follows the same crude path as its predecessor.

The two young leads are quite enjoyable and easy to warm up to.  Kal Penn, in particular, has some promise (see THE NAMESAKE)...I hope he can shake off this role.  Otherwise, the movie is low-budget and stylistically simple.

As a 44 year old man, I fully recognize that I'm not the target for this film.  Yet I enjoyed it enough to laugh a great deal, and to say now that I would recommend it...but only if you've seen and enjoyed #1.  If you hated #1...you won't like ESCAPE any better.  This movie plays right to its core audience...for better or worse.",1210291200,14,3307,4.685217391304348
3403984,3,B0017ANAX6,"Harold and Kumar are back and this time they get accused of being terrorists because Kumar sneaked a weird looking bong on a plane. They get sent to Guantanamo Bay but they are barely even there. It's not a prison comedy, it's a road trip comedy just like the original. But it has less charm than the original. It trys to get laughs with many prejudice jokes. While it has so much nudity with male and female lower parts shown that it should've been NC-17.

  While on the run from the Feds Kumar plans to break up the wedding of an ex-girlfriend but Harold is against that since the groom has political power and can help clear their names. The movie is over-stuffed and over-stays it's welcome but it still made me laugh even if the original was funnier and has more of a head on it's shoulder. Neil Patrick Harris makes a funny appearance as...Neil Patrick Harris again though and he provides some of the funnier moments of the movie. While a Bush impersonator as Bush gets some laughs just due to his lines and not because he looks anything like Bush. While the movie made me laugh, I recommend Forgetting Sarah Marshall over it.",1209600000,3,1133,4.490291262135922
