2253937,1,B0007Z2556,"If there's one trend in horror movies that really needs to go away it's the Loud Sudden Noise, aka the ""SHREEENK!""

I mean that overamplified, more-annoying-than-scary racket that jumps from the speakers during a thriller whenever anything mildly startling happens. It usually sounds like a cello being sliced in two by a guillotine and it's a sure sign that a movie doesn't have any honest scares.

You know the drill:

The hero cautiously backs into a dark room and bumps into - SHREEENK! - a coat rack.

The heroine closes a medicine cabinet and in the mirror - SHREEENK! - sees the ghost of her great-aunt.

Few recent horror flicks have relied as heavily on the ""SHREEENK!"" as ""Boogeyman,"" which is often atmospheric but mostly silly and boring.

Following a childhood run-in with the title character, magazine editor Tim (Barry Watson) is left with a crippling fear of closets and other dark storage spaces. He's a mess. At 23, he still stops in for treatment at the kid's ward of his neighborhood psychiatric hospital.

""Look around you,"" his doctor finally tells him. ""There are only children here.""

I fear that scene isn't nearly as moving as the writers intended, but it sets the tone because Tim spends most of the movie walking around his dark old house wigging out - in fact, a good 60 percent of the film's running time is devoted to scenes in which he approaches sinister-looking doors/staircases/barns really... really... really... slowly (just before the ""SHREEENK!"").

The rest of the movie involves Tim doubting his sanity and awkwardly courting his childhood sweetheart (Emily Deschanel, who isn't given much to do but still manages to be the best thing in the movie). Eventually, they battle the fabled Boogie Man, and I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure their conflict ends as the result of a complete lack of ideas.

This is one ""Boogeyman"" that won't keep many viewers awake. That task falls to the ""SHREEENK!""",1107561600,113,1936,4.875
2253938,1,B0007Z2556,"Touted as being the ""scariest movie of the year"" is quite a thing to live up to.  Unfortunately, this does not even come close.  It's a mixed bag of snippits from ""They"", ""Darkness Falls"", ""Darkness"", with a little bit of ""The Mummy"" thrown in there for all those who can't get enough of video game-like CGI effects.  The sound effects are the only thing remotely frightening about this film.  It's a great idea that was not dealt with in the right way.  Stephen King did it brilliantly as did Wes Craven many years ago.  Too bad the makers of this film had no idea what to do with the Boogeyman once they channeled him.  They should have left him in the closet to stay. He was scarier there.",1107388800,11,692,4.359375
2253939,2,B0007Z2556,"I'll admit it: I haven't seen Boogeymen yet, but I really don't want to, just because of the fact that I have been seeing the previews for the movie so many times that I am going crazy. Frankly, Boogeymen deserves 1 and a half stars, not two. All Boogeymen is your typical horror movie which happens to involves that scary closet monster that we all used to be afraid of when were little. Of course, I was a little confused the first time I saw the preview for Boogeymen, because it starts of with creepy music and a cemetery scene. As the previews progressed, I had my theories for the movie's plot, but frankly, Boogeymen is the type of movie that you just have to guess about the plot until you buy your over-priced movie tickets and go off to the movie theater.

(...)

Also, isn't this movie just a tad bit clique? I mean, a boogeyman. Come on. I'm guessing that the boogeyman is that horrid closet monster that we were all terrified of when were little kids. Remember, people? And all you have to do is look at the movie poster, too. When I first saw previews for Boogeymen, I was like, ""Oh, this looks pretty intriguing."" But come on, folks. The TV network is making a fairly-good movie into crap, just because they're overdoing it. And the fairly-good plot? Pfft. Again, pure monster-movie clique.

So, you're probably wondering why I didn't just give this movie 1 star and say bye-bye. Well, you see, I will give Boogeymen this: it does look horrifying. Whether it's just another cheesy, pathetic movie or not, the previews were scary and I had trouble sleeping the night I saw the previews for it. So that's why I'm giving Boogeymen all this credit: it's director obviously knows how to give it's audience a good scare, whether or not his movie is overdone or not.",1106956800,,1774,4.520249221183801

2253954,5,B0007Z2556,"Boogeyman is a very cool horror film with lots of great scenes. It is made by the same people who made ''The Grudge'' and ''Army Of Darkness''.

The film is about a man named Tim. It starts off with Tim as a kid seeing his father get killed by the Boogeyman in his bedroom closet. It then cuts to Tim as an adult with his girlfriend Jessica. Tim is now terrified of closets because of what he saw when he was young. During the course of the movie, Tim has scary visions, including one of his mother. Tim later meets up with his childhood friend Kate, and he also meets a mysterious young girl named Franny. Throughout the film, the viewer is trying to find out whether Tim is delusional, or whether he is really being haunted by the Boogeyman. All of the viewers questions get answered near the end.

The movie is well acted, well written, and well directed. Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, and Skye McCole Bartusiak play their characters very well. The movie is filmed in a very unique way, and the Boogeyman looks really cool. This is a good horror film and I totally recommend it.",1396137600,2,1082,4.432160804020101

such a big let down.
when i was a kid, the REAL boogeyman was always hidden in the shadows and all i ever saw was a pair of red glowing eyes in the dark.
and whenever i would actually see the boogeyman all i would ever see of him was hidden under a sheet.

Barry Watson (Tim, the main character) gave it his best, and only his charm kept me stubbornly trying 'til the end to find some reason behind the making of this boring, plodding, slow, disappointing mess of a movie.  After waiting over an hour to see some kind of monster or scary manifestation of SOMETHING, in the very last few scenes there was a lame rendition of a monster/skeleton.  There simply wasn't a clear plot, no rhyme or reason why we should be afraid and a total let-down from the ending.  There is NO REASON to watch this movie.  There are just too many other scary movie that do their job a heck of a lot better than this thing.  I strongly advise you to skip it.",1382227200,,841,4.387096774193548
2253958,1,B0007Z2556,"Alfred Hitchcock would turn over in his grave if he were to see this film. It is built on the foundation of suspense but does not know how to execute it, and there is so many unexplained events on top of all that. Camera shot after dreary camera shot of our leading man posing as if trying to hear something that he may possibly only hear with very little payoffs than a shadow in the dark. It may be scary in real life, but the effect does not translate well on film as three fourths of the way we are left dangling for something really juicy to happen, and the climatic finale fight to send it where it came from is a little more than a quick wrap up with a sorry ending with yet another shot of the man peering out as befuddled as he was since the beginning.",1378339200,2,761,4.08

2253961,1,B0007Z2556,"I'm a little ticked off right now- this movie is flat out *awful*.  83 minutes of complete boredom.  I want my time back!

The movie relies on several cheap jump scares, but these segments are executed in the most unimaginative way ever.  The music and sound effects just suddenly turn LOUD without there actually being anything scary occurring on screen.  It's an incredibly easy trick to try and scare viewers by having them first experience several seconds of complete silence, then a loud noise to trigger a frightened reaction.  A terrible trick to try and make a movie scary if there ever was one.  Didn't fool me, thankfully.

I can only recall two scenes that truly frightened me. One is when the main character of Barry Watson stumbles into a room where a little girl is sleeping and she's so frantic Barry can't calm her down.  Meanwhile the girl is looking at the ceiling the whole time she's freaking out.  Barry turns around and sees someone has been in the room as evident by the one out of place ceiling tile.

The other quality segment is near the end when FINALLY the boogeyman makes his first appearance, and a man with a nail gun appears and shoots at what Barry initially thinks is him, but then Barry turns around and sees the boogeyman charging out of the darkness behind him, which is who the nail gun shooter is aiming for.  A rare moment of actual suspense.

Barry Watson is a pretty good actor, but he was given a terrible script to work with.  The entire pacing and storyline feels similar to watching an episode of Ghost Whisperer or Beverly Hills 90210.  You know, not *real* suspense- more like suspense intended for the easily frightened types.  That's what this movie is.  It's horrendous.

Also, the appeal of the boogeyman is supposed to be centered around children being afraid to fall asleep for fear the boogeyman's hiding in the closet but... this movie abandons that all-important aspect and instead focuses on Barry Watson's character walking around through dark homes and playgrounds meeting a little girl on two occasions, and a girl he likes (Emily Deschanel's character, who's also out of place- stick with Bones, Emily).

2253966,3,B0007Z2556,"So a young man named named Tim (Barry Watson, ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"" & TV's 7th Heaven"") is trying to come to grips with some bad stuff he saw as a kid. He has decided to return to his old home and see if he simply imagined what happened or if its real. What is this ""it""? Why its the Boogeyman, you know the stories about checking your closet every night to make sure he doesn't get you after you go to bed. Tim is sure he's real, even if he may not want to admit it right away, though those around him question whether he's making it all up.

There's not a ton of material here, its a pretty simple story with a few good jolts, especially once it gets going in the second half. Included in the cast is Emily Deschanel (TV's Bones) & Lucy Lawless (TV's Xena), which do lend a little decent acting to this flick. I've certainly seen worse horror films, this is a good take on the old tale of ""The Boogeyman"", I did like the whole closet theme used to explain the creatures movement.

2253968,2,B0007Z2556,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

I hardly ever go to the movies anymore because today's movies can't compare to the movies of previous decades, and horror movies are the biggest letdown nowadays.  I'm turned off by 98% of the horror movie remakes and most of the non-remakes.  I remember seeing Boogeyman in the theater when it came out in 2005.  I was not impressed.  I was underwhelmed and rolling my eyes.  When the movie was over and the credits started rolling, people just quietly got up and exited the theater.  This is a typical horror movie of today - there are a lot of jump-out-of-your-seat moments where suddenly something comes out of nowhere and catches you off guard, causing you to jump out of your seat.  How typical nowadays.  Also, it's loaded with CGI.

The best era for horror movies was the 1970s and 1980s.  The 1920s, 1930s, '40s, '50s, and '60s were great as well, with the Universal, Hammer, and Amicus movies.  When it comes to Boogeyman, I can only recommend a rental.",1326326400,,1071,4.603174603174603
2253969,2,B0007Z2556,I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.,1324944000,,188,3.395348837209302
2253970,4,B0007Z2556,"I picked this up on a lark at a store without reading any reviews, based solely on Sam Raimi's role as producer (I'm a big fan of anything he's touched).  Glad I watched it before reading any reviews.

In short, I thought this film was a very effective, atmospheric handling of some primal fears that we all have.  Fear of the dark, fear of being alone, fear of creepy old houses, the fear that the worst terrors of our mind will manifest themselves simply because we imagined them, etc.

There are many horror movies that take their time to get to the point.  This one gets to the point immediately.  In fact, the first five minutes contain arguably the scariest material in the entire film, and could stand alone as an perfectly acceptable horror ""short.""  But there are other scenes with the same intensity, and the atmospheric horror and dread is pretty unrelenting throughout.  This film gripped me from the start, then never let up.

I've never watched Seventh Heaven, but was very impressed with the young man who plays the lead in this movie.  He has an undeniable likeability and charisma.  He was able to simultaneously play an earnest everyman and a tortured soul on the verge of psychosis.  In a role that required some acting chops, he was compelling, believable, and largely responsible for the success of the movie's realism in the face of bizarre and horrifically surreal circumstances.

On the negative side, the film resorts to some pretty cheesy CGI for the climax, ala something you'd see in a Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil.  It's too bad, because it could have been so much more effective with some old school effects.  As it is, though, the final sequence doesn't live up to the promise of what came earlier.

Even so, I enjoyed the movie, and will definitely watch it again.  Nice job.",1321228800,,1815,4.693037974683544
2253971,1,B0007Z2556,"This is in my opinion the worst example of a mainstream horror movie in the last ten years. There is almost no point to anything shown in this film. Much of this movie consists of just a bunch of random scenes of the main character opening closet doors while overusing cheap scare tactics such as loud shrieking sounds. When we finally get a chance to see this Boogeyman it is terribly done with a really bad cgi boogeyman. It comes off as corny and not in the least way scary. Forget the fact that there's no plot, there's barely any real scenario at all. The only thing close to a positive thing about this film is the fact that it does create a sense of atmosphere and also maybe that the film isn't really that long at only about 88 minutes. Overall a terrible film that is filled with bad horror cliches and little entertainment value. This film did however make enough money that two sequels were made. They however went straight to video.",1289174400,3,945,4.436781609195402
2253972,2,B0007Z2556,"Boogeyman has aspirations of being a psychological J-horror-style film: It all starts with a dad (Charles Messure) telling his son Tim (Aaron Murphy) that the monster in the closet isn't real - until, of course, it sucks him into the closet.  Flash forward to present day, where Tim (Barry Watson) is trying to fit in with the family of his rich girlfriend Jess (Tory Mussett). Things take a turn for the worse when Tim's background arises at the dinner table and soon after Tim gets a call about the death of his mother (Lucy Lawless) - the tragic event that will soon bring Tim back to face his worst fears.

All this time, Tim's been told that his father left him and that he created a fantasy - the boogeyman ate him - to explain it.  But that fiction comes to an end when Tim returns to his old home for the funeral, where everything in his room is exactly how he left it that night.  There's the ugly lamp, the looming coat, the bizarre raven toy, the monster toy, and the electric crystal ball. They manifest in different ways throughout the film, which is clever.

What isn't clever is the rest of the plot.  The audience might think the boogeyman is a figment of Tim's demented imagination up to a point, until said boogeyman starts suffocating people with plastic wrap and killing their girlfriends.  Then it's just a bog-standard slasher flick that echoes scarier movies that have gone before.  There's an inspired moment of dimensional hopping between scenes via closets, but it's lost in all the jump cuts and screaming.

When Tim finally does overcome his fears and discovers the truth about the boogeyman, it's too little, too late. The ghost-twist thing was done to death (ahem) in The Sixth Sense.

For example, in the beginning of the show, the kid's father is hurled up and down the parameters of the closet space with such force and animation similar to the old cartoons.  It is more comical than terrifying.  And the ghoul, whose motives are left unstated, seems merely to be a mischievious character reminiscent of bugs bunny or daffy duck, or, better yet, woody the wood pecker of Mel Blanc lore.  Except, instead of the humor resuting from that head banging lunacy of Melanerpes formicivorus, we have the same mischief combined with unadulterated malcontent.  The acting seems to involve lots of young people with pensive faces trying to imitate how young people talk and act.  The theater does have as its goal the imitation of real life, but not verbatim.  Improvization and poetic liberty seem to be a foreign concept to many of these young actors.  The plot?  There wasn't any.  No punch line.  The producers apparently thought that putting a kid in a haunted house of his youth, embellishing the spook with special effects, and adding a minor subplot of his social life would make for great movie making.  It fails miserably.  Why this immaterial being is able to bring about physical effects, and why, in the end, he is finally subject to being hit over the head with a common table lamp, begs the question.",1248393600,6,1460,4.764940239043825

  Alas, I was to be disappointed with _Boogeyman_.

 It wasn't awful, don't get me wrong, at no point did I want to stop watching it, I just feel disappointed.

 Ok, the basic premise. It opened pretty strongly, a young boy, the main character as a child, is having a hard time falling asleep one night. He sees in the half-light of his room everything as being sinister...the clothes crumpled together in chair, an action figure on his nightstand, they are all monsters, revealed as mundane objects when the boy switches the light on, but then something else becomes a monster. Soon enough though a real monster makes its presence known. The commotion that that causes soon summons the boy's father to the room, who with amusement and love confidently sets about to debunk his youngster's fears. Unfortunately there really is an (unglimpsed) monster in the room, one that sucks his father through the closet, never to be seen again.

 We fast forward to the future, where the main character, Tim, played by Barry Watson, is an editor (for a magazine?). He apparently had a rough child hood and is still seeing a psychologist for his fears (the same one it turns out since he was a little boy). He is afraid of dark places and closets, and I liked how when we go to his apartment it is all white, light, no dark paneling, no dark corners, all the doors from all the cabinets have been removed. He has a very attractive and apparently quite understanding girlfriend and seems to have a good life, far, far from home.

 Unfortunately events call him back to home with the funeral of his mother. The house he grew up in, the one his father vanished in, is his. He (foolishly!) decides to spend the night in it, visited a few times by his childhood friend Kate (played by Emily Deschanel, who was interesting to see playing a character so obviously unlike Bones in the TV show _Bones_).

 That's about as good as it gets. Interesting premise, good cast, some good mood and atmosphere...but that's it. They went to the well one too many times with the whole being scared of something that turns out to be just a coat hanger or door or what not, its silhouette in the dark taking on a threatening appearance. However, that to me wasn't really one of the Big Problems with the movie.

 First of all, some spoilers ahead, it becomes clear that you can only be hurt by the monster if you believe in him. No, wait, correct that. He won't hurt you, just your friends and family. What? They don't believe in him, they might not have even heard of him or know much about your belief (or be completely uninformed) but they can be hurt while you can't be more than just scared silly once in a while? And at what point does the monster come after someone? Why these people in his life at this time? Was it because the monster, this boogeyman, was fresh in his mind, or that he was close to or in that house? Why not before?

 Second, the monster can travel through closets from place to place. That's cool, that's fine, its been done but is not a bad plot device for a creature of this kind. Not a problem. Well, it seems when following the monster or its victims, Tim travels through space as well, going in a closet in one part of the world and ending up somewhere else. How is this possible? That is never explained. Would have been neat to show maybe some extradimensonal space that he entered perhaps, or that Tim had acquired powers by his connection with the creature, something, but it is never explained.

 Third, there is a whole subplot with the ghosts of children that were victims that I won't get into, but it didn't make much sense and I don't think ever got any adequate payoff or closure. I will say if those kids were victims of the monster, than why didn't Tim as a child join them? It was his father that the monster took, not him.

 Fourth, the final fate of some of the victims was unclear, I won't go into that either, too much spoiler age, but it is never made clear at all where they went and what happened to them.

 Finally, fifth, the monster, when finally shown at the end, was rendered with absolutely awful CGI. Just terrible.

 I would say skip this one. If want to be some sort of completist maybe, or if you really like Emily Deschanel, but otherwise I say give this a pass.",1237075200,4,4728,4.4825174825174825

It had alot of parts during the movie where it would make me jump from the closet slaming n all. I really liked the actual Boogeyman at the end of the movie. The special effects were not the best, but i still think they were good and it made a good looking boogeyman to me. The story was good. I liked this one better than the 2nd Boogeyman because the Boogeyman was actually real in this one. He was quick and had some ""throwing around"" of the actors at the final confrontation of the Boogeyman. I think this movie deserved alot better than what it got. Its one of my fav. horror/suspense movies so far because of a good bad guy and an alright story. The end was okay, but overall i think the story and the actual Boogeyman were pretty good.

2253982,2,B0007Z2556,"I just saw this movie the other day thinking that it was going to be a remake of the The Boogeyman from 1980!! Well to my chagrin not only was it not a remake of that brilliant 80's classic but it also just didn't deliver the goods like it did either!! This movie was not horrible by any means,but it was very wanting in the scares and victims department. I mean what could they have possibly been thinking anybody would have found the least bit interesting about a horror movie where nothing much happens throughout the majority of it? To say nothing of the fact that there's neither any nudity nor much in the way of victims being killed by The so-called Boogeyman at all. So what do we have left then? Well let's see Barry Watson trying to deal with a childhood trauma while going from place to place with his homely and uninteresting not to mention pushy girlfriend. YAY!! LOL!! And the rest of the time he's either running into this really cute little girl named Franny or riding around with sexy ""Bones"" star Emily Deschanel. And the rest of the time he's alone walking around his old house AIMLESSLY!!! When his incredibly lame girlfriend gets seized by the Boogeyman for some reason we neither see her later on nor find out exactly what happened to her. For what it's worth I was seriously hoping for a sex/nude scene between Barry Watson and Emily Deschanel, but greatly to my chagrin it never happened. Needless to say with how dull the rest of the movie proved to be that just might have kept me from dozing off as I would've done had the movie been longer. Also for what it's worth the movie didn't need any of that corny zooming closely at the furniture and the doors and stuff. 'Cmon was that B.S. really necessary?! And when we finally come to his face-off against the Boogeyman, all we see is Barry and Emily being sucked towards the closet, only for him to need to just simply break a creepy doll and a plasma ball and then kick The Boogeyman in the head. And then all Barry does is look out the window. The only reason to even watch this borefest is just to see the impressive/precocious actress who played Franny!! She was excellent!!",1226275200,2,2153,4.467005076142132
2253983,1,B0007Z2556,"I rented this one on a whim, having heard nothing about it and knowing nothing of the cast or director.  It didn't look that great, but I always liked the folkloric ""boogeyman"" character and I figured if nothing else it would be worth some cheap thrills and a bit of fun.  I was wrong.

""Boogeyman"" is one of the most disjointed, obtuse and utterly unenjoyable flicks I have seen for a long time.  The first few minutes are so predictable it is almost like a parody of better horror films, and then things just get worse. Bad (or non-existent) plot.  Bad acting. Bad CGI monster that looks like it was recycled from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy/dp/B0018BD9FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy</a>.  Just bad in general.

The main character, Barry Watson, thinks acting consists of trying to strike the most brooding pose possible.  He plays the male in possibly the most uninteresting love-triangle put to film, with his gorgeous, rich, caring girlfriend (Tory Mussett) on one side, and his plain-jane tomboy childhood sweetheart (Zooey Deschanel's sister Emily Deschanel) on the other.  There is no real conflict here, and the gals just appear and disappear as the plot calls for it, moon a bit over our brooding hero, and then...exit the stage when their cue is called.  Oh, and of course there is a pre-requisite ""spooky little kid"" character (Skye McCole Bartusiak), and if you can't figure out her story about five minutes following her appearance than you haven't been watching any horror films for the past 10 years.  Even if you slog through the whole flick, there is no resolution.  Is the boogeyman real or not?  Did certain characters die or not?  What exactly is going on?  You will never know...

This DVD comes with a few extra features, including an interview with the director, Stephen T. Kay.  I was almost more interested in this than the movie, because I was curious as to how he could justify the train-wreck he made.  I was even more annoyed when I heard him talking about how he wanted to emulate Japanese and Korean horror movies, and that was his goal when making ""Boogeyman"".  I happen to be a fan of Asian horror flicks, and I can say that he widely missed the mark.  He scratches only the most surface areas of the genre, while ignoring all of the rich cultural mythology and depth that make the films work.  Clearly, Stephen T. Kay should stick to his role as ""Reginald Jennings"" on the soap opera General Hospital, and stay away from the back of a movie camera.  Based on this film, he is a director to avoid.

The one good thing that I have to say about ""Boogeyman"" is that it is beautifully photographed, and both props and sympathies go to the cinematographer, whose talents where fully wasted on this amateur-hour production.",1223856000,6,2817,4.909090909090909

No blood and guts, does not rely heavily on sound effects - this is a movie from someone who understood terror on a very fundamental level and put it in a movie.

Thankfully, general consensus seems to agree with my humble opinion that this movie was all about using the known legend of the boogeyman to get people's attention, don't bother writing a script or developing a plot, don't feel the need to explain any of what's happening....just throw a couple of 'pretty' college age kids on the screen, add some reasonable special effects in a couple of scenes, suddenly startle the audience a few times (such as when a guy's driving down a road with his mind wandering, suddenly have a bird fly into his windshield for no reason, just to startle the audience and make up for the fact that the flick has nowhere to go), occasionally lean on eerie lighting and shadows, etc.....and before you know it, you have a movie.  I figure this movie is worth 2 stars, because there are a few mildly entertaining scenes with decent special effects.  And, it is a good movie to put in the DVD player late at night if you're having trouble falling asleep, and you need something to put you to sleep.  But all in all, this movie is a very transparent attempt to make money using an established premise like the Boogeyman to get people's attention, and then hope that special effects and 'pretty' demographically-ideal-aged actors will make up for the lack of actually MAKING A MOVIE!  A final hint to the filmmakers:  If you wanted to make a flick that so transparently relies on nothing but fluff, nudity and sex are sure-fire ways of getting people to pay attention to you.  Try THAT next time.  Okay?",1213920000,2,1672,4.679180887372014

I had a hard time believing the directors would be able to pull off a decent movie and I was right. Horrid acting, horrid story, horrid everything. I think the only time I jumped was when the movie ended and I had to jump off the couch to take it out of the player. Lame, pathetic, and unmemorable. Another movie destined for the bargin bin.

2253988,2,B0007Z2556,"I just need to first say that I would probably really give this 2.5 stars instead of a flat out 2.  That being said, this movie actually managed to beat the incredibly low expectations I had for it.  Not that this ended up being a really great film, it just wasn't as terrible as I thought it would be.  I wouldn't even remotely class this as a horror film after seeing it; it's more like a suspense or thriller film from my point of view.  The story line is hardly original, as I'm sure anyone could guess by the title, but it was a fairly interesting take on the old childhood tale.

Basically the premise of the film is that as a child Barry Watson's character, Tim, witnessed his father being taken by the Boogeyman.  Naturally no one believed his story and said he manifested the idea because his father really ran off.  However, he spends the rest of his life being frightened of closets and so forth.  So, when the other reviewers say the first portion of the film spends a good deal of time staring at slightly ajar closets, they're right.  Personally, these parts are hilarious and give your friends and you time to laugh at the sequence and its general absurdity.  The fact that Barry Watson is actually a good actor really made this movie fairly decent.  His blonde girlfriend on the other hand was just annoying.  Anyway, the Boogeyman never stops pestering Tim and those around him and really adds to the general concept that all the stories are real, which makes the movie suspenseful.  However, I have to say I really didn't find it scary and as another reviewer pointed out can easily be watched with some younger people (it is rated PG-13 after all), because there is very little violence or gore.

This movie was fairly decent up until the end.  The end was pretty cheesy in my opinion.  I understand what they were doing and how the Boogeyman was created/made up, but it was still kind of silly (again, it's a children's story, I know).  I was hoping for more of an adult revelation towards the end though, like some sort of occult/ancient dark spirit concept that just flowed and would actually be more frightening.  We didn't get that in this film though, it almost went in that direction when Tim learned about a guy who tried to understand the entity, but they never really built up that more realistic fear factor.

Naturally this type of movie isn't going to blow me away and it's certainly not something I'll be watching over and over again.  It's an overly simple and basic movie and it really doesn't hold a huge amount of merit in that, but up till the end I did enjoy the mystery and the adventure of trying to figure things out.  I thought that part was at least fairly well written.  If you really have nothing to do and this movie is playing on TV then I wouldn't say you're going to waste your time watching it, but other than that I wouldn't really seek this movie out.  Just don't have high expectations and you'll get some enjoyment I suspect.  Maybe I just have a more positive outlook on this because I was expecting an actually terrible film with absolutely no coherent story or good acting!

Ultimately, people blame the director if things don't go well. I actually wanted to, for my own mascocistic reasons, watch the special features...just to maybe get an idea of why this movie turned out as bad as it did...most blame the director.

First of all anyone who stars in a movie and tries to look like Bryan ""I'm so Gay"" Seacrest from American Idol fame, needs to die a horrible death in a movie like this. Strike one. Second, we have a rich blond chick, and a redheaded country girl. Both are pretty and neither show any skin. Strike two.

And her comes strike three. When we finally get to see this 'Boogyman', it is a cut-rate CGI monster that looks like it was done by a tenth grader for extra credit in some kind of AV class. I mean seriously, the Boogyman looked like a mix of a teenager's drawing of Iron Maiden's 'Eddie', and 'The Shadow' from the old comic books. If you are going to scare me with a monster, it better be a monster and not some ridiculous looking CGI effect gone wrong.

The plot is simple enough. A kid has been traumatized since he was 8 years old when he saw the Boogyman drag his father into the closet. He is now 23 and is STILL seeing a child's psychiatrist. After his mother's funeral he goes back to the house, on the advice that it will cure him of his fear of the dark and of closets. How can I watch a movie about a guy spending the night in a haunted house with ghosts and a Boogyman running around and I am not frightened once?? Go figure.

The film also has no closure. The Boogyman is destroyed by counting to six?? Are you for real??? And what about the blond girlfriend? Don't you think the cops will find his bloody fingerprints on the bathtub at the motel? And what about the disappearance of Uncle Eddie?

Do you know what all of these things have in common? If you said they were epic disasters that claimed human lives, you win a prize. You might question the inclusion of that last item, the film directed by Stephen T. Kay and produced by none other than Sam Raimi. How could a movie claim lives? ""Boogeyman"" likely killed no one (the number of fatalities aren't in yet), but I think it's safe to say that this clunker claimed the career of one Barry Watson, a former cast member of ""7th Heaven"" and a one time co-star of popular actress Jessica Biel. It must kill Barry that Biel's star keeps rising while his founders in dreck like this. That's Hollywood for you. Then again, Watson didn't seem to understand an important horror film fact, one that angers fans of the genre to no end. That fact, in a nutshell, is this: WE HATE PG-13 RATED HORROR FILMS! ""Horror"" and ""PG-13"" don't go together, period. We want blood and guts and scares. We do not want Barry Watson in a PG-13 rated horror flick.

""Boogeyman"" starts off promising (Then again, so did I. Now look where I've ended up--reviewing films like this one.) as we see a young kid in bed at night, horrified of the creature that lives in his closet. Dad ambles in just in time to explain that there is no such thing as the ""Boogeyman"" immediately prior to the non-existing Boogeyman pulling him into the closet. Dad, despite a brief reappearance seconds later, disappears forever. Flash forward fifteen years (too bad we can't flash forward to the closing credits), and we now see the aforementioned little tyke, Tim Jensen, suddenly assume the form of a grown up Barry Watson. Tim, who also seems to fear an electric shaver, tries to move on with his life the best he can. He's a big shot at a magazine, and he's involved with a beautiful girl named Jessica (Tory Mussett). There's some song and dance about meeting her parents--I don't know...I wasn't paying attention--followed by scenes showing Jensen's obvious fear of closets. A few minutes later, Tim experiences some sort of vision/dream concerning his mother (played by Lucy Lawless) that forces him to return to his childhood home.

In short, Mom died. This means Tim has to attend her funeral and then go back to the domicile alone. After a ridiculous scene on the road, Jensen arrives at a house so run down it makes the Addams family digs look like the Trump Towers. He soon runs into a childhood friend, Kate (Emily Deschanel paying her mortgage), before the real weirdness starts. Some of the strangeness involves an enigmatic youngster named Franny (Skye McCole Bartusiak). Most of it involves the reappearance, and subsequent disappearance, of Tim's girlfriend Jessica. Soon the madness engulfs Kate as well. People appear and then disappear with frightening regularity, usually after entering a closet. Time and space mean nothing as Tim lurches from one improbable reality to another. Needless to say, it's the Boogeyman who stands behind this lunacy. Or is it Tim? Kate suspects he did something sinister to his girlfriend. Maybe Jensen's fear of the Boogeyman, coupled with the return to his childhood home, has resulted in a psychotic break of epic proportions. Never fear, however, as the conclusion explains everything in dreary detail. As an aside, the end of ""Boogeyman"" ranks as one of the lamest showdowns I've ever seen during my cinematic excursions.

Where to start with this nightmare? Other reviewers have rightly noted the mind-deadening reliance on sound effects to get a cheap scare out of the audience, so I won't go there except to say they're absolutely, positively correct. I could rail against the jarring editing techniques, so overused here that they negate any impact the film might have had on an audience above the age of fourteen. The acting isn't any better. With the exception of Emily Deschanel, one wonders what medication the rest of the cast took before stepping in front of the camera. My guess is Thorazine. Except for Barry Watson during the scenes where he grooves along the walls in the closet. In this instance, his behavior closely mirrors someone on the last day of a month long cough syrup binge. I think it's safe to say that just about every element of ""Boogeyman"" fails to project serious scares. The lack of gore and the lack of a scary monster is just the icing on this terrible tasting cake. Here's something truly scary, though: ""Boogeyman 2"" is coming to a theater near you in the future! How is that remotely possible? Because this movie grossed 46 million dollars! Gawd help us!

The movie looks great, and sounds great, on DVD. No problem there. As for supplements, we get a few deleted scenes, some special effects mumbo jumbo, a documentary that devolves into a lovefest between cast and crew, some animated storyboards, and an alternate ending. Trailers for a few other films round out the disc. I'm greatly disappointed that I spent ninety minutes of my life watching this crud. It's not scary, not bloody, and not that well acted. The idea isn't bad, especially the mind bending second half where we start to question the reality of what's going on, but it's not unique and comes far too late to save the film. I'm actually agonizing over whether to give ""Boogeyman"" one or two stars. I guess I'll go with the latter, as I usually round up when in doubt.

The opening sequence of the film is a tense experience which shows the  film's hero - Tim as a kid, experiencing the usual night terrors involving a closet and darkness. However, when his reassuring father is actually snatched by something in the closet in front of his eyes, the poor lad then develops a very understandable terror of closets which continues into adulthood.

Years later Tim (well played by Barry Watson)returns to his family house, following the death of his mother, after having lived away for years,  and has to confront the monster that is responsible for taking his father years ago.

Barry Watson makes Tim a sympathetic hero who has to cope with the terror of his past, and a circle of family and friends who believe that his father walked out, as opposed to what he saw on that night.

The film is atmospheric and jumpy in places. Sadly though it is badly let down by a CGI monster which could have been far more effectively depicted by a live actor in make up.

Hardly a horror masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, this film is at best average entertainment from the genre. Something to bung on the DVD player and fill up a bit of dead time with basically.",1169164800,,1273,4.51304347826087

The director here was terrible. Silence followed by an bang will make you jump, but in this movie it happens every five minutes like clockwork. Stephen Kaye has no clue about atmosphere or building tension. The main character literally could not walk down a hallway without a jump cut and the ever present 'scary sound'.

It's not all the fault of the director though. I felt like this movie started as a good idea, then the script was re-written a hundred times by twenty different people. A bunch of ideas came up and went nowhere. What was the deal with the 'teleporting closet' for instance?

*Spoiler if you care about spoilers for this crummy movie* When the boogeyman finally shows up he's just a badly CG animated bald guy. Why CG? Were they not able to find any creepy looking bald actors? My guess is that when they read the script for this turkey, every one of them turned it down.",1161043200,4,1473,5.566964285714286

This movie is much different from the first Boogeyman that was released years earlier. This one had a story and at times was truley scarey with great special effects. Again, this is a much better movie than the older version.",1159574400,6,385,4.436619718309859
2253999,1,B0007Z2556,"It's sad when a commercial is superior to the movie, but the boogeyman is an example of that particular reality.  Even renting this film is a waste of time. Had they attempted to explain the entire thing with Tim being a schizophrenic who flipped out and killed everyone, but hallucinated the boogeyman doing it, then that would've probably saved the film, but it didn't end that way.

Tim is the typical screwed up, scared of the closet kid, only about twenty years too old, being traumatized by having seen his father get mangled in the closet by the boogeyman. After posing for the first twenty minutes as having rewritten this event into just a way of dealing with his father's leaving (not very convincing, by the way), he goes home after his mother's death and decides to face his old fears by spending a night in the house he grew up in. Then follows a group of messily edited, badly written, and confusing events that make no sense and are not even remotely explained.

For no apparent reason, he drags along for about an hour an old childhood friend named Kate, who conveniently keeps showing up with only flimsy contrived excuses.  She rides over to his house on a horse which for no reason throws her off; he has no food so she rides her bike late at night over to bring him some.

None of this would be that bad if it wasn't for the fact that the last fifteen minutes were a series of absurd events. His excessively touchy-feely girlfriend shows up, drives him to a motel, and vanishes. He goes into a closet and comes out in his old house's closet and jumps at Kate (there to give the gift of food). He goes and chats with a girl, who was following him around asking about the boogeyman who then was dead but still showing up, being a kind of spiritual advisor on destroying childhood demons. He goes into closets and appears in different buildings, sometimes under beds, gets pulled under beds and comes out closets, and something about nailing a chair in front of a closet and facing the boogeyman turns into him smashing and destroying everything in his old room as a means of destroying the boogeyman. It would have been all okay had it been the delusions of a madman, with his sudden appearances elsewhere being blackouts and flashes of memory. But no, it was supposed to be a real, non-CGI boogeyman. The result was a cheesy, boring, 90 minute film that should've ended way sooner, because even at a hour and a half, it went too long. It could've been good if it had just not tried to make the whole boogeyman thing a literal thing, but of course, they didn't.

And what was that with his girlfriend? He walks through a closet and finds himself in the motel bathroom where she vanished, sees gray water pouring out of the faucet, then she pops out of the water a few times to be apparently drowned or at least repeatedly covered with splashing dirty water by some watery manifestation of, yes, the boogeyman. Then he goes to his room, with the ever present Kate, smashed a few toys, and everything was peachy.

I've watched horror movies since about the age of six, a good eleven years, from Nightmare on Elm St., to the Hammer films, to Dracula (about forty of them), to Evil Dead, and this one just sucks.  There are so many better horror movies to choose from.",1157155200,6,3282,4.504201680672269
2254000,4,B0007Z2556,"I enjoyed the Boogeyman. I have never heard of the flick before viewing it, and expected it to have the same old cookie cutter slasher elements in it. What I found was that it was devoid of cliches, devoid of gore and violence, high of chills and frights, and a darn good film.

Barry Watson plays Tim, a man who is deathly afraid of the Boogeyman. The Boogeyman is a evil force of some sort that lives in closets. Tim is forced to return home, where he faces old memories and the Boogeyman.

Overall, there was much to like about the film. The acting was great. Barry Watson did a wonderful job, and the cast around him was great as well. The story was fresh, and completely devoid of every horror movie cliche. This alone makes it worth watching.

The Boogeyman also didn't have the 200 gallons of blood and endless gore that seems to be clogging film these days. Director Stephen Kay and Writer Eric Kripke remember that frights scare people, not mass quantities of severed body parts and gallons of blood. The Boogeyman was scary because of the story, and not because of severed limbs.

While liking the film, I do have a couple of things I didn't care about it. First, the Boogeyman, when seen, looked very CGI and amateurish. It was more terrifying before we got to see the Boogeyman. Secondly, there were a few plot points that were left untied. The movie didn't have enough closure for me.

Lastly, the Boogeyman could have been a great film, but ended up being only very good. With a great combo of acting, writing and pacing, the stories had all the elements to be the best horror movie I have seen all year. But alas, something was missing. For me, I think the missing element was how the ending was handled. The pacing up until the last 30 minutes was suspenseful, but once the Boogeyman reared its head, the movie almost seemed to move too fast, lose its frightening characteristics, and become another film.

The Boogeyman is a movie that I would highly recommend to fans of horror who want a refreshing change, or for couples looking for a good scare without violence and blood. Its not so great that I would buy it, but good enough where it is a must see.

Total Score (out of 100) = 71

37 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.

9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?

2254001,4,B0007Z2556,"Boogeyman oozes with fear, primarily because Barry Watson is fantastic at showing the panicky, childish fear we all know is deep within ourselves.  This fear is the centerpiece of Boogeyman; this is not a slasher or gorefest movie.  The Ring, Darkness Falls, and Jeepers Creepers are other recent Hollywood releases that are scary in similar ways.  The cinematography, editing, and overall direction by Stephen Kay are first-rate.  There really is no sound track, but rather a nearly continuous series of creepy sound-effects that increasingly prickle the nerves (in a good/creepy way) as the movie runs.  The combination make watching Boogeyman a genuinely scary experience.

One wonders through most of the movie whether this really is about a supernatural, literal Boogeyman, or perhaps a digression into the mind of sick young man who was psychologically deranged by his father's locking him in closets as a youngster and then running off, leaving a seriously depressed wife and emotionally damaged son.  Some aspects of the movie brought to mind Identity, and Hide and Seek.  Without giving anything away, suffice it to say that the resolution to Boogeyman's story does not satisfy either as a monster movie or as a psychological thriller.

It is surprising that this movie doesn't rate higher, as all but the final 10 minutes are quite good.  Unfortunately, the ending is often what's remembered, and perhaps that's part of the reason for the low ratings.  Expectations from Raimi's involvement (which apparently was very slight) and Evil Dead are sure to disappoint; Boogeyman is a completely different type of movie.  Even so, Boogeyman is very scary throughout (unless blood-n-guts are required to scare you), and is overall a very good movie.

The Special Edition DVD has an alternate ending that is quite good (perhaps superior), being very different from that in the movie.  I usually skip watching the deleted scenes, but am glad I watched them here; many are great, e.g., Watson once again excelling in his portrayal of a visceral revulsion to a maggot-ridden rabbit falling on him.  Two ""Making of"" features are also well done, and compensate for the lack of a commentary track for the movie.

2254002,2,B0007Z2556,"I recently noticed that many reviewers have already posted negative reviews on this page. I should have visited here long before, at least before watching this terrible film in the empty theater in Japan (where they released it theatrically in June, 2006). Yes, you are right, folks. The film is horrible. The sole merit of `Boogeyman' is its atmospheric photography, and in this film the atmospheric photography means a dilapidated house where some evil force lurks somewhere behind the door. and nothing more.

The rest of the `Boogeyman' is about how to make a horror film out of clichd techniques and unbelievably stupid behaviors of the characters. But to be fair, the story itself is not without merit. Barry Watson plays one young non-descript guy Tim, whose father is, he believes, killed by the `Boogeyman' hiding in the closet when he was a little boy. Now, though nobody believes him, Tim thinks the evil monster comes back, hiding again somewhere in his old house, but is he really sane? Or he could be simply clinging to the delusion.

When the film needs subtle direction, director Stephen T. Kay insists on fast cuts and loud noise, overusing the flashy camera works. You will surely jump in the seat a few times because he uses the hackneyed technique to scare people -- some big loud sound that jolts you out of sleep. In fact, we need the jolt because the film, lacking the ability to build up the suspense, is pretty sleep-inducing.

As to the stupidity of the characters, it is just beyond belief. They are so willing to risk their lives, like one lady entering someone else's house at night without permission, calling `Tim? Where are you?' Usually we leave and come back tomorrow, don't we? Anyway, Barry Watson is not the right choice for the film, whose character just cannot engage our attention, and nor is the `Boogeyman' itself with the terrible CGI.

The film comes from Ghost House Pictures (which gave us disappointing `The Grudge'), produced by Sam Raimi. There is, however, nothing that would remind us of the flair of Raimi, except the camera shot that slowly sweeps around on the floor.

2254006,2,B0007Z2556,"When the trailer first came out, I thought we had a truly magnificent horror on the way. Something that was going to delve into and bring alive our childhood fears that lurked in the dark and behind creaky doors left slightly a jar. I waited for months for it to be available on DVD after I had missed it at the Movie Cinema.

The build up was the most exciting part of the whole movie and due to that, the slump and boredom that followed in the movie was made 10x worse.

Probably the biggest let down I've had on a DVD ever...

First off, the story picks up with an awesome opening scene, which is quite terrifying and then slumps along at such a slow pace, and never really picks up enough to get us interested again.

Barry Watson looks half asleep for the majority of the film and really does not portray anything that resembles a memorable / likeable character. He seems to call his performance in and allows the special effects and storyline to do much of the work. His supporting cast are just as miserable... and really leaves nothing to work with.

So... a few 'frights' here and there and a small build up at the end to what we've all come to see ""THE BOOGEYMAN"" and he is the most pathetic visual effect of the whole. I would have at least spent a bit on a Rick Baker monster with blood covered fangs, claws, deep set eyes and rotting flesh and a heavy breathing. What we get is a 100% computer generated blur which at best is as scary as brushing your teeth with 'shaving cream' instead of toothpaste! Really dissapointing...

And what the hell was that 'into' / 'out of' / 'into' / 'out of' closet sequence that felt like the director needed to stretch the film from just over an hour and bit to a 'full length' flick...

A classic example is in the scene with his girlfriend being eaten by the bathub. He sees bloody fingerprints on the tub and leaves, then later on he reappears and makes those same fingerprints, leaving us to think ""hey, this isn't so bad after all, maybe he's the boogie man!"" Just as we are starting to think that there may actually be an interesting plot twist, nope, he isn't, just messing with you, leaving us to wonder A) What the point of him showing up at all was and B) Why the girlfriend got eaten by the bathtub (given that the Boogeyman seems to only appear out of closets and reveals himself later to have quite a different concrete form, it must've been some other beastie with nothing to do with the plot!)

It's a decent story and it is at least somewhat spooky, but it is by no means a horror film.  There are many boring lulls in the movie that will lose your attention quite easily.  The boogeyman looks pretty freaky, when you finally see him, but only for the first few shots, that are CGI mixed with someone in actual makeup.

Not to mention the countless other horror attrocities that have gone directly to video/DVD.

To be fair the ""Amityville"" remake was technically better than the original and the newer ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a pretty good time-waster with some genuine thrills. Even some straight-to-video releases such as ""Dead Birds"" and ""Toolbox Murders"" had their moments but they were not on the same level as some of the earlier classics such as ""Black Christmas"", ""Halloween"", ""The Shining"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Suspiria"", ""The Changeling"", ""The Howling"", ""An American Werewolf In London""... you get my point? Judging by Hollywood's recent track record, I'm getting the impression that today's film-maker's really don't give a darn about the ""horror"" genre. Which is a shame because there are millions of horror film fans out there just waiting for that one horror masterpiece.

The wait will continue because BOOGEYMAN isn't it. As a matter of fact, this film has got to be the worst horror film of the last 10 years.

The film stars a very stiff Barry Watson (whom I believe has no facial muscles since his expression does not seem to change for the duration of this film) who plays a traumatized magazine editor who returns to his childhood home to confront his childhood fear- the CGI created title character. Sounds interesting? It really isn't. Maybe with a different cast, different script and a different director, this may have been worth the while but everything about this film is ""bottom-of-the-barrell"". The entire adult cast including Lucy Lawless is stiff and uninspired. The child protaganist Skye McCole Bartusiak doesn't fare any better. I never thought the day would come that I'd utter these unfortunate words: ""Dakota Fanning- where are you?""

As for the Boogeyman himself, once he's revealed to the viewer, he is as frightening as Gonzo from ""The Muppet Show"". But wait, even the muppets have more depth, more character than this flat, dreary, one-dimensional entity created using someone's laptop.

There is an obscure, low-budget, early 80's horror film called ""The Boogeyman"" starring the life-less (I am sensing a trend here) Suzanne Love and the always creepy John Carradine. Although it is no masterpiece and the film suffers greatly from it's obvious low-budget and bad acting, it is still a lot more entertaining and creative than this stinker. ""Boogeyman""(2005) has nothing to recommend it. There's not one memorable scene or character. Even as a B-movie this fails.

If it's thrills, chills and action you're looking for then watch an episode of ""Iron Chef-America"" and thank me later.

As if I could really spoil this movie...

So the movie starts when a kid's dad gets yanked into the closet and killed by the Boogeyman when he's like 8 years old and it's super traumatic and all that. This kid grows up and has trouble coping and dealing with the world. Well, I guess I would be too if the Boogeyman killed my dad. But our hero, Tim, has trouble convincing the rest of the world that the Boogeyman killed his dad. They're all convinced that he's just constructed the whole thing to help him deal with the fact that his dad walked out on him and his mom. Losing his dad has turned Tim into a pretty morose adult. His girlfriend is getting more than a little sick of his antics.

So when Mom dies, Tim returns home to confront his inner demons. The whole time we are supposed to be wondering if there really is a Boogeyman or if Tim really has gone off the deep end. Most of the movie is spent with that ambiguity in place, which means that not a lot really happens. Tim spends a lot of time exploring his house, having the obligatory flashbacks to his troubled youth, when his father would lock him in the closet to try and get him over his fear of the Boogeyman. He sees scary stuff, then turns around and the scary stuff isn't there anymore. He laughs nervously to himself. That sucks up about 70 minutes of screen time.

Tim meets a little girl named Franny, who's been following him around and watching him carefully. Franny tells Tim that her dad tried to kill the Boogeyman, but he wasn't strong enough to face it. She really doesn't serve any other purpose in the movie, other than to be the sage ghost (yes, she turns out to be a ghost) who tells our hero how to defeat the bad guy. When Tim finally beats the Boogeyman in the end of the movie, it's by a means that is so ridiculous, that you really can't help but feel completely let down. This is a Boogeyman that has none of the style or panache of his predecessors: Freddy, Jason, Michael, Pinhead or even Chucky.

In the end, I felt a little like how I felt after watching THE LAST HORROR MOVIE. With a title like BOOGEYMAN, it really should have been a much better movie. If you take it upon yourself to call your movie BOOGEYMAN, then you better make sure that your Boogeyman is better than any of the ones that came before it.",1133827200,2,2344,4.3061224489795915

This involves the fabled boogeyman who lurks in the closet; you know, the kind that you were afraid of when you were a kid.  Now while this premise actually sounds kind of enticing for a horror movie, the end result isn't just an incoherent, predictable, and really uneventful schlock-fest; it's a completely laughable waste of film that is more a comedy of errors than a thriller.  What's worth noting here is that Sam Raimi, director of the cult classic Evil Dead series as well as the wildly popular Spider-Man films, helped produce this film (as well as the Grudge, one of the aforementioned PG-13 rated Japanese horror re-makes), and it's a sad surprise that he would be involved with this waste.",1132704000,3,1128,4.739795918367347

We know what is eventually going to happen, but the suspense builds up perfectly with great details.

I first watched this in the theater. My husband & I jumped several times and a few people actually screamed out loud at a number of scenes. The atmosphere in it was great - dark and creepy. We left the theater saying how it was the first scary movie we saw in a long time that we actually got scared at. Most horror/scary movies these days rely too much on gore and blood. That doesn't make a movie scary, you can see that on the Discovery Health channel. It's the little details, suspense and overall plot that make a movie scary.

As a horror fan, I found Boogeyman to be decent although fairly predictable and I would have been far happier without the ""happy ending"" element.  There were some good things going on, nice interaction between characters and some nice cinematography.

It's completely free of any sort of entertainment whatsoever. The characters aren't likeable, they're dumb. The plot is alternately mind-bogglingly stupid and confusing.

2254040,3,B0007Z2556,"When are Hollywood writers and directors going to learn?  Once you show us the ""monster,"" it's no longer scary.  I don't understand this obsession with CGI and special effects; this movie isn't original by any means, but it works reasonably well - until the special effects guys take over toward the end.  Besides showing us what the Boogeyman looks like, they also give us a climax that is much ado about nothing.  Apparently, they believed that they could cover up the flatline of an ending by making us dizzy and distracting us with the power of giant fans off-screen.  It's disappointing because Boogeyman could have been a pretty good scary movie.

There is a reason that this kind of thing-in-the-closet movie with all of the standard horror clich&eacute;s keeps being made - quite simply, it works to some degree.  At some point in our childhoods, we all were scared of the dark and the monster in the closet (or under the bed), and my own feeling is that we adults are also - deep down inside - still a little afraid of the proverbial Boogeyman.  Silly it may be, but I wouldn't go to sleep with a closet door left open for all the tea in China.  The basic premise works because we can all identify with it.  Boogeyman starts out following the traditional path - the child in bed intro, the spooky closet door phobia, the creepy old house where everything squeaks, and the movement of nasty little somethings just outside our field of vision.  Then the filmmakers expanded things out a little and added another perspective - that's okay, even though I and probably most viewers saw right through it from the very beginning.  Then they just blew it.

Not only did the filmmakers put a face on the Boogeyman, they decided to make the latter stages of Boogeyman really weird, completely pulling the rug of believability out from under the entire audience.  As long as Tim (Barry Watson) is continually dealing with his fear of dark closets and all the other creepy aspects of his childhood home, you're pretty much right there with him.  Then the movie sort of slaps you in the face and tells you it's just a movie by introducing impossible twists and then bringing the Boogeyman out of the closet.  This causes an immediate disconnect with the audience, and so it is that the final big scenes are more laughable than frightening - and, since we're not completely wrapped up in the big special effects ending, we have time to think about a few weaknesses that turned up earlier in the story.

Although I thought the movie was rather effective up to a point toward the end, I have to round my 3.5 stars down to three.  Boogeyman does have some spooky elements to it, but it doesn't answer all the questions it raises, its twists are a little too easy to see through, and the big ending leaves you feeling limp rather than excited - and, like several others, I had a few Darkness Falls d&eacute;j&agrave; vu moments while I was watching the movie.  If they had just left the Boogeyman in the closet where he belongs, this might have been a four star effort.

On a final note, I would just alert viewers to the presence of a tiny bonus scene at the end, following the final credits - it's not much to sneeze at, but it's there.",1125014400,3,3229,4.563258232235702
2254041,1,B0007Z2556,"Is it just me or did anyone else notice that ""Boogeyman"" is almost a scene for scene rip off of the much better 2003 movie, ""Darkness Falls""?

Don't believe me?  Check it out:

1) Both movies open with a young boys in their bedrooms at night who are afraid to go to sleep because they fear that mythical beings from folklore will come and harm them.  In ""Darkness Falls,"" it's a vengeful Tooth Fairy.  In the Boogeyman it's well, duh, the Boogeyman.

2) In both movies these scenes end with the young boys watching in helpless terror as said mythical beings slaughter a parent.  In ""Darkness Falls,""  Mom buys the farm.  In ""Boogeyman"" it's Dad that gets it.

3)  After the previous scene, both movies jump forward several years to the same boys as young men.  In both cases, they remain so traumatized by the prior events that they've even adapted their living quarters to fend off future attacks they believe will one day come.  In ""Darkness"" hero Chaney Kley's apartment has more lights than the Las Vegas strip since the Tooth Fairy can only exist in darkness.  In ""Boogeyman,"" every closet or cupboard in Barry Watson's apartment is windowed so that he can see if the Boogeyman is hiding inside before opening.

4)  In both movies, the young heroes are forced by a tragic events to return to their hometowns where they must face the evils that have haunted their dreams since childhood.  And once they hit town, both young men immediately reconnect with old childhood flames who've not surprisingly grown up into serious hotties.

5) Lastly, both movies also end with frantic, climaxes where the young heroes use their wits to dispatch their supernatural enemies in explosive finishes.

Seriously, I could go on but what's point?  There is one significant difference here though.  ""Darkness Falls"" is actually an okay movie where as ""Boogeyman"" kinda sucks.

To its credit, the opening scene(though as I said it's a ripoff) is a killer and had me genuinely creeped out.  But after that the movie descends into scene after scene of Watson  moping around.

The few original story elements the movie does try to use like the Boogeyman and his origins don't work.  The movie doesn't really explain who or what the Boogeyman is though there are suggestions that any child who fears the Boogeyman deeply enough can make him real.

Bottom line this one's not only a loser but also such a blatant ripoff of ""Darkness Falls"" that if I were the attorney for the scriptwriter of that film I'd probably recommend filing a copyright infringement lawsuit.",1124928000,13,2546,4.779816513761468
2254042,4,B0007Z2556,"...and the unbelievable low rating of ""The Boogeyman"" here on amazon.com makes me wonder if the reviewers were watching this horror-movie with their eyes closed..?

It is a solid 4 stars-out-of-6-movie, and I honestly wonder what the average viewer did expect from a movie by the title of ""Boogeyman"". Is a horror-movie deep and moving? And usually smart? Well, I guess ""The Others"" and ""Sixth Sence"" could be described as this -but there is a big difference here between this old-fashioned horror-design and the ""new"" thriller-wave that's made its' mark since ""Sixth Sence"". I did not expect much explanation from ""Boogeyman"", I only expected to be entertained -and I was!

""Boogeyman"" is simply horror. ""The monster in the closet/under the bed"", the sound-effects that makes you jump or scream (and great sound by the way, dts in the European-edition is amazing), it is based on our worst fears when we are children -and sure brings back some memories of our darkest fantasies. ""Boogeyman"" is so intense that I actually thought it was a little too much at times. The camera-work is great and effective, it takes you where you don't want to go -and I sometimes found myself holding my breath. Perhaps I'm easily scared, I don't know -but I really don't understand that so many people here did not find ""Boogeyman"" scary at all..? And boring? I felt like something was thrown at me constantly while watching, and it really had my attention...

...until;

Here is also another ending that ruins the movie, and it could have been made/designed even a lot more simplier to make it look more scary. A man wearing a black bathrobe or something would have looked ""better"" than the ""Boogeyman"" turned out to be. More scary, I mean. The ending was just confusing, and silly. I think I liked the original ending better, I don't know... Were the filmmakers trying to be nice to the audience there at the end, and make up for all the horror? Well, the entire ending looked cheap and fake -and when first we get to see (or stand face to face if you like) the ""Boogeyman"" it is no longer scary. A bit of a let-down I must add.

But it is a frightning horror-movie besides this -intense and builds up -in the good-old-fashioned-style. I can recommend this to fans of movies such as ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"".

The shock value is high here... the director hides his wand rather well and doesn't 'scare' you until he is ready... then he throws the fright in your face. I admit there were several times I jumped... heck one time I even had goosebumps!

2254045,1,B0007Z2556,"Someone in the studio said: Hurry!!... Let's make a movie about the Boogeyman before someone else does it!!... Quick! Anything will do... just get me a Boogeyman script!!

Big mistake.

Because this movie has nothing to offer. The story is dull, the characters are flat and both the script and directing go nowhere.

The story is about a kid who witnessed his dad being sucked into the closet by the Boogeyman. Years later, his mom dies and he comes back to hie weird small town to ""confront his fears"". His house is an old victorian house in the middle of nowhere with a funeral home appeal (church-colored windows and all).

First Major flaw: How do you make a film about a mythic monster nobody realy knows how it looks? How do you create a monster that will match all kids' worst nightmare at the same time? Look at all movie monsters. From Santa Claus to King Kong to Freddy Kruger we do know how those characters look, act and move. That's why they are such a delight to watch.

Here, nobody knew what to do in order to have a real monster. The result is that the film spends an awful amount of time avoiding the monster and depending on cheap,fast,loud outbursts of images and noises everytime the main character touches a doorknob... looks into a mirror... or falls asleep.

It is funny (and disappointing) how cheap horror movies nowadays rely on these silly editting effects in order to make the viewers jump on their seats. The result? Nobody jumps anymore because we all know the half-second outburst of loud images is coming when we see the guy's hand slowly approaching the doorknob. The hand goes inch by inch... suddenly half-second of woosh-aaargh-bang!... and then we're back: the guy opens the door and nothing happens... it was just his mind playing tricks. Duh!

Then come all those things we've seen (better made) somewhere alse. The idea of comuncating closets comes from a 1986 (good) movie called ""House"". The sudden alternative recreations of past events comes from (among many others) David Lynch. The bird against the windshield AND the eerie old house come from Hitchcock. The girl we are not so sure is a ghost comes from ""The Sixth Sense""-ish films... boy, this movie is mixed bag of:

a) stollen good ideas

b) ideas that are so bad nobody ever bothered to have them.

The vilain (the Boogeyman) is never there. And when he is, he passes fast in the background when nobody is looking. The whole movie is like this. In the end, the guy wins by doing something so irrelevant I can't even remember what it was (laughs). And yes: its look is disappointing!!! An ugly guy with an elastic body!!!! Can it get worse??? Yes, it can. Because...

...Obviously, the closet will open again for a direct-to-DVD sequel. Want some advice? Buy some naftballs and keep the doors locked.",1123545600,5,2801,4.684317718940937
2254046,2,B0007Z2556,"Supposedly motivated by suspense horror, this film is based upon a man's memory of his past childhood which became more true than he would let his conscience believe. Tim (Barry Watson) confronts his past in order to relieve his present stance of the memory that burdens him daily as he pursues to live a normal person's life.

Taking the advice of his girlfriend and a woman whom he knew as a younger boy after the incident, he journeys back into the old house which he tries to forget. During his stay there, he not only found out the truths of the myth of the Boogeyman (Andrew Glover), his past has also been reintroduced into his life and plays back in his mind like a film he thought he had forgotten and put aside long ago.

Through all the mystery he comes upon the truth of his childhood which haunted him so, about his Dad's death that very night as he was a little boy. He also came upon the truth of the missing children and the old man who tried to capture the Boogeyman himself, single-handedly.

Like I said, a suspense-filled film. The disappointment came with the single fact that the movie failed miserably at the end, like an old horror flick from the 80s. The Boogeyman himself wasn't as well thought out as one would hope and being a big factor, the role of the boogeyman should be more dramatic and significiant than what it is in this movie.

2254047,1,B0007Z2556,"You can learn a lot about how NOT to make a horror movie by watching this film.  The plot concerns The Boogeyman - literally, not metaphorically, as Halloween did.  It begins with a terrified little boy in his bedroom, in the dark, looking nervously at his closet and other menacing objects around the room.  Now, problems with the movie begin right here.  Nobody, I mean NOBODY - not even Rob Zombie - would have a room this creepy for a child.  Who would painstakingly arrange clothes and a baseball bat on a rocking chair to look like a scary monster?  When the little boy's father comes in to investigate, he is sucked into the bedroom closet, never to be seen or heard from again.

Cut to many years later; the little boy has now grown up into an extremely nervous, but good-looking young man.  His mother's death forces him to go back to his old house where the Boogeyman lives.  Now things begin to go REALLY wrong with the movie.  First off, it gets the tone wrong.  The filmmakers try to make EVERY moment creepy - even when nothing is happening.  You just can't do that - horror films need moments of calm reality before going off into moments of high-tension.  Try to keep the tension high at all times effectively nullifies it in this film.

Next, the film makes no logical sense.  Characters just do things that can't be explained by any other reason than ""it advances the plot.""  Why would the hero spend so much time alone in a house with the Boogeyman?  The mythology of the movie doesn't make ANY sense either.  What is the Boogeyman?  Is he omnipotent?  Where does he come from?  What, exactly, does he do with his victims?

As the film lumbers towards its conclusion, things get completely surreal.  The hero goes into ""closetland"" - for lack of a better term - to fight the Boogeyman.  The audience gets completely lost in this convoluted chase.  The payoff - a lame, CGI monster - dispels any sense of dread that might have been created.  And then the movie just stops.

2254050,2,B0007Z2556,"I think though that people are being a bit hard on this film.  It's not ""House of the Dead"" or ""Alone in the Dark"" bad, it's problem is that it's not doing ANYTHING even remotely interesting or inventive on any level.  ""Boogeyman"" is just a clone of both ""Wes Craven's 'They'"" and ""Darkness Falls.""  Neither of which were really memorable for ... well ... much of anything.  In fact I almost felt as if the opening scene when Tim's Dad was taken was almost LIFTED DIRECTLY from ""Darkness Falls.""

I could NEVER recommend buying a copy, but if you wanted to rent it you could do it without feeling robbed.  For that matter, if you need a scary movie for someone a little younger, there's virtually no gore and I didn't notice any foul language.  In that role maybe this has a little bit of value.  Not much, mind you, but maybe a little.",1122508800,,836,4.383116883116883
2254051,2,B0007Z2556,"I just sat through the 1 hour and whatever minutes long trainwreck called ""The boogeyman"" and i have to say i expected worst but that doesnt mean it's not a disaster.

Barry Watson plays a man who as a child his father was Murdered by the boogeyman do you want to know how??? here i'll tell you, he was violently thrown around by the boogeyman like a ragdoll untill he sucked him up in the closet.

Now As a Man he is a very paraniod, traumatized individual, and is scared of closets and bed's.

Sounds Like Oscar Material huh?

When Strange things start to happen around him and the ones he loves start to vanish he must grow some you know what, go to his childhood home and face the big old bad boogeyman.

Yes i know, your on the edge of your seat with suspense.

--The Negatives--

 You get in this movie  Dull-acting from Mr. Watson who never really gets brave in this movie and just seems to be dazed and confused.

You get a Horrible CGI designed looking boogeyman who resembles the CryptKeeper.

--THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM!!-- THIS IS A SURPRISE ELEMENT HORROR FILM--

With only all of a sudden loud sound effects that surprise you,Like the famous ""DUNNN"" sound that comes after enough suspense is built. For example when the guy is reaching towards the closet and ""DUNNN"".

Oh yeah and you get the already played out Dead children alive scare tactic,maybe it was scary in Children of the Corn, not here.

The Positives

I was just laughing at how bad this movie was so the only good thing i got out of it was a few good laughs.

So in Conclusion,

Don't Expect nothing scary from this one,bad acting, bad special effects, cheap scares But Hey isn't every horror movie like this now?????????????

2254055,3,B0007Z2556,"This sounds familiar...
No, not because it's a remake. Because it follows the whole paranoid, death of a parent on his own vein that Darkness Falls did. Only the story falls flat. It starts out as the beginning chapter of a new life for a man with childhood trauma. A unsupportive,useless, and whiny girlfriend who has no on-screen chemistry at all with him. Why was she even in the story? Well, it all ""starts"" when his mother dies, the ""girl"" doesn't get it, and he leaves to check out the house. This is all sketchy. The trailers and previews make you think there's more here - like a plot- but there isn't. FINALLY the movie has started and the search is on for the truth. Another useless and confusing scene involves that stupid girl again when she comes to get him, they leave and go to a low budget motel...she disappears. :) :) :) :) He steps into a closet and finds himself back in his old house. No sense. So that and the idiot ""girlfriend"", they kind of ruin the movie along with that empty plot thing.",1121990400,,1013,4.3936170212765955

2254057,3,B0007Z2556,"Boogeyman was a decent film, didn't scare me, didn't come close, but overall it was a nice film. The boy is tormented by the 'man' and finnaly defeats him as he gets older and ends it all .",1121817600,,189,4.0
2254058,2,B0007Z2556,"Anyone remember those old scary movies like the Exorcist, the Omen or the Birds? Those movies FREAKED people out. People either walked away stunned or they couldn't even watch the rest(like my mom). If you notice there really isn't any ""BOO!"" scenes in them save for maybe 2 really tame ones. But it was the atmosphere and the tone that freaks people out. Lately, it just seems movies want to have ""BOO!""s every 10 minutes and pass it off as a scary movie. Hence, we have Boogeyman.

Tim ever since he was young, believes his father was taken by the Boogeyman. 15 years later and he's still freaked about closets. He goes to his girlfriend's house to meet the folks but gets an odd premonition about his mother's death(which is odd, what's that gotta do with the Boogeyman?). After his funeral he decides to stay in his old house which is uncle is fixing up.

And as usual, things go bump in the night, meets a mysterious girl named Franny who has had someone taken. Tim's old friend Kate comes over and she gets weirded out too about his behaviour. Tim has to step out and face him if he's ever to purge him from his life.

There's 2 overused ""boo"" moments in films: the cat/guy behind a door when we thought it was the ghost/alien/monster and someone walking/running past the camera. In Sixth Sense, it was a woman in a housecoat and it's here too. Then there's the quick flash of images/flashback meant to disorient you but really you end up feeling nothing. It's just a bunch of stuff flashing really quickly.

Performance-wise it's surprising good. Barry Watson is a nice leading man and his old friend is good(not awesome though) by Emily Deschanel. The effects(something that needs to stop too, enough with the CG in horror movies, guys) are passable but not outstanding.

If you have a girl and want her to clench your arm really hard, get it. But if you're looking to be entertained, don't say I didn't give you nothing by suggesting you NOT buy it, or rent even.",1121731200,,1972,4.559322033898305
2254059,1,B0007Z2556,"The movie was way too slow.  It didn't capture me at all, nor was it scary.  It is always talking about how Watson is scared of the closet, and they were on it too much more than necessary.  I found myself very bored.  The movie finally picks up a bit in the final 10 minutes of the movie.  That ""climax"" was way too ""unclimaxy"".  Ends were not tied well.

Don't waste your time and money.  Not worth it.",1121472000,,404,4.089743589743589
2254060,4,B0007Z2556,"I think the biggest mistake this movie made was emphasizing the ""horror"" during it's marketing.

This is a much better movie if taken in the perspective of a psychlogical journey.  The ""boogeyman"" represents the main character's difficulties with dealing in reality, thus creating the beast and conquering the beast is analogous to ""facing our fears"" .  The boogeyman lives in the closet (the deeper recesses of our psyche) and when it so expands it can no longer be contained in our subconscious and manifests itself into our ""reality"".

Under the assumption his father really didn't leave him, anyone who becomes close to the main character is succumbed by the ""boogeyman""(aka his girlfriend).  Eventually, once the main character faces his fear, he is no longer plagued by this boogeymanian representation.  Although he cannot change reality he is no longer ""haunted"" by it.  I feel this is a very poignant ingredient to everyone's sanity.  By now whoever is reading this maybe questioning mine!

Anyways, just a brief description of one guy's interpretation of this heavily misunderstood film.",1121299200,2,1097,5.222857142857142
2254061,4,B0007Z2556,"Despite the hype and critcism to the negative aspect, I liked this movie. The film industry in the past 30+ years has tried to feed us the fact that we cannot be scared without being force fed buckets of gore. Now in this generation, the public has become desensitized to the whole American horror movie genre. It has been played....and re-played....then replayed again so many times that it has become one genre that has totally lost it's originality. Aside from forays into the bizarre by Clive Barker and horror maven, Wes Craven, there has been little that hasn't been copied or overdone in the horror field. Sad, but true. Now movie execs are trying to aim movies at the voracious appetite of the younger crowd and are soft selling the horror movie to the PG-13 crowd and the ""R"" crowd are hating the lack of limbs (severed, that is) in these movies. If you go into this new found soft-core horror (so to speak) with lower expectations and an open mind, some of it can just be fun. That is what I liked about ""Boogeyman"". There is little here that cannot be viewed on late night TV without being hacked to death, no pun intended. Aside from the sometimes annoying amplified noises, there are no true horrifying scares, but if you get into the story there is a moral of a man confronting his childhood fears and triumphing and some genuine atmosheric chills. The hero, Tim, played effectively by 7th Heaven's Barry Watson is tramatised as a youth after seeing the much feared ""Boogeyman"" violently attack his father and pull him into the fabled closet, never to be seen again. At 23, having premonitions of his mother's death, prompts him to return to his childhood home and fears to confront and finally overcome the ""Boogeyman"". Although when the Boogeyman finally appears, the animatics are a bit weak, but I overlooked this because it was aimed at a younger crowd. Setting aside the obvious flaws, I found the underlying story of a man conquering his fears to be a nice escape from impaled and severed body parts and not a bad trip afterall. If you are looking for a thriller, this is a finely crafted, yet somewhat predictable story, capably acted by Watson. It's a fine, old fashioned type ghost story. If you are a gore hound, this is not for you.",1121212800,7,2258,4.633416458852868

Boring!  Second, there is nothing scary about this film, only jumping!  There is no gore, no zombie, no ghost, and no horror.  Well at least I find the end very amusing and comical.  Overall, don't bother renting this one, wait for the movie to come on tv, and watch it when there is nothing on to watch.",1121126400,,515,4.554347826086956
2254063,2,B0007Z2556,"Well, i must say i did glance at the clock a few times. It wasn't one of those movies where you enjoy it so much it's over before you know it. No surprise that this movie was not scary, just a few startling noises, sound effects, whispers, and creaks in the stairs, but nothing really made sense. The end was kind of retarded, the shots were too quick you can't really see what's going on and if you did get a glimpse here and there it didn't make sense. The boogeyman looked like the mummy in THE MUMMY. lol. But barry watson is hot and a decent actor. He was just in a bad movie. I've seen worse, but this is just another horror that failed. I noticed alot of ideas were borrowed from other movies, nothing original here sorry. And i agree that at the beginning when the dad is thrown all around the room by the closet monster and all bloody and then gone forever, the kid just sat there, with a little look of surprise. Not very realistic or believable. Screaming, running out of the room, crying, would have made it a better beginning. What a dumb idea. Before writing a story about fear, maybe these writers need a lesson on human reactions, especially when it comes to children. But anyway, this movie wasn't horrible, it was just lacking everything a successful horror movie needs. I think if i saw it in theatre's i wouldnt be too bored but it's not one i'd ever want to see a second time. Maybe it was barry's good looks that kept me watching who knows. But as far as creativity, intelligence, and originality, nope. One very important failure is the boogeyman's look, very uncreative. I would have had fun with it. I mean just think he's suppose to be a scary blood thirsty closet monster, they couldn't come up with something better than a bald mummy look alike. Very bad special effects.

All in all, I was disappointed. The cast was fine. Even with his one expression, Barry Watson is certainly handsome enough to keep you watching. The acting is generally OK for this kind of film, and there's a particularly good perfomance from young Skye McCole Bartusiak.  I love this genre, and almost bought it. Then a friend loaned it to me, and saved me a few bucks. After buying ""Darkness"" and ""White Noise"", sight unseen (both of which disappointed me), I'm glad to know I made the right choice. When do you think we'll get a really good ghost movie? ""The Others"" was the last decent one I can remember.",1120867200,,774,4.48936170212766
2254066,1,B0007Z2556,"From the very beginning, I was convinced that Boogyman was another horror flick failure.  Let's first look at the acting.  I know the little boy who sees the boogyman literally suck his father into no-man's-land is only really in the movie about the first 5 or 10 minutes, but let's get real - if you saw your father being zapped away from you before your very eyes by a monster living in your closet, wouldn't that absolutely terrify you?  Wouldn't it make you sad?  Wouldn't you be tempted to run out of the room screaming for Mommy the whole time?  That's what I thought.  The boy showed no terror - an expression of mild surprise is all I'll give him.  I often wonder why the director of a movie such as this doesn't think on my level about such things.

Anyway, the rest of the movie basically follows suit.  The characters sucked.  I felt no sympathy for them whatsoever.  The plot of the movie made no since - how come no one made a bigger deal about all the missing kids?  Why was the boogyman only terrorizing certain kids - mainly Barry Watson's character?  Did his mother think that her husband just left her and her son, or was she home to hear all of the racket in her little boy's room the night of her husband's ""abduction""?  What was with that boarded up shack near the home he grew up in that the main character went to explore towards the end of the movie?  What was the connection there?  Why did he transport from the hotel room in which he and his girlfriend were staying to his boyhood house??

So, the boogyman was defeated in the end by the main character simply staring him down?  How weak.  Looks like the writer, director or whomever ran out of ideas.  This movie really lacks originality in the worst way.  Don't waste your time or money for the few little scares (mostly due to sound) that this movie has to offer.",1120867200,2,1843,4.377581120943953

The directing is SO BAD in this movie that in the final battle with Boogeyman the camera is all over the place and I haven't got the slightest clue as to what was happening. All the sudden the movie was over. No explanation as to how this guy defeats the Boogeyman or how he knew how to defeat him. And the Boogeyman looks terrible too.

2254071,4,B0007Z2556,"I'll admit that during the first ten minutes or so of ""Boogeyman"" I thought I was in for a disappointment.  Everything seemed to be just a copy of scenes from the beginnings of ""They"" and ""Darkness Falls"" but shortly after the familiar opening, things start to branch out until the movie is treading its own path.  The basic premise is familiar but classic, the kind of thing that can work a lot more than once if it's done well: a man (Barry Watson) returns to his now deserted childhood home to try to put his mind to rest once and for all whether the frightful, ghostly things he saw there as a child were real or imaginary.  Along the way, he reconnects with his childhood sweetheart (Emily Deschanel, who gives arguably the best performance in the movie, although child actress Skye McCole Bartusiak gives a standout showing too) who he doesn't really want to be attracted to because he has a girlfriend back in the city (Tory Mussett).

  I liken this movie to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that I don't think it showed even a small fraction of the total story, that perhaps there's something beyond comprehension here.  It's been complained that the Boogeyman, when revealed, seemed too generic.  I don't believe we - or the characters in the movie - saw the true form of this being.  I believe that what the characters saw was the form he decided to let them see - after a mindwarping and seemingly time-bending ride of terror.  There are a couple of other points I'd like to make, and I'm going to avoid specifics where possible - and this is just my interpretation anyway - but I'm going to put it down below.

  WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD

  A lot of people say this movie makes no sense.  One of the reasons for that, I would imagine, is the relatively easy (after initially seeming unbeatable) and quite convenient way the Boogeyman is defeated at the end.  I agree it was too easy.  Far too easy, far too convenient, and I think that's what was brilliant because I think it's exactly the way this entity, this Boogeyman, planned for it to all go down.  I'm not just making excuses because I liked the movie and want to explain away a bad ending, but the only way it makes sense is if that's the way he wanted it.  I think it was all some elaborate lure/game that this Boogeyman or whatever his/its real name is set up as a means of increasing his own power even further.  And I think he needed this particular person (Watson's character) to, for whatever reason, use that particular item, for this play to work.  If this is true, his victims are more than his victims - they are(at least some of them) pawns on a chess board.

I personally want there to be a sequel to this, although if I'm on the right track here it would be dangerous to try,because it would be easy to blow it big time if they actualy try and show what's behind the facade and the games.  But if done right, it could be one of the greatest movies ever.  It may be that it can't be explained.  Some of the most effective horrors are those that, like the first Blair Witch and certain of H.P. Lovecraft's stories, suggest that the 'explanation' behind a series of events may be so alien to anything we've ever experienced or imagined that we could never grasp it.  Maybe that's why the Boogeyman tends to haunt children, because being more open-minded and innocent, they're the closest anyone could ever get to understanding what he is, and that's a secret he doesn't want out there.  Maybe this is a Boogeyman who's responsible for a lot more than we'd ever know, and the only rumors of hs or its existance are from when he's manifested to pursue potential threats to his reign.  Those last couple of thoughts are pure conjecture, but the rest of it, I really belive was the point of the movie.  And I don't know if anything's going to be able to stop him for real if there is a sequel, but I think Franny Roberts (Bartusiak's character) may have at least part of the key, whether she knows it or not.

Deep, scary stuff.",1120694400,,4014,4.463648834019204
2254072,2,B0007Z2556,"Boogeyman opens with a young boy up in his room.  He's terrified of something in the dark.  He dives under his covers to hide only to see a menacing figured hovering over him, it's then that a parent comes into the room to assure him that everything is ok..until the parent is attacked and killed by the apparition.  Now cut ahead 15 years, the boy is now a young man in his early 20's and terrified of the dark, particularly dark places with doors like closets.  Sound familiar?  Maybe because it's basically the same opening as the also bad (but better than this) horror film of a few years ago called Darkness Falls.  That film dealt with one childhood myth of the toothfairy while Boogeyman deals with...uhhh...the boogeyman.

Barry Watson plays Tim, now grown up and possessed by this unnatural fear.  Upon learning of his mother's death he decides to return home and spend a night in the house of his youth and where his father was taken.  Most assume that Tim is just a bit deranged and they're a bit right as he regularly freaks out when when he finds himself trapped in tight quarters.  He creeps around the old house hearing the sounds of various doors creeking open or closed as the director opts for the usual, cheap jump in your seat moments as things go dashing by the doorway, just out of sight.

We learn that as a child Tim's father locked him in a closet and scared him of tales of the boogeyman in order so he WOULDN'T be afraid.  A psychologist would have a field day with that.  Tim's mom is played by Lucy Lawless in a near cameo role.  No horror movie these days is complete without a creepy little kid and this one is no different as Tim meets a little girl named Franny who hangs around Tim's old house at all hours of the night.  He finds her book bag loaded with pictures of missing kids and soon learns that Franny's father was taken by the Boogeyman...then we learn what anyone with an IQ over 10 already knew...that Franny was a ghost and one of the missing kids, apparently taken by the Boogeyman as well.  One immediately wonders why Franny was able to appear to Tim and not any of the other kids or his father.  That MIGHT have helped!  Tim eventually has to have a showdown in his own room with the spirit and is joined by childhood friend Kate.  When we finally get a good look at the Thing we get a very cheap CGI affect.

Boogeyman is front and center of what is wrong with so many horror films today.  No originality...almost no story whatsover..just a series of startling moments that don't make a story.  What was this boogeyman?  Beats the heck out of me...evidently it did with the writer and director since they offered no explanation of their own.  Darkness Falls was not a great movie but at least it explained its antagonist, however lame it may have been.  Forget this one!",1120694400,,2820,4.439688715953308

2254074,2,B0007Z2556,"I had very high hopes for this film, as I heard BOOGEYMAN marked the return of Tapert and Raimi to the killer thriller film.  Despite these two great filmmakers producing this movie, BOOGEYMAN only delivers a few positives, soaking in a sea of negatives.

Positives:

Barry Watson turns in a great performance.  He makes a meal of the skimpy scraps tossed to him by the script.

Joe's music score is fantastic ...mostly because it reminds all of us horror fans of that long ago breath of fresh air known as THE EVIL DEAD.

The cinematography is wonderful.  Every shot is artistic, gothic, and compelling.  The visuals of BOOGEYMAN really suck you in... too bad that there's not much to keep you there after you've arrived.

The negatives:

Other than Barry Watson, all of the other actors range from slightly flat to embarassingly terrible.

The script would have made a good 20 minute short.  Unfortunately, this feature pads it's run time with useless visual effects sequences, boring subplots about Barry Watson's annoying girlfriend (and even more annoying family) and a supporting character: a little girl who we know from the first moment is a ghost... who is there to provide information ...though she never really does.

In the behind-the-scenes of the DVD, the director, Stephen Kay, sounds like a very smart man.  So I wonder why he made so many bad decisions for this movie.  His worst decision:  Slapping the viewer every two minutes with screeching, annoying, ""startling"" hyper-cut bursts of imagery that mean nothing.  This tactic in modern horror movies did not work when they started overusing it a few years ago... and this tactic has only grown more annoying over the years... culminating to an infuriating peak with BOOGEYMAN.

And the worst thing about BOOGEYMAN:  The bad guy that we are all supposed to be afraid of is a CGI blob.  PLEASE, horror filmmakers.... STOP using CGI to create ""supernatural"" imagery, or bad guys, or whatever.  It looks fake.  It is not scary!

Avoid BOOGEYMAN.",1120348800,,2010,4.916666666666667
2254075,1,B0007Z2556,"I rented Boogeyman thinking that it couldn't possibly be as bad as I'd heard. Unluckily for me, it was. At least half of the running time consists of Barry Watson slowly creeping towards a half-open door. NOT SCARY.

This movie sets up an interesting story, then does almost nothing with it. And the ""surprise twist"" in the film was a surprise only to the 5 year olds in the audience taken to this film by their baby-sitterless parents.

2254079,3,B0007Z2556,"Well I watched two horror movies last night. One was Darkness, and then the other was Boogeyman. Neither was exactly heart- stopping, but alas the Boogeyman was a heck of a lot better. Boogeyman at least you could understand the true essence of the plot a lot more clearly, the actors definitely were better, and the creature at the end of the film did freak me out for a second. I think this movie made it seem like the Boogeyman is universal, just a bad spirit, and forms into what you imagine it to look like which is what this man, the protagonist in the film, did. I won't spoil the movie but the Boogeyman looks like a few things in his room put together. That was an interesting idea. The whole point of this is that it was something different to watch than the occasional house plagued with mad spirits thing they overdo. This movie was different and not too bad in their difference so I give it a solid three stars. Although in some parts of the movie you could feel lost, in the next scene you usually pick the pieces up quickly. The ending was the best part to me when he finally after running around his house so many times faces the creature once and for all. The ending they first chose, the one they stick with at the end is the best one. The other one, the ending they didn't put in the movie but let you see in the menu, was downright ridiculous. Where was his childhood friend in the second ending? And did you see how he looked standing in the window? He looks like a cartoon colored in! He didn't even look realistic. Now maybe that's because they weren't planning to put it in so they just didn't put much effort into it, they just showed a rough sketch of the second ending. I don't know but the second ending I didn't like at all. Trust me, the first ending, the one they show in the movie, is the best.

Overall the movie was all right. I didn't hate it, but I won't be racing to the stores to own it as well. It was good to watch once, but probably never again, unless on t.v. one night when there's nothing else on.",1119744000,,2041,4.219948849104859

Something similar works for art. If it doesn't make any sense, not only has the audience been egregiously deceived, but the film simply doesn't work.

That's what happens here.

The first hour of this film is filled with ""blank"". Nothing. The main character (in an interesting turn from his character on Seventh Heaven - and I LIKE that) looks around a bit, obviously creeped out. With a few very minor exceptions, that's about it. In addition, the minor exceptions don't hold up to the litmus test of: does it make sense. Those exceptions don't make sense, so they're eliminated entirely from the story line.

I'll give the film credit for making an attempt to create something that's almost ""Memento meets horror"". There is some paranormal time shifting going on, but again, we're not given enough information for any of that to make sense. This begs the question: can we make sense of it? The answer is yes, to a certain degree - but only if we throw all reason and logic out the window. Let me compare this to another film, so that perhaps some perspective can be brought into the picture: could we make sense of The Exorcist? You bet we could. That simply isn't going on here. Props for a decent attempt, though.

I'd like to comment on the ending - especially as that's the only truly interesting part of the film, and even that's confusing and a major letdown - but I won't. There really are no surprises, but who knows? Someone might be surprised. Suffice to say that my five-year-old nephew figured out the ending, and to make it worse, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. A ball is smashed, a ""doll"" that we all know never should have existed is smashed, and these things play a part in the ending. Why? I can't for the life of me understand why. Maybe the producers knew, but their knowledge became lost in the story and thought that by not telling us it made the movie stronger. They were wrong, and the box office receipts prove it.",1119484800,8,2161,4.530769230769231

Director Stephen T. Kay tried to salvage the film by using freaky camera angles and slow motion sequences (water dripping from faucet, etc.) to distract the audience away from expecting any kind of a plot.

Boogeyman was like getting on a roller coaster, then finding out that the roller coaster has no hills bigger than ten feet.  But when the riders complain that there were no fun and scary hills, they are told that they were suppose to imagine the hills were there.

The movie starts out with Barry's character watching hid Dad get mangled by the Boogeyman, only we don't know for sure that it really happened.  And the whole rest of the movie is based on not knowing what is really happening.  By the end of the film, I didn't even care what really happened.  It's movies like this that inspire people to write their own screenplays, realizing they could write ""at least"" that good.

This movie isn't scary, interesting, or worth paying to see.  Wait for this one to come to television.

Unfortunately, good storytelling doesn't seem to fall into any of the aforementioned requisites, and it is in criminally short supply in BOOGEYMAN.  Barry Watson, who is  only slightly less charisma-free than former TV sibling  Jessica Biel, plays a man still haunted by...darkness, or something in the dark, or someone in the dark--there is a point somewhere in there, but halfway through this lazy, suspense-free non-thriller, you're going to want to bolt and truly not want  to know the whole point of this waste of filmmaking.  Suffice  it to say, the plot is a slight re-telling of that horror ""classic"" from a few years ago, DARKNESS FALLS, only about ten times less interesting--yes, a scary sheet flying around on a wire hanger was far scarier than anything here.

In spite of some atmospheric creepiness, BOOGEYMAN fails to chill as it intended.  Barry Watson, a rather wooden actor, has the central role of Tim, a young man haunted by memories of his father being sucked into the closet by the boogeyman.  Of course, no one believes him and it is assumed that Tim's pop just up and ran off, leaving behind a drug-addicted mother (briefly played by Lucy Lawless, no Xena here, folks).  Tim's life has never really recovered from this experience, and he is now working for a magazine and has a sweetheart named Jessica.  Upon the death of his mother, Tim returns to the old homestead to pack up her things, and of course to face the boogeyman of his childhood.  Tim meets a strange little girl (played with little life by Skye McCole Bartusiak) and his old childhood playmate (a lovely Emily Deschanel), but the movie never makes any coherent sense as Tim goes in one closet in a motel and comes out in the closet at home, and we get several jarring sequences of doors slamming and opening and a final confrontation with the boogeyman.

At least the movie doesn't rely on gore or sexual distractions, and it does have some spooky moments, but overall, BOOGEYMAN joins films like ALONE IN THE DARK and DARKNESS as inferior horror films of the new millenium.",1119225600,,1417,4.689516129032258

It's a typical age in the film industry and sadly a lot of current films don't speak to its audiences anymore. There was a time when movies were made not to suit what the audience craved for, a time when directors and creative screenwriters wrote stories that would contribute a message to society, rather than thinking about what people might laugh at, shout for, or merely cringe at etc.
  In this case the film Boogeyman tells the tale of a young college student who is deeply scarred since his boyhood after witnessing his father being pulled into the bedroom closet. Now a grown man, he returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral only to encounter the monster of his past again, only this time with the help from his girlfriend is our character able to ""Face his Fears"" once again, and put to an end the horrible Hollywood cliche that has the audience' sighing with relief.

2254093,1,B0007Z2556,"Okay......I really wanted to give this movie a fair chance, because based on the ads, I thought it looked really good. WRONG. First of all, there's a lot of things in it that are really predictable. Like that the guy gets to his house and he has a childhood girl-friend. To me, this made the current girl-friend an obvious target and it was just inevitable. The guy meets a little girl who acts freaky, says she lives in a park and is deathly afraid of the boogeyman. Was I the only one saying, okay, she's obviously a ghost? Next there's the whole weird mystery aspect to all of it. How does the Boogeyman travel, how are all of these doors leading to different buildings, how did the guy get his blood on the bath tub at the end of the movie, was time warping or something? All of these questions seem to remain unanswered at the end of the movie. Okay, at this point even, to me, based on the silhouettes and weird shadows, I thought that at least the boogeyman, when he was shown, would be scary. WRONG AGAIN - - SOME OF THE WORST CG EVER.

But down to one of the things that annoys me most about it. Most of the horror movies in recent years have been following a really annoying trend. They're about some kind of curse or evil,and the evil villain figure is always some kind of product of a curse, or evil, or darkness, or something like that. The movies all use the EXACT SAME KIND OF VISUAL TRICKS. I'm talking about all of these flashings of really quick disturbing images that you can't really make out accompanied by a loud or disturbing noise. I'm talking about movies like The Ring, The Ring 2, The Grudge, Ghost Ship, and .....Boogeyman. Don't get me wrong. I liked The Ring. It was the first one that was a success to really use this technique, in my opinion. All of the villains aren't really ghosts, or undead, or monsters, or killers,they're all like something in-between. But this is a type of horror movie trend that I didn't find to be the scariest kind anyway, and one that has gotten stale EXTREMELY FAST.

Tim's (an effective Barry Watson) fear of dark confined spaces is elevated to the hilt when mortal circumstances force him to return home and spend the night in his abandoned family home. Before you can say seen-this-done-that, our hero is propelled into stylishly executed encounters where bumps-in-the-night and jumping-in-your-seat moments are aplenty.  Yes, this type of nerve cracking moviemaking has been done before, but not as elegantly or as atmospherically distressing as Stephen T. Kay's direction is. His use of every littlest details impresses. From the litter of junk in the shed to the writing on the soiled walls, everything, and anything, is aimed to scare.  As are the digitally-made shadows representing the boogeyman, which add substance to this ballet-choreographed spookiness.  Only when he manifests himself towards the conclusion does BOOGEYMAN disappoint.  His presence ends up looking more computerized than real.  As for the ending, well, let's just say that editing can sometimes hurt a film.  Obviously a better hand at cutting and splicing wouldn't have hurt.

(1) Who hired the 12 year old to write the script. (2) What is the name of the guy who  hired
the 5 year old to edit this film. (3) When did they actually come to the conclusion this was a
story where more than one person agreed they way they filmed it worked. (4) Where was the dir-
ector. (5) Why didn't they just release it straight to Television. I actually wrote this while
watching Boogeyman it was so boring i figured id go ahead and start my own review while it put-
ters on in the background. Im not angry but i certaintly have lost interest heres why:

(1) Sam Raimi needs to stick with ""Spider-Man"". If he really wants to come back into horror he
should be open to re-concpetualizing, and breaking down the way story telling unfolds and can
enfold. (2) This chip chop scenery type of video editing is so annoying, it disjoints any sense
of continuity. This is the worse editing job ive ever seen and its 55 min into the movie. At this
point i have to come to one definitive conclusion and that is that they could not possibly rescue
the movie from here. Not uless someone popped out the TV and Handed me a 100 Dollar bill and
was like ""Suprise"" just kidding! or ""Suprise, your on candid camera! Some people berate all films,
nothing satisfies them. I think this is because they are expecting some life Changing experience
or something. And i understand that illusion... But this film is so flat in storyline is so thin
in plot not to mention the casting :that its like watching a man with every bone broken in his body
try to play it off and walk normal ""anyways"".

looking at it now  would not even care. The pinnacle of this film consists of ""Tim"" the main char-
acter walking around Paranoid and Pregnant with delusions. It's seems to be a lot about shuffling

For one thing, you're never sure whether the hero, played very well by Barry Watson, is dreaming or imagining or whether the events are real. He keeps going into these rooms where he knows the boogeyman is waiting for him but does he even carry a weapon of some kind? Nooooooo. I couldn't tell whether his father was really captured by the boogeyman or whether this was a dream. This movie tries hard to be like ""The Others"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" but doesn't come anywhere close. I was amazed to discover that the director, Stephen Kay, was one of the key forces in the creation of the great ""Evil Dead' movies. What happened, Stevie?",1118016000,,840,4.425806451612903
2254106,2,B0007Z2556,"Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and their Ghost House Pictures seems like it would of been a formidable new presence in the world of horror cinema. So far, it's pretty mediocre. ""The Grudge"" was decentley creepy and entertaining, but if they want to step up to the big leagues and deliver the kind of pictures they said they wanted to make, then they are going to have to keep trying, because this latest one is a step backwards. There are some inklings here and there that this film could of actually of been something. But for me, it seems to close to that incredibly bad and nauseating ""Darkness Falls"" debacle a while back. Both shot in New Zealand with a WB star and a childhood trauma. 7th Heaven's Barry Watson stars as Tim Jenkins, a young man who seems to be having good stuff going for him. A job, and a lovely girlfriend from a wealthy family. But Tim has a dark secret. 15 years earlier, as a young boy, he was scared to death by a story his father told him about the Boogeyman, only to see his father taken away by the thing. 15 years later, Tim is a shattered man frightened by closets, and trying to live down that moment. Pushed by a psyciatrist, Tim returns to the old family home after his mother's death to finally confront his issues and to see if he is really crazy, or if the creature that has hauunted many a kids' closet is real. Helping him along the way is old childhood friend Kate(Emily Deschannel). I won't deny the fact that the movie does have a number of interesting scenes and some genuine chills and spooks, but there are not that many and they are few and far between. Most of the time it's just hot air with ""did something just happen?"" or ""did I just see something"". The movie's running time is pretty short, but it felt much longer. The movie plods along with a lot of time devoted to seeing different parts of the spooky house, and seeing Watson walk along hallways, up stairs, and in rooms investigating. The last half of the film does liven things up a bit, but it doesn't make up for the tedium leading up to it. Watson does a decent enough job playing the hauntedness of the Tim character, with this burden on his back. Others fare less well. Not because Deschannell is bad, but because it's the same old character we've seen a hundred million times. ""Xena"" star Lucy Lawless also pops in as Tim's mother. Director Stephen Kay does have some interesting direction and there are a number of shots that are visually effective. Too bad they weren't in a better movie.  All in all, the idea was good and could of been used to full blown terror and horror. Even tho there are some creepy moments, it plays it safe in it's PG-13 way and ends up being vanilla when it could of been blood red.",1118016000,,2719,4.373517786561265

2254108,2,B0007Z2556,"Barry Watson made Boogyman just before, during, or after he went through treatment for Hodgkin's disease. I commend him for having the bearing to deal with the chemo treatments, etc and being able to work (acting is actually tough work, folks).

However, it is sad that this is the film that he made.

Boogeyman is a sad little film that actually has the potential to scare, but then pulls away from it to give you exactly what is expected rather than delivering chills.

It was not too unlike several other ""horror"" films and yet a very poor immitation of any of them.

The title character looks not unlike a Freddy Kreuger action figure (I guess that's what it's supposed to be) that young Tim has on his nightstand.

There's so much rigamarole that you don't know what or why things are happening and not for good reasons. The filmmakers have borrowed heavily from Butterfly Effect, Poltergeist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the Sixth Sense. Unfortunately, the effect is less than desireable.

After watching a couple of interesting turns whither, the ending is nothing short of disappointing. There's no real resolution. Even the soundtrack sounds unconvinced that the action on screen could reveal the actual conclusion.

It is doubtful that Barry Watson will win any acting awards, but he is not bad - he's just not really good either. And this film depends on him carrying it almost entirely.

2254110,1,B0007Z2556,"""Boogeyman"" is like a lot of recent movies - all style and no substance. Of course, one doesn't expect a lot of substance from a horror movie, but the better ones are based on a working script. ""Boogeyman"" seems to be one of those productions that underwent lots of rewrites during filming.

The movie begins promisingly, even if it is the old `it was a dark and stormy night' motif. A young boy named Tim is too scared to sleep. Laying in his bed, he keeps imagining there is an evil presence in the closet of his bedroom. His father comes in to reassure the boy that there is no such thing as the `boogeyman'. Suddenly, the closet door flies open, and a monstrous thing grabs Dad and pulls him into the closet. Dad is never seen again.

Fifteen years later, Tim [Barry Watson] is a handsome, neurotic young man. Years of therapy have him almost convinced that he imagined his father's disappearance. He decides to return home to house where all his problems began. He discovers the boogeyman is `alive and well' inside his old bedroom closet.

The movie's problem is that there is no attempt to explain anything that is going on. The origin of the boogeyman and why he is in that particular house is not explored. Jumpy camera movements and editing plus loud, `spooky' music substitute for any genuine scares.

""Boogeyman"" is a waste of time and probably wouldn't scare anyone over the age of twelve - unless you are scared of bad moviemaking.",1117929600,5,1445,4.589147286821706

The Boogeyman plays on the unfocused elements of fear, the things we cannot see; however, if you check out the extras, you can see the guy who embodied the figure of ""Tim's"" fear.
The big question is, did Tim make up the monster, or did he have the creature attack him because of ... [ fill in the reason you like].
The absence of a commentary track is a big minus. However, if you get the bonus edition from BEST BUY, you get some great extras that supplement the regular special edition. Hopefully for world release, the disc will be incorporated with the regular disc.
For those noting the similarities to A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET ( first film), the alternate ending will be very enlightening. And whilst I will acknowledge similarities, they are clearly not copies, they take the concepts one step further, especially if you note that Craven himself took the basis for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET from some articles in a Newspaper, and combined that with his own background in the humanities, and (probably) in psychology.
The deleted scenes are very annoying. Would be nice to have a directors cut on this, since there is obviously an alternative version.

Not everyone is going to like this movie, because everyone's view on horror and the Boogeyman is different.

From the beginning the movie was intense and used a lot of the classic loud sounds and the normal horror pranks that have been used over the years to make one's heart race.  The movie turned out to be decent and worth seeing, but it did not live up to its full potential.  The main thing that dragged it down, was the same thing that ruins some of the other movies that are out nowadays.  The Boogeyman was CGI and not very realistic.  The classic horror characters like the original boogeyman ""Freddy Krueger,"" which was a real person in prosthetics and make up, is what made horror movies scary.  The more realistic something is, the better.  Besides that, I recommend that the movie should be atleast watched once.

This was an interesting attempt, but it fell far short of everything it should have been. Why? Because everything this movie relied on was the physical side of fear (things jumping out of nowhere). It started out interestingly enough, seemingly an alright flick. But when it ended, it just hinted that he could travel through time and space without actually explaining anything about it. And when it ended, it left one wanting more. A lot more. So why did I say it was insulting? This movie may as well have come right out and said that the boogeyman can only get you if you're scared. So don't be scared, right? Wrong. Fear is a natural human emotion that one feels when their life is in danger. When we are in severe danger, or even if a threat is present, our old friend terror comes up and tells us, ""Hey, moron - run!!"" This movie said that we shouldn't fear at all. It said that we should ber killed by the boogeyman or be killed by something else.",1117584000,,993,4.426229508196721

2254124,2,B0007Z2556,"Sorry, you can put away those bell bottoms and disco shoes. Boogeyman isn't a sequel to Boogie Nights, or even an homage to K.C. and the Sunshine Band. It's another creep in the closet experiment in terror, and I'm not talking about that night Uncle Arthur hid out in my walk-in sniffing the lining of my sneakers.

Boogeyman is about things that go bump in the night, childhood monsters that hide under the bed, in the shadows, or in the closet. Don't bring the kiddies, because this isn't Monster, Inc., even though everything about Boogeyman feels manufactured.

Director Stephen T. Kay (Get Carter) wraps Boogeyman in a veneer of spooky images, creating an appropriate sense of doom and dread. Kay effectively manipulates light and shadows, slicing the screen into a mind-bending blend of fact and fantasy. Deciphering that reality is young Tim Jensen, whose room becomes a veritable Grimm Fairy Tale when the lights go off.

As a boy, Tim's father was sucked into the closet never to be seen again. Now an adult, Tim (Barry Watson) is still haunted by memories of the Boogeyman. His life is constantly subjected to childhood flashbacks, forcing Tim to confront his past once and for all. When Tim's mother (Lucy Lawless, sans sword) dies, he heads home, using the trip to heal old wounds

With the encouragement of his shrink, Tim decides to spend the night in his old childhood home, hoping to put an end to his nightmares. Instead, Tim is immediately visited by a spirit who informs him he is the only one who can bring down the Boogeyman. Traditional dream warrior crap, served up on a shiny dish that can't disguise the fact that it's still crap.

Boogeyman boasts three writers but doesn't contain one original idea. In order to hide the fact that they have nothing, the writers attempt to engage us in a series of mind games. Closets are used as portals, and if this were a comedy, this device might have been funny. Instead, it feels like a strained attempt to make a purse out of a sow's testicle sack.

The young cast throw around as much weight as their stick figure characters allow, but they're nothing more than props in this stylized fun house that isn't really that much fun. The director and writers toss in the customary shocks, and while they're designed for maximum impact, they buckle under their own logic.

His mom, played by Lucy Lawless (Xeena:WArrior Princess) in a small bit, told him he ran away but little Timmy knows the real truth...he was taking away by the Boogeyman. So, 15 years later, he is still afraid of the thing in the dark. When his mother passes, he decides to go back to the old house he grew up in for the night and face his fears. That's when things start to get a little trippy and when everything starts to get interesting. The direction and visuals are better than usual except for the final fight scene at the end with the Boogeyman...that kinda fueled it down...I withstood what was of the crummy dialouge and some wooden acting but other wise the jump arounds and the other things were what made me like this better then White Noise and Hide and Seek. I didn't rate it 3 stars, more like 2 1/2 for what it was. it wasn't the worst horror movie ever, just a little better then most of the horror (...) they marketed in the past years (House of The Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, Alone In the Dark, Resident Evil 1 and 2...just to name a few)",1111276800,,1200,4.290748898678414
2254146,2,B0007Z2556,"After watching the trailer for Boogeyman, I thought it would be pretty scary, so I decided to check it out. Unfortunately, after watching the first few minutes of the movie, I realized what a bad predicament I had gotten myself into.

The movie is about Tim, who as a child, catches the boogeyman coming out of the closet and suck his dad into the closet. People tell him he just imagined the whole thing and that his dad actually left the family for other reasons, even though he never sees his dad again. Jump to 15 years later, where Tim and his girlfriend Jessica are meeting Jessica's parents. Tim still hasn't gotten over his fear of the closet. During their stay at Jessica's folks place, Tim gets a call from his uncle Mike, telling him that his mother passed away. After the funeral, Tim decides to stay a night in his old house to get a few of his mother's things; little does he realize that there's something still waiting for him, in the house.

While there are a few creepy moments in this movie (for example, the way the monster takes the form of water and gets Jessica in the motel, and the main reason I gave this movie 2 stars), most of the scenes are just loud sound effects that made you jump from your seat, making you feel foolish. Moreover, there are way too many plot holes in this movie, which raises more questions than answers. Why does it decide to come after all these years, just when Tim arrives? Why doesn't Tim realize that the bloody handprint smeared in the bathtub is his, when he visits the motel with Kate? And in the first place, HOW did the Boogeyman even come to being, and why does Tim use the toy soldier in the end?!? While the cast acted pretty good, with the story being so silly, it's hard to take them seriously in the movie.

So, in conclusion, watch this movie only if you have way too much free time on your hands, otherwise, just wait for the DVD to release.",1111104000,,1910,4.374647887323944
2254147,2,B0007Z2556,"So far this year we have seen some mediocre horror movies (Hide and Seek) and some bad horror movies (Alone in the Dark).  Boogeyman, in my opinion, is in the inbetween area between ugh and meh.  Not a very good place to be.

This is yet another pre-teen ""fight fest"" that lacks subtley and true horror and is intent with using ""jump out"" scares that are heightened by a piercing musical cue.  It's a very typical horror movie that is filled with horror movie cliches that were tired back in the 90s.  The hero runs into something, big boom of music to wake up the audience. Hero runs into something else, another big boom of music. I'm just tired of this kind of thrill. It's overdone.

The story reminded me a lot of the set up to Darkness Falls with the Boogeyman replacing the Tooth Fairy. Usually I'm at odds with professional reviewers when they reveiw horror movies. You can usually tell, however, what kind of quality movie is being put out by whether the production company will have an advanced showing before releasing to theatres.  This movie (like Alone in the Dark before it) was not released for pre-reviews.  That is usually an indicator of a special kind of crap fest.

The problem with this movie is that it's just not very scary unless you are or are with a 12 year old and I hate to say it, but a 12 year old female.  It's very telling, though, when at the climax of the film 2 of my female friends and I laughed because we were watching a reject from the Mummy Returns getting attacked by Barry Watson.  What went wrong?

There are times when you feel like they are trying to be smart and trying to move the story above the cliche, but they never fully manage it. I think the best and most startling part of the movie involves the hallucination early on where the main character sees his mother. What disappoints me most about the movie is that they have a rich world to work with. The main character's past is filled with traumatic experiences involving psuedo child abuse. If the movie had strayed closer to this and the main character's past coming back to haunt him instead of the ""real boogeyman"", I think it would have been more successful and ultimately scary.

The trailer was very good and made me very interested in it. It looked like a head trip and I thought it might go down the territory of the boogeyman being a metaphor and not a ""real"" computer generated monster. Horror movies are most successful when they delve into the human psyche and truly examine fear. We never delve into the main character's mind, never truly see the dark past that brought him to where he was. All we ultimately see is a reject from the Mummy Returns. It's sad because I really wanted to like this movie. Especially coming off of The Grudge, I expected a certain something from Sam Raimi's new production company. I got ""something"" alright but it wasn't what I was looking for.

The movie didn't waste our time BUILDING character plot stories that we could care less about. It got down to business real fast. I like that sometimes.  Too many times movies like this get a bad rap.  Im sure no one made this expecting an oscar.  They made it to get back to good old fashion BOOGEYMAN tales.  The kind that use to scare us when we were kids.  I loved it.  Thought the characters were solid with great acting.  The guy from 7th Heaven was wonderful and it ends good for once.  The reason I didn't give it five stars was because the Boogeyman could have used a makeover.  I mean don't get me wrong he looks freaky, but this is the big moment and they way he looks wasn't really what you expect to see.

He knows it was the boogeyman that took him, dragging him into Tim's closet.  People who know him feel that his father just pounded the boogeyman story into his head so much that it was Tim's way of dealing with his father's disappearance.

Now, having returned to his childhood home, he is still dealing with the childhood fear of the boogeyman, and when strange things start to happen in the old house, Tim decides to find out some answers once and for all.  With the help of childhood friend Kate (Deschanel), he looks for the solution to this fear from his childhood.

The best thing I can really say about this movie is that it is a horror movie that works well with its PG-13 rating, unlike recent horror movies.  It completely suits the story, and nothing feels ""removed"" to get the lower rating.  The story is somewhat interesting, but could have been handled better by a more experienced director.  There are some ""jump"" moments, and some non-linear story movement that work about as well as can be expected in a movie of this quality.  The actors are nothing special.  With no big names in the movie, one would at least hope for a surprise stand out performance, but there are none.  This is B-movie all the way, and if that kind of horror movie suits you, then check it out.  If not, then steer clear.",1109894400,,1480,4.5606060606060606

The worst thing about this movie is the extra characters with no possible purpose in this story.  He goes to his girlfriend's home for Thanksgiving weekend, to meet her obnoxious family, only to be grilled relentlessly by her snobbish father and various relatives.  After that excruciating dinner scene, he tries to go to sleep in his assigned room only to have a nightmare of his Mom that propels him out of bed, where his girlfriend discovers him cowering in a corner of the room.  Then he gets a phonecall from his uncle that his mother has died.  So while he had already realized from his nightmare that he needs to go and see his mother, it is too late.

He leaves his girlfriend's home with no explanation (she is very rude and annoying as well.  There are no more glimpses of her family, which is just as well.  That entire family scene was totally unnecessary to the movie.  The actors should never have been hired for such a lame scene in the first place - then they would have had more money in the budget to provide actual answers as to what the Boogeyman was and why he was torturing this young man by taking people he cared about, yet leaving him behind.

The girlfriend shows up unexpectedly at his house the next evening, in the midst of his hullucinations (or are they?) so he grabs her and flees to a motel, where, of course, she is taken by the Boogeyman.  Now, remember, Tom's (our star) blood is left at the scene of her abduction.  While Tom returns to his house through the closet in the bathroom of the motel, his uncle was at the house looking for him because he'd been contacted by the childhood friend who is worried.  Tom cannot free his uncle from the shrinkwrap death the Boogeyman bestowed on him but his fingerprints are all over the plastic.

Get my drift?  There are at least 2 people who have forensic evidence on them (should they ever be found), and at the very least, a mess in the motel bathroom with his DNA all over it.  I would assume her snobbish family would go to great expense to bring their daughter's killer? to justice.

The movie ends with no explanation and no answers to what will happen to Tom once the evidence is sifted through.  It is a terrible movie that was full of cheap special effects and bad acting.  The childhood friend is the only reasonably good character, but given very little to do.

They should have spent more money on fleshing out the Boogeyman and answering a few questions and tying up loose ends so you don't just go ""huh?"" at the end.  Poorly edited and not at all scary.",1109116800,,2801,4.396116504854369

2254164,5,B0007Z2556,"I found ""Boogeyman"" to be an extremely frightening movie.  I saw it three days ago and even now, the thought of it makes my heart stop for a few seconds.

It begins with a young boy, named Tim, who watches helplessly as his father is taken by the boogeyman.  Fifteen years later, Tim is a successful young man with a beautiful girlfriend, but is still haunted by a seemingly unreasonable fear of closets.  (He's been convinced by shrinks over the years that his father left him and his mom and that the boogeyman story was his way of dealing with it as a child.  They never listen to the kids, do they?)

When his mother dies, his psychiatrist recommends staying overnight as his old house to prove that there's nothing in there.  (Famous last words...)  There are a lot of spooky sounds and creepy memories in the next few scenes, but, in my opinion, things really get good when Tim meets a young girl named Franny, who is aparently being bothered by the boogeyman as well.

I won't go into details too much about Franny...that's part of the surprise close to the ending.  People a little more, um, sophisticated than me will probably be able to figure it out before the fact.

The only thing I would have changed about this movie would have been just a little falling action before the ending.  Movies these days tend to end too abrubtly for my liking.  There's all the rising action, than the climax and then....here come the credits.  I need some closure!  Other than that, the movie was perfect.

If you are into lots of violence, gore and slasher-movie type stuff, then this isn't for you.  But, if you, like me, are still scared by old childhood horrors, this movie is right up your alley.

On a personal note, I think the thing I truly liked best about ""Boogeyman"" was that it was able to scare me.  (Most of the movie was viewed from in between my fingers.)  So many people have become so jaded that nothing shocks or appalls anymore.  Being scared to that point where I can't even scream in horror reminds me that I am capable of being scared and that I'm not as in control as my adult mind likes to believe.  I truly hope more movies just as frightening (if not more so) than this come out.",1109030400,5,2201,4.43640897755611

2254166,1,B0007Z2556,"I went to see this movie with low expectations--it had gotten poor reviews, and I didn't even think the trailer looked scary.  And even with those low expectations, this movie was still pretty awful. Here's why:

1)  For one thing, it is NOT suspenseful in the least.  The movie relies heavily on ""jump out at you"" scares (with the shrieking, shrill soundtrack to back it up)--but those scares are so silly that they don't succeed in making you do anything but roll your eyes.  For example, one great scare is when he walks into a closet and is suddenly and inexplicably attacked by clothes hangers (not really, he just has a total freak out and keeps backing up into clothes hangers... over, and over, and over...No really, it lasts about two minutes).

2)  The ""surprises"" are not surprising.  I won't give any spoilers as to who, but some of the people in this movie are already dead. In the world of post ""Sixth Sense"" viewers, it's not hard to figure out who's already bitten the dust right from the minute you meet them.

3)  The story is awfully familiar.... didn't I just watch this a couple of years ago in a movie called ""Darkness Falls""??  A guy who sees a loved one murdered by a supernatural figure and then spends his life getting ridiculed for it?  And then goes home to finally put things to rest and get on with his life?  Been there, done that, and as sad as it sounds, I was more scared in Darkness Falls.... at least that stupid Tooth Fairy scared me a little bit once I saw her!  The boogeyman in this movie looked like a cartoon.

4)  The story is RIDICULOUS.  He walks into a closet and is suddenly in a hotel room!  And he's suddenly in the past!  And then some girl from his childhood appears out of nowhere!  And then he goes into a closet and he's back home!  And then his childhood friend appears again out of nowhere!  And then some silly girl who likes to follow him around shows up, talking all weird and making no sense.  And then his girlfriend shows up out of nowhere and then disappears!  And ..... you get the point.

Hell, if you ask me, Saw should have been made 10 years ago, because it has nothing going for it in the 21st century. Anyways, Boogeyman wasn't just a subpar movie. It's actually one of the better scary movies so far this year, alot better than White Noise, and about even with Hide and Seek. Some parts made me jump unexpectedly, and thats what I liked about it. Finally a movie that can get you involved with it and sometimes make your heart race. The beginning was awesome, I'm not goinna spoil it, but it immediately got my attention. Lets just say, not too long after the opening credits start, we get a little taste of the title character(you guessed it, the Boogeyman), and its not a pretty sight.

This movie actually manages to be less scary and make less sense than ""The Grudge"". The only scary moments in the movie are jump moments and not one of them made me jump, there is no tension or creepy parts in the movie at all. The last half-an-hour of the movie doesn't even make sense by horror standards. The only reason I'm not pissed that I saw it is because I saw it for free.

This is the sound that makes your head hurt; the high decibel, makes-your-ears-bleed, type of sound.  This sound is heavily enmeshed in this movie.  The actual movie is not very scary, but when the music that accompanies each scary moment happens, you will jump straight out of your seat and cup your ears screaming ""Why God, why?""

I think by the end of the movie, every time I anticipated a cheap scare, I cupped my ears because they were tired of being assaulted.  I would be curious to see if this was a movie trick that happened in all the theatres or if I was just the unlucky one.

The sound aside, what we have is a standard horror movie, filled with cliches.  The hero runs into something, big boom of music to wake up the audience.  Hero runs into something else, another big boom.  I'm just tired of this kind of thrill, I guess.  It's overdone.

The story reminded me a lot of the set up to Darkness Falls with the Boogeyman replacing the Tooth Fairy.  Usually I'm at odds with professional reviewers when they reveiw horror movies.  But, in this case, I can see why the production company didn't have many (if any) early showings for critics because this is a movie that critics will (rightly so IMO) tear apart.

Horror movies are most successful when they delve into the human psyche and truly examine fear.  We never delve into the main character's mind, never truly see the dark past that brought him to where he was.  All we ultimately see is a reject from the Mummy Returns.  It's sad because I really wanted to like this movie.  Especially coming off of The Grudge, I expected a certain something from Sam Raimi's new production company.  I got ""something"" alright but it wasn't what I was looking for.",1107734400,3,2823,4.491159135559921
2254184,3,B0007Z2556,"stephen kay may have ""directed"" this movie, but SAM RAIMI's style is allover this film.  quirky camera angles + camera movement.  special effects seem to be above par for this genre.  story is not especially interesting.  acting is low key for such human tragedy and slight paranoid behavior.  all things considered---pacing, effects, movement--not bad for a horror film.  if you analyze plot details you may become disappointed.  just sit back and enjoy one of today masterful directors at work(sam raimi not stephen kay)---if you enjoy his visual style---go back and enjoy his earlier works.  people that know of sam's movies will already know what I am talking about.",1107734400,,670,5.138888888888889
2254185,2,B0007Z2556,"I don't read movie reviews until I've seen the film because the critics reveal too much about the story, that and the fact that I like to form my own opinion.  The previews of this film look great, as is the premise.  Great concept and attention grabbing beginning, but beyond that, I was very disappointed with this film.  Aside from the previews, I was encouraged that this film was from the producers of ""The Grudge"", which in itself was okay, but other than the first 30 minutes, you'll be disappointed with Boogeyman.",1107648000,,522,4.6521739130434785

8054491,5,B0007Z2556,"Boogeyman is essential for the horror junkie. I saw this in 2005 with a friend of mine and we were not impressed. 12 years later I revisit this movie when I got it for 15 cents at a massive going out of business sale. I watched the 2nd one last year which I got at the same sale. Tobin Bell from Saw was in that one and it was really good.

  I went into this one with an open mind. I thought the acting was decent and it delivered what it was supposed to. I liked the ending the best. That was the most important part of the movie. The story was easy to follow and I liked the little girl added to the adult guy's story. There needs to be a child character somehow still involved being the premise of the movie.

  The Boogeyman is a fear all children fear but oddly enough kids love the horror movies where we deal with fear in a safe healthy place. This movie to me is 5 stars coming from a horror junkie. It also will always hold a special place in my heart for remembering my late friend and I as college kids criticizing it for good laughs. Horror movies are not always meant to be great films but they deliver an injection of fear which is not being able to predict what comes next.
