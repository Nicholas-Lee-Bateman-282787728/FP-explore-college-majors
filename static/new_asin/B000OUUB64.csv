8307850,1,B000OUUB64,"Pretty good footage but AWEFUL production value. I'm pretty sure this movie was edited with iMovie. It is raw footage basically with a crossfade here and there. Seriously the worst surf video I have ever seen. I bought this movie because the line up of surfers is great but now all I want is my money back. For the same price, you can get a movie like ""live from the moon"" which is 100% better. DO NOT BUY or even rent. I turned it off after 15min and will not watch it again.",1392768000,,476,4.129032258064516
8307851,5,B000OUUB64,"Just bough this DVD and love it. Music isn't the best, but killer footage and a lot of action. Shows people getting demolished by waves quite a bit if you like that. Awesome reef breaks, minimal talking and maximum surfing!",1339372800,,223,4.6
8307852,5,B000OUUB64,This has a nice mix of travel and excellent surfing. It's almost worth it just to see the 30 second tube ride Cory Lopez got at Puerto Escondido.,1334880000,,145,4.214285714285714
8307853,5,B000OUUB64,"Some of the best wave action I've ever seen. Great music, most notably would be Brandon Bristow.",1176336000,2,96,4.705882352941177
