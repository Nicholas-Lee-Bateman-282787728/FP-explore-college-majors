8203502,4,B000S0GYO8,It is a good documentary and the extra video features were equally good. I am doing research on the cold war and this provided a very different look at it - actually several very different perspectives that I haven't seen before.,1407283200,,229,4.609756097560975
8203503,5,B000S0GYO8,"While dated, 'Building Bombs' puts a face on Savannah River Site and shows many of the problems that are part of the weapons industry.  Worth watching.",1344556800,,151,4.8076923076923075
8203504,4,B000S0GYO8,"This is an informative, but dated expose of the callous disregard for public safety by the Federal government under the guise of ""National Security"".  It documents  the careless dumping of radioactive waste during the years the Savannah River Plant was processing material for hydrogen bombs.  I believe the film was originally released in theaters in 1991.
My only complaint is that it would be nice to see an update on the individuals interviewed in the movie and  the current state of the Plant and surrounding area.",1200355200,4,519,5.0
