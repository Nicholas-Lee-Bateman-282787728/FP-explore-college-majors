1067030,4,6305772347,"Having watched a number of Mike Hammer t.v. shows, I was looking forward to seeing what the author (Mickey Spillane) could bring to his creation. I was not disappointed. I was, in fact, suprised by how well he played Mike  Hammer, and I would definitely recommend this film to fans of all ages. The  only thing that bothered me about the film is the often annoying  soundtrack.  Note: the movie is in widescreen format",954460800,20,418,4.608108108108108

Darren McGavin's tv version in the sixties had to be cleaned up too much to do justice to this character. I'd have to say the same about Stacy Keach's version too. my advice on this one: the books are always better, much better, if at this point a little dated. works of their time for better or worse. start with ""I the Jury"". the series will work for you or it won't. good reading.",1433980800,,626,4.358974358974359

The highlight is a long, violent and realistic fight near the end. Shirley Eaton is the femme fatale and is quite lovely and usually wearing a bikini or lingerie so that's a plus also. Filmed in black and white which fits the modern noir atmosphere well.

His stories in the interview recall a time long ago and a kind of real New York personality that I haven't seen in years. Lloyd Nolan is in the film, which makes it a keeper for me. Although Nolan was born in California, he has a believable New York attitude that comes from the time when New York wasn't the sophisticated city it pretends to be now. There are twists in the film and murders, of course. It isn't as dark as some noir, but it has enough cynicism for noir lovers. And it has the added attraction of seeing a writer become his character. As Shirley Eaton says, there probably was some of Mickey Spillane in Mike Hammer to begin with.",1426291200,,829,4.286624203821656

I found it on sale at Barnes & Noble for $13 on blu ray so I gave it a second look. Besides the film there is a commentary by Spillane expert (and co author) Max Allan Collins, a trailer, and a half hour bonus interview with Spillane and a 10 minute interview with Shirley (Goldfinger gal) Eaton!  I have to say that I'm very pleased to have this... it looks pretty cool in widescreen and black and white , the perfect media for a Spillane flick.  Spillane is not a great actor but he's no embarrassment either.  At the price I paid it is a very solid purchase and if you are a Hammer fan you will need to add this to your collection along with the essential ""Kiss Me Deadly"" and the 50's tv series set starring Darren McGavin. There is also a mixed bag of Stacey Keach Mike Hammer TV shows on DVD... but loads of the best are still MIA. Oh and some trivia, this is the ONLY time a mystery writer ever portrayed his own main character in a movie... Spillane does play Mike Hammer if I failed to mention that.

This is a review of the 2014 BLU RAY of ""The Girl Hunters"" (1963), also released as a 2014 DVD.
Twelve reviews already posted are for earlier VHS and DVD editions WHICH ARE NOW OBSOLETE.
Unlike the earlier DVD release, the new 2014 Blu-Ray/DVD has plenty of extras.

No one would call Mickey Spillane a great actor, but he was great when he played Mike Hammer.
The author and the character are pretty much the same person.
This is a more mature Mike Hammer than we are used to.
He's mellowed quite a bit.
He doesn't actually kill anybody in this movie, but he does nail one guy to the floor (he wants him to stick around).
Wow.

""The Girl Hunters"" is set in New York, but only a few exterior shots were filmed in the city.
Everything else was filmed on a London soundstage.
They did a pretty good job of disguising it
(except one sleazy Manhattan bar appears to be populated with extras from a Basil Rathbone movie).

Special Features:
-- Feature-length commentary track by Max Allan Collins. Well done. Better than most.
-- Original trailer.
-- 30 minute interview with Mickey Spillane. It's copyrighted MMXIV, but Spillane died in MMVI so that's wishful thinking.
The eighty-ish author is remarkably well preserved and entertaining.
-- 10 minute interview with co-star Shirley Eaton. Also well preserved and entertaining. ""The Girl Hunters"" was made one year before her big break in ""Goldfinger"" - she was 007's Golden Girl. Literally.

Watch the two interviews first (no spoilers), and save the commentary track for last.

The Panavision black and white picture is beautiful.
2.35:1
Strange to see the widescreen process used in a black and white film, but it is effective.
Ironically, the opening credits read ""Colorama Features present"" - it was supposed to have been filmed in color, but financing fell short.

The sound is mono and wide-range. Its hard to find a comfortable volume setting for some of the dialogue when Mike Hammer yells his lines and the other characters speak softly.
No subtitles unfortunately.

I now have four of the five films on Blu-Ray or DVD.
The only one I've never seen is the 1953 ""I The Jury"" with Biff Elliot.
Aargh.
I have seen some vintage movie posters for this film and they make the most of 3-D exploitation possibilities.

1955's ""Kiss Me Deadly"" directed by Robert Aldrich is a cult classic.
It has received the full Criterion treatment on Blu-Ray and DVD (avoid the earlier release on an MGM DVD).
Veteran movie weasel Ralph Meeker is a wonderful anti-hero Mike Hammer.
Mickey Spillane is nearly as good.
Robert Bray and Armand Assante not so much
(Robert Bray at least looks like Mike Hammer - Armand Assante doesn't even wear the hat).

-- Almost a Mike Hammer Film:
Before ""The Girl Hunters"", Mickey Spillane played himself in an odd little movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fear/dp/B000BDH6D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fear</a>&nbsp;(1954)
Not a very good film, but it was a dry-run for Mickey Spillane to hone his Mike Hammer -ish acting skills.
Someone is sabotaging lion tamer Clyde Beatty's Circus,
so Clyde Beatty (playing himself) calls in mystery writer Mickey Spillane (playing himself) to solve the mystery.
I was tempted to add this to my Mike Hammer filmography.

Two made-for-TV movies (""Songbird"" and ""A New Leaf"") were created by combining two hour-long episodes each from the 1997-98 series.
They are available separately on DVD, but are redundant.
If you bought the 4 DVD box of the 1997-98 series, you have everything.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S. If you've never read ""I The Jury"", the first Mike Hammer novel from 1947, by all means do so, and do it before you see any of the movie versions.
It has one of the best surprise endings in all of literature.
Lots of mystery novels have surprise endings, but they usually involve some cheating on the part of the author.
""I, The Jury"" has a real shocker of an ending, but it makes total sense.

The only other surprise ending that is it's equal is by Agatha Christie, in ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" (1926).",1410566400,32,7210,5.819563152896486

U.S.A. are a so strange country where an actor can become President and a writer impersonate the character he created, in a movie. Spillane's acting didn't bother me. After all, he was Mike Hammer. Highly recommended.",1322611200,,288,4.8979591836734695
1067808,4,6305772347,"Mike Hammer's ex-partner, still a cop, has a squad unit drag him out of a booze washed gutter so that Hammer can hear a fatally wounded man's last word.  The man will speak only to him, and, to Hammer's surprise, the dying man leads him to believe that Hammer's old flame - Velda - whose disappearance and presumed death lead to a lost weekend that stretched into months - may still be alive.  Velda's fate is tied up with a prominent politician's `accidental' death, a 50-year-old ultra secret European group that dreams of spearheading a worldwide dictatorship, and the mysterious red - as in commie - assassin known as The Dragon.
Okay, he ain't Ralph Meeker or Stacy Keach or any other Hollywood pretty boy who jams a fedora on his bulb and plays tough for the camera.  Mickey Spillane plays the fictional Mike Hammer, the ex-cop he created and rode to worldwide fame starting shortly after the Second World War with the runaway best-seller, I, the Jury.  Spillane's Hammer is a big man, a wide cinderblock in a trenchcoat with a nose broken once for effect and once again for the fun of it.  Unfortunately, Spillane is possessed of a cinderblock's charisma and animal magnetism, as well.  Fortunately, THE GIRL HUNTERS keeps the obligatory love scene short and, if not sweet, at least dialogue-free.  Anyway, whatever they were doing was over quick and when Mike Hammer ain't doing that - and (thankfully) he ain't doing that much in this one - he's talking tough, and like his literary creation, Spillane can talk tough with the best of them.
  There are a couple of notable actors in THE GIRL HUNTERS.  In 1964, the year after THE GIRL HUNTERS was made, Shirley Eaton played the gold-painted corpse in the James Bond movie Goldfinger.  In THE GIRL HUNTERS she plays the widow of a murdered politician and spends most of her time running around in skimpy bikinis that wouldn't seem overly modest forty years later.  Veteran character actor Lloyd Nolan plays federal agent Arthur Rickerby, who has a personal and `unofficial' interest in Hammer's investigation, which amounts to a score to settle with whoever it was who killed the same man that told Hammer that Velda may still be alive.  Beyond pushing the plot forward, Nolan is around to add some professional ballast to the movie and give Hammer a chance to make ha-ha by mangling his last name over and over and over again.  Nolan was a good actor and he adds value to this one, even though his character is peripheral to the main story and only pops in and out of the movie now and then for short scenes with the star.
  I liked THE GIRL HUNTERS.  The transfer print of the 35mm original was in very good shape, and it's presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  This black-and-white film (original distributed in the USA by Colorama Features, no less) had good scale tone, or whatever it is the techies call it when the blacks are deep and rich and the whites shimmer.  I thought the author Spillane would make a terrible actor, but he was a convincing Mike Hammer and more or less carries the story.  For the first 85-minutes or so the violence is there but relatively tame - the last ten minutes or so contain a couple of discreetly edited gruesome sequences.  High recommendation for this one, if you can find it.",1119484800,15,3285,4.658578856152513
1067809,3,6305772347,"It's funny how Mike Hammer, gritty gumshoe from the streets of New York, always seems to get involved in white-hot cases involving the most sensitive and clandestine areas of international politics. So one has to smile when this happens yet again in ""The Girl Hunters."" But that's the fun thing about Mike Hammer stories: you know what you're gonna get and you always get it. Other Hammer staples this movie serves up with enthusiasm include tough talk, a fistfight or two, a most-likely untrustworthy female protagonist, and a brutal, memorable ending. To quibble a bit, I would have liked to see Hammer's longtime secretary Velda actually appear, as her unknown whereabouts and mysterious past are major motivations for Hammer moving through the complicated plot. Also, the weird trumpet music we hear when Hammer is on the prowl searching for clues sounds more like a funeral dirge for a fallen mafioso than a private eye theme. But, hey, the movie is generally pretty good, and non-actor Spillane actually holds his own with the dazzling Shirley Eaton and old pro Lloyd Nolan. However, all but die-hard Hammer fans will probably prefer to rent rather than buy this item, as there are zero extras on the DVD. You get the movie and that's it.",999043200,7,1244,4.900473933649289

1067811,3,6305772347,"""The Girl Hunters"" is considered to be by many the second best  screen adaptation of a Mike Hammer detective novel (""Kiss Me  Deadly"" being the first). In this one the author, Mickey Spillane,  plays the role of Hammer. He's somewhat wooden in the part and his voice  does not lend itself to film acting (it's raspy), but he is passable as  Hammer. The film itself is B-grade but it is a good, gritty one. Shirley  Eaton, from ""Goldfinger"", plays the female lead quite well.
The  story moves at a quick pace and several scenes stick in the mind. One takes  place in a bar where Hammer convinces a bad guy that it in his best  interest to swallow a bullet. A second is an ultra-violent confrontation  between Hammer and the villian that is better than the fight between  Connery and Shaw in ""From Russia with Love"" (Hammer finds a  unique method for getting the defeated villian to stay put for the police  that is extrememly violent for the time the film was produced). Also,  Hammer's advice on how to properly care for shotgun lingers at the film's  fade-out.
The widescreen version is very well done. The black and white  print is crisp.",965865600,24,1140,4.569306930693069

7894073,2,6305772347,"In the literary world, the Mike Hammer books have always been considered disreputable, unlike those involving Sam Spade or Philip Marlow so it's probably appropriate that the Mike Hammer adaptations that have made it to the big and small screen have been such a mixed bag.  On the one hand, Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly from 1955 is considered one of the best films of its kind ever made and was an acknowledged influence on some of the directors of the French new wave.  On the other hand, My Gun Is Quick made just two years later is a bore that is pretty much completely forgotten.  The only other good Mike Hammer adaptation that I've seen was 1982's criminally underrated I, the Jury scripted by cult filmmaker Larry Cohen who hoped to jumpstart a new series of Mike Hammer theatrical films.  I, the Jury was fast paced, sexy, violent fun that almost perfectly captured the sleazy pulp appeal of Mickey Spillane's books, even if star Armand Assante was perhaps a little too handsome to be playing Mike Hammer.  Unfortunately, most people probably know the character from the dreadful TV series starring Stacy Keach which was campy garbage.

The Girl Hunters from 1963 falls pretty squarely in the lousy adaptation category.  The script and direction actually aren't bad, but someone came up with the gimmick of using author Mickey Spillane to portray his own creation, Mike Hammer.  While Mickey Spillane looks the part just fine he can't act a lick, and it's impossible to get past the fact that his lead performance is so stiff and unprofessional--especially when compared with those of his more seasoned co-stars.  It may be surprising to somebody watching The Girl Hunters but this isn't Mickey Spillane's first big screen acting gig--nine years earlier he co-starred in a B-movie called Ring of Fear along with then very popular but now completely forgotten celebrity animal trainer Clyde Beatty.  I have never seen that film so I don't know whether Mickey Spillane was any more effective there.  The only other acting gig I'm aware of for Mickey Spillane was an early episode of Columbo, but he played a barely fictionalized version of himself and since he was the murder victim he was only in a couple of early scenes before being knocked off.

Mickey Spillane offers very stiff line readings, doesn't seem capable of expressing even a single human emotion plausibly and pretty much makes 1970's porn star actors look like Lawrence Olivier by comparison.  It's hard to fathom why the producers and director didn't realize Mickey Spillane couldn't act early in the shoot and replaced him.  The only explanation I can come up with is that the producers were more interested in the gimmick of Mickey Spillane playing Mike Hammer than in actually making a good movie.

The plot involves Mike Hammer at an all time low, a beat up drunk lying in the streets who is picked up by the police.  You might expect that Mike Hammer's condition at the beginning of the film would have something to do with the plot and that the movie would be told in flashbacks, but that isn't the case.  The police want Mike Hammer because a man was shot and is on the verge of dying in the hospital.  Ballistics surprisingly show that bullet he was plugged with came from the same gun that killed a senator in a case that has remained unsolved.  Police figure that if the dying man identifies who shot him that will lead to the senator's killer, but the dying man will only talk to Mike Hammer.

Surprisingly, Mike Hammer has never seen the dying man before in his life.  Not surprisingly, the dying man provides cryptic information rather than the specific identity of the shooter, but part of that information involves a woman whom Mike Hammer thought long dead so he sobers up and starts his own investigation into the man's murder and the strange circumstances surrounding the senator's death, which was written off as a burglary gone bad but appears to be something else altogether.

The plot in The Girl Hunters is a little hard to follow, but coherent plotting was never really Mickey Spillane's strong point.  His books were about hard-boiled action, hard-boiled attitude, sex, and violence--which is something 1982's I the Jury got right better than any other Mike Hammer adaptation including even the much more highly regarded Kiss Me Deadly.  Still, the plot is diverting enough to maintain viewer interest even if you don't always know exactly what's going on.

Fans of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer character, however many are actually left (Mickey Spillane never came back into fashion like another writer of disreputable crime fiction, Jim Thompson) will undoubtedly want to see this one.  Hardcore fans of private eye films will also likely find this diverting enough.  But if you don't fall into either of those two categories then The Girl Hunters is probably not worth sitting through.  It's ultimately more of a curiosity than a worthwhile film.",1495756800,,4952,4.8700834326579265

7894076,5,6305772347,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE STANDARD DVD EDITION OF ""THE GIRL HUNTERS"" ISSUED BY KINO-LORBER IN 2014 -- not the Blu-Ray version.

I had no idea that this edition of THE GIRL HUNTERS was out until I spotted it on Amazon -- I already owned the old Image Entertainment/Castle Hill edition of the movie on DVD from 17 years ago or whenever, but the extras here attracted me, and I ended up getting it from a rival site (sorry, but the price was right). And I'm not disappointed in most respects by what's here. I've always liked the movie itself, even when i saw it panned-and-scanned full-screen on broadcast television in the 1970s and early 1980s.

The directing is spare and unpretentious, and the low budget -- Spillane reportedly had to raise some money personally to get the financing fully in place, when the existing financing proved inadequate -- works in its favor. One gets the feeling that a lot of first takes (or, at most, second takes) were used throughout, which gives the whole feel of the picture a naturalistic, rough-hewn quality, in keeping with Spillane's writing and his hero's sensibilities. What's more, there's an almost other-worldly, haunted quality to the picture throughout, which is in keeping with the Mike Hammer character's nature in this story, of a suddenly recovered alcoholic, his resurrection brought about by a shock that he spends the entire movie trying to deal with -- that the woman, the one woman that he ever really loved (or, perhaps, came as close to loving as a man like him could ever ger) is not dead, as he's assumed for seven years, but may be alive, but in terrible danger. The picture is half-dream like, with a wafting air of unreality, and half nightmare, when the brutality of the story punches through, which is does much of the time, straddling two moods, worlds, and frames-of-mind.

 And the financing problems with the picture resulted in its being made in anamorphic (that is, true wide-screen) black-and-white rather than color, which is another saving grace -- I can't, for the life of me, imagine how this picture could have worked a quarter as well as it does here, if it had been in color. Philip Green's haunting, trumpet-dominated score, broken up by some powerful string passages and lots of reverb (which seems almost prematurely to be mimicking the work of John Barry in the Bond movies, though perhaps Barry was influenced by Green -- who knows?) adds another layer of impact. And, finally, there are the performances -- Spillane makes a great Mike Hammer, and lives up to the character's name and attributes. and he is matched by the near-perfect cast. New York columnist Hy Gardner may be the only weak link, playing himself in a stiff performance -- but that's par for the course (look at British journalist Arthur Christiansen's appearance as himself in THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE, made that same year) -- everything else is spare and realistic, and even though the picture was shot in England, you'd hardly know it from the voices of the bit players and extras. And Lloyd Nolan, as a veteran American counter-espionage agent, is a joy to watch in every scene he's in; one only wishes there were a tiny bit more of him in the movie than there is.

The Kino-Lorber DVD is an improvement over the Image disc, with much sharper definition throughout. The letterboxing (2.35-to-1) is pretty much the same, near as I could tell. Visually this picture is a delight, with odd camera angles all over the place and effective quick cutting which make it bracing to watch. I sometimes have to think that the people who don't like this movie are allowing their feeling about the Hammer character and the politics represented in the plot spill over onto their appreciation of the movie's attributes. The chaptering is generous, and then there are the extras, featuring interviews with Spillane himself and female lead Shirley Eaton, plus a commentary track by Max Allan Collins, who knows more about Mickey Spillane's work, and about Mike Hammer, and about film noir, that anyone else on the planet. The two interviews are a treat, as both Spillane and Eaton are pretty free-wheeling in their chat, Spillane especially, who -- at this late stage in his life -- seems to love performing for the camera one more time; and he reveals some aspects of how certain incidents and plot devices ended up on the movie (some of it was too close to real-life for comfort), as well as recalling the people he knew in Hollywood (which included John Wayne and screenwriter James Edward Grant). In short, the whole release is a bargain.

My one and only complaint -- and it seems to be a problem with the surviving film source itself, rather than anything the producers of the DVD did or didn't do -- is the sound. The levels are very low, and some of the dialogue, especially in the early reels, seems as though it's coming through a tiny transistor radio, rather than off the soundtrack proper. I did have to boost my monitor's volume up by 50% to get it to an acceptable level. But this was an issue with the Image disc, as well, and may be insoluble. It's still a great DVD, and essential viewing for fans of the author or the genre.",1491004800,,5187,4.713340683572216

7894078,5,6305772347,"Of all the actors who have portrayed Mike Hammer, Micky Spillane IMO captured Hammer the best. Of all Mike Hammer films, TV show etc., ""The Girl Hunters"" was the truest to the novel -  which I particularly value. During the ""special feature"" interview with Spillane about the film he was put out that the movie studio wouldn't spend the money to do it in color, but I think black and white gave the film the perfect ""noir"" atmosphere. The supporting cast was well chosen and certainly helped bring the novel to life. Veteran actor Loyd Nolan did a solid turn as a ""government"" i.e. CIA agent, and of course Shirly Eaton (soon after to be famous for ""Goldfinger"") was as beautiful as she is talented as the ""Femme fatale"". Finally there is an old time newspaperman named Hy Gardner who plays himself. From the perspective of the early 21st century it is pleasantly nostalgic to hear a member of the main stream media (from an earlier time) talking to Hammer about someone who ""...hates the commie punks as much as we do."" However this is Mickey's movie. He would be the first to say he wasn't an actor, but I say it's too bad he didn't play his famous character many times more.",1475884800,,1177,4.525821596244131
