3618941,5,B001GR2ZCM,this was a nice surprise. My teenager loved it .Came in a nice case with both movies. Movies are wonderful to watch.,1231632000,2,116,4.318181818181818
3618942,5,B001GR2ZCM,My friend's daughter love it!  I gave her the set for Christmas and she was so excited that she was showing it off to the neighbors.,1231286400,,132,4.076923076923077
3618943,4,B001GR2ZCM,"I don't fall under the demographic for these movies (I am male in my20s), but I am greatly surprised at these movies. The acting was really great, which is great because I was expecting annoying teenager girls (no offense).

This set comes with both movies presented in widescreen format. The discs are in thindiscs cases, which makes it kinda annoying for people who want to not keep them in this collector box. Also included is the first book that inspired the movies (sorry, I haven't read it.)

Let it be known that this movie can entertain viewers of all demographics.",1230076800,,573,4.72
3618944,5,B001GR2ZCM,"These two movies are very well done, and the price was very reasonable.  This is a good buy for anyone who likes these movies and/or the book series.",1229817600,,149,4.321428571428571
3618945,4,B001GR2ZCM,"I was slightly disappointed that the movies were in thin DVD cases, making it harder to carry them seperately without much risk of harm, but the movies were amazing, as is the book-- I would definitely recommend this if you want both movies. Still include the bonus features, and the case is gorgeous--the pants embroidery is raised so you can run your fingers over it and feel the pictures!",1229472000,14,391,4.681159420289855
3618946,5,B001GR2ZCM,"It took me a couple of years to finally watch these movies, I was kind of put off by the title, it sounded silly. I ordered them from Netfix and just loved them. I order these movies for my daughter in law for Christmas. I know she will love them too.",1229040000,,251,3.9411764705882355

3618948,5,B001GR2ZCM,"These girls show what friendship goals should be. I fell in love with the Sisterhood when I read the novels, but I love seeing my favorite characters brought to life. While the two films aren't exactly like the novels, I still really love them, and they inspire me to keep my friends close. They are great movies to watch with your girlfriends or when you need a pick me up.",1514764800,,374,4.357142857142857

3618953,5,B001GR2ZCM,"SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS Part One and Part Two is an integrated group of stories and narratives, where Part One occurs earlier in time and Part Two occurs later in time, with the same ensemble group of characters.  The flow of the movie transitions from one of the four characters and then to another and to another, analogous to a football in a football game being passed from one player to another.  A better analogy is the movie BABEL starring Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, where the three different plots are similtaneously occurring in three different locations (Morocco, Japan, Mexico) and where the three plots develop independently and on their own but are still related in a way.

RELATIONSHIPS.  What SISTERHOOD is about is relationships, and both movies together cover a huge amount of territory.  The territory that is covered includes: (1) Romance (mostly this); (2) Career development; (3) Deception and sabotage; (4) Multi-generation family feuds; (5) Fatal illnesses and grief; (6) Love that is deep, abiding, and eternal; (7) Discomfort when it appears that a relationship has failed or seems to have failed; and (8) Divorce.

FAVORITE PART.  Each person will have their own favorite subplot from Part One and Part Two.  My favorite subplot occurs in Part Two, and this is when America Ferrera is called upon to read the part for PERDITA in Shakespeare's WINTER'S TALE.  For her initial read, she is so astoundingly perfect that one of the acting teachers tells her not to attend acting school, because it will ruin her.  But several minutes later in the plot, America Ferrera's developing love interest with another theater student seems to have collapsed, and America Ferrera feels betrayed, and at the next rehearsal for WINTER'S TALE, her reading of the part is poor and the acting teacher tells her that is seems she is at the dentist getting her teeth pulled.  But later on in the same movie, America Ferrera's outside love relationship is back on track, and when it comes time to perform the play, she plays her part with absolute perfection.

EYE CANDY.  The locations of Part One and Part Two include Santorini in Greece.  The architecture of the homes, street scenes, and coastline of Santorini (a real place) are all a treat to the eye.  Other locations are an archeological excavation site in Turkey, a department store for lower social class people called ""Wallman's,"" summer soccer camp in Mexico, a playhouse theater at a college in Vermont, and various locations where amateur video-camera interviews are being ""filmed.""  Amber Tamblyn is a beauty to be sure (if you ignore her pot belly) and many Americans admire her father, Russ Tamblyn.  I especially admire Russ Tamblyn for his role in WONDERFUL WORLD OF THE BROTHERS GRIMM, and it is nice to see that his daughter has become an excellent actor.  Alexis Bledel is also a beauty, and she resembles Keira Knightly, except that Alexis Bledel is not so emaciated.  Rachel Nichols (a natural blonde) is a dazzling beauty, and her character tries to sabotage America Ferrera's acting career.  Lucy Hale is the best kind of eye candy, and she has a small part as the sister of Alexis Bledel.  Lucy Hale looks like Selena Gomez (why am I chit-chatting about movie actors like this???).  Also, for female viewers, females might consider actor Jesse Williams to be eye candy.

EXCELLENT ACTING.  As stated above all of the acting is first-rate.  There do not exist any weak moments in either Part One or in Part Two.  There is no phony exaggerations in any of the acting.  None of the acting is crippled with odd mannerisms.  The two actors that I hate the most are Robert Downey and Anne Hathaway.  Robert Downey often acts with an odd, artificial personna where he talks aggressively and nervously.  Mr. Downey's preferred acting style is annoying.  Anne Hathaway frequently makes excessive use of vocal fry.  Anne Hathaway's vocal fry is used so excessive and annoyingly, that even thinking the name ""Anne Hathaway"" causes me to cringe (not to mention her stupid-looking mouth that is permanently fixed into the shape of the Batman character, The Joker).  Fortunately, Robert Downey and Anne Hathaway are nowhere to be seen in SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS.",1502064000,,4251,4.94225352112676

Their experiences are very realistic and the movies are focusing on how the girls are dealing with their challenges by being there for each other, rather than adding more drama for excitement.

3619050,5,B001GR2ZCM,"These two movies are what female friendships are all about--being there fir each other, straight talk when needed and lots and lots of laughs.  The magic of the pants, implausible though it may be, binds the young women together and creates an unbreakable tie that gives them solace and support as they grow, make mistakes and change.  Great movies to watch with teen daughters.",1356652800,2,378,4.890625

3619052,5,B001GR2ZCM,"I really enjoyed both of these movies and now it is great to have them together in one package as part of my collection.  The titles may throw people off, thinking that it is meant only for a younger audience, but the stories are actually quite touching and the film is well made, on location on the east coast, Turkey and Greece. I recommend Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 1& 2 set.",1336003200,2,386,4.361111111111111
3619053,5,B001GR2ZCM,"The absolutely fantastic Greek Scenery I saw in TPs2, brought me to look at getting TPs1. To bad it's not available in Blu-ray. Mind you, it's great in SD, but would be just so much better in Blu-ray. Loved TPs 1 and 2. Gives us men an inside look at the other side of the coin. Considered chick flicks, but I enjoyed them to!",1331078400,2,326,4.109375
3619054,4,B001GR2ZCM,"As someone who owned 1&2 on their own first releases as well as the book, I bought this purely to upgrade to a fancier case. The special features are all the same, nothing new. My only complaint is that the summary on the back is a piece of paper stuck to the back of the box with the same glue they use to send you credit cards in the mail. For whatever reason the glue had soaked through the paper & made it have an unattractive brown line down the middle of  the paper. Besides the glue stained paper, it doesn't make sense to have it on the outside because it will get torn up whenever I put it on the shelf with other movies. It doesn't fit in the box, either. Beyond that you have a very attractive box.
 Should you buy it? It would probably be cheaper to buy the separate releases. It's not as though it comes with all the extra features you'd get if this were Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.",1323993600,3,899,4.073446327683616

3619056,5,B001GR2ZCM,"I think both of these movies portray a great story about friendship and family values. Both of these movies, as well as the books, do a great job giving us an insight of the issues many young women face on a daily basis. I would recommend showing this movie to any young person, both young men and young women.",1315440000,12,310,4.271186440677966
3619057,4,B001GR2ZCM,Enjoyed the movies but they tried to cram too much into one movie.  The second movie summed up three books.  Still enjoyed the movies but as usual the book was better!,1313798400,2,167,4.354838709677419

I love the book series after I saw the movie. It's such a touching story and it made me cry hella bad. My only advice is just grab a box of tissues when you're watching this;-P Oh yeah, and the movies come in a very thin case with a paperback novel of the first book in it.",1273622400,5,408,3.9156626506024095

3619063,5,B001GR2ZCM,"I thought this movie would be corny when it first came out but my sister rented it and I thought it was great! It is corny, but each of the girls is cool in their own way. Carmen is my favorite, she's happy to visit her father but feels neglected when she finds out he's marrying into a new family that she doesn't fit in with. She calls her mom and complains ""the water in the toilet is blue!"" Tibby acts a little stuck up but befriends a younger girl with a terminal illness. Lena is sort of a neutral introvert but opens up a little to a guy she falls in love with. Bridget is athletic and competitive and also finds a guy.... If you like things that are sweet and sentimental you'll probably love it. And the second movie too.

*the only thing special about this special edition is the pretty box and a copy of the first book - if you already own the book and the movies individually there's not much point in buying this...*",1270598400,2,929,4.189944134078212

3619066,5,B001GR2ZCM,"I saw this movie at a dvd rental store and decided to rent both dvds and was honestly surprised that it turned out to be so good! I was not expecting to be blown away by it, but that's exactly how I describe it now. I loved how the parts just fit together in the movie, each girl's story was very beautifully captured in the movie. This movie isn't your typical chick flick either, it has the heartwarming, tear jerky moments too, but I think guys would enjoy watching this just as much! And I just got my special edition set and was very pleasantly surprised that it included the book as well!! Thanks amazon for the great deal too! =)",1239235200,,636,4.264462809917355
