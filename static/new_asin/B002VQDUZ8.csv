8382358,5,B002VQDUZ8,Very fine dvd of Tina cooking delicious regional foods outside in the beautiful countryside. Delivery service was very quick!,1471824000,,125,5.631578947368421
8382359,5,B002VQDUZ8,"I was a bit unhappy at first because no dvd player, blueray player, or even the newest Xbox, would play it. I felt so silly for not checking region.  This is a Region 2 dvd.  So after a bit, my brilliant son said ""try vlc, it ignores codecs"".  Sure enough, VLC (freeware) plays this just fine and in English with Swedish subtitles (or Norwegian, etc., your choice).  Now I can watch Tina--who doesn't love her shows. :)",1438214400,3,419,4.402597402597403
8382360,5,B002VQDUZ8,"I enjoyed this show because of it's mix of gourmet cooking and travel scenes.  The chef brings a lot of energy to the show, and is interesting for an American to hear.

The show makes me hungry for this kind of Nordic food and for another vacation in Scandinavia.  The half hour episodes go by in a flash.",1419292800,,305,4.224137931034483
