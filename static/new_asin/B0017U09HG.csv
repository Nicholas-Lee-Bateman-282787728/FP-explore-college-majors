8267262,5,B0017U09HG,Monty Don is a winner! Such enthusiasm and knowledge wrapped up in a down to earth presentation makes me want to walk along with him to see what he sees and marvel at the imaginations displayed in the landscapes and gardens shown. Have watched it several times already and will watch it at least several more. Thanks Monty! Keep bringing us more! How about the next 80???,1466985600,2,371,4.552238805970149

8267264,4,B0017U09HG,"I would love to watch this DVD, but when it arrived and I put it into the player, a note came on the screen to say that this DVD was not configured to play in Australia. I'm not sure what my next move is?",1436918400,,204,3.659090909090909

DVD itself is awesome~!",1423612800,,88,5.357142857142857
8267266,5,B0017U09HG,"This was a must view for all the gardeners in my life.
It makes an excellent present.
The only problem for many is that it is region 2, so if you don't have a region 2 DVD player, you are SOL.",1400544000,4,192,3.707317073170732
8267267,4,B0017U09HG,"The ideas presented by Monty Don are just wonderful.  He makes you understand peoples culture by visiting their gardens.  He speaks with passion for the subject that touches any watcher.  If you are a garden enthusiast -and I bet you are to buy such a DVD- you will find some hours of fantastic entertainment.  The quality of the work is very good.  Aerial footage, good interviews, some insights of the country and major cities,  good background music, in a word a very weldone work.  The missing star is that I found nearly a dozen of the 80 gardens that could not be called exactly a garden.  Some look more as plants deposit.  But even visiting those 'gardens', Monty manages to make you feel a special guest.  I recomend this wonderful work.",1383609600,,746,4.625954198473282
8267268,5,B0017U09HG,"I bought this DVD after seeing Monty in his Italian Garden programme. It has been a favourite ever since. It has no tips on how to grow better beetroot or how to make a pond, this is pure voyeurism. You get to see 80 gardens and enjoy the fact they're unique. I am a qualified horticulturalist and have had friends over who've watched some of this DVD with me. We all enjoyed it - there's a garden for everyone. But if you are a complete armchair gardener, a novice, a botanist, this DVD still has tremendous appeal because it's beautiful and Monty is passionate and interesting.",1379894400,5,579,4.471698113207547
8267269,1,B0017U09HG,"The dvd set was not formatted for this region of the world, I did not see any of it, I was refunded my money but not the postage, don't  waste your money or time. Daunn Munn",1368403200,,173,3.8055555555555554
