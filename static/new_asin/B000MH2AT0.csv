8169213,5,B000MH2AT0,"This DVD is so compelling in letting anyone into the world of secret societies, ranging from Ancient Knight Templar, to Freemason, to The Illuminati, to Skull and Bones, Biderberg etc... and how the possibility of a cynical World-wide Conspiracy Theory may be at work... A MUST VIEW DVD for anyone curious enough to know more about the existence of such societies and their evolution through History.
Provided me with a completely different perspective of the real world.
