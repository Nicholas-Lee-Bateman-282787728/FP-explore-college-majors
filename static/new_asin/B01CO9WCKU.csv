8753553,1,B01CO9WCKU,"This program runs only for 17 minutes and you pay $19.95 for that! In the description it said the running time was 44 minutes. What a joke! And there is no arm work out in there- - just some randomly  selected ballet movements at the ballet barre for the legs. You will hold your arms up in the second position. Sure, it works them yes, but I expected some targeted arm and back movements as well. But, of course, one can't squeeze all that in 17 minutes. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! !!!",1497052800,4,483,4.366666666666666
