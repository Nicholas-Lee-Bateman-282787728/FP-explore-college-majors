2640248,5,B000HRMATA,"Proof that the agenda doesn't have to be great - to create something truly great and of lasting value to everyone lucky enough (and with enough time)...to view the whole series.  It is at the top of my movie list - I love documentaries.

All teenagers could benefit from it - weren't they all vulnerable, miserable in some way - and didn't they all blossom?  They came into their own, thanks to their own courage and some good decisions in their mates.  I love all 14 of them and would so love to see them appreciate what they have created.  Of course it is a bitter pill for them.....they are at the epicenter.  But they have done a serious social service for the whole world.  Is this an over statement?  Not  in my view.",1168214400,5,723,4.335820895522388
2640249,5,B000HRMATA,"This series is the most touching, insightful and original documentary ever made. It may not have artistic beauty like we saw in other masterpieces such as ""The Triumph of The Will,"" but it offers insights into human life like no other film. If you're young, it'll make you think; if you're old, it will make you cry.",1166054400,7,316,4.56140350877193
2640250,4,B000HRMATA,"The 7 Up project started in 1963 as a Granada Films documentary about seven year old British children.  Director Michael Apted, himself only in his early twenties, set out to explore the British class system by interviewing youngsters from different economic backgrounds.  The film's hook was the old Jesuit saying, ""Show me the child until seven, and I will show you the man.""  Remarkably, Apted has gone back every seven years and updated his interviews with the dozen or so children he started with.  49 Up is the latest installment.

If you only watch  49 Up, you'll get enough back story to know who these people are, but the most satisfying approach is to go through the documentaries in the order they were shot.  We are voyeurs in the lives of: Andrew, John and Suzie, upper-class kids who knew early on who they were and what they would do;  Simon and Paul, abandoned by their mothers and raised in an orphanage;  Jackie, Sue and Lynne, working class girls from London's East End; Nick and Neil, middle class kids with an intellectual bent; Tony, a lively, lovable Cockney; and Bruce, who moves up and down the class ladder.  The films prove that you can see the man or woman who will emerge in the child of seven.  Their personalities are set; all that's unknown are the circumstances under which their lives will play out.

These are ordinary people; the genius of the series is that they become particular enough to us over the course of the films to feel special.  We care about them, and what happens to them.  At 49, the group seems much happier than they were in the previous two films.  Most of them have passed through the trauma of losing their parents, and they've made peace with career successes and setbacks.  In general, they now accept who they are; they're not fighting it or struggling to figure it out.

Class plays less of a role in these lives than the filmmakers initially thought it would.  Partly that's an accident of timing.  1963, when these children were seven, turned out to be a watershed year in Britain: the old wartime mentality was ending, the Beatles were beginning, and there was a sense of new possibilities in the air.  Between the sense of new opportunity and the economic entitlements of the various Labour governments, even the most disadvantaged of these children managed to carve out a reasonable lifestyle.  Temperament, more than economics, determined their fates.

Apted has a gift for balancing objectivity about these people (he asks some tough questions) and compassion for them.  It they didn't trust him, the series would have ended a long time ago.  He doesn't ask a lot of topical or political questions, so the temporal and trivial are stripped away.  What's left are moving images of people born in the middle of the twentieth century.  Watching them, we learn how they've faced the big issues of being human: dealing with their parents and upbringing; puberty; being open to the possibility of love; mating and breeding; finding their place in the world; the death of near and dear ones.  Of course, watching them is like watching ourselves.  Learning about them is learning about ourselves.  I'm rooting for all of them, and looking forward to seeing how they're faring at fifty six.",1165622400,60,3249,4.782764811490126
2640251,5,B000HRMATA,"Perhaps I am especially sentimental about this series because the participants are my age, but when ""49 Up"" came to a close with scenes from the original film, ""Seven Up,"" I found myself in tears.

It has been suggested that the series was originally intended to illustrate that children born into various social classes were destined to follow a specific course in life. But time has revealed something very different: that money, class, and education are superficial differences, and that all of us are bound by our common human experience. Every one of the participants has dealt with some sort of adversity -- the death of parents, divorce, illness, depression, loss of a job -- but has persevered with the love and support of family and friends. We learn about their joys, too -- the arrival of grandchildren, a new love, a new career.

Another reviewer commented that time has not been kind to most of the participants from a physical standpoint. No doubt a young person wrote that! Yes, many folks our age (including me) have put on some extra pounds, lost hair or gone grayer, or developed a few wrinkles. But I find their faces kinder and wiser and more beautiful, even more so when those who are married reaffirm their love for one another and talk about how their spouses have helped them through the hard times.

One thing that impresses me is that all of the subjects are good people -- not perfect, not immune from taking a wrong turn once in a while, but trying hard to do the right thing in life. I am so proud of all of them and can hardly wait seven years to find out how they have fared since I saw them last.

There are challenges ahead for Michael Apted and his crew. Clearly it is becoming more difficult for some of the participants to find their lives under scrutiny every seven years, for a couple of them suggested that ""49 Up"" will be their last film. At the same time, the sheer volume of footage will make it increasingly difficult to bring viewers up to date on each participant every seven years while including flashbacks from the previous films. (Even now, ""49 Up"" probably will not be as meaningful to those who have not seen the earlier films.)

But the series is historic, of deep and timeless value, and one of the most moving documentaries I have ever seen. I hope it will continue, but if some of the participants find later that they can't continue, nonetheless, in the first seven films they have given us an incomparable gift.",1163808000,32,2468,4.587301587301587
2640252,5,B000HRMATA,"'49 Up' took several subjects, mainly from London's East side, and did a documentary with the commitment to catch up with the subjects every seven years until reaching the year 2000.  They've now done that and more.  We see black and white footage of the participants, and each is interviewed separately, so in a time-lapsed fashion we see what their ideals and dreams are and how their lives turn out.  (After their seventh year, the rest of the film is done in color.)  Many interviewees become put off by their questioning, but every turn seems to bring about self-revealing initiatives about the careers, lives, and loves of key people.  Time in a bottle is the keyword, and we find ourselves getting lost in the details.  It is a fascinating film with satisfying developments.",1163721600,10,781,4.834586466165414
2640253,5,B000HRMATA,"I can't recall my introduction to the Up series, like the participants age is catching up with me.  But I have followed the series religiously and was dismayed when rumors circulated that 42 Up would be the last installment. Recently, while reading news from Australia online, I was delighted to learn that Neil (Hughes) was to be a guest speaker at the Annual Conference of the Municipal Association of Victoria (Australia). At 50 he was still going strong, now a local councilor in Eden District in northern England. And the local Victorian government had invited him to speak because they viewed him as a model to those toying with the idea of politics and public life. I thought I would chase down the 42 Up DVD and reacquaint myself with the series,.....and there it was 49 Up!

There is a voyeuristic aspect in viewing the Up series. But it is more than that; it is more than an obsessive recording of the lives of 14 individuals. As Roger Ebert notes in the accompanying interview of Michael Apted, many of us have grown up alongside these people and so the Up series is a chance for us to reflect on our own lives. I know of no other medium that allows such a personal examination of a single generation. A generation that, although it is the tail end of the baby boom, is none the less significant for the period it has covered. True, Apted is careful not to question too deeply about politics and world events, and this is as it should be. What is important (for the viewer to retain interest) is how the lives of these people progresses in terms of family, relationships, occupations etc - the stuff of everyday life. Whether political, economic, or world events influence their lives is less important; although in some cases this does occur and has been used by at least one participant to leverage a personal interest.

Many, if not all, the participants seem to view their involvement as a stressful event every seven years, a poison pill. It seems from 49 Up that at least one and perhaps more may not return for 56 Up.  This would be unfortunate as 49 Up showed that most had reached a comfortable plateau in their lives, and one imagines that in the next seven years many will become even more comfortable within themselves and relish the opportunity to reflect back on life. Others are sure to be less comfortable with that. One thing is certain, we (the viewers) should feel privileged that these individuals allow us the opportunity to invade their lives every seven years.",1163548800,16,2494,4.635746606334842
2640254,5,B000HRMATA,"When I saw ""49 Up"" in the theaters, I had never seen any of the previous episodes from the series, and came into it with fresh eyes and no context in which to place director Michael Apted's subjects.  Also, being an American viewer, my awareness of the class struggle (greatly emphasized here from the perspective of Apted's British ""stars,"" so to speak) is quite different and, in many ways, the subject of the Briton relationship to class was a bit like a foreign language.  What's more, this was the seventh in his ""Up!"" series, and the characters that some people had known over the years, have settled into their middle age (some more gracefully than others).

What worked so well, here, was the great sensitivity and attention to detail that Michael Apted clearly had, when providing archived clips from the previous films, as well as bringing the viewers up to speed with the subjects, their marriages (and divorces), children, career changes and the parallel between their views, feelings and perceptions as seven year old children, progressing all the way into their middle age at 49.  We see a great cross section of the public, portrayed on film, in the ""case studies"" of his subjects.  There's everything from the snooty upper class (three young boys who are all attending private academies, looking down on those from lower stock, and basically continuing their perpetual feelings of superiority into middle age), to young men who grew up in a children's home together (one, the product of a single parent home--the only example of this in the movie).

There are great humorous moments here, as well as insightful and very poignant points that really make the subjects out to be human, just like the rest of us.  The accessiblity into their lives, hearts and inner most secrets could come off as voyeuristic.  Instead, Apted very sensitively presents the ups, downs, triumphs and tribulations with grace and class.  I highly reccomend this.",1161993600,12,1953,4.948012232415902
2640255,3,B000HRMATA,"I came into this film totally cold as far as the Up Series is concerned. So I had no connection to these people and no context for their situations. This does not end up causing me any problems at all because director Michael Apted comprises this film of about 50% new material and 50% old material from previous films. I certainly don't get to see these people grow up organically as I would have had I watched the films in order. But instead I get a nifty CliffNotes version that fills in all the important blanks. 49 may not be the most exciting age to be as most of these people have settled into their family lives, but thanks to some movie magic I get to see exactly how they got there. In the future I look forward to going back and watching all the other films in the series, but even if you are like me and have never seen any others you can still enjoy this one because I certainly did. It is incredibly interesting and definitely worth checking out. One thing that really struck me was just how similar their lives turned out. At the beginning of ""Trainspotting"" Ewan McGregor's character says ""Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family,"" and that is exactly what these people did. And that is fine, these people weren't delusional, they just wanted to find happiness and for better or for worse that is how they found it. They almost all turned out to be decent human beings with the exception being one woman who launches into a scorching tirade against Apted and the project in general. She seems upset about editing in his previous films, but it took no CGI here to make her look downright certifiable. Of course the rich kids stayed rich and the poor kids stayed poor, but that is the whole point of the series. You don't just play the hand you're dealt, you are the hand you're dealt.

All of this is far more interesting than it ever should be. These are regular people with regular lives. I do believe that the film is hurt by Apted's line of questioning as it is soft and generic. He could have asked them about timely matters such as world events or politics, those things can tell us as much about a person as their families or careers. Also, he was always pushing them to admit that they are lazy and not ambitious. Maybe he could have asked the business man if he felt as though he spent too much of his life at the office. It is also worth noting that Mother Nature was not kind to these people. The men got off easier than the women, but Nick was the only one who seems to have improved looks wise over time. The film unconsciously asks the question if we are all doomed to become fat and domestic, and then they answer it with a resounding yes. But maybe I'm being too hard on these people. 21 is obviously a more turbulent time than 49 and we can't all be stallions forever. But with age they have picked up a real distaste for this project. A few of them even try to call out the viewers for being voyeuristic, but what person watching this film isn't already aware of that? These people at least have the option to opt out of the project (as 2 have already done), but what about those poor saps on ""Cops"" who are forced to live out their most humiliating moment on network TV? If I can gulp that down and not feel any guilt then these people don't stand a chance. Maybe if they had posed that question a few decades ago, you know, before the reality TV craze, then maybe people would have listened. But as it is they are now just another exhibit in the freak show that is our culture. ***1/2",1161475200,8,3539,4.313813813813814
2640256,5,B000HRMATA,"I started watching Michael Apted's ongoing documentary series in 1971 when Apted's first film (the second in the series, but first directed by Apted) ""14 UP"" was shown in US theaters. I remember seeing ""21 UP"" as well but then missed the next series of films until this year when ""49 UP"" was released.

""Give me a child until he is seven, and I will give you the man,"" goes a Jesuit proverb, which the 'Up' documentaries quote. At seven year intervals Director Apted revisited 14 children in his native country of Britain. This was early ""reality TV"" before the concept was given a name. While the children were from so-called ""diverse"" backgrounds, they were mostly economic diverse rather than ethnically diverse. All but one are Caucasian. What is amazing is that all 14 are still living at age 49 and, though one woman has said that she doesn't wish to continue to participate in the series, all 14 are covered in this most recent chapter of the series.

The most important thing to know is that this film stands on it's own and does not require watching the previous chapters. Director Apted uses enough footage from the prior films to, not only bring you up to date, but to show you immediate similarities to what the ""kids"" looked like as they grew older. Though I may go back to the films I missed, I didn't feel that it was necessary.

At over 2 hours in length, this is not a short film but it will hold your attention.

As a bonus the DVD adds a 30 minute interview with Director Apted and film critic Roger Ebert. This only adds to the enjoyment of the DVD. Strangely, what sounds like an air conditioner running in the background (or it could be just poor miking) runs through the interview that was recorded in June 2006. This is a minor defect as it's the feature film you will be watching and the sound on that is perfect.

You remember these 14 people long after you watch this film. It'll be another 7 years before the next film is made - (How does Apted keep track of where these folks are over the years?) - and I, for one am anxious to see what road their lives will take by the time it's ready for Apted to film ""56 UP"".",1160006400,42,2142,4.385390428211587
2640257,5,B000HRMATA,"I stayed up much too late last night going through the whole series.  I would advise anyone new to this to do the same as the longer looks at the characters does help.  I've watched this series from 14 up onwards as they were released, come from London and was born in 1961.  As others have mentioned, this is still an extraordinary project and will eventually capture whole lifespans on film.  One of the fascinating things for me, rewatching the series is that I have stopped judging the characters and spend more time questioning myself and the methods and medium of the documentary.  It's interesting to think of where you were at these ages and imagine Apted coming along and recording for posterity your failings and sucesses.  I worked out that at 21, 28, 35 etc...he would have caught me at all the in-between moments - where I was searching, not necessarily applying myself constructively and would have missed all the moments of triumph and positive change.  I remember the nation going into mourning for Neil in 1984 when 28 UP was released.  Everyone fell in love with the delightful toothy 7 year old and to see him alone and bedraggled in the Highlands of Scotland was tragic.  But you have to wonder about Apted's choice of camera-work and his own  criteria for 'happiness' and indeed his own middle-class values - something that has never come up to the best of my knowledge.  You can't seperate the observer from the observed.  As others have mentioned, Neil was the only one to break away from any conventional ideas of how to live one's life.  The shots of him alone in the rain in a caravan put across a sadness and bleakness but Apted could equally have put him across as a very thoughtful, philosophical person who actually dared to question the point of living on the conveyor belt of consumerism we're all supposed to buy into.
Similarly, Suzy at 21 seemed to me to have a lot more going for her than at 28, where she seemed to have settled down into comfy home counties bliss.  And Apted remarks what a 'miracle' it is that she's no longer the 'nervous, chain-smoking 21 year old.  Oh hang on...I'm judging again.
Most of the films do touch on the opinions of the participants to the process, but very slightly.  You'd think that in this day and age a 'video diary' approach could be used, or even the tables turned on Apted by each participant interviewing him.  He is 'the eye' in every episode and it's inevitable that his visual opinions are stamped on this project.",1279929600,,2495,4.608597285067873
2640258,3,B000HRMATA,"I've followed Michael Apted's documentary series from the beginning so I was interested in seeing the latest installment, 49 Up.  Unfortunately, I found the film incredibly predicable and boring.  Is it the participants' middle age?  They all seemed so much more alive and interesting in their earlier incarnations.

The stand out among the people portrayed herein has always been Neil.  All the others seem to follow the same predicable path - settling down, marriage and children.  Yawn.  We do not watch a documentary to see people falling into well established patterns.  Neil characterizes himself by being a loner and by suffering with depression and/or mental illness.  He doesn't fit well into society and becomes homeless.  Later, Neil rebounds, becoming involved politically or in community affairs.  In 49 Up, we see Neil is involved in the church and is still without a partner.  His spartan lifestyle is somewhat subsidized by social welfare in order of living quarters.  While watching this, my heart went out to Neil, and his story resonated with me.

2640260,5,B000HRMATA,"This a really good documentary. and I think Micheal has tried to stay fairly objective (although he does slip at times)
I found this film quite touching. Its moving to see little children grow up-blossom into someone beautiful or dig themselves into a hole-and the only face you can put on that 49 year person is a small child's.
I don't have children, but I can see why any parent would love this film.
Does this documentary have an real value? does it teach us anything? I really don't think so.
The only lesson I did take away was that, if you hit the ground running( a decent family, well to do, educated parents etc), you're more likely to make it in this big bad world.",1230768000,,675,4.365079365079365
2640261,4,B000HRMATA,"I've read about this series for years but just never got around to watching any of them. The first film was made in 1964 and was titled 7 Up. It featured a group of seven- year old English school children from different schools, locations and social classes. (Some were from public schools and some were from private schools, which leads to ongoing confusion for me since in England a public school is what we would call a private school and vice versa.)
 Apted was 22 years old when he made the first film, and he thought it would be a one time project. But he continued to make a film every seven years, featuring the same people profiled in the first film (though some have dropped out of the project over the years).
 49 Up is the film I watched, and it features footage from all the projects made through the years (7 Up, 14 Up, 21 Up, 28 Up, 35 Up, and 42 Up). One of the subjects of the films, John, wonders if the whole thing is just an elaborate exercise in reality TV, but it certainly is much more.
 The film captures the idealism of childhood that is often crushed by the realities of the world. It is interesting to see how the filmmaker also had preconceptions that are crushed through the years in much the same way.
 In the first film Apted quotes the Jesuits who said, ""Show me a boy at seven I give you the man."" Some of the children make predictions about their lives that are uncannily accurate (Andrew, for instance, at seven years old predicts the schools he will attend and his profession as a solicitor). But some of the kids defy expectations. Some kids from broken homes fear relationships, but go on to build good marriages and become good parents. Some make foolish mistakes and spoil their childhood dreams and potential.
 One interesting theme is the importance of one's roots as an adult. Nick leaves England and moves to the States.  The filmmakers take him back to his homeland for this edition of the film. The landscape of the country of his youth was the cold and harsh moors of northern England. He says he does not miss this land but then, when he sees it, he is moved. He says that other locations seem insignificant in comparison.
 Most of the subjects talk about how painful it can be to have their lives captured on film every seven years and have it broadcast (on the BBC as well as in the movie theaters) for millions to see. Jackie brings up the unfair nature of a filmmaker's option to pick and choose the segments of their interviews he will use, and feels that she and others have been treated unfairly. Suzy tells Apted she believes 49 will be her last time to participate.
 The films remind me of the moment in Annie Hall when children in a classroom stand up and say what they will do in their later lives (one elementary school student in that film stands and says, ""I will become a heroin addict and die of an overdose"".)
 When we look at children, we don't like to think about the trials they will inevitably face in the years to come. But we also can't conceive of the wonderful things they will do in the future.
 One of the kids, John, at seven is a child of privilege who talks with his friends about how good it is that his school is expensive, because otherwise poor children would flood in and his classes would be too crowded. You think this kid will grow to be one of the upper class twits so successfully lampooned by Monty Python. To a degree, you'd be right. He goes on to be a barrister who looks quite a bit like Mr. Bean.
 But there is more to his story. He was drawn to the woman he married by a shared concern for the poor in the Eastern Europe. The reason he continues to do the film series is to draw attention to the educational and medical needs in Bulgaria.
 John is not alone. We see other children grow to be very good men and women who care for their families and for the needs of the less fortunate.
 The most poignant segment of the film is about Neil, a bright young kid whose life takes some nasty turns. As a teen, he says he doubts there is a God. At seven, he had dreams of college and career, but he later drops out of school and has trouble finding work. He becomes homeless and admits to questioning his own sanity. In 35 Up, one might have questioned whether the man will even be alive in the next film. But in 49 Up we see a very different man. Little is said about religion in the segments on most of the characters, but Neil in this film has found Jesus. And it has made all the difference in the world.
 49 Up came out in 2006. I would now like to see six other films. And I'm looking forward to 2013.",1227916800,2,4595,4.290993071593533
2640262,5,B000HRMATA,"I've been watching this fascinating series from the start, and have loved it totally.  There is something so incredibly fascinating about seeing how these kids turned (and will turn) out. The most amazing thing about it, for me, is that every single one of them became a decent, responsible, thoughtful human being, and that has nothing to do with class or economics, as the film proves.  I am so touched at their incredible idealism, their faith, their intelligence, and their grace.  Each one of them still has a beautiful, beaming countenance, except, of course, for Neil.  That said, it is Neil whom I really connect with.  He was perhaps, in my mind, the most beautiful of the children, with an almost otherworldly innocence about him that is sublime.
Watching this installment, I  wished I could go back in time and protect him from the slings and arrows he would face as an adult.  He turned out to be the most troubled of the group, and I can't help thinking that he was almost ""too good for this world,"" as they say, a quality that showed up early.  Still, what he has done with his life at this time is remarkable; he is giving both social and spiritual service to others, and what else is there, really, for a person to be able to say ""I gave my best""?  He has the mind of a philosopher, and I wonder if he writes poetry. I love his beautiful, suffering face.  He's actually very handsome, and I wish he would find a wonderful woman who could make his life a little less lonely, as have the other males in the series.  All in all, it's an extremely loveable group of people.  I can't wait to visit with them again, but I have a bit of guilt about that, because some of them indicated that the filming is a huge intrusion on their privacy - their lives - and, as one of them said, ""It opens up a can of worms every seven years "" (or something like that, old wounds, etc.).  I guess I would like to say ""Thank you!"" to each of them, for giving us a glimpse into their lives, which, in a sense, is a glimpse into ours.  And also - thank you for being good role models.  This film teaches one what it means to grow up and lead a good life.  Hugs to one and all, and thanks to Michael Apted, who made a beautiful series.",1222992000,2,2226,4.2894736842105265
2640263,5,B000HRMATA,"Yes, he did it again! One of the great filmic projects of the 20th Century, Michael Apted's The Up Series, makes its entre into the new millennium with the seventh bravura installment of its documentary format. Although shown on British television over the last four decades, viewers in other parts of the world have usually had to see it on the big screen, in local arts and independent theaters. Late this year, the DVD of the 49 Up was released in America, just a few weeks after its theatrical release, and it's a worthwhile successor to earlier films. While the series' participants wax bitterly, on occasions, many wax philosophically, displaying one of the series' greatest virtues- showing that the average person is not necessarily as doltish as modern reality television would lead you to believe. Given an opportunity to reflect, average folks can stumble upon real wisdom, rather than the Lowest Common Denominator stupidity that American `reality' shows like Survivor or Fear Factor highlight. Of course, neither of those shows is reality- they are merely staged gimmick shows. The Up Series is `real reality,' and no, there won't be a new episode in a week's time to appease the speed addicted MTV mindset. It'll take seven long years before the next entry pulls into port.
  The series began as the brainchild of the Left Wing ITV television show World In Action, made by Granada Television, which in 1964 sought out typical school children from the lower and upper classes of English life. Back then, the class system in Merry Olde England was noteworthy, as the voiceover intoned, `The executive and the shop steward of the year 2000 are seven years old,' but by the third installment, 21 Up- in 1978, the lives of these ordinary people took precedence over political posturing, and the series was firmly in control of co-producer Apted- director of The World Is Not Enough, Coal Miner's Daughter, and Gorillas In The Mist, who was merely an assistant on the original Seven Up. The motto of the series has always been the notion espoused by a Jesuit proverb: `Give me a child until he is seven, and I will give you the man.' That seems to have proven a durable- if not infallible, wisdom....Some viewers and critics feel that this should be the last episode. I disagree, for people like that are injecting a `purpose' into the films, rather than extracting one out of them. This is often a problem with news coverage in any field. Centuries and eons from now, this series will be a Rosetta Stone- despite the immense tracking of our culture via printed media, films, radio, television, and the Internet, for it was the first one to focus on average people, whatever their backgrounds. These participants will become icons who are studied and debated long after most of their peers are dust; a fact which may explain their reluctance to appear in it, but not excuse it, for the nobler option is almost always to serve the betterment of all. Is a few minutes onscreen glimpse into real reality that much of a loathsome burden?
  By 56 Up, it would not shock me if the first death occurs within the fourteen- I just get a sense of it- perhaps Lynn or Jackie, or perhaps some tragedy, so that sense makes each episode with all of them all the more meaningful. The series, as a whole, and this installment, shows that there is a great nobility in utility, which is best summed up by wisdom that Bruce imparts: `When dreams go and the day to day living of ordinary life and family life takes over, I think we just sort of live without our dreams.' In what other medium does the offhanded poesy that too much fictive art misses come so vividly to life? Where else do people show off the best in themselves- an ability to cogitate, reason, empathize, and reflect, rather than the worst- their own petty envies and lusts?....The reason why the series touches so many others is precisely because they lack such things as artistic talent or a platform to be seen. If I can be so moved, merely by the memory of watching the earlier installments of this film, I have to believe that most of the participants- whom we all know and refer to by their first names, as they age and wise up a bit more, will see that they, too, have been touched by something greater than anything their lives, alone can signify. And the fact that their touching will last long beyond flesh on flesh is something anyone reading this review, now or in the far future, can be thankful for.",1220486400,2,4468,4.680661577608142
2640264,5,B000HRMATA,"The high standard first set by Michael Apted many years ago continues in this most recent installment - 49 up. This series has been a brilliant series throughout and having watched all previous productions I can vouch for the high quality of this one. Almost all of the characters return and there are some unsuspecting surprises. As soon as the picture appeared I felt a sense of meeting up with old friends again. My only disappointment was that a couple of original characters did not appear. Nevertheless, I only have praise for 49 Up and eagerly await 56 Up. For those, who like me have watched the various individuals develop through their childhood, adolescence and now into adulthood do not miss this latest of installments. It is worth every penny.",1214092800,,757,4.8307692307692305
2640265,1,B000HRMATA,"I am absolutely fascinated by human behavior, social psychology, and certainly being given the opportunity to be a voyeur (of sorts) into the lives of others.  I was so excited when I saw this documentary at Blockbuster, and could not wait to watch it.  I was completely disappointed though.  With the exception of Neil, these people were simply a group of average Joes living boring, conventional lives.  I understand that there was no way to foresee this in the first interview in 1964, and I understand not wanting to throw away 42 years of film.  That said, the director got nothing here.  With the exception of the eccentric Neil, every single person got married, had kids, some got divorced and remarried, and some had grandchildren.  I think one person did create a wonderful organization with his wife, which deserves recognition.  But that's it.  Even the people themselves sometimes ask, Why are you doing this film and Why am I participating.  One dropped out.  And thank god for that.  I don't know how much longer I could have sat waiting for this film to present something worth the $4 I spent to rent it.

I do not recommend this movie.  I mean no disrespect to those portrayed in it, but I couldn't care less about their average lives.",1206662400,3,1251,4.7050691244239635

2640267,2,B000HRMATA,"Documentaries are usually my favorite form of the medium, and I often very much like ones about subject matter that I have no general interest in, if they are well done. I can't honestly say this film isn't necessarily well done, but..it bored me into a stupor. I tend to like old fashioned, simple things..and often quote the  comment attributed to Andy Warhol...""I like boring things."" But, after approximately an hour and 1/2, I had to stop this film, before the remote fell from my numb hand and while I could still move my neck. With the glowing reviews by not only major critics, but, the reviews posted here on Amazon, I expected to be warmed, transfixed, educated, and generally moved by this film. I wasn't looking for sensationalism, and the prospect of seeing ""normal"" lives evolve, rather than the fake and shallow exploits of some heiress, was definately promising. But, for me, these chosen folks, while perfectly nice and mostly affable people, had the most boring, generic, ""average"" lives imaginable.  It had all the appeal of choosing any randomly chosen person/family, and turning on the camera and letting them ramble on and on about ther lives, and, let's face it, most lives are not the stuff of engrossing drama or lesson. I kept waiting for the high points, the life altering epiphanies, the triumphs, the tragedies, all resulting in the lessons learned for us all to share. Instead, I get monotonous daily monologues about children, grandchildren, work, life, your basic disappointments like divorce, etc...and, I found them all to be ""flatliners.""  Not being at all a fan of talk shows where so called normal people air their dirtiest laundry, I was ready for a refreshing take and the life altering appreciation promised on the dvd's cover, , but instead I got what was for me a mind numbing disappointment. I have been more moved by an episode of  ""Behind The Music""  than by this leaden,  non offensive but soporific film. Clearly I am in the minority in my opinion of this film, so, maybe it's me. But, for me, it was one long snore............",1184544000,3,2074,4.828169014084507
2640268,5,B000HRMATA,"This documentary will probably never be surpassed in my lifetime, because no one has attempted a project as ambitious as this around the same time Micheal Apted started this series in 1964.  I've been keeping up with this series since I discovered 28 Up and it has had a profound impact on my life.  Every time I see a new chapter of the series, I not only look at each of the subjects lives and review things, but at my life as well.  No one will be able to watch this film and not have someone or something in it to relate to.  Roger Ebert said that this is the most noble use of the film medium.

This DVD has an interview between Micheal Apted and Roger Ebert.  In the interview, Roger Ebert said that this documentary will be talked about 200 years from now.  I can see that happening because it's so profound and there is so much in it to talk about.

By far, the most compelling character of this series has been Neil and another compelling character has been Tony.  We are drawn to these characters because they seem parodoxical and contradictory.  Roger Ebert mentioned in the interview that at one point, Micheal Apted was concerned that Tony would wind up being a criminal.  Just look at Tony now!  And Neil... in 35 Up he said that he was going mad and appeared suicidal.  Few would be able to ever predict where he is in life at the age of 49.

I defie anyone to watch this film without taking a long hard look at themselves and at life in general.",1180483200,8,1461,4.2846715328467155
2640269,5,B000HRMATA,"This latest installment in the Up Series proves that ordinary human lives are just as compelling as any story that Hollywood puts out. So rarely do documentaries provide insight into what it means to be human (public radio's This American Life is one of the few exceptions) but Michael Apted and his brave subjects have achieved real illumination through their unflinchingly honest interviews.

It perhaps goes without saying, but if you haven't seen the earlier installments of this Up series then I wholeheartedly recommend starting from the beginning, 7 Up.",1177286400,3,560,5.222222222222222

2640271,5,B000HRMATA,"Once again, Michael Apted and team do a superb job on 49 Up!

As a follow-up to my Up Series review, 49 Up is a fantastic next installment in the lives of the children now adults. This program is a satisfying update on the struggles of the documented, who mostly have come to a more mature and peaceful stage in their life.

Conversation gets more mature and internal in this show. Tony and John finally make social comments, which gives insight to the times, as this program shows that notions of class are changing in Britain - some for the better, some for the worse.

Jacqui, Neil and Nicholas get more personal and Symon and Paul get together with their wives.

They only get better!",1173052800,4,688,4.48
2640272,4,B000HRMATA,"Having followed the lives of the individuals from age 7, I was looking forward to the new episode where they have reached age 49. Will Tony still be married? Will Paul be happier? Will Jacqui still be in Scotland? Will Bruce and Nick still be saving/changing the world? Will John take part and will Charles and Peter come back in to the series? And what will Neil be up to? And Sue and Suzie and Lyn? I feel like I know all the characters well and almost as personal friends and I really want to know what they are all up to. Do they have grandchildren? Have any of them become sick? Heart disease and cancer often strike at around this age. The whole series is a fascinating study and the question John puts - ""does it really prove anything"" is a worthwhile question but it doesn't make the series any less rivetting.

The comment was made by a number of them that they are ""comfortable in their own skin now"" and Neil's view on life and why we are here are two of the many things which make the movie worth watching. I thoroughly recommend this movie and the 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 Ups.",1171843200,4,1090,4.240384615384615

If you haven't followed the lives featured in the every-seven-years installments, do yourself a favor and buy the collection, then watch them in order. Although some of the subjects in ""49 UP"" talk about the negative ways in which the series has affected their lives, the tone in general is gentler and more hopeful than the last documentary. Maybe they are mellowing with age. Although there is inevitably something voyeuristic about watching people talk about these lives we've shared, warts and all, one can't help but feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to participate in this cinema verite.",1170892800,3,766,4.945736434108527

2640275,4,B000HRMATA,"The concept of Michael Apted's series is so compelling that watching any of them is well-worth two hours of anyone's time.  49-Up is no exception, especially since nearly all the participants have reached a touching level of inner peace and acceptance of their lives.  This latest installment is distinctive in that a number of the participants express real resentment towards Apted and describe the process of being in the films as difficult and emotionally harrowing.  While this aspect makes 49-Up somewhat hard to watch at times (viewers can't help but wonder just how cold and intrusive Apted can be), it is thought-provoking and calls into questions the ethics and purpose of the project, especially in this day and age of reality TV.",1169078400,3,740,5.049180327868853

This is one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time. I purchased both the 49 Up and 56 Up. I have let my high school classmates borrow the DVD since we do a reunion every five years. They loved it as well. My only disappointment was that purchasing the DVD there was no option for captions. I was surprised they left out the captions. I could understand most of what was said, but some of the accents were hard to follow.
 Also to note this DVD is in PAL format, and not NTSC. PAL is the DVD format used by the UK. Make sure your DVD player will play PAL. In this day and age that should not be an issue.

8140959,5,B000HRMATA,"The 'Up Series' represents one of the most fascinating and unusual uses of film in cinema history - a documentary life-long chronicle of the lives of 14 people starting at 7 years old, revisiting them every seven years through age 56 (so far), presented largely through simple, straightforward, beautifully done interviews.

This film is from the more recent part of that journey. And while it can be enjoyed in a vacuum, the true power of the piece is watching these people through the arc of their whole lives.  Watching one piece out of that context can't have quite the same power.  This is a case where the sum is greater than the parts, even if the parts are all pretty terrific.

In terms of the series as a whole (which I strongly suggest you seek out) - while I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there (especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasis on love and marriage at the expense of all else), it's really an astounding, moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watch this remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's own life, and how you have changed (and stayed the same) over your own lifetime.

While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for this amazing piece of cultural anthropology, it's important to note that the first film, 7 Up,was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a that point a researcher for the project.",1298678400,,1444,4.691699604743083
