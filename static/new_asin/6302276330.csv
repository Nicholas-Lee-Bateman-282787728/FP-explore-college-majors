7824368,4,6302276330,"20 years ago this was awesome, and now that I have kids....  It's still awesome.  I wish it was on DVD!",1446076800,,103,3.857142857142857
7824369,5,6302276330,Am very pleased with the video. It is in better condition than expected. Grandkids love it. Was really pleased it arrived at least two days sooner than expected. Had one for years and played it so much for the older Grandkids that it wore out when it was time for the younger ones to see it.,1352073600,,291,4.214285714285714
7824370,5,6302276330,"My two year old son absolutely loves this video and asks to watch it over and over.  Elmo and Big Bird star.  I've seen it so many times with him, I know the words to the song ""Waiting for the Bell to Ring""!  It teaches kids what firefighters do and talks about fire safety and what to do in a fire - all in a fun way. We recently had the chance to go to our fire station for an open house and he was so excited that he got to see all the stuff he sees on the video.  A ""must have"" for your future firefighter!",1098316800,,510,3.7383177570093458
7824371,5,6302276330,"During a recent hospital stay, I found this video in the playroom for my 18 month old son to watch.  He was mesmerized!  Already familiar with Elmo and Big Bird, he loved ""meeting"" Oscar and seeing the fire trucks.  He learned to request the video by making a siren noise ""whee, whee, whee"", and despite our efforts to interest him in different videos, he repeatedly requested this one - every day, several times/day.  That's why I bought it when we got home...he kept asking for it and we didn't have it! He is silent while it's on, except for various parts like when Big Bird can't fit down the firepole (""uh-oh"").  It is not dated, despite being produced over 10 years ago, still very relevant.  Great video!",1016236800,,711,4.559055118110236
7824372,5,6302276330,My 2 1/2 year old son watches this video every single day.  It has tought him alot about the fire house adn the things that fire truck and fire people do.  I believe that this is a very important thing for a child to  understand.  He now knows that when the fire whistle blows that means there  is a fire.,963014400,2,305,4.016666666666667
7824373,5,6302276330,"The first time I put this video in for my 2 1/2 year old triplet boys. I  didn't hear a word out of them until the video was over, then they all  chanted ""more Firehouse"" they watched this video 6 times and sat  very nicely on the couch the entire time. Before their afternoon nap they  all notice the fire alarm in the hall by their bedroom and said ""Get  out fast!!!"" I was amazed that they actually understood the video.  I  would highly recommend this video for all toddlers. I will be purchasing  more videos to this affect in the future.",960768000,,543,4.254901960784314
