5444752,5,B00AJXO56I,The end of a great series and sadly having to say goodbye to a great cast of characters especially the character of V. D'Onofrio,1359072000,17,128,4.375
5444753,4,B00AJXO56I,"Fans of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" were fortunate to get a final season of this longtime cable TV favorite.  After a ninth season in which lead characters Detectives Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Eames (Kathryn Erbe) had seemingly departed the Major Case Squad and the series, they were brought back for a shortened tenth season of eight episodes, with a new boss and all-new cases.

The new cases follow a familiar and successful formula: off-beat murder cases in which the detectives must smoke out the intent of one or more suspects and secure a confession.  The final cases range from Broadway to the Catholic Church, the fashion industry, a mercenary security company, and an online dating service.  Guest stars include, among others, Cynthia Nixon and Neil McDonough.

Detective Bobby Goren has returned to work in a probationary status; he must pass a psychiatric evaluation to be fully restored to duty.  His weekly encounters with Dr. Paula Gyson (an excellent Julia Ormond) are a highlight of the final season.  The sessions are an uncomfortable expedition into Goren's psyche, and there is real dramatic tension over whether his return will be approved by a seemingly skeptical Dr. Gyson.  Goren's need to return to detecting is palpable, and the sessions also raise some interesting questions about his relationship with Eames.  The low-key but oddly satisfying finale's final moments will appropriately feature the two detectives.  Highly recommended to fans of ""Criminal Intent.""",1358553600,52,1497,5.2521008403361344

But my original purchase of thi set -- each one of the DVDs had extensive damage -- pixellating, stopping, etc. Amazon replaced it -- but I still had the hassle and expense of sending the original shipment back.

5444767,5,B00AJXO56I,"I know, people loved the Mothership. I did, too. People also go on about SVU, and I respect that, too.

But I think CI was just as interesting as the other two. Sure, it was more cerebral, which translated to boring for some, but I *liked* that this show came at crime from a unique angle. The Sherlock Holmes/Watson vibe with Goren and Eames added something extra (to me) in the midst of the usual murder du jour cases. So it was with relief when I read that VDO/KE were returning after their exits the season before.

It's just too bad that S10 was the end of such a great series. But at least it ended with Vincent D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe back as Bobby Goren and Alex Eames, as it should be! (We won't discuss the wretchedness of Season 9...)",1465430400,,748,4.297872340425532

5444769,3,B00AJXO56I,"The final season tries to make up for all the garbage we had to sit through with Season 9. All the Goldblum/Burrows episodes we had to sit through that stunk.
They bring back the original stars for a glorified miniseries finale.

I guess we should be happy with what we get though. I heard it was a fight to even get this out of this sinking ship. Things are sort of resolved by the end of the series. I would have liked John Glover to pop up again, escape jail or something. Or that son of Tony Goldwyn's that was presumed missing at the end of season 7.  But that doesn't occur. Mostly we just have Goren working through his issues with the shrink which mostly then resorts to clip shows of the show's greatest hits.

The cases are great though. Way better than the tripe we had to sit through last season. It's just really sad that this was not given a full 22 or 23 episode final season. But I guess we can just count small blessings we even got this.",1462147200,,955,4.2076502732240435

I hope ""Goren and Eames"" (Vincent D'Onofrio & Kathryn Erbe) return in a sequel. The only downer in Season 10 is the actor playing the role of the captain (Jay O Sanders) a former 'heavy' in a previous episode.  IMO Wolf was reaching to fill this role.

5444791,5,B00AJXO56I,"This is a superb season and an appropriate final one for one of the finest dramas in television history.  While the original Law and Order was excellent, with an outstanding cast doing wonderful work (Jerry Orbach, Sam Waterston, and Stephen Hill in particular) the spin-offs have been hit or miss.  SVU is a total abomination, tasteless trash, with astonishingly repetitive writing and D""actors whose expression seem to be cast in concrete.  In contrast. Criminal Intent features fine writing, great direction, and superb acting from two of the most gifted actors to ever appear on any series.  While D'Onofrio stands out with his method style and flashy style, it is amazing that Kathryn Erbe is able to match or even surpass him with incredible performances week after week.  On first viewing, Erbe's Eames seems to be given little to do but with stunning skill, Erbe builds upon her character over time and manages to create one of the unforgettable female police officers, or any other woman, ever portrayed.  You will find that it is her character who will bring humor, emotion, and depth to many episodes and it is those stories that focus more on her that will often move you, bring tears to your eyes, and etch themselves in your memory.  It would be wonderful if she were given a television role that would display her gifts as well as her theater work has.  However, the chemistry between Eames and Goren is the most interesting part of this program and which gives the proceedings life on a weekly basis.  For viewers who have just discovered Criminal Intent through reruns, I envy you all that awaits you.  If you can, try to start from the beginning of the series and follow the growth and change in Goren and Eames.  They have a remarkable relationship and the last episode's closing scene leaves the viewer imagining many possibilities for the two of them.  You won't regret investing in this set of CD's if you are longtime fan or someone just beginning your journey with these wonderful characters.",1401408000,,2016,4.828488372093023

5444795,5,B00AJXO56I,"It was interesting, watching this last season and all the angst in Goren coming out. I was glad to see Goren and Eames together again. I don't have season 9, and don't know if I'll bother. Jeff Goldblum's character always annoyed me, though my husband never liked the Goren character much, so I guess it's a matter of taste. I was glad they gave us a chance to say goodbye after the way D'Onofrio and Erbe were forced unceremoniously off the show. Although I hated to see them go, I think the ending was appropriate.

5444801,5,B00AJXO56I,"I'm happy that the final season only featured Goren and Eames. The stories are interesting and I love watching both of them solve the case. I was satisfied with the end and I thought i was appropriate. Vincent is a great actor. Erbe holds her own and does a wonderful job. Eames is great at knowing how to deal with her partner that seems a bit unbalanced at times. They work well together and they have respect for each other.

If you like this type of show, get the entire series from beginning to end. I generally skip the Christopher Noth episodes although I thought he did a good job. I completely skipped Jeff Goldblum's episodes. His don't interest me so I haven't taken the time to watch them. This show about Goren and Eames and it should have stayed that way for the entire run. The core cast was much smaller than the other L&R shows so it didn't need to have a revolving door of actors.",1391731200,6,898,4.345238095238095

I am very glad that this final season really focused on Dets. Goren and Eames and I also enjoyed that Goren had to see a shrink to deal with some of his issues.

5444818,5,B00AJXO56I,"I especially liked 2 Law and Orders...the Law and Order (1st main series with Sam Waterston, Jesse Martin, S Epatha Merkesan, Jerry Orbach...others of course) and then the ""Criminal Intent"" series with Vince D'Onfrio and Kathryn Erbe. I never missed seeing an episode and when DVD'S came out, I got to see them over whenever I desired to (very often.)
The actors change over time with a long series but that the characters of Bobby Goren and Alex Eames stayed the same was the frosting on the cake for sure. I tell friends that I saw a chemistry was between the 2 of them and when that happens in a story, well, we have hit real pay dirt. I could go on and on about this series, how some of the others that came and left I miss so much too...as Jamey ""Capt. Deakins"" Sheridan, the man who played ADA Carver...also Chris Noth who played ""Logan"" and his beautiful actor partner ""Wheeler.""
I wish they would be able to get even a year or two with Goren and Eames (at least those two) and put them on special assignment in special investigations, etc, on the SVU show and get them involved now and then with Mariska Hagerty and Ice T and the team....I just hate seeing them go...BUT, thank goodness we have the DVD'S and re-runs.
Last, I did like very much how the 10th season ended with Eames looking like the beautiful Doll she is, arms crossed waiting for Bobby to come out, get on to the next case. My own made up ending is that though we do not see it, they end up married for this closeness they have come to have in near death and other on the job experiences they had, their trust and friendship has to materialize into more. Recall fans, how in a recent episode of SVU when Kathryn Erbe is talking at end of story with Mariska Hargitay about Goren, her partner, that she had for 10 years and it was like they were married? Hargitay then says to her, ""But you were not.""
...COME ON NBC, put them together for a few shows on SVU at least and give us at least the inclination that they are definitely going to be ""together?""  One good show would be them going out dating, going to Eamse' fathers home (who likes Goren we know.)

5444822,5,B00AJXO56I,"I loved the series Criminal Intent, and was sad to read and discover that this is the final DVD. I thought that Vincent D'Onoffio was brilliant as Robert Goren.",1368489600,,160,4.551724137931035
5444823,5,B00AJXO56I,If you are a fan of the show you should have the final season. The expected good story lines and acting. Sorry that there won't be any more seasons!,1368316800,,148,4.137931034482759

5444825,5,B00AJXO56I,So glad this came out.  I love Vincent D'Onofrio - what an actor - I wish he did not leave Law & Order,1366934400,,102,3.4347826086956523
5444826,5,B00AJXO56I,D'Onofrio and Erbe and great and never change.  This is my absolute favorite TV series that keeps me enthralled every minute I am watching it.  It is intelligently written and played and the quality has not changed over the years.  They are wonderful actors and the writers are very good and have seemed to stay interested in writing the series.,1366156800,,345,4.716666666666667
5444827,5,B00AJXO56I,"I have watched every episode since the beginning, I loved following the clues and listening to the witness statements. D'Onofrio and Erbe are the best. I wished they would come back.",1365465600,,182,4.903225806451613
5444828,3,B00AJXO56I,The ending I remembered is not what was the last episode on the DVD.  She was asked to be captian so she could fire him is what I remembered.,1365379200,,141,3.8620689655172415
5444829,5,B00AJXO56I,"I really enjoyed this final(?) season of L&O CI even if it was only 8 episodes. What I enjoyed most was watching Vincent D'Onofrio in therapy with the shrink his bosses send him too played by Lena Olin. Last season just got too far away from what worked best on this show; the chemistry between Eames & Goren and they brought in Jeff Goldblum and Soffia Burrows as a new detective team so we didn't see enough of Goren & Eames. In this final season Vince D'Onofrio seems to 'come alive' with energy for the role like he hadn't had for some time in my view. When the end comes and we see how Goren finally see his partner Eames in a 'new way' These two lonely, wounded, souls who obviously care very much for each other might find something more--together. I found that to be a perfect way to close the series but also leave the door open if they ever wanted to restart the show.",1364860800,4,878,4.263473053892215
5444830,5,B00AJXO56I,I have collected all L & O CI and this one completed set.  One of my favorite programs on tv. Would recommend to friends.,1364515200,10,121,4.041666666666667
5444831,1,B00AJXO56I,"I thought as most people the last season of CI would have something special.  WRONG, it appeared to me as if no one wanted to be doing what they were doing.  Kind of like just going through the motions.  The story line was fine, just tired.

Look how long the season was, half of what it should have been. I know the lead actor was sick and he looked like it.  Still, there are many other ways to end a good series, then just stopping it as if tomorrow we will be back at work.

NOT Worth the money.....",1364342400,2,503,4.03030303030303
5444832,5,B00AJXO56I,"Thank the squirrels for the return of Goran and Eames-no Captains or DA's-just 2 cops doing what they do best-solving crimes. They've always played so well against each other-Eames more ""old school"" and Goran's ""alternative psych analysis"" with more than a fare share of geekdome. You gotta love a guy who's best investigating tool is his library card,and knows sharks don't swim up the Hudson-or as Eames may say ""here's something he found in his wheeties today!"" Never dull. So great to see the final 8 episodes-good storylines-good detective work and then.., it was all over. The fact that Eames is waiting on Goran at the closing scene-his,truely must trusted companion through it all-and off they ride into the sunlight to solve another crime. I don't know why this was cancelled-if the writers could still produce stories of this caliber - why not continue?? I'm so glad it ended on a high. The season 9 Jeff Goldblum debacle with the dodgy ""what the hell is going on?""story lines were more than I could bear-it was just crazy. Long live Goran and Eames-maybe he'll join her on SVU for a stint? I hope so. Highly highly recommended",1364256000,39,1137,4.8061224489795915
