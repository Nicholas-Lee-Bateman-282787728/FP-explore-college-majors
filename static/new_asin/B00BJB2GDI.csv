There were two different scenes that REALLY bugged me about this film and it was the corpses hanging, not that they were hanging but, that they were so decomposed they were unidentifiable and, still had their full heads of natural colored hair.  This film was VERY slow, it was more of a goosebumps ghost story than anything, nothing more than an odd love circle.  The strongest performances were Brad Dourif and Sarah Steele.  The film was not low quality like most indie films, but I wish they could have thrown some of that money at the story rather than the equipment.",1369958400,,701,4.576

5634933,5,B00BJB2GDI,"**I received a screener copy of this movie for review; I am not being compensated for this review.
I have to be honest:  I had never heard of LAST KIND WORDS before I found it in my mailbox.  But sometimes, that is the best way to watch a film...if you go into it with no prior knowledge, then you won't take any preconceived notions with you.  That's exactly what I did with this film; I didn't even read the cover or the press release before I watched it.  And I'm glad, too...this is an excellent film, and it was a nice surprise!

This film is striking on several levels.  It is visually appealing, the acting is superb, and the story itself is riveting and original.  You really can't ask for much more in a movie.

LAST KIND WORDS is shot very well, and I have to tip my hat to the cinematographer.  There are many haunting shots in this film, and they add greatly to the suspense and the drama.  I would even go so far as to say it is some of the best cinematography I've seen this year.

The film has a simplistic feel to it, which is as it should be for a rural Kentucky setting.  But it also has a bleak and vivid sense to it as well; Eli's family life is less than desirable thanks to his father, and this enlivens the drama amidst the tension of the plot.

The story of LAST KIND WORDS is the true winner in the film for me, however.  It is a unique ghost story of sorts, and it's final images will linger in your mind for a while after the credits roll.  I particularly like how we, as the audience, realize things are not as they seem...but in a different manner than expected.  This is very good storytelling.

If I were forced to find a negative with this film, I don't think I could.  It looks great, it's made well, and it entertains.  This is truly a fun and chilling film.  It hits shelves next week, so make a note to give it a look.",1368748800,22,1854,4.140056022408964

5634935,2,B00BJB2GDI,"It's been said that when you get to the heart of evil, nothing is there. This movie is the cinematic equivalent for a ghost story: when you get to its heart, nothing is there. Put aside its inconsistencies (e.g., the bodies, supposedly ""deep in the woods"" are just a hop, skip and jump over the backyard fence). Put aside its head-scratching attempts at plot twists (e.g., having Waylon SPOILER ALERT kill himself at the end even though Amanda has already disappeared). Bottom line, the movie just doesn't deliver, not chills, not dread, not shocks, not...anything.",1378857600,,565,4.957894736842105
5634936,4,B00BJB2GDI,"Last Kind Words (Kevin Barker, 2012)

When I saw this flick up for grabs on Netflix while I was trolling the ""Popular on Netflix"" queue a couple of weeks ago (I am not ashamed to admit I do this at least once a month), I added it on the off chance that some indie director had taken a crack at adapting a Tom Piccirilli novel to the screen, something that is way overdue. I did so even though I know that any film adaptation of Piccirilli's work would probably not even come close to the original, though I imagine the noir stuff like The Last Kind Words would be easier to adapt than the crazy Southern gothic stuff of his I like even better (A Choir of Ill Children is not only my favorite Piccirilli novel, it is one of my favorite books of all time). And I figured, hey, if it's not Piccirilli, and it's just another DTV picture, what's the most I've got to lose, an hour and a half of a work-from-home Tuesday when I could be watching another equally crappy DTV movie? I tell you all this to give you an idea of the mindset I was in when I hit play on Last Kind Words. I wasn't expecting much, and I hate to admit that as soon as I saw Brad Dourif, I was expecting even less. I love Brad Dourif, always have, but man, it is hard to get the stink of Fading of the Cries out of your head, you know? And so to say Last Kind Words blindsided me would be something of an understatement. But it does make this review quite a bit easier to write, because it gives me a point of comparison. I have a (very) short shelf of the DTV horror flicks that, for my money, should have gotten theatrical releases, because they're a damn sight better than pretty much any horror film that's been turned out by Hollywood in the past decade. Cube is, of course, the one everyone is familiar with, but most horror geeks have probably seen Shallow Ground, DeadBirds, or Pony Trouble!. The real nerds have dug far enough in to have found perhaps the best treasures in the bunch, Baby Blues and Lockout. Now I'm adding Last Kind Words to that short shelf; it stands easily with any of the above. And for the love of Johnson County, it's good to have the old Brad Dourif back!

Plot: Bud (Pirates of Silicon Valley's Clay Wilcox), his wife Ida (Stake Land's Marianne Hagan), and his son Eli (Star Trek's Spencer Daniels) have moved back to Bud's rural Kentucky hometown in the wake of some sort of personal shake-up (possibly Bud losing his job, but if it is ever explicitly stated, I don't remember), going to work for Bud's old next-door neighbor Waylon (Dourif). Eli, being teenaged and footloose, is less than thrilled with the arrangement until, while wandering in the woods near Waylon's place, he comes upon Amanda (Repeaters' Alexia Fast), tall, willowy, blonde/redhead, and all the sudden the backwoods are waaaaaaaaay more interesting...even though Eli left a raven-haired love (Please Give beauty Sarah Steele) back in the city. And as if throwing a love triangle into the mix isn't enough, Eli's wandering through the woods starts uncovering more rural Kentucky secrets--things that the locals would rather have stay buried. And to top it all off, it seems that (a) Eli may be replaying some years-earlier drama involving Bud and Waylon, and (b) Waylon is in hock up to his ears to the local loanshark, Mr. Peterson (Hit Me's Rich Williams), who's getting mighty impatient.

And you know, I didn't realize it until I started writing that plot synopsis, but we kinda did get a Tom Piccirilli Southern gothic movie here. I wouldn't characterize it as horror in any sense; it is more of that kind-of-indefinable ""supernatural drama"" genre that Asian film industries do so well (Japan, India, and Hong Kong, especially) with a couple of mysteries mixed in beneath the surface. But the real draw, at least for me, ended up being the romance angle, once the city girlfriend was introduced; Barker, adapting a story by Amy Riherd Miller, miffed the plotline a couple of times (he was, erm, less than subtle in the scene where Eli realizes he's in a situation where he probably has to choose, and then, while the ultimate resolution of the love-triangle subplot is all too realistic, and very powerfully shot--for which I should be giving him props, no?--it still feels as if there should have been one more scene there. Even though there probably shouldn't. Watch the movie and see for yourself), but it really stood out for the realism and tenderness with which Barker handled the material. Which carried over into the rest of the movie, really, though how much realism one can reasonably inject into what is, at its heart, a simple ghost story is questionable. That just makes this movie all the more impressive.

I think I just talked myself into kicking the rating I originally gave this movie up half a star. Which doesn't sound like much, but to put it in perspective, three-and-a-half star movies are not automatically entered onto my thousand-best list (as of this writing--August 9, 2013--my spreadsheet lists 690 titles to which I've given three and a half stars; 284 of them are on the thousand-best list). Four-star movies are. That's the most important half a star in my movie-ranking hierarchy, when it comes right down to it, and the more I think about the little details in this movie, the more I think it deserves it. This is very, very good stuff, and it deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. See it sooner rather than later. ****",1377561600,3,5445,4.593011305241521
5634937,5,B00BJB2GDI,I was surprised at how moving this movie was. It's slow to progress but worth the wait at the end. Characters have depth and color. A love story/ ghost story combined. Bitter sweet.,1377475200,2,181,4.515151515151516

5634939,3,B00BJB2GDI,"Horror movies are a go-to genre for up and coming film makers. They can be inexpensive to make and easily recover their production costs. But too many of them go for the big kill and never rise above the fray. ""Last Kind Words"" is a quieter, Southern Gothic type outing more concerned with nuance than impact but is so loose it almost dissipates before our eyes.

Here's the scoop. Eli moves, with his mom and dad, to a trailer on his uncle's farm, in rural Kentucky, because dad has lost his job. Uncle (a not so creepy Brad Dourif) isn't doing well himself. He's two weeks away from foreclosure. Anyway....Eli becomes infatuated with a local gal which leads to a myriad problems that play out to a sad ending.

This is writer/director Kevin Barker's first feature film, and, though there are some good ideas here, he just couldn't pull it off. I like the quiet menace of the film. It's shot well but without pizzazz so it has a natural feel to it which adds to that menace. For my money there was too much going on here. It's as though Barker didn't have enough core story going on and fleshed it out with things that didn't add to the story and were left unresolved. He couldn't bring the core elements together in a powerful enough way. I'd like to applaud that he tried some unconventional points in the plotting but I can't say they worked. Originality is no virtue in its own right. And I can't say I believed it. The story just didn't make enough sense at any level and there is no way I bought into the way it ended.

I wanted to like this film, and I did like certain things as they happened. But, at the end of the day, it just wasn't that good.",1374710400,3,1656,4.335483870967742
5634940,2,B00BJB2GDI,"I spent 3-1/2 years in Kentucky one day. This feels like it. On and on and on and on... In theory, this could have dragged more, but in practice it would have taken a deliberate effort. No atmosphere to speak of outside of languid Southern boredom, and damn near a complete lack of action. What little plot there is advances slower than social progress in Dixie, so I guess in that respect it fits. I kept watching, however, hoping for a pay-off. Should have known better. $3.99 and 90 minutes wasted.",1374624000,2,501,4.516483516483516
5634941,2,B00BJB2GDI,"The movie had potential. Alexia Fast is compelling as Amanda. The cinematography is beautiful. The concept was interesting. Unfortunately, the story writing was very self indulgent, maybe the expression of one's imagination with zero appreciation for the audience, or any idea how to make the concept they imagined into a watchable film.

The male lead was incredibly dull, hard to tell if it's the actor or the character, but he sets the tone for a meandering, droll affair that only has any life at all when the character of Amanda is on screen. Even here, though, the film never really makes proper use of potential to produce a worthwhile payoff. Remove those scenes and this film is a complete snooze fest.

Don't expect any thrills, scares or chills. There is a small amount of creepy and a supernatural element, but the film never achieves anything you look for in any sub-genre of horror. Where most good horror films provide a roller coaster ride, this film is more like a very boring Sunday drive through endless miles of a flat, featureless landscape.

I want to see more of Alexia Fast, hopefully in much better films, but beyond discovering this actress I feel this film was an absolute waste of my time and, more sadly, a horrible waste of a promising concept.",1374451200,2,1274,4.781818181818182

5634943,4,B00BJB2GDI,"Image Entertainment always gives independent filmmakers an outlet to get their projects out to the masses. Many of these movies fall into the extremely competitive genre of horror and suffer from collapsing into the realm of clich. ""Last Kind Words"" is one of the rare exceptions to this unfortunate trend.

17-year-old Eli (Spencer Daniels) and his family move to the Kentucky backwoods after the father (Clay Wilcox) loses his job. He decides to work on the secluded farm of a childhood friend and recluse (Brad Dourif). Upon exploring the woods near his new home, he meets a girl named Amanda (Alexia Fast) and feels an instant connection to her. His journeys also expose him to a dark secret the dead want restitution for from beyond the grave.

It's always a treat when you put in a movie expecting nothing more than a one-dimensional horror yarn but you get so much more. Looking at the cover of ""Last Kind Words,"" you'd think it was just another typical angry ghost flick. Instead, Director / Screenwriter Kevin Barker and Storywriter Amy Riherd Miller fashioned a touching feature that takes a coming-of-age tale and gives it more depth by combining it with an old-fashioned Southern gothic ghost story. It keeps the viewer's interest and slowly leads them to the answers to their own queries without losing any potency along the way.

The acting in independent or low-budget films can be questionable at times. That's not the case with ""Last Kind Words."" You can tell every actor in the movie was dedicated to the film and put their best foot forward. Brad Dourif completely embraces his role as the enigmatic hermit and landowner. Spencer Daniels commands every scene he's in. You can see the emotional depth he invested in the role in his eyes. Alexia Fast is passionate as the character of the mysterious and tragic Amanda.

""Last Kind Words"" is only available in a regular DVD format. Those looking for a high-definition experience will find this disappointing. While we're addressing unsatisfactory elements of this release, I find it necessary to comment on the lack of special features. This is an independent movie made by filmmakers hungry to tell their stories. I refuse to believe that Director / Screenwriter Kevin Barker and Storywriter Amy Riherd Miller weren't willing to do feature commentary or at least put together a short ""Making of"" featurette.

I have a hard time using the term ""horror movie"" to describe ""Last Kind Words."" There's so much more to it than the usual jump scares we're used to getting these days. While the film does provide adequate thrills and chills, they're accompanied and spread throughout a grievous tale of isolationism, selfishness, loss, and the quest for closure.",1373500800,2,2721,4.9714285714285715
5634944,3,B00BJB2GDI,"This is an oddball ghost story, one that is neither scary or overly entertaining. The film opens with a scene of a boy shooting his father because of what appears to be a ghost. We then flash forward. Eli (Spencer Daniels) is a teen. When his abusive Pa (Clay Wilcox) loses his job at the factory he moves to the farm of his childhood friend Waylon (Brad Dourif) which is apparently in Kentucky. Here Eli meets Amanda (Alexia Fast) who we become immediately suspect. Eli is also visited by his girlfriend Katie (Sarah Steele) while developing feelings for Amanda.

What we don't know is how the opening scene relates to the current situation. In fact I guessed wrong and was confused for much of the film which unravels itself slowly like a good mystery. It is perhaps my own fault as I was expecting a horror story from the cover and not a mystery/drama.

The acting was good. The plot was acceptable. The construction of the tale and lack of character build-up needed work.

Great acting by Brad Dourif (who is such a fantastic actor) and  the boy and girl, who star in most of the film. The scenery of the film was fantastic, A old tobacco plantation and deep foreboding cemetery.  A little bit of everything was in this film, drama, romance, history, suspense, and undying love. the love between the two of them is very well portrayed, and quite convincing.  just wonder if there were a longer version of this film that may exist that would answer some questions about the film. The last 10 min. of the film showed the girl being pulled away from the boy she loves by tree roots and then she is accosted by the roots. was the action of the roots the previous actions of the landower's love and/or rape of the girl? Were the landowner and girl... brother and sister, and did the boy's father have an affair with the deceased girl, and could they both have been brother and sister?

5634953,4,B00BJB2GDI,"""Last Kind Words"" is sort of an old-fashioned ghost story, set in a poor rural area of Kentucky.  It's rather refreshing as it's mostly just normal, regular people, not the usual pretty-boy & pretty-girl cast with big SUV's, and not a single cell phone (with no reception) to be found.  A teenage boy moves with his parents to live in a trailer & do work for the father's childhood friend after the father loses his factory job.  Young Eli discovers a young girl named Amanda on the property, and she is as mysterious as she is beautiful.  Now, the father's childhood friend, Waylon, certainly knows who Amanda is and warns Eli to keep away, but things are not good with Eli & his dad, so naturally Eli is drawn to find something else to do with his time than hang around his folks.  And of course, Amanda is not what she seems but neither is Waylon.

There are a few plot holes but nothing too serious, and the locations are appropriately eerie without too much effort.  This is not a fast-paced film so it would not be appreciated by the slice & dice crowd, but anyone that enjoys a decent ghost story will appreciate it.

Last Kind Words is a slow-moving, low energy supernatural thriller that never engages the viewer.  The plot is predictable and doesnt try to hide it.  On top of that its just plain silly and loaded with padding that makes it seem even longer than 87 minutes.  A sub-plot with Elis old girlfriend sneaking out from the city to visit him is a prime example of an added plot threat that serves no purpose other than to up the running time.

The acting is also substandard by everyone involved including the veteran Douriff.  I know he has specialized in these off-kilter roles for decades but just when you thought he might have a chance to play a more normal role, he makes the predicted turn to bat-crap crazy.  Spencer Daniels who plays Eli, is an experienced young actor with a cherub-like face but he doesnt have the mettle to carry the bulk of the film as he is being asked to do.",1438387200,,1849,4.494011976047904
8569458,4,B00BJB2GDI,"Last Kind Words is a reflective, atmospheric film rich in character and drama. It is not a typical horror movie, and in fact horror fans attracted by the promotional art may be disappointed at the lack of gore or special effects.

The story begins when young Eli's parents move to an isolated farm to begin a new life. Eli's father drinks too much and is haunted by a memory that won't let go of him. Bored and restless, Eli goes for long walks in the nearby woods in search of peace. There he meets Amanda, a pretty young girl that Eli quickly takes to. But the farm's owner warns Eli that Amanda is dangerous. What kind of danger lurks within the forest, and what secrets wait for Eli to discover them? This is a somber, sometimes deceptively quiet movie that works because of traditional movie-making elements that are well-executed from beginning to end. Direction is unobtrusive but well balanced, and the acting from the small cast (primarily Eli and his parents and Amanda, with Brad Dourif as the only ""name"" actor as the reclusive farmer) is for the most part quite good, though it's no surprise the benchmark performance goes to Dourif. The script makes sense, unlike some genre screenplays which throw logic to the winds and hope nobody cares, and in the end you understand why everything turns out the way it does. The Kentucky setting is evocative and the simple country setting is not only picturesque but at times eerie and disconcerting.

Though not the horror movie some who approach this film may be expecting, Last Kind Words is in fact much better than most low-budget productions of whatever genre. Sensitive, touching, and yet creepy in its subtle way, Last Kind Words will entertain you while you watch it and linger in your mind's eye for some time thereafter.",1438041600,,1784,4.733118971061093
