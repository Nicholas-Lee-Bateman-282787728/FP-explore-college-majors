It was hard for me to watch and a waste of Lea Thompson and Tim Robbins acting skills. I can't believe that didn't just absolutely kill Robbins career.

Talon: I was told I was watching a super hero movie produced by George Lucas so my expectations were really high. I was in for an action-packed quest with quotable characters and detailed special effects.

Joe: That should teach you. Never hope for anything. Life is a series of endless disappointments sporadically interrupted by a catastrophe.

HOWARD THE DUCK was one of the catastrophes.

Talon: H.T.D blew my mind. This was an actual movie. People had to put in hundreds of hours, millions of dollars, thousands of takes, to create a final product.

It must suck to get panned by critics, and viewers, and get ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even though a lot of it was unbearable, I still saw all the heart and effort put into it.

Joe: A lot of talented, optimistic people worked hard on this. It's tragic.

You hear all of these stories of Hollywood execs visiting the set, overriding the director, demanding reshoots.

Here's one movie where that was desperately needed, but it apparently didn't happen.

Talon: And it had a budget of 36 million.

Joe: There are so many better things they could have done with that money. Like set it on fire.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""It'd be funnier if Howard got tortured to death.""
""I feel like I'm being tortured to death.""

""I want my money back and I didn't even buy it.""

Howard the duck says,""Talk about a rotten day.""
More like, ""Talk about a rotten movie.""

""I'm really, really hoping Howard has sex with Beverly.""

Now for the bad puns.

""Hey look, Beverly's feeling down.""

""Howard's on a bad pluck streak.""

""Add that to Howard's bill.""

""Remember that fight scene?""
""Yeah?""
""He winged it.""",1484524800,2,2156,5.495440729483283

222852,3,6300185788,"This is a Product review of the BLU-RAY Release, and not of the actual film content.

I've loved Howard the Duck ever since I saw it as a kid back in the 80s when it came out on VHS. I had the pleasure of meeting Lea Thompson and Ed Gale (the man who played Howard the Duck) at a convention. Then I had the rare opportunity to see it in an actual movie theater on 35mm Film for its 20th Anniversary. So why the 3-stars? Because this is just another Blu-Ray Up-Converted from the DVD source.

I compared the Blu-Ray with my 2009 DVD release, and have confirmed that it's the same transfer and not a new High Definition scan. It always puzzles me why they do this, surely the original scan was done in 2k and then mastered down to DVD. But there's no extra detail in things like those fantastic 80s sweaters, hair and fishnet stockings. Having seen this projected on film, I knew the details I was missing (and what I was hoping to see) on the Blu-Ray. What you do get is a LOT of artificial edge enhancement and DNR.

While people always rave about the 5.1 Remixed soundtracks on these re-released classics, another thing that puzzles me is why they never include the ORIGINAL sound mix. Again, having seen this in a theater in Dolby Stereo (4.0) the new sound mix almost sounded ""forced"" and ""artificial"" whereas the theatrical mix relied more on the actual Left and Right speakers for the bass and sounded more natural.
Or heck, why not just take the 6.0 mix from the 70mm release and use THAT for the 5.1 soundtrack? Just give us what's already there. (I'm still appalled that Universal re-mixed Jurassic Park... which WON AN ACADEMY AWARD for its original sound mix! And we don't even have that mix on DVD or Blu-Ray. Thanks.)

So if you've already got this on DVD (Or LaserDisc), skip this Blu-Ray release.",1482192000,9,1810,4.459214501510574

222880,5,6300185788,"It's a classic!! In this film based on the comic book character, Howard the Duck is suddenly beamed from Duckworld, a planet of intelligent ducks with arms and legs, to Earth, where he lands in Cleveland. There he saves rocker Beverly (Lea Thompson) from thugs and forms a friendship with her. She introduces him to Phil (Tim Robbins), who works at a lab with scientist Dr. Jenning (Jeffrey Jones). When the doctor attempts to return Howard to his world, Jenning instead transfers an evil spirit into his own body.

Wikipedia says:

Twenty-seven-year-old Howard the Duck lives on Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth, but inhabited by anthropomorphic ducks and orbited by twin moons. As he is reading the latest issue of Playduck magazine, his armchair begins to quake violently and propels him out of his apartment building and into outer space; Howard eventually lands on Earth, in Cleveland, Ohio. Upon arriving, Howard encounters a woman being attacked by thugs. He defeats them using a unique style of martial arts. After the thugs flee, the woman introduces herself as Beverly Switzler, and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night. The following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumbertt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a janitor, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa. Because of unfair treatment, Howard quits and rejoins Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager, and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard is victorious.

Howard rejoins Beverly backstage after the band's performance and accompanies her back to her apartment, where Beverly persuades him to be the band's new manager. The two begin to flirt, but soon after that they are interrupted by Blumburtt and two of his colleagues, who reveal that a dimensional-jumping device they were inventing was aimed at Howard's planet and transported him to Earth when it was activated. They theorize that Howard can be sent back to his world through a reversal of this same process. Upon their arrival at the laboratory, the device malfunctions when it is activated, raising the possibility of something else being transported to Earth. At this point, Dr. Walter Jenning is possessed by a life form from another alternate dimension. When they visit a diner, the creature introduces himself as a ""Dark Overlord of the Universe"" and demonstrates his developing mental powers by destroying table utensils and condiments. A fight ensues when a group of truckers in the diner begins to insult Howard. Howard is captured and is almost killed by the diner chef, but the Dark Overlord destroys the diner and escapes with Beverly.

Howard locates Phil, who is arrested for his presence at the laboratory with no security clearance. After they escape, they discover an ultralight aircraft, which they use to search for the Dark Overlord and Beverly. At the laboratory, the Dark Overlord ties Beverly down to a metal bed and plans to transfer another one of his kind into her body with the dimension machine. Howard and Phil arrive and apparently destroy the Dark Overlord with an experimental ""neutron disintegrator"" laser, which has only been forced out of Jenning's body. The Dark Overlord reveals his true form at this point. Howard fires the neutron disintegrator at the hideous beast, obliterating the creature, and destroys the dimension machine, preventing more creatures from arriving on Earth, but also ruining Howard's only chance of returning to his planet. Howard then becomes Beverly's manager, hires Phil as an employee on her tour, and plays guitar with Beverly on stage.

222901,5,6300185788,"I've always had a soft spot for Howard the Duck. Much maligned by reviewers and moviegoers alike, I caught after it went into rotation on the premium cable channels (yes, that's right, back then people were paying a monthly subscription fee for a channel that showed them Howard the Duck; the irony is not lost on me). It's not Howard the Duck of the comics, but it still has its charms. Yes, yes, an anthromorphic duck is playing the horndog next to a young Lea Thompson; but, really, who wouldn't? If you can accept the concept that a planet of anthromorphic ducks exist then the rest just follows along. It all culminates with the wonderful ending music sequence which Lea Thompson actually sings in and features the greatest of all 80s musical instruments, a keytar.

If remade today Howard would be all razor-sharp-focused CGI and politically corrected him to death, but this was the 80s and they used an actual suit with actual people inside (several; the list of actors who wore the costume is impressive) with SFX people off camera controlling all the facial expressions. That even a smidge of the cartoon survived to the screen is impressive given that around this time Hollywood execs had reached their fill of allowing directors to dictate to them what is and isn't good, and were instead determined to meddle with as many films as possible, leading to the death spiral that is the modern studio movie.

The transfer seems good, far better than the last copy I had on (yes, I know) VHS. It could be remastered to clean up the image quality but, really, a decent transfer is just about all HTD is going to get.",1471996800,,1620,4.660839160839161

222996,3,6300185788,"It's a shame this movie has not gotten any respect due to the horribly distracting duck suit. The supporting cast is good and the story is solid, based on source material written by Howard's creator Steve Gerber. The bad duck suit just made it too hard to focus on the underlying story. If you can get past the suit, the film is quite entertaining.

A few years back, George Lucas stated in an interview that, if he could do anything over, he would love to revisit Howard the Duck and, using current technology, digitally remove the guy in the duck suit and replace him with a fully CGI duck. Following the unexpectedly positive fan reaction to the brief appearance of Howard in the post-credits scene in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", this seems a perfect opportunity for Disney/Marvel to ride the wave and release a ""new"" Howard the Duck solo movie with minimal production cost (a few million for a fresh CGI duck and overall remastering). For a relatively small investment, they could probably rake in a decent box office from new fans wanting to see more of ""the talking duck from Guardians"", as well as older fans yearning to see the movie done right with technology that has finally caught up with the ambition.",1463356800,9,1213,4.668224299065421

223035,4,6300185788,"Let me tell you something about film critics. It's easy to pick faults in someone else's work, even if you do not have it in your power to create an equal work of art. The average film critic, by his very nature, is just a pretentious know-it-all who is quite frequently talking from the wrong end of his alimentary canal. When HTD came along in 1986 it was the first true victim to the pop culture critic. George Lucas was a juggernaut of filmmaking and there were many who want to see him fall.

For 30 years it has been called 'the biggest flop of all time' and other such terrible labels. Well, it cost $30 million dollars (nothing compared to today's budgets, inflation or no inflation) and took $37 million worldwide and that's not even counting the higher-than-you-think rental revenue. Add it altogether and HTD is most definitely NOT the flop it is accused of being. But since it was a rather eccentric (and occasionally raunchy) family comedy (an easy target) and one of the first films to significantly under-perform at the domestic box office (George Lucas expected the returns to be astronomical) it became a scapegoat for bad studio spending and taste.

I guess that the world needs something or someone to blame when pop culture goes wrong and the jackass critics I mentioned already seized upon Howard's failings to make a name for themselves. Derogatory soundbites are easy to come up with and everyone who hated the film used some kind of duck-themed insult to put it down and make themselves feel clever. But, when you think about it, these are basically the same people who will deliberately give a bad film a great review just to see their own name on the poster. You ever see a recent M. Night Shyamalan movie with quotations on the poster? They exist.

The film also suffered a further bad rep when George Lucas publicly disowned the film. It's under-performance forced him to sell off a part of his company which went on to become Pixar (think of how much he could have earned if he didn't) and it really made him quite angry. Wouldn't you be?  But I consider this a good thing as Lucas owning Pixar would have been disasterous. Howard's failure stopped Lucas from having too much power and I am happy with that.

I am a huge fan of the late Steve Gerber's comic-books. HTD was basically the first BIG comic-book movie and came surprisingly soon after he found success in his own series. Howard first appeared in an issue of Man-Thing and starred in a few other issues of Conan and even Spider-Man before Marvel gave him his own wings in the late 70s. The comic-book stories are the most surreal, archaic and satirical I have ever read and it's a shame that they had to tone it down for the movie, but that's to be expected.

As an ordinary duck working for an advertising company on his home planet of Duckworld, Howard is blasted across the universe right out of his living room by an experimental laser developed by Dr. Jenning (Jeffrey Jones). He lands in Cleveland, where he meets Beverly Switzler (a super-duper cute Lea Thompson) a rock singer who takes him under her wing...I mean arm. Now trapped in a world he never made the one attempt at sending him back home unleashes the forces of the Dark Overlord of the Universe on Earth through the possession of Dr. Jenning and he intends to bring more of his demons through the portal. Yeah, that sounds pretty heavy. (Weight has nothing to do with it)

I'm actually a sucker for duck-related stuff. I don't know why. Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Duckman etc. The list goes on and on. What I particularly like about the HTD movie is how most people seem to be completely at ease at talking to a humanoid bird and Howard himself is A-D-O-R-A-B-L-E.

Some of the fairer critics claimed that the film might have been a bigger hit if they had used CGI or traditional animation to bring Howard to life, but I must disagree. Part of the appeal of Howard is the fact that he is actually physically there and not some ghost who has been photo-shopped in afterwards. I love the duck suit, to me it is completely convincing and Chip Zien's voice work is perfect. I'd totally love to have Howard as a pal. The special effects are also a perfect mix of genuine stuntwork, optical fireworks from ILM, and outlandish stop-motion creatures courtesy of Phil Tippett.

No joke, this film has a unfairly notorious history and a totally wrong perception by the general public or those who turned their noses and beaks up when it came out in 1986. Clear your head of any preconceptions that you might have and enjoy it on its own level. Though we really could have done without that silly narration over the opening title.

The Blu-ray looks great in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 5.1 sound and a lot of good extras. Totally worth buying.",1461628800,5,4817,4.590697674418605

However, when someone is governed by God's objective morality (all but absent in today's upside down society) you will discern what will pass as family entertainment, and what passes as garbage- even if it is from a big named director.

This despite being a diehard Howard The Duck/Steve Gerber fan, dating back to my misspent youth in the '70s. So, yeah, I finally watched it -- or tried to -- and yes, this movie is way worse than you can imagine. So flat-out, totally misguided, misconceived and poorly produced that it doesn't even work as a so-good-it's-bad, nudge-nudge, wink-wink kitsch delight.  It's just bad.

A couple of thoughts, I'll keep it brief:

1)  Why would you do a film adaptation of Howard The Duck and have it get rated PG?

and

2) If you did get a PG rating, then why pack the film full of crass PG-13/R-ish sexual references, such as Howard ogling women's butts, etc.?  (Also worth mentioning: Howard the Comic Book Duck was not a creep. The movie version is.)

Also, Howard as a martial arts expert/action hero?  They did that in the comics, but as a joke. Here, it's just one more point in a long string of items where they got every single aspect of this character wrong. If you want '80s kitsch, there's lots better be to found.

This movie actually had good actors in it and it comes from the comic book series, marvels 'howard the duck'  which also had guest stars in it like the rock group kiss.  That version of howard had him as a cigar smoking foul tempered duck from a wierd animal planet.  This is the same except howard was not a bad ass mean duck and that would have been better.  And this one even has the infamous girl and duck sex scene with the hot lea thompson. Who is a very good actress but this movie hurt her career somewhat.  Which is a shame.  The movie however is a bomb, it's awkward and lucas did not understand what howard was about somewhat.  He would later take this lesson of cuteness and add the horrible jar jar binks into star wars.

223158,5,6300185788,"Howard The Duck is one of the 1980's miss understood creatures
It's not the best film of the decade of excess but, it's not the worst
The film was a massive gamble that didn't pay off at the box office so it was trashed (Then)
I'm sure more people rented this little gem on VHS and fell in love with it for what it is
Not what the Studio thought it was
It's very strange in the sense it walks a thin line between kid friendly to very strange adult humor
The could be why it never caught on during it's original theatrical run?
It has a rating of 4.5 on IMDB which is without a doubt underrated

The Cast is priceless:

Lea Thompson  (Beverly Switzler) Lea is incredible in every sense of the word  she helps sell everything going on!
Interesting trivia  Both Tori Amos and Phoebe Cates  auditioned for the part of Beverly Switzler, eventually played by Lea Thompson.
Jeffrey Jones  (Dr. Walter Jenning) Jones is such a gifted actor that usually makes every role his own
He also helps sell everything going on plus he has two very different roles and very good practical make-up through-out
Tim Robbins  (Phil Blumburtt) This is Tim Robbins first major film role and he's good at first your not sure what to think of him but, by the half way point he's just as important as Jones and Thompson
Chip Zien  did the voice of  Howard T. Duck  (perfect voice he brings life to the character!)
Ed Gale  (Howard) was in the suit did a amazing job

The look Howard is completely practical and looks simply amazing still to this day
This is the perfect argument how practical f/x will always outshine CGI
I'd go as far as saying that Howard looks better and more life like then E.T.
(And i was a massive E.T. fan as a kid!)
You also get a super early CGI in the forms of the Dark Overlords (These creatures look good at times other times the f/x looks really dated)

We in North America (Region A) finally get the blu ray of Howard the Duck
my biggest gripe with the blu ray out of the gate is the lack of the audio commentary that the UK Import has
I pre-ordered this version to replace my Special Edition dvd (but, now i have to double dip and get the UK Import too)
Thanks Universal
Howard the Duck still to this day isn't given nearly enough credit or respect for a fun comic book B Movie  9.5/10",1454457600,,2289,4.290697674418604

I liked the movie (I just needed to put down the stars to enter this comment) Howard the Duck was not intended to be an Oscar winner. It was intended to entertain. It did. It was a popular comic series. I don't care for George Lucas, but filmmakers are contracted to make movies for production companies. He made Rudy, while not my favorite the ""contract"" made him create this film. He may have very well not wanted to make that movie. With available resources he did what he could.

223512,3,6300185788,"'Howard the Duck' is not the best movie ever made, but it certainly isn't deserving of the abysmal reputation it has as one of the 50 worst films ever. On the contrary, it's an entertaining (although incredibly unrealistic) comedy-action film that has some of the best special effects seen in a film since before the CGI era. HtD is notorious for being the film that forced George Lucas to sell the fledgling computer animation divison of ILM to Apple, which would eventually become the ultra-successful Pixar.

'Howard the Duck' is an enjoyable film with a simple premise and great cast including Jeffery Jones, Lea Thompson (who didn't love her back then?), and a then unknown Tim Robbins who steals the show as the goofy scientist wannabe Phil. The comedy is hokey at times but manages to generate a laugh here and there, even after repeated viewings with some surprisingly effective scare moments that can be downright frightening for some, and although the fashion and music trends don't hold up, it is still a nice time capsule look at the day-glow synthesizer and Aqua Net soaked hair metal period of the mid 1980's.

All in all, definitely NOT one of the 50 worst films ever made (I can name more than 50 right now that are much, much worse), and it's a film that deserves much more praise than it has been given.",1418860800,2,1321,4.689655172413793

I don't know why critics are so hard on this film. Film directors should have some wiggle room to play around and not always be so serious. I find Howard The Duck to be a great science fiction film, loaded with adventure, and comedy. It doesn't take itself too serious and that's ok. Being an electric guitar rocking Mama myself I enjoy the girl rock band in the film and the songs are actually kind of cool! I may just have to do a cover of one of the songs. Many people don't realize this is a George Lucas film. For those unaware the creator of Star Wars!

The producers want you to take the idea of a walking and talking duck interacting with humans seriously and I must say the story was good. The film works because 'Howard the Duck' is thrust into our world, and his interactions with humans is good. At first, Howard is the Odd man out, 'Duck-out-of time' shall we say. but the film gives us a poignant love story, and that's what keeps our attention for the rest of the film. There is a great scene in this film where Howard flies an Ultralight plane over the streets of Cleveland, Ohio. It was really well done. The film uses lots of practical effects which I prefer. 'Howard' gets a chance to return to his home world via a ""Dimension machine"" in the films climactic ending, but I won't spoil the ending here. I bought this film. I liked this film.

Howard the Duck, is quite possibly the GREATEST movie of all time! Back in the 80s, we were just WAITING for something like this to come along. A Marvel Super hero movie, that was high quality, and live action! Oh, sure, we kept hearing about an upcoming live action X-Men movie... we would read about it in the Bullpen Bulletins since 1984... but we knew it wasn't going to happen. The X-Men? Far too obscure. Howard the Duck, however? Well, when we heard that George Lucas was producing, we just KNEW it would be movie gold, and we were NOT disappointed in the least.

Highly recommended. Watch it, especially if you are a Marvel fan!",1394064000,,662,4.554621848739496

I agree very much with another review that talks about two distinct feelings- the first half- and the second half... I like the first half much more now, as an adult than I'm sure I did as a kid. The first half is actually not that bad. The second half is a bad and silly cartoon for kids, very much so. I remember loving certain lines from the second half and liking the villain in the diner scene... Now as an adult or whatever I am- it's just too goofy and dumb. Don't get me wrong- it's still enjoyable- but maybe only if you've experienced it first as a child. The other thing I kept remaking on was the fact that's rated PG. I don't think PG13 would be out of order here. Lots of sex and drugs for a PG film. I'm no prude- I'm just saying that I'm surprised the prudes didn't get a PG13 on this one.

It must have been horrific as we've never seen that many cop cars go out there before!""  We laughed even more when we saw the movie when it came to that part.  Our kids loved it and now their kids love it.  I guess it is one that you either love it or you don't love it.

I think if you review this as an adult, you'll have much higher expectations for a movie..but as a child, you'll view it with less critical eyes and/or have a completely different understanding of what the movie is really about! For example -I thought Dirty Dancing was all about someone wanting to dance (missed the whole abortion cover up) and in Grease i thought it was just about high school and singing (missed the whole sexually charged attraction subplot). As a child we see the basics -and this was a great movie! As an adult, I wouldn't watch it unless wanting to reminisce.

224120,3,6300185788,"I don't know if this movie would have gotten as much attention as it did if it hadn't been known for being a horrible flop in the 80s. People either find reasons to justify hating it, or they have to stubbornly defend it and convince us that it is really a 5 star masterpiece despite its maligned reputation.

Well, I belong to neither camp. I think this is a decent 3 star popcorn chewer that you will enjoy if you don't take it seriously. It's a low budget sci fi film that is meant to entertain us, and it's not meant to be taken seriously.

Moving on, by a freak accident, Howard the Duck is transported from his own world to our world where he is first met with resistance and hatred. But he springs into action when he sees Lea Thompson being attacked. (He knows 'Duck Fu.')

They develop an uneasy friendship, and it suffers even more when Thompson thinks her 'marginal scientist' friend Phil can help. Howard then has the comical position of looking for a job, and yet another fight before Phil and his friends (including J. Jones) explain that maybe they can help him return home.

As our story goes on, we see the nice guy J. Jones gradually turn into a 'Dark Lord.' He is the 'undefined being' from Howard's planet who takes over J. Jones's body. (Like I said, this film was not meant to be taken seriously.)

There is a well done scene where we are allowed to cheer for the 'Dark Lord' as he takes care of some annoying and repulsive thugs.

The rest of the story seems to revolve around the Dark Lord kidnapping Thompson to help his buddies come to earth, and us wondering if the now reconciled Howard and Phil can save Thompson. (By the way, their rescue vehicle is a slip shot slapped together airplane. That is an airplane in the loosest sense of the word.)

In my opinion, the whole movie seems to be an excuse to get to the end musical video. (Kind of a catchy tune I confess.)

My advice is (1) Don't expect a masterpiece. (2) Don't take it seriously. (3) Accept that it's a low sci fi 2 hour popcorn chewer. (4) If this isn't a problem for you, just enjoy the film for what it is.

I'll conclude by saying, in all honesty, this film may be known as a major flop, but I've seen quite a few films that were much worse.",1316217600,3,2236,4.292161520190024

224125,5,6300185788,"""Howard The Duck"" is one of those films that were misunderstood and considered a waste of time and money, only because they were too advanced for the time when they came to light. If ""Howard The Duck"" would have been screened later, maybe it wouldn't have had such a bad critic. Now it's considered a classic must-see film. Many young viewers of nowadays love it, what reinforce the idea that it should have been done later. I always waited for a sequel in which Howard could go back to his own planet. I can't imagine him alone in this world, with no one more of his species nearby. It's too cruel! Maybe, like ""Tron"", another film advanced in time, ""Howard The Duck"" have a sequel, a legacy, almost 30 years after.

Talking about this DVD version, it's really a pity it doesn't have Spanish subtitles, especially in the extras. It has a Spanish language option for the main film, but, unfortunately, the translation was made in Spain, which is really very uncomfortable and not easy-listening for Latin-American Spanish speaking people. I leave the suggestion that the DVD characteristics should indicate if the Spanish translation is the Latin-American one.",1303776000,,1160,4.858585858585859

Now almost twenty-five years after its release you can look at Howard The Duck in a better light and take it for what it is, a fun, campy 80's movie.  The film stars Lea Thompson, Tim Robbins and Jeffery Jones and the three lead ""human"" characters seem to be having fun on screen with the midget in a duck suit (voiced by Chip Zien).

224170,3,6300185788,"Duck goes to Earth, Duck rocks out, Duck fails in the box-office; it's a quacked-up world we're living in.  ""Howard the Duck"" certainly isn't worth badmouthing.  Even with such a silly premise (even the director agreed on one of the special features), it does get the job done.  The cast are interesting in their own way.  Howard is pretty competent even if a bit of a jerk. Beverly (Lea Thomspon), while having VERY questionable taste in species love, tries to be supportive in her own way.  I do like Tim Robbins's character, if only because that character is out of his dang mind.  The story is alright, even if certain elements happened by coincidence or are simply disregarded like the cops after the chase sequence, and the special effects have that quality 80s look that I like so much.  If one can accept how mean-spirited and disturbing it can be (and honestly, nothing can be more disturbing than Ferris Buller's Principle dressing up like a pathological Emmett Brown using his tongue on a car lighter to drain electricity), this movie is worth the viewing time.

A heed warning for the white-bread families out there: ""Howard the Duck"" isn't rated PG by today's standards.  This is 1980s PG standards, where a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PG-rated/dp/B0014Z4ON4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PG rated</a>&nbsp;film can have a guy's heart pulled out and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-PG-rated/dp/B000P0J09W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a PG rated</a>&nbsp;film can have kids swear and discover corpses.  This film pushed that rating by its tail, even though a PG-13 rating has just been established.  Besides the grotesque monsters and the homicidal nature of humans wanting to maim or detain an anthropomorphic mallard, the movie sure went to the kinky side.  There's two scenes of humanoid duck nudity, Howard working in a provocative spa resort with a near-topless chick running across the screen, Howard checking up a badunkadunk of a large woman, Beverly finding a condom in Howard's wallet, and lest we forget the infamous bed scene with Beverly and Howard.  Nothing really happens in the latter, but there was plenty of foreplay and the Duck showed how happy he was; forget about wholesome families, that scene would just creep ANYONE up...except for the furries.

Oh, George Lucas, you can be pretty insane, sometimes.  This film does have that smell of cult fuming all over it.  It's a film critics hate, but some find joy.  I can't have a sense of nostalgia toward the film as I never saw it as a child, but it holds okay on its own.",1278201600,,2641,5.310096153846154

I was 8 years old at the time and I was visiting my Dad for the summer while he was stationed in Austin, Texas. Me and my Dad watched this movie one night. Yes, believe it or not Howard The Duck did actually come on TV in the eighties. In my opinion, this is one of the best movies of the 80's. It was a fast paced ride from beginning to end and it didn't take itself too seriously. To this day I still don't get why this movie was a flop and slammed so badly by critics and viewers alike. No, it wasn't Saving Private Ryan as another reviewer pointed out. Which was a long and boring movie anyway in my opinion. Howard the Duck had action, comedy, romance and horror. I can understand this movie not doing well now in 2010, but in 1986 this should have been a hit movie. Yea it was a little far fetched. I mean the main character was a talking duck. But this movie did and still does have a certain charm to it. That's probably why it's such a cult classic now. My theory for why it did so badly in the eighties was because one, people couldn't get past the idea of the main character being a talking humanoid duck. Two, you couldn't classify it into any one category because it had elements of all the movie genres and the eighties was big into labels. Many of the singers and groups out now would not have gotten past a demo tape in the eighties. Three, it was talked about so badly by the press that a lot of people didn't even give it a chance and see if they liked it themselves as opposed to taking someone else's opinion. Critics are harsh on movies anyway. Unless they're long and boring like Saving Private Ryan.

I thought that TIME would surely improve what I remembered as, well actually I barely had memories of the movie. The reason I did not have vivid memories of this movie is simply because it is rather FORGETABLE. I'm sorry I didn't really enjoy the movie. I like a lot of Tim Robbin's work. Lea Thompson was the delight of the movie. She is very, very sexy, and very, very pretty and so seemingly sweet. She was a delightful young woman back in the 80's. I enjoy her in movies from this time period. Anyway, the problem for me was that Howard, or Mr. Duck was not endearing, barely cute, the voice of Mr. Duck also didn't do much for me. I probably enjoyed the special features, or the RETROSPECT, of Howard The Duck more than the movie. I'm not SORRY that I purchased this DVD. On the level of sentiment I am glad to have a copy of the movie. However, as a fan of quality in films the script seemed to LACK quite a lot. The movie simply isn't FUNNY to me. I think Lea Thompson is quite a beauty. I also greatly appreciate the LABOR and SKILL involved in putting this project together. The idea of a little person in a duck outfit is novel. The idea of a duck person falling in love with a young woman/girl is novel. The idea of a super evil menace coming down in a laser beam though is just a bit too convenient and DUMB. I didn't care for the actor's portayal of the evil VILLIAN. I thought his EVIL ""VOICE"" was just DUMB. For me this movie was just LEANED more to the side of BORING and DUMB as opoossed to ENTERTAINING, FUNNY and SCAREY. I do think, however, that the BAND that Lea was in was quite an ACHIEVEMENT. I think it is really GREAT to KNOW that that is LEA THOMPSON SINGING. And I liked Howard's Guitar Solo. That was pretty GREAT as was the HOWARD the DUCK Song. Now if the rest of the film had only moved along with some sort of comedic or dramatic TENSION. The movie simply doesn't hold together well. There seems to be a problem with the FLOW of the PLOT. I guess MOST of the problem lies in how the characters were never ACTUALLY talking to the DUCK character. Howard's VOICE was OVERDUBBED and it really SHOWS in how the movie PLOT lacks COHESION and dramatic or comedic tension. There is a real lack of PRESENCE in the film.

224204,5,6300185788,"I really like the idea of a love story between a tough-yet-gentle earth girl, Beverly, and an alien who just happens to look like an Earth duck but who is just a regular guy on his planet.  You can sympathize with Howard's character--in one scene, Beverly hides him in a TRASH BAG- ""I just don't want people freaking out all over the place."" Howard-""What about me?  I'm gonna be in therapy for the rest of my life.""  (I love all his smart-aleck remarks.)  Despite this treatment, he comes to love her and when a new alien that really qualifies as a monster kidnaps her, he gets their friend Phil to help him rescue her, despite not having any way to fight other than knowing a bit of ""quack-fu"".  My personal favorite scene is where Howard and Philsie (as Howard dubs him) steal a tiny motor-powered hang-glider type airplane and have this hilariously wild flight with the cops shooting at them, despite neither of them knowing how to fly a plane!

I saw HTD at age 13, and liked it so much I went and bought the comic book series (even though I don't read comics), the bubblegum cards and then, years later, I discovered that the story had been continued (or had an alternate story; I can't remember now) in a set of 7 magazine-sized graphic-novel type issues, in black-and-white art.  I still have them.  In one, Beverly ends up going to Howard's world, where she is seen as the freak.

Bad reviews aside, HTD has always been, for me, a great combination of wacky humor, funky music, intriguing romance, creepy alien bad guys, and some of the best one-liners ever!",1260403200,,1566,4.544483985765124
224205,5,6300185788,"Long have I waited for this movie to come out on DVD and with extras to boot. I am not a big George Lucas fan and have never really cared for his Star Wars movies. Never was able to swollow that a Kansas farm boy is the long lost brother of British princess and the son of Ghengis Khan. When Howard came out I remembered a review with the heading 'George Lucas has laid an egg'. After a few promises from a friend who was a George Lucas fan, I watched it with him and was pleasantly surprised. It was an exceptional film, that was well paced, acted, and scripted. Don't be put off by the negative reviews of this film. George Lucas is the one of the most successful independant filmmakers of all time and the studios waited to pounce on something of his that was different enough to make a point. Still, after all this time, especially on YAHOO, critics like to beat up on this movie because they want to say that Lucas did make a bad movie. Even though I don't care for most of his stuff, Lucas has never made a bad film and like Speilburg, he won't. In the featurette, it is explained that they originally wanted to animate it, but Universal Studios had other ideas. Even though they had no choice but to put a man in a very elaborate duck suit, the effects hold up just as good or even better than anything else released at the time.

224206,4,6300185788,"Loosely based upon the Marvel Comics' character created by Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik, the film was directed by Willard Huyck and produced by George Lucas. Despite all the negative reviews this movie garnered back in the ""80's (mostly from the people whom were unconvinced to the look of the live-action puppet). I really thoroughly enjoyed watching this film on cable TV because; it had notable actors (Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones and Tim Robbins), pretty good special effects (the stop-motion animation), and some GREAT gags in my opinion (the scene from the diner is CLASSIC!).  Yet despite the film's flaws I do think it does suspend some belief to a point, what do you think?  What the movie had similar to the comic book series for me was the overall absurdity of predicaments Howard & Beverly's exploits would land them in, the eccentric characters, and the lampooning of 1980's pop-cultured society.  It's just too bad that back then CGI wasn't fully developed and at the advanced stage as it is today for films.  Maybe Howard the Duck would have achieved perhaps to say the least ""popular cult status""?",1255824000,,1120,4.91005291005291

When the movie came out, it had some great actors and it is wonderful to see them in slighly comedic roles due to the nature and background of Howard.  I thought the film was very true to the characters of the comic books.  I was sad that Howard did not run for President as he did in the comic books against Ford and Carter.  I still remember the headlines of 'Ford Cries Fowl' or the interviewed attempted assasign said ""I thought he was in season"".  A great film for those who remember Howard.  Now that Disney owns Marvel, hopefully Howard will replace Donald who has always been somewhat of a prima donna in my opinion.",1251676800,,669,4.354838709677419
224226,1,6300185788,"My boyfriend always used to tell me his favourite film was 'Howard the Duck'. ""I wish you could see it,"" he said. ""I saw it back in the 80s, and it's brilliant."" So when I noticed that 'Howard the Duck' had come out on DVD, I jumped at the chance to buy it for my boyfriend for his birthday. He could hardly wait to see it. His excitement was full-on. So I popped the movie in the DVD player and we sat down to watch it...

Soon after that, even before the film was halfway over, his apologies began. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I'm really very sorry. I remember it being better than this. I'm so sorry.""

In the storyline of the movie, Howard got sucked into our world from a parallel universe. Simultaneously, I got sucked into watching a very bad movie and losing two hours of my life which I'll never get back.

Every character in this movie was an idiotic, clumsy jerk, except maybe for the heroine of the piece, who was gorgeous yet inanely stupid. How the heck is anyone supposed to like a movie when all the characters are just so unlikeable? And the alleged plot defied my sensibilities, too. I just couldn't suspend disbelief and logic enough to believe that the events in the movie could ever have happened. Actually, I also couldn't suspend logic and disbelief enough to believe someone even made this movie, or that everyone involved in the making of it didn't change their name in the credits to 'Allan Smithee' or something, so they wouldn't have to take the blame for their work being so awful.

This movie was a total waste of a talented cast and crew, and I think that was the biggest shame of all. I blame the writer, who in a featurette on the DVD showed she was clearly still in denial about the complete trashiness of the movie when she talked about how she believed the movie only failed at the box office because it was ahead of its time, or the timing was wrong, or some such rot. I don't think she realised just how awful this film was, or that the reason why maybe some people are watching it now is for the same reason they watch old Ed Wood movies, because anything that infamously bad is going to arouse interest. Though I have to say, I would MUCH rather have been watching an Ed Wood movie than Howard the Duck. Actually, I would rather have been watching my own spleen being removed. It would have been less nauseating and painful.

I wish I had a time machine so I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy or watch this movie. Then again, perhaps I should have realised sooner how awful it would be after my boyfriend did the same thing in recommending the abysmal movie 'Young Doctors In Love' as being a brilliant movie, another faux pas he's still apologising profusely for. But I've learnt my lesson now -- he also recommended 'Joe Vs The Volcano', and I fully intend never to watch that one!",1250899200,4,2833,4.368121442125237

I would suggest you play this in either a DVD player that can upconvert to 1080P or a PS3 where the picture and sound quality is so much better because of the use of HDMI.

When we heard about the movie, no internet back then so just word in some movie mags, all of us fanboys were excited (remember this is a time with almost no movies based on comics).  A friend and I saw the movie and loved it, we came out of the theater sure that this was going to be a summer blockbuster.  Next day we read the reviews and overnight we saw the end of Howard the Duck's popularity.  Looked like my friend and I were the only 2 people in the world who liked the film.  Saw it on cable a while ago and I still liked it.  It's a fun silly movie based on a comic that was fun and silly.  Forget all the negatives and just enjoy it for what it is, a silly entertaining romp.

Later, Jenning takes Beverly as a hostage and Howard and Phil must save her before the Dark Overlord summons his friends and destroys all life on Earth. The special effects are awesome!

I usually get the impression that an A-list actor or director has fallen out of favor with some mogul who attempts to ambush his career by insuring that the gossip-columnist toadies who can influence theater goers who's empty minds are influenced by ""People"" magazine join in on the verbal fart chorus.  ""Howard the Duck"" was such a film.

A duck from a parallel earth where the waterfoul have a dominant civilization analogous to Mankind's here end up stranded on our planet.  A blend of some comedy and some sci-fi adventure, the plot revolving around an alien invasion of Earth is a little reminiscent of an old ""Doctor Who"" serial.  The lead acress is sexy, the soundtrack by Johm Barry is good if somewhat typical of him, the songs are acceptable.

Not a great film, by any means, but much better than 99 percent of the ""made for sci-fi network"" crap, this movie may be embarassingly 80-ish to some, but nowhere near to being deserving of the ""worst film of the 80s"" label, which could go to any number of politically correct, self-important rubbish of the same time period.

But if you can close your eyes and use the power of imagination to envision Howard as a real (in a manner of speaking) 'toon, the effect is kind of like ROGER RABBIT in reverse -- a 'toon in the mundane world, instead of a human detective in a cartoon world.  Other than that, the plot and characters are actually pretty reminiscent of their comic book roots.  George Lucas has spent millions of dollars ""refurbishing"" STAR WARS with unneccessary CGI effects ""upgrades"", so why not throw some of that cash around where it will actually do some good and digitally erase the midget-in-a-duck-suit and replace it with some good cel animation?  I know there are those who will violently disagree with this concept as either a complete waste of money, or that the man-in-suit low tech approach is what actually gives the film much of its campy charm.

Nor did producer George Lucas have to take the extraordinary step of disowning it.  Personally, I found it to be average summer fare, no worse than ""Men in Black II"" and as innocuous as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"".  The film's strongest moments come in it's first half and then kind of peters out with a series of elongated chase scenes and OK but nothing special FX.  The only thing that gave me pause was the film's PG rating.  There's a scene of Howard thumbing through ""Playduck"" and another where Lea Thompson discovers a condom in Howard's wallet.

But one miserable night he is accidently sucked up by a mysterious laser-beam from Earth as is sent to our world where he discovers that there are talking hairless apes. He falls in love with a beautiful singer named Beverly (Lea Thompson) but needs to find a way to get back to his planet, however a lab assistant named Phil (Tim Robbins)is willing to help him and a professor named Jennings (Jeffery Jones) gets invaded by an evil being from another galaxy for now Howard must save the world.

A entertaining adaptation of the cult Marvel Comics comes from executive producer George Lucas. This movie is known as one of the biggest box-office flops in history and has been critically panned yet it has retained a cult following over the years thanks to cable and video. Sure the story is silly sounding including the acting being bad especially some dialog but this movie is meant to be a goofy sci-fi comedy with a campy b-movie charm to it. Lea Thompson was very sexy in this movie especially in those hot pajamas that are almost revealing as it definitely would arouse a guy, i liked this movie since i was 4 in 1986 when i lived in St. Louis and my mom with dad took me to see this movie in a theater. I still love it as an adult for it's just a funny and exciting good time of a movie that shouldn't be taken seriously, it's just a guilty pleasure i likd.

For the first time this movie is finally avalible on DVD in the U.S. as this cult favorite deserves one as it's got some great extras like a handful of featurettes on how it became a labor of love turned into a box-office bomb panned by critics then became a cult phenomenon and of course teaser trailers.",1237507200,,1822,4.403560830860534

224346,4,6300185788,"This is a review for the 2009 American dvd special edition release.

This is one of the most well known, whether you've seen it or not, films of all time.  23 Years ago George Lucas was one of the hottest producer/writer/directors in Hollywood thanks to his involvement with the original Star Wars trilogy and Indiana Jones.  Everything he touched turned to gold.  He started his own sound and effects companies that revolutionised the business and the method in which films are made, and he still does that today.  Then came the infamous Howard The Duck.  Even when it was announced some were unsure why Lucas would gravitate to such an offbeat concept(originally an equally offbeat and satirical Marvel comic).  Then, the reports of the budget and reshoots(which thanks to this edition, you find out was due to the limitations of the original Howard puppet) had the skeptics reeling even more.  Every writer would make sure to note the huge budget of the film, as if it was relevant to anyone at all.  I notice some reviewers here on Amazon seem to use how much a film cost to deride it or how much it made to champion it, as if that says anything about the film itself.  Independence Day was and is a terrible film but it made a tons of money when it was released.  The true test of a good film or a film that trancends is time.

It's been over twenty years since Howard The Duck graced the silver screen and became one of the biggest and, apparently, most expenssive flops of all time.  Everyone seems to know this movie.  New generations who watched it on cable don't know a damn thing about the film's reviews or status back in the 80's and just take it for what it is: an extremely silly, farcical, goofy, sci-fi,fish out of water comedy, action adventure, horror movie.  I saw this when I was really young and even at that young age I still knew something of what a flop this flick was, that's how hardcore the criticism was.  Hell, there was an episode of Tiny Toon Adventures that had characters on the boxes in a video store coming to life, and one of them used the Howard The Duck video cassette as a bomb to stop an enemy(GET IT?!?!?  HA!HA!)

Well, I still dont' get why this film was hated so much.  I kind of get that it wasn't easily stuffed into convenient packaging.  Was it a kids film?  No, not really.  It contains too much sexual humor, and innuendo to be.  Was it a comedy?  Yes, but it had some sincere and scary moments.  Was it for an adult audience?  Sort of.  It was for anyone, but it seemed as though it would only appeal to those who feel like they're on the fringe of the norms in society.  They can relate to its take no prisoners, anything goes approach to filmmaking and storytelling.  That's the ticket.  That's why it's a cult film now.  An acquired taste produced to be a huge hit, but ended up only appealing to a small few.

The dvd itself is beautiful.  The transfer is pristine.  Surprisingly, the old-school effects hold up to the digital transfer.  Phill Tippet's stop motion monsters at the end still look cool and the digital clean up doesn't make them look as arcane as one might expect.  I've always thought John Barry's score was great.  It still is.  This film's score is one of the most memorable and creative, but due to the film's reputation it never got the kudos it deserves.  In one scene there's broad comedy and puns, and then a sweet scene between Howard and Lea Thompson, followed by the awkwardness of a romance between a duck and a human, which is all scored appropriately and it works.  There are two new featurettes on the disc.  One is a retrospective doc, running about a half hour, about the making of the film and its development.  We get the whole creative team of writer director Willard Huyck, writer/producer Gloria Katz(the writing team behind American Grafitti and Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom), actors Leah Thomson, Ed Gale(Howard), and Jeffrey Jones.  I think it's sooo cool that they all participated in this and weren't afraid to openly say that they liked the film.  There's a second featurette about the reaction to the film, it's reviews and box-office receipts.  This one is fun too and it incorporates all those interview in previous featurette.  Finally, we get the usual trailers and EPK materials from the film's original release.

I got this disc for 12 bucks.  If you like or love this film then it's a must.  If you're mildly interested or you love alternative cinema then it's a must as well.  If you are still a hater from back in the day, then why the hell would you be reading this anyway?

PS: Rewatching the film yesterday, I really started missing the stop-motion effects that all but disappeared back in the mid 90's.  The effects are so good, detailed, weighty, and other-worldly that I just smiled through the whole end sequence.  Sure, CGI has it's place for a lot of things it does great or brilliantly(Benjamin Button, Gladiator etc.) but when it comes to creature or monsters or aliens does it look any more real in CGI?  I don't know. I always know when I'm looking at something that's fully CGI and I know it's not really there.  I felt the same way about old school effects.  Gollum from the Lord of the Rings trilogy came closest in that regard,but that's about it.  Just something to ponder if you will....",1236816000,81,5323,4.538380651945321
224347,4,6300185788,"This is not a movie to take seriously.  This is a very funny satire on bad scifi films, and it stands well as just that.  The acting is decent, the story line is okay, the special effects are good and the overall impression is that it is a decent little movie.  However, a talking duck?  A planet where ducks evolved rather than monkeys?  Yeah....right....sure.  This is a fun way to spend an hour and a half, though.  Some good one liners, some good scenes, some serious laughs and a movie that the whole family can watch.  Does that sound all bad?",1236643200,3,549,4.366336633663367
224348,3,6300185788,"Apparently yes they did, as it is a fave of some reviewers here!  And I'm on that list.  This is a fun film, though clearly not a great one.  The creator (Steve Gerber) of HTD was ignored and had to sue to get the rights back.  If they had consulted him this film would be better.  The comic book was more satirical and Howard was less obnoxious in it.  And despite the description of the film here, there was a man (little person) in the costume,  That in my opinion was a mistake.  Having Howard be animated in a live action world would have made it much better as a film as Roger Rabbit proved a few years later.  Give it a try!",1236470400,10,631,4.065040650406504

YES, it's cheesy!
YES, it's 80's. VERY 80's...
YES, it's awkward!
YES, it probably wouldn't be deemed appropriate for children these days with various sexual references, etc.
YES, it's not one of George Lucas' best works.
But, YES I still love it anyway.

It's just that right blend of tongue-in-cheek humor, occasionally really bad acting (intentionally, I think), goofy special effects (hey, it was the 80's, give it a break)...

But, it's not for everyone, as one can tell from the various reviews hereabouts. People either seem to love it or hate it. Much the same way it was when it originally aired in theaters...

For some it's simply a guilty pleasure to watch something so horrendously bad...",1236297600,14,871,4.748344370860927

224391,5,6300185788,"Sure, it may not be the best movie ever. Not even close. BUT! This movie was one of my favorites as a child. Probably because of the swearing duck and the AWESOME music! I know a lot of people out there are groaning at this DVD Release, but I am giving out woo-hoo's of joy. I know a lot of people were disturbed by the relationship between Howard and Beverly, but it's not uncommon in comics where animals are closer to being human then their animal form. I own the HTD comics. If you've also read the TMNT original comics, you'll know that April marries one of the turtles! (I won't spoil the surprise) So let go of that ""bestiality"" crap and enjoy this for what it is. . .a cheesy 80's movie based on a comic book!",1235865600,,717,4.202898550724638
224392,4,6300185788,"The first thing that struck me was the DVD's cover art, and the fact that Howard's duck bill was missing it's ever present cigar.  Now this being a Lucas production (who we all know loves to screw with his film's content) and the current political correctness concerning smoking on T.V. and film, I was very nervous that I'd watch the film and find Howard's stogie had been digitally replaced with a walky-talky (a revised version of the film, E.T., reference :) or carrot, but alas, my fears were for not, as our fowl feathered friend has been allowed to keep his smokes (but in all reality, we only really ever see him smoke in about two scenes, the first time in an establishing shot, and secondly, to menace a bully).

So onto the meat and potatoes of the DVD, the extras, and I'm happy to announce that there are some pretty okay extras to be found here (although a commentary with the producer/writer, writer/director, Lea Tompson and Jeffery Jones, who look to have been recently interviewed for this DVD, and a music video for the song, Howard The Duck, for which I'm sure there must have been one done, as it was the MTV age, at the time that the movie was hatched, would have been nice.

But what we do get is a pretty informative 26 minute retrospective called, A Look Back At Howard The Duck, with Lea Tompson, Jeffery Jones, the guy who wore the duck suit, and the writer/producer, writer/director team, peppered with production video and stills through out.

Next is a 12 minute piece (pretty much a continuance of, A Look Back At Howard The Duck) called, Releasing The Duck, which continues on with production info and the participants feelings on the film's less than stellar reception by the populace in general.

Next up is a nice little assortment of production features done during, or just after, the making of the movie called, Archival Featurettes, that runs for almost 11 minutes, and talks about the music, special effects, etc., of the film.

And lastly we get two pretty nice, Teaser Trailers, for the film (one with Lea Tompson tricked out in her, Cherry Bomb hair and outfit, doing her best, Brooke Shields - Calvin Klein commercial impersonation, talking sensuously about the new man in her life, who just so happens to be a duck, que the feather blowing :)

Okay, so the extras could have been a bit better, but when you consider the fact that the film was considered a total bomb, and Lucas's bastard hell spawn by most, I'm just delighted that the thing even got released at all.

Also of note, is the picture quality, which is quite phenomenal (hey, even DUNE doesn't look this good :) with good colour and a crisp picture, without any sign of film debris (i.e. scratches or dirt).

As for the film itself, I always thought that it was given a bum wrap, and upon watching it again, all these years later, I was quite please to find myself really enjoying the spectacle that is, Howard The Duck.

It's a guilty pleasure that I think more people will enjoy, with this new DVD release, and that's just, ""Ducky"" by me :)",1235865600,5,3050,4.5900735294117645

224394,2,6300185788,"This review is on the movie ""Howard the Duck"". I went into this with an open mind not knowing what to expect other than George Lucas had made it. This movie tanked at the theater and that explains why you typically won't find it on any rental or retail store shelves. Lucas caught a lot of flack on this movie and even he admitted it didn't fare well. Although a copy being made again will make the handful of die hard fans happy, it is doubtful it will sale many copies. This is not to say some movies didn't do well at the theater and then sold very well on DVD. I am happy they are selling it for such a good price to the fans. However, if you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend you rent it first. With movies like Ted out now it will probably appeal to more people.

The humor didn't get many laughs from most during the original release. In fact I mostly heard groans at the theater I saw it at. Great priced quality DVD with several extras and plenty of replayability for Howard fans. By the way I respect the die hard fans of this movie because I know what it is like to love a movie that everyone else thinks is a turkey so please don't give me negative votes because I don't like it. You wouldn't want others to give you negative votes just because you like it would you?

224396,5,6300185788,"Love or hate this film, it has a cult fallowing, Howard The Duck is a first class guilty pleasure and I mean that in a good way.

So anyway here's the story, Howard comes home to relax one day, the next thing he knows is that all of a sudden he's being zapped to our planet, while trying to get back to his home planet, along the way he falls in love with a feisty rock chick named Beverly Switzler and has to stop a monster know as a Dark Overlord before it causes the end of the world.

The film is based on a Marvel comic series created by Steve Gerber, who sadly passed away last away a year ago ( R.I.P. dude ), if you ever read the comics they are worth reading, especially the 2002 Marvel Max series, in which the story was a fallow up to the film.

This film is fun, funny as hell and some very good FX for a film that out in the 80's, the only thing that sucks is that the DVD has no special features but it don't matter.

None the less Howard The Duck is one of my all time favourite film I saw when I was kid and I still like watching today.

Tim Robbins is hilarious in this early comedic role, Lea Thompson is hotter than ever, and this is hands down my favorite Jeffrey Jones performance, outshining ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" and (another underrated and fun b-movie) ""Mom and Dad Save the World.""

224506,5,6300185788,"Howard the Duck is one of my all time favorite movies. Enjoyed it as a kid and I still do to this day. I was incredibly hyped when Universal announced a DVD release back in 2009. Great disc. Had good video and audio. The extras were excellent. So it was a good couple of years before I thought that this movie would look great in Blu-Ray format. 2011 came and went for the film's 25th anniversary. Nothing. Course there are a couple of Blu-Ray releases available for Howard the Duck before this new one. There's a German Blu-Ray that will only play on Region B Blu-Ray players which unfortunately I didn't own one. There's another by Umbrella Entertainment that is an all region disc. This one had a great transfer and has all the extras from the DVD. The audio is a letdown, being only in DTS 2.0. The German Blu-Ray is exactly the same, according to what I've read.

Finally, this year, which also marks the 30th anniversary of the Marvel character's screen debut, Universal finally delivers the duck onto high definition with this stellar Blu-Ray release. The video puts all the others to shame. The still amazing special effects look as good as they'll ever look in years. The audio is a knockout in DTS 5.1. Definitely crank it up for the finale in the Dynatechs lab. The extras are the same batch as on previous releases. Still a good batch of material to weave through on the making of the film.

All in all, Universal's new Blu-Ray is a huge improvement over any other home video release of this movie. Now we just need the soundtrack on CD, if it isn't out yet. If you're a fan of this movie, definitely seek out the Blu-Ray. Marvel had to start somewhere. Howard even got a cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy and is expected to appear in the sequel. That means the filmmakers had some respect for this movie. George Lucas may have disowned this movie and it nearly cost him his filmmaking career, but deep down inside, he still has respect for it. It came out, it bombed, and it fell into obscurity for many years. Then it got reignited into a cult favorite by legions of fans today. Now 30 years later, this movie looks better than ever. A movie that I feel was way ahead of its time. So do yourselves a favor and check out this highly underrated classic, especially in its brand new high definition format.

Oh, Jesus...

What can possibly be said about this movie that hasn't already be said a thousand times? It almost seems redundant and tiresome to keep shooting such an already over-satirized target... though this movie took moments off my life I will never have back. I watched it simply to see what all the fuss was about.

I understand now...

Ughhhhhh....

They actually put this movie on DVD? Wow... well...

Easy target as it may be, I must now express my contempt and hatred. After the severe deforming scar it left on my psyche, it's the very least of my

I actually lost seconds of my life as well, dear children. I actually feel like I'm suffering from motion sickness just THINKING about this movie...

Special FX Master George Lucas disowned this film. I know ""Willow"" wasn't great... and neither was ""Radioland Murders"" Or ""Star Wars: Episode II""...

But here is a movie... that brings us all together... unifying us... in anger, disgust and hate... and annoyance...

Too stupid and lame to be fun and thought-provoking... takes itself too seriously to be campy fun (even by the standards of schlock '50's sci-fi/action movies--now some of THOSE are fun!) But with none of the charm, innocence, sweetness, much grosser, much raunchier... and special FX that even for their time, look cheesy and crummy. They borderline on rolling static.

Too poorly filmed and horribly shot and embarrassingly acted to a fun family movie, too awkward and straight-faced to even be unintentionally funny...

....and the bestiality thing with Thompson and the duck...

well, there's just NO genre for that, now is there?

This was not a good day for film. It's like a full-length version of ""ALF....""

No, wait... I LIKED ""Alf."" I will not smear his legacy by associating it with this interplanetary bird-flu.

The fact that Howard knows a type of martial arts (""Quack Fu,"" as he calls it) is hurtfully unfunny.

And this came from Lucas, who's special FX company ILM is the finest on the planet? The effects are phony and ugly and hideous and horribly unconvincing... and that's the last thing we'd ever expect from George Lucas. The special effects look like they're from the '50's, like the very same surving production values from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Including the acting and screenplay. It's like if Jar Jar Binks got his own starring movie... actually, that might have been better.

It's ""all too easy"" (to quote the great Darth Vader) to point out what a hideously mismade, tacky as can be blunder. One can go on and on about what a monumental waste of film, time, money and other precious human resources. Hell, look at all the time and effort Lucas' other company, Industrial Light & Magic put into this one. Why didn't they just set it all on fire and dump it all into a cesspool? Would've saved time and cut-out the middle-man.

This little piffle was written by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, who are no strangers to Lucasfilm projects, having written several Lucas' projects (""American Graffiti,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Radioland Murders""). They're obviously favorites and friends of Lucas and clearly they wanted to make a special-effects sci-fi extravaganza of their own. And you have to love Lucas for giving them the shot.

But it's a disaster. Willard Hyuck has proved to be necessary and crucial script doctor polishing Lucas' stuff so he seems like a superhuman Greek god of film. But every film he's ever directed is not just bad, it becomes renown for being such a low point in cinema history.

His ""catastrophes"" include ""Best Defense,"" ""Dead People"" and this steaming pile. (OK, I'll concede ""French Postcards."" Hell, I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day).

Kids love taking animal characters, paticularly muppets and the like. Their favorite are the traditional wise-cracking, pratfalling types. Well, I'm sorry to say that Howard lacks humor or charm really of any kind. Honestly, he lacks any kind of interest whatsoever.

Does anyone here remember the scene where Jeffrey Jones as the Dark Overlord in the biker bar... the final showdown where the demons may enter through the portal to our dimension... the scene where Howard brawls with the guy managing the group... all had me shaking my head in disbelief...

I know most of this goddammed review isn't exactly written in a deep, compelling way. But if the filmmakers didn't put any real interest (or much fun) into this one, how can anyone talking about it? Well, maybe at it's expense. That's the best thing you can do with a bad movie.

And for this one, the rolling credits over the musical montage concert at the end... didn't come soon enough.

Former accomplished ballerina-turned actress Lea Thompson has recovered from this abomination thankfully. Though I certainly have not.

It still haunts me...

224536,3,6300185788,"Why does everyone have a major problem with Howard The Duck? After watching it, and reading some of the reviews, I have to seriously disagree with all the negative reviews on here. Sure, it's in no way a classic, and Lea Thompson has really big hair (the hairstylist should have been shot for crimping her hair!!!), but it's fun, it's slightly out there, and there is no other movie that can compare to this. Perhaps Who Framed Roger Rabbit? but only very slightly.

Maybe the reason why this is getting bad reviews, is because reviewers can't get past the idea there is actually a person in that suit. Yes it's not CGI, it's not any fancy technology (even in a film by George Lucas), there is a person in a duck suit. Really!

The plot is pretty simple, but you get the impression it's aimed more towards adults, than a nice little film aimed at the kiddies. Howard gets transported to earth, where he meets singer with the Cherry Bomb,  Beverley, who can't believe she's talking to a duck. She takes him to a friend of hers, a scientist, who can't believe he's talking to a duck ... The story goes on. Then we meet Jeffrey Jones, who is responsible for bringing Howard to earth, and then he turns into a Dark Overlord (here's where I find the resemblence with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?)

The best part of this movie is definitely the songs. I started rocking out to the song at the end ""Howard The Duck"", which I'm now officially in love with, and need to get on my mp3 player (hint hint hint). Why can't I find it anywhere??? I need it and I needed it yesterday.

Lea Thompson is brilliant, right down to her clothing, which is seriously eighties, along with her hair. She's the perfect kooky match to Howard, and even sings!!! I was expecting to see it was dubbed, but she actually sang! The girl can sing.

It's amazing watching Howard interact with everything on Earth, and you've got a heart of stone if you don't feel for him. You do get past the idea that it's a guy in a suit, and if you don't laugh at the quiff he gets when he's in bed, you have no sense of humour.

It's a movie you sit down, turn off the nit-picking critic in your head, press play and simply enjoy.  It deserves to be released on DVD.

There is no comparison between the movie and the comic, so there's not much point in trying to compare the two.  There was no attempt to match the biting satire that Steve Gerber appeared to do with such virtuosity.  The only thing the two have in common is the fact that the main character was a large talking duck who makes friends with a hairless ape (Beverly).

If you want highbrow, then avoid this movie.  If you want superlative acting and dialogue, then avoid this movie.  But if you want something that's fun for pretty much all ages, by all means sit down and enjoy it!

224566,4,6300185788,"In this Lucasfilm flop based on a beloved Marvel Comics character, an anthropomorphic duck from a world of anthropomorphic ducks (imagine a live-action Donald Duck that looks a little TOO real) is accidentally brought to our own Earth by a science experiment gone awry. This duck out of water story plays out as one might expect, assuming you don't avoid films about anthropomorphic animals all-together (sadly, most movie-goers don't seem to have the imagination for the idea; or rather they didn't in '86; Howard probably would have had a much better chance in the '90's, or today with CGI). Howard meets a sweet would-be rocker named Beverly (who seemingly can't get past Howard's plush-toy like exterior, no matter how lude he behaves), and together the two seek scientific help to return him to his home planet. However, things get complicated when the law and the terrifying Dark Overlord become involved.

Full of puns and with a premise many folks simply didn't get, ""Howard the Duck"" is often used as a perfect example of a bad movie. Personally, I think this is a big exaggeration. Perhaps it wasn't as satirical as the comic (I have never read it myself), and yes, it's a goofy concept, but the bottom line is that it is just a fun movie with a great cast and a pretty cool anthropomorphic duck! It's very cheesy, definitely. A lot of the lines and characters are just so dumb, but that's part of the fun. The only part I really don't like is when it goes into the airplane chase, which still feels unnecessary to me and just something that draws the movie out (and often loses my attention). I also think the true form of the Dark Overlord that we see later in the film is too beast-like, considering his intelligence level, but it's no big deal. The movie stars such film fan faves as Tim Robbins and Jeffrey Jones (who play the scientists trying to help Howard get home), Chip Zien and Ed Gale combining to bring the fantastically lifelike Howard to life, and of course, Lea Thompson as Howard's human love interest(?), Beverly. Now, I know Lea Thompson has a good-sized fanbase of guys who were kids at the time and fantasized about her to no end. Well, I was a kid at the time too, and I think I can remember that she was a brief, minor crush of mine as well (among many crushes I've had of all sizes), though I am not sure just what film inspired me. ""Space Camp"" maybe? I can't even remember that movie though. I know ""Back to the Future"" probably killed any slight crush I had on her (seeing her as Marty's aged mom), and I didn't see Howard till MANY years later. Anyway, for the Lea fan, this film may be the top one. I find the 80's hair a bit of a turn off, and much of the clothes too, but she does have an underwear scene that almost makes picky ol' me a Lea Thompson crusher again. One of the best scenes in the film, too.

Anywho, this is a great DVD for the film, lacking only the presence of George Lucas in the modern interviews and any sort of audio commentary. What it does have are some great current interviews in excellent new featurettes, a collection of fascinating archival featurettes, a pretty funny teaser and the film's trailer, all things that every DVD SHOULD have if possible but many do not. Glad to see so many bonus features for a film so widely panned. It really is better than it is given credit for, even if it is very cheesy. This is a film everyone should try at least once!

As for whether or not this film would be better if made today with CGI... possibly, but that doesn't change the fact that physical effects have a charm CGI never will, and only a few films do CGI well enough to pull off starring characters made of the stuff. And, in the end, it's a great script that would/could make a modern Howard the Duck film something well received. This existing version could have used more beefing up in that department. Though, I think the idea of a film about an anthropomorphic duck just didn't have a chance at the time. Nowadays, that part of it would be no big deal for most moviegoers, though there will always be a few with no imagination or who think such a movie should only be directed at kids (the same idea that bogged down ""Monster Squad"", an awesome 80's fantasy flick that, like Howard, didn't worry about aiming at a specific age group).",1185408000,,4309,4.465736040609137

But I am glad that it was made and anybody who wants some laughs and even some poignant moments about loneliness and real alienation deserve to see this movie.  To say more about it is to drag out the plot line and tell the tale.

224583,1,6300185788,"How bad is this movie? Nothing I can say will will drive that point any more than has already been documented. But let's just say Lea Thompson herself learned to laugh at it and her involvement in it. (Anyone who's ever been a fan of Thompson's ""Caroline In The City"" will recall the opening moments of one of her earliest episodes, if not the first, where her and her boyfriend are playfully wrestling around while talking about what movie to go see. Thompson, very tongue in cheek, repeats ""Let's go see that Duck movie,"" as they jokingly poke at it's badness.) ""Howard the Duck"" at the very least gave the world more Lea Thompson, something I never tire of to this day. After all, it was extremely early in he career and who wouldn't pass up a movie role? For that this movie's worth at least 1 star. But throw any other reasons out the window. It can't even escape criticism for simply being a cheeky 80s movie, because even in that it succeeds in the worst of ways. The story line is a reach as you'd have to expect, but the ""duck out of water (sorry, I had to)"" story line just was a constant spitballing of plays on situations Howard finds himself continually throughout the movie that fails miserably. And the interplay between he and Thompson is weak, uninspired, and frankly too lunar to hope for any heartwarming Lea situations that would at least appeal to her fans.

Many are aware that 'Howard the Duck' is one of more notable cult classics that spawned from the oft-hallucinatorily bizarre decade known as the 80's. In particular, those born within, I'd say, '80 and '83; most are at least familiar with the film (dare I call it that?), and many of the goobers I know --  (un?)thankful enough to be spit out of the particular time period -- saw the film countless times throughout their childhood, entirely unconscious of 'Howard''s absolutely disastrous performance in theatres when it was released, and of the overall regard the film retained -- generally, a complete abomination. Naturally, I'm one of the many with such credentials, and revisiting the film is both an interesting filmic experience, and, expectedly, a dreadfully painful one.

I think 'Howard the Duck', if anything, represents a great sort of virtue; the imagination of a young child is admirably forgiving, not to mention having a mind so unclogged by the anxieties of adulthood, that it can take an abysmal piece of celluloid -- in this case 'Howard the Duck' -- and suck out endless amounts of joy from it. Now, I do think without question the one reason 'Howard' is SO prominent a childhood classic, is the simple, surreal idea of a walking, talking, laughably oversized duck thrown onto a planet (universe) of Humans. Even as an adult, the idea is just stupidly amusing, even charming, and I know as a child it was this very premise that set my imagination on fire. And boy, was it oh-so satisfying an experience, every time I viewed it.

So at least, viewing it from a more rationally evolved perspective, I can reflect on this dualistic dynamic between two different beings witnessing the same thing. Yet, I can also rip 'Howard' to utter shreds, unwillingly, and for that not a great deal of satisfaction is gotten. What's really surprising, to me, is that the first five minutes or so of 'Howard' is exceptionally done, and no doubt the filmmakers thought this the most important of the bits within the film. I was awesomely surprised at how impressive and, really, epic the intro was; it used to scare me quite a bit as a kid, when Howard horrifically (his screams helped) gets sucked away into another universe and thrown into space, but I simply admired it from a cinematic standpoint this time. John Barry's score, I might add, within this scene as well as the rest of the film, adds a HUGE amount of feeling -- in fact, I'd dare say it is the ONE consistently wonderful element here, and without it, the film would, in its entirety, be sadistically god-awful.

Then, the rest of the film proceeds. The directing here is 'so' incompetent, mysteriously so, you just sort of stare at it in disbelief. The dialogue and overall absurdity of it all -- the relationship between Lea Thompson's character and, as she so grossly calls him, ""Ducky"", is almost repugnant, not because of the underlining sexual nature they bravely suggest, but because of the dialogue, characters, and acting. Astonishingly bad; Thompson was great in 'Back to the Future', released only a year earlier, but her performance here is one of the campiest I've ever seen. I think this, as well as many other things witnessed in the film, is evidence of a director who doesn't know what he's doing. Jeffrey Jones is the only commendable one here, and Tim Robbin's early but awful schtick of ham is entertaining, but it stops there. The writing is just so stupid; the jokes literally come at an overwhelming pace, mostly through dialogue, at least every twenty seconds on average, and quite honestly I'd say about five percent of them work. The rest just suck, hard. And so, with most of the fundamental elements that make a movie a movie, being so truly horrible, the stench is nearly unbearable.

But still, I'm not to dismiss the entire thing with my current mindset, for there are individual moments that are surprisingly good. The direction  among the action scenes (Jones' monster attacking a mob in a restaurant; the flight scene with Howard and Robbin; the unbelievably awesome special effects of the 'big boss' monster at the end, which are so meticulous and finely crafted, not to mention fluid, scary, and creative, that I can't help but wonder how much of their budget they ate with its creation... it truly, for the time period, is astonishing.) All of these scenes, again underscored with class by the legendary composer John Barry, tickle me still to this day.

Yet, it's just bad as a whole. Bad. Sorry. It will always be one of my ""childhood favorites"", but nothing more. If a DVD is ever released -- and I cannot believe, with virtually every movie ever made now available on DVD, a cult classic such as 'Howard', of such acknowledged popularity, isn't; I honestly think that infamous producer George Lucas' association has played a huge role in this fact, him of course, to the point of ego-maniacal delusion, unaware that his three 'Star Wars' films of the past decade are just as bad). Often, I yearn for the dissociative ability of my younger imagination, as it provided such immersion and believability to a dud like 'Howard the Duck', but such a necessity for one's intellect to grow is not devoid of its own awesomeness. Personally, I'll only recommend 'Howard' to two groups of people: children with a good deal of imagination, or a group of friends getting baked and looking for a good, 'it's so bad it's funny' sort of time (which are great in themselves). That's pretty much it.",1159920000,5,5523,4.8002103049421665

It is a well made B-movie...so if you look at it on that level then it's a lot of fun.  And it's not helpful to compare the film which is aimed at a young audience to the comic which was very adult.

224622,5,6300185788,"Lea Thompson's best science-fiction movie ever! Alas, George Lucas only made two watchable movies - this, and American Graffiti.

Howard, as the Duck who fell to Earth, is a bit too kind and optimistic. Lea Thompson, as lead singer of The Cherry Bombs, is awesome as Beverly Switzler. Jeffery Jones is absolutely spot on as the mad scientist/Evil Overlord Dr. Jenning. Tim Robbins did a poor job as Phil the janitor.

The beginning of the movie, in Duckland, is positively hilarious. Then Howard gets sucked out of his recliner by unknown forces and  taken to Earth. Here he meets and defends Beverly against two goons,excellently played. Chip Zien does mighty work as the voice of Howard.

Unfortunately, Tim Robbins acts like he punched his scenes in, with no vitality. George Lucas, obligated to bring in ILM (Industrial Light and Magic), wasted millions of dollars on an overly long chase scene (which later appears to have been copied shot-for-shot in the movie Speed), money which would have been better spent on an better actor than Tim Robbins, and using the talented writing of Steve Gerber more than the Hollywood hacks GLoria Katz and Willlard Huyck.

Excluding the chase scene (yeah, I know it's in there), this movie is better than the first Back to the Future (which is in my top ten movies ever), so I have to give it five stars. Unfortunately, since the movie cost some $37 million in 1986, there has been no sequel.

224673,2,6300185788,"I have wanted to see this movie for some time after reading countless reviews saying how awful it was. Could a movie from a man who has created and directed so many of my favourite movies (the original Star Wars trilogy, Indiana Jones, and Labyrinth to name a few) be THAT bad? I've always had a sick liking for so-bad-it's-good type movies and after reading about the plot and seeing a few pictures from ""Howard the Duck"" I just HAD to see it. It was hard to find the movie, it's been out of print in the UK since its initial VHS release in 1986 but I tracked down a copy at my local Blockbusters.

I was actually kind of disappointed. The first half of the movie I DID find very enjoyable. Howard, a duck from a planet where ducks exist like humans, except they are ducks, is catapulted to Earth when a science experiment malfunctions. Upon arrival he is practically beaten up by a few punks and chased by bikers. Meanwhile attractive and talented rock singer Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson of ""Back to the Future"" fame) is being sexually harassed by two sleaze balls as she leaves the trashy nightclub where she regularly performs with her band Cherry Bomb. Howard, now hiding in a garbage can after his frightening experiences, hears Beverly's cries for help and runs to her rescue. He saves her, and Beverly returns the favour by offering Howard a place to stay while they figure out how to send him back to his own world.

The movie is fine for about the first forty minutes or so, but then it seems to change direction into total Sci-Fi dom when scientist Dr Jenning (Jeffery Jones, possibly best known for his performance as Ed Rooney in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") has his body possessed by the Dark Overlord, a evil being who was brought to Earth via another experiment gone wrong. From here, the movie is all about the Dark Overlord trying to get power for himself and Howard and a lab assistant called Phil Blumburtt (Tim Robbins, Prt--Porter, Austin Powers 2) trying to find and save Beverly who has been kidnapped by the Dark Overlord and saving the world before more of the Dark Overlord's kind are brought down to destroy Earth.

While I really enjoyed the first half of the movie (it was cute to watch as Howard and Beverly formed a friendship) I felt the second part was really slow paced, despite it being mostly action. I got bored and wished for the end. The actual very ending was nice and helped redeem the movie for me but I wish it had taken a different turn than it did for the second half. Added that the special effects were far from special (I did keep it in mind that this was made before the CGI boom) - Howard's duck costume is really lame and it looks exactly like a midget in a suit.

Still, despite my unhappiness with some aspects there were a lot of things I DID like. The soundtrack was awesome. Filled with lots of yummy 80s rock tunes, many of which are sung by Lea Thompson herself, this movie is a must see for any fan of the 1980s. The clothes, the music, the atmosphere...this movie is about as retro as you can get.

Yes, the movie is bad, to the point where it's the perfect movie for watching with a bunch of friends just to mock it's silliness, but honestly that is part of the charm. The storyline is ludicrous and doesn't make sense, the script is embarrassing, the acting funny (besides Lea Thompson, who does seem to be doing her best and putting 100% into her performence with what she's been given to work with) and the ending a very typcial 80s

First things first, this film is bad, I don't mean bad as in good, I mean bad as in downright appalling. In fact it's one of those films that are so awful that you can't help but enjoy them.

Recently George Lucas has been releasing his old stuff on DVD, so I wonder if he has the guts (or the greed) to release Howard the Dreadful on DVD, I mean, we all know that Lucas is greedy, but one might think that he knows better.

Howard the Flop presents the most moronic main character of all time in a movie, the duck is just a pathetic puppet that makes Tom Green look like a genius compared with this retarded duck. This is the movie that makes your eyes feel tired because they keep rolling at all time. This is the movie that slowed down Lea Thompson's career, she remained fairly popular for a while thanks to the Back To The Future sequels, but after those movies, nothing was the same.

I guess that the same people that claims that Howard the Abysmal is a good movie, is the same kind of people that enjoys Battlefield Earth, Baby Geniuses, Anaconda, Mac and Me and Manos: The Hands Of Fate, how they enjoy this lackluster movie is beyond me. Howard the Lame is the kind of flick that would make Ed Wood feel proud.

After I saw this movie I was ready to throw the tape to the nearest wall and smash it, but instead, I deleted Howard the Joke and taped a few The Simpsons episodes over it.

224683,2,6300185788,"Momma always said, ""you learn more from your failures, than you do from your successes.""  I think Momma has a point.  Sometimes failures can point the way to the future.  The 80's were a good barometer for that, and no other movie has blazed the trail of failure quite like Willard Huyck colossal miscalculation HOWARD THE DUCK. A movie that is inept and pointless, and yet so full of innovative and yes even breathtaking special effects.
HOWARD THE DUCK tells the story of a duck named Howard (voiced by Chip Zein, and played by a bunch of little people in a duck suit) who lives on a planet much like earth, except Duck's are the top of the food chain.  He's a failed rock musician who's finally given up that dream and has settled into the mundane life of an advertising copywriter.  On one particular day, he's just gets home from another day of the daily grind, when he's sucked into a giant laser beam and transported to Cleveland, Ohio on our earth.  Let the comic hijinks begin...well okay let the less than stellar puns begin.
Howard meets Beverly (Lean Thompson) a struggling rock musician and takes up ""roost"" in her apartment.  After a day or so they fall in love.  There's also a young Lab Assistant named Phil (Tim Robbins in a star-making performance) and Dr. Jennings (Jefferey Jones) whom want to help Howard get home, via the giant laser beam that brought him to earth in the first place.
I stop there because the second half of the movie has to do with this wild alien and I'm not quite sure I can do that part of the story any real justice.  Suffice to say there's an alien threat and Howard is here to stop it. Actually he kind of runs away from it as the alien menace and the cops try to stop him.
HOWARD THE DUCK is based on a far more interesting and inventive comic book series created by Steve Gerber.  This movie and that series have absolutely nothing in common but the name.  In fact the movie ruined the comic book series that poor Steve Gerber sued Universal and George Lucas, and then killed off his Duck for a long time.  How's that for fair.
Wait a second you say, go back just a minute, did you just say George Lucas?  Yes ladies and gentlemen.  George Lucas was the executive producer of this film and it shows.  His fingerprint is on everything and more importantly Industrial, Lights, and Magic have designed this film as their audition reel.  They throw everything into the pot, creature effects, stop motion, animation effects, makeup effects, an elaborate chase sequence (that I'm convinced was shot for shot re-created for the freeway chase in the MATRIX RELOADED, well not really but It's nice to speculate.) involving a small personal aircraft, and all of it is breath taking.
But why?  Why did ILM and George Lucas waste all that time and energy?  The only thing I can think is that they were doing tests for Lucas's next big project WILLOW.
You're probably now asking why doesn't the film work?  The biggest problem is there is absoulty no screenplay.  The first 20 minutes of the film fly by, barely allowing the viewer to breathe.  The characters have time to meet, time to fight, time to get back together, all before the story begins to take shape.  By the time it does it shifts radically into a completely different movie involving giant space creatures.
They started out with a promising idea; it's ET in the city.  How does this duck adapt to his surroundings?  That should have been the movie.  But there's no room for special effects that way.  So on comes Act 2, and so many effects shots you shake your head.
I was also a little disgusted by the Human/Duck love scene of course you see nothing, but the implied relationship makes even less sense then the rest of the movie and is really there just to make a silly joke anyway.
This is the key to why this film fails.  It doesn't set its tone properly.  Every other line is some comic zinger that falls flat because the movie doesn't know whether it's a comedy, or an action picture.  There satire, and drama all thrown out there but it goes nowhere.
This effects all the acting as well.  The human characters are robbed of any humanity because the script is so disjointed.  They overreact to everything and poor Tim Robbins is forced to mug for laughs when the audience already knows that there are none.
The script by director Huyck and his writing partner Gloria Katz is so bad you forget that these are the people who hit just the right beats in their more successful film AMERICAN GRAFFITTI.
The films biggest flaw is that it has no audience.  It a tad bit vulgar for little kids, and if you reach the age of 8 you'll be far smarter than this movie is.  As for adults there is nothing of substance in the movie for people to grab onto.
But I guess in the end could HOWARD THE DUCK been a good picture?  Maybe!  There were definitely moments of light in the picture.  Moments that seemed unforced.  I especially loved the early scenes involving Howard and Beverly.  An interesting story could have unfolded.  But the films exciting visuals were more important to the bottom line.  In fact the bulk of the film contains this huge chase scene involving airplanes, cars, 18-Wheelers and lots of destruction. Sure the scene is cool to look at but it's not worth the Journey.
Stay away from Howard the Duck.

Tim Robbins plays the janitor who pretends to be a scientist,
and Jeffrey Jones plays a scientist who goes a little crazy.
The funny thing about movies that are ambitious and
flop, Is nobody copies that formula. Sure Die Hard has been copied over and over. Under Siege etc. But Movies that don't make the big money are often forgotten.

favorite George Lucas film. There is something about Howard the

the movie never changes but as you watch it at a different age

224686,1,6300185788,"Steve Gerber's original Howard the Duck comics were a classic mockery of the '70s, from jabs at religious cults to Howard's run for president in 1976 and even an issue almost entirely in text because of deadlines. However, Gerber left Howard and Marvel Comics at the end of the decade due to his struggle to gain control of his signature character.
Coming in 1986, at a time when Gerber's dispute with Marvel had exploded into a full-blown legal battle (and the comic publisher had practically destroyed Howard with numerous changes in appearance and origin), the Howard the Duck movie was heavly hyped and awarded a huge budget-largely due to the involvement of one George Lucas. What emerged was the worst movie of 1986, and one of the 1980s many candidates for ""worst movie ever"". For those ignorant of the original comic book, the reputation is well-earned, with an unlikeable lead and an incredibly stupid plot. For those of us familiar with Steve Gerber's work, this film is nothing short of an abomination. However, years of repeated (and downright excessive) reruns on cable have created a number of apologists for this drivel.

speaking of roles, everyone mentions jeffrey jones and tim robbins, but no one mentions thomas dolby as the bartender.

Sure, the story line is preposterous. A science experiment gone awry, transports to Earth a lone ""person"" from a semi parallel universe where the predominant species are ducks. Is that harder to believe than a high-school kid who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and starts to grow silk glands, spin webs and climb straight up vertical walls? No, and yet ""Spiderman"" was one of the biggest hits of the year, and was slated for a sequel before it even hit the theaters.
Yes, ""Howard"" is filled with ""predictable, cheap one-liners."" (""Howard, duck!"" ""And proud of it!"") Look at any Mel Brooks or old Bob Hope film. What are they full of? Predictable, cheap one-liners, yet they are some of the funniest movies ever made.

Everything good about the film appeals to the child in everyone (alien from outer space, good guy verses bad guy, goofy sidekick, car chase, etc.). On the other hand, everything that made the movie tank (the interspecies sexual innuendo, the people making out at the ""spa"", ""PlayDuck"", etc.) was the stuff that was supposed to appeal to the adult crowd. Now, had HOWARD's filmmakers focused on just appealing to kids, the movie would have been a lot better and would have probably gotten a bigger box office draw and would be more fondly remembered. Instead, it's thought of as one of the worst films of the 1980s, which is a shame because there was so much that could have been done to make this at least a decent movie. Anyway, the film's worth checking out just for how many times bad movies are compared to it. The strange hybrid it is will make you either hate it or enjoy it.",1036972800,,1633,4.319218241042345
224755,5,6300185788,"Howard the Duck for some reason has gotten a really bad rap from moviegoers everywhere. In my opinion, it was one of the best films to come out of the 1980's. The story is extremely original and has outstanding special effects. George Lucas presents this outstanding off the wall comedy about a fast talking, cigar chomping, beer-loving duck from a parellel universe who somehow winds up in Cleveland. Howard winds up being the object of everyone's desire, in love with rock singer Lea Thompson, and doing battle with the evil Dark Overlord as he attempts to return to his own planet. All of the actors do a great job in this film. Lea Thompson is great as the rocker Beverly. Suprisingly, the relationship between her and Howard is actually touching and she has a pretty good voice. Believe it or not Tim Robbins is in this film, and is actually hillarious. He plays the crazy and off the wall scientist Phil Blumburtt. Jeffrey Jones known mainly for his role as the principal in Ferris Bueler's Day Off, gives the best performance as Doctor Jennings / Dark Overlord. He is hillarious in both roles, and really was able to turn on both at the drop of a hat.
"" Howard the Duck "" is one of my favorite films and one of the best to come out of the 80's. It is down right hillarious, has some decent acting, great special effects, and an original story. When you want laughs, don't look to Daffy or Donald, but to Howard the Duck!!!",1036540800,18,1429,4.5

Why was I recommended this? How is it funny? Set back in the 80's, this dated tale of a cigar smoking, Booze ridden duck who is pulled out of his world (which publishes a magazine called 'Playduck') straight into the bed of Lea Thompson and has the cheek to be too embarrassed. Landing in Cleveland, Howard teams up with Thompson's Rock chick and crew and sets out to fight the evil Dark Overlord. To list this movies good points would be a task in itself, as its inept script, don't care attitude acting and clich plot, it was no surprise that this little light was quickly blown out.

The performance by Jeffery Jones as the guy taken over by the evil overlord just cracks me up.  He is funny, he pulls this off brilliantly.

224760,1,6300185788,"Lea Thompson from the ""Back to the Future"" movies and ""Caroline in the City"" and Jeffrey Jones, the principal from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" meet a talking duck named Howard in this movie called, cleverly enough, ""Howard the Duck.""  It's directed by Willard Huyck, who wrote ""American Graffiti,"" ""More American Grafitti,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  And this.  I'd like to tell you this was the nadir of his career, that he rebounded and recaptured his former glory.  But I can't.  Instead, he found himself writing ""Radioland Murders"" at which point, his career died completely.  No happy ending for Mr. Huyck, the poor guy.

As good as a movie about a talking duck played by a midget in an animatronic puppet suit could be, ""Howard"" has Lea Thompson glammed out as an 80s rocker, lots of special effects, and Tim Robbins as some guy named Blumburtt; as a reward, he got to marry Susan Sarandon right before her looks went south.  The film's concept is also its plot, although at some point, Jeffery Jones becomes monstrously evil and there's a giant laser or some such craziness that Howard has to defeat.

Tim Robbins is an interesting case.  He used to be in movies like ""Fraternity Vacation,"" where he played Larry ""Mother"" Tucker with that Evil Ed guy from ""Fright Night.""  Or he'd be in supporting roles as doofuses (doofi?) in things like ""The Sure Thing.""  Or, he'd be on ""Hardcastle and McCormick"" and costar in a tv movie called ""Quarterback Princess"" in the same week.  It was somewhere in this career phase he found himself starring with a hideous duck puppet in a crappy movie that found about a billion ways to insert the word ""duck"" into everyday phrases.  ""No more Mr. Nice Duck!"" Howard screams at one point.  And Robbins, who has since graduated to films like ""Bull Durham,"" ""Bob Roberts,"" ""Hudsucker Proxy,"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" just wakes up screaming...

Okay, I've tried to tell you as little as possible about the movie itself, because it's as awful as you've heard.  But it probably has some sort of charm for people who enjoy watching atrocities.  Plus, it was made in the 80s, and we all know the 80s are making a comeback.  So maybe it's time for George Lucas to dust off the ol' Howard suit and... NO!",1023926400,2,2254,4.704081632653061

Our dad said we shouldn't watch Austin Powers and then he was mad at my mom.  Then we went and watched Howard the Duck in the VCR for the rest of the day.  3 times.  Dad asked why we would watch it 3 times in a day.  We said because he won't rent us other movies like Austin Powers.  We own Howard the Duck so that is not a problem.  We got him because that was a joke.  We really only wanted to watch Howard the Duck a lot of times because it is our favorite.  We give it 3 stars for 3 times watching in one day.

224775,4,6300185788,"Howard The Duck is a notorious box office dud.  If you ask anyone to name a bad movie from the 1980's, without a shadow of a doubt, most will mention this movie.
I really don't understand why this is so.  I've always liked this movie.  I saw it when it was first released in theaters and I'm proud to say that I currently own it on video.  It's one of my favorite science fiction films... even moreso than some of the latest so-caled sci fi ""greats""!
What's not to like?  The movie is a film adaptation of the 1970's comic book of the same name and it follows the comic's storyline, more or less.  Howard, a duck from a planet populated by ducks instead of humans, crash lands in Cleveland.  He befriends a rock singer (played by Lea Thompson) and her bumbling scientist buddy (played by Tim Robbins in one of his BEST comedic roles!).  Along the way, the trio wind up battling the Dark Overlord of the Universe (who is superbly played by Jeffrey Jones of Beetlejuice).
There are special effects galore in this movie but it's the witty banter that made it for me.  The interplay between Howard and the human characters is often hilarious in a dry kind of way.  Of course, there are also a few over the top comedic scenes in this film (like the scenes with Thompson, Jones, and Howard in the Denny's-like restaurant)... and they, too, are quite hilarious.
Granted, this movie isn't Star Wars... but it doesn't TRY to be Star Wars.  It's The Little Sci Fi Movie That Could... and it never fails to entertain me... even after almost one hundred viewings!  Great stuff indeed!",1010620800,13,1572,4.496478873239437
