8402030,5,B003PMWF2Q,"The introduction of this mathematics method has been a great revelation to me. It fostered the realization that there is a great deal that I don't know. And how little I do know. It gives me great incentive to continue to research the ancient wisdom of thinking, being, and doing. Thank you for making it available to me. I will treasure it always. And I will give myself the gift of investigating the Vedas and their wisdom.",1380931200,,425,4.532467532467533
8402031,1,B003PMWF2Q,"Bought this for daughter in middle school, hoping to give her some math wizardry.  The concepts are quite intriguing (especially the arithmetic shortcuts). However, the packaging, narration, and production quality are poor. It comes in 7 or 8 CD package, which should have been condensed into one or two CDs. The narration is difficult to listen to with bad accent combined with too much repetition where none warranted. My kids refuse to sit through this. Very disappointing.",1380412800,,476,5.181818181818182
8402032,5,B003PMWF2Q,"While there are some good videos out there to show you how to use Vedic Math, this has been by far the best introduction and application of Vedic Mathematics by far.

I've read a couple of books about this but to see it in action and with great instruction and demonstrations, I am very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend it for anybody who is curious to learn this wonderful form of mathematics.",1360195200,3,409,4.453333333333333
8402033,4,B003PMWF2Q,"This set is pretty good.  It covers a lot of topics.  I do have a math background, so I'm not sure how easy this would be for those who are struggling in math.  But I found them helpful, clear, and easy to follow.  I would recommend this course.",1355961600,,245,4.041666666666667
8402034,5,B003PMWF2Q,This is an excellent product. It  was amazing to see how fast one can carry out mathematical calculations once you learn and apply the vedic mathematics methods covered in the DVD set. Gaurav covers all of the topics in the DVD in a very detailed manner and the material is easy to understand. Highly recommended.,1350259200,2,313,4.6909090909090905
8402035,2,B003PMWF2Q,"This is a review strictly on the quality of the physical media and not it's content.

For starters, this item is not new. The plastic wrapping was torn at the top and side, giving me the impression that someone previously opened and returned it. After further inspection, half of the DVD's are either scratched or have smudges on them. Additionally, the audio on one of the DVDs I tested was out of sync with the video. This is probably the result of ""bootlegged"" or bad DVD burning, which is further evidenced by the store bought DVD-Rs that were used to burn the content on to.

In conclusion, I imagine that the lessons on these DVD's were probably good. However, in this condition, it's not worth keeping it for $100. This product seems better priced at $30. I doubt I'd bother returning it if this was the case.

Thanks to Amazon for a prompt refund.",1338940800,,855,4.538961038961039
