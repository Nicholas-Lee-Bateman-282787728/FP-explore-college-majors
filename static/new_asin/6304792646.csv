7877511,4,6304792646,"This is the Tenchi Universe Volume 7 Signature Series (rerelease of popular English dub releases for a cheaper sticker price), so please ignore any references you may have read to Enya on this product page.

In volume 7, we get a wide range of episodes.  In the first offering the girls, still on the run, compete in a swimsuit competition, and a certain bounty hunter shows up to compete herself.  In the second episode, the group finally make it to and through a checkpoint into the Jurai empire, with a little help from someone they hadn't even known was on their side.  Finally, the team makes their way to the resting place of the Jurai Guardian Knights, the real Azaka and Kamidake.

Volume 7 hits right before most of the best climactic moments before the series finale, so this is really your last chance to catch the best comedic moments in the first TV series of the Tenchi franchise.",1157846400,,894,4.59748427672956
7877512,4,6304792646,"I don't know what the editorial review is referring to, but I assure you it's not this DVD! o. O Enya has absolutely nothing to do with this anime series. ABSOLUTELY nothing.

Unfortunately, I can't really review it, since I don't own it and don't know which episodes are contained here, though I have my suspicions. I'm assuming that this is the part of the series where we get into the real meat of it... where we finally meet the real Azaka and Kamidake, and where the threats of ""Yosho"" become imminent.",1138060800,2,507,4.510869565217392
7877513,5,6304792646,"This is another great trio of episodes in the Tenchi Universe series, mixing comedy, action, and touching moments.
The first episode on the tape, ""No Need for Swimsuits!"" is hilarious. It involves all of the girls (except Sasami, of course) entering a swimsuit contest to raise some money. At the same time, Nagi catches up to Ryoko. The contest is great, even though I think it's Ryoko who should win...
The middle one has a bent toward Sasami, including a couple flashbacks to her youth on Jurai. Everyone has to disguise themselves to get by a checkpoint so they can keep on their way to Jurai. Of course Mihoshi screws up and they have to fight their way out. We get to see Tenchi disguised as a girl (hilarious) and some nice action scenes with Tenchi and grandfather Masaki.
The final episode is the best, with the secrets of Azaka, Kamidake, and Katsuhito revealed in an episode that sets up the final battle. We get to meet the knights of Jurai, who are just damn cool (although they are a bit shabby at video games). We also finally get to see the villain's face (or at least part of it) as a buildup to the terrific battle next episode. And there's a very touching moment between Tenchi and Ryoko at the end, a bit more foreshadowing to the end of the series.
All in all, these episodes are mostly comedy, with some action and tenderness thrown into the mix to make it truly great. The Tenchi series are the best shows you'll see on television.",986342400,3,1454,4.490566037735849
