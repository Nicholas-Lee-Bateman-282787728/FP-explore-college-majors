7906794,5,B00000F4SB,I have always enjoyed Sandra Dee. In this film she plays a mother in a try to stretch a bit. The role is different from the ones she did at Universal. A B film but it does entertain you. Fans of Sandra Dee will like this the most.,1363046400,,230,3.8125
7906795,5,B00000F4SB,Being a fan of Sandra Dee I was very happy to be able to find a copy of the last movie that she made on Amazon.... When it arrived I watched it with my nine year old granddaughter... We both enjoyed it... it is a good family movie... and if you are Sandra Dee fan what a bonus to be the owner of her last movie..... Vicky,1314921600,,321,3.8059701492537314

The movie wasn't just ""a sleeper"", it was dead.

I tried a few times and couldn't get through the whole thing, so I guess the ending will remain a mystery. Even for someone with a tremendous need for closure, I am okay just letting it hang there.",1125705600,3,351,4.072463768115942
