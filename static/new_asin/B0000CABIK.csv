1917225,5,B0000CABIK,"We bought this movie for our 3 year-old son for Christmas.  He loves it!  It's not hard to understand why, since the graphics are really good and the music is great!  I hear my husband singing the songs sometimes.  I am a big Rescue Hero advocate as an alternative to the classic GI Joe, since the Rescue Heroes are all about helping people.  This movie is a lot of fun, it teaches good lessons about teamwork and positive behavior.  The storyline is good and the catch phrase ""out of many, one"" is a nice teamwork type of lesson.  My son really likes Billy Blazes and in this movie it shows that even he needs to ask for help sometimes, which is also a good lesson.  We've enjoyed this movie.",1072742400,,693,4.317829457364341
1917226,5,B0000CABIK,"my son is obsessed with the rescue heros and we are slowly building our own mini world of them, so i was very thankful for the dvd, he loves watching it and pretending he is right there in on all the action",1072569600,,206,3.9285714285714284
1917227,5,B0000CABIK,"I initially bought the movie for my uncle's kid for christmas...ANYTHING to get him out of his psychosis with ""bob the builder""!!
It's a surprisingly good movie! I thought it would be cheesy like another reviewer had described, but it's really not all that cheesy (and mind you, cheesy IS pretty relative when it comes to CHILDREN'S entertainment!!)...Granted, there WERE some parts of the movie that were a bit within the bounds of RIDICULOUS...but those parts weren't any more ridiculous than those of some major Hollywood motion pictures such as ""THE CORE"" or ""ARMAGEDDON""...And the episodes from the tv show are SOOOOO cute!!! (I only wish I had stuff this cool to grow up on when I was a child!!)
So, if you have a kid who's into the toys or the show, he'll absolutely FLIP over this movie!! You will not waste a PENNY of your money on this one (you may even end up liking this yourself, heh heh)...As embarassing as it is to admit, I'll have to return to buy ANOTHER copy of this movie, since watching Rescue Heroes has now become my newest guilty pleasure >;.)",1069459200,7,1067,4.621052631578947
1917228,4,B0000CABIK,"This full length movie is a far cry from the TV Show in so many ways -All improvements. Our whole family watched this together when it arrived. Don't get me wrong, the dialog and story line is still cheesy, but better than usual. The graphics are computer generated and very good. Most importantly, there are lessons learned and help is given to others. So full of action, the kids don't notice they could be learning something about behavior while they watch. Fisher Price has been so successful with Rescue Heroes, I hope other companies/producers see that positive role models and action (not violence) WILL SELL. If you have any Rescue Heroes fans in your household they will not be disappointed in The Movie, it's worth the purchase.",1069027200,11,738,4.818897637795276

This movie is actually the second copy which I purchased for grandma's house because now my 2 year old nephew is hooked too! :)
Would highly recommend.",1274054400,,381,4.380281690140845
1917270,5,B0000CABIK,"If you stumble upon this movie at a consignment sale or ""previously rented"" bin for sale, BUY IT.  My four-year old daughter and two-year old son absolutely love it!  There is no violence of any kind in it and it's fantastic silence for parents for 78 minutes!  The kids are freakishly mesmerized, and it's in constant rotation at our house and our #1 pick in our road trip arsenal.  My son sleeps with it...a DVD case!

By the simple grace of God we found ours for $1 at a consigment sale in excellent condition.

It also has cheezy, but catchy song near the end you'll find yourself humming later.",1269216000,,599,4.4495412844036695
1917271,3,B0000CABIK,"It was a decent find however...my wife and I originally did think it was based partially on a true story. However, we were greatly disappointed when we noticed some gross inaccuracies 5 minutes into the movie. First, there was by no way a ""city"" in North Dakota other than Fargo and/or Bismarck that towers over probably ten stories, this movie claimed 20! Secondly, there are no significant fault lines remotely near this great state. To say that this movie is educational in my humble opinion, is a great misnomer. The buyer has been warned.",1262563200,,543,4.787234042553192
1917272,5,B0000CABIK,The original shipment of the DVD Rescue Heroes arrived with no disc in the box.  I was amazed at the promptness of the vendor in correcting this problem and then the follow up to make sure I was satisfied with the product and service.  This is so untypical of the customer service we as consumers receive from most companies.  I would give Amazon and the company that actually shipped the DVD 6 stars if I could.  My grandson loved the DVD and plays it over and over.,1240617600,,467,4.333333333333333
1917273,3,B0000CABIK,"my two rescue heroes (5 & 2) loved this movie; it had a lot of scratches when it arrived, however, it plays fine (I bought it used)",1236556800,,131,3.888888888888889
1917274,5,B0000CABIK,"I am fairly careful of what my children watch on tv.  They basically only watch videos that I pre-approve.  This is one of those videos that I feel good about having my children watch.  With two boys, ages 4 and 5, it becomes increasingly difficult to find movies that they enjoy, which are also acceptible (very little violence, the ""bad guys"" can't be too bad, etc...).  This movie keeps their interest and has a strong theme of teamwork, doing good for others and serving your community.",1207526400,,490,4.662790697674419
1917275,1,B0000CABIK,"I was disappointed with how the characters were changed, especially the women who now spew lines such as ""This is why we accessorize"" and ""I'll be fine just as soon as I fix my hair and make up."" You would never know from this movie that Wendy Waters is second-in-command.

Also, rather than teaching about the value of safety and teamwork (as the TV show does), this is an action flick -- characters take stupid chances and showboat. I recommend that you stick with the DVDs of the original episodes such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rescue-Heroes-Adventure-Collection-Volume-1/dp/B000EES1YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rescue Heroes Adventure Collection Volume 1</a>

This movie is not appropriate for children under the age of 8 due to (1) scary situations that could reasonably result in death or serious injury particularly of characters' parents and siblings, and (2) the depiction of anger and verbal bullying.",1201305600,7,965,5.836879432624113
1917276,3,B0000CABIK,"We are normaly big fans of the Rescue Heros, I think they just packed too many disasters into one dvd. As my son watched the film I couldn't help but notice how tense he was. I asked if he was afraid, he said a little bit. Maybe he is still too young (7) for so much drama.",1198972800,2,273,3.807017543859649
1917285,4,B0000CABIK,"My 4-year-old enjoyed this movie immensely, and we were happy to have an ""action"" movie to show him that didn't promote violence, but rather heroism.  We're big fans of the Rescue Heroes toys are are disappointed that they've been discontinued.

Overall, the movie is entertaining, perhaps a bit long, and the animation is mediocre, but if you're looking for an exciting, non-violent action movie for young children, this fits the bill nicely!",1198281600,,443,5.138888888888889
1917286,4,B0000CABIK,"OK, so maybe it's not the end-all in animation and script writing. But my 3-year-old and 6-year-old loved the movie and have watched it numerous times. I appreciate the great message Rescue Heroes sends to our young ones -- especially boys--that reinforces safety, helping others and integrity. It's hard to find something that's not about fighting and poor behavior. I know Rescue Heroes toys, etc. are no longer in being manufactured, but perhaps Steven Spielberg will make a contemporary feature film and it'll start a whole new trend!!",1188950400,,539,5.136363636363637
1917287,5,B0000CABIK,"This DVD was purchased as a gift for my little boy. He had seen the Rescue Heroes cartoon on TV and loved it, so I thought he might like this full length movie. He loves it and will watch it time and again if we let him! I would recommend this movie, it can be pretty far fetched, but at least it has positive characters and teamwork themes.",1183507200,,341,4.029411764705882

1917290,5,B0000CABIK,My son loved his movie when he was in the stage for Rescue Heroes.  My nephew borrowed the movie and also loved it.  I ended up buying my nephew the movie and he was thrilled!,1169078400,,175,3.9714285714285715

1917293,5,B0000CABIK,This movie is great. He just recently found a love of all things rescue heroes and he is enthralled with this movie. It keeps his attention through the whole thing. It was a great purchase for us and it will gets tons of play here. My 2.5 yrs old daughter even loves it!!!,1150675200,3,272,4.150943396226415
1917294,5,B0000CABIK,My 3 year old twin boys love this movie.  They have some of the VHS that come free with the figures so when they started their Rescue Hero collection this was a must have.  This DVD actually keeps their interest and I can see them learning and then going and playing with their Rescue Heros and knowing how to play with them.  Since watching this movie now I have one who won't let me keep any of my candles lit as he keeps saving us all from the fire.  I only wished I purchased this sooner.,1136419200,2,492,4.09375
1917295,5,B0000CABIK,"You get one full length movie, done in excellent looking computer animation, and two animated shorts from the standard cel animation tv show.  I am usually not in favor of some of these modern, CGI looking movies, but this one doesn't stray very much from the characters normal likenesses and looks good.  The two bonus tv shorts are from the 2nd batch of Rescue Heroes animation, which featured better animation than the 1st.  You will notice a big difference in how some of the characters were drawn, especially Rocky Canyon.  He had a very fat face and looked bulky in the 1st batch, but his face got much more realistic looking in the 2nd batch, and he looks leaner.  They definitely found better animators for the 2nd series, and it shows in the character's faces.

All the videos and DVD's that come free with the toys are usually the 1st batch of shows, which is why this set is nice to have the newer ones, even though there are only 2.  If you are looking for the rest of the shows on DVD, you can get an order form with most of the figures, advertising 4 volumes of Rescue Heroes animated shows.  Volumes 1 & 2 feature the older shows (2001) and Volumes 3 & 4 feature the 2003, updated animation ones.  They are not for sale on Amazon and can only be ordered through Fisher Price (which takes much shorter than their listed 6 weeks time), or through online auction.

If your child is a fan of the toys or the show, they should love this movie, which features tons of action right from the start.  The movie also features some secondary characters such as Rip Rockefeller and Pat Pending.  The main characters of Jake Justice, Billy Blazes, Wendy Waters, Ariel Flyer, Jack Hammer, and Rocky Canyon are all here, with Rocky getting a lot of screen time, as the movie focuses on his eagerness to be a RH team leader.

A must have for any Rescue Heroes fan.  This DVD is VERY hard to find in most local stores, so I would just order right here through Amazon.",1132876800,16,1965,4.4222222222222225
1917296,5,B0000CABIK,"I bought this for my almost three year old son based on hype of the movie and the Fisher Price characters.  He likes the movie and so do I.  It's entertaining, exciting, and positive.  We don't have any character toys yet, but maybe for his b-day or xmas.  I'd recommend it.",1128816000,4,274,4.313725490196078
1917297,5,B0000CABIK,"i bought this movie for my son who is 4 years old.  he loves the rescue heroes.  when we received this movie, my son watched it three times in a row on the same day.  he always wants to watch the movie.  it is a great movie for a child his age.  the movie shows the rescue heroes and how they rescue people who are in danger.  there is no violence at all in this movie.  i would recommend this movie to anyone with a young child.  this movie also teaches how to be safe and what to do when in a dangerous situation.  great movie!!!

1917299,5,B0000CABIK,"Sure, it's to sell toys.  However, this DVD sparks my child's imagination and really keeps him watching.  He runs around acting out super hero situations and is more active watching this movie than anything else.  Now, if I can keep him from wearing a hole in the carpet.",1124755200,3,271,4.604166666666667
1917300,5,B0000CABIK,My son actually picked this out at the video store and I didn't know what it was.  But it is now his favorite movie and he can't stop watching it!  I have to admit I'm enjoying it too.  Good story lines and music to keep you watching.  I even had an 11 year old glued to the TV.  Nice to see some good wholesome action heros without violence.  Thank You!,1114041600,2,354,3.9857142857142858
1917301,3,B0000CABIK,"""Rescue Heroes: The Movie"" is a boon to parents looking for positive entertainment for young children. If there is a better way to capture the attention of a four year old boy for an hour and a quarter, I can't think of what it is. My son repeatedly asked to watch this movie, spurning just about every other kid-oriented DVD out there.

The formal Amazon.com review by Tom Keogh (above) says everything you need to know about the simple plot, so I won't go into detail here. The key differentiator between the movie and episodes of the TV series (by Canadian animators Nelvana) is the movie's reliance on CGI animation. That said, the CGI here is spotty. Some of it looks ""Tron""-era while other bits sparkle. The DVD itself is as basic as it gets, consisting of the movie, two episodes of the TV cartoon series, some still-frame background info on the characters (you'll have to read it to your kids yourself--the print is minuscule and hard to follow for the target age group), and a commercial for Mission Select versions of the Rescue Heroes toys, of course.

Yes, this movie is nothing more than a slick marketing campaign featuring the latest redesign of the figurines. How much that troubles you is your decision. My son enjoys a limited amount of the toys, and the idea of him asking me for the newer Mission Select Team is to be expected having digested the advertising that is the movie. Fisher-Price was truly calculating on this one.

Appropriate movies for the under-6 set are hard to come by, so having one geared to that group is nice. This movie is obviously not in the league of ""Citizen Kane"" and it's a giant ad dressed up as entertainment. Still, the characters display decent values (teamwork, safety, caring for others, courage, and such) and are based on real professions that are heroic in nature, good role models all. The action in the movie is a tad high on the peril factor, so some younger children may find it too intense. On first viewing, my son was a little worked up during the most threatening action scenes, but repeat viewings were not an issue. In fact, he asked for this DVD again and again.

""Rescue Heroes: The Movie"" won't win awards from children's educators, but considering the rest of the junk out there aimed at young children, it's better than most.",1093824000,39,2297,4.650246305418719
1917302,5,B0000CABIK,"I am so glad to have found this Rescue Heroes movie and the Rescue Heroes toys!  My 4 year old son came home from daycare playing (acting out) Power Rangers,  and all he was doing was wanting to kick, punch, shoot, and fight.  I was desperate for an alternative which was action packed and definately still catering to boys.  This is IT!  He and his 5 year old sister now pretend play Rescue Heroes, and I'm much more comfortable with what they're learning.  And the Rescue Heroes are great role models for real life.  I'd recommend to all parents trying to reinforce non-violence, when so much coming at kids is violent.",1084752000,30,621,4.54054054054054

The story line is simple - natural disasters and dangerous weather conditions threaten the world and the rescue heroes rise to the occasion to save the day.  Parents can feel safe letting their children watch this movie without previewing it first.  There is a high level of respect between the characters, something lacking in many children's movies.  Safe and innocent while captivating the attention of little ones.",1389139200,,694,5.169642857142857
