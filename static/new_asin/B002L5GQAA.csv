8372413,3,B002L5GQAA,"A friend sent me the link for the trailer of the movie and since it featured a Scottish Terrier, my favorite breed of dog,I ordered a copy.  The first part of the movie actually wasn't all that bad.  A couple of parts made me laugh out loud.  Unfortunately, the movie became less enjoyable when it got to the cemetary.  Dancing, sex and murders were all badly done and sometimes painful to watch.  No one seemed to be enjoying what they were doing.  However, the very end of the movie was more like the beginning and I enjoyed it.

8372415,4,B002L5GQAA,I definitely enjoyed watching this movie.  Given the fact that it was filmed entirely with one camera and mostly at night the resulting film is amazing.  I plan to enjoy it for many years to come.  It will become a Halloween classic for my household.,1259625600,,250,4.511111111111111
8372416,4,B002L5GQAA,"This is an independent and not a major studio release and was obviously made with tongue in cheek and in the spirit of a
60's zombie and teen drive-in epic. It flirts with humour interspaced with the walking dead but doesn't have the shocking gore of the ""Saw"" series. The cinematography is well done. A must see if you love Scotty dogs!",1259280000,,337,4.451612903225806
