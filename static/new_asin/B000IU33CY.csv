8147377,5,B000IU33CY,"Charlie Rose has spoken about this interview as one of the most important  he has ever done. I think he is mistaken but I understand where he is coming from. The tremedous prestige one might also say reverence Sprinsteen has in the eyes of Americans make the revelations here seem of great weight and significance. Springsteen tells about his childhood, with a problematic father and a saintly mother. He tells of the key moment in his life when his mother used sixty dollars of borrowed money to buy him his first guitar. Springsteen talks about his relation to the E-street band, his love of performing, his practice in writing music. He talks about the influence Dylan and Elvis had on his music. He speaks about the employment or unemployment situation in America and how he tries in his music to speak to the ordinary everyday life needs of Americans. He appears reasonable, somewhat modest. Charlie Rose does a wonderful job as he usually does of getting the interviewee's confidence.
I like a couple of Springsteen's songs but am not a wild enthusiast. For the many many who are this interview is a real gift.",1206576000,,1116,4.752577319587629
