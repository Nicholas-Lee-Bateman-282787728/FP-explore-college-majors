4556451,5,B00542USL0,We love this series.  The series is interesting on several levels and gives insight into the British legal system. We hated to see the series end!,1360713600,,146,4.615384615384615
4556452,1,B00542USL0,"The series of Judge John Deed is quite a well composed and acted TV series, however fans in Australia need to be aware that if you have purchased the first 3 seasons of this show in Australia and then purchase further seasons (4, 5 & 6) from overseas, season 4 purchased from overseas is a duplication of season 3 purchased in Australia. The DVD has different covers but the stories are the same. Very disappointing.",1348704000,2,416,4.56
4556453,5,B00542USL0,This isn't your regular courtroom drama--it's BETTER.  It's so good--the story lines and especially the acting.  I have had to obtain all the sets to keep so I can watch them all over again any time I want!  Great job!,1334188800,,218,4.4
4556454,5,B00542USL0,"This series of Judge John Deed has the most riveting story lines and fabulous acting. It is without a doubt one of the best courtroom dramas exploring important ideas ever. Once you start watching, as we did, with Series One, you will be so engaged by the characters and themes that you will have to tear yourself away from your TV.",1327622400,2,332,4.459016393442623
4556455,5,B00542USL0,Judge Deed is back to his old tricks! This is one of the best British series I've seen so far and season 4 is at the top of my list. Can't wait to see #5.,1324684800,,154,3.4285714285714284
4556456,5,B00542USL0,Deed continues to amaze.  The us should pick up this series.  It is too bad it takes so long to get here.,1318550400,,105,3.727272727272727
4556457,5,B00542USL0,"I see someone was wondering - I bought seasons 4 through 6 right here and got them in two days.

They are in Region 2 format and cost $20.50 each including S/H.  They originated from Denmark and all the liner notes, menus, and subtitles are in Dutch.  Don't care.  This is how badly I wanted these.

You just buy from Amazon a Region Free DVD player.  Or if you are watching on your PC you buy a nice little external DVD player and set it up to play Region 2.

My Region Free DVD Player cost about $70 and would have been worth every penny except I never watch TV on my TV.  It's in the living room which is empty and I have to sit on an uncomfortable folding chair to watch.  And it's too heavy to move.  So after a few weeks of that I bought the additional DVD player for my PC, costing $37.  My PC is a lovely HP Entertainment PC with extra large high quality monitor.  And I am HAPPY!  So is Amazon since I have probably bought so far about $400 worth of DVD's from either Amazon or Amazon UK.

Worth EVERY PENNY.  I love Martin Shaw.  Love his dog also.",1315612800,11,1058,4.038647342995169

4556463,5,B00542USL0,"I would watch John Deed read a phone book. Series is excellent,  even if Liberal in bent,  and daughter is annoying as hell,  and Lawyer gal friend is no fun either.. tho probably appeals to male  viewers.. So what DO I LIKE??  DIALIGUE,  ORIGINALITY ,  PLOT INTRIGUE, NON VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT.",1407369600,3,295,4.78
4556464,5,B00542USL0,"Just love Martin Shaw.  The series is a little self-righteous, in that pretty much everyone but John Deed comes off as not quite honest and ethical.  But there are some really fine actors here and the stories are engrossing.",1400716800,3,224,4.717948717948718

4556467,5,B00542USL0,"We are Martin Shaw fans after seeing this. The characters are almost like folks you know and love.
The acting superb. It is a shame though the BBC is still shelving 2 episodes after all these years, to shield the Pharisaical industry.",1387497600,4,234,4.595238095238095
4556468,5,B00542USL0,I like the series and the characters. It's good to see that he tries to correct some of his faults and it doesn't work right away.,1365724800,,130,4.038461538461538
8456113,1,B00542USL0,"I normally like this series, but Season 4's scripts all portray the female characters as incompetent, dithering fools who can't act without needing to be rescued by men. What happened? Why is this season's portrayal of women so different from previous seasons? Deed's womanizing has become ludicrous to the point of being pathological. The Season 4 scripts are weak and often illogical.",1501804800,,386,5.241935483870968
