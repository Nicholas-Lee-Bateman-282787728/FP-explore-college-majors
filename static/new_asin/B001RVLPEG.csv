8338996,4,B001RVLPEG,"This version is the most accurate on the Expedition and was filmed under the supervision and cooperation of multiple Govt. agencies.  In particular, the production was sponsored by the Army Corps of Engineers (they have a historical connection to the Expedition).  It won a first place Telly award.  Fairly well done but lacks any sense of excitement or drama compared to Ken Burns or Nat'l Geographic versions.  Great for school educational purposes because of accuracy.  For more information contact Executive Productions-Seattle who produced the film.",1351900800,2,554,5.470588235294118
