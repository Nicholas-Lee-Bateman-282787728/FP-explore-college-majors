5020043,5,B006UKX6IC,"I have just got to speak out on this one. They can easily of getten 8 episodes on 1 disc. 4-1 hour episodes/8-30 minute episodes is the norm. I don't understand why 2 discs unless it's so they can charge more. They are charging over $2.00 an episode. I can't help but wonder if it is because of the extra disc that they don't need and probably doesn't cost them any where near that to make. I could understand if one of the discs was a special features disc with lots of extras, but I doubt it. This is just my opinion. I'm sure a lot of people out there don't agree with me. You are just glad to get these episodes no matter the cost, no questions asked. And I'm sure I'll hear from some of you I always do. But I had to speak my peace.",1330041600,8,737,3.9864864864864864

A sister who was a teenager, and parents who were always making documentaries, but i must say i don't know why shout factory extended the second season to over three releases?

5020054,5,B006UKX6IC,"I used to watch this series when it was out on television, and I have been so excited to see this series now being released on DVD so that I can now share it with my oldest daughter. When we watched this she just loved the series itself. Her favorite episode was ""Thornberry Island"" and I have to say that I too enjoyed this one. The series is so much fun and the characters just get under your skin (in a good way). The episodes that we have watched thus far are great and the DVD has truly captured the wonderful artistry of the series. I highly recommend this to one and all, no matter if you are already a fan or a new fan, you will love this set!",1333238400,3,651,4.015384615384615
