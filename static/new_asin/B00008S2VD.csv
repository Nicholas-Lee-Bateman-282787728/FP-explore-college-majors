7986768,1,B00008S2VD,Far too expensive. Together with the tax over $ 100 !!!! The dvd itself is very good and arrived in Holland in good shape.,1388016000,,122,4.125

Rather boring. sorry.",1288828800,,97,4.764705882352941
7986770,5,B00008S2VD,I'm a new mountaineer and try to get as much information as I can. I collect videos and books. Cho Oyu is one of the best videos I've ever seen. I strongly recommend for people who wants to learn what is an expedition on the Himalayas,1261612800,,234,4.108695652173913
7986771,3,B00008S2VD,"Documents the 2000 expedition of 21 climbers attempting Cho Oyu from the Tibet side.

The story line is fairly straightforward following the team driving from Kathmandu to Tibet Base Camp, trekking to ABC, and then the climbing to the camps on the mountain. I liked the filming, giving me a better appreciation for Cho Oyu, especially the challenge of the rock step on summit day. It nicely highlights the ordinary challenges of attempting high altitude climbing, things like trouble acclimatizing, stomach troubles, coughing, and snow blindness.

On October 3, 2000 Tim Boelter, Expedition Leader Dan Mazur, and Durge Tamang reached the true 8201m summit of Cho Oyu. On October 10th the team helped an exhausted Serbian climber, who was suffering from pulmonary edema, down from Camp I. The rescue turned out sadly when he died when his heart went into fibrillation.",1252972800,,867,5.141843971631205
7986772,5,B00008S2VD,"The film is very professionally done with beautiful shots. To me, it's worth the money just for that. But I think what I appreciated most about it is that it doesn't do what a lot of these films do in terms of being melodramatic. It's a very straightforward and very accurate portrayal of Himalayan climbing, from the widespread sickness to the yellow snow and even death. I most definitely recommend it  -- one of the best I've seen.",1057708800,17,434,4.564102564102564

7986774,4,B00008S2VD,"This DVD was a pleasant surprise.  Many mountaineering videos don't adequately capture the trials necessary to climb big mountains like Cho Oyu.  This one gives an accurate account of the challenges and difficulties they faced.  Although the title suggests that this is an ""easy"" mountain, their experiences were much different, with only a small fraction of their team actually making it to the summit.  As a documentary, it showed what a humbling experience it truly was.
The DVD was well very professionally done, which is something I don't always expect in mountaineering films. It was well narrated, and seemed like a show I would expect to see on TV sports documentaries.
I thought the DVD was worth the money, but I may also be biased as I summited Cho Oyu at the same time as this documentary was produced and got to meet the people involved.",1050624000,29,850,4.801369863013699
