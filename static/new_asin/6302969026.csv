532342,5,6302969026,I bought this video in '97 and still enjoy working out with it today. I cross-train and have a wide variety of programs that I do but this one still remains a favorite. It really works you AND it's very easy to follow.  You will have a great time working out to this one.,953596800,13,271,4.018518518518518
7833923,4,6302969026,I first purchased this tape a few years ago. I'm happy to say that I liked it then and like it now.,1381104000,,99,3.5454545454545454
7833924,5,6302969026,"I didn't actually purchase this on Amazon. I bought it way before the internet was what it is now. LOL Back in the mid 90s. I used to do this video all the time. Loved it! Many many years went by and I became unfit but always loved working out, in partthanks to the seeds this video planted. I'm currently a fitness instructor, and I have to say that I will always be fond of this particular video, as it was my first experience doing ""workout"" class type stuff and calling out the cues in my living room. Love it. Would recommend it to anyone.",1374105600,,544,4.190476190476191
7833925,5,6302969026,"This tape is not for the fainthearted, If you're not in top physical shape, then you'll want to workout till you are, even my husband likes this tape and he hates to workout...must be the ladies in white :-)",1373932800,,207,4.333333333333333
7833926,5,6302969026,"I purchased this video back in the mid-90's.  I have to say it's definately worth the money + more.  It's easy to follow, but you would get tired easy.  After doing the routine for awhile, you got used to it.  It's definately a workout and I wish they had it on DVD.  I don't own the VHS anymore because my friend has it, and she loves it too!  I highly recommend.",1223596800,,364,4.056338028169014
7833927,5,6302969026,"I LOVE this video!  It was simple to follow, but challenging just the same.  It was nice to do excercises that you only needed your body to perform, no equipment necessary.  The three girls in the video were totally inspiring because they weren't annoying -- just COOL (and super fit)!  Try it if you want something new when you're shut inside this winter.",1123977600,,356,4.603174603174603
7833928,5,6302969026,"This workout is similar to the 20 Minute Workout, only it is a mix of high and low impact aerobics, and it is longer.  There are  about 5 aerobic sections, then 1 section to work the thighs, 1 for the waist, and a cooldown. Total run time is 40-50 minutes.  The moves are pretty easy to follow for a beginner, and it really makes you sweat.",1110499200,,340,4.121212121212121
7833929,1,6302969026,"This is awful and not for a first timer. You rarely see the instuctor's feet, they do not explain the moves and the camera rotates around three ladies constantly. The background is white,

the ladies are dressed in white, the camera is spinning around them. YUK!",1110499200,2,262,4.695652173913044
7833930,5,6302969026,I lost 60lbs doing this workout starting at three times a week up to 5 times now...and eating smaller portions...I have been doing this workout for 9 months because I am a habitual person....it's great...I still sweat and not bored....I intend to move on to something a bit more intense...but this is great starter I will always come back to this!,1076457600,,347,4.704918032786885
7833931,5,6302969026,I love this video!  Jane reminds me of Bess from the 20 minute workout(sounds very much like her) but this workout is twice as long.  If you liked the 20 minute workout you might like this one too for variety.  Same great music from Shiva with the rotating white stage.  A keeper. It will make you sweat!  Not a voice over like the older Aerobicise videos. Jane leads this class just like in the 20 min workout!,1070236800,8,411,4.285714285714286
7833932,5,6302969026,"This has become my favorite workout video.  It's a little over 40 minutes from warm up through cool down.  The aerobics are challenging but the moves are such that you can easily substitute low impact moves while they are doing high impact moves.  One annoying thing is that sometimes the camera is not on their feet when you need to see the feet.  But, after you've done the workout a couple of times, you catch on to what you need to be doing.  I highly recommend this video for the begineer or intermediate exerciser.",1043020800,11,520,4.48936170212766
