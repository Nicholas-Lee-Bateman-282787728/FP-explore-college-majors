8145082,4,B000ICMF26,"Years ago I had seen this film and I was very enthusiastac about it. Now I longed to see it again so I ordered this film.
Still it has a beautiful ambience, the teachers are wonderful and the young dancers are flexible, beautiful and eager to learn this type of dancing.

Strongly recommended.

Note: there was one short ""hiccup"" in the recording.",1388448000,,347,4.580645161290323
8145083,5,B000ICMF26,"A blast from the 80's: a five-week long class taught by an older couple, once the best in their field, and now expertly teaching ballet students what flamenco is all about.  Susanna is the dancer, who imparts her knowledge with quiet passion, explaining the 'feeling' and the 'philosophy' of flamenco.  Her husband, Antonio, provides piano accompaniment while the students learn the steps and movement of flamenco.  He also explains the musical background of some of the flamenco beats or 'compas'as they are called.  Truly a joy to observe the masters and their young protegees who otherwise would rather never be exposed to dance other than ballet.",1329091200,2,650,5.10377358490566
8145084,5,B000ICMF26,"I'm a flamenco teacher and this is my favorite flamenco film. The teacher reminds me of my first teacher and I just love her. Her explanation of flamenco hands is the best I've ever seen or heard.  I've assigned all my students to watch this film. The teacher's explanations of the flamenco rhythms are clear and concise (and understandable). And most of all, the expression on the teacher's face expresses her love of flamenco.  This film makes me want to be a flamenco dancer when I grow up.",1314489600,3,493,4.590909090909091
8145085,5,B000ICMF26,"I'm quite surprised to see that this has not yet been reviewed. Flamenco at 5:15 is one of the best-made and most enriching flamenco films ever. It's not easy to find or to know about, and definitely a collector's item! Thanks for the experience. Michael",1181088000,,254,4.666666666666667
