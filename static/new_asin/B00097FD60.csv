8058319,5,B00097FD60,I'm a huge WWII buff and this film has a lot of footage I've never seen before anywhere else. If you're serious about your study of the 2nd World War I think this is something that would be very interesting. It has some great footage of the Reichs Chancellery and the aftermath of WWII in Berlin. The film has the original titles explaining where the film was shot. It also has a fantastic classical music score by Wagner. As you're viewing the decimated German cities you're listening to Hitlers favorite composer... Somewhat Ironic I'd say. Overall as a student of WWII I was pleased with this DVD.,1187308800,9,600,4.616822429906542
8058320,1,B00097FD60,"I should've read further before buying this product. For one thing it's a near duplicate of the DVD title called, ""World War II: Germany Destroyed"" The video is old stock Army handheld camera footage without the benefit of any narration whatsoever. It's very boring and a total waste of money. What a rip-off!!",1186444800,2,310,4.867924528301887
8058321,1,B00097FD60,"I should've taken the time to read the reviews on this because I would have been aware of the disreputable product this seems to be. The footage is grainy and what's worse is there's no narration, therefore making it difficult to recognize much of what is being viewed. Also, the running time of the video is a disappointment, it is incompatible with the asking price.
Very poor product. NOT RECOMMENDED!!",1185408000,2,405,4.8
8058322,1,B00097FD60,This is an exact copy of Germany Destroyed - do not buy both as I did -,1181606400,3,71,3.235294117647059
8058323,5,B00097FD60,"Yes, this is a good color film about post war Germany if you want to get a good impression. However I think you must be interested in the downfall of the Third Reich. I was happy to see some new material about Hitlers Reichschancellery and bunker near the Wilhelmplatz.

8058324,1,B00097FD60,"This was a totally silent video. No Narrative and shot by a amatuer photographer doing work in Germany post World War 2. If this had been mention in the description of this DVD, I never would have bought it,",1122508800,40,207,4.333333333333333
8058325,5,B00097FD60,"This film was shot in 1947 by an American industrialist and covers the destruction of the Third Reich in World War II. Many of the Nazi Party's most sacred and important sites appear in this film in total ruins. Included is rare and never before seen footage of Hitler's bunker, the Reich's Chancellery, Hitler's office, Nuremberg rally sites, and much more.  Included is footage of Goebbel's residence after being partially destroyed by Russian gunfire, Luftwaffe Administrative Headquarters (Post War American Military Government H.Q.), the Reichstag and the 1870 Victory Column that Hitler had raised by 30 feet (meters?). Also seen is the Olympic Stadium where the 1936 Games took place, the Krupp Steelworks in Essen, the former Krupp Estate (British Administrative H.Q.), the ruins of Cologne, a trip up the Rhine, the Nuremberg Palace of Justice as well as the Munich beer garden (Burger Brau Keller) where Hitler's career began. This film is a fascinating historical document and time capsule depicting the aftermath of Germany's destruction in World War II.",1115337600,52,1066,5.270588235294118
