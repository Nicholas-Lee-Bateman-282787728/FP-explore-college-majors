8695192,5,B006VIK3VQ,"I can't speak for the quality of the DVD itself since I saw it last night via Netflix but, as a fan of Miriam Makeba since the '60s, I was blown away by the great story.  Very well done and included much rare footage of her, her late daughter Bongi and her two grandchildren. When other teenagers were buying pop albums, I was buying Miriam Makeba's and introducing to all my friends.

I must say that the documentary, as good as it was, suffered more than a little by not having on-screen names as new people appeared. In some cases, one could figure it out fairly easily but in most, it was difficult to know who was who. For example, the incredible Abigail Kubeka and Dorothy Masuka appeared more than once but the only way to know who they were was to look in IMDB's cast listing of the documentary, then compare the names to Google photos, which is not the best way to go about it. Still, I would highly recommend this documentary.

A long-time dream, I finally had the pleasure of seeing Miss Makeba perform and meeting her briefly afterward (she autographed her autobiography for me) a couple years before she died, at Saratoga, California's Mountain Winery and what a great performer. It was bitter cold and she was wearing light clothes but never once commented or complained, and put on a long show.

The bottom line is if you like music - any music - watch this documentary!",1414454400,4,1385,4.50597609561753
8695193,5,B006VIK3VQ,"I was truly blessed to get my hands on this classic. In the United States, little is known about this woman and that is a true crime. The filmmaker did an excellent job in telling the story of this remarkable woman's journey and the interviews and performances really were the icing on the cake. I highly recommend this DVD and if you are a true fan of any genre of music, then you will love this documentary of the woman who brought the infectious rhythms of African music to the world stage!",1351296000,5,493,4.369565217391305
8695194,2,B006VIK3VQ,"Miriam Makeba was a great singer, dancer, and activist for equal rights in South Africa.  This documentary is just what we need so young people (in schools, for example) will know about her.  But this DVD is in non-USA format.  This DVD is for Region 2, and the U.S. is Region 1.  So this DVD won't play on U.S. DVD players.  When will there be a Region 1 (USA format) DVD of this documentary?",1341705600,5,393,4.256756756756757
