2788327,5,B000NY1EC6,"For George Jones, what better tribute one can have, than a good one you can enjoy while you still can.  This tribute is meaningful by those who have been inspired by George Jones, those who call him the best.  The entertainers present are Vince Gill, George Jones, Alan Jackson, Trace Adkins, Kenny Chesney, EmmyLou Harris,  Martina McBride, Kris Kristofferson, Shelby Lynne, Wynonna, Joe Diffie, Trick Pony, Uncle Kracker.

You will hear the souful sad version of ""Grand Tour"" by Aaron Neville, and a bluesy twist to ""She Thinks I Still Care"" with Harry Connick, Jr.  And I love the song ""Bartender's Blues"" beautifully sung by Amy Grant.

Randy Travis sings ""Once You've Had the Best"" and duets with George for their hit, ""A Few Ole Country Boys"".  And Lori Morgan sings the song she also made a hit, the beautiful ""Picture of You"". Connie Smith and George do ""Golden Ring""

""Walk Through This World With Me"", another beautiful favorite is sung by Tanya Tucker and her voice enhances the lyrics.

Sprinkled through the concert are the entertainer's words about George, and he is honored greatly.  They talk about him being down to earth, soulful, genuine, ability to deliver those lyrics, phrases, emotion.  Everybody honors George through their words and the bonus material features extended interviews.

Also in the bonus material are two songs/music videos by George.  Written by Jamie O'Hara (no mention in the printed material) are 50,000 names (a Vietnam wall) and Cold Hard Truth, an excellent cheating song.  O'Hara also did a video on these two songs.

Enjoy this collection!!  What a tribute!!.......Rizzo",1256774400,4,1617,5.0452830188679245
2788328,5,B000NY1EC6,I bought this DVD for my husband who is a Die Hard George Jones fan. It was amazing.,1237680000,,84,3.7222222222222223
2788329,5,B000NY1EC6,"This product belongs in everyone's music library and IPod. It is a piece of musical history in the Country and Western genre.

Two DVD's and one CD in the one package, put together in 2007.
25 classic CW songs in Hi Definition and Surround Sound.
18 artists plus George Jones featured in 5 concert videos.

The CD, with 15 artists, features songs from the DVD.

DVD 1 includes George's first hit (it reached no. 4), Why Baby Why.

The 2 DVDs feature stars including Harry Connick Jnr, Kenny Chesney, Randy Travis, Kris kristofferson, Tanya Tucker, Wynonna, and Alan Jackson - to name a few.

Watching and listening washes away the barren and sad times during George's life when he battled alcohol, drugs and a serious car accident. His comeback is now history.

The Concert package does not include any of George's Gospel offerings but more importantly there is no big wrap for one of his ex-wives,  adorable Tammy Wynette, who does however feature in another recent DVD collection,  George Jones Golden Hits.

George and Tammy made Golden Ring a chart topping hit in 1976 but the video featured on DVD 2 has George singing the duet with Connie Smith.

It is difficult to criticise the omission of any one of George's hits.  He sang a prolific number of songs in a career lasting over 50 years.
This DVD/CD package, featuring the 50th Anniversary Tribute Concert, is a selection of gems.

It reminds us of the words of Frank Sinatra who described George Jones as the Second Greatest Singer in the World. If you do not have this product in your library you are not serious about Country and Western

2788330,5,B000NY1EC6,"I have always said that no one can sing a George Jones like George Jones.  Well, I was wrong.  Up until I bought this Concert Tribute, I thought the only one who even came close was Aaron Neville singing The Grand Tour.  I never liked Randy Travis, but boy can he sing George Jones songs.  Also I loved Vince Gill, Lorrie Morgan, Trace Adkins, Kenny Chesney, Emmylou Harris, Martina McBride and Joe Diffie.  But Uncle Kracker, Sammy Kershaw and Amy Grant blew me away!!!  My only sour note was watching Harry Connick Jr. butcher one of George's greatest songs, She Thinks I Still Care.  I totally refuse to listen to him on this concert.  I hit the skip button the minute he comes on.  Buy this concert if you want to see some great George Jones' songs being performed by outstanding performers.",1200096000,38,795,4.542253521126761

2788333,5,B000NY1EC6,"Of course the greatest living country singer would be George ""Possum"" Jones.  As Emmylou Harris stated in an interview on the DVD, he needs no introduction.  He needs no dancers, or smoke screens or anything else like that.  He is a living legend and is quite simply one of the greatest singers of any genre of music to ever walk the face of the Earth.  In a concert format, several country stars, old and new, pay tribute to Jones by singing some of his most classic, greatest hits.  Most of the instantly recognizable ones are here, such as ""A Picture of Me Without You"", ""The Grand Tour"", ""The Race is On"", and ""She Thinks I Still Care"", and many more.  There are also a few less known ones, such as ""One of These Days"".  George Jones wraps it all up with his biggest hit, and the greatest country song ever recorded, ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"".  I personally would have liked to see a few more well known ones but this is still a superb DVD in honor of Jones, with great sound and picture quality.",1187308800,42,1004,4.360215053763441

2788390,1,B000NY1EC6,"The concert and performances would be well worth owning, except...

Unfortunately, we had the same DVD video/audio synch problem as some others reported.  This was so frequent that the DVD was painful to watch.

The synch problem wasn't as bad played on a computer DVD drive but there were still static ""freezes"" verifying there is some problem with the DVD manufacture.

We returned this for a refund (thanks Amazon for excellent customer service).

This was the 2-disc version and it seems like it may be a relatively infrequent quality problem because it's difficult to believe this problem was encountered by those giving 4 or 5 star reviews.

We liked this concert enough to try again if there is some chance we could get a good quality DVD or perhaps the 1 disc version doesn't have this problem?  Any feedback on the 1 disc version would be welcome as the sync problem comments don't generally indicate which version had the problem.

Thanks.

I can still hear him in the background singing ""White Lightning"" and his most famous song that I loved too ""He stopped Loving her today""  I don't know how anyone has not heard of that song!  All the different country artists sing his multitude of songs and none of them can compete or imitate his unique voice.

But I vaguely recall that Lee Ann Womack was involved in the TV show - and it seems as though she had at least an introduction, if not more than just a little commentary throughout the whole show.  I don't remember if she sang or not, although it does seem to me that she did, but my thinking that she had been on the show was one of the reasons I wanted to get it.
But I don't see any trace of her whatsoever, on either of the two discs, nor any mention of her at all.
I'm wondering if anybody else thinks they remember seeing her on this?
I know that Reba McEntire was the hostess, or introduced each act, and this may be what I remember, but I still thought I remembered Lee Ann Womack being in it.

I see in some of the reviews that some fans that have certain expectations and ideas about how George's music should be presented weren't happy with this one. I understand that but it was a worthwhile purchase for at least one hard core George Jones fan. My dad wasn't gaga over every song on this either, but overall he enjoyed it.

2788465,5,B000NY1EC6,"I missed the original television broadcast of this celebration.  A few days ago i saw the tail end of it by accident and i was glued to the television...George Jones did a couple duets and he was as always very good. Yes I know he passed away a while back.  My two favorite performers were Harry Connick Jr who did an unbelievable job with ""She thinks I Still Care"" and his  killer piano playing was masterful...i had no clue the guy could do C/W.  The other one was Aaron Neville who sang ""The Grand Tour"" ...a very nice delivery...of course Kenny Chesney did ""I always get Lucky with her"" and said some very heartfelt words about Jones ...Reba was the master of ceremony and she was very touching...
at the end George Jones sang ""He Stopped Loving Her Today""...he was right on it.
This is TWO Dvd s and ONE cd and the price including shipping was more than reasonable...honky tonk at its finest

even if you're a casual Country western fan, you will enjoy this DVD/CD combo...strongly recommened.",1378944000,2,998,4.553072625698324

During his life as a musician, he abused his body and ticked off a lot of people but has a voice like no other and wrote song lyrics that kicked butt. We want these old guys to sound like they used to, they don't.  We need to concentrate on the fact that they are still around to give us the last lick they have.  His friends deliver in spades. If you like George Jones, you will want to have this DVD.  He isn't his previous, smooth self and actually seems nervous but with age comes humility.",1361750400,,538,4.144230769230769
