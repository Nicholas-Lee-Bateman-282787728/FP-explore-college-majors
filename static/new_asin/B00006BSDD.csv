7966902,1,B00006BSDD,"What we get here is the camp cult classic, ""The Undertaker and His Pals"", and two pieces of junk that are not worth the time at all.

The ""Undertaker"" gives us a comedic slash and gore romp through low budget filmdom that at times is almost worth the watch; watch it anyway.  The plot: A greasy spoon diner and a mortuary encounter harsh financial times and decide to collude in an endeavor to drum up business.  They go out at night and kill people.  The funeral parlor gets the mortuary business and ships the corpse next door to be served up next day on the blue plate special.  More inane shenanigans ensue, they are not worth the going into here, and fans of bad movies shouldn't miss this one.",1206662400,,699,4.387596899224806
7966903,1,B00006BSDD,"I have a 4 pak called Flesh Feast with these same films.  Let's take each film one by one:

Slave of the Cannibal God-Stacy Keach and original Bond Girl Ursula Andrews.  This film was a pretty good adventure film.  Some great scenery and pretty enjoyable. 3 stars

The Severed Arm-Not bad, pretty funny and pretty corney but that is ok.  2 stars

I eat your skin-Silly fun movie that takes place on a fictional island where voodoo creates the living dead.  2 stars

The Undertaker and His Pals- Now this is a funny movie.  And like someone else stated the Hip Thrusting still has me wondering as well, but that is the silly comedy of this film.  The opening scene where the picture of the sailor changes from happy to shock as he sees his girlfriend murdered was creative and funny.  I give this film 3 stars.  Overall I give the pak 3 stars, would only recommend for people who like silly, creative older films.",1136678400,2,912,4.454545454545454
7966904,3,B00006BSDD,"Although that was a pun, the selection of movies on this DVD is on the tamer side of cannibal movies. If this upsets someone because they get turned on by movies where animals are slaughtered and women are brutalized, they should seek therapy. There are three movies on this single-sided DVD.  1) 'The Undertaker and His Pals': A campy movie that is thankfully not too long. This movie answers the question, ""What happens when you cross Lorenzo Semple, Jr. with H. G. Lewis?"". Nobody asked that question but we still got an answer. 'The Undertaker and His Pals tries hard (too hard) at times to be funny. At times it succeeds and at times it falls flat on it's face. I did find humor and some laugh out loud moments in this movie. Some funny moments were intentional, some not, some I had trouble figuring out which (the hip thrusting recoil scene still has me wondering). I found this movie enjoyable enough to watch for it's short 63 minute runtime. It pretty much falls into the category of so bad it's good. If you do not enjoy that type of movie, you probably will not enjoy this. The simple plot of this movie centers on the owners of a diner and a undertaker who plot to kill women for food for the diner and a burial scam for the undertaker (effectively and annoyingly played by Ray Dannis not Ray Dennis as some DVDs have listed him). This also involves a P.I. and a secretary who becomes food and a secretary they want for food (and no, I am not going to make a remark about that, fill in your own blanks).  2) 'The Severed Arm': Several men are trapped in a cave-in. As time passes starvation sets in. The trapped men draw lots to see who will sacrifice a limb so the others can have food. Unfortunately, now for the one-armed man, rescue comes shortly thereafter leaving a bad memory for one survivor and a lingering revenge against the others. To help confuse matters, this movie features Roy Dennis (not Ray Dennis or Ray Dannis).  3) 'I Eat Your Skin', a.k.a. 'Voodoo Blood Bath': This movie was titled 'I Eat Your Skin' to double-bill with 'I Drink Your Blood' in 1971. This at times was gory for the times but nothing like the title suggests. A doctor (call him mad if you want) conducting experiments on a Caribean island (sound familiar) for a cure for cancer instead ends up creating a bunch of bugged eyed zombies. These zombies are not flesheaters as the title suggests but drag people off, beat them, etc. Thankfully there is nobody with the last name of Dennis or Dannis in this movie.-- Aside from the three feature films, this DVD also contains trivia about real ife cannibals. The quality is at or better than VHS and looks good on a 20"" TV screen. Please do not eat the DVD.-Bob",1100044800,8,2706,4.473684210526316
7966905,4,B00006BSDD,"First of all, I should point out that all 3 of these movies are also available on a collection called ""Flesh Feast"" that also includes ""Slave of the Cannibal God."" Haven't seen ""Flesh Feast"" so I don't know if the picture quality is better or worse.  You do get a menu on this DVD with actual facts about real-life cannibals, for what it's worth.
That said, ""Great Cannibal Classics"" is typical of these cheap multi-movie sets: no-frills versions of the movies, no widescreen, etc.  I guess if you were to buy these movies individually you might get a better version w/more extras, but this is a cheap way to get exposure to these movies without paying lots of $$$.
The best one on here is ""The Undertaker and His Pals.""  Fans of Herschell Gordon Lewis need to see this one; it's got the mixture of blood and horribly acted 1960's comedy-shock-horror that gave his movies their distinctive flavor.  If I didn't know otherwise I would have sworn he directed this one, although it's a little less gory than most of his films.  It's about an evil undertaker that supplies the diner next door (actually named the ""Greasy Spoon!"") with fresh meat.  Really hilarious, especially the ending when they show all the actors.  Must be seen to be believed.
Then there's ""The Severed Arm,"" some 70's B-trash about men trapped in a cave-in.  On the verge of starving to death, they cut off one guy's arm.  Five years later, a guy with a hatchet hunts them down one by one.  Not as much blood as I had hoped for, and parts of the film can be damn slow.  But it has that 70's cheesy charm to it (especially the weird synthesizer soundtrack), and there's a great twisted ending that makes it all worthwhile.  Great for fans of cheap horror films that would have played in the 42nd Street grindhouses.
Finallly, ""I Eat Your Skin.""  Apparently this one ran on a double bill with ""I Drink Your Blood,"" which I've never seen.  It's 60's black and white island zombie nonsense, where the zombies' bug-eyes look like Muppet style ping-pong ball halves.  Don't expect good makeup here.  Worth it for the unintentional laughs, especially the action hero lead who womanizes like James Bond.  Pretty grainy picture quality.
There's not much actual cannibalism in these movies, so don't expect anything on the level of the Italian zombie gut-munchers.  There's not really any gore, with the exception of a couple scenes in The Undertaker and His Pals.  I gave this one four stars mainly for the low price.  Not knowing whether ""Flesh Feast"" is better or worse on the picture quality, I can't honestly recommend it over ""GCC.""  But do keep in mind you get that extra movie for the same or even a lower price.  If you are a real stickler for picture quality, then stay away.  But if high production values matter that much to you, why do you watch B movies in the first place?!?",1072915200,4,2848,4.618290258449304
