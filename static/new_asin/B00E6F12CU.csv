5893477,5,B00E6F12CU,"The next film in the Caeser and Otto saga has arrived. Following Caeser and Otto's Summer Camp Massacre, David Campfield has once again brought a breath of fresh air and originality into the horror/comedy genre.

First off - this film isn't meant to be an attempt at a major blockbuster box office crusher - and that's what I LOVE about it. This is so different than everything is that is being put out nowadays. It's funny, and it's not meant to be taken seriously.

My favorite part about the Caeser and Otto films are the one liners. I mean literally laugh out loud stuff coming out of this movie. Dave and Paul are GREAT together. Deadly Xmas is just about the near perfect definition of ENTERTAINING. I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie where I had a smile on my face the whole time. That's how much I enjoyed it. It was great! I really loved the 24 reference, being that 24 was one of my favorite shows of all time. You can tell Dave has a good time with these movies. It comes across in his performances and I really can appreciate all of the effort he puts in to making these movies. Plus - it has Deron Miller in it, playing a killer Santa Claus. Just that description alone should make you want to watch this movie.  If you're a fan of the b-movie horror genre, then this would be right up your alley. If you take the film for what it is - then there's no way you can't NOT enjoy it!

I hope Dave continues to push these out. I'll keep watching them - that's for sure!",1388102400,2,1492,4.242957746478873
5893478,5,B00E6F12CU,"This is not your typical Christmas slasher. This is a low budget cheese fest filled with low grade laughs and spoofs. The film centers around two dysfunctional brothers Caesar (Dave Campfield) and Otto (Paul Chomicki) and their issues with life, Santa, girls, and Xmas.

The film makes fun of itself. In one scene Joe (Joe Estevez, younger brother of Martin Sheen) plays a troubled actor who has lost a role to his brother.

Hollywood agent Donna Blackstone (scream queen Linnea Quigley) remarks how she was black balled from the industry when she turned 40.

Dr. Helen (Robin Ritter) works with a man who loses his arms and has them miraculously reattached. In real life Robin Ritter was hit by a truck and dragged, almost losing the use of her arm and leg.

The killer Demian (Deron Miller) played Charles Manson in a movie.

The film also uses scream queens Debbie Rochon and Brinke Stevens.

Good film for those who enjoy the camp. I loved how they spoofed themselves.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Nudity (Victoria Vertuga)",1388102400,8,1031,4.823863636363637

5893482,5,B00E6F12CU,"I first saw Caesar & Otto in Summer Camp Massacre. I loved it and couldn't wait for more. I must admit, this was worth the wait! Caesar (played by writer & director Dave Campfield) and his half brother Otto (Paul Chomicki) look for some holiday work and are hired by Xmas Enterprises. There they meet a murderous Santa (Deron Miller of CKY and World Under Blood) who has plans on framing the pair for his handiwork. To say more would be spoiling the fun of this hilarious movie.",1387756800,,478,4.443181818181818
5893483,5,B00E6F12CU,"The funniest duo in recent cinema is back!!! This time, they take on Christmas and it's dark side, Christmas horror films. Personally I love these guys. Their sense of humor is exactly what I want from a comedy film. This installment focuses on the boys trying to find some work and landing a gig with Xmas Enterprises. That's where they meet up with a Santa who has a different way of celebrating the holiday. Throw in a few cameos by some familiar faces and this film is gold!",1387756800,2,478,4.443181818181818

8602053,5,B00E6F12CU,"I love it.  Granted it is low budget, but the gore effects pay off big time.  There aren't a lot of big effects, but what they have are awesome and gory.  There are cameos galore if you are a true fan of the B movie slasher film.  Just look at the cast list.

Be prepared.  This is silly stuff.  If you want to laugh, feel like a kid and let the entertainment wash over you, you will enjoy this movie.  If you are looking for a big studio mainstream experience, then this is not it.

This movie is for the real fans of the slasher subculture.  Most of it is a nod to the genre with plenty of silly winks.  The DVD has a bunch of extras, but streaming just gives you the film itself.

After all of those qualifications, if you see this film having never seen another movie ever, you will still laugh, then groan and roll your eyes and laugh again. I dare you not to.",1400976000,2,865,4.053254437869822

8602055,3,B00E6F12CU,"Main reason I rented this was the appearance of scream queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Debbie Rochon. The latter two are barely in it, only Quigley appeared more than a few minutes and her scene was one of the best. That, a scene with an armless guy escaping a killer santa and at the very end where one of the leads keeps screwing up his lines.",1391385600,,355,4.313432835820896
