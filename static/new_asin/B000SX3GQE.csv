8207062,4,B000SX3GQE,"I have to admit to collecting Disney videos from their animated classic, Disney Parks and select live action films. Most of the Disney Parks videos are more like informercials, but this collection including four individual releases for each park, plus one on their Disney Cruise Line is pretty good as an overview of the park illustrated on the cover. This one for Animal Kingdom runs approx. 30 minutes give or take and has several options to make the experience more enjoyable and gives some replay value.

You can watch the video, or add the Trivia Track which adds fun facts in text at the bottom go the screen. Another option is Disney Details where you can click on the Mickey icon to bring up stills and short video footage of different events and old footage from WDW. There is also so short video footage of first person ride throughs on some of the more popular rides.

The menu is a bit tedious with no play all feature, but it isn't too irritating to navigate. You can probably spend an hour an a half viewing all that is here and it is certainly better than the informercial style DVD's out there. The video quality could be better, but it is improved on over the older version released under the title Happiest Celebration On Earth DVD collection. It's the same exact video with very minimal material added to this newer set. This collection is entertaining for what it is and if you can find them at a reasonable price it's worth it for Disney collectors. One more note this was released in a 5 disc box set under the title When Dreams Come True. This newer set is the better of the two sets, but it really has very little new added to it.",1405728000,,1654,4.473509933774834
8207063,5,B000SX3GQE,"When its months and months until your next trip, this DVD and the companions DVDs for the other parks bring the magic back home. My only gripe is they are around 9 years old now and os much has changed-why haven't Disney made updated versions-its not like them to miss a chance to part us with our money!!
The DVD arrived very quickly-considering we are in the UK-and was in excellent condition.",1360972800,,395,4.5
