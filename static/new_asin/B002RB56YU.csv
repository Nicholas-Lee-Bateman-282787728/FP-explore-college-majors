3972120,5,B002RB56YU,"This was an extremely difficult DVD to find on the internet; that is, until I checked Amazon.com!  With one click shopping, my order was placed and promptly received.  This was a surprise gift for a friend of mine who actually worked on building the Berlin Wall.  He was elated and couldn't believe I had found what he had been looking for for months!!  Thank you for being who you are and doing what you do!",1353888000,2,408,4.4
3972121,5,B002RB56YU,"This is a very interesting documentary, that shows what communist's and socialist's will do to stay in power and force their ideology down people's throat's! If the East German's hadn't built the Berlin Wall, the majority of East German's would have fled to the West and there was a possibilty that this could have led to a World War. You have to ask what sort of government shoots its own people or imprisons them, just because they want to live in freedom??",1344643200,,459,4.609756097560975
3972122,5,B002RB56YU,"I loved this documentary from beginning to end. It caputred all the aspects of why the Wall was build perfectly. I liked how they recreated it through their computer generated technology and how it was remodeled over the past decades it was still up.

Plus how the politics and commumists played a great part in it as well.

It also showed the many bold and daring escapes from those who were heading for the West and how much they couldn't bare to left behind those they cared for so. Plus how very intelligent each of them were at mastering their escapes and of what tools and routes to use.

The story of the two families who went in the Hot Air ballon and the three brothers were my favorites and touched my heart; but so did the others overall.

The story of the Berlin Wall has always been my favorite story in History and I'm so happy that I finally got to see a documentary on it and an excellent one at that.

The American History channel did an excellent job at retelling this historic story from the mid to late 20th century.",1335484800,8,1036,4.347150259067358

8378539,5,B002RB56YU,"Great portrayal of the East German regime and its extreme measures to maintain its population.  I traveled to Berlin via military duty train in the mid 1960s  and can attest to the extreme measures by East German soldiers checking under the train with dogs before we  could enter West Berlin.  I also was able to look into East Berlin from an observation platform at Checkpoint Charlie. Everything turned grey when you entered the DDR:  the weather, the buildings, the uniforms of the soldiers, no colorful advertising signs, and the gray cement wall (before the West Berliners  painted their side).",1486080000,2,599,5.0

8378541,5,B002RB56YU,"Excellent documentary with dramatic historic footage, creative digital graphic and well researched background and explanation of the building of the wall, the crisis it created and the reasons for its ultimate collapse. Personal and family stories of those trapped behind the wall and dramatic stories of escapes add a vivid human dimension to this Cold War epic. That's video should be required viewing in high school history courses to a generation which knows little about the evils of communism.",1473897600,2,499,5.329113924050633

8378544,5,B002RB56YU,"I had no idea of the intrinsic design of the Berlin Wall.  The stories of escapes, some successful, others not, implied the desperate nature of the East Berlin captives.  Informative w/o showing the horrendous acts bestowed upon these Germans. The escape attempts kept this flick moving and I found myself rooting for these Germans.
As in other fact based documentaries depicting Communism, my jaw dropped in seeing the evil in mankind.  That the Commies wanted to own people is beyond my comprehension. As people of a ""Free"" country we must learn these facts, ""Lest we never forget""",1460592000,,583,4.989690721649485
