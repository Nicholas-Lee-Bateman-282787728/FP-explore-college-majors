4164352,3,B003PAXOOQ,"This is my first review of a DVD movie and I would like to thank BookSneeze for sending me this movie for review.
This was a story about Richard Kelly, who was arrested in the 1965 Watts riots. Although he thought he had his life going where he wanted it to go, a night in the prison, changed everything. He is given a probation if he agrees to attend the Seminary his mother wants him to go to for two semesters and study to be a preacher. This is an all-white seminary, and Richard, being a black man, has to break through racial barriers all around him, plus study for something he has no interest in. The caretaker/gardener of the school helps guide and get Richard through many tough choices.
Although I thought the acting in this movie was very well done, I thought the movie itself lacked something. What was the purpose and meaning behind all that happened to this young man? And the Christian Seminary he went to, well, let's just say I use the term ""Christian Seminary"" very loosely. I feel like something was missing in this movie.",1284854400,,1042,4.460732984293194
4164353,5,B003PAXOOQ,"This Dvd was given to me on behalf of booksneeze in return for my honest opinion.

This movie is a true story based on Richard Kelly. In the movie Richard gets into some trouble and as part of his probation he goes to an all white seminary. Kelly is encouraged to ""break racial boundaries by the seminary's President Alan Beckett but when Beckett thinks that money for his project may be taken away he tells Kelly to back off or he will call the Judge. Along the way Kelly meets the seminary's caregiver Samuel Benton ""basement apostle"" Samuel guides Kelly threw out the movie he encourages and helps Kelly along the way. I really enjoyed this movie it teaches a great lesson. This is the first movie that I have seen that shows racism in the church. Great movie",1284854400,,762,4.482014388489208
4164354,2,B003PAXOOQ,"Set in 1965, The Least Among You tells the story of Richard Kelly, who goes to seminary as part of an agreement to stay out of jail. Did I mention that Kelly is the first Black student to attend and all white seminary? While this seems to set up an interesting story, the movie leaves a lot to be desired. If you want to see the movie be prepared to hang in until the last moment to feel any satisfaction, because little comic relief is provided.

I caught myself wanting to pull for Kelly as well as the storyline in general but was continually disappointed. Corruption was prevalent in Kelly, his friends, his classmates, his instructors, as well as the president of the seminary. The only glimmering light was the guidance that was received from a humble janitor, Samuel Benton. Around the last ten minutes of the film, the aggravating plot begins to resolve as Kelly sheds his selfish former life, classmates join his cause for racial equality, and the president is outed due to his manipulative actions.

While the movie may stick to the facts of Richard Kelly's story, I don't believe the transition to film was as entertaining as a film experience should be. And clocking in at over an hour and a half I recommend you spend your time elsewhere.",1284768000,,1251,4.605381165919282

I would recommend buying this movie if you work at a church and need an ""appropriate"" movie to show at a lock-in.  Otherwise I wouldn't bother watching it.  The acting is bad, the technology is bad, and the storyline is decent.  If you love Christian movies check it out, I'm sure that you'll love it if you set your sights low enough.

4164357,4,B003PAXOOQ,"I was surprised that with William Devane, Lauren Holly & Louis Gossett, Jr headlining a movie, this didn't get any screen time in the movie theaters. Although it takes place in 1965, the story of faith, courage and racism still apply today. It would be a true shame if this story doesn't reach a wider audience. With our nation's first black president, this is the perfect movie to remind us where we came from and how much further we have to go.

The story is told in a languid pace, almost like an adaptation of a play. It's an interesting peek into those times. I could tell this was made by a Christian production company. The scenes in Watts aren't as credible as they might have been if the truly colorful language that pervades in that culture was allowed.

The three leads make for an interesting study of contrast against the backdrop of the younger actors. Devane, Holly & Gossett,Jr know their craft and move with an ease that is both subtle and glaring. Their performances is glaring against the young Cedric Sanders, who does a credible job, but who wouldn't look like an amateur acting next to those veterans?

Lauren Holly is developing into a truly adept actor, in the past she was the pretty girl next door, most of her roles were a bit shallow. It's great to see that as she continues on her career, she's choosing some interesting roles and developing into a very nuanced and subtle actor.",1283040000,3,1408,4.579365079365079

The film is beautifully violent, Christian no doubt in its themes but in no way preachy.  The racial context is in fact color blind, speaking to anyone at any time who has ever felt isolated, and in that finds the core of his real being.

I think I liked it better the second time around.  there is a lot to process and many characters.  it is an eyeopener that just because Seminary is attached to a school's name it doesn't mean it's a solid one.  Also being in a Christian environment doesn't mean that racism or for that matter sin isn't still there.  Money can corrupt and hearts can be hardened to God. In an amazing set of events God reaches young Kelly and changes him from the inside out and in  not so easy ways.  In the end the transformation is simply amazing.

Is a true story about an African-American named Richard Kelly who overcame adversity by surrendering his life to Christ. After being wrongfully accused, Richard Kelly is forced to enroll in an all white seminary school during an era segregation/desegregation. Through his journey you see his selfish dreams replaced a God-given destiny.

This movie teaches many biblical principles, forgiveness, walking by faith and trusting God despite circumstances, loving, and surrendering one's self to Christ. I found it very inspirational and encouraging to see a man overcome racism, hate, violence, drugs, etc through Jesus Christ despite his imperfections. Though he was not alone, God placed men and women to encourage and help direct him in the right direction.

I personally found the movie challenging me to continue to surrender my life to Christ and trust in Him no matter the circumstances life throws my way. It grabbed my attention early on and kept my attention throughout the movie...always rooting for Richard to succeed. I would recommend this movie to others to watch. Though due to some violence, racism, and drugs references you may want to watch first before allowing your younger children to see it.",1324944000,,1339,5.28169014084507

Faced with racial prejudice and struggling with his own personal problems, Kelly has to choose between his dreams and God's will.

I watched this movie with skepticism and finished it half-convinced that it was worth my time. The plot was averagely interesting. There were comedic and touching parts at the most unexpected places, and I liked that. But there were also vague scenes and I felt that some conversations were too lengthy and unnecessary. Additionally, some of the scenes were complicated and confusing. This movie might be a good watch for those looking for entertainment, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone wanting a good movie.

4164374,4,B003PAXOOQ,"I watched The Least Among You, starring Cedric Sanders, Lauren Holly, Louis Gossett Jr., and William Devane and directed by Marc Young.

In this movie, a young man makes one simple mistake and is forced to change his life plans and enter a seminary. As hard as he tries, being the only African American man in the seminary is extremely difficult for him. Racism is rampant around the country and this young man must deal with it in a place devoted to the word of God. He must stay, in accordance with his probation, and recruit 30+ African American students to the seminary. Considering the racism around campus, the young man's attempts fail. He befriends the schools janitor and finally receives the fatherly figure he's craved since childhood. The young man continues to work on recruiting more students, but does he succeed?

Growing up in the late '80s, early '90s, I was not exposed to this kind of extreme racism. I find it unbelievable to see how this young man and millions of others were treated just because of the color of their skin. Throughout the movie, the young man expresses the same anger and confusion with God many of us deal with. Not even the one ally he believed has had his back stands by him when money is involved. This movie shows what a role racism had in this country, including the Church. I did not think I would like this movie but I really did. I think we all need to be reminded of the hatred many had for African Americans. Many people today still possess that hatred, not only for African Americans, but for many other groups in our society. Faith eventually intervened for this young man, but he had to fight for it.",1310169600,,1654,4.546979865771812
4164375,4,B003PAXOOQ,"Many of the other reviews talk extensively about the plotline, which is involved and complex and inspired by events in the real-life story of Rev. Charles Marks, who went on to counsel prison inmates and inner city children. I will leave synopsis to those reviews and focus on what I liked and didn't like.

Let me say right away, that I've been a practicing Buddhist for more than twenty years and viewed the DVD via rental from a Family Video Store.  I am familiar with screenwriting techniques and what a high quality film looks like.  I was pleased that there was a lot of spiritual issues raised that more than just Christians can relate to without the film degrading into a preachy message conversion film.  I suspect that writer/director, Mark Young, was respectful of Rev. Marks' actual learning experiences and took his acquired lessons and wisdom into account when writing the script.  In any case, the interview with Rev. Marks in the special features section is a must-see regardless of one's religious background and does broaden out the scope of the film itself.

The story's basic premise involves a young, talented, African American man on the rise caught up in L.A.'s Watts riots by mistake who escapes prison by entering into a plea deal.  The plea deal requires his attending seminary for two semesters and being on probation.  His original intention is not to become a pastor but to serve two semesters and then work for a computer company.

The protagonist faces challenges both at the all-white seminary and from within his own family.  He frequently faces temptation on a variety of levels and must sort out for himself what his purpose is and where higher moral ground lies not just for himself but also for those close to him.

William Devane gives an interesting performance as the seminary's leader who loses sight of what is truly important for the advancement of the seminary and becomes Satan within the life of the main character -- quietly threatening him and bribing him with riches at the same time.  By contrast, Louis Gossett becomes the main character's guiding angel toward discovering his real purpose and letting go of his anger/lesser self in the quest for what is just and right.

Many of the supporting characters have their own secrets and this adds to the richness of the film.  However, I agree with those who have criticized that these secrets are not fully explained but only implied and could have been explained with a few more sentences of dialogue without losing the focus on the main character.  There is subtext and then there is just leaving information out.

The script is strong -- keeping the tension ongoing and where needed.  The dialogue in some places is complex and might be difficult for those to follow if they are constantly ""talking to their friend"" instead of paying close attention.  I watched this alone with subtitles and did not feel lost.  The PG-13 rating is appropriate because of the complexity of the storyline and the issues being discussed.  This is not simple and its intention is not to give way to a 3-minute commerical selling greeting cards.  Bravo to Mark Young for not succumbing to that temptation!

There are a few logic gaps and weaknesses here and there such as the female professor's story (played by Lauren Holly) not being fleshed out and Louis Gossett showing up like a guardian angel to rescue the hero at a critical moment.  Was he shadowing that character all along?  Liked the surprises and turn of events, but I also agree with those that said that the collection of signatures was not really shown or explained as it should have been.

The performance of the lead actor, Cedric Sanders, is outstanding and worthy of consideration for other projects making their way across the desks of Hollywood.  His range is excellent and I look forward to seeing him in other films.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies about race/spiritual issues but encourage viewers to think beyond its seminary setting for deeper meaning about inner struggle and leaving the lesser self behind.",1309824000,,4090,4.847482014388489
4164376,2,B003PAXOOQ,"The Least Among You honestly didn't do a whole lot for me as far as providing an enticing, enjoyable storyline.  I realize how difficult it was for African Americans back when the riots were going on, but this film didn't really touch upon that particular aspect and instead focused on other areas that made it an absolute chore to watch.

Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is how there was most certainly enough potential in the beginning (the first 45 minutes or so) as we witness the black student attend a well-respected college university in Texas.  We quickly find out he's the only African American student there, however, the moment the subject turned away from the struggles the student had to put up with while attending the college and turned towards religion and spiritual beliefs, *this* is when I lost interest.  This is when the storyline became significantly less interesting.

This is because religion became an extremely popular subject from this point until the very end of the movie, and even though the film is based on a true story, I believe it would have worked a whole lot better had it focused on the African American student having to find a way to deal with the white kids who'd constantly pick on him (granted, in reality the situation was probably a lot worse than the movie portrays).  Just keep in mind what kind of movie this is- one with a religious message behind it, or rather, when you believe in something strong enough, your dreams will come true.",1307577600,,1497,4.716475095785441
4164377,3,B003PAXOOQ,"From reading the back cover it sounds like a pretty awesome storyline and I was looking froward to something inspirational. Sadly, I was disappointed. If I want to watch someone break the color line and inspire me I'll watch Remember the Titans long before I watch this again because Remember the Titans will do it with less smoking, drinking, lying, and violence than The Least Among You.

 Sentenced to attend a Seminary for two semesters or go to jail Richard Kelly an A student with the big dreams and a promising future in business decides to take his chances with the school his mother wants him to attend. The lying starts the moment he meets the president a seemingly gracious and intelligent man with big hopes and dreams of crossing racial boundaries. The president of the seminary tells the reason Richard received the full ride scholarship was because of his moving essay. Richard flustered by this information lies, and says that he was really eager to get into the seminary when in fact his mother wrote the essay and he hasn't a clue as to what it says.

And that is only the beginning. For me the movie was entirely too gray. It left too many questions and not enough resolutions leaving conflicts, problems, and questions unsolved.

4164378,4,B003PAXOOQ,"The story is about a young black man, Richard Kelly, who was falsely arrested in 1965 during the Watts riots. His probation is to attend an all-white seminary school.

While attending the school as the only, and first, black man on campus, Kelly faces all the obstacles you can imagine for a man in that situation including prejudice, misunderstanding, and all out racism. As Kelly's confidence grows he begins to fight for change within the school, but eventually realizes the school leaders' motives to let him into the school are not entirely pure. Ultimately his situation inspires as much change in himself as in the students.

The best part of this movie is that it is a true story. I had never heard Richard Kelly's story before and while I think the story is much bigger than can be told in 97 minutes, I was very inspired by the movie. The cast, which gives some good performances, includes Cedric Sanders as Richard Kelly, as well as headliners Louis Gosset Jr., Lauren Holly, and William Devane.

The Least Among You has found an audience in the Christian community, but I daresay the fact that it was directed by Mark Young and produced by Julia Verdin, neither one of them strangers to mainstream media, might be why it turned out so well. Even though I am a Christian, I'd be the last person to claim that the Christian community has turned out several great movies (Yes, there have been some and there will probably be more).  It's nice to see a movie that embodies Christian values that isn't trite, preachy, or overly sentimental. I really believe that Christian values can be seen in all kinds of redemptive movies that are produced in the mainstream, but that's another post.

Bottom Line: This is a great family movie (PG-13) for people who want to take the discussion about the civil rights movement beyond the classroom and into their living room. As a mom, I appreciate the struggle that Richard Kelly went through, not only as a young black man in a white school, but in the choices he had to make about his future. His faith took him through some pretty big trials and when my children are a little bit older, I plan to have them watch The Least Among You.

4164379,3,B003PAXOOQ,"This was an interesting story about a young black man who got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time during the Watts riots in the 1960's.  As a condition of his probation, he is to study at an all white seminary. As the first black student, he has to deal with the bevy of racial issues surrounding the city and the seminary students themselves. He wrestles with some personal demons, and comes to see Christ's love in a personal way. This new found purpose then reveals how he is to deal with the racism of his campus. By emphasizing the dichotomy between leadership and servanthood, he is able to gain support for a petition that will change the recruitment and hiring policies to include diversity. He accepts the trials and diversity, and even risks going to jail again for what he sees as a clear purpose from God.

Overall, I thought the movie was well done. The acting, filming, and plot were a break from standard ""Christian movie"" fare. My only complaint would be the underlying motive that is prevalent in nearly every Christian movie of recent memory. It is never enough to deal with things that a Christian would face in everyday life. The main character must always go through a ""conversion experience"" of sorts.  I think that this type of subplot unfortunately can detract from it ever being shown in the main stream.  These conversion moments have the feeling of an ""alter call,"" and can really turn off the seeker. I think that evangelism is one of the priorities of the believer. But all too often, we shove the message in peoples faces, rather than experiencing life with them and forging a connection to make the message of Christ more impactful.

 It was the year 1965 and racial tensions were still at a boil, it was during this time that a young man by the name of Richard Kelly( Charles Marks) is wrongly arrested during the Watts Riots, given a choice to either spend time in jail or serve out probation at a all white seminary, Richard Kelly takes on the school. Little did he know that despite its facade of being a seminary to become future leaders, Kelly is told to just be a follower or get out. Feeling down and low and trying to live each day as he can among the other students,before they may kick him out of the school and send him to prison.. Richard befriends a recovering alcoholic...Samuel Benton, the schools gardener who also happens to live under the basement. With Samuels guidance and knack for encouragement, Richard Kelly continues to toughen it out in the seminary. And along the way he finds his true calling  among the blockades of a race war.

  We found this movie to be a great watch, it is real and raw and there are a few references to alcohol, drugs and violence... But unlike most ""Hollywood"" theatrics, this movie takes the real life struggles of those hurting and makes the viewer's heart swell with empathy.  After the movie was over our family discussed a bit of how life was back then and sadly still is today, regardless of the colour of ones skin. I would reccomend this movie for everyone, churches, home school families, just based on the sheer fact that ... The Lord  does not have preference over any one colour of skin to make his purpose known.

It's been awhile since I saw the movie, and I've forgotten many of the details, but the one thing that has stuck with me is the fact that the main character's integrity...encouraged by an elderly couple who mentored him...paid off in the end.

Despite some predictable elements, the genuineness of the story (based on the true story of Dr. Charles Marks) makes Richard's experience poignantly real.  The depth of story and complexity of characters make this an enjoyable film.  Solid performances by the cast provide a moving backdrop for a moving lead performance by Sanders.

This is more than another ""race"" movie.  ""The Least Among You"" provides a challenging look at the context in which faith, race, and integrity intertwine.

4164383,3,B003PAXOOQ,"Richard Kelly, an African American man living in the 1960s, is in the wrong place at the wrong time during the Watts riots in 1965. While trying to stop the violence, he is arrested for assaulting a police officer. Richard avoids prison when his lawyer gets him released on probation on the condition that he attend the local seminary, a place made up of all white students. There, Kelly struggles with his civil rights, spiritual calling, and the school's agenda to gain notoriety for allowing a black man to attend their school. In the end, he must choose between his own dreams and God's calling to be His servant.

Based on a true story, ""The Least Among You"" provides a thought-provoking account of the racial tensions that existed in the 60s and the sacrifices made to overcome them. The film is rated PG-13 for thematic content, violence, and some drug use. Although it carries the Dove ""family approved"" seal, it is not appropriate for young children. Big-name cast: Lauren Holly, Lou Gossett Jr., William Devane. Slow moving at times. Good, not great.

4164384,4,B003PAXOOQ,"Richard Kelly seems to have the deck stacked against him. Growing up with a mostly absent father (violent when present), a mother struggling to raise a family alone, and exposed to an environment of alcohol and drug abuse, there's isn't much to hope for in life. Just when he thinks his life has turned around and he is celebrating the procurement of a highly sought after job, he ends up answering the summons of a friend. Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time. That fateful decision shapes the rest of his future in ways he never could have dreamed. He is arrested for assaulting an officer. There goes his dream job and the hope of rising out of the poverty his mother has battled for so many years.

When all seems lost, his lawyer manages to arrange a deal for Richard to be released on probation to attend an all-white seminary (the one his mother had applied to on his behalf). With very little choice in the matter, Richard accepts. But his struggles aren't over. Being the first African American student to attend this seminary doesn't make him very popular. As events unfold, it becomes obvious that Richard is merely a pawn in yet another game--to help make a name for the seminary (and ultimately the president himself) in bringing in more black students and faculty.

The movie, based on true events, provides a rare glimpse into the struggles of the civil rights era. The saving grace for Richard is his friendship with the seminary groundskeeper and his wife. This African-American couple serve as surrogate parents to Richard while he attends school. The husband, Samuel, takes time to challenge Richard's views of his life and even his memories of his father.

While the material is heavy, and not necessarily appropriate for younger viewers, I do feel the movie is worth viewing for high school students with their parents. It provides a realistic view of a tumultuous period in America's history and how one young man rose above his circumstances. One of the most beautiful aspects of the film was the mentoring relationship of Samuel toward Richard. Richard may have started out as the least among the seminary, but in the end proved to be the greatest in courage, principle and faith. And while society might consider Samuel the ""least"" among the faculty, he was actually the greatest teacher and model to Richard (even more so than the seminary professors).

This was a very thought-provoking, albeit painful glimpse of one man's struggle to be a light and a leader for others to follow.

4164385,4,B003PAXOOQ,"""The Least Among You"" is inspired by a true story and depicts the life of Richard Kelly, a young black man who wants to make a difference in 1960s Philadelphia but has to change course when he's arrested in the Watts riots and accused of assaulting a police officer. A plea deal allows him to serve 2 semesters probation at the local theological seminary/college. The seminary president is thrilled, welcoming their first black student and pinning high expectations on Richard. Others are more skeptical. Richard finds a mentor in the college's handyman/gardener, Samuel, who helps him during his trials.

I really enjoyed watching ""The Least Among You"" and plan on watching it again with my husband so he can see it too. Occasionally it was a little hard to follow some of the jumps between scenes but overall a superb movie with excellent casting. Lauren Holly is great as a jaded former missionary now teaching at the seminary and Louis Gossett, Jr. beams on screen as the friendly, helpful gardener who takes Richard under his wing.

I don't want to spoil the ending but let me just say that after an hour and a half wondering what was going to happen...it was very satisfying. I plan on watching the bonus feature on the DVD ""Rev. Dr. Charles Marks - The Real Richard Kelly"" which tells the story of the man that inspired the movie. Overall, I would recommend this movie but would caution against showing it to younger children. The movie earns its PG-13 rating with violence, language, drugs and smoking, along with what the rating box calls ""thematic elements"" that I admit are somewhat necessary to storyline. Overall, a great movie that I greatly enjoyed and highly recommend.

As Richard meets challenge after challenge, layers of deception and disloyalty are uncovered.  In the end, this is a story of redemption and of doing the right thing, even in the face of adversity.

I found the story compelling; the rest of my family had reactions from ""Good, not great"" to ""Do I have to watch this?""  My only caveat would be this:  because of the theme and some violence, I wouldn't recommend this for younger children.  I encouraged my 13-year-old to watch it, but I don't think I'd show it to younger children.

4164388,4,B003PAXOOQ,"This movie stars Louis Gossett, Jr., Lauren Holly, William Devane and Cedric Sanders. It is set in 1965 during the turbulent times of race riots and extreme bigotry. The Least Among You follows Richard Kelly (Cedric Sanders) as he enters a seminary school as the first black student. It is inspired by a true story.

Although Richard Kelly is attending the seminary as part of a probation agreement to avoid prison (for a crime he did not commit), he quickly finds that he must choose between his dreams and what is becoming more apparently his destiny. The seminary is looking for ""black followers, not leaders"" but Richard Kelly, the students and the faculty eventually realize that ""leaders are not chosen, they're called.""

In my opinion, this movie is a great opportunity to learn more about the difficulties black citizens encountered every day in the 1960s and prior. It was very heavily based on religion, which is not something I am typically interested in watching in a movie. However, I was intrigued by the movie, especially the character Samuel Benton, played by Louis Gossett, Jr.

I think this movie would be a great introduction to high school students when discussing American History. It is a time that many of us would like to forget but is one we should use to influence how we behave with present day issues. I would suggest high school teachers to show this movie and discuss the comparison of the struggle black Americans faced and that of what gay Americans face today.

This is not a feel good, snuggle up with your honey kind of movie and probably not one I will watch again, however, it is one I think we should all see. One whose topic we should continue to discuss.",1293235200,,1694,4.712837837837838
4164389,3,B003PAXOOQ,"Edmond Burke wrote, ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" The Least Among You is a capitivating film based on the vocational beginnings, a true story, of Richard Kelly, an African American who reluctantly entered into ministry, not to mention, relatively speaking, on account of being forced into an all-white seminary. With God's guidance and godly counsel from some of the most unsuspected corridors of life, he would eventually perservere and become an advocate for the least of these who most recently was a faculty member of San Francisco Theological Seminary. In typical fashion, Louis Gossett, Jr. does a wonderful job, but with a career as storied and a talent so rich we have come to expect nothing less. This is a must see film, especially for those at a vocational crossroads or who are otherwise seeking to catch a glimpse of God through the fog of trial and tribulation. Indeed, God is present in the seemingly mundane, as well as the seemingly grand books and crannies of our existence.

If you are a person who only likes to watch movies that sweep you along from one intense moment to the next, making you sit on the edge of your seat, then this movie is not for you.  If you are a person who only likes movies that end with the boy getting the girl, this movie is not for you either.  This is not a sci-fi thriller, not a futuristic fantasy, not a western nor a documentary.  This is a movie that examines what it is that makes us humans.  It is a look back at a history of our nation that some would like to forget and others still live.  It is a soul-searching drama that makes you ""feel"", and makes you want the main character to excel.  It is ""inspired"" by a true story.

But what exactly does that mean, ""inspired"" by a true story.  Movies inspired by or based on true stories often contain only the barest hint of the truth behind the story.  Often, Hollywood takes true stories and use artistic license to shape and form the story into something that will sell without worrying too much about the truth until they have wandered so far from the real story that it is almost unrecognizable as the reality it is based on.  I wondered about this movie given this fact.  How ""true"" was this story?

Fortunately, the DVD has special features that answer that question fairly well.  The main character in real life has a different name then in the movie.  But much of the story...the ""core"" of this drama, is indeed true-to-life.  In view of this fact, I found this movie to be well worth the viewing and would recommend it to my family and friends with the disclaimer that it is a real-life drama.",1292457600,,1634,4.308196721311475

Race is a key theme throughout, but when an unexpected friend comes alongside to help him with his goals, Richard sees the way to success and works hard for his goals.

4164392,3,B003PAXOOQ,"The Least Among You is a film based on a true story of a young Black man, Richard who attends a previously all-white seminary as probation for an arrest during a riot. The film follows Richard as he is placed in school with people of competing agendas, including, his mom, the dean, and even himself. Will one agenda overcome the others, or will they come together for the good of all?

Overall, this film has a strong message. The story was compelling but unfortunately, the budget, the script, and/or the production made the film hard to follow at points. The film itself, being produced by a Christian company has to make some obvious adjustments to content which is fine, but the somewhere in the production the story became jumpy. There were points between scenes I was confused how we transitioned between the two. I am not sure if this was a problem with the script, the production, he budget, or a combination. Because of this I have to give the film a lower rating. If you can overcome the jumpy transitions you may find a compelling message that is worth the trouble. 2.5/5 stars.

4164393,2,B003PAXOOQ,"The film The Least Among You is inspired by a true story, a dramatic presentation of an age-old theme, racism.  As part of an unusual probationary requirement, Richard Kelly is sent to an all-white seminary.  If he completes two semesters his charge is dropped and he is a free man.  Kelly is the only person of color in the seminary and is met with obvious disdain by his fellow students.  However, over time he befriends them, overcoming some of their personal racist barriers.  An underlying story is the pull of Kelly's old life, particularly of his friends and family.  This story is interesting but frankly just couldn't hold my attention throughout.  The pace is slow, the cinematic use of back flashes confusing, and the characters too shallow.  That's probably the part which I struggled with the most; I didn't really care what happened to the characters, even Kelly himself.

Although, he is encouraged to break the racial boundaries, he is repeatedly rejected and goes about doing so in all the wrong ways. Eventually, he meets Samuel, who becomes his mentor and friend, and who challenges him to make a decision between what he wants and what he is destined to do.
Christian movies are known to be low-budgeted, poorly made, and very cheesy, so that made me a little worried when I selected to review this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was very well made and had some great actors in it like Lauren Holly, William Devane, and Louis Gossett Jr. The lead actor did bring a bit of cheesy to the film and there were some ""dream"" scenes that left me a little confused.

4164395,5,B003PAXOOQ,"Recently, I got to review the movie The Least Among You.  Knowing the reputation that Christian based movies have (as either being really corney, lame and just badly produced and acted), I was kind of not looking forward to watching it.  I honestly chose it as it looked like an easy review to do....

Well, to say I was surprised is a huge understatement. This movie far exceeded my rather low expectations.  The acting in it was great.  The director did a wonderful job and there were only a few issues I noticed with bad scene splicing and camera angles/panning.  I prefer more in the way of a soundtrack, but that is a personal issue, which you can blame on my husband, however, from the time period this movie took place in, I understand that mainstream music choices were not in the best interest of the film considering what one had to choose from.

This movie was set in 1965 right after the Watts riots.  Richard Kelly either gets to go to prison and delay his dream job working in the tech industry or serve a one year probation as a seminary student. With a 3.5 GPA....oh, and did I mention that he would be the only person on campus (except for the gardener/handyman) who wasn't white?  Tough situation to find oneself in for sure. Can Richard disprove the opinion of his fellow students and professors about himself and other people of different races? Can he survive being hazed, his mom's illness and still follow his dream?

This movie is about so many things besides the horrors of racism. It is about overcoming challenges no matter what they are.  It is about rising from a dismal past into a better future.  It is about fulfilling what you are called to do instead of seeking to serve yourself.  This movie has so many potential discussion starters in it, especially for the younger people of today who maybe haven't lived through things such as Richard and his classmates have.  I look forward to using it in our homeschool journey, when the children are much older (probably around 13 or so depending on their maturity level) to spark discussion and research projects.

The Least Among These is rated PG-13 and is about 97 minutes long.  It was produced by Lionsgate (who has other movies available). The movie stars Cedric Sanders, Lauren Holly, William Devane and Louis Gossett, Jr.

Kelly is torn between his civil rights duties, spiritual calling and the presidents agenda for his presence at the all-white school.

A successful student, Richard Kelly is in the wrong place at the wrong time during the Watts Riots, and as part of his ""probation,"" he is sent to an all-white seminary. The president, Alan Beckett (William Devane) sees this as an opportunity to use Kelly as proof that they are integrating the school, but Beckett is not looking for black leaders. He is instead looking for ""Uncle Tom"" students who are willing to follow instead of think for themselves.

Kelly is not an ""Uncle Tom."" At times the acting is overwrought and an ugly stereotype of the ""angry black man,"" but at other times, the movie is so slow that it's hard to stay committed to the story.

Richard Kelly is serving time in jail having been accused of committing a horrible crime. Although he states his innocence, he has two choices. One of which is attending an all-white seminary. Richard has dreams that doesn't involve preaching, but he finds this choice better than jail.
Very few accept Richard, and as he copes with his new probabtion sentence, he learns that friends he had before seem against him as well. During this time, his mom becomes terribly ill and needs extreme medical care. The doctors first need five thousand dollars to treat her. Can he get through this? Richard faces recurring dreams that he can't seem to understand. He meets ""the gardener in the basement,"" and begins to realize what his purpose in life truly is, and he is a true friend.
While Richard is trying to achieve his goal, he is rejected by many that cannot see past race. He begins to see how much strength he really has mentally. Richard is threatened by the seminary president that if he follows through with his goals, he will be put back into jail.
Find out how this young man handled these situations and trials. This is a very good movie that teaches us that God has control and has His own plans in our lives. In God's eyes everyone is equal and we should see everyone the same as well.

Published by Lionsgate

Inspired by a true story, The Least Among You is the story of one young mans calling, and journey to surrender. Richard Kelly (Cedric Sanders), a talented student and natural leader is arrested in the 1965 Watts riots; throwing his career and dreams for the future into turmoil. In a plea bargain, Kelly agrees to enter an all-white seminary program for two semesters on probation.

Alan Beckett (William Devane) the schools president personally awarded Kelly's scholarship hoping to reinvigorate the facilities demographics and bring the seminary into the forefront of cutting edge campuses. Beckett challenges Kelly to step up as a leader and break down the schools racial boundaries, promising to have his back whenever needed. Yet as the semester progresses, students and faculty, including former African missionary Kate Allison (Lauren Holly) spurn Kelly. Downtrodden and frustrated, Kelly meets campus gardener Samuel Benton (Louis Gossett, Jr.) who guides, inspires and supports Kelly through trial and tribulation.

Motivating and inspirational, The Least Among You takes a grim look at seminary life for those non-white Christians led by a calling in the mid 1960's. Faced with racial tension and discrimination, Kelly rises above the human nature we all have within us to fight our way out. A very real reminder that in order to follow the path that God has planned for our lives, we must first surrender completely to Him.

Through the acting talents of Cedric Sanders (Richard Kelly), William Devane (Alan Beckett), Louis Gossett, Jr. (Samuel Benton), and Lauren Holly (Kate Allison), the story comes alive.

How is a young, black man to live after being arrested in the 1965 Watts Riots?  His dream job was just out of reach and his mom opened the door to a seminary education.  This movie, inspired from a true story, shows us how to get past ourselves and seek peace and friendships with those who are different from us.  The story pulls you into the hardships of life in 1965.  From the difficult beginnings to the ending, this movie shows how God is always with us even when we don't feel Him or desire Him.

I am not a big on violence, fires, or robberies in movies, and obviously in this movie there is a good amount of that.

The overall movie set-up reminded me of Facing the Giants or Come What May - both phenomenal movies but with short, often in-cohesive transitions, and so-so acting. The movie was very homestyle, with short scenes and off/on acting.

I did love the premise of the movie and how Richard Kelly is willing to fight for what he believes in. It is really neat to see the spiritual journey he embarks on, and the spiritual guidance ""the gardener in the basement"" gives him.

I thought it was a wholesome family movie, especially if you like movies that follow the same type of theme. The acting is not unbearably bad, and the spiritual, inspiring message, taken from a true story makes it worth an hour and a half of your time.",1287532800,,1027,4.505376344086022

Well, needless to say, I was wrong. This movie centers around a character, Richard Kelly, who got in trouble with the law and must serve probation at this all-white theological seminary. He is less than thrilled, but he's mom is all for it so he sticks with it. And the movie follows his journey through the seminary, and all the trials and victories that came with it. I was expecting it to be another movie that showed how racist white people were and just really focus in on that. But what I loved about the movie is how not only did it show that whites were indeed racist against blacks, but that it could go both ways. I love the scene between Kelly and his Texan roommate; it really hit home about how it doesn't matter if you're black, white, red, or whatever...we are all made in the image of God. So, whenever anyone looks at a person as any less than that, they are wrong. I enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend to watch it at least once because it is an inspiring story.

Richard Kelly was arrested for assaulting a police officer during the Watts Riots of 1965.  As a part of his probationary agreement, Kelly was to go to an all white seminary.  The president of the seminary wanted to use Kelly as his MLKJ to integrate the seminary.  Kelly goes along with him, but proves to be too provocative to suit the seminary and its president.

While in seminary Kelly meets the only other black people on campus; the janitor and his wife, who live in the basement.  With their help Kelly finds that he is just as rage filled and prejudiced as the white people that he rails against.

In the end, Kelly sets the seminary on its head, the leadership on its head, and helps one professor reclaim the faith that she once professed.  In the process of it all Kelly learns to trust God.

4164410,2,B003PAXOOQ,"When I finished writing my last book review for Booksneeze, I immediately looked for the next book available. To my surprise, I found that Booksneeze was offering a movie for review! How fun.

A historical film, dealing with social issues, and based on a true story? Sounds like my kind of movie!

I asked my husband to watch the movie with me so that I could hear his opinion to help me construct my review. Unfortunately, neither of us cared for the movie. While I believe it had a good social theme (treating people with kindness regardless of their skin color) and a good spiritual theme (forgiveness and making the right decisions even in the face of difficulty), we thought the movie was poorly done.

Main issues - mediocre acting, underdeveloped characters, poor lighting, choppy scenes. Mr. Kelly decides that to orchestrate change, he is going to draft an amendment for the school by-laws with the required number of student and faculty signatures. What is the amendment about? Good question. It's not very clear what Mr. Kelly was petitioning for, only that it was something about increasing the enrollment of black students and faculty.

Toward the end of the movie, Mr. Kelly undergoes a very confusing conversion scene. Immediately after, his fellow students change from hating him enough to burn a cross in Mr. Kelly's room to wanting to support Mr. Kelly's petition. Why? Why the sudden change?

My biggest complaint about this movie is that The Dove Foundation printed their seal of approval on the cover of this DVD, certifying it as ""Family Approved."" I would not show this movie to any child under the age of 16, if even then. The movie is rated PG-13 for ""some violence, thematic elements, and brief drug material."" They forgot about the main character taking the Lord's name in vain, frequent smoking and alcohol use among school faculty, a scene showing a parent physically beating their child, and a girl's dress being ripped off.

Hopefully the true events this movie was ""inspired by"" were more inspirational.

4164411,3,B003PAXOOQ,"I was given a review copy of the movie entitled The Least of These.  The title of this movie comes from Luke 9:48, in which Jesus states that the ""least among you will be your servant.""  The story behind this movie comes from a true story of a man, Richard Kelly, who was the first African American man to attend a seminary.  Although he originally went against his will to serve out a probation period after being arrested in the 1965 Watts riots, Kelly soon realizes the importance of breaking racial boundaries.  After befriending the school gardener, he is helped through various verbal and physical trials that are, sadly, a result of his skin color.

While this movie taught some great lessons on leadership and overcoming obstacles, it was hard to follow in many places.  The plot moved very slowly, and I was left with some questions without answers when it ended.  The movie was still inspiring, and helped viewers understand what life was like back in this time period of history.  I would recommend the movie to others.

This movie is based on the early life of Charles Marks, a man about whom not much else is readily available.  From what we see in the movie, there are marks of biblical Christianity at work - a rebellious, deceptive, self-interested person arrested by the Spirit of the living God, contrary to the human's desires.  We also see a man in a position of power who attempts to work things to his advantage, while positioning himself to look good among men; getting exposed.  Such will it be on Judgment Day when the Lord judges the works of all people and exposes self-righteous acts that fool everyone but God.

In a pleasant departure from so many ""Christian films"", Least Among You has good actors and good acting; a good script with only a few lax places; good locations/stages; and an overall sense of being a quality film.

Good things include solid friendship that does not disappoint, family ties that do not quit, sin that is exposed, repentance, and faith in God.  All in all, very much worth an hour and a half.

It's about a young African-American man who comes straight out of a tough neighborhood and becomes the first African-American to attend an all-white seminary. From what I gathered in the description, I figured that this would be the same movie that I've seen several times before. Thankfully, it wasn't.

The thing that I really enjoyed about this movie, is that his struggles weren't all about race. He had to overcome the darkness in his past and inside himself, to move forward and do something great. Just like all of us, his past manages to cling on as hard as it can. We all struggle with that.

This movie has Christian themes, which is good, but it isn't really an overtly Christian movie. I wish that the gospel was presented clearly in this movie, but it's not. It's basically a movie about redemption and overcoming your inner demons, so in that respect, it's been done before.

That being said, it is an entertaining movie that I think you'll probably enjoy, whether you're Christian or not.

4164416,1,B003PAXOOQ,"Who doesn't like a movie where good triumphs over evil?  I love a movie where the hero stands strong in his convictions despite great opposition.  That's why I selected ""The Least Among You"" from Book Sneeze.  Based on the movie's description...I thought the movie would be inspirational.

After the movie ended my husband Chris turned to me and said, ""I'm glad that I don't have to review that movie.""  I wasn't eager to write my review on ""The Least Among You"" because overall the movie was disappointing.

The movie is based on a true story of Richard Kelly (Cedric Sanders) who was arrested following the Watt's riots in 1965.  Richard was accused of assaulting a police officer and decided to serve probation instead of fighting the charges.  His probation was to be served out at an all-white seminary near Los Angeles.  As the only black student, Richard encounters prejudice from both students and professors.  The seminary's president Alan Beckett (William Devane) encourages Richard to break through the racial barriers until his actions threaten the schools financial backing for a media center.  Samuel Benton (Louis Gosset, Jr.), a gardener at the seminary, befriends Richard and encourages him through many trials.

Some of the performances in the movie were good, in particular Cedric Sanders and Louis Gosset.  The most interesting characters were the gardener Samuel Benton (Louis Gossett, Jr.) and his wife Bessie Benton (Starletta DuPois).  They demonstrated the most Christ-like characteristics and seemed to have a living faith that had transformed their lives.

However, I find fault and take issue with the movie's screenplay.  Most of the Christians in this movie were portrayed as corrupt, or bigoted, or lying thieves, or greedy and lacking in faith.  They seem like a caricatures, rather than real people.

The seminary's president was greedy and corrupt and many of the professors were ignorant and prejudice.  A former missionary Kate Allison (Lauren Holly) seemed like a caricature of liberated women in the 60's and throughout the movie she was smoking and drinking.  Worse yet most of the characters at this seminary, professors and students alike, seemed to be devoid of anything resembling true faith in Jesus Christ.  Why any of them were at the seminary is a mystery.

The movie was provided to me free through Book Sneeze as part of their selection for Christian bloggers.  After watching this movie, I'm not sure what would qualify it as a ""Christian"" based movie.  Not only was the movie disappointing, but it was also offensive to me as a Christian.

In my opinion the alternate theme of the movie can best be described as the ""dangers of going to a liberal theological seminary"".  In the movie, the miracles in the Bible are called into question and attributed to being nothing more than allegories, and truth is said to be relative.  Rather than sharing the Gospel message that salvation and forgiveness of sin is found in Jesus Christ, the movie's message is centered around a social gospel which promotes change.

The movie never fully explains what happened to the former missionary to cause her crisis of faith.  Also it left me wondering what happened to the seminary president's wife who appeared to have suffered some type of mental breakdown.  I wanted to know what led to the president's downfall and corruption.  Was he ever a ""man of faith"" or was he just running a business?

Because this movie is ""based on a true story"" it's hard to know what's true and where writer/director Mark Young took literary license.  Based on the screenplay I wanted to ask Mark Young if he personally knows any Christians?

I would not recommend this movie.  Spend your time and money elsewhere on something that is in keeping with your Christian faith and values and gives a faithful presentation of the Gospel.",1286496000,4,3846,4.984301412872841
4164417,3,B003PAXOOQ,"The 1960s were known as a time of civil unrest.  Riots over civil rights and race were all too common place.  The Least Among You which is loosely based on a true story takes place during this time period.  Richard Kelly, played by Cedric Sanders, was caught up in the 1965 Watts riots.  He was given a choice to go to jail or go on probation and attend an all-white seminary.

Kelly quickly realizes that all may not be what it seems at first.  Teachers that should be helping him are instead harassing him.  Samuel Benton, the gardener played by Louis Gossett, Jr., ends up being an unlikely mentor and friend to Kelly.  Samuel helps him through the trials and tribulations that seem to plague every facet of his life.

I was prepared to really like this movie as it sounded like something that we would enjoy.  Instead, both my husband and I found it just okay.  It wasn't one of those movies were we felt like we had wasted our time watching it, but it also wasn't one that we would want to watch again.

The acting was fine, but the characters needed to be fleshed out a bit more.  The plot felt under developed, and the story seemed to skip around too much.  While it wasn't our favorite movie, I do believe that this type of movie can be useful to those interested in things that happened during the fight for civil rights in the 1960s.

The Least Among You is rated PG-13 for thematic content (drinking, smoking, groping of a woman...), violence, and some drug use, so it's not really a family movie even though it is Dove family approved.

This movie was an encouragement, inspiring, and frustrating at times.  The things that Richard had to go through were incredible and sad but the way that he kept pressing on and even when all odds were against him he didn't lose the will to press on.

While it may have been inspired by a true story, it could have told that story in a way that was clearer and more understandable.  The plot is hard to follow because the movie jumps from scene to scene in a disjointed fashion.  Subplots are alluded to but never fully developed.  For instance, the viewer never really discovers what tragedy occurred to embitter missionary Kate Allison and so her rejection of Kelly is problematic.  The characters are not very believable and it is hard to feel sympathy for Kelly's plight.

There are some thematic elements that make it unsuitable for family viewing: a man groping a woman, smoking, drinking, and violence.  One wonders what the overall theme was meant to be; Kelly goes on to become a pastor, but viewers are never shown a conversion experience, and his motives for choosing to enter the ministry are not clear.  Originally, he enters seminary to avoid jail; the inference is that life events at seminary influenced his change of mind.  How sad that worldly events, and not spiritual events, were the influencing factors. This is not a movie for anyone who likes a solid plot, interesting characters, and a compelling story.

The Least Among You is inspired by a true story of redemption, and destiny. It stars new comer, Cedric Sanders, who plays the real-life Reverend Dr. Charles Marks. He has been placed in a precarious position of either choosing jail or his freedom and chooses the latter.  Although he is innocent, he is not the ""innocent""; rather he is straddling the fence between good and bad, and following his destiny.
The movie features well-known actors that could play any role well, namely - Louis Gossett, Jr.,  William Devane and Lauren Holly. However, the movie lacks the functionality of connecting the dots. It would be a good read, but does play out well on the big screen.

4164428,4,B003PAXOOQ,"I was privileged to see a preview copy of a great movie directed by Mark Young titled ""The Least Among You: Leaders are not chosen, they are called"" staring Cedric Sanders, Lauren Holly, William Devane and Louis Gossett Jr. Inspired by a true story, this movie was a pleasant surprise and I found it to be superb in its acting and story content. It has a Christian theme but in no way unpractical.

The story springs out of the 1965 Watts riots in California where it realistically presents the period's racial prejudice and social strife. Here is where Richard Kelly (Sanders) is arrested in Los Angeles during the riot and is sentenced to either go to jail or serve probation and attend a seminary by the name of Wesbury Theological College. Kelly is surprised to find he's the only black student in an all-white school and is encouraged to break the racial barriers by seminary president Alan Beckett (Devane) but soon learns the school wants black followers not leaders. Even former Missionary to Africa Kate Allison (Holly) rejects him.

What began as a temporary situation unfolds as a journey of self discovery. Kelly faces racial obstacles to his acceptance at the seminary, he at his point of despair when he is ready to quit receives guidance from Samual Benton (Gossett jr.), the seminary's gardener and the only other black person on campus. Kelly realizes that he is battling racism, but also is wrestling with God to find his essence and purpose for being at seminary. Is it punishment or the providence of God?

Benton quotes to him the words of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ""Pain is like a holy angel who reveals treasures to men which otherwise remain forever hidden."" The film in whole deals with the issue of racism within Christian walls then and now and climaxes with an altercation with the president seminary. On an additional note I found it as a great bonus was the interview with the real Richard Kelly (Reverend Dr. Charles Marks) in the special features. It is my hope that this message reach a wider audience that in Christ there should be no racial lines. This would be a great movie to spur discussion in a church group or bible study setting.

4164429,3,B003PAXOOQ,"Springing out of the 1965 Watts riots in California, this movie realistically presents the period's racial prejudice and strife.

When Richard Kelly joins a seminary to escape jail time, he is surprised to find he's the only black student in an all-white school. What begins as a temporary situation and a solution to a problem, Richard's stay at the seminary unfolds as a journey of his discovery of himself and the potential for good in the most unexpected people and places.

The Least Among You is ideal, not just for a family night over popcorn, but as a discussion tool for church groups. The versatility of this movie will certainly ensure a long shelf life in your home or church.",1285718400,,688,4.725
4164430,4,B003PAXOOQ,"Inspired by a true story, this movie is top-notch. The acting is superb. I was pleasantly surprised because Christian films are not know for great acting. However, one of the greatest actors, Louis Gossett, Jr. really does a great job and I believe he inspired the rest of the cast.

Leaders are not chosen, they are called.

What a great sentiment. It is true. There are a lot of man-called preachers out there, as well as man-called leaders. The truly great leaders are those called by God to do a God-thing.

I'm not too keen on movies that are inspired by true stories because you never know what's true and what's Hollywood. However, this story works and is compelling. The message is that we should rest in our faith, follow God's leadership in what is right, and let the chips fall where they may. Probably one of the hardest things to do in this secular world is to ask God where He's working and go there. It's a message that was strong back in 1963 and even stronger today because we Christians are big on the fuzzy-feel-good and soft on the hard issues that cause a ruckus in the world, or rips in the fabric of society. That is difficult, but we're not permanent residents of this world, we are merely temporary campers so causing a ruckus shouldn't be heart wrenching.
This is definitely 4 of 5 stars.",1285718400,,1314,4.512605042016807
4164431,4,B003PAXOOQ,"This movie is aimed at many audiences. I say this because there was a clear battle between religiosity vs. faith, racists vs. those who see no distinction in color and those who get involved and those who watch others be involved. There are many angles to this story but it is no doubt God-centered and Holy Spirit driven.

Clearly the takeway was the importance of surrendering to God - to not just knowing His Word, but living it, hiding it in one's heart to use when one must go on the offensive against evil. This movie was also a reminder to true believers in Christ to constantly look for others (the underdogs) to help along the way.

Richard Kelly (Cedric Sanders) got a scholarship to Wesbury Theological College in or around 1965 (this is based on a true story) by writing an essay - and by being a ""Negro."" Without spoiling the story I will leave out some details which are later presented which form the true foundation of the reason Richard avoids prison.

Oh the blessed brother in Christ that comes alongside Richard! Samuel J. Bennett(Louis Gossett Jr.) befriends Richard and welcomes him into his home whereby his wife also shares godly wisdom and points out the Holy Spirit's leading in Richard's life. This relationship is a trinity of true believers who band together against the evil forces hell-bent on tripping Richard up with the intention of sending him to prison.

Female teacher ""Kate"" is living in the past. She was a former missionary to Africa. She is hopeless yet she is a teacher of the Bible. Richard seeks her out for help with racism. Right after his room is set on fire, actually a cross that his Mother gave him is lit in his room. Kate has no solutions biblical or other. She is self-absorbed with her loss from the past.

Throughout this movie the battle of good vs. evil is hammered and hung high making it impossible to miss. The struggle to survive is demonstrated in Richard's battle to get money to help his sick mother. Throughout this movie Samuel is a father figure/big brother hero. The relationship is not only heartwarming but inspiring. Seeing the love of God and the understanding of Spirit-led faith lived out by Samuel is something we all need to witness more often. I was inspired by his willingness to lose alot by being a helper to Richard.

The fact that Richard was the first and only person (and the only person of color) to quote Scripture was not lost on me. A scene with Kate teaching the class stuck with me. The students were parsing Scripture with no context whatsoever and Richard set them all straight with his declaration of Isaiah 55:11 and Proverbs 3:5-6. He did not state the actual references however he quoted verbatim (I looked them up).

The title is the theme of this movie. I found four references to the theme, ""The Least Among You.' [...] Matthew 2:6, Matthew 11:11, Luke 7:28, Luke 9:48. Richard also quoted Heb 4:14-16.

Lastly, the President of the college exited the movie with his admitting he basically wanted to be God by stating, ""I am the Gardener. I do the pruning."" He hung up his pruning shears in that scene. He won't be needing his gardening gloves in Hades.

Not about to be a spoiler, I just want to close with this. In summation, Richard Kelly knew the Word, hid it in his heart. He may have been many things, but he was not a hypocrite like the rest of the class. I cheered for this hero and his friend. I cheered because the world needs the Word not religiosity. I grieved because sadly the rest of the class represents much of 'Christianity' today. However, God will always provide the hero in each generation. They just have to show up for class. He will do the rest. Rent it today!

4164432,2,B003PAXOOQ,"We have often heard the phrase: ""Leaders are not chosen, they are called.""  The Least Among You, a new movie by first time director Mark Young, is inspired by the true story of Richard Kelly.  Kelly was arrested in the 1965 Los Angeles Watts riots and is sentenced to serve probation at an all-white seminary. Kelly is encouraged to break racial boundaries by the seminary president Alan Beckett.  Unfortunately, what Kelly discovers is that the school wants black followers not leaders. Even former missionary, Kate Allison initially rejects him. With a prison sentence looming, Kelly meets the gardener, and his life is forever changed.

It is a great story - unfortunately it is a lousy movie.  The acting is poor, the editing is questionable at times and the whole thing just bogs down.  Why is it that ""Christian movies"" always seemed to be a step behind the other offerings that Hollywood has?  It certainly isn't because of the story, because this one is powerful.

After watching the movie, I am inclined to go read the book, but I am not sure if one exists. I loved the story, but I cannot recommend this movie.

4164433,2,B003PAXOOQ,"I recently received a copy of the movie ""The Least Among You"" from my friends at BookSneeze to review. I am so appreciative of the opportunity to review books and movies that it makes it tough when you have to write a bad one. With all apologies to BookSneeze and the makers of the film, I didn't really care for this movie. The story...yes. The movie....no.

This, for me, goes to the age old debate of if we should call ""Christian Films"" good just because it had a good message and the acting was terrible (see also: ""FireProof"" and ""Facing The Giants""). I'm actually not sure this was a ""Christian Film"" because it was clearly and I mean CLEARLY edited. There were several parts where the words that were mouthed and what was said were obviously two different things. I'm fine with that, but added to the lack of quality acting, it only made my review less favorable.

""The Least Among You"" is inspired by the true story of Richard Kelly who was arrested in the 1965 Watts riots and had to attend an all-white seminary in order to serve his probation. The story is intriguing. What unfolds are the tough decisions that Richard Kelly must face and the mentoring of other people in his life. Though there were strong actors (Louis Gossett, Jr., Lauren Holly, William Devane), the acting was not strong. I would have almost rather have read a book about this story then watch it play out on film. While I feel bad doing so, I can't really recommend ""The Least Among You"" as a must see film.

Overall I give ""The Least Among You"" a 2 out of 5.",1285632000,,1542,4.4416961130742045
4164434,4,B003PAXOOQ,"As a Christian who has witnessed (in 2010 no less) the racism that exists in many Christian institutions (I am not black - but attended a bible Institute in Pensacola Florida that still employs segregation by their exclusion of blacks from classes. It is not a 'written policy' - but the President of the Bible Institute actually stated this fact in classes), this video was of special interest to me.

The central figure, Richard Kelly, was arrested in the Watts riots in 1965 and was required to serve probation in an all-white seminary. What is interesting is that many of the 'activists' want Kelly to 'break the color barrier'. But what they want is his service, not his leadership.

In the day we live in where most 'civil rights leaders' make merchandise of their own people, this story is especially relevant.

It is surprising that a film with a well known actor such as Louis Gosset, Jr received such little publicity, but perhaps the subject matter influenced this.

There were so many characters in this movie with their own struggles not just with racism but with trusting God. I was able to understand the character development and follow the storyline with ease. I wanted to see more about these people and learn who happens to them next. The story is more than just about Richard Kelly. It's about you and about me and doing what is right even when it is hard.

At first, I as taken aback by the PG-13 rating. How can a family movie be rated PG-13? Well, this movie has tough issue that will be hard for a middle schooler to fully understand. Human frailty is not new, but it is hard to understand. Now I understand the rating and am glad that it is not rated a feel-good-family-movie. It is a terrific story that I highly recommend.

There was lots of attitude shooting around, lots of unfair angles and biases.

I would not recommend this movie. My husband and I were disgusted with it and felt it a real waste of time and energy even watching it. Yes it deals with the ever so sensitive issue of racism in a time when it was strong and it's great that perhaps because of what that guy did that it means fairer education - however this movie was not a great depiction of that in my opinion.

4164438,4,B003PAXOOQ,"This week I watched a new movie coming out by Lionsgate, The Least Among You.  It is inspired by a true story.  Inspired can mean many things, but at the very least it has given the producers of the movie the idea for the movie's story.  I tried to research what the truth is of this movie to no avail, so I'm not sure how factual it is.

My plain and simple view of this movie is that it's good--actually, it's very good.  The acting and script hold your attention from the beginning.  It never feels too slow or too fast.  There are several recognizable actors in it including Louis Gossett, Jr., William Devane and Lauren Holly.  This is a movie you can feel good about watching with your high schoolers.  Because of the story theme and content, I wouldn't recommend it for children under 13 years old as the PG-13 rating recommends.  One reviewer mentioned that there is a PG edition out, but I haven't been able to find it on the web.  I didn't notice the language, but I think this is a good movie to watch and discuss with your children--not for them to watch and process alone.  But, it's a great movie to start dialogue about life and faith with your teenagers.

The story of this movie is of a young black man who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets caught up during the Watts Riots of 1965.  As probation, he goes to an all-white seminary.  The movie centers on his struggles for acceptance and what he does in those struggles.  His journey to faith in God is very interesting and well handled. He comes to faith amidst the hypocrisy of others around him as they claim to be Christians.  This struggle is one we all live with and I think struggle with in this age of cynicism.  I think it is one that young adults today have to come to terms with more and more today.

Many reviewers commented that this film is poorly done and not well filmed.  I would disagree.  I was very impressed by it as a Christian film.  It reminds me a lot of Spitfire Grill--it is a Christian film but it doesn't shy away from this world that we live in.

I was not impressed with how the racial issues were resolved and I don't think the movie had the best ending.

I enjoyed the movie and had to examine my own heart as I asked myself how I would react or behave in the same situations the character's found themselves in.

The president of the seminary has high hopes for Richard, he would like for Richard to be such a success story that other black men would begin to follow in his footsteps. Part of the problem here is that Richard doesn't even want to be there, he would want nothing more than to finish up his probation and move onto his own dreams. Throughout the year Richard develops some very key relationships and also runs into some tough decisions that he must navigate through. You will be inspired and challenged if you can put yourself into his shoes throughout the movie.

I really enjoyed the lessons that are taught throughout the movie as you see Richard standing up for what he believes in regardless of the consequences and as you see the way he is able to respond to persecution.

Usually I don't like that many Christian films but this one was better than many others because of the content.

At this all white seminary Richard Kelly is recruited by the seminar's president as a face for face and integration.

4164446,1,B003PAXOOQ,"The Least Among You is based on a true story of Richard Kelly, a young intelligent black man, who was arrested during the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles, California. He was able to avoid prison if he attended an all-white seminary. His mother had always desired him to become a pastor. Initially, the president of the seminary had hoped he would break the social barrier, but when Kelly's ideals come up against his funding for a new technology building, the president sides against him. Kelly finds friendship and counsel in the ""gardener in the basement"" as Kelly describes Samuel Benton. In the end, Kelly is forced to make a decision: should he stand for what he believes or go against what he believes so that he might avoid going back to prison. I will leave you to guess what he chooses.

Honestly, if this movie was not based on a true story, I would have not thought it very realistic. Who avoids prison time by being forced to attend seminary? It sounds like a Seinfeld episode to me. But beyond that, this movie certainly did not paint a very good picture of Christian leadership or seminaries. I am unsure what kind of seminary it was that he attended, but they certainly questioned the authority and inerrancy of the Bible. Even at one point, the president of the seminary referred to himself as ""the one who prunes the branches,"" a reference to John 15 (where Jesus is vine and we are the branches). Certainly it does paint a picture of a moral dilemma that Kelly is faced with. Should he do what he thinks is right or coward to save himself.

I have never been very fond of too many Christian movies and this one stacks right up there. The quality was not as bad as some Christian movies I have seen, but the plot line just left me bored and not interested. It is almost 100 minutes long, 100 minutes that could be put to something better productive for your Christian life and the Kingdom of God.

The whole movie seemed very choppy, maybe a lot was edited out. I was confused about some different comments, and things that I thought they were going to expand on. I felt like they could have gone farther with a few points to get the viewer more emotionally involved. They could have done this by going deeper into the missionaries past or the president's or Kelly's, but instead they barely hit on everyone's past without going deeper. There were some weird comments between the missionary and the president that kind of left me hanging.
Overall, I like the point they were making that pain can help mold us and that the Lord chooses to prune us to make us better, but unfortunately they fell short on the ""entertaining movie"" side. It didn't really keep my attention, and didn't really pull at my emotions.

The movie is rated PG-13, and rightly so.  This movie would not be appropriate for my younger set.  Not only is the racial theme a little tense at times (which is necessary), but there is violence, blood, alcohol consumption, and lots of cigarettes.  I don't want these to be a negative cast on the movie however--the presentation of these elements certainly reflects the culture and the times (and we know that the 1960's were quite ""colorful"").

Overall I enjoyed the movie, and I would like to watch it again so that some of the ideas presented can sink in a little more.  I will admit that I'm a bit of an independent (""Indy"") film junkie.  I love movies like this that dare to take on Hollywood and wrestle with presenting the Gospel, at the sacrifice of low budgets.  I love to be able to support these film makers, in hopes that we can see more movies like this.  Yes, it's not a blockbuster and that's true, but it certainly fills my appetite for wholesome, thought-provoking, and spiritually sound movies!

The Least Among You is the story of a young black man, Richard (Cedric Sanders), who is sentenced to a term of probation at an all white seminary after harming a police officer during the Watts Riots. He appears on this campus and is immediately encouraged by the President of the seminary (William Devane) to push for the integration of the seminary. Richard also discovers that his professor Kate Allison (Lauren Holly) has served in Africa and he tries to seek her help in guidance on this endeavor.

As Richard tries his best to change the minds of his classmates, the gardener (Louis Gossett, Jr.) befriends him. The story is an excellent journey of how God works in our lives.

The film itself has its share of poorly shot scenes and some dubbed out bits. If you are interested in something wholesome, historically accurate, and uplifting to watch with the family, I would recommend The Least Among You with no reservations.

4164450,4,B003PAXOOQ,"The Least Among You is about an African-American young man who is wrongly accused of a crime and is put on probation and sent to an all White Seminary.

While there he is encouraged (somewhat) by the school President, although you see that the school wants Black followers, not leaders.

Along the journey at the school Richard Kelly meets the groundskeeper/janitor/gardener (Samuel Benton) and forms a bond with him.

Samuel teaches some life lessons to Richard which causes him to make better decisions in the end, but not before a slight confrontation with the President of the school.

During the movie there are a few references to Prostitution, Drugs, Murder.  But these seem to be there to indeed teach us life lessons and how God can help us get by those obstacles in the end.

All in all, one man goes from being accused of something he didn't do with a prison sentence lurking in the background to a life full of faith and realizes that God is the way in the end.

This movie has been rated as Family Friendly, and is a great teaching tool to show how our past can be made right by trusting in God, and doing the right things to better our society.

I highly recommend watching this movie with family as well as Youth Groups in Churches too.  You won't be disappointed that you did.

4164451,1,B003PAXOOQ,"The Least Among You was inspired by the story of Richard Kelly shortly after the Watts riots in the 60's. Kelly, as part of his probation, entered an all white seminary and was quickly thrust into the activity of change and integration.

While there is a great story underneath, the movie never brought it out. We were treated to a fairly poor Hallmark-esque depiction of the trials and struggles and accomplishments of young Richard Kelly during his first semester at the seminary. But the telling of the story was very disjointed, and left you wondering about far too much that the writer and producer I don't think meant for you to sit and wonder about (the unexplained, yet still mentioned three times, illness of the seminary dean's wife, for example).

I do not blame the low budget (you can tell) for the poor quality result. The acting was shoddy, the story was choppy and confusing, and I could not comprehend any one of the theological discussions brought up among the students and teachers. A point was trying to be made along the way, but that was sorely missed.

There were some moments in the dialogue where ""fowl"" language showed up. I was surprised; I thought they would Hallmark it up and keep it clean. I honestly don't care about that, nor am I offended at hearing it in a ""Christian"" film. I graduated from a Christian college. I heard and saw far worse.

Overall, there really is no need to watch this movie. No need for me to say anything dramatic or poetic here. Very disappointing. I gave it one star because I could not give it less.",1284940800,2,1558,4.593525179856115
4164452,4,B003PAXOOQ,"The Least Among You is a true story about Richard Kelly, a young African-American man, who enters seminary in 1965 to discover he is the only person of color there.  He is encouraged by the president to break the racial barriers, but he finds no support from professors and his roommate is the only student who will stand by him.  Richard finds a friend in the seminary's gardener, a devout man who reads the theology books the professors throw away.

The Least Among You does not have outstanding acting or directing, but it has a powerful story.  This movie would probably have never been made by a major studio, and if they had got their hands on it I imagine they would have watered down the spiritual elements in it.  This movie teaches us the importance of always standing up for what is right even if it is not the most popular thing to do.  Christians and churches for many years stood on the wrong side of the race divide.  Some believed they were doing what was right, while others may have been too scared to say anything.  Christianity not only needs to critique culture and society, but it often needs to critique itself.

Another important lesson within this movie is to show how God works through the trials of our lives.  We may look at what is happening around and think it is unfair, but perhaps we need to look again.  God not only works in our lives when times are good, but also when times are bad.  Richard Kelly endured some trials in his life unlike any we have probably ever experienced, but he remained faithful and because of that he was a better man.

4164453,2,B003PAXOOQ,"The next thing I reviewed for Thomas Nelson's Book Sneeze blog review group was a DVD titled, ""The Least Among You"".  I was very disappointed in this movie.  It is inspired by a true story, which usually makes a movie have a good storyline.  It is based on a young man, Richard Kelly, who is living in the 1960's, in the middle of racial integration.  He is arrested for a crime he says he didn't commit, and must attend a seminary for 2 semesters.  The thing he doesn't realize until he begins school is that he is the only black student at the school.  Although the premise for the movie is good, the storyline was very choppy, and left the viewer confused at many points.  There is also a point in the movie where a VERY offensive curse word is used.  This type of language should be noted in the PG-13 rating box, and it wasn't.  For a movie that quotes scripture throughout, it is very offensive to hear a curse word like the one that was spoken by the main character.  This movie, in my opinion, is not worth watching.  The storyline is too choppy, and it is definitely not a `Christian movie'.",1284940800,,1100,4.3431372549019605
4164454,5,B003PAXOOQ,"This is an excellent DVD. I like movies that are based on true stories and this one didn't disappoint me. ""The Least Among You"" was set in 1965, It tells the story of Richard Kelly -Cedric Sanders-, he's sent to an all-white seminary for 2 semesters as part of his probation at his mom's suggestion. One person who really helped Richard was a humble caretaker, Samuel Benton-Louis Gossett, Jr- The acting is magnificent.
Kate Allison-Lauren Holly- played a troubled teacher that once was a missionary. She has something in her past that is making her so sad. Parts of this wonderful movie will bring you sadness, joy, tears and leave you in awe.
To me it is so sad that people were treated so badly and it wasn't so long ago either. It should make us think what kind of people were we or are now. This movie will really get you to thinking and tell you even one person can make a difference if you only try.
I highly recommend this for your collection. We watched it twice already and have only had it a couple of days. Wonderful movie with brilliant actors.

4164455,4,B003PAXOOQ,"Based on the real story of Richard Kelly, this movie shows the transformation of a young man into a leader. Starring Louis Gossett, Jr, Lauren Holly and Cedric Sanders (plays Kelly), it is well written and well acted. Kelly reluctantly serves out a probation at an all-white seminary in order to avoid jail, and during this time is encouraged by the seminary's president to challenge the racial issues dominant in the 60's, while facing a great deal of racism in his daily life.

Kelly meets Samuel Benton, a gardener who mentors him spiritually through tough choices and difficult trials, such as the illness of his mother, whom he is financially struggling to help, the possibility of having to give up all his original dreams because of the new paths his life is taking, and facing opposition in all circles of his life, white, black, family and friends. Louis Gossett, Jr is terrific in his supporting role, and this movie is truly inspirational and real.

There are scenes of violence, racism, cuss words and more, so may not be appropriate for younger viewers (although watching it with your children to discuss some of the issues would be a great idea!) This is a really great movie.",1284940800,,1190,4.8
4164456,4,B003PAXOOQ,"This movie is based on a true story about Richard Kelly, a young black man who was caught up in the Watts riots in 1965 and accused of assault and battery of a police officer.  He had just been offered a job in business finance, but his mother had secretly applied to an all-white Christian seminary for him to attend.  Richard Kelly's attorney told him that he could get out of jail on probabtion IF he agreed to give up his dream job and attend the seminary.  He reluctantly agreed to attend the seminary.

This movie presented Richard Kelly's struggles at surviving racial prejudice from other students, professors and even the president of the seminary.  Richard meets a black gardener at the seminary who helps guide him through his many problems.

Richard also has to deal with problems back at home because his mother is very ill and she needs money for medical treatments.  The hospital requests that a $5000 down payment be made before any surgical procedure will be possible. In the absence of a father, or indeed any financial aid, Richard is forced to resort to his drug-dealing childhood friend Roscoe, for help.

It looks like Richard is almost ready to give up and leave the seminary, when he receives a divine touch and encouragement from unexpected sources.

This is an inspiring movie that is not sugar-coated or sappy.  There are times when the scenes jump from one character to another and it is a little hard to follow.  Overall, this is a good movie for family or church youth group.",1284940800,,1505,4.684410646387833

The acting was great, Louis Gossett, Jr. never disappoints. Lauren Holly, and William Devane  were also superb in their roles.  I gave it three stars due to the slightly underdeveloped story line.  The behind the scenes interviews, and special features seemed to deliver more of the message that the film somehow didn't. I would not say the movie is not worthwhile, it is.
