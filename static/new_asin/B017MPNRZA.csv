7508044,5,B017MPNRZA,"My 2 year old loved it, already singing most of the songs. She asks me everyday to put rock and roll prescholl. I sit with her to watch and sing along with her. I recommend, so far the best new wiggles dvd, oh and the wiggly holloween is good too. I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.",1462838400,,276,4.12962962962963
7508045,1,B017MPNRZA,"This DVD is such a disappointment.  My family loves The Wiggles.  We have many other DVDs from the Emma generation of the Wiggle's library.  This DVD production is sad.  The music is anything but rock & roll!  The songs lack melody and are not catchy.  Save your money!  My toddler watched 5 mins and toddler told me to turn it off!  Im so sad... we wanted to love it.

Apples and Bananas and the Animal collection has a lot more musicality and entertainment value.  Rock & Roll preschool is dead on arrival!",1462147200,2,508,4.423913043478261
7508046,3,B017MPNRZA,"This should be called, ""The Emma Wiggle Takeover"". Don't get me wrong. We are big fans of Emma. But it's just too much Emma. And almost every song uses the same set with Emma and two other dancers flanking her. I miss the older videos that encompassed a wide variety of dancing and usage of the other Wiggles. Methinks Miss Emma has become quite a diva in the last couple of years. Either that or the others have grown lazy and are leaning on her to carry the show.",1461888000,2,465,4.235955056179775

7508067,5,B017MPNRZA,"The year was 1974, and having lost their original frontman Peter Green a few years earlier, and now having lost guitar great Bob Welch, Fleetwood Mac was on the ropes.  In a stroke of genius, Mick Fleetwood asked two unknown Americans, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, to join the band, and Mac surprised everyone with its subsequent string of platinum success with its new face and lineup.
Flash forward to 2012.  The Wiggles had lost original frontman Greg Page to health issues, and while the original lineup had united briefly for the stellar Surfer Jeff collection, the classic lineup was at best a temporary fix, as red Wiggle Murray wanted to spend more time with his family and purple Wiggle Jeff, with the silver wispy hair, eyed retirement after recent heart surgery.  Simon Pryce, whose rich baritone had graced Wiggles releases as early as Whoo Hoo Wiggly Gremlins, in which he had played one of the eponymous gremlins, was already in place to step up into the red skivvy.  But how could the band survive losing not just Murray, but also Greg (again), and Jeff?  The outfit had its back to the wall.
One can only attribute what happened next to the greatest moment of musical foresight since Mick Fleetwood invited Buckingham and Nicks to join his band.  The Wiggles took on multi-instrumentalist and heart-warming crooner Lachlan Gillespie to don the purple, and in the role of the first female Wiggle, the bow-tiful Emma Watkins (a dancer by trade, but one with a lovely natural voice) stepped into the yellow.  Overnight, the band had added 3 excellent singers and songwriters.  Mr Gillespie, in particular, has a grasp of melody and lyric second to none.  With the Field brothers contributing as well their seemingly endless stream of impossibly catchy pop songs, the next generation of the band kicked off strong with the superlative Taking Off project.
Since then, the group has grown and improved with every new release.  Their latest US release, Rock and Roll Preschool, has not only some of the band's strongest popcraft (""I Went to the Library,"" ""Broccoli Bunch,"" and an outstanding ""Wake Up"") but we witness the band spreading its wings with more experimental sounds (for example, the almost psychadelic ""Goomy Galah"").  As always, there are nods to the band's past (""You Got The Drop"" reworks the classic ""The Flap""), and appreciation for traditional music (""Two Polite Elvises"").  Then there are the special guests who are actually special, not merely curios: Lou Diamond Phillips in day-glo glory on the title track, Robert Rakete adding island flavor on ""Ukulele Rock.""  But the finest track - a song genuinely moving in its exploration of mourning and loss - is the lovely ""It's Okay to Cry,"" sure to be a standard.
It's rare to see a band get a second wind that genuinely rivals its initial heyday.  The Wiggles have succeeded spectacularly at re-imagining the band for a new generation.",1464134400,15,2920,4.93265306122449
7508068,5,B017MPNRZA,"The new Wiggles have branched out from nursery and holiday songs with this newest collection. The results can be mixed for a younger fan who still finds most of ""Apples and Bananas"" to be a challenge to sing, but it's a great expansion of the group's repertoire to extend their appeal to preschoolers and slightly older kids.

There's a rock opera in ""The Story of Emma's Glasses"", catchy pop-rock in ""Wake Up!"", and an introduction to progressive rock in ""Goomy Galah"". Simon's beautiful baritone is featured prominently in ""Balla Balla Bambina"", ""Ballerina, Ballerina"", and ""Melbourne Amore"". ""I Went to the Library"" and ""Broccoli Bunch"" are among my favorites, and ""Ukelele Rock"" is delightful.

While there are some simple tunes, this album contains some of the most lyrically and musically complex songs the new Wiggles have released so far. ""Meteorology"", ""The Four Presents"", and ""Witchy-Woo"" from previous releases are comparable. This makes it one of the most enjoyable to listen to as a parent, but what do the kids think? My daughter (nearly two) enjoys watching the dancing and joining in where she can on the songs that are too tricky for her to sing, and ""Rock and Roll"" is a frequent request in the car. It took her a little while to warm up to it, but I'm pleased to say that she did, and I can see her enjoying these songs long after the novelty of previous songs like ""Big Red Boat"" wears off.",1463961600,10,1411,4.755102040816326
