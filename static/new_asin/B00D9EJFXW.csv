8590986,3,B00D9EJFXW,"I watched this movie when it came out.  It was ok at best.  Typical JCVD movie with predicable (and ridiculous) plot.  Characters are Hollywood stereotypical and trite. Costuming was decent (except for the GIANT badges they wear).  Again, ok movie... not really worth owning (unless you're a die-hard JCVD or Border Patrol fan).  One thing that bugged the heck out of me though... they have JCVD's character transfer into the Border Patrol (federal agency) from a police department (city agency).  I'm no expert, but I know it doesn't work like that; I mean, come on!",1487808000,,567,4.91578947368421
