7094485,1,B00VMIWA3O,"These people are on crack. This is an absurdly ridiculous price for a half a season of a tv show. I borrowed it from the library and am so glad I did. Within the first five minutes of the show, you see Claire being raped. Then she's beat up by Jaime. The first episode ends with her on top of him having sex while threatening him with a knife. Naturally they are both in the throes of ecstasy.

Are you kidding me? I truly don't understand why this is so popular. I didn't watch anymore after that. I don't see anything romantic about rape and domestic violence. And there is ZERO chemistry between these two. It's dry, dry, dry. The plot is also thin. This is nothing more than a rated X bodice ripper.",1429920000,59,703,4.246268656716418
7094486,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I just finished watching on Netflix the first 8 episodes on two DVDs. What is volume 2?
Is it another season or the rest of season 1? I'm so confused! Can someone please explain?",1429747200,6,178,4.264705882352941
7094487,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Watched the first volume -just had Netflix send it to me. Don't see the point in paying this much money for any tv show. Will do the same with volume 2. I have better things to do than watch something over an over as some reviewers say they do. People are silly. Sound like 5 year olds that watch Frozen 20 times. That I understand. If I wanted to watch it again NF would send it to me in one day. And no, not that I can't afford it-just think it is outrageously priced. That is 2 different things.",1429315200,11,498,4.040404040404041
7094488,5,B00VMIWA3O,I am obsessed with this show! It is absolutely the best show I've ever seen! You will not be disappointed!,1429315200,52,106,4.35
7094489,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I am pre-ordering mine today!  I have read the books over and over, watched the first half of Season 1 several times (and now my husband is addicted too).  The production - from acting to the beautiful setting in Scotland to costumes to props - is top notch!  I have the Season One DVDs (ordered from Amazon).  You are getting 8 hours of superb film (better than most movies and equal in length to about 5 movies) along with special features and special Blu-ray exclusives.  It comes in a beautiful box and the whole thing is much nicer than other television seasons I have been given!  Well worth the money -- and SO well worth the watch!!!",1429228800,66,641,4.435897435897436
7094490,5,B00VMIWA3O,This is the best TV show in every aspect on. If you pick any part of this production to study and review you will find the absolute best workers during their absolute best work of their careers. As a reader and fan of the Outlander book series I know that I am truly blessed as a fan of this show.,1429056000,128,297,3.966666666666667
7094491,5,B00VMIWA3O,"If you're read the Outlander book series, first published back in the 1990s, you'll be impressed by this TV version. Like Game of Thrones and other similar adaptations, the TV series takes some liberties and makes some changes -- but for me, the essence of the books is captured in the TV version.

Some of the main characters are well played and represented, like Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser and James ""Jamie"" MacKenzie Fraser. There is a lot going on in the books, and that complexity is a solid foundation for any TV series. Worth watching!",1428883200,114,547,4.757894736842105
7094492,2,B00VMIWA3O,"OMG! Why are these SO much money!?! I LOVE the book series, just as the next ""Outlander"" fan does. I began reading them when they first came out, many years ago, and have read the series over and over again. However, I will not pay these prices!",1428796800,61,245,4.23404255319149
7094493,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I know what you're thinking - 90 something dollars for one season of a TV show?!  Expensive yes but when I think of how many times I'm going to rewatch it's worth it.  I was so happy with the amount of extra features in Vol. 1, I'm looking forward to what Vol. 2 has in store for us.  Fans of the series will be happy with the TV adaptation.  The casting is perfect (Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser is everything) and Vol. 2 seems to be taking enough creative licence to keep fans guessing, particularly the scenes with Laoghaire.  An historical romance set in beautiful Scotland - You won't be disappointed!",1428796800,176,604,4.405405405405405
7094494,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I'm watching the first half of season one preparing for the DVD release, of course already ordered at whatever cost it takes. This is a MUST OWN, like the books. Too much happening to grasp it all in one viewing and the extras are also astounding to see. So true to the book, of course since Diana Gabaldon, the book author, keep near for approval. She too loves it, seeing her life's great creation come to life.

I admitted to my obsessive behavior toward all things Outlander. YES, I'm prejudiced. I began reading the Outlander series 1 1/2 decades ago. Now I own all books in hardcover, first editions, signed by the author. This DVD series holds to the great adventure style of the books. The books are 800 to over 1000 pages each, so plenty of material to continue DVDs for decades, beyond my lifetime, unfortunately.

In Volume 2, Caitriona Balfe continues as Claire, Sam Heughan as Jamie, tobias Menzies plays Frank Randall (a richer role than the book, actually), and the rest of the cast is just as suburb. I had my own image of Jamie & Clair from the novels, and the film stars are not the same, but they are very, very good. Cinematography, writing, costuming, props, choreography, is perfection, even down to what is NOT under the kilts. Top notch, as I knew it would be. Diana Gabaldon would allow nothing less.
Yep, this is a classic story in both book and film, you can bet your broadsword on it.

I don't hate the episodes.  I&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-Two/dp/B014CRR62G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume Two</a>
I am frustrated because I thought I was ordering a DVD.  Instead I had ordered online streaming.  OK.  My mistake.  I was given the option to ""cancel"" the online streaming and my cancellation was denied - either doing it within 5 minutes was too long a period after ordering.  Whatever the reason, my cancellation was denied.  So I decided, since it was my error that I misordered that I would try watching it online (we have a slow internet so I wasn't sure if it would work, but thought I would try).  When I went to watch it (having paid for this service), all my options to watch the movie were closed.  The only options I could select were to re-buy it again.

Could you either please refund my money or give me the permissions I need to try to watch the episodes online.  If DVD is available, that would be great!",1522627200,,1218,5.184615384615385

7094527,2,B00VMIWA3O,"Had to stop watching around Wentworth Prison. Pretty good at the beginning of the series, but it soon stopped being entertainment and turned way too sadistic. Not sure who watches that aspect of the show for fun, but it certainly stopped being something I'd consider watching to unwind. Way too much focus on graphic details. Apparently future episodes/seasons don't get much better, so we're stopping.",1522454400,,402,5.2
7094528,2,B00VMIWA3O,"The premise and story line are very interesting.  Acting is excellent.  But, unfortunately, it gets bogged down with excessive nudity, sex, physical and sexual violence, torture, blood, sadistic homosexual sodomy and rape, masturbation, and bodily functions.  One minute we are on a grand adventure and the next minute things come to a screeching halt and degenerate into much too long and explicit R and X rated scenes that do nothing to advance the plot.  Okay, we get the point.  No need to show us in excruciating detail.  A brief suggestion leaving much to the imagination and then quickly moving on with the story would have been much better.  I actually got bored waiting for the story to pick up again.  Im dropping this series and won't be watching Season Two or later Seasons.",1522454400,,786,4.857142857142857

7094587,5,B00VMIWA3O,"The last half of season 1 is definitely darker and grittier than the first and is not for the faint of heart. The quality of the production value of this show continues to be outstanding from the sets, locations and costumes to the realistic music, dialogue and accents. It truly is a unique and atmospheric experience to watch such a well done and engaging program. There are difficult to watch scenes but there are also scenes filled with dark humor, edge-of-your-seat excitement and suspense and standout performances from these truly phenomenal actors. I especially loved Laura Donnelly's portrayal of Jenny, I think she is spot on for the character and she did a fantastic job. Lotte Verbeek is great as Geillis I just wish her hair was the correct color (pale blonde or white), that's my only compliant about her! I was also impressed with Duncan Lacroix as Murtagh in Volume 2, he really did an excellent job. The season finale ""To Ransom a Man's Soul"" is hard to watch but is necessary to the plot and I commend both Sam and Tobias on their performances. However, the aftermath of Jamie's ordeal in Wentworth plays out a little differently in the book and I'm not sure how much I like the changes the show had. For instance, in the show, I think Jamie appears to recover and act like himself a little too quickly after Claire is finally able to get through to him. *SPOILERS* He takes a lot of longer to recover and Claire really has to go to some frankly disturbing lengths to get him to realize that Randall doesn't own him... the show really doesn't compare to that scene in the book in this instance. In the book he also nearly dies from the fever which was kind of glossed over in the show. I felt like the last 30 minutes of that episode were rushed and included too many flashbacks to Jamie's ordeal with Randall... showing some of what he went through is necessary but I don't think it had to be as drawn out or explicit as those scenes are. I'm personally not at all easily offended by such graphic content or by the homosexual sex/rape scenes but I do think it was a little too much and many people will be offended or at least uncomfortable. Like I said, the content in this show is not for the faint of heart; it's gory and graphic and realistic. Once again, like I will say in all my reviews for each season of Outlander, if you haven't read the books, you really should! This was my second time watching season 1 (I watched it the first time on TV when it originally aired) and this show is great for re-watching and for binge watching.",1514937600,2,2558,4.467948717948718

Regardless of which season or episode you decide to spend time watching, the chemistry between ""Jamie and Claire"" is off the charts steamy.  I guarantee you will love this...but be warned that the last few episodes are disturbing when Black Jack Randall tortures Jamie.  I skip over those episodes when I",1514592000,,566,4.783505154639175

I was literally laughing my but off when they stripped her and beat her at her witch trial. Claire is one of those women that is always in everyone business cant shut up for one minute to look and think before she speaks or acts. She is in a time period where women have no voice they are basically property so you really have to think and out wit to get your point across, she's like screw all that work your going to listen to what I have to say. I really was not a fan of her when she tried to spill the beans about Lady Louise de Rohan's pregnancy. Lady Louise de Rohan had been nothing but kind to her when she arrived to Paris and talked to her when no one would for her to even think about doing what she planned was rotten. The very first day they arrived in Pairs she got them in trouble, a the lord tried to poison her. I was not  fan when she attempted to blame Jamie for the loss of their first child She was working every day at the clinic instead of resting and getting ready to have a baby and tasting people urine, I was like is this heifer crazy! I really freaked out when she was about to go in labor and left the house to look for Jaime any other woman would be like take me to the hospital I have no time for this crap.",1512345600,,1331,3.966417910447761

7094604,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I do enjoy the series. I appreciate period period pieces and enjoy the history. And it is a fairly engrossing tale. However, as it goes on more and more I really detest the lead character, as she really is a selfish narcissist. I try to enjoy the rest of the story and ignore how she carelessly tramples everyone else, and is elevated beyond the value of every other character, and indeed, an entire clan. She IS married to two people, she DID steal a girl's childhood sweetheart, to save herself. And the man she stole, she never even intends to stay with. She really is a terribly rotten person. So I enjoy the rest of the show and the other characters, and hope she isn't rescued for the hundredth time by the people she endangers with her stupidity and loud, foul mouth, and puts in danger with her selfish choices, and never really intends to devote any loyalty to after all. (When they didn't burn her as a witch I was very disappointed.)
If an angry, paranoid, narcissistic feminist wrote a romance novel, with a woman in a torn blouse on the front cover and her rakish lover, THIS would be that story. Every man she is cheating on, or with, is a cuckolded, emasculated idiot DEVOTED to her because she's just so awesome. And every other man is a rapist. And through the entire series, she's super important while everyone else is cannon fodder for her needs. But she's the poor, always victimized damsel...
All that said, it IS an engrossing tale. Though the author clearly had some serious personal issues.",1512259200,,1515,4.573529411764706

I understand a married couple will have sex, but do we really need to watch the entire act, literally from foreplay to pillow talk to round 2? It seems to be every other episode or two, and all I keep thinking about is 'how weird it must be for these actors to have to do this very intimate act in such detail with people watching them!'.

He also would not be a fugitive or be suspected of sedition or treason. I suspect Jamie, once he got used to it, would prefer it also. Having him adjust to the 20th century instead of her adjusting to the 18th century would, I think, make for just as interesting a series.

7094651,4,B00VMIWA3O,"Most of the first season was amazing. That they put the time traveling in the back seat of the history and culture of the Scotts in the 18th century was a very original and fascinating thing to do, and it made for a great story. I personally think that the Frank and Johnathan Randall are the best characters in the series, probably because of just how amazing the actor's portrayal of them was, and how starkly different they are in spite of being portrayed by the same person.

So it's a great series. However, be warned: there is some level 11 horrible rape/torture in the last part of this season. I generally do not have a problem with dramatic depictions of sex, murder or rape. Horrible events are a large part of what connects an audience to dramatic characters and dramatic stories. But I think either the original author, or the writers for the show went a little crazy here. There was a little gore to the torture part, and the depiction of rape was not overly graphic in the sexual sense... but the level of depravity of the torture/rape stuff, and that they decided to drag it out so long in the telling of this story.

If you are sensitive to this sort of thing you should definitely steer clear. I am not very sensitive to this stuff at all in fiction, but how they portrayed it was pretty disturbing even for me.",1508198400,3,1328,4.438524590163935

7094679,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I had a hard time getting into this series at first because of the nature of having to really stretch my imagination in going along with the story line where the woman becomes transported through time in a very unusual way. Once I accepted the idea of this unrealistic  journey ""Claire"" had found herself enduring, my imagination became naturally inclined to go on the journey with her at the intrigue of how she would manage in such an unaccommodating place.  I also desired to know how her heart would fair at the loss of her husband through the transaction of time travel.

7094692,5,B00VMIWA3O,"A faithful rendering of Diana Gabaldon's book Outlander (which I have loved since it was released in the 1990s).  Ron Moore took great care to keep to the spirit of the book and it's story line.  It is filmed in Scotland and the cast is mostly Scottish and become the inner eye's version of the roles they play (even if you pictured them differently from the book).  Cait and Sam's chemistry is through the roof and they ARE Claire and Jamie to a T.  Casting was spot on! The landscape is amazing and evocative - it too tells the story.  Terry D did miracles with the wardrobe and went a long way to transporting the viewers to the time periods in the story. The music gets into your soul and thrills you. Great care was made to ensure that it was everything it should and could be.  Every contributer outperformed - can you give an award to the entire crew, cast and country? It is : Consuming.  Haunting.  Evocative.  Captivating.  Moving.  Transporting.  Don't miss it!",1503100800,,972,4.491428571428571

Until then we get to now with Starz & Tall ships production live through Jamie & Claires lives. Though massive heartache, joys, love..that is deeper then and ocean. I can not describe how this story makes me feel except "" my heart & soul have been captured""! The lead actor Sam Hueghan is AMAZING!! He captures every scene to perfection. Catarnia Balfe is just as AMAZING! Both have a natural chemistry that I have never seen before in all my years of watching shows & movies.

But whenever there is a line that's mumbled or whispered, there is no caption for it, and some of those lines are crucial to the plot.  Now I'm going to watch the end credits so I can give proper credit to the specific incompetent goldbrick who was supposed to do the closed-captioning.

Worse than the bad captioning -  The series started out good, but by the end it had degenerated into sick torture and violence porn.",1495238400,3,548,4.726315789473684

Catriona Balfe as Clair Randall and Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser give outstanding performances.  We see their struggles and triumphs (as well as some really good sex scenes).

The shows DID clarify a few things that I ""missed"" or ""didn't get"" in the books, so that was nice. If you haven't listened to the books, but liked the show, I would encourage you to listen to the series on Audible.

7094759,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I agree with other reviewers the torture and rape sections were over the top. They were bad enough in the book, but the movie lingers on it way too much. A suggestion would have been more than enough. I loved the books and find that the movie tends to skim over the strong emotional and intellectual connection of the two main character. I know that is not as sensational as violence and sex but for me it was the vehicle that carried the story. I found it particularly lacking in the Paris segment. Do please try to include more of that and less of the other. I am very doubtful about the Brie and Roger characters.",1491436800,,616,4.318965517241379

7094777,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I am an Outlander addict so I am greatly prejudiced. This series introduced me to Gabaldons main characters (I had read a Lord John book many years previously). If one has read the Big Enormous Books in her series, this covers only a small part of the first book, after  Claire's foiled escape only to  find herself again in the hands of Black Jack who intends to rape her. It is all beautifully filmed and converted me to an addict. It is however the grimmer part of that first book, ending of course with Jamie being tortured by Jack in the prison and Claire helping him escape. The Wentworth Prison scenes are extremely graphic, there is full frontal nudity, and lots of blood. There is also a twist in the story as to how Jaime ends up captured in the first place, and I felt the battle scene that replaces the original was visually accurate, and therefore distasteful. It is not something I would suggest be viewed in the presence of young children. Also first episode contains the scene where Jamie beats Claire with his belt and the makeup sex, very close to what is in the book, is very graphic and probably I wouldn't want my teenagers watching that either. Both scenes however are necessary to the later story  remaining accurate for future seasons. I love the book and the film version. I am an addict and prejuced. If one has not yet read the books though I include this waring as to viewership. You can usually find some episodes of the film on Starz, or bits of the episodes on Facebook fan groups so I would recommend exploring a bit of them before purchase if you are not familiar with the books already. As for the DVDs they do include some out takes and deleted scenes that the addict who has viewed the series on TV will appreciate.",1490054400,,1751,4.465625

7094856,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I just recently started watching this series and my first thought was this is a woman's program.  It dragged a bit as the plot developed but my patience was rewarded by a nude scene in which Caitriona Balfe, the lead actress, who played Claire Randall gave the audience extended views of her beautiful breasts. Of course, there are many handsome men in the series to keep the women interested. I am now in the middle of Season 2 and Caitriona has bared her breasts in almost all the episodes, all instances being very tastefully done.

The series is purely fictional, but considerable effort was obviously given to some historical accuracy.  The wardrobes, speech, grooming, events of the time all appear to be what you would expect in 1743 Scotland.  Claire Randall is English and is forced to adapt as an outsider into 18th century Scotland during a period of high tension between the Scot's and occupying English forces.

Season 1, Volume 2 ends with a terrible homosexual rape/torture scene that seemed to go on for an eternity.  After the first few minutes of the scene I was thinking ""enough, I get the idea"", but the scene continued on and on.  I have to give the actors and all others involved credit for producing this incredible scene.  It must have been unbelievably difficult for the actors regardless of their sexual persuasion. A series of events throughout Season 1 led up to this scene.

I am almost done with Season 2 and will be lost when it is over.  Fortunately, Starz has renewed the series for a third season which is scheduled to start in early April 2017.",1486166400,2,1579,4.688405797101449

7094900,4,B00VMIWA3O,"Sam Heughan is wonderful as James ""Jamie"" Fraser.
Heughan and Caitriona Balfe (who plays Claire Beauchamp) have great chemistry together.
Tobias Menezes is a sadistic amoral villain as Jonathan Randall.

He is extremely patient & understanding with a woman who always thinks she knows more & better than everyone else thus creating most of the problems & obstacles in the story.  That can stretch credulity too often.

Few Scots were Roman Catholic in 1743 though some Presbyterians did convert to Roman Catholicism so it is strange that the village church is headed by a ""priest"" who uses a crucifix and makes the sign of the cross.  Otherwise, the story seems well-researched, but I haven't found any sources supporting Roman Catholicism in the Highlands.",1485648000,,757,5.130081300813008

I have enjoyed the series in every way except that I don't understand why when you look up these DVD's on Amazon it only lists Sam Heughan and Graham McTavis as actors at the top, and as the stars in the show. This show CLEARLY stars Caitriona Balfe, who plays Claire, and does a fabulous job.

I have read the books. But I was not expecting the level of reality of the suffering of one man and the depravity of another.  Season two of Outlander, the second half of the first book in the series, is worth watching again and again. Starz has a winner with this series, and it's been picked up for two more seasons.",1485043200,,488,4.304347826086956
7094944,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Whereas the first volume showed the darker side of Scottish history and tidbits of how the Jacobite Rebellion would come to be, this volume shows the darker side to marriage too many don't like to face- particularly how far one would go to save a loved one.
From volume 2's opening to the last moment of the season finale, I was engrossed (even with the gross gay sex scene). There's not just cringeworthy violence, erotic sex scenes, etc., I mostly enjoyed the deep psychology of the show. The psychology of the most controversial episode had me thinking the hardest. How to save a man when his mind has been twisted along with his body? That angle had me impressed beyond what I expected.
This had me thinking it was like the Scottish modern interpretation of Song of Solomon- the good, the bad, the ugly of marriage.
The season is worth rewatching for all the layers, the reverse foreshadows, how well acted Tobias Menzies was as a man and his ancestor, and especially the laugh-out-loud wit of both Claire and Jamie.",1485043200,,1020,4.6722222222222225

The one thing we all agreed upon was that the Outlander would make a great TV mini series.  It just took 23 years for that to happen.  Now I am the only one left, counting the days and months till season 3 starts up and book 9 gets released.  I hope Starz does all the books with the great action, laughter, love and two hearts that beat as one.  We have encouraged readers to read the books first before they sat down to watch the Starz production of Outlander, The books always has more in them then a TV show. Yet the TV production gives life to the main lovers in the book.  I am no good at giving a review just know if you read the books you will find out what happens to Murtoag on Colloud fields were death not life stand out as any Scots did not walk off that field of blood.",1484006400,,895,4.0

7095043,4,B00VMIWA3O,"Something bothered me about this season (aside from the obvious, the last 2 episodes). I went back and read the book closely. Some things were left out that really made  the book better. For example in the book after the beating episode, Clair and Jamie spent time together talking and ended up rolling on the ground laughing. None of the petulance shown in the TV movie. Second, in the movie after Clair decides to stay with Jamie she stands over him snapping ""get up soldier"". NOT in the book where their reunion was much more tender. Little things mean a lot. Same problem with Season Two though I am currently reading ""Dragonfly in Amber"" to check.",1483920000,,652,4.620689655172414

7095049,1,B00VMIWA3O,"This series ended up being more like a gory porno than a love story. Clair is all too often on the verge of being raped, by captain Randal, by Dugal, and various British officers. The sex scenes are WAY OUT of bounds for family viewing. The language is terrible and story line is one continuous victimization after another. I kept holding on thinking the story would turn out ok but the last episode left me feeling sick to my stomach and dirty. The images are forever seared in my mind. The only thing I can say is that only a very sick mind would be capable of writing such a twisted story. It could have been amazing but instead I hated it. Don't we have enough violence in the world, enough murder, enough rape, must every movie be disgusting too? I am sending the second season back- the first season was garbage for the mind.",1483747200,6,831,4.367741935483871

7095221,4,B00VMIWA3O,"More of what I wrote in my Volume One review except the heroine is beginning to migrate into unrealistic territory as a do-all, be-all as she struggles to adapt to her new life and love. The evil Brits are coming down hard on them all, the land is full of Scottish collaborators, and her squeeze, Jaime, becomes a hunted man so they have to ultimately sail off to France in the end.

As always there are some hard scenes to watch depending on your bent but the overall action and tension are pretty much carried over from Volume One. But the novelty begins to wear for me thus dropping it down a star. There's a lot of Clare/Jaime fighting followed by kiss and make-up filled in between by sword and musket play that begins to become repetitious. Taken as a whole however it's still a fine series.",1480464000,,797,4.421768707482993

I simply can't find the words to convey how very splendid is the acting, directing, Highland scenery (which is a character in and of itself and central to the story) and how very rich the story line is.  I am reading the first book in the Series and the show is pretty true to the original story and it's dialogue. The main characters are so deep and well developed.

7095233,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Like so many other I have fallen in love with Outlander. He story is written and portrayed in a way where you feel like you are apart of the action. You can feel for Clair and her struggle to regain her life with her husband Frank and the undeniable pull she has tward Jamie.
The filming locations that were closed for the series were done so with care, the beautiful Scotland countryside is like another character brought to life.
I am both a fan of the Starz series as well as a fan of the books. Now there are descrepancy between the books and the actual tv series. I know this is frustrating, but Starz has added director commentary after each episode. This has helped not only explain parts of the episode but it also helps address the decrepancys with the Book series.",1479686400,,774,4.419580419580419

I haven't read the books but if they are anything like the dramatization, for readers, GET THE BOOKS. I don't excited generally about much, but this series has blown me away. It is the single reason we pay for Starz! There is a cliffhanger @the end of every episode, even some that take your breath away, or make you angry. Jamie is the man every woman wants to see in her man. His commitment, bravery, sacrifice, and all the other things men and women like equally. The writers, producers, director, cast, production team, etc. Hit the bullseye on this work. Believe me, if you are human and have a heart, you will LOVE OUTLANDER.",1478304000,,802,4.818840579710145

7095331,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Great series.  I read the books before I decided to watch the series because I found most series or movies do not follow the books.  I was pleasantly surprised with Outlander.  Even though there are subtle differences in the series than the book, they aren't things that deter from the overall end product.  The series does stay pretty true to the books but with a few variations.

I do have to mention one thing that bothers me with casting in the series.  If you are an avid Outlander reader as I am, you notice things.  Some of these things are, Claire's eye color and Jenny's eye color.  The book states a number of times the ""amber color"" of Claire's eyes but her eyes are brown, nothing significant, in the series.  Jenny's eyes are blue in the book, in fact, they are the bright blue like Jamie's, but they are also brown in the series.  Wouldn't you have the actresses use colored contacts to make the impact and follow the book?  Obviously not.

I know there isn't a lot to say about the series that hasn't already been said, but this series is very graphic.  The violence, situations, and sexual scenes are graphic.  This is not a series for the faint-of-heart, so if you're at all squeamish about these things, do not watch, or fast forward through the icky parts.

This is truly an epic series.  The books are larger than life and are absolutely wonderful to loose yourself in.  The characters are loveable and the dialogue is witty and engaging.  Love the books and now I'm hooked on the series.",1477785600,3,1508,4.522222222222222
7095332,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I loved the Outlander books and the series does a very good job of following the books- a little too good, at times. I don't understand why they felt it necessary to show full frontal nudity so frequently or full-on rape scenes in graphic detail. I get that it was part of the book, but reading about it and seeing it are two different things, and I don't know why they feel it necessary to nearly make the series rated X. The storyline itself is true to the books and I love the characters, I just think they could stand to tone down some of the sexuality. You can't erase the sexuality and stay true to the books, I know that, but it doesn't have to be so overt.",1477785600,,664,4.155038759689923

7095387,2,B00VMIWA3O,"I truly loved the books.  I accept that film has to make some changes.  Given that, I feel very strongly that the direction, and screen writing of the stories consistently misses the mark.  It has been a huge disappointment.  I will say that set, costume, cinematography and casting are great  -  maybe even above and beyond.  That, sadly, adds to the disappointment in the adaptation of the stories for film.

PS - the book was pretty highly sexed anyway - was it really necessary to add even more?  There is some art to understatement on occasion!

Still love the books",1476921600,3,571,4.62

7095409,5,B00VMIWA3O,I'm very impressed. I was excited about season 2. As is true in book to t.v. some changes were needed to make it work.

7095410,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This show is like a well-written romance novel on television.  The plot lines are interesting and even thought-provoking (in terms of thinking about how human behavior is so often emotionally driven).  The leading characters are appealing.  The sex scenes are very sensual, erotic, and emotionally passionate.  I love the musical score and the inclusion of gorgeous panoramic views of the land.

The premise of a woman transported back in time and then facing challenges and finding love, caught my interest and kept it.  The actors do a great job, which also creates a high quality show.

7095441,5,B00VMIWA3O,"My cable was off around 2 am, (which is often the case with Xfinity), and at that time of night/morning I am usually so frustrated with not being able to sleep I forget I can watch movies on Prime. So, I decided to go through some DVD's I borrowed from my mom, in which I am most certain I purchased this for her or my grandmother from Amazon. Finding this, I figured it would be perfect enough to loll this unfortunate insomniac straight to sleep. On the contrary! I was hooked with the first episode. I didn't get any sleep that night or the next due to being glued to my television set. And wouldn't you know, the day before finding this gem I had Starz turned off the cable because I never watch it. I now have Starz from Amazon and it's $11 cheaper!
The story-line holds my undivided attention (not that I normally have all that much going on at 2am); the costumes, characters and scenery are absolutely beautiful and the acting is superb. (I never use the word superb, hmm) Highly recommend NOT to watch at 2am, unless that's your thing.

I was however drawn into the story around episode 3 (first two episodes were quite slow) it impressed me with the historically accurate names, places and period dress. A great deal of research was certainly required to pull that off.

Lots of action as well. The sex scenes (of which there are many) are a bit gratuitous and oft have little to do with scene development. Certainly not child appropriate due to that. But give it a chance.",1476144000,,563,4.509803921568627

And by all means it is scy fy  heance she traveled back in time. But to be honest they make you feel like you're at home with the characters. You can realate or see things that just make the film a snuggle film. It Got a little bloody of sorts but it seamed real. I must say my hats off to the man jammy.

7095470,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I am with the hundreds of thousands of people around the world that are glued to the Outlander Series.  The masterful story teller, Diana Gabaldon has put forth the most riveting, account of Scottish and American history encompassing Claire, an intelligent young ""modern"" woman with medical acumen from the 1940's and Jamie, a handsome young, Scottish Highlander clansman from the 1740's weaving them and their family and friends through the survival of disasters and wars while developing the most sincere and tender love story between the two of them. She's managed to make a truly believable narrative of a woman who accidentally falls through time from the 1940s to the 1740's into the colonial mores and values of people of that time.  Claire struggles with how people lived two centuries ago and how she may be able to apply her knowledge of medicine and history and perhaps change the time-line to help the people she loves in the 1740's while dealing with concern about Frank, her husband, desperately searching for his missing wife during their second honeymoon in Scotland after the end of WW II.",1475884800,,1106,4.972972972972973

7095578,1,B00VMIWA3O,"This was one of those the wife and I would watch together one episode at a time.  While it danced along the razor's edge of tastefulness with it's explicit sex scenes, the romance, drama, action, and period setting made it tolerable...that is until season 1 volume 2's conclusion.  We kept watching, hoping we were misunderstanding the homoerotic torture fueled scene that ended volume 2 - but we didn't.  It's really quite sad, the series had so much potential...but lost it, to trying to out ""gross-out"" GoT.  Season 1 volume 2 manages to be exceed GoT's explicit depictions, but in doing so fell off that razor's edge with predictable consequences, and it's why we've thrown the DVD's out and won't watch another season.",1474848000,,723,4.901639344262295

Fascinating story from the books of Diana Gabaldon, but this production puts her work into a fabulously done visual production.  The stars Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan are beyond exceptional.  They absolutely make the book characters come to life!  The vistas of Scotland itself are gorgeous.  Diana's story just pulls you IN and you are totally enamored with the characters.

Sam Hueghan, who plays Jamie Fraser, is gorgeous but he's not just a pretty face, he is an excellent actor also. My only complaint of the show is Caitriona Balfe. She looks much older than her character, Claire, is supposed to be. She looks much older than Sam. At times she looks more like his mother than his lover.",1474156800,,396,4.293333333333333

7095643,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I found Outlander quite by accident. I had never read the books the series is based on and to be frank historical fiction isn't one of my favorite genres. However Outlander is so much more than just that. Perhaps it's the added element of time travel that drew me in or the amazing chemistry of the cast, in particular Caitriona Balfe, Sam Heughan, and Tobias Menzies that makes it a must watch for me.  All the acting is brilliant, but Menzies must be commented as he plays not one, but two characters who are so very different in temperament.  I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen the series to watch it and not just one episode. I promise you'll be glad you did as you become as loyal a fan as I am.",1474156800,,706,4.3007518796992485

Jamie is absolutely fantastic, down to his smile - exactly how I envisioned him from the book.

7095754,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Season 1 - Volume Two of Outlander is gritty, realistic, sometimes hard to watch. Cinematography, writing, costuming, is perfect...a magnificent production. A fantastic adaptation  of Diana Gabaldon's book series.  Scotland scenery is spectacular!

I'm totally enamored with the show. Wonderful heart wrenching, captivating story involving you to the point where the characters seem so real you feel a sense of loss when not seeing them. This motivated me to read Voyager,which is based on Season 3.  Also to take further interest in Scotland's history.

Beautifully written, breathtakingly filmed. Outlander transports viewers to a time and place of brutality  and passion. A mixture of romance, history, adventure, violence, sex and evil. The acting is truly the best I've ever seen. Caitriona Balfe as Claire, Sam Heughan as Jamie are superb, as are all cast members. Amazing onscreen chemistry between Claire and Jamie. Truly feel the love between them. Words of love Jaime speaks are so heartfelt they give you chills! He is a proud Scottish warrior/hero and tender lover. Claire the strongest of female characters.

The last two episodes were tough to view.  Very disturbingly realistic depiction of Jaime's torture and rape. Psychological effects were explored in depth. Jamie and Claire struggle through these two episodes, coming to terms with the aftermath of evil but it is an incredible testament to the power of love.

Questioned weather I would be able to continue watching after the last episode but pleased I did because the series is greatly rewarding and thought provoking.",1473206400,4,1591,5.332

It came across as an actual event a mystical experience.  He made it real.  Treated it with grace if you will.
I was glad to see that it was not  made into a si fi show as that would have not been appropriate ar all.  Not that I don't care for su fi because well done si fi I do like and this director is excellent at well done, no excellent done si fi.  I just don't think for this series it would have been appropriate.  I love that he made it a magical, mystical experience and throughout the series brought out that side of the highlander culture by addressing the spiritual side as well as and while in keeping with the historical events and daily strugles of Scotland at that time as I hear the book which the series is based on do also.
Also love the actors but really miss Dougal!  Just recently met him and he's 100% Scot in real life as much as the charector he plays.  Awesome actor along with the rest of the cast.
If you haven't seen Outlander do yourself a favor & get it.

I was not even aware of the books until after watching the series - so found myself doing a lot of summer binge reading,
I've just completed ""The  Fiery Cross"" and am about to start ""A Breath of Snow & Ashes"".
Part of me wants to slow down because Jamie & Clare are now older and I must prepare for their demise.....
I'm just not ready for that.
Sam & Cait are prefect for the roles of Jamie & Clare and deserve nods for their acting.
The scenery is breathtaking - I could go on - just watch & see for yourself.",1472774400,,629,3.952755905511811

They pushed the boundaries WAY too far.  I loved this Outlander series at first.  I will not buy any future series.  I had the entire book series in my cart and just took it off.  Lost my sale.  This series has many borderline porn scenes.  Blow jobs, crouch eating, nipples almost being cut off with knives, T & A everywhere.  At first I tolerated it because I loved the story, costumes, setting.  But after the brutal man on man rape scene that went ON and ON and ON and ON with flashbacks, I will no longer buy this series.  They made it hard to skip this violent and disgusting rape scene and strung it out over the best part of the last episode.

I devoured Season One - Volume One - However they could give no date for when Volume two would be available - so I decided to check out Amazon-Prime and there was a brand new email from Amazon Prime offering up a free 7-day trial for their new ""best-Buddy -> STARZ""! And STARZ just happens to have Season One-Volumes 1&2 AND Season Two-Volume-One!!! I have been in Outlander Heaven for the past 2 days! The sets, the costumes, and most of all - the Actors are absolutely Beautiful! And, being man or woman, you are going to LOVE this couple! Oh, did I mention The SeX?  There is also quite a bit of Blood and Violence, but I believe they offset the horror of it very well. Just when you think you can NOT take their pain another second, you are given relief with a scene change. The only thing I fear is that it seems like every time a really awesome series comes around, the networks cancel it!

7095920,2,B00VMIWA3O,I'm trying to get through this series but it's not easy.  For all the plot twists it seems that the main characters maintain the same handful of facial expressions and vocal dynamics throughout which is disappointing.  I want to like these people because the basic premise and setting of the story is intriguing.  But.  They're kind of dull. I blame the script and the production for not giving us depth in these characters but instead lingering way too long on anxiety provoking set-ups.  I mostly fast forward through a lot of the predictable action wondering if we will ever see another side to these characters.,1471305600,,615,4.819047619047619

7095954,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I've heard so much about this series over the years - with several friends just gushing over them.  I read the first book and it was ok.  Not a big fan - it's long - its weighty - and to be honest, I am just not a fan of the whole 'time travel'  thing.  I've yet to read a book that has a time travel theme that I love.

But I kept hearing how great the series was.. so I had to do it..  I watched the first episode and thought 'meh'  - but then kept going through the series. It did pick up for me - I do think it is very well made - well acted.  Jamie is just adorable and Sam Heughan is well cast and he is just utterly charming.  I find Claire rather annoying but I'll put up with her to be able to watch Jamie... Great attention to detail for a period piece.  Pretty heavy on the history so if that is not your thing - you may have trouble with it.

I've noticed that i am not obsessed with watching it like I currently am with a couple of other series - I am fine to watch an episode then drop it and not watch another for a week or more.  Whereas I will watch others episode after episode till all hours of the night -  so that confirms my rating,  I like it - but I don't love it.. Except for Sam - him I give 5 stars to... ;-)",1470787200,2,1235,3.7364341085271318

Very high production standards, very realistic (apart from the initial time-travel), and a treat to watch.

However, toward the middle - end of volume 2 is where it really caught my interest. It speaks of such a deep soul love I believe most women dream of having. It's a love that carries power & great mysteries. Now - I absolutely LOVE Outlander!!! I ordered both volumes & it was supposed to be here today. Email notice -delay E.T.A. Aug 9th. Because I am new fan of Outlander is the only reason it's getting a 5 star!!!",1470441600,,566,4.299065420560748

The graphic action is difficult to watch and not for folks who are super sensitive to violence, but it is true to the book and very realistic.  Gabaldon's writing is so true to the history of Scotland and the Scottish people.  I hope they continue to produce the film version of the rest of the story.",1470441600,,453,4.475609756097561

7096077,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Led by Sam Heughan as Jaime Fraser and Caitriona Balfey as Claire Beauchamp Fraser, this excellent series is a faithful rendering of Diana Gabaldon's brilliant books and historical research.  Set in both modern (1945-1975) and medieval times (1745-1775) , the series offers a blend of remarkably accurate history, strangely convincing time-travel fantasy, and a lyrical sensuality of physical love.  The strong central characters are surrounded by a rich tapestry of events and supporting cast, several of whom have won awards for their dramatic work.

Watching Outlander and reading the books on which it is based, led me to understand for the first time, the context surrounding the Scots ""rising"" of the middle 18th century, when Bonnie Prince Charlie attempted to take back the English throne for his Catholic father. The series is unsparing in its revelations of Prince Charles' utter incompetence for the role, and of the unbridled brutality of the English Protestants in suppressing the rebellion.

Due to frequent bloody violence consistent with the period and highly erotic sexuality that molds the characters, this is decidedly adult entertainment.  That said, my wife and I eagerly await the release of Season Three in Fall 2016.",1469750400,,1240,5.338461538461538
7096078,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This historical romance is beautifully filmed in the Scottish highlands. It depicts a life dominated by the Scotch clans as they struggle with England, represented by the red-coated English army.
  The main character, Claire, is an English nurse, and we meet her right after WW II as she and her husband begin a new post-war life together. She has just committed herself to this new life when she finds herself thrust 200 years back in time. Her knowledge of history, her husband's genealogy, and medical arts are all important elements in the plot of this complex drama. Be prepared for plenty of raw sex and violence, 18th century style.
  I loved the story, the scenery, the 18th century costuming, the history lesson, and--being a woman-- the wonderful body of the male lead, Jamie, an 18th century Scotch warrior and Claire's lover.",1469664000,,837,4.914893617021277

I had to stop watching at the end of the season because of the  (spoiler alert) very disturbing rape scenes which I could not get out of my head, actually making me feel sick. They  continued with flash backs and I could take no more... then came the increasingly self righteous attitude of the main characters eventually resulting in not liking them anymore.

Writers did an excellent job of taking Gabaldon's rather outrageous yet somehow believable premise to the screen. The casting and sets are fantastic.

7096378,2,B00VMIWA3O,Liked some of it.  Hated the scenes in the prison.  There was no reason to be so graphic nor to drag it out so long.  We fast forwarded through a lot of those scenes and were seriously considering dropping the series.,1468022400,2,217,4.2439024390243905
7096379,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I watched the first 1/2 of Season 1. This is the second half, the  continuing story of Claire (who's on the selfish
side) & slightly younger Jamie who's coming into his own. At times I wondered- did Claire deserve Jamie's
devotion?

The Red Coat officer known as ""Black Jack"" was rotten to the core.  His character was sadistic toward  Jamie & ultimately raped him- these scenes could have been brief, implied w/o  the gory details or left out completely. But controversy generates interest which generates TV ratings? I have not seen such a detestable character portrayal since Ronald Merrick in Jewel in the Crown on PBS.

I realize this TV experience (now on DVD)  was based on a series of time-travel romance books. But it strains credibility that Black Jack would miss the notice of his commanding officer or the jail warden while subjecting Jamie and others to his nefarious actions.

The leads had chemistry, but I think the other characters w/ their quirks & power-plays made this story come alive. And gave it texture. I don't have a huge screen TV, so only about 50% of the subtitles were visible.",1468022400,3,1107,4.7591623036649215

7096382,2,B00VMIWA3O,I watch The Walking Dead and I found this show to be more disturbing with the graphic violence towards women AND men by playing up a sadist character.

7096409,1,B00VMIWA3O,"Because of my own Scottish-Irish-Viking heritage I was really looking forward to this series. But after watching volume 2 not only am I seriously disappointed, I am THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED! The type of behavior, exhibited by ""Black Jack,"" has no remote resemblance historically and since the book series is fictional, the mere presence of the content is solely at the desire of the author and show's producer. I do realize that this may be the type of material others wish to observe but seeing is how it is an absolute assault on my own personal values I see no reason whatsoever to continue to watch the series any further.

Of Note: this may be the very reason why the series is only available on STARZ and no longer available on Amazon.",1467590400,3,737,4.6692307692307695

7096505,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Initially I checked this series out at the Library, because it looked interesting.  I fell in love with it immediately!  I had to own it, so I bought it from Amazon.  The second season is currently under way on Starz, but I don't have cable.  I can't wait to see season 2!  The story is based on the books by Diana Gabaldon.  Her Outlander series currently totals 8 books.  I have started to read the series.  Each book is over 600 pages long, so it will take a while.  The TV series does an excellent job of following the characters and scenes written in the books. However, I do find the TV series more enthralling, because the characters are much more animated with their Scottish accents, which is not as clearly indicated in the books.  The first season (Volume one and Volume two) only covers the first book Outlander.  The story line is interesting, because it throws a married woman for 1945 into a dangerous Scotland in 1743, under British rule.  She is a head-strong independent modern woman who has to come to terms with 1743 society where women were in constant peril and had little say or control over their own lives.  She initially finds herself in the position of being suspected as a spy by both the Scottish clan that is keeping her, and by the British. In order to protect her from the evil hands of her 1945 husband's ancestor, the clan decides it would be best for all concerned if she married Jamie, who is a relative of the clan's leaders.  She struggles with the morality of being married to two different men, from two different times, but does her best to cope with her current situation, when all she really wanted was to find a way home.  Under the circumstances, she starts to fall in love with her new husband, but Scottish life continues, with its ups, downs, and political intrigues, and she continues to serve as the healer (because she is a nurse) for the clan. Because she is from the future, she also has some knowledge of events that are about to unfold that may be used to help the clan she is with, especially since she is now a member of it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-One-Blu-ray-UltraViolet/dp/B00RLK35H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume One (Blu-ray + UltraViolet)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-Two-Blu-ray/dp/B00VMIU3CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume Two [Blu-ray</a>]",1466812800,4,2505,5.2275

7096524,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I recently got turned on to this show and started binge watching the back episodes.  OMG!  This show is great!  Some of the dialog is hilarious, especially from Angus and Rupert.  Other aspects are tragic.  Frankly, this show regularly has me in tears during the sad parts.  The love story of Claire and Jamie is epic.  Jack Randall is the most horrifying villain to come along in some time.  All of the actors and actresses are first rate in my opinion.  The scenery in the Scottish Highlands is glorious.  I'm so glad I found this show.  I've started reading the books now too to fill in any details that the TV show may have omitted due to constraints of time and budget.  A caveat for parents, though.  There are many aspects of this show that are very violent as life in the Highlands was violent during this time period.  I won't give away any plot points, but some things cannot be unseen once you see them.  There is also quite a bit of nudity and sex being depicted.  It all goes with the story, but this is definitely not for children.",1466726400,10,1045,4.392670157068062

7096566,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I just read Outlander and learned of it's existence recently, so this review is late to the party. But based on that book, the few episodes I've seen from each of the seasons, and the reams of comments on the books and television episodes, I feel motivated to leave this review because there are far more outstanding ones than this series deserves. I liked it for the nostalgia factor with a nod to the bodice rippers I read in my youth. Because this is essentially an historical romance. Yes it has time travel, but it is an underdeveloped idea. I don't have a problem with the sex scenes, that is after all, the reason de atre of the whole production. The problem with them is that callow actors don't know how to do convincing sex scenes yet.  I'm not saying I didn't enjoy watching them, but I overlooked the dress rehersal feel and read into them what I wanted. Claire breathes like she's got consumption and climaxes almost as soon as Jaime touches her, for instance. I'm sure it's difficult to do sex scenes in front of a crowd and I sympathize, but I'm not the one getting paid for it. Sam H. is the better actor here, in my opinion, but at times there is still something missing. I'm not trying to blame it all on Caitriona. But I like Sam in his character better than she in hers. Even though he is not what you'd expect based on the description of Jaime in the books. Meanwhile, other characters that are acted very well are also under utilized. Though the actors do have some chemistry, you can tell the movements are contrived. Compared to say, The Lover, in which to this day people will try to claim the sex was real. I strongly believe Sam H. is gay, but that is irrelevant....because he is an actor. I was temporarily enthralled with Outlander. Love the Scottish hero, the time travel, the brotherhood of the clan and the adventure. The basic premise is really good. But the writing is mediocre. Plots elements are thrown in willy nilly,  unnecessary problems and convenient resolutions abound. I wish the producers of the show would have taken more control  and improved the story to it's potential. I wasn't sure about Sam H. for his role at first, but he grew on me quickly. In fact he's the main reason I watched as much as I did. Catriona B. is good in her role, but something about her feels insincere. It's not awful, it's just not great. I think it's partly incomplete character development. There's a lot of talk of how Claire is a strong female character. But not nearly enough mention of how annoyingly often she does stupid, selfish things that get Jamie captured and tortured. There is absolutely no attention paid to her adjustment to life in the 18th century. Speaking of violence. This author has a sick fascination with the gruesome. I have a problem with that right from the start, but then she throws it in gratuitously half the time. Like the infamous scene where Black Jack tortures and rapes Jaime. The rape could have been a strong plot point but important information like Jack's motivations are not explored and the extreme violence doesn't make sense. Even if it were important to the story, no one but an actual sadist wants to see that. Poor Jaime. At any rate, as others have pointed out, it would have been better to leave much of that to the imagination if it had to be there at all.

As for the spanking scene: I cannot believe the number of people who are outraged over this. Its ridiculous. He didn't punch her in the face for god sake, he did not beat her within an inch of her life, as I think she claimed in the book. He spanked her. People pay for that. Granted, that is a consensual transaction and granted it was with a belt. But still, haven't any of the outraged ever read a Rosemary Rogers book? (I think the author has, Outlander is basically Sweet Savage Love in Scotland except Jaime is a nicer hero. )  And if you have read SSL, please go on down to the Goodreads comments. Worth it. ) I would be more upset over the gratuitous horror show that was Jaimes torture by Black Jack in prison and the excessive, near- fatal floggings the poor guy got. And Im just speaking of the book, I couldn't bring myself to watch it depicted. Im not saying non-consensual spanking should be a regular part of a relationship, but I am saying she deserved this one and I don't feel bad for her. I liked the scene but agree with others that the music didn't quite work.  Only because it felt like they couldn't decide whether to go humorous or dark and so split it down the middle and each element got short changed. Still hot though.",1466380800,5,4579,4.464755077658303

The costumes and set designs were incredible and the acting top notch.
My only criticism would be that sometimes the Gaelic accents were hard to understand and I wanted subtitles. Also, there are times when I wanted the story to move a bit faster but it seemed to lag in parts. Overall and excellent production and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1466380800,,644,4.466101694915254

7096581,4,B00VMIWA3O,"A gritty, taut, yet hopeful story that's not afraid to also be romantic . . . something of an antidote to the current slew of excellently-wrought, yet grim, nihilistic TV series fare.  Wonderful sets, costumes, and general evocation of period back up an excellent script and top-drawer acting.  The casting is spot-on too.  Tobias Menzies in particular deserves awards for a performance of astonishing breadth.

Outlander does slip briefly in brief moments of cheesiness - but only here and there, and invariably makes up for it within a few scenes.  Also, the distaff perspective is refreshing and still not portrayed often enough in the current TV series renaissance.  Those who like girls will have no argument with Caitriona Balfa, and Sam Heughan is her worthy counterpart.

Overall, good-to-excellent and highly recommended.",1466294400,,830,5.290076335877862

I watched the first two halves then bought the books and have read everyone of them. I am now going back to watch the first season again because there is so much more you can understand after you have read the books.

I have read all of the books.... so I am surprised at how much I LOVE the series so far!!! Usually it is disappointing to see a movie or TV series based on books if one has read them beforehand. Not the case at all here.

They did an outstanding job with casting. The writing is superb and in sinque with the books, probably because Gabaldon herself wrote the screenplay. The cinematography is breathtaking. I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying Outlander immensely, even if you haven't read the books!

7096648,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Ahh, the fabulous show known to me as ""tits-out-lander"". Actually my wife purchased this. I was working away on an edit and came downstairs to grab a drink, and there on the TV was a fabulously elegant and beautiful Irish lady, with her apparel all amiss astride some male-model type. For weeks after that, it seemed I had some strange mental radar - I'd have a sudden urge to get an iced tea, a scotch, some cheetos, and when I passed my lovely wife watching TV, there was - again!!! - that same pair of white Irish bosoms on screen. I asked her if this show was just straight-out softcore porn, but no - she said ""your timing is just really good"".

I am now developing a phone app. Anytime your wife is mooning over the romance of time travel - the emotional intensity of loving not one but TWO good men (and one of them is IN ANOTHER ERA OF TIME!!!) - the fantastical sight of brawny, handsome lads in kilts... the deep declarations of manly love to their well-bosomed Irish lasses - an alert will sound when Caitriona's corset hits the floor. I can't rely on this radar forever after all.

UPDATE: guys, avoid the, umm ""prison scene"". Apparently, prisons have been about the same for millennia, especially for pretty male-model-types. Owie. Thank god I was warned!",1465948800,5,1268,4.532751091703057

7096655,2,B00VMIWA3O,"I have been binge-watching season one of the show and I have to say I am quite disappointed. My experiences with the books has been excellent; I bought the first books when they came out way, way back when and eagerly awaited each new book. So, when the show was announced, I yelled yippy!

I should have kept my yips to myself.

For instance, the show episodes are only ""loosely"" based on the books. So, so many things are different, or even just plain wrong. I won't go into any great detail because fans of the books and fans of the shows will know what I mean. I understand screenwriters have to make concessions because they cannot do exactly as the books are written. I know they have material and/or physical constraints. However, at least two-thirds of the books are cannibalize for the sake of the Starz shows.

But one glaring difference was the wedding. I was extremely disappointed to see that Frank and Claire were married at the local City Hall, and not at the quaint ancient church as stated in the book. I wanted to see her reaction when she went to the same place with Jamie. Another difference was I also wanted the courtroom scene to be faithful to the book. None of it was true. It would have been wonderful to see Jaime ride up on his horse and throw the jet-bead rosary on her to land just-so.

As I stated, too many differences. If you watched the shows without having read the books, they would stand alone and be fine---IF you do not mind watching nudity on a grand scale almost every time Jamie and Claire kissed or touched each other. Not my cup of tea. I fast forwarded. They should have been rated R, not MA.

Ms. Gabaldon, you have been a comfort to me on many sleepless nights while I read your books. And read them so often I had to buy them again and again, until the Kindle came along. I will continue to buy your books. However, I do wish the shows had remained true to the stories you tell about a lovely girl and her fairy tale prince come to life.",1465862400,7,1985,4.339622641509434

7096679,2,B00VMIWA3O,"The writing is pathetic.  For example, episode 1 has Jaimie screwing Claire for 20 minutes.  The last episode has Randal sodomizing, etc. Jaimie for another 20 minutes.  It looks like the director  told them to just keep it going while he waited for the writers to come up with some/any idea to move the plot  along.
This period of Scottish history is rich in plot material.  Get some better writers before daring to venture forth with Volume 3.  The alternative would be to keep the same writers, and move subsequent seasons/volumes of the Outlander over to the Porn channel.
On the positive side, the settings and costumes are first rate, as are the supporting actors.
Is it my imagination, or is Jaimie gay?  Are the writers gay?

7096728,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I enjoyed the books so much, I've read them three times. I was hoping the video series would be just as good, and  it is in many ways - great choice of actors to portray characters, does a good job of representing the story line without too many changes, and the changes made do not change the story in any way. My complaint, and why I can give this only 3 stars, I am not a voyeur.  I do not enjoy watching other people engage in sex, I think the ""illusion"" is much more romantic and effective. Blatant nudity and sex  is more on the lines of the Playboy channel and does not do the book any credit. Yes, the book has sex in it, but reading about it (which I also don't do a lot of) and seeing it our two different things.  So all that being said - The video stays true to the story, I think most Outlander fans will enjoy it ... voyeurs definitely will.  I just have to fast forward through all those scenes to get back to the story.",1465430400,3,935,4.032432432432432
7096729,1,B00VMIWA3O,"Warning - while this is for the most part has been a brilliantly written and beautifully filmed TV series the Wentworth Prison episode has the most nauseatingly, graphically violent and depraved scenes imaginable - seriously makes the worst scenes of Breaking Bad or the Sopranos look like kids movies.  Randall is a stupidly annoying villain who unfortunately appears to have an ongoing role in a highly repetitive storyline. We're really torn on whether to continue to season 2, too bad because we really loved the show up until it became a torture training film.",1465344000,4,565,5.01063829787234

If I had never read the books, I probably would have liked it more, the costumes are beautiful and the story is compelling. However, it is not true to the novels and that really bummed me out.  Jamie Fraser is supposed to be a giant, towering over everyone around him but in the show, he's almost the same height as Claire.  There are a lot of other smaller variations that made it more difficult for me to really engage in the show that probably wouldn't be an issue for someone who didn't really get into the books, but it kind of ruined the story for me.",1465257600,,657,4.190476190476191

7096770,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I absolutely loved all 8 or 9 volumes of this series -  both as a read and as audible.  If find the story inventive, riveting, full of surprises and subplot sprouting.  A vast cast of characters, most of whom are sufficiently defined so that we can relate to them.  I do' usually like historic fiction, or sic fi, but this series made a convert of me.  The writer is knowledgeable in many fields,  English and Scottish history,  the early days of the American colonies and the war of Independence,  herbology,  medicine,  etc etc.  The characters are real people, grown ups, who address human and ethical problems in an in depth fashion.  The stories are written in a vivid, colorful fashion, the French Court is brought to life as well as a Southern Slave plantation, as well as practically endless scenarios through which the action rolls.  Not to forget the centerpiece of the whole story, an incredible, passionate, enduring love affair and the creation of a life long partnership among equals.
I love the spoken version, the reader's accents, inflections and dramatic enactment of the many plots of this world I like to visit even after I finished reading it through at least twice.

7096824,5,B00VMIWA3O,"The superior video production of the Outlander saga is continued in this DVD which covers the second slice of the story based on Book 1 of the novels.  There are currently 8 remarkable novels of the mainstream story in print, so this video series may have very strong opportunities for some time to come. What makes Outlander video production so unique is the manner in which the story, which originated in large novels, has been written for the screen with great fidelity (to the books) and maybe a little degree of reverence for those remarkable works of historical fiction.  Of course the video story is compressed to fit into a reasonable of episodes by that masterful screen writing.

The DVD is delightful to watch, beautifully photographed, and wonderfully acted.  Casting is being done by wizards I think.",1464739200,,813,4.912408759124087

7096902,3,B00VMIWA3O,"Hmmm.. Season 102 is a far cry from Season 101. I always hate when characters do completely unbelievable things; or they do things that are either so good or evil that their actions put them outside human capability; or they do things that are so stupid that you end up shouting at the television and smacking your head. It's so distracting. I don't know if these events are original flaws from the author of the books or are creations from the screen writers, so I don't know whom to blame. Examples: in the first episode of Season 102, after Jamie rescues Claire from Black Jack Randall, why didn't he kill the scum right there and then? Any normal person would have done so. Up to this point, everyone can see that Black Jack is no common thug- he is truly and monstrously evil- he is insanely and obsessively evil and will not stop until he has ruined the couple. So... why leave him there on the floor? Another example: why didn't they make sure Black Jack was dead after they rescued Jamie from the prison after the cattle ran over him? Why would you 'assume' the guy was dead? After such a horror, it's just unbelievable that they wouldn't kill him. Another example: The silliness of dressing up like a man and singing the silly tune. Let's face it. The best plan would have been togo home. If Jamie wanted to find Claire, he would have gone home to find her- no need for the complexity of their scheme. I spent the whole episode flabbergasted! And now, to agree with most people, I must comment on the male rape scene. Look, as a survivor of rape myself, I am all for exposing the seriousness of the crime, but these scenes were gratuitous. They were more about twisted voyeurism than seeking to understand. They were more graphic and sick than needed to be. No rape is like what happened in these scenes. This wasn't just rape. This was monstrous torture and a full emotional and psychological teardown of a human being that took place where physical rape was only one of many tools used to achieve a complete breakdown of Jamie's character, spirit and even his sense of self. Again, I'm not sure if the books intended to create such a Super Villain as Randall as the series does, but in my opinion, it distracts from the show. It's almost as if the writers are short of good story telling and are using sheer horror to 'entertain' instead. A note for the 'TV-MA' rating. Let's face it, folks: it is worse than the movie's 'X' rated has ever been. It is a free for all S & M Porn designation. You can't have your kids anywhere near you when you watch any series with this designation. That's too bad, in my opinion, because these types of shows would be far better with a PG-13 or even an R rating.  TV MA has become almost a free for all soft porn rating.  The best scene:  when Jamie tells Claire about his fears and terrors and Claire fights her way back to him after the rape.  I was in tears the whole time.",1464220800,2,2921,4.4037037037037035
7096903,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I am in love with this series. I admire the strength of Claire and Jamie is the ultimate man. This is really a chick series as it moves rather slow.

7096909,4,B00VMIWA3O,"My fellow low-raters around here seem to be offended exclusively by graphic sex/rape scenes in the last 2 episodes. This view is valid, but primitive. The two stars were slowly developing a very deep story, and future, with sometimes brilliant acting, palpable screen chemistry and connection to the story they were hired to tell. The exterior scenes and period interiors are at times wonderful, always believable.

In these last episodes the writers put poor Claire on ""stage"" as an itinerant performer attempting to lure, or send a signal, via word-of-mouth, to her husband, putatively hiding out rom the English, somewhere in the surrounding countryside .In an effort to unearth some drama, some suspense, and generate contrived ""karma"", the writers succumbed to using--inserting into the script-- ""deus ex machina"", a crude and soulless device used to ""fix"" an uncooperative plot of which the writers lost creative control. God is pulling the strings, and what does that make the characters? Yah, puppets. But I like the series enuf to forgive any amateurish mistakes.

Some say a story is only as good as its villain. I kind of agree. And Randall is an excellent villain, behaving, however despicably, within certain believable bounds, committing believable atrocities (if that is possible)--until the last episode, until the writers, seeking to repair the faltering plot, attempt to explain what is not believable in their plot by dumping their troubles in Randall's lap, as it were. It's Randall's job now, or rather, the job of his perversions and evil proclivities--the source of his ""motivation""-- to drive the plot forward (and into future seasons). Randall then, despite Tobias Menzie's great acting, becomes the emissary for weak writing of deus ex machina. The best writing is usually ""character-driven"" writing, when every action and event, emanates from the various characters ""souls"", and seems inevitable, unquestionable. and, thus satisfying. Here, in these last episodes, as I mentioned, these great actors/characters, have been turned into puppets to fulfill the writers' gerry-rigged agendas. Still, having sayed all that ... I like it.",1464134400,2,2158,5.381656804733728

Horrible, stomach turning, sick male rape in far too graphic detail for far too long.  We agree with another reviewer, you have to be a sick sadist to watch this and I can't imagine actors going along with this or any one claiming this has anything to due with creative license.

If you're into the total emasculation of your favorite strong male character and pedophilia, stay tuned....otherwise quit at Season 102, episode 7 and imagine your own ending.

Just spiritually demoralizing....

We agree with this reviewer completely and couldn't say it better:

The first season was so great, the second really went south. The first few episodes were slow and too ""you're so hot this"" and ""I love you so much that."" It seemed like the actors were winging it and getting bored themselves. Then the fun really begins. Anyone who can stomach the rape scenes in the last few episodes is a sick sadist. Sorry, it has to be said. There's story telling and then there's pandering to a small sick part of humanity. Playing rape scenes over and over and over for no reason other than to get sick people off is degrading to all of us. This was nothing like the book. Yuck!",1464048000,6,1260,4.678733031674208

The countryside showing as Scotland is beyond beautiful!

7096952,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I never been so wrapped up on a show that was originated from a book ( which I never read)......but in all honesty, I had hoped the show was an original screen play but sadly, like most shows and movies worth watching, its from the mind of someone who actually think out a plot and story line with a reader in mind, not on how much money they can make from a supposed franchise. I usually don't read or watch stories with time traveling involved because if you there are so many paths as well as outcomes to explore. such stories can go on forever .....
This show's storyline has a steady pace that easy to keep track and some twist and turns that are not for the faint of heart. You will be surprised and amazed, plus shocked beyond words. In this half of the season, we start to hear and see things from Jamie's POV, which combines both story views of Claire. The depths of mind games played by Captain Randall, just blew my mind.... if Claire ever returns to her own time I doubt she would ever look at her Frank Randall the same again.

I actually can't stop watching. This is probably my third time. In between I have all 8 books from Audible plus the companions 1 & 11-AND I continue to listen to them again and again.

I've not read the books... but the graphic nature of what Jamie went through at the hands of Jack Randall was traumatizing and I feel could have been portrayed in a less graphic way.

7097168,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Although this book series has been around for 20 plus years, I never read any of the books until last year. I loved the books and now really love the series. It's rare that a book transitions well to a film/television show, but the cast of ""Outlander"" are such amazing actors that they breathe life into the books. So much so that when you read them, you only picture the actors who play them (at least for me). The first part of Season One was the foundation and establishing of who's who. The highlight being the ""Wedding"" episode and they lived happily ever after...hum, but they have an enemy who's name is Black Jack Randall. That being said;  the second half of Season One is far darker. It culminates in the episodes ""Wentworth Prison"" and ""To Ransom a Man's Soul"". They are shockingly raw and violent but also incredibly poignant. The love between Claire and Jamie Fraser is strong and rare. We see them off to a new adventure trying to stop Bonnie Prince Charlie in France so that the Battle of Culloden won't happen. These DVDs are a must for any fan of the books. Great drama.",1462924800,4,1087,4.48989898989899

7097173,3,B00VMIWA3O,got interested in the first few episodes....but this show is a bit too focused on rape for my taste.  I understand that was part of the times but that seems a major plot point for the majority of episodes,1462924800,,204,4.230769230769231

7097176,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Volume 2 is a worthy conclusion to Volume 1 which finishes the initial story line in Scotland. The Wentworth Prison episode goes further than I would have chosen to show the depravity of the Captain, but I have no doubt that there are people that sadistic out and about in the world.
As a  small aside, I found the numbering system chosen for the episodes to be confusing. Having both volumes and series to contend with seems overly complicated.",1462924800,,445,4.632911392405063

Despite the time travel element, the book was more historical romantic fiction and a surprisingly good example given the author's claim it was only a trial attempt.  The history was reasonably accurate and the romance was very involving.  The TV show has to condense a lot of the book and has unfortunately lost much of the depth and simplified much of the conflict in an attempt to clarify the narrative.  The character of Jamie was a little bland but he grew with the final episodes.  Claire is a bit too headstrong and shrewish compared to how she came across on the page.  The acting in general is very good.",1461801600,,670,4.541666666666667

7097549,5,B00VMIWA3O,"The producers of this film adaptation have captured the soul of Dianna's book superbly.  The harshness and perverse cruelty of the period was difficult to read and witnessing it in vivid color was by no means easier; however, it underscores the message of the story:  that of the uncompromising love between Jamie and Claire.  There is biblical truth in their relationship where marriage asks the participants to commit to each other, body & soul, to protect and defend each other at the expense of one's own life.  Short of mentioning the entire cast by name I would add that the  complement of actors was well chosen.  From the two protagonists and the clans to the English redcoats, all inhabited their roles as if they were born to play them.  Each portrayal is honest and compelling.  I can't imagine the overall expense to bring these pages to life but I can only say, as a huge fan of the Outlander series, that it was well worth it.  Magnificent !  Well done, all !

However, the characterization of the Lallybroch episode differs quite a bit from the book, and was very disappointing. It was one of my favorite book chapters, but this episode was entirely too confrontational. Also, the characterization of Jamie was very different than in the books. I hate it when dramatizations mischaracterize a beloved character. I don't know why they chose to paint him as an irresponsible bumbling character. Not cool.",1461283200,,520,5.058139534883721

7097590,1,B00VMIWA3O,"I am not familiar with the Outlander books, but saw so many promotional pieces and interviews, and read so many positive reviews that I was very interested to see it.  I watched the first 2 episodes then many weeks later 2 more, and binge watched 6 on and off in one day.  The filming and location were beautiful, almost dreamlike.  The music mesmerizing and the costumes extremely detailed and intricate.  Definitely, a carefully thought out production to the minutest detail.  The actors peformed exceptionally in the dramatic scenes, conveying the strongest emotions and excitement.  But even with all these attributes, I cannot justify watching it, and will not go any further in the series.  Art is intertwined in life, but there are boundaries when it no longer resembles art, but becomes dark and gratuitous.  When writers and directors graphically depict the most heinous crimes and sexual details, proclaiming it necessary for the story, they are really feeding their desires to be outrageous and contretemps.  They have tremendous talent, but reduce it to rubbish, using profanity, vulgarity, and torture in their scripts, painstakingly convincing themselves that it is art.  I am sorry for them, for the actors, and for the fans who have bought into this deception.  The professed success of a book or tv series, measured by the writers, producers, directors, actors, and fans involved is a biased opinion.  The Outlander tv series had all the elements to be amazing, but added in so much disturbing, irreverent, graphic material, it destroyed itself.  There is more than enough violence and sexual dysfunction in the world, now and throughout history.  Presenting it as artistic form does not change the reality of what it is.  It always must be rejected in reality and fiction, and overcome with virtue and industry, in real life and art.",1461196800,10,1851,5.082781456953643

7097594,5,B00VMIWA3O,This series has been my favorite of the season. I've enjoyed the historic perspective and the taking of modern skills (nurse becomes healer) back in time. The Scottish countryside is spectacular and the series is a sweeping story of romance amidst violence and political machinations. The large cast of characters is exceedingly well-drawn and well-played by the actors who inhabit them. Each episode leaves us wanting to know what comes next.,1461196800,,443,5.253521126760563

It includes amazing scenery and in-depth characters, but the truly remarkable part of this show, based on the book series, is the way that  it looks at power dynamics between a man and a woman who love each other fiercely, almost violently, but who love their independent identities just as much.  Diana Gabaldon has created the perfect man.  The sexuality is so raw and intimate that I can truly say I have never seen such tenderness and honesty on screen.  The costumes are authentic, the music superb. This is fine art and will keep you thinking and watching way beyond your first viewing.",1461110400,,692,4.504

7097684,5,B00VMIWA3O,Wonderful series...I have read all the books( downloaded on my kindle for repeat reading)  and was not disappointed. They did a great job depicting the scenes with Jack Randle...horrifying and acted out with realistic terror...If you loved the books this series will not disappoint.

7097688,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I certainly hope that STARS continues to offer the Outlander programming.

7097689,3,B00VMIWA3O,The prolonged sadistic scenes was over the top in my estimation. You don't need to swim in a cesspool to know what sewage is. I would have given it a 5 star If not for the lengthy sadistic rape scenes in the dungeon between Jamie and BJ Randle.  But that's why they have fast forward on the remote. And you will need it! Unfortunately some scenes were bordering on porno.,1461024000,15,371,4.3

7097694,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This is the very BEST series that I have ever read, and at 73 years, I have read a lot of novels.  Now that it is in video on the Starz network, it has come to life for me.  Diana Gabaldon is a terrific author with her research on Scotland and life back in the 1700's.  When the storyline goes into the Revolutionary War in the early Americas, the idea of the life and times give you a realistic view of our history.  I have read each book in the series via Audiobooks,com and the narrator, Davina Porter, is fantastic with the voices and accents of each character.  Now we have faces with the video and it just gets better.  This is an adventure you do not want to miss.",1461024000,,671,4.123076923076923

7097703,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Outlander is based on the premise of love through the ages, but thrives on characters whose lives delve into the principles of power, honor, integrity, and loyalty. Outlander presents the perversions of political upheaval and the realities of oppression and impending war as the bones on which human character can be built. The time travel aspect brings enough of occult mysticism and romantic imaging to bolster the enduring aspect of love, regardless of setting. Thoroughly engaging and obsessively powerful series.",1461024000,,517,5.475

I had read that this was a racy sexy chemistry filled show. I love ""Reign"" and ""The Tudors"" , ""The Other Bolyan Girl"" so though t I would love this as much as all the reviewers did.

The last two episodes of volume two contain the most graphic, explicit scenes of extremely bloody, violent, torture and homosexual rape that I have ever seen in a movie. Worse, in about 1 and 1/2 hours of film, there are about 45 minutes of the most disturbing, gross scenes imaginable. We had to fast-forward through most of it and, I'm not making this up, when the program finished, we had to watch ten minutes of kitten and puppy dog videos on YouTube in order to get the gross images our of our heads and get to sleep. Seriously, I've seen many, many violent films over the last fifty years, but this one takes the prize for the most disturbing and explicit scenes of body slashings and rape. YUCH! YUCH!

I'm sure some people may think, wow that means the actors did a great job acting so I must watch it. Sadly that is not the issue. There are somethings in life that you can't take back after you've seen it because those images and feelings live in your mind forever. So please do yourself a favor and run like the dickens from this utterly disgusting vulgar series. Don't get fooled by the cover and the initial episodes as I was.

Not the rape scene is in the book but it is not the focus of an entire chapter.  Although it does have echos throughout the rest of the book series.

7097923,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This adaptation is nothing short of breathtaking and magical. It is said that the mark of excellence in acting is the performer's gift of reaching into the emotional body of your audience and compelling whatever emotional response residing there to spill over into the awareness of the viewer, leaving an impression that isn't easily put away or ignored. Every actor playing each major character accomplishes this repeatedly. Extra Kudos to Tobias Menzies for his brilliant versatility in playing dual roles of Frank Randall and Captain Black Jack Randall. Always a special challenge and well played sir!!  If you have not read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series you will still enjoy this remarkable Television series. Having read the books, I am impressed with the respect Mr. Moore and his team of cast and crew displayed in every detail of this production. To top it off the level of historical accuracy is impressive as well. If you have not read the books, you are depriving yourself of a rare treat! Some people are intimidated by their volume. I have them on my Kindle so they are easy to read. My only question, which I can't seem to get a straight answer for, is this: When I order this DVD from Amazon how do I know if I am getting the format that I can view here in the states? I have read complaints from folks who have anxiously awaited the arrival of their Outlander DVD only to discover it was in PAL format and therefore not compatible with their device.

Although I'm not usually crazy about sex scenes, as so often they're just put into the movie to attract viewers. However, in this series they've been cleverly included into the whole story, making the characters and their relationships believable.
There's also some brutality, which I find hard to watch, but I just look away and my husband mutes the TV while those are on :). Again, they're not just there for effect - they're part of the story.

There are a few parts that are missing, or not in the right setting, but those aren't too vital ... except it bothered me that they smashed the wrong hand.

7098009,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This video follows the book of the same name and accidental time-traveling Claire, who fell through a circle of stones during All Hallows Eve and into 17th Century Scotland, and into the dispute between the ruling English and the lan-owning Scottish clans. Both worry that she is spying for the other, but the clans want to keep her for her benefit as a healer (she is a nurse) and the English want to torture the truth out of her. In order to keep the from delivering her to the English, she must become a Scott by marrying one. Though against marrying, she agrees this is the best course of action, and she marries Jamie Frazier, whom she likes, but comes to love. Capt. John Randall, aka Black Jack Randall for his evil black heart and tortuorous behavior, is the English soldier after Claire, and, it seems, also after Jaime. He has charged Jaime for murder which he himself had committed. Jaime had previously been jailed and Randall had whipped him with 200 lashes, leaving horrendous scars on his back. Randall is obsessed with Jaime, having a hidden sexual desire for him.

The book continues with evading capture, getting caught, and escaping -- that would be both Claire and Jaime in turn. There is lots of sexual scenes -- both good and bad. There is lots of adventure as they carr y out escape plans.

It is a long book.  Two seasons did not get through the book. I am not sure three will. Maybe four. It doesn't matter, though, because you will enjoy it. There are enough books for this to go on for a long while.",1457740800,4,1526,4.501805054151625

I would strongly recommend reading the entire Outlander series of books before you view Season One because it enables you to gain a deeper understanding of each of the characters lives and the time period they exist in.  Volume two under Season One was  intense because it developed the humanity of the main characters and proved that ""Clare"" and Jamie were deeply devoted and in love with each other.  The historical realism through film compleats our writers descriptions.  I have watched these episodes on my Kindle several times!",1457568000,,631,4.915094339622642

You don't get to see that book-to-screen translation come off quite so well, very often!  I also feel the casting of the characters in the books, whom I had grown to love (or hate, as the case may be), is another success.

7098115,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I never write reviews ever. I think if you are going out of your way to write something you only have something negative to say. But my god this is the most positive review ever. I LOVE this show. I read a million good and bad reviews. Debating this show a million ways because I read reviews. Well here goes mine:

I know nothing of Scottish history nor do I know that much of early English history. But however I was able to follow very well the issue at hand. I actually found myself wanting to know more about the full history.

The chemistry between Jamie and Claire is equal to Jack and Kate from Lost or Bill and Sookie from True Blood. It's passionate and pulls you into their lives. The dynamic between the two makes you keep watching. The sex scenes are well done and amazing. But the pure pull between the two makes you continue the show. It's almost a ying and yang that continue to push each to make themselves better. It has made want to read the books immediately.

Please give this one a try. It's an adventure the whole way through. It's a romantic Game of Thrones but, dare I say , better.",1456358400,,1107,4.287081339712919

7098231,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This is a story that is very insighful into the Scottish culture as well as the Druids
influence in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, England and France.  It was very realistic
in terms of the base attitudes of the local villagers as well as the vulgar but
realistic soldiers that were clan warriors and fighters. The stubborn yet righteous
attitudes that enabled victory and the role that women played in terms of blame
for just being women. Women wrongly accused, childbirth without help, dungeons
filth and standing for a noble cause. In the end it is a story of romance that love
conquers all and helps one survive the impossible.",1454457600,,626,4.796296296296297
7098232,2,B00VMIWA3O,"I wanted to see what all the buzz was about, so I did the Starz trial.  I wasn't thrilled with the language and porn, but I kept watching volume one because it was addicting.  I bought the DVD for volume two and planned to resell it when I was finished.  Got to the last episode and tried to skip forward as much as possible because of the disturbing scenes -and violence doesn't bother me too much. Just when you think it was safe, they keep repeating the disturbing male to male rape scene.  Volume one, male to female rape scene was mild compared to this.  It was like the director visually kept pushing your face in a pile s*** and when you come up for air, he pushes your face back down in it-over and over again.
What troubles me is that this doesn't seem to bother most people who review this-since it got mostly five stars. I guess people don't mind having their face pushed in a pile of s***-they don't think it stinks-it's art after all.  Directors keep pushing the envelope to get shock value-I think we have come to the point where nothing shocks us anymore- just entertains.  I threw my DVD in the trash.",1454457600,6,1117,4.341346153846154

7098256,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Volume Two continues the story of Claire and Jamie.  The characters around them as well are more developed.  The actors are continually challenged by their expanding roles which they rise to very well.  One also continues to learn more about the history of 18th century Scotland.  Men could learn a lot about being a sensitive, thoughtful partner.  Women could learn just how much they influence the pace of the sexual relationship.  I am a HUGE fan.  Can't wait for Season Two!",1454198400,,478,4.827160493827161
7098257,1,B00VMIWA3O,"The first season was beautiful.  The sinister and gruesome was gently woven and softened if you will by the absolute majesty of Scotland, the gorgeous clothing and of course the physical attractiveness of the characters.  We couldn't wait for season 2.  A friend of ours pirated it and offered it to us but we said no, we will wait and pay full price.  Popcorn in hand we dove into the second season and with each episode became more disappointed with the story line.  The final 2 successfully finished me off.  I understand that terrible and disgusting things happen but there is value in leaving something to the imagination.  I feel like I had a front row seat to the perverted stealing of a man's very soul which is far more disturbing than a lashing on the back, no matter how thorough.  ""Sing me a song of a lass that is gone, could this lass be I?""  Indeed it is!  This bonnie lass will not recommend this series again nor purchase any other that are released.",1454198400,10,967,4.474285714285714

7098265,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This is one of the best series on Starz and TV.  The story is a wonderful tale anyway and the books have been best sellers for several decades.  It is about time a creative director, producers, crew and cast tackled this story.  The locations and costuming are stunning, but what makes this work is the absolute believability of the actors.  Starz has assembled committed, innovative people and it shows in the superiority of the craftsmanship. It is the finest/fiercest acting I have experienced in many a year and that is saying something considering the excellence of many contemporary performers and crews.  The relationships are seemingly so real that I have felt like I need to tiptoe out of the room and give them their privacy.  I was very sorry the Emmy's did not acknowledge awarding winning brave performances and directors.  Bravo Starz.",1454025600,3,849,4.936619718309859

7098280,2,B00VMIWA3O,"dark and last two episodes too graphic to watch, so I did not.  It is a good series, great acting, beautiful scenery and music, but way too much graphic sex that is unnecessary. Story would have been just as engaging if they had left more of the love scenes to your imagination.  It is not necessary to show it all.  Had read an online review of volume 2 so did not watch the last two episodes due to the graphic and disturbing nature of the content, which apparently goes on and on for over an hour.  Do not see why the writers and producers felt like they had to destroy what was a good solid series(although with too much graphic sex) with you investing in the characters, and then destroy it with absolute horror of torture and rape.  Just reading the review of the last two episodes was enough for me.  Disappointing to invest the time and interest in a series and have it end in such a crude manor.

It is rare that the video story can be as good as the book but in the case of Outlander I have been thoroughly satisfied. The director has followed the story line accurately and beautifully. The acting is superb the cinematography is spectacular and of course the story is fabulous. It provides an historically accurate picture of a very tumultuous time in Scottish history with a little fantasy time travel injected although it is so well done you begin to believe it might actually be possible!

Afraid the TV shows would be overly girlie, but not the case. Strangely, the movies capture almost perfectly the same ambiance as the books, and the same balance of story that is manageable for me.

This volume (2) was heavy with violence and sex. I would have preferred much less of the graphic scenes between Jamie and Claire; as well as the prison rape that lasted for what seemed like forever.
The writers seemed to have lost sight of the 'modern' world and the plight of her (first) husband and how her lack of presence affects her family and that  time period. It would make the story line so much more interesting and intriguing.",1453507200,2,501,4.5054945054945055

7098377,1,B00VMIWA3O,"I agree with all the other ""One-star"" folks about Vol-2.  It was such a wonderful storyline and SUDDENLY, spanning the better part of two episodes, we're treated to a FULL hour and a half of senseless human torture....male/male rape, bondage, branding irons, beatings, smashing limbs with hammers, nailing a hand to a table, and all this gratuitous and graphic cruelty..... went on and on and on and on and on.  Good grief, where did the plot go?  I finally bailed out and hit EJECT.  It was as if the screenwriters completely ran out of ideas on how to squeeze out two more episodes and round out the season.  Having read the books and knowing first hand the wealth of plots and wonderful stories, it really rams home the pointlessness of this pathetic ""filler"" by these hack screen ""re-writers"".  Count me out of any further purchases or viewings if this is the direction it's headed.  Have they absolutely no sense of shame in their entire bodies?",1452988800,6,950,4.721212121212122

The time travel bit attracted me to the story, and in the 16 episodes we watched, it is barely an afterthought.  You spend hours showing off the monster character (Black Jack) you created, and let him wreak havoc on everyone, then all of a sudden he appears to be die in one second, with no real justice dealt.  Gee, what a shame he wasn't allowed to triumph to the end.  Someone obviously thought he was such an important character.  I don't spend time with garbage, and that's what that character was.

This was too much for me. The way the audio lingered on the sounds of the throttling of the hanged men, the way the camera lingered on Fraser's torture and wounds, the way the script stretched the torture scenes with Randall, are all completely unacceptable for viewing by anyone under 17. And pretty much anyone. I now understand why French ladies of the evening call flogging le vice Anglais.

The show is well rounded and adds a lot of adventure which keeps me interested. Catriona is not at all how I imagined Claire, but I still somehow like her in the role. Sam Huegan looks nothing like Jaime before the costuming hair and makeup, but with his acting and the amazing team on the show, you'd never know that. He just becomes Jaime somehow.

7098429,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I agree with ""Missyhope's"" review. I love Outlander but season two episode 7 and 8 with Randall raping, beating, and torturing Jamie was too much. Plus, the witch trial. Season two was as if Diana Gabaldon was on LSD and this was her nightmare. I'm not sure why Diana felt the need to write such a dark and sadistic rape experience for Jamie and how does it tie in with with the overall story of Jamie and Claire? I don't know why an author would write something as perverted as that in a perfectly good love story. Very disappointing Diana Gabaldon and sick. I hope Diana got the darkness out of her system and Season Three is more like Season One. The full frontal nudity of actor Tobias Menzies as Jack Randall (including fondling himself)? I don't want to see things like that. Good grief, leave something to the imagination.",1451347200,2,829,4.533333333333333

I enjoyed the characters and the rendering of the beauty and harshness of the landscape.

7098457,1,B00VMIWA3O,"If you could cut out the story of the people from the future going back in time to the past of the Highlanders vs English then it might actually be an awesome story. At first I was upset that they had any bit of a story of the husband missing his wife because it is impossible in the timeline for him to expend any time missing her if she returns. However I suspended science and continued on with the story. Then I noticed terms which kept being used and words which Highlanders of the period would never know or understand but yet the time traveler would use them and the Highlanders would instantly understand the meaning. Yes, there were some moments where they were confused but other times it seemed to slip past. I originally said that she must be a carrier of some sickness but then my wife argued it is possible she carries no disease so I conceded this point. So with that being said, while a very interesting story I must dismiss it. I have wasted too much time hoping that it would turn out for the better. However I will say I did enjoy the politics of the period and the Highlander life has always interested me. 1/5 because it is filled with flaws galore.",1450483200,3,1170,4.34703196347032

7098465,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Outlander, is so well done! The characters are developed so well, I found myself rooting for my favorites! I despised the lead antagonist. The hardships that one man endures at the hands of another, for love is unbearable. I could feel the anguish and self loathing created by one mans reprehensible actions to tear apart his nemisis (our hero) until he was a shell of his former self. A truly  broken sole unable to trust his feelings.
 This show is a must see. Be aware there are some hard core seen of rape ect,  so for the most part don't watch it with your children. The graphic segments are needed, in fact, to share with the viewer how cruel and inhumane  one person  can be to another. Even though the show is considered science fiction, you don't need to be a fan of science fiction to enjoy this well done drama of a women torn by her love for two men.",1450310400,,862,4.329192546583851

The casting of Sam Heughan as James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser has not been disappointing. I had been worried that they would not find a perfect Jamie. Sam and all the cast as well as the crew have exceeded my expectations.

7098483,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This series is a historical fiction story that covers almost every film-making genre there is, including epic history (of 18th century Scotland),  the military occupation and fighting between the Scots and the English,  romance (which shows lovemaking from a woman's view),  fantasy and adventure (Claire's time travel),  horror (the last 2 episodes depict a sadistic rape and torture in a prison), and there is even a little comedy duo (Angus and Rupert).  It was beautifully filmed in Scotland and the music, costumes, castles, kilts, and weaponry give it a realistic feel.  The actors at times speak in the authentic Gaelic language (Ye ken? means ""You know?""), and with a strong Scottish burr when they speak in English so be prepared to not understand a lot of what they are saying.  Unless you're from Scotland, of course.  Most of the story is told from Claire's 1945 English point-of-view.  Some of the episodes have very explicit nudity and violence, so be forewarned if you're sensitive to that sort of thing - this is not a show for children.  I felt that the sex scenes were tastefully done, but last 2 episodes (15 and 16) were a bit overly gruesome.  The showrunners seemed to be trying to show real life in the 1700s, but some things could have been left to the imagination.

The director has admitted in interviews that he and his wife enjoyed the series and it shows in the production of this Star's series.  I am also impressed that they used the author of the book series as an advisor, I think that makes a world of difference to the accuracy of the show.  They are very true to the books, with a few variations of course but very few.  Watch you will love it, especially if you have read the books.

It seemed like the actors were winging it and getting board themselves. Then the fun really begins. Anyone who can stomach the rape scenes in the last few episodes is a sick sadist. Sorry, it has to be said. There's story telling and then there's pandering to a small sick part of humanity. Playing rape scenes over and over and over for no reason other than to get sick people off is degrading to all of us. This was nothing like the book. Yuck!",1449100800,36,600,4.271929824561403

7098561,5,B00VMIWA3O,"We often think that the screen version of a book cannot be as nuanced and detailed as the written version. The screen versions of both Outlander Volume One or Volume Two add a lot..  The changes to make the first book of the ""Outlander"" historic series  more visual for the screen make Diana Gabaldon's excellent content and dialogue even more vibrant.  I'll lay out some of the vibrancy while trying not to make the descriptions spoilers for those who have not see the DVD's.

In Volume Two's episode the ""Reckoning,"" Jamie Fraser uses a dirk to swear allegiance to Claire with some of the words used in the DVD Volume One's "" The Gathering"" when most of the MacKenzie clan swear allegiance to Colum MacKenzie.  In the screen version the use of a dirk by both Jamie and Claire is riveting while also much being more powerful and more sexual.  In the book version it's more incidental and symbolic though with a similar intent.  Quite wonderful that the author is a constant consultant to the screen version.  The additional explanations from the director are part of these very well done DVD's.  The additional director interviews are not to be missed.

In Volume Two's episode ""The Search, ""  Claire and Murtagh want to let Jamie know that they're looking for him so he contacts them.  The screen version uses a famous Andrews Sisters tune of World War II where she had served as a combat nurse. Again much more powerful than the search in the novel with other appropriate changes.

Having read and reread the book, the screen version is in some ways can be even more spell binding. Lest I ignore the tumultuous ending episode ""To Save a Man's Soul,"" it tends to portray Claire's use of witchcraft in a more cursory manner on screen than the historical novel.  The last witchcraft trial was of a Scottish medium in 1944 so still recent for Claire.

Have not found anything anachronistic in the novel.  It's an accurate view of the era and the locations.  Just fascinating to check with the ""Outlandish Companion"" to check the characters, the place names and the Gaelic expressions.  The books and the DVD's all support each other!",1449014400,,2132,4.7008086253369274

7098622,5,B00VMIWA3O,"The actors give amazing performances throughout. Except for the hand smashing, it's not as graphic as I'd feared from some of the reviews. I think the rape scenes seem more explicit because of the pain, shame, and pleasure expressed on the faces, where the camera mostly dwells--Sam Heughan deserves a Best Actor award, with Tobias Menzies right behind him (no pun intended). The women are also outstanding. This is an excellent series but the stark depiction of the time period may put some viewers off. I'm looking forward to another season.",1448323200,,543,4.978021978021978

7098628,5,B00VMIWA3O,If you loved the first one you will enjoy this one as well. The scenery and costumes are wonderful. They changed several aspects of the plot compared to the books. They left out a few characters and added others. I have read a few reviews where people felt Jamie and Claire had no chemistry. I disagree. I thought the scene where she tells him she may never be able to have children was very touching. When he looks at her you can see the love in his eyes. Great acting by Sam H.,1448236800,,479,4.161290322580645

Great movie for couples not teens or kids due to the obvious reasons but my husband and I seam to really enjoy it together. And that never happens cause he's not big on ""romance"" movies, but this did. So I keep buying them and still love them. They remind me a lot of Braveheart with Mel Gibson!

7098704,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I loved Season One, Vol One and give it 5 stars, however, Vol Two was disappointing for two reasons.  The ""just in the nick of time"" and ""down to the wire"" twists and unrealistic rescues are a turn-off for me. In real life Jamie would have been hanged. No way Claire would have found the keys to get into the dungeon in the short period of time that she had access to that chamber without being found out  I could go on-and-on. Two of the episodes were just a bit over-the-top. I also feel the sex scenes are unnecessarily explicit. It's very easy to get the point of what's going on without it going on-and-on. It is so graphic I find it to be just short of pornographic. I watched Vol. One twice; that will not be the case with Vol. Two.",1447891200,4,739,4.197183098591549

I love books/stories that have ""sequels"" to them.....even though this is just one ongoing story I think. It will be great reading for the winter months!

7098827,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I know this is a fantasy, but I enjoyed more ""realism"" in volume one.  Some of the story line has become very far fetched, like how many miles and countryside they cover on horseback, sometimes it takes days to get somewhere and yet they can quickly return somewhere in a matter of hours when the urgency strikes. They don't carry much with them, yet Claire can always produce a change of clothes or a string of pearls, or a sack of coins right out of her pocket when she needs to.
Still hooked, but not sure how much more acting challenge there remains for the actor playing Jamie. Wow that last episode was an actors pinnacle for him!",1447200000,,636,4.389830508474576

7098829,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This review of ""Outlander"" combines both volumes I and II.

The richness of story, pace and character development amid the inspiring Scottish landscape in this series is outstanding: the sense of time, conflict and place captivating.  I love the strength of Claire Randall/Fraser, her independent spirit, medicinal skill and her intuitiveness in surviving the extraordinary journey she is thrust into.  The brave, sympathetic and loyal Jamie Fraser is equally intuitive, and this trait seems to draw both characters together at the onset.  In fact, there is a lot of intuitiveness in this series, from both the director's end and in overall character portrayal, which I think gives a genuine feel of historical setting when one's absolute survival depended on the sharpness of one's wits.  I'm not a die-hard romantic fiction fan, but I've come to adore the growing devotion between the two main characters, Claire and Jamie.  It's almost difficult to recall the quietly brilliant Frank Randall wondering what could have possibly happened to his missing wife in the midst of her and Jamie's deepening love for one another in another era of time.

While the story, itself, holds some repetitiveness in the peril and rescue theme, it may just be a reflection of existence, which is a continuum of friction and survival, interspersed with moments of peace of mind and some joy.  It's easy to forget how raw life actually is (and certainly was, historically) when not cushioned by technological distractions and modern sensibilities.  I thought the whole ""burn the witch"" trial was a bit over the top, even for the residuals of a superstitious Scotland at the time.  Geillis was an interesting character who apparently turned from being a bit spooky to unsavory, yet I'm not convinced that burning both her and her baby alive at the stake was a necessary component to Claire's compelling choice at the stones.  I've ordered the whole set of Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series, and so perhaps in the written story there is a deeper response in Claire to the savagery of Geillis's end that was notably absent in the filmed adaptation.

The profound intensity of the final two episodes in this series season (vol. 2) is testament to some skilled and courageous acting.  Yes, the visual content is strong, disturbing in its ability to raise emotion, both in terrifying sympathy for the brutalized victim as it is pure loathing for the sadistic victimizer, but it is more than either of these. It is further testimony to the remarkable competence and intuitiveness of Claire's character as she fights to bring her 18th century husband back from the dark, internal despair of shame and degradation.  I think it is important to note that this series is interspersed with some heavy violence from the minute Claire finds herself in another century, so viewer beware. Film and literature may be the last bastion of expressing things not wished to be stared at long...like death and the sun, as has been said, somewhere.",1447113600,2,3001,5.036363636363636

7098835,4,B00VMIWA3O,"Not as good as volume one, but true to the book.  The sex and nudity in this half of the first season may be too much for some, but it does faithfully reflect the book.  What happens to Jamie is central to his character and that of Black Jack Randall.  The depiction is graphic, but in my opinion well done.  I think some find it too much because of the amount of time it consumes.  This is unfortunately one of the problems with adapting books to the screen.  I'm a fan and even though I had to pay for this series (I don't get Starz), I will buy and watch as long as it is on.",1447113600,,578,3.939655172413793

I do have to say I've enjoyed all of the books too, and am pleased to have the series follow so closely to them.

7098851,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This is a very mystical and magical series filled with scenes of the beautiful English/Scottish countryside and castles.  It makes me want to check out those castles and historic landmarks first hand!  There's a bit of magic thrown in with the life of a young nurse who's thrown back quite a few centuries in time and has to deal with the primitive lifestyle of that time period.

It is a historical fiction series centered around events that occurred in the lives of the Scottish Highlanders and their constant and bloody struggles with the King of England and the British soldiers. Of course it's also filled with loads of romantic and sometimes quite raunchy love scenes between the British nurse, Claire, and the ever present hero and brawny Scotsman, Jamey.  It's definately not a movie for the family or the ""faint of heart"" with all the X-rated love scenes and bloody battles.

If you have read the book, this movie follows it very closely.  I read the book in 2011 and couldn't put it down!  Great historical fiction.",1447027200,,1025,4.757062146892656

The whole show has been a very good adaptation of the first book. I know some people complain about their favorite parts not being in there or not being where they should be. For the most part, I haven't minded. The show does an excellent job with  what they can and often throws in some bits that aren't technically from the book(s) but work just fine in the context of the show.

It is kind of clever how they set up the box for part one to fit part two, and the two lenticular photos (one with each part) are well done and clever but it would have been, or would be nice, if they just had a two disk blu-ray. Not for me, but for my dad. I think he'd like the show but he's not one for the extra stuff. :-)",1447027200,,895,3.966666666666667

I really like where this season ended, and season two looks like it will be great. I have not read the books, so I can't comment on how well this follows them, but this show is amazing on its own.  This is definitely not a show for kids.  There is rampant sexual assault, so you may want to avoid this series if that's a trigger for you.",1446508800,,501,3.9207920792079207

7098973,5,B00VMIWA3O,The first half of the season was setting up so many parts of the story and introducing characters but Vol. 2 pulls out all the stops. I had to ease into the last two episodes because of the graphic nature of the trauma I knew was coming (psychological probably worse than physical). I can't say I enjoyed some of those scenes but marvel at the actors who made them seem all too real. All the actors are perfection from the leads to the smallest parts but I have to say that Sam Heughan (Jamie)  can say more with his eyes/face than pages of dialog. I had never read the Outlander books before so I had no expectations (though I am reading them now). This is one of the best TV productions I have ever seen and hope Season 2 will live up to the promise that this season delivered.,1446508800,,779,4.228187919463087

7098981,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Not for the faint of heart. Cruelty that was tolerated in past times, along with ignorance and superstition, led to an uneasy existence for many people.

When I heard about the TV series, I didn't believe they could possibly make the books into a movie or a TV series. The books are extremely detailed. I had to wait to see the DVD because I don't have Starz. After buying the first part of season one I ordered part two of season one.  Now I wait on the edge of my seat for season two.  Yes, I am very pleased with this DVD and I highly recommend its purchase.

In the book, I remember when Black Jack freed Claire from Prison, she had to fight wolves who were feasting on hanged Scots.  That was not in the film.",1446422400,12,333,4.338709677419355
7098994,1,B00VMIWA3O,"My husband and I enjoyed the first part of Season One, so we purchased Volume Two, hoping that it would continue with an interesting storyline, with the main characters having interesting adventures between their two worlds.

What we didn't expect was how this ended.  It was so disgusting, so graphic, SO inappropriate for what was supposed to be a love story, a bit of fantasy of time travel, not endless details of male rape and torture between Jamie and Randall.  How does any of this fit into the original story? Even if the writers and producers felt that the audience needed to be convinced that Randall was a sadistic bastard, they could have easily made that point in a lot less time.  This whole flashback to the crime of rape was dragged out unnecessarily, and that, in itself, is a crime.

I could not finish watching this horrible show, and I will not be ordering the next season.  If I could give this a zero rating, I would. Buyer beware!!!",1446422400,50,955,4.588235294117647

It's an interesting story and the acting is out of this world. The main character Claire, did a million things I thought were cringe worthy. I think I yelled ""are you kidding me???"" at the screen a dozen times. But the story kept me engaged and it was so well done, I had to continue to watch. I'd definitely recommend it to others who aren't afraid of stepping outside obvious plot lines, genres, and character arches.  Now apparently, I have to wait some interminable time for Starz to produce season 2 (or is it 3?) but I'll wait- it's just that good.",1446336000,,708,4.446153846153846

7099046,3,B00VMIWA3O,"He is NOT Jamie. He is pretty but does not have the fire in his belly nor the ability to carry off Jamie's wry sense of humor. He's too flat. He says he loves Claire but other than the  sex,you don't sense the connection that Claire and Jamie have in the book which is very intense. So, I am glad I read the entire series, all 8 books before I watched any of it. Jamie is supposed to be taller than everyone, people stare at him when he comes into town. They call him Big Red. Anyway. I think Claire is a better match.
I was also really disappointed in the lack of development in the characters of those close to Jamie, especially Murtagh. He just kind of appears as do all these other guys and you have no idea who they are or where they came from. I chocked it up to poor screen writing which exists throughout season 2 as well. So, I will live in my book world. I don't even know if I will watch season 3. They skipped so much. they had to because the books are so long.",1446249600,4,973,4.015463917525773

7099067,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This series is a must-see for romantics and history buffs alike. While the story an its main stars are cast in a time-traveling love story for the ages, it's not a ""chick-flick."" There is plenty for both men and women to enjoy. With the beautiful Scottish Highlands as a backdrop, it brings to life a time in history (18th century) where tensions between the Scots and Brits were reaching a fever pitch leading to the second Jacobite uprising. The series stays true to the popular book series by Diana Gabaldon. I hadn't heard of the books before I started watching the TV series, but the show so enchanted me, I've now read every morsel of her eight books. Ron Moore of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame produces the series and has proven a skilled story-teller. The casting is outstanding. The main Highlander character, Jamie, is a heart-throb (seriously!), but Sam Heughan (the actor who plays the role) also is an excellent actor deserving of top awards. Catriona Balfe as Claire embodies the role beautifully. It is her story of accidental time-travel that is the main story line. A warning for some - the series is graphic in places and shows open sex scenes. While it's largely a drama, there is plenty of humor to make it an enjoyable ride. One final note, I strongly recommend the blue-ray DVD as the extra scenes and special features are well worth it.",1446249600,4,1357,4.729957805907173

Moore and his amazingly accomplished team have captured the essence of her story. They have taken creative license (with the blessing of Ms. Gabaldon) in order to tell the story in a different format and have done so in a most effective way. There is enough difference that I was always watching to see how they would ""handle"" the material which is wonderfully dense in the books and often extremely emotionally challenging. The writing, the directing, the acting, the sets, the scenery and the cinematography are outstanding.",1446076800,,644,5.02803738317757

It's just not as memorable as I think it should be, and while part of the story is set in the 1940's, the Big Band Era soundtrack just seems odd, especially when it's played while Claire is in 1743 Scotland.

7099130,3,B00VMIWA3O,"What can I say... I fell in love with this series when I came across a free viewing for season one, volume one, episode one. Love with the story line, actors, scenery, customs, music, etc! Loved it all! Don't like the graphic whipping scenes, but they were kept at a minimum and the sex was in line with a first night as a husband and wife. Finally a story that's not all sex and violence! I immediatly ordered Volume Two when it was available. Upon viewing the first half the story was clearly adding more violence and more sex then the first volume. I had the fast forward on stand by. The last two episodes in this volume are sickening to watch. The actors acted great for what was being portrayed, but I don't find torture and rape entertaining. It goes on and on. There are some great scenes that would have easily conveyed what happen to this young man without every detail being showed. I did hit the fast forward because it was never ending. Starz went too far! I can't control or choose what comes out of the Hollywood, but I can choose what I view as a consumer. When torture and rape is considered entertainment then it's not about those who produced it, but about me who's choosing to view it. I won't be back for Season Two.",1445990400,5,1237,4.359307359307359

7099134,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This is a great season to watch on DVD.  I could not get into the books, but I have really enjoyed watching it on TV.",1445990400,,117,3.68
7099135,4,B00VMIWA3O,"For those who haven't read the book: the story is good and the acting is excellent. I could definitely do without all the sex, torture and violence although the acting in those parts were amazing - especially the acting skills of Sam Heughan, Catriona Balfe and Tobias Menzies. I cried in many scenes, I fast-forwarded on the hard to watch parts - I don't want those images in my head. There were some good character relationship build ups - between Claire and Gellis and between Claire and Murtaugh. I would have liked to see more character development between Claire and Jamie - what I enjoyed about the volume 1 set.

For those who love the books: I would give this volume between 2-3 stars. The reason is that there were so many tender and sweet moments in the book that was not shown in the movies that were essential to understanding the characters. NO, movie adaptations are never as good as the book but I really wished:
1. After the spanking scene, their were so many sweet moments when Jamie talked about his past and the fact that he always got belted for his behavior. I thought these were so essential to understanding the two main characters and to developing their new love for each other after their hasty marriage.
2. The Lallybroch episode was all wrong! Jamie was completely out of character is this episode. In the book, he comes home and becomes Laird without being a jerk, as shown in the episode. Claire learns the way of the family and starts to fit in by visiting the tenants and using her healing skills as well as developing a warm relationship with Jenny and her family. This was not developed in the episode. The book allows even more growth between Claire and Jamie - it makes us realize that they are growing more comfortable with each other and that they can live their lives as man and wife. I also disliked that Jamie had no pants on in the stone mill scene. In the book, he wears his father's flannel shorts when he dives in to fix the water wheel. That was a hilarious scene in the book and should have been repeated in the episode.
3. In the Search, Claire again uses her healing skills - it's probably more entertaining to show the variety show that they do but it's also not so believable. I like that the episode does build the relationship between Claire and Murtaugh.
4. The last 2 episodes were very difficult to watch. I wish that they adapted the book - the wolf scene was cut out entirely, the scene with MacRannoch after the rescue was completely altered (it was really good in the book). Finally, more time should have been spent on Jamie and Claire's recovery (yes, it was for both). Claire had lots of character growth with her interactions with the priest at the abbey. There should have been more exorcising of Jamie's demons - I thought that was glossed over. It doesn't necessary have to be shown in entirety but have more emphasis in dialogue or an excerpt version. I really lament that Jamie's recovery and Jamie/Claire relationship was not extended. In the book, the snow scene with Jamie going out the window and walking outside in his nightshirt showed his character and stubbornness coming back. Jamie and Claire also start renewing their love for one another in a different way - since both went through the rough violence that Jamie experienced. I thought the final scene in the book was very sweet and tender - especially in how Jamie knew that Claire was pregnant.

It's hard to watch something that may not have matched your imagination when reading the book. But overall, I thought the episodes were very well done. If you haven't read the books, you would enjoy the story (not so much the images). If you have read the book, there were some lapses in Jamie going out of character and some favorite scenes that were deleted or altered.",1445990400,,3801,4.580029368575624

Having read many of the reviews - on Amazon and on Facebook I was prepared for a certain degree of revulsion, but was impressed with the sensitivity of the production.  It was very difficult to remember that this was a film - the performers were outstanding.

If you are faint of heart, the final two episodes are beyond brutal - but they are necessary to fully understand the dynamics of the relationship between Jaime and Claire.  Most important of all, they leave the viewer knowing that Jaime and Claire have the most important thing - love and hope.",1445817600,,636,4.693693693693693

I have no problems with sex scenes and nudity but these kind of sadistic perverted  sex scenes
make me sick. This scenes drag out way to long.

Anyway- Long story short- LOVE the new series.  Claire was perfectly cast, took me a couple episodes to reconcile with the actors selected for Jaime and Frank/Jonathan Randall, but quickly realized both actors were perfect for their respective roles.  All of the other actors chosen for the roles really bring their characters to life.  Well Done.  THANK YOU for doing the story proud and creating the fascinating and harrowing world of 1700 Scotland, and for somehow making time travel seem reasonable plausible rather than ridiculous.",1445731200,,720,4.966666666666667

7099192,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Probably the best TV series I have ever watched. Absolutely addictive. I had to read all the books because I had to know what happened next. Couldn't love it more. Great for romance, great for action, great for history.",1445731200,,219,4.641025641025641
7099193,3,B00VMIWA3O,"The dvd collection is organized and it is nice they don't have a ton of trailers on the front. I wish it had fast play and the memory chip for pause and restart. I have no time to remember what episode I left off on. I would not recommend this for sensitive viewers. Lots of X rated scenes. It does follow the book sort of, but with extreme graphic violence and sex scenes this is not for the sensitive people. I find it highly odd that it is geared towards women and yet the style of video and editing is very manly oriented. Not much thought is given to unique transitions or beautiful lighting. It's very bare bones and tight budget for multiple shots. Editing is fine but it can drag in scenes. The hair and make up and costumes are spot on. I would hope that their future episodes don't waist time on recaps and showing multiple shared shots. They tend to reuse the same dramatic shot multiple times. It's better to have an implied thought or deeper meaning in an expression. Don't just show us exactly what the character went through.  I really can't stand recaps before each episode, I would cut those. They should put a skip chapter edit in the DVD so we can speed watch it. The chemistry between the characters is good. Jamie is charming and I can see that is why so many women watch it. But it could have been pushed further artistically. Acting wise great job to all the actors and they did a fabulous job with the limitations set on them.  Now, don't send me hate mail because I didn't love it. I said it was okay and men are more likely to enjoy it. It should be rated R or X for content and graphic shots. I am a little disappointed because I heard so many positive reviews and it seemed a let down. Story wise it is very well done. Lots of rising action and strong dialog. More time could be used for better dramatic compositions and perhaps some down time shots. A romantic film could use a better score of music.",1445731200,4,1929,4.2967032967032965

7099222,4,B00VMIWA3O,A well-acted suspenseful drama written in the context of 18th century history of Scotland. Includes significant amount of nudity and violence. The nudity is far more than would be allowed in a similar production in the states. Yet the series creates a large degree of anticipation for succeeding episodes through its excellent screenplay and strong roles played by lead actors. The overall quality of the production surpasses the majority of similar British dramatic series made over the past decade or so.,1445558400,,506,5.2592592592592595

7099227,5,B00VMIWA3O,"If you enjoyed the books... You will love the series.  It pretty much follows the story. The acting, scenery, and film production make for great entertainment. Although, I do not remember  the book being so umm.. graphic in the intimate parts of the story line... what I'm saying is that the sex scenes are close to being soft porn.  Not that I'm complaining... I was just surprised.  Maybe I've been watching too much Disney lately, and didn't realize that ""grown up"" tv had evolved so well.  Had I known, I would have given the kids an 8:00 bed time!  And I did tell my husband to feel free to take notes, in case inspiration hits.

There is one part of the series that I could not watch.. so I fast forwarded through that.  I do not want to say what it was, because I do not want to spoil the series.  But, since I read the book, and it disturbed me when I read it... I knew to hit the fast forward button on the remote.

No, seriously, this is not a show for young kids or even your teenagers... but I am loving the series... not only for the story line of a book I loved, but also because the script was well written and the filming, music, etc... are high quality.  It's a great series to watch with your hubbie snuggled in bed with the kids in another room fast asleep.",1445558400,4,1276,4.209876543209877

However, it does deviate at some points from the book and  intensity but suppose only an 1hour timeline is confining--each should be 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The actors have taken great effort with their characters.  It is too bad Murtagh didn't get more play, he is a pivotal supporting role.  It may be Claire's story but Jamie definitely steals the show.

7099281,4,B00VMIWA3O,"First I am glad I purchased the collectors edition. Now with both parts together it makes a great addition to my collection. I really enjoy to period settings and believe the acting is very good. The only take back was the movement between two different times in history did make me have to think back to early episodes. Probably was good for my brain, but it did take a little to keep everything in order because of the lapse in time between the first set and second. Now as to the story line. It tells a very good story about living in two different eras. One of the best things I liked was how a strong women born and raised in the early 20th century stood up for herself and others when sent back to a earlier time in Scotland during the time the Scots were trying to get their prince brought back to rule instead of being under English rule. It is well worth watching and I believe it will become a classic.",1445385600,6,912,4.247126436781609

7099299,2,B00VMIWA3O,"Truly enjoyed Season One - volume One, but the producers/film makers of Volume Two seemed to feel the need to incorporate as much nudity as possible into it.  I am not a prude or a religious fanatic and I've seen my share of pornography, but I found the focus on graphic bedroom scenes, rape scenes and a the repeated and very graphic homosexual rape scene(s) of Jamie Fraser (which was almost the entire focus of the last episode) totally unnecessary and actually ruined this entertaining story.  Why do film makers feel the need to do this?  The movie would have been much more entertaining without the explicit and graphic sex scenes.  Most people know what goes on sexually between people, they don't need to have it rubbed in their faces.  Sans the graphic sex scenes, this would have been a 5 star.

Definitely NOT for family viewing....",1445212800,9,843,4.700680272108843

After the first episode, I was hooked!  I'm going to start reading the books now.  I have heard the the show does not deviate from the novel - great!  In this story, Claire falls through time to a different era and it is intriguing to see how she copes with the change, while also holding onto the hope of going back to her husband.  Watching her process, and seeing her relationships develop is captivating.  Each episode ends with a cliffhanger - which is incredibly annoying - but obviously hooks me into the seeing the next episode as soon as possible.  The actors are great eye candy, and there is detailed sex scenes, so not appropriate to watch with your kids and probably uncomfortable to watch with your mother-in-law!",1445126400,,866,4.607843137254902

7099307,4,B00VMIWA3O,Outlander had me hooked from the beginning. Interesting plot and great acting. Very cool period costumes and scenery. This newest season release had me slightly disappointed with so much graphic sex and nudity. It is just my opinion that sex can be led up to and everyone knows what is happening at that point. I feel like it is bordering on the edge of pornography. But I will continue watching it and hope that they find more substance in upcoming seasons and uphold the potential that it started with.,1445126400,,504,4.674157303370786

The last two episodes of Volume Two have so shocked my mind, I doubt I will ever be able to clear my head of the disturbing scenes of torture, violence and sexual assault.  It has ruined the entire Outlander experience for me.  The writers have done a disservice to Outlander fans and to Diana Gabaldon by focusing too much on the detailed and shocking scenes of violence, torture and sexual assault and not enough on the beautifully written story.  It must take a depraved mind to actually enjoy this kind of entertainment.",1445126400,10,575,4.607843137254902

The series is mostly true to the book, with a few changes and some things left out, due to time restraints. It has become somewhat of a date night for us with the right mix of love between a married couple and action.  We've been married for 40 years and it reminds us of some of the things that either brought us together or have kept us together.",1445126400,2,492,4.051546391752577

7099311,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Where I live doesn't have Starz tv and I never heard of the Outlander books by Diana Gabaldon. It was sheer luck that I walked in a local dvds store and bought the Outlander's dvd for the first half Season One. After watching the first half season, my God, I was completely hooked by the intense but well-paced story plot, the high-quality and bold production; the characters in it were all well-acted by charming actors and actresses -- especially the leading actor and actress. It's just magical! I enjoy it so much that I consider that it's one of the BEST tv productions I have seen in the recent years. Since then I have been recommending this series to friends and I ordered the second half of the Season One through Amazon as well as the published books. I enjoyed both the tv series and the printed matters even though they tell the same story in slight different ways -- they both are spell-binding. Honestly, after reading the book, I vote that the tv production has done a very good job for condensing the time and events happened in the book -- it's really a good adaptation of Gabaldon's time-travel story. After all, movies/tv productions and books of words are two different media, we are lucky to be treated with such good writing by Diana Gabaldon and tv production from Starz tv.",1445126400,7,1297,4.594827586206897

7099326,2,B00VMIWA3O,"Season One, Volume Two is just not very good.  It's a shame, really...the books were fantastic, the characters so well-cast, and Volume One really had a good feel for the characters and the events of the books.  Sure, it could not touch on all of the events in a 700+ page novel, but you understood why they skipped what they did and I felt that they chose key scenes.  But Volume Two seems to disregard the book in all but its broadest plot-wise sense.  The characters acted out of character:  Jamie just wouldn't have stomped into Lallybroch declaring himself Laird, Jenny was not predisposed to hate Claire, Murtagh would NOT have danced a jig on stage.  On Claire & Murtagh's search for Jamie in the book they went from village to village treating patients, because Claire was a well-known healer and Jamie would know that the English healer traveling the countryside was her.  I think if he heard of an English woman who sang weird songs for money he would have no inclination to look for her.  And above all, they stopped focusing on the growing love, friendship, and romance between Claire and Jamie...in the book, when Claire went back to the stones, you knew what a wrenching decision it was for her, and when she chose to stay you knew it was inevitable.  You also knew what a huge sacifice Jamie was making, and he was making it for her.  The show conveyed none of this...honestly, if I hadn't read the books I would have been puzzled as to why she would stay in a violent, primitive world when she had a loving husband back in her time.  The TV show just didn't make Claire & Jamie's love compelling enough.

Finally, in all honesty the shows are gettng boring.  I just finished dragging myself through The Search, and now I have the prison episode and the rape/torture episode left...and I am not sure I can work up enough interest to watch them.",1444953600,12,1859,4.546546546546547

7099345,1,B00VMIWA3O,"The details of the story have already been covered so I'm not going to repeat that, my review is concerning the rating.  Generally when a dvd is ""not rated"" it's because it could get a PG rating but the studio doesn't want to have the movie ignored by the General adult population.  But this time it's different, it is borderline X
Not Rated? 13 & up????  Should be rated R+, DIsturbing images, Graphic violence, Nudity throughout including full frontal & some of the violence is sexual in nature.  Seemed to find a reason to have a woman's breasts completely exposed in every episode.  All of these absolutely ruined the story for me.  I was intrigued with the story line and would have loved it and given it five stars if the gratutitous nudity and sexual assault was alluded to instead of so in my face.  Funnily enough, in the extras they said they didn't want to go sexual just to get an audience.  They spent more time filming that than following the plot. Everything is through the woman Claire's eyes  but this movie seemed to be filmed to attract a male audience.
Had so much potential, the cliff hangers at the end of every episode is a binge watchers dream  but I'm very, Very disappointed, won't watch another season to see what happens next.",1444867200,35,1254,4.558035714285714

These characters are dear to me.  So much so that I named my daughter Claire.  This is why I just can't stomach the series.

And the wait, being deceived by a company I have given a lot of money to? It was too much and I won't be buying season 2......or is it 3 now?

The acting is superb at all levels, but the intense sexual content, quite graphic in some scenes, definitely make this a tale for mature audiences only.

I like the story and the characters from the book, but I hated the ending enough that I lost interest in reading the rest of the series. I also read many reviews complaining that the Starz series was too violent and too graphic. I agree. This series is very violent and sexually graphic. The rape scenes and the nudity got old. (Then again, that is to be expected from series produced by the premium channels like Starz and HBO, etc.)

So why did I buy the first two seasons?  Call it curiosity. I still like the characters and the plot. I is also like the love story between Claire and Jamie. For the most part, I liked most of the episodes, especially episodes 2-6 from volume 2. (There are some good ones in volume 1 too.)  However, the last 2 episodes from volume 2 were so disturbing and brutal. The only way I could get through them was to fast forward through all the scenes with Jaimie and Black Jack.  What can I say, I don't enjoy watching people being raped and tortured.

Otherwise it was excellent since it did stay very close to the orig story line. I remember feeling shocked when I read all that detail too, but it does give insight into each person's character in how they dealt with such violation, and the extreme degree of base, vile, inhuman treatment coming from what appears the darkest of all seemingly soulless reprobate beings.",1444521600,,588,4.609523809523809

I was surprised to find out that my brother, with whom I share my Amazon content, had been waiting for volume 2, which speaks to how great this story is. It's just such a fantastic drama and something I will definitely be watching again.  It's for someone who loves historical fiction, anything highlands or Celtic, romance, drama, fantasy, and even action.  This show really has something for every one who likes a well-produced drama.

I love how honest and true to the book this story is.  I know people will love the sex scenes, but they are more real and well acted than many I have seen, and they really do a great job of showing how the writer intended them to come off (Not as smut designed to fluff a story, but a way to paint the bond between two people in love).

The tension between Jack Randall, Claire, and Jamie is palpable and I was actually thinking they would dance around the exchanges between Jamie and Jack, especially the culminating ones.  I thought for sure they'd worry that too many people would be offended by male rape and that homophobia might prevent them from telling the true story, but they stayed true and and not only that, and not only did they NOT dance around the subject, but they went the full monty (har har) with it.",1444435200,,1295,4.512820512820513

Not to worry, however, because Ron Moore's commitment to the accuracy of the book's will not offend even the most passionate fan.  Even Diana approves.  Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan are stellar as Claire and Jamie along with all the supporting actors.  The scenery of Scotland alone is breathtaking.  This is truly a unique, one-of-a-kind production, from the story itself to the behind-the-scenes evolution of the show.  The last two episodes are hard to watch, but even a conservative like myself appreciated the enormous talent of Mr. Heughan, Ms. Balfe, and Tobias Menzies.",1444262400,3,823,4.985294117647059

7099452,2,B00VMIWA3O,"I am torn because the cast and ""feel"" of the series are spot on and I enjoyed Volume One (although I did not enjoy watching Jamie being flogged.) I watched an interview before V-2 was released - the cast and crew were very matter of fact about how sexual content was integral to the book and they seemed to have a good feel for their audience.

I was puzzled why scenes should not follow the book more closely when there are 800 plus pages of material to choose from. Then the director decided to insert prolonged graphic (male/male) torture and rape scenes. I was shocked. These are events that do happen in the book but are revealed after the fact as part of the healing process- classic, if upsetting, ""hurt, comfort"" romance. The way the series is filmed it won't be enjoyable to re-watch. I will continue to enjoy ebook and audio versions.

I would like to see Season Two with theses distinctions: sex good/ torture bad (subtler sex is ok- do not have to see all body parts / the scars of torture are enough to deal with- do not wish to see them being inflicted.)",1444262400,13,1068,4.416243654822335

The first Volume was excellent and looked forward to the Second. Volume Two was frustrating and at times VERY hard to watch with a few good points. Sure they were making it ""darker"" - it was crazy times. But really? very disappointed. Not sure if we'll spend more money on this :P",1444262400,9,447,4.333333333333333

7099468,4,B00VMIWA3O,"There are so many things that are outstanding about this Volume 2 of Season One, from the incredible details of keeping the story and presentation accurate to the beautiful scenes and chemistry between Claire and Jaimie. But I must say that I could not watch the toture and rape scenes that were brutal and went on for what seems like hours. I kept fast forwarding to get out of it which is not as easy when you are live streaming it as if it was on a dvd. My husband who watched with me, and has not read the books, said, ""Well, was all of this in the books?"" I said, ""yes, but at least then you could skim it and skip over the parts and you did not have all the visuals and noises and great acting right in your face."" I really disagree with the choice here by the directors and author to so strongly dwell on this part of the book. After 15 minutes, I felt we totally got the horror and the brutality and understood how these acts shaped many other relationships and decisions that went on in the book, and books to follow.

7099476,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Good mixture of historic facts, historic fiction and science fiction. One can only hope that the author, TV writer, director and producer have not packed everything exciting into the first season...and the subsequent ones will just drag themselves along and fizzle out. I believe a lot will largely depend on the screenwriter, because  if you have actually read all of Diana Gabaldon's  7 or 8 books of the 'outlander series you will have noted that while they are all more than 700 pages, with the exception of the first one, the action often drags along, events sometimes seem unconnected and the author seemed to have gotten lost in trivial stuff instead of continuing with the actual ""meat"" of the story. The story also jumps around quite bit, some things simply remain unexplained, and the personalities which Ms. Gabaldon has attached to some of her later characters do not always seem to be the best choice. All in all, in the following books Jaimie and Claire are being robbed of a good portion of excitement that seemed to follow them throughout the first book and the first season. So let's see whether the coning tv seasons will be better and less confusing and at times tedious than the actual books
I would say that 5 of the 8 books are worth reading. Let us hope the TV series based on the 'outlander' novel will fare better",1444176000,,1338,4.68936170212766

I`m glad to hear DG likes how the episodes are turning out....strengthens my commitment to never purchase another book by her.  The books lost their luster by the time #4 rolled around.  Someone just let me know how it all ends.  If all you can come up with for a storyline is rape, torture, and sex then it`s time to move on to a new career.  Ron Moore you should end production of the series.  All you`re doing is destroying the one thing the books had going for them....the interactions between Jamie and Claire (conversations not sex!!!).  Sam and Catriona don`t kid yourselves....you`re doing soft porn.

That quality is very true to the books, although it makes certain scenes almost unwatchable (for me). The harshness of life in that era provides a counterpoint to the fantastical premise of time travel, though, being so grounded in the dark realities of human nature and of the earth itself.

7099543,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Where do I start? I am thoroughly impressed with how real and colorful the dialogue is for this show. I was completely drawn in and really identify with the characters as people (real people not Hollywood contrivances). I loved the books when I read them years ago, but I have fallen hard for the storyline as it's being told here. The person that wrote the screenplay for this needs to be held up as an example of writing about what real human interaction is all about (the complexity, the interplay of light and dark within ourselves, the tactile sensation of living and not just existing, loving someone so desperately that you'll do anything for that person ). Claire's character astounds me with the delicate balance of strength and vulnerability.  It's extremely hard to express in words, what has so eloquently and realistically been depicted on screen.

7099575,1,B00VMIWA3O,"When I first heard about this TV series, I was very excited. Having a doctorate in history, I have a deep appreciation for historical fiction that actually is well written and researched by the author. My particular area of study is Celtic history, and I have spent much time in Scotland and Ireland. All of that to say when I heard about Gabaldon's series that blended two of my favorite areas of history (WWII & Eighteenth Century Scotland) I was stoked. She carries high praise for a writer that seems to have a great grasp of highland clan life, language, and culture......BUT, this TV series is way over the top! What could have been such a good series is nothing less that sheer pornography. Both ""Outlander Seasons"" were in the garbage can last week, hopefully at the bottom of landfill by now. Is it really necessary for there to be endless sex, nudity, rape, and perversion scenes for you to be entertained?? Such garbage should not be necessary for good art. There are many other creative ways to be true to reality without turning sex into a spectators sport. Artistic integrity is not what puts sexual perversion on the screen. Underneath is an out of control sexual appetite that this industry plays into in hopes their ratings will go up! It is not good art that puts nudity on the movie screen, its prurience. For the masses that took pleasure in viewing such a series, it is an indicator of how serious your depravity is, for you no longer are satisfied to think on what is honorable. DON'T justify sick perverted things in the name of entertainment and amusement. Ask anyone who has been sexually abused if they would enjoying watching such a TV show such as this. Or a father if he would be happy for his daughter or son to play in such a acting role. Human dignity and beauty should not be sold so cheaply. So, agreeing with some others, you have to be a very sadistic person to conceive writing such a script or to enjoying watching this on the screen. In short...this series is trash, don't buy it.

Some who have not watched it but still put a post out there saying they will not get it because of the rape scene, --- it's not horrific, sad? Absolutely, but it is still well done, acting is well done, the effects well done. I just wish the movie kept going, I guess I'll have to wait till 2016. The only complaint I have is it wasn't accurate to the book, a lot of the movie was not in the book, which is disappointing. But I still love the acting, very well performed.",1444089600,,539,4.046728971962617

But....the final episode with Jamie being horribly tortured sexually by Jack Randall was just way over the top!  I had to fast forward to the end.  Yes, it was somewhat in keeping with the book version....but the book was written with a bit more discretion. We don't have to see it all to know it happened. A person can only stomach so much torture, sexual molestation and rape from one man to another man. Awful to watch....well I couldn't very long!  I hope Season 2 will be less gratuitous.",1443916800,3,622,4.5675675675675675

Eight episodes and you have to wait months for more? Ridicules! I paid $14 a month for Starz in order to watch this ONE show $168 a year, the channel has nothing else I wanted to see; movies I've already seen. I could have bought the stupid DVD for $22 at Wallyworld!! Which is what I will do to see the rest...if there is a ""rest"" to see.

Claire, our heroine,  and other beloved female characters lurch from one contrived situation involving gratuitous female nudity to the next, while male characters remain modest and retain their dignity.

7099592,3,B00VMIWA3O,"I love the casting and acting in this series. The scenery is just beautiful. Season 1 Volume 1 was amazing and passionate, and I binge watched it because I had to know what happened next. Everything was there to make me an addict for the life of the series. However, in this volume, I found myself looking away in embarrassment during the pornographic sex scenes and had to fast forward the torture scenes in the final episode of Volume 2. The story is much more captivating and beautiful without all of this. The actors portray feeling so well that such graphic scenes aren't necessary. I hope they go back to the fine storytelling of the first volume from now on.",1443916800,7,665,4.55
7099593,1,B00VMIWA3O,"I was completely captivated by season 1, volume 1, so much so that I purchased and read the first 4volumes, approximately 1,000 pages each.  Needless to say, I counted the days until the release of volume 2.  I had the set as my first two choices with Netflix and on the first day of release purchased the DVD knowing I would want it as part of
my all things Outlander. Wise choice on my part-- I couldn't wait to return my purchase!  Much of this volume 2, season 1 should have ended up on the editing floor.  Ms. Gabaldon had no trouble in expressing the horror depicted in words.  This could and should have been done better without subjecting your fans to unforgettable images disguised as ""entertainment"".  Have new editing room/screenwriters been employed?  To sink to your level for a moment, disc one could be entitled ""Nipples"" and disc 2  ""The Gut Wrenching Depravity of Man"", all disguised as ""entertainment"".

Where is the beautiful scene at the monastery?  In future episodes, please do not subject your fans to such graphic brutality visually -- there has to be a better way!

On yet another thought please include the same ""extras"" on both regular DVD's as are on Blu ray.  I will now always view through Netflix before buying.  I have watched the first season, volume 1 no less than 9 times so far, and NEVER intend to watch volume 2 again.

Honestly, it sucked .... and, yes, there's some of that in there as well ...  Lots of male and female sex as well, full-frontal nudity and so on. ..... I'm not a prude, but the sex in this set of shows did not add to the story - rather, it detracted from it ....  .. Then Jamie went from seriously injured with PTSD to oh-I'm-fine in just 2-3 scenes and they sailed happily off to France ....

That said, I was disappointed in the portrayal of Outlander. Follow the book - take the dialogue from it (which they did somewhat). The acting by the actors is excellent but I just didn't feel J & C had much of a connection as I viewed each episode especially the last 4.  I found some of the scenes tedious and boring.  The torture scene between Jamie and Black Jack was not necessary to go on as long as it did.  Give it 5 minutes to get the point across and move on. Why spend so much time on these horrible acts and less on the healing aspect. Maybe the writers think the public would prefer torture to healing? Which it seems they were right after reading so many positive reviews. I doubt I will buy Season 2 (I don't get Starz) but watching this DVD has wet my appetite to return to the books and read them again.",1443657600,3,987,4.173684210526316

OK, I found out that if you have a 32"" screen or below and deon't have a DVD HD/Blu-ray player, that you can't get the Collector's Edition as that is in HD/Blu-ray and not VISIBLE on a small screen..You have to have a screen that is 40"" and above ..wish DTV/TV sellers and Amazon would ALL tell you of that when buying things!

7099635,4,B00VMIWA3O,Love Outlander.  I've read all the books so it's great seeing the story played out.  The only thing is the sexual content.  A little embarrassing when your watching it with your kids.  I think the story can still be told without all the detailed sexual/nudity scenes.  I'm not being prudish but feel that it's a little to much.  Can't wait for another season.,1443657600,2,359,4.619047619047619

7099646,1,B00VMIWA3O,"I love the show but the episodes stream poorly on Roku.  It's so frustrating.  It must have stopped to load a dozen times.  So this is a review for the instant video, not the show.  I'm happy to throw down $2 an episode for this kind of show, but it really sucks when it takes twice as long as it should to watch, and there's no way to fix it.  It's like repeated commercial breaks right in the middle of a scene.  Argh!  I bought the first half of the season as a package in HD and that streamed fine.  But the second half, regular version (cheapest to pay per episode of non-HD) has streamed badly for the first two episodes.  It's not our internet connection.  We checked that, and other streaming programs on Roku are working fine.",1443657600,2,735,4.260869565217392
7099647,3,B00VMIWA3O,"What a bummer that after such a wonderful, engrossing, magnificent first volume for the season, they had to stumble so hard with this second half. I understand that the rape and torture happened in the book. I am not terribly squeamish (I have sat through GoT and Spartacus without a blink) and I am not the least bit homophobic, but I do think there is a limit. Watching an ENTIRE episode full of rape and torture was too much. It didn't have to be so graphic. I was willing to pay whatever the silly prices were to buy both of these ""collector's editions"" and ended up disappointed in the last portion of the second volume. I wish they had just insinuated a bit more or maybe, at the very least, dedicated a bit more to the healing that occurs in the book. It isn't just dark and dreary sodomy!

Its not working and says that it cant find the movie for the code I entered -- which maybe means that it has not been uploaded to ultraviolet yet or something -- not happy -- I have tried multiple times too.  I downloaded the last volume with no problem on release date --  I will try to get a return quick if I still cant get it to work.

Thanks to the producers, directors, and Diana Gabaldon for all of the abused partners and rape victims out there who have had their experience romanticized, making it even more difficult for them to leave a toxic situation.  I can't imagine what goes on in this author's head that she thought that scene was anything other than destructive.  If that's romance, then I want no part of it.",1443571200,17,466,4.775

I have seen reviews talking about the sex and rape scenes and how it offends them, and to those of you who are easily offended and don't like to watch the depths of human emotion and despair then this show is not for you.  But to those of you who like to watch, and read for that matter, shows that allow you to witness the human portrayal of both happiness and despair then you will be elated with this series!!  In reality the good guy does not always win, and to witness the hero and heroine struggle with the obstacles, that have been thrown in their way and still come out fighting is amazing to watch!!

From the casting, costumes, and location Starz nailed this one on the head.  After reading the books and then hearing that they were going to be turned into a series I thought that they could never find actors who could fill the rolls and represent the characters, but I was gladly proven wrong.

7099656,5,B00VMIWA3O,"And the five stars also go to the explicit and excruciating end of the season with the BJR and Jamie rape/torture scene.  My response to another person's negative comment about this is:

""After having read all the books and bulges, I knew what was coming. You can always put a book down if it becomes disturbing. And the same with this series. I watched the last episodes in bits and pieces, as I could tolerate them. I actually finally was able to watch the last two episodes in entirety yesterday. And as disgusting the scenes are (what happened, not the depictions), you have to admit that the acting of both the BJR and Jamie characters is amazing!""

While there are some talented cast members (not naming names either way, nothing good to come of that), most of the characters have been written so as to be unrecognizable, and in particular, I've found very little to like about the main characters as they've been written for the show.  The plot has been mangled, taking out really great scenes in favor of new ones that are just painfully bad (the ""Boogie Woogie"" scenes have to take the cake on that), and I'm a little embarrassed to have been excitedly recommending the show before it started, thinking it would be of GoT quality.

Especially when listening to the accents and the beautiful lyrical language and rolling sounds of the Scottish accents that you cannot realize just from reading unless you know the culture I suppose. Not many shows/movies enhance the book as this does, although Out of Africa comes to mind as another one. Thank you to Ms. Gabaldon and STARZ for a wonderful collaboration to bring us a sense of another time, culture and far away place that is for those of us truly romantic at heart.",1442620800,,622,4.612612612612613

7099719,5,B00VMIWA3O,"The second Volume,as I understand it, is not available until 9/29/15. The first volume impresses one particularly with Claire and Jamie; the chemistry is amazing and an historical drama is fascinating. I majored in history in college and 18th century Europe is my favorite historical period. Women have no power whatsoever,yet Outlander doesn't ruin the story based on historical accuracy. Claire, coming from the 20th century is a phenomonon in 18th century Scotland and in the upcoming second volume which apparently takes place in 18th century Paris. The costumes are apparently amazing.

I 'love' a believable romance and through volume 1,Claire has NOT,yet given up on an attempted and hopeful return to 20th century Britain,following WW2. I have often been 'peeved', at times with the insistence that the primary characters are beautiful or extraordinarily handsome but this formula works especially well with Outlander. For the historians among us; John Prebble's books and Sir Walter Scott's novels have always made this period a romantic one. Knowing that Culloden is 2 years away brings a focus to the series which defines great historical fiction. I recommend this series for all who treasure a good love story and those who want to learn about European history near our American Revolution!",1442361600,26,1302,5.2898550724637685

7099740,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This review is for the entire first season - not just the second half!!

The absolute best show on TV!!!!! I had never read the books until I found Outlander on the Starz Channel. I binge watched most of the first half of the season in one night and finished the last three episodes of the first half the next morning. I very rarely, if ever, binge watch anything. This show grabbed on to me and wouldn't let go from the first show. When I found out it was a book adaptation, I ordered all eight books and started reading and was almost finished before the second half of the season started (two months later). I am not one of those Book Snobs who bad mouth this series because it is not word for word/scene for scene exactly like the book. There are just some things that will not work on TV. Like the author of the books has said probably more than once, put the book down and enjoy the show for what it is - an adaptation. And yes, they deal with some hard issues in both the books and the TV a... Read more",1441756800,6,1010,4.126903553299492

I stumbled upon this book years ago by accident and once I started to read, I could not put it down.  In my opinn this novel is the best of its kind....kind of the way The Lord of the Rings is the best of its genre...and once having read it, anything else seems a pale imitation.  If you enjoyed reading Outlander (and the novels that continue the story) I recommend this adaptation very highly.",1441411200,3,492,4.157894736842105
7099746,2,B00VMIWA3O,"I agree with others that the price for the two volumes is very high for the total number of episodes.  I was also disappointed with the second half of the series, especially the last two episodes.  While the acting was superb, there was way too much time and focus on the graphic and disturbing elements, and way too little on the very moving and joyful elements that were in the book.  For example, the horrible rape could have been alluded to in a few scenes of a few seconds each, instead of devoting many very long and horrid minutes to it, which would have allowed time for us to see Jamie's healing, and the book's lovely was of announcing her pregnancy (which in the TV series was wooden and a huge let down).  If I had not read the books to know what was coming, I would not even want to watch the next season.",1441324800,9,818,4.258064516129032

7099751,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Without a doubt this is the best show on television, bar none.  The quality & production from the tiniest details to the most magnificent are first rate from start to finish.  It's the kind of show you can't watch just once.  Each viewing releases more and more of the magic, romance and incredible story for the viewer to soak into.  Reading Diana's books only adds to the layered effects as well as the story lines via Ron Moore's guidance. His interpretation for the series leaves one breath-taken with the scenery, music and overall impact of the amazing romance.  I've found watching episodes either in order or out of order again and again much like reading poetry.  The impressions one takes away from watching true beauty in its best illustration - even when the plots thicken into horror - is something you will never forget.  I am in awe with Diana's vast imagination and Ron's depth of talent to turn these sublime stories into sheer classics of the very best kind. How can one argue with perfection much less quibble with its cost?",1440028800,11,1043,4.697802197802198

7099753,5,B00VMIWA3O,"For anyone who has not read the books prior to watching the series - watch out!  There is a horribly graphic and extensive ""scene"" in the book and it sounds like the series stuck pretty close to the book.  I have read the series many times, and intentionally skip over this part.  To some extent, I think one needs to get the idea of what happened to Jaime in order to understand how difficult his recovery is and all the things he goes through later as he grows and heals etc.  Rest assured, although sex is a common recurring event throughout the series.  This is the worst.  And unless they depart from the book (I doubt it) I think it can be safely said that all can go back to watching the rest of the series without fear of this same level of - well, I'm not sure what to call it - but, as far as I remember, the worst is over and we can get back to the story which is so wonderful without fear of any similar scenes taking us by surprise.  If you haven't watched the series yet (I haven't) it sounds from other reviews that this graphic scene is the last of the season?  Definitely good to know so that one can skip it if so inclined.",1439078400,10,1141,4.108108108108108
7099754,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I know what you're thinking - 90 something dollars for one season of a TV show?! Expensive yes but when I think of how many times I'm going to rewatch it's worth it. I was so happy with the amount of extra features in Vol. 1, I'm looking forward to what Vol. 2 has in store for us. Fans of the series will be happy with the TV adaptation. The casting is perfect (Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser is everything) and Vol. 2 seems to be taking enough creative licence to keep fans guessing, particularly the scenes with Laoghaire.

Davina Porter who reads it is fantastic if you are thinking about doing that.  The books are so good.  I can't wait to see Sam and Cait portray Jaime and Claire through all the books.

7099762,1,B00VMIWA3O,Such a disappointment after the first half of this season. The final episode was disturbingly graphic and it seemed as though there was not enough time dedicated to Claire and Jamie's reunion following so much darkness and tragedy.,1437264000,21,231,5.105263157894737
7099763,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Season 1 - Volume Two of Outlander is gritty, realistic, sometimes hard to watch, and I found it completely impossible to tear myself away from it. Yes, there is nudity, but the nudity is nothing more than present in the story, and I am a typical American prude and did not find it offensive. The last two episodes were sometimes hard to watch as they courageously tackled the issues of torture and rape in a disturbingly realistic manner. These things are occurring daily today in war and terror torn parts of the world and closing our eyes to it does not make it go away. Outlander approaches these things from the correct perspective of truth, showing them to be the desire of evil people to dominate and control, nothing to do with sex. The psychological effects are explored in depth, and yes it hard to watch Jamie and Claire struggle through these two episodes, coming to terms with the aftermath of evil. If the end of this season does not tear your heart out, you may not have one, but it is an incredible testament to the power of love. The closing scene of the final episode, To Ransom A Man's Soul, left my eyes filled with tears of joy and hope for these wonderful characters for Season Two.

From a technical standpoint, the history and geographical beauty of Scotland is nothing less than another character that does not appear in the list of credits. The acting is truly the best I have ever seen. It was intensely done, sometimes funny, sometimes painful, I could see nothing of the actors in the characters. The characters were simply their own beings, as if they were truly living individuals. Always, adding to the beauty of Scotland, the joy of love, the intensity of a whole range of emotions, is the amazing music of Bear McCreary, surely one of the most talented people in the industry. Outlander is the best thing I have ever watched and I am looking forward to Season Two more than I can say.",1437004800,200,1918,4.559420289855073

Sam Heughan and Tobias Menzies in particular manage to deliver a stunning performance that completely drew me in and made me hate Black Jack all the more, and cry for Jaime and Claire's sake. It's hard to describe, but some of the scenes were the most horrible that I've ever watched on TV, but at the same time they were the best acted and depicted that I have ever seen (if that makes any sense).

Not just your average 18th century Romance novel, this also goes into the politics and strife that lead to the Uprising of '45 and the battle at Culloden.  The scenery is breathtaking, and they put more than a little effort into the costumes.  There are certain adult situations that are probably not suitable for younger viewers.  I thought it was a bit pricey, and I would recommend watching an episode or two before you decide to invest in this.",1436140800,4,507,4.6

Yes- there are graphic scenes in this episode, not one to watch around kids. Better enjoyed curled up in bed next to the one you love. Without giving any spoliers: it does get graphic towards the end. This is a NECESSARY part of the story! Everything that happens to Jamie and Claire are important foundation building blocks of their relationship. I'm glad R. Moore didn't shy away from this. Kudos to him!

7099781,5,B00VMIWA3O,"This review is for the entire first season - not just the second half!!

The absolute best show on TV!!!!!  I had never read the books until I found Outlander on the Starz Channel.  I binge watched most of the first half of the season in one night and finished the last three episodes of the first half the next morning.  I very rarely, if ever, binge watch anything.  This show grabbed on to me and wouldn't let go from the first show.  When I found out it was a book adaptation, I ordered all eight books and started reading and was almost finished before the second half of the season started (two months later).  I am not one of those Book Snobs who bad mouth this series because it is not word for word/scene for scene exactly like the book.  There are just some things that will not work on TV.  Like the author of the books has said probably more than once, put the book down and enjoy the show for what it is - an adaptation.  And yes, they deal with some hard issues in both the books and the TV adaptation.  They don't sugar coat the hard life that was the 1700's.  You want fairy tale Cinderella, then buy/watch Cinderella.  If you want to experience something close to what it must have been like in the 1700's (for women especially), then watch this series.  Yes, there are some rough moments (especially episodes 115 and 116), but the acting in those last two episodes is so stellar that IMHO, you are missing out on some Emmy caliber performances if you don't watch them.  And trust me, it goes into much more detail in the books than they could ever do on TV.",1435017600,14,1575,4.291525423728814

7099783,5,B00VMIWA3O,I have been a fan of the books for years and was so excited for it to become a show. I was nervous how it would turn out. Books don't always adapt well to TV but they did an amazing job. I had all the episodes on my DVR and watched them over and over. I will now be watching my DVD over and over. The only thing I'm disappointed with is that the bluray version has a lot more special features than the regular DVD.,1434844800,5,414,3.8255813953488373
7099784,3,B00VMIWA3O,Love the books & Love the series!!! Had to put my 2 cents in after reading some of the comments. Having read the books why are you surprised with the content in the series & I'm sure you are talking about the last 2 episodes. Not trying to change your minds but try listening to Ron D Moore's podcasts for insight into the reasoning on what was & was NOT shown. As to cost; I am on a fixed income so $50 doesn't come easy. Eight episodes are equivalent to 4 first run movies which would be about $25 each...guess it's all relative...what were  you willing to pay for the books?!?!  Diana herself is pleased with the ADAPTATIONS.,1434672000,9,628,4.313559322033898

I had to purchase the DVD and give that a go ... Now I'm flaming well hooked.  Only trouble being that you cannot get anything for us English unless
you pay the earth and it's confusing with Area code B or Code 1.  Plus when I purchased this DVD and actually received it I thought great with
the free Ultra Violet for my iPad I was in 7th heaven, but it would not be recognised and so I lost out there and they said because it was an import it could not be downloaded so just beware... No freebies on that score.  But the film itself is superb and Jamie ... well I don't think if you searched the world over you would get a better actor for the part, the nuances that he puts into the scenes well ... Perfect.  All in all it's got to be without doubt (even tops my Gone with the wind) the best absolute very best film of our time.",1434585600,9,974,4.052083333333333

7099787,1,B00VMIWA3O,"What a shame....this series started out great with alot of historical charm and a great plot...but as the episodes marched along the storyline and quality began to quickly erode.  Not sure if it was changing writers or just the wierd perversions of the director.  It seems the actors are trying to maintain sense of dignity but just can no longer measure up.  The ridiculous nudity, a cornball rendition of the 1940s tune ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" that would never end, and the overly graphic violence and barbarous rape scenes became an utter waste of my time.  As a historian with Scottish ancestry this whole thing is quite insulting.  Keep the kids out of the room if you are going to subject yourself to this series.

7099790,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Not being able to get the Starz Network, I only learned bits and drips about this tv series from the media praising the caliber of this production.  Finding them on Facebook to learn more, while seeing all the positive comments, I was drawn to purchase the 1st in book series by Diana Galabon.  She's one master story teller and captured my attention page by page, whereby you want to keep reading and reading.  Hence, I purchased Season One without even knowing if all the buzz was worthy.  Outlander is solid to sink your teeth into, and filmed expertly with lots of attention to detail. Having visited Scotland this year, I can see why this country has appeal as a cinematic one - it is gorgeous.  I haven't come across any other historical take on a country, it's inhabitants, it's romance and strife that has been as enthralling as Outlander.  Credit goes to R. Moore as director, and Diana for writing an excellent series of books. Sam and Caitriona are excellent actors and bring this show to life.  Am not impervious to the violence and sex, which is treated realistically and tastefully.  Being a Scot by family lineage I now appreciate learning about the Jacobites and am drawn into learning even more. Keep the series going, it's far better than Game of Thrones for all the right reasons.",1434153600,16,1299,4.691629955947136
7099791,1,B00VMIWA3O,"Wonderful series.  I throughly enjoyed it, but why, oh why, did they have to get so graphic about Jamie.  Yes, it was ""in the book"", but this kind of graphic display was beyond horrible.  We purchased the first half of the season, but we are not going to purchase this half.  The last two episodes go into god-awful gory detail, and while some explanation of what happened to Jamie is necessary, it does not have to go into horrific mode.  Porn I can deal with, but this was not porn, it was horror.  If I want to see a movie about human torture, go see Saw I, II and III (no, I did not watch those either).  Perhaps some people get off on this kind of stuff, but my wife and I were completely horrified.  We watched hoping it would get better, but it just kept going deeper and darker.

The Screen Writer, the Director and Producer, are, in my opinion, sick.  Keep going down this road, for you have, at least, lost this audience.",1433808000,51,931,4.268571428571429

I'm so happy there is finally an epic tale like this for women--romance and love instead of the usual sex and lewd behavior... Not that I dislike Game of Thrones, but this is more my style.",1433635200,10,317,4.19672131147541
7099794,1,B00VMIWA3O,"Yeah. I saw lots of reviews posted elsewhere. This one and the ones on Sansa Stark's rape seem to be major news in the TV world. But here I'll stick with Outlander. I liked the overall take on the TV series initially. I loved the gorgeously shot setting; the detail that was put into the historical dress for the time period; the Gaelic interspersed with the English drew me in further to the physicality of the place and time. This was all well done. The casting was also very well done. But there is a limit, and even a great TV series that hits all of the right notes, will stumble occasionally.

I was loving the affection and the slowly evolving relationship between Jamie and Claire, which caused me to tune in each week. But that ended a couple episodes back. I found Jamie withdrawing from Claire, or beginning to distance himself from her during ""The Watch"" episode. In that episode, Claire kisses Jamie goodbye, and Jamie doesn't even react to the kiss. Mood killer. And since that episode, the rest of the closeness of Jamie and Claire has been ""dying/languishing."" For me, something has been ""off"" between them since that episode, and has stayed that way.

Anyway, this last episode was underwhelming, too. I rate it a ""8"" not because Sam Heughan and Tobias Menzies didn't ""step it up"" with their acting. No, they most certainly did step it up with their acting, and the result was mind-numbing and was cringe-worthy. But the rest of this episode besides the flashbacks was TOTALLY NOT on the same level. The result is a disjointed ending.

I read the book, sure, and for most of the TV series, they did adhere quite well to the book. I'm not saying DG was phenomenal in writing the first book, but I do think Ron Moore, the director, took a nosedive with this last episode of the show, when he proceeded to not give equal gravity to the healing scenes between Claire and Jamie in the monastery, and only provided the rape/torture scenes between BJR and Jamie.

Claire's few scenes with Jamie in this episode were wooden. Heughan stayed on target with the theme from the book, where Jamie succumbs to the mental torture he has endured at BJR hands. Claire was rather dissociated from Jamie, and during her early signs of pregnancy, she kept fainting all during this episode.  There were very little ""scenes"" of healing going on for Jamie. Ron Moore and the company producers basically glossed over all of the ""healing scenes"" provided in he book in order to make the episode ""grittier"" and all about the rape of Jamie.

 Graphic sex scenes between lovers are the norm these days. It's not everyone's cup of tea. That's granted.  But graphic rape scenes shown on TV, with practically nothing else going on for the entire episode... is purely BAD SCREENWRITING.  Sure, the rape of Jamie is understood in the book, and could have been reflected in small glimpses of flashback.  But what happened is that an entire 15-35 minutes of a 1 hour episode was devoted to showing the rape in all of its grisly detail.  Honestly, that's not an episode of TV.  That's torture porn, or akin to watching footage of terrorists doing beheadings on screen for an hour. ( If that's what you do for entertainment...then, okay).  And that's why the second half of season one, I think, is worse than the first half.  Jamie and Claire's relationship is supposed to change because of the rape, yes, but their relationship should not be hitting the skids before the rape even happens.  Also,  using a whole episode to show rape is not telling a story.  It's making the rest of the ""story's plot"" come to a screeching halt.

Save yourself some of the misery of trying to watch the finale of this season. Just go read the book's slightly detached ( but really horrific on its own) version, instead. The book version will make you feel bad, but it will not make you feel like you had just stuck your head in the toilet for an hour, with images you still can't erase from your mind.",1433635200,88,3964,4.606534090909091
7099795,5,B00VMIWA3O,"I have nothing but good things to say about this show and about the novels.  I began devouring these books a little while ago and am currently on the third one. I get why people are upset about the male rape scene. It upset me when I read it but it was supposed to. It is a key element of the story that is essential to the growth and relationship between Claire and Jamie.  They were never NOT going to show it, and it's Starz, not Lifetime, so for those of us who are upset at how graphic it was, it was sort of to be expected. Those of us who read the books were well prepared for that scene and the overwhelming reaction from book readers was that these scenes were extremely well done and captured the horror and heartbreak that we all felt while reading Jamie's account of what happened to him in prison. You're just going to have to be okay with this going in, and if you're not then I would highly recommend finding another show.  This story is not for everyone, but if you can bear through the rape scene (which is the worst moment in the novels I've read so far) you will be greatly rewarded with Claire and Jamie's story, which is a story about the real, nitty-gritty type of love that exists beyond moments when everything is going smoothly and wonderfully.  Most Hollywood romances don't take us past the courtship period, and so rarely do we see what happens to the lovers after they are already married and taking on life's ups and downs together.  I have been consistently inspired by Gabaldon's writing and highly encouraged people to read her work, even if they do not make it past season one of the show.",1433635200,18,1623,4.360927152317881

I was surprised with Season One because not knowing the actors etc. .It was a pleasure to finally see Outlander on TV .The series was excellent. It followed Diana's books nearly to a tee.. Acting was  excellent . Everything about it was so good I have reread the books and watched Season one as often as I was able too. Season  Two was even better. I know people are not happy to see the torture and rape but it was in the book and it tells the  life story of  Jamie and Claire .What life's hardships they endured . We see it in our lives today the same hardships. We can actually feel their pain and happiness. When we can do that either reading the books or seeing on screen that is excellent work all around..

7099804,1,B00VMIWA3O,"This review contains a spoiler alert!

Finally made it through to the Season 2 finale and I am absolutely finished with this series! The graphic rape and torture scenes overshadow any romance or plot it had going for it, and seem mostly gratuitous. I had hopes when I started watching as Ronald Moore is involved, but it is just like all the other Starz series: beautifully filmed with decent acting, but riddled with silly writing and loaded with sex and violence. I watch a lot of cable series, so porn doesn't bother me - the really excessive violence on Starz does. I almost quit watching after season 1 as that season ended naturally with the heroine about to be raped - she is saved in the nick of time but not before her bare butt and bosom are well displayed for the audience. Season 2 was far more degrading and humiliating for men and women. It was a real chore to watch. There was one moment when we discover another character traveled there from 1969 (a clue would be when she started using the F word - not something even Claire's generation tossed out liberally). I watched the rest of the season to learn more about that, but it was never mentioned again. They mostly focused on prison scenes, rapes scenes and more rape scenes. Oh yes and a silly witchcraft trial straight out of the 1960's soap opera Dark Shadows. You've been warned!

Might be interesting to fans of the books. As for me, I am through watching and not likely to read one of the books now in case they are even half as silly and violent as this show.",1433116800,45,1534,4.4361702127659575

I also commend the very talented actors.  That said,  I echo reviewer ""M&M"" regarding the gratuitously graphic sex.  It detracts from the story and the romance of the story.  No prude I, but in my considered opinion, it would have been far superior treatment of the love story had the producers/writers left the love-making to the imagination.  Think Rhett carrying Scarlet up that enormous staircase in Gone with the Wind.  Or Jean-Baptiste's donned clothes and sword in front of the fireplace in the film Desiree, with the couple's voices off-camera.  I cancelled Starz and won't be buying or watching Volume Two.",1430352000,41,768,4.801526717557252

I gave it two stars because the choice of characters is excellent, but...I am very disappointed and offended that they chose to have so much nudity and bloody gore.  I know Diana Gabaldon took liberties with this in her books, but it was not necessary to include it on the screen.  They shout freedom of speech, but what about good taste.  Before anyone says something about my comment and what they perceive as my lack of sexuality, excuse me, but I definitely don't have problems in that area.  I just don't want people lined up at my bedroom door and I don't want to be lined up at theirs.  That is a special part of life that is for two people that love each other.  It is no wonder that our youth think it is OK to have sex in a room full of people when we let them watch this and praise and laugh at the shows.  I was told by Timewarner when I subscribed for Starz that it was more family oriented than the other movie channels.  Wow, they were so wrong and Starz will be cancelled very soon.  It is a shame that a wonderful Scottish love story is turned into an R, or is that X, rated show for TV with sex as the main theme.  Life is so much more and this was shown in many scenes and well played by the characters, but then the focus turned to how many different ways and how often the sex act can be displayed.  I heard some of the stars speak of wearing modesty patches when filming.  Do they actually think that saves their modesty?  The recent episode where Jack Randall couldn't ""perform"" with full frontal view was disgusting.  I kept hoping it would get better, but with this show, my TV was turned off.  Too many parents let their young children watch shows of this kind and their innocence is taken away.  We all know of the horrors of a battlefield and that era of Scottish history is no different, but it doesn't need to be portrayed in such vivid detail.  Again, I am disappointed, but I am sure the majority really don't care.",1430006400,64,2118,4.236907730673317

Thats almost $40!!  Im interested in seeing the following seasons but won't at that price.  I think you are getting a little greedy.",1533772800,,297,4.653846153846154
8710588,3,B00VMIWA3O,I was a fan of season one but season 2 seemed like it was drug out in order to fill time and the story line was lacking.,1533686400,,120,3.4814814814814814
8710589,4,B00VMIWA3O,"I loved it, but I think there is way too much gratuitous sex. Yeah, they have a lot of sex, we get it. They could have put a lot more into the show if they cut out some of the sex. Honestly, Catriona demeans herself. It would be better to leave a bit to the imagination. Far sexier that way.",1533254400,,291,3.8666666666666667
8710590,5,B00VMIWA3O,"Absolutely amazing! I have been told about this series for years, but only recently got around to reading the books and watching the STARZ dramatization. I found the two main characters as portrayed by Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan true to the books in every way. As a fan of Celtic history, and Scottish lore in particular, I found the settings, costumes, and dialects beyond satisfying. So far, I have read Book One and
watched Season One with avid obsession. I've cried uncontrollably in parts, sometimes for joy, sometimes for grief. The story definitely evokes strong emotions, which is part of its allure. Once drawn into the drama, it is impossible to forget or to set aside. It becomes an obsession almost immediately.",1532995200,,728,4.926829268292683
