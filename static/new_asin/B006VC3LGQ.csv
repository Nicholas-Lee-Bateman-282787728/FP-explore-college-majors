5020516,5,B006VC3LGQ,"The first time I saw Jo Koy was at the Laugh Factory in Hollywood as one stop of many for my Bachelor party. He did his sketch about Orange Chicken and Chinese People. To this day I still recite that joke everywhere I go. A year later for my 1 year anniversary, I took my wife to see him so she knew who I was impersonating over the past 12 months. We both had a blast that night and got Jo Koy's signature on a DVD. Flash forward 7 years. I was dying to take my customer in Miami out to see Jo Koy and made sure my wife joined me on this trip. Being slightly buzzed, I kept yelling out ""Orange Chicken"" when Jo paused between jokes. Finally he called me out on it and said ""What does this guy have....chinese food terrets?""....he kept on going with his Light's Out bit after shutting me down. Good times. Afterwards, I told him about how we had been huge fans going back to his Orange Chicken days. He busted up and gave us both T-Shirts, a new Signed DVD, and a hat. We love Jo Koy and can't wait for his next release!!!",1364169600,5,1022,4.064356435643564
