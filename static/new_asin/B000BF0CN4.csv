2414971,5,B000BF0CN4,"Russia has seen many fascinating rulers over the centuries, and perhaps foremost among the list of Russian czars is Peter the Great. Coming to power at the end of the 17th century, Peter instituted sweeping social changes in the land and carved out the first true Russian empire. His influence was vast and far-reaching, but his is still a mixed legacy, as the good he did is offset to some degree by the violence unleashed by his tyrannical ruling style.

Russia had never seen anyone like Peter, especially not in the role of czar. He had no use whatsoever for the stagnant nature of traditional Russian life, and the cornerstone of his reign was the forced modernization of the country. He harbored a hatred of Russian traditionalism, and from his childhood days he developed an undying fascination with the western European lifestyle. He was determined to modernize Russia for its own good - no matter how many people had to die and suffer in the process. It is that element of tyranny that generated unease among his subjects and resonates still today in the historical interpretation of this unique Russian emperor.

He became the undisputed ruler of Russia at the age of 17. At 6'7"", he bore an imposing figure; he adopted western dress and grooming and eventually forced the Russian people to adopt western fashion, as well. He ignored (and later exiled) his frumpy wife and unloved son Alexei, preferring the feminine charms of those ladies with a western background; he later fell in love with and married a commoner, and he allowed the people to reject arranged marriages and choose their own spouses, as well. His fascination with the West was only strengthened by a tour of the European continent in his early 20s. He was especially enamored with the Dutch and their seafaring ways. It's almost impossible to believe, but he voluntarily worked as a ship's laborer in a Dutch shipyard for four months - while he was the undisputed czar of Russia. He had military advisers from the west even as a child, and the ""play army"" he commanded in his childhood developed into the heart of the modern army Peter sent to war against the Turks and, later, the Swedes in an effort to expand his empire.

This video points out the grand accomplishments of Peter and contrasts them with the more problematic aspects of his rule. Peter did revolutionize and modernize a Russia mired in the past and resistant to change of any sort: he vastly expanded industries such as mining and manufacturing, built a standing army trained in the western military tradition, built Russia's first navy, built (through the blood of thousands of forced laborers) the magnificent city of St. Petersburg, increased the number of schools and allowed non-noble students to pursue an education, and revolutionized the military, courts, and civil service by establishing service rather than privilege as the source for promotion and advancement. All of these positive reforms (not all of which were embraced by the people) came at a price, of course: war with Sweden lingered for more than twenty years, thousands of men were conscripted to fight or build Peter's grand city of St. Petersburg, and all Russians bore higher taxes as the means to pay for Peter's improvements. The nobility, as you might expect, did not care for their loss of privilege, and the traditional Russian society feared that western influence robbed the people of its innate Russian essence.

Toward the end of Peter's reign, he began to fear that his son Alexei, whom he had never loved or paid any attention to, was conspiring with the Russian nobility and certain European nations to overthrow him - and we now know that his fears in this regard were not groundless. Nevertheless, Peter had his son tortured and killed (well, actually, he died mysteriously before he could be executed), and many folks cannot get past the fact that Peter could treat his own son so cruelly.

Peter the Great was a fascinating man who left a permanent legacy on Russia and her people. Peter's story is essentially the story of the birth of modern Russia, a story we in the West generally know little about. Watching this video biography won't make you an expert on Peter the Great, but it will certainly enlighten you as to the man's great historical importance and better acquaint you with the seemingly innate ambivalence in Russian society between traditional self-dependency and western-influenced modernization.",1139788800,37,4450,4.928

8085742,4,B000BF0CN4,"Chronicles the life of Russian leader whose father died when he was young and he spent time learning the family trade of monarch leadership by participating in activities (late1600's to early 1700's until he became national leader. He took a trip to Europe and discovered the advancements in information and technology and realized how far behind the times his own country was. He returned home and aspired to modernize the traditions, though he was opposed to the freedoms of the West. Violence was the method of getting rid of potential competitors and/or banishment to convents in cases of females.

He resorted to war tactics to get access to ports and shipping. He had a son who he mostly dismissed until he became a potential threat as he was seduced by those who may like to see a change in governance. While Peter modernized Russia he left a lot of heartbreak in his wake. Look how far Russia is behind modern times now. What price...victory?

8085743,1,B000BF0CN4,We bought this for our school primarily because it was closed captioned.  (We have students who are hearing impaired.) In the description this DVD is identified as closed captioned.  It is NOT.  This is a deal-breaker for us.  Will be returning.,1474502400,,245,4.902439024390244

8085745,1,B000BF0CN4,This DVD was definitely not worth the money.  It is extremely short and very poorly done.  I was very disappointed.,1398556800,,115,4.7
8085746,5,B000BF0CN4,"I love this series of Biography specials for my history classes. They're high quality and really engaging for my high school history class (who are otherwise fairly bored by documentaries)  There's usually enough strange fascinating info included to keep them engaged. They were horrified to find out about Peter having his own son tortured and killed.  While the scandals are sometimes overblown enough to be less academic than I'd like, they're perfect for getting HS History classes into history.  I wish they weren't so hard to find anymore!",1388102400,3,545,5.170454545454546
8085747,5,B000BF0CN4,"This is a Christmas present but the purchase of this book was inspired by this same book being purchase by my spouse on his kindle. He repeatedly told me parts from the story and we were both interested because we visited St Petersburg, Russia earlier this year and were impressed by the many stories and facilities associated with Peter the Great.",1384992000,,348,4.721311475409836
8085748,2,B000BF0CN4,Was hoping for a video to supplement European History curriculum for high school students -- too little substantive information and I ended up only showing a very brief portion of this video about Peter's difficult relationship with his son,1356825600,,240,5.17948717948718
8085749,3,B000BF0CN4,"This is a rather decent video, which gives some general ideas about the original personality of this outstanding Russian emperor, his biography and the epoch. It is good for students and for demonstrating during one of Russian Culture classes (History or Literature) as well as for watching at home for those who are interested in Russian culture. The only visible shortcoming of this film is frequent use of different kind of illustrations not related to Peter the Great times, which though could be explained by shortage of available pictures, prints, applied art objects, etc. This, unfortunately, creates some impression of sloppy selection of illustrating materials.",1287100800,3,671,5.4
8085750,5,B000BF0CN4,"The product was in totally perfect condition.
Peter Romanov was a fascinating man: compassionate, brutal. Energetic, creative and destructive. It's hard to classify him in any one category. This is a good reason why I love history so much (as well as teach it!) History is vastly more interesting and often more bizarre than anything in fiction!",1269129600,2,345,5.0701754385964914
8085751,4,B000BF0CN4,"It is a splendid and very informative Docu-drama.

But I think, it is not acceptable anymore that this kind of cultural pearls of European making, are only available for people in America and Canada.

I have been forced to do illegal things, in order to be able to see it, and I have to write the subtitles myself!

This very frustrating and onjust policy with region-codes, simply must change.

Kind regards,
