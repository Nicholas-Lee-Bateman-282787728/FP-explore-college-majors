3730583,5,B001OMZYE0,"There is not really much to say about the series. If you ever want a Artificial Hilarious High watch this show. It is very hilarious from episode one and thats what kept me hooked throughout the whole series. The series ending is kinda meh but it's humor doesn't slow down. Basically the Story is around this 10 year old girl who managed to Graduate from MIT and decided to Teach in A Japanese high school as a teacher. she also has this weird bunny, thing, That keeps getting Abused 24/7 in the whole show. The Girls in the class are mainly the generic smart girl but has a gigantic forehead, Mentally Derranged woman who can't stop thinking about King Crab and keeps spewing out the word ""Mahou"" or something like that while loving on the teacher too much. Normal kid who gets picked on for being normal. A girl conviently named 6 for some reason who is quite generous. Green haired girl who works at some chineese resturant and loves to scare The teacher to death, and last but not least, the Class President Ichijo. Ichijo is about the most random person you can ever think up. Along with her sister she instantly becomes my favorite charater of the whole show.

There's also aliens that Watch over The whole thing and they have pretty good skits.

Side charaters are also well written to like God AKA that Weird cat in the Vending machine, The other teachers, Etc.

Watch it. You will love it if your Into random hilariousness or if your inner child never dies for some reason.",1253059200,,1482,4.522388059701493
3730584,4,B001OMZYE0,"Buying this set is the smartest choice to see entire ""Paniponi Dash!"" TV series, absolutely.
The price you have to pay par one episode is only $2.42, and I strongly think you'll enjoy seeing!

But, this set has no extras such as clean-close OP/ED, and, I guess it is the most important thing, it lacks the new OVA episode released as the bonus of the Japanese edition of this set on April 15, 2009.

Amazon.co.jp says the Japanese edition costs you JPY 21,756, about $220.00, excluding the shipping fee.

3730587,5,B001OMZYE0,"the tagline of this anime got me interested enough to watch an episode or two off netflix and after that i was hooked. i'm 22 and this anime makes me laugh every few minutes. it's a little random and odd but the humor is the kind that as long as your inner child isn't dead you'll love this show.

while i was really hoping the dvds would have captions for the random insane things written on the blackboard durring the show. it doesn't, but it captions nearly everything else which adds alot to the humor.

if your a fan of mahoromatic or tenchi this stuff is in the same vein. very funny and i'd recomend it to anyone who happens to be looking at it because you probvably are the kind of person to enjoy it.

the poor reviews being based on no extra features are pure bull, these people are complaining that all they got when they bought the dvds was the show... thats lame, the show is great so just watch it and be happy you got it.",1238371200,15,936,4.188888888888889

I've Netflixed the original DVDs which have all the textless openings and closings and a bunch of other stuff. This set has the episodes and nothing else.

I do love the series and had been looking forward to getting this set.

3730600,2,B001OMZYE0,"I became an anime fan a couple years ago, after watching shows like Fairy Tail, Girls Bravo, Soul Eater, and Moon Phase
on Netflix. After exhausting their library, I began buying shows on Amazon when I had nothing else to watch, using the
online reviews and ratings available here. I generally buy two or three at a time, including one comedy and one action/
adventure title. Some of these have been swings in the dark, but for the most part, I haven't been disappointed too often.

Until now. I don't think I've ever regretted spending ten hours more than I did in watching Paniponi Dash! I expected
something along the lines of Negima!, which I enjoyed very much. Comparisons between the two shows seem natural
and inevitable: kid teacher with a classroom full of off-the-wall students. But in every way, PPD falls short. It is Negima!
without any of the latter's charm and wit. Instead of a teacher mature beyond his years, PPD has a girl who seems about
half her own age, more like a spoiled kindergartener than an MIT grad. Instead of 31 students each with individual
personalities, as Negima! has, PPD focuses on half a dozen students and ignores the rest, even to drawing them as
blank files, or giving them all the same face. Irritating.

Humor in what I assumed was supposed to be a comedy show is all but nonexistent, with the same feeble jokes done
over and over (and over).

So why did I give the show two stars instead of just one if I disliked it so much? I save one-star ratings for things that
are vulgar or intentionally offensive, which PPD is not. It's just lame, which isn't a crime, unfortunately.

Oh, wait. Some people consider animal abuse to be offensive, so change that rating to one-and-one-half stars.

Seriously, don't waste your time and money on this one.",1429315200,,1786,4.639240506329114

3730603,5,B001OMZYE0,"Well I'm certain not most will enjoy it if they aren't familiar with anime, for those who love comedy, randomness and good references then this is probably better than most anime you'll watch if comedy is at question.

It lasted so little, but did so much. It had a different credits every episode, very innovative for an anime since most usually don't do that at all.

My only complaint is the episode count, it was DEFINITELY worthy of a fifty-two episode run. Unfortunately, it only garnered half of that but still is better than the much more common twelve episode run most get, and with the manga lasting as long as it did, this show could easily be renewed one more time, to achieve that last twenty-six set of episodes, fingers crossed for 2015.

It'd even fit with the show's mood if they did another season TEN YEARS later in 2015, they'd get more respect than any other anime if they stayed devout for such a long time. And it would fit alongside the show's delivery of constant randomness. One season in 2005, then one in 2015, definitely feels like something they'd do too.

But yeah, highly recommend it for lovers of anime comedy, of which this series is the very pinnacle of. It even breached a new genre of comedy that has been followed with most comedy anime since. It's a cult classic, suffering only in its episode count, but not at all in its delivery.",1413072000,,1372,4.5425101214574894

3730607,5,B001OMZYE0,"There is so much to say about this show. It takes so much and packs it into one show like a cartoon on crack. It gets so many of the stereotypical points from manga, anime, and Japanese culture and mixes them with a bit of American caffeinated overtones. It also makes fun of what many have come to expect from different character type-casts we find in many of our favorite past manga or anime.

The best things about this anime are the animation and comedy. It's extremely strange, so don't try to understand it. Just get past the first 5 episodes and enjoy all of the goofiness that comes. If you can get a close up picture of the cover; then you can get a get a good idea of how Paniponi is drawn. The color shading and character designs are very unique and cool. There are also some pretty good voice talents in this one. It's not one of the better animes I've seen, but it's definitely funny and good mindless entertainment.",1350432000,2,771,4.429577464788732
3730614,5,B001OMZYE0,"When I grew up, I was amazed by Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the way one of its skits could stop on a dime and swerve into a new direction in moment's notice.  I loved the manic style of the show.  I'm bringing that up because I'd describe Pani Poni Dash the same way.  The premise is only a framework, and each episode unfolds in its own illogical, rapid-fire way.  I LOVE this series.

However, I admit that it's not for everybody.  A lot of its jokes rely on a knowledge of classic anime, Japanese TV series, and video games that, at least in Japan, are popular.  Since I am geek enough to have that kind of knowledge, it doesn't bother me in the least.  However, I also am realistic enough to know that to someone who is a casual anime watcher, most of its visual jokes may come across as static confusion, and may be disappointed with this series.

So, I'd recommend this series with the warning that if you don't know about series like Vampire Knight, or watched many Maho Shoujo series, you should hold off until you embrace your inner Otaku.",1337990400,4,1054,4.391752577319588

3730617,4,B001OMZYE0,"Pani Poni Dash was an anime filled with quirkiness, starting with Becky, a prepubescent high school teacher.  For example, Becky illustrates her passage to adulthood by downing an entire aluminum can of Boca-Bola(c) in one sitting.  At one point in the show most of the students sitting in their seats were zoo animals.  In conclusion, the anime is complete nonsense, which makes it so funny.  With so much quick and subtle comedy (in the original Japanese), I am VERY impressed with the translation, which must have been very difficult.

3730619,1,B001OMZYE0,This is easily one of the funniest series I've seen but this is not a good release.  Everyone I've talked to who owns this has mentioned that Disc 3 doesn't work in their DVD player.  I tried it out with my copy and had the same issue.  A DVD release that doesn't actually play in DVD players is about as bad as it gets.

In fact, it is a good place to start when getting into the off-kelter collection of animation team shaft; sure the mangaka is the one that makes the series zany due to source material, but the animators and the editors can often change a lot of that. But, here you get great odd-ball characters and gags that have become a staple of any series shaft creates. A depressed rabbit, a cat that is god, an elementary aged super genius teacher, all kinds of students populate this series and makes it very enjoyable.

3730621,3,B001OMZYE0,"Trying a new review format. ""Ratings"" are a guess on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: School Comedy

Situations:  Probably PG+  somewhat morbid visuals
Language:  Probably PG+
Nudity:  Probably R?
Violence:  Probably PG  Cartoon violence

Language options: Dub, Sub no Dub with subtitles. Worse: Default is Dub with MINIMAL subtitles (there's a lot of written signs and such in the background).

Special Features: This is a S.A.V.E. release, most features have been stripped. Unfortunately in this case Liner's notes are almost a necessity for us non-Otaku types who miss most of the jokes in the background because we don't know every manga and anime ever written....

First: Without explanation of the references to cultural, manga and anime that are constant in this show, unless you are very knowledgable n these areas, skip the SAVE version and find a version with liner's notes. That aside, even without, it's still a pretty good series.

Too many characters to develop all of them well, but it makes a good try at it. The main characters are well done though. The ""stage crew"" getting ""caught on camera"" is a running joke in the series that's amusing. The last episode being basically filler to fill time is a little disappointing.

I could run on with reasons it wasn't the hit Negima! was, but I don't want to make it seem all bad. It's actually a pretty good story. Characters are unique, and often strange. (I mean that in a good way). The story goes off on tangents, but that keeps it interesting. While it won't end up on a list of my top ten favorite animes, it's worth watching and worth watching again to catch some of what you missed the first time. Many areas are above average, but sometimes the potential for great is missed, so I'd call it average and entertaining.",1291939200,12,1782,4.784313725490196

3730625,4,B001OMZYE0,"Basically Paniponi Dash is a little like Azumanga Daioh in some ways. It's a comedic school/slice of life series focusing on the many characters in Beckys class and the way they interact with her and one another.

Becky is a little 11 year old girl teaching a class of unique, mostly hyperactive, and well lively students. Each episode is more self contained with the class getting into situations. Or situations quite frankly coming to them.

Some episodes focus on the students in her class. Some are more in the fantasy zone as in one episode they took elements out of Japanese history and ran with it for the whole episode.

Mesousa is a depressed talking rabbit that randomly gets into weird and unique situations, when he's happy something ultimately comes along and makes him depressed again.

All in all its a funny yet light hearted show.

3730628,3,B001OMZYE0,"This isn't a horrible series, but there really isn't anything special about it either. It's an anime comedy and if it differs from other anime comedies in any way it's only in how spastic the series is. If they made an anime for people can't pay attention this would be it! It's like Family Guy (which I love) in that the scene changes every thirty second, except here there are no cool clips with jokes to go along with the changes. But to be fair this anime is probably intended for 12 to 17 year olds (regardless of the rating) so I can't be to mad that the show misses with someone in there late twenties (me). I was hoping for ""School Rumble"" and got stiffed, but if you enjoy comedies with no overall story or plot this is for you. You could honestly start watching the series beginning with any episode at random and you'd be good to go. Paniponi Dash is a good buy if your just looking to get an anime fix, but if you want substance look elsewhere. P.S.

8330863,2,B001OMZYE0,"I am an anime/manga nut and this type of show hits my sweet spot for what I love about Japanese anime. However, it was clear from the first episode that this show was not good. The two biggest problems were the characters and the humor (which is about all there is).

First, the characters - nearly all of the main characters seem to revel in bullying each other. The off-the-wall anime shows that do this type of comedy well usually balance the humor with human elements so that you can grow to like the main characters during your time watching the show. From the start, it was clear that none of the main characters were interested in growing and their interactions with all the other characters nearly always involved bullying them in some way. I also couldn't get behind these characters because they were beyond illogical in their actions and the addition of space aliens and super-powered children only served to confuse the plot lines rather than make them funny. I love off-the-wall humor but because the set-ups for the jokes were so poorly done, I didn't find much humor in the show. (Perhaps watching the subtitled version would have helped. Unfortunately, I had to watch the dubbed version and I'm wondering if some of the humor was changed to accommodate English speakers.) They also didn't seem to know what kind of show they wanted to make. They constantly broke the fourth wall, moved between outer space and the classroom, and never gave any explanation for some of their choices. (Why make the main character a ten year old teacher? You could swap her out for a character of normal age and it wouldn't change the plot in any way except perhaps she wouldn't have gotten bullied quite so much.)

The other problem I had with the show was the humor. Slapstick humor is great when it's done well. A show with a clear comparison is Nichijou (Everyday). Both Nichijou and PaniPoni Dash have young, genius main characters. Both have school girls. Both have oddball side characters. Yet Nichijou was a much better show and I think the reason was that the humor was incorporated into the characters' everyday lives - that's just how they are all the time. Whereas the humor in PaniPoni Dash felt forced. It seemed as though they were trying to make unfunny characters into funny characters by throwing them into unbelievable situations and by adding some truly oddball characters and space aliens. (It reminds me of the Magical Mystery film by the Beatles - let's take a bunch of odd characters, throw them in a bus, drive around and film what happens.) The animators and writers seemed to have a similar mindset but, like Magical Mystery Tour, nothing very interesting happened with their characters. Finally, all good comedy shows usually also have some poignant, heartfelt moments that endear you to the characters and make you like them despite their humorous antics. There was none of that in PaniPoni Dash and the characters got more unlikeable as the show went along.

As I said before, a similar show that is much better written and much, MUCH funnier, is Nichijou. That is a better show, in my opinion and contains characters that you can actually get behind and jokes that are off-the-wall but still make sense within the overall plot. PaniPoni Dash is just a mess by comparison.",1442793600,,3299,4.774080560420315
