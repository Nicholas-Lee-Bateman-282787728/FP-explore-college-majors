1731134,1,B0000694YT,"Barring a few scenes, this is virtually a remake of George Romero's ""Day Of The Dead"", which came out 3 years before. Some of the scenes near the end of the film when the zombies predictably have ""taken over"", I found myself laughing more than cringing; suddenly, the zombies have turned into the living dead equivalent of Bruce Lee and become excellent fistfighters! Some also literally leap up from out of nowhere, such as from haybales, underground bunkers, etc. To me, the very last scene takes the cake for total absurdness...the hip and cool radio DJ ""Blueheart"" (who himself has turned into a zombie, incidentally) proceeds to play a song for ""all the undead all over the world""...how ridiculous!
It's said that director Lucio Fulci bowed out of this film either a) due to his declining health b) that he disliked the project. c) all of the above. The latter is probably the most accurate in this case. The liner notes were just about as funny to me as the movie; they go into detail as to how much ""restoration"" went into this DVD; using Italian negatives, restoring a ""missing"" scene that was only available on a Japanese version VHS video, and so forth.
One thing is certain...all of the restoration in the world won't save a bad film.",1036368000,,1245,4.689497716894977
1731135,2,B0000694YT,"For some reason, the name Lucio Fulci makes me buy many and many a movie. Its something of an addiction really, one that I sometimes love (as with Zombie and House by the Cemetery), sometimes question (as with the movie New Gladiators), and sometimes sigh at as the accumulation gods force me to buy. This movie is one of the latter times, something to throw into that questionmark-bearing rollercoaster ride, with loops and curves hitting various highs and lows that can either evoke startled jumps and enamored looks as gore flashes across the screen or assails with yawns and frowns as the movie makes less and less sense. Then there's also the issue of the movie suddenly deciding to forego that somewhat overrated idea many call a plot altogether and bumble around to keep some characters alive.
  Its hard to fault Lucio for this problem, though, because he did pull out of the creation of this film before its completion after some storyline disagreements. In fact, the movie had to be finished by someone else altogether, and I had often wondered what these motivational factors were. Well, here's what I discovered.
The beginning of the plot (the part that is coherent):
The movie starts out in the most conventional of fashions. Doctors trying to perfect a bioweapon simply known as Death 1 gruesomely perfect a virus that can animate the dead and decide that the army needs to come in and safely remove a sample of it. On the way to the helicopter, a van full of lab-coat clad terrorists with guns that mysteriously fire sometimes and only make popgun sounds at others, temporarily steal the virus away. It costs all these men save one their lives, however, and the survivor is off with a metallic briefcase full of virus, pursuers in tow that have guns that suffer the same fate as the terrorist's guns did, plus a helicopter added to the fray for good measure. In the ensuing chase some rounds are fired from the sky, the terrorist is hit and the case is dropped and the vial containing the virus is broken. Thus the infection begins.
  The terrorist stumbles to a hotel, acquires himself a room and starts making a mess right away. After chopping off his hand for some unexplained reason (the virus originally infected him there, but it was showing everywhere else as well), he kills a bit, awaiting the government's reaction that comes in a swift and brutal fashion. Then, in a Return of the Living Dead manner, the infected body is burned and the atmosphere is infected. Enter our main characters, three army men and a camper full of five individuals, who are accosted by a flock of infected birds and subsequently must stop at the now defunct hotel. Here, they begin to make discoveries, horrid ones, about the fate that has quickly begun to take over the town in the most undead of manners, losing some members of their swollen party in the process.
The plot thickens (hemorrhages, is spliced into a movie I somehow missed):
After the killing starts, the movie begins to bumble around. The characters separate and run into the supposed zombies; beasts that sometimes shamble and sometimes run, ones that can use weapons and that hide like amusements inside of a haunted house. They seem frightening enough at first, eating and goring anything in sight, until it is discovered that they have a bit of a flaw. They die really easily. Yes, these mawing machines have a resistance to the atypical sharp/blunt weaponry, but hot lead claws through their ranks o so easily. Well, the plot bumbles some more, a new female character is introduced, and then they ban together for the last half of the movie's plot; fleeing. Still, amidst the fleeing, many things happen that really don't seem to make sense. For instance, a cleanup crew of government men that have been ordered to kill everyone run into two of our main characters and basically get into fisticuffs with them instead of simply mowing them down. Later, when the survivors are trying to escape, one of them yells that they are out of shells and that they'll have to make a run for it. This isn't the case later, however, as his gun seems to replenish itself, making me wonder what has just transpired. (And the list goes on and on)
Basically, the beginning of the movie was really entertaining but, at the end, I couldn't fight back the yawning perplexion breeding in my head. If you want to see zombies with paper-thin resistance and some gore, I suppose you could watch it. Still, I'd advise you turn it off at the halfway marker.",1036281600,5,4504,4.719186785260483

It still works as an all-out, goof-ball, p.o.s. zombie flick that's so bad it's funny. Just don't go in expecting ""Day of the Dead"" ... Watch for the ""main"" scientist's spasticated body movements used to accentuate his nonexistent acting skills and the soldier's inability to react at people shooting at them. These I found particularly funny.",1035072000,9,518,4.8977272727272725
1731138,3,B0000694YT,"Hello Everyone,
 I'am a zombie movie fanatic.  i love all zombie movies, especially the Italian zombie films because they're much more gorier.  I was lucky enough to find this movie in a mama & papa store.  I don't think anyone will be able to find rent this movie on VHS unless you live in Europe or Italy.  Well anyway, this is a movie that equates itself to all the other Italian horror zombie movies such as Nightmare City, Hell of the Living Dead, Tombs of the Blind Dead, Zombie, the Beyond, City of the Living Dead, Zombie Holocaust, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, Burial Ground, and the George A. Romero's films.  Part of this movie was directed by LUCIO FULCI and the rest was directed by some other director.  Lucio Fulci withdrew from the film because he was dissatisfied with the film. In any case, this was a good film.  The only difference is that the zombies in this picture have alot of energy, they move about like regular humans.  The movie is not as gory as Lucio Fulci's Zombie film though.",1029024000,5,1005,4.50828729281768
1731142,3,B0000694YT,"I believe Fulci was sick and was unable to work much on the movie, and Mettei did most of the directing.

This film is fun, corny, extremely gory, and terribly rips off some direct scenes from movies like Return of the living dead.

Yet still, I find this a guilty pleasure and recommend it to zombie fans for sure.

If you are a fan of newer zombie material you may not like this

flick, but if you're familiar with Italian zombie 80's genre,

you may like this film.

Just don't go past part 3, cuz 4 and 5 are TERRIBLE.

4 is watchable at least, but 5 was unbelievably bad and no longer a part of the series it felt like.

Honestly though none of these films are related. Zombi2 was a italian ""sequel"" to dawn and 3 already has nothing to do with Fulci's classic.",1400544000,,766,4.198630136986301
1731143,5,B0000694YT,"Let me start off by saying Lucio Fulci was a master not only of horror, but of cinema in general. He had such films under his belt as ""The New York Ripper,"" and the infamously notorious ""Don't Torture a Duckling,"" but the one movie everyone remembers him for is ""Zombie,"" aka ""Zombi 2,"" as it was marketed (albeit misguidedly) as a direct sequel to George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" in Italy, where THAT film was simply entitled ""Zombi."" ""Zombi 2,"" or, as I will refer to it from here on out, ""Zombie"" was, as I've said, the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" of zombie movies. There are things in that movie up on the screen that can't possibly be there, but they are. It's a masterpiece, so naturally, Fulci wanted to do a sequel to ""Zombie,"" which, as the stories go, he worked on writing and drafting and coming up with ideas for for a 'true' sequel. It took almost ten years, but ""Zombie 2"" finally got underway. To avoid further confusion, when the final product was released, it was released as ""Zombi 3"" because most people already thought of ""Zombie"" as ""Zombi 2,"" even though ""Zombi 3"" is really ""Zombie 2."" Got it? Yes? Good. No? Too bad.

Next up, a little background on the movie: Fulci had a lot of time to prep for this, and it was going 'really well' as he put it until he fell very ill with debilitating stomach pains and an on-set doctor ordered him to seek medical attention immediately. Fulci had finished a significant portion of the film, varying reports will say he had shot forty percent of the movie, others say he finished almost ninety percent. The truth is probably that he filmed about seventy five percent of the finished product which you will see on this lovingly restored DVD from Shriek Show, who have done their best to rebuild Fulci's vision of a 'true' sequel to ""Zombie""/""Zombi 2."" The director's chair was reluctantly handed over by Fulci to a fellow renowned Italian director by the name of Bruno Mattei, who at the time was sort of the Italian equivalent to my America's own Michael Bay. Mattei completed the film as best as he could, but the finished product wound up a mess-- but not necessarily in a bad way. Many of the zombies in the movie are the slow shambling, flesh-eating ""Romero-esque"" zombies that Fulci had shown in ""Zombie""/""Zombi 2"" nine years earlier, but it's obvious that Bruno Mattei tried to implement his own, preferred 'strain' of zombies, which are fast, fairly intelligent tool-users who simply stab people or engage in otherwise ritually quasi-cannibalistic homicidal behavior. The finished product is like a game of Pong played between Fulci and Mattei and in this watcher's opinion, it's a beautiful mishmash of fun zombie excitement and a flawed masterpiece.

The movie's plot is simple by zombie movie standards: scientists hired by the military work on a chemical/virus/parasite/nanotechnology/science that reanimated corpses in hopes of both curing death and creating super soldiers. As you can expect, things go South pretty quickly, somebody gets bitten, runs amok and starts a zombie outbreak in the Philippine islands and it's up to some rowdy youths to try to save the day only for them to get systematically picked off one by one by our flesh eating friends from Hell. That's it, that's the essentially the movie. But if you were to watch it after watching two very specific other movies, you might see what Fulci was trying to do for the majority of his time working on the film. The movies in question you should watch immediately prior to watching ""Zombi 3"" are George Romero's 1985 classic ""Day of the Dead"" and a comedy-horror movie from the same year written by George Romero's friend and colleague John Russo, called ""Return of the Living Dead."" The question on the tip of your lips right now is probably: ""What's the connection between George Romero, John Russo and Lucio Fulci, apart from zombies?"" Well, this is my little take on it. When ""Zombie""/""Zombi 2"" was released, the distribution companies were dead-set (no pun intended) on marketing it as a sequel to Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" a movie which was a direct sequel to the 1968 Godfather of Zombie movies ""Night of the Living Dead"" which was co-written by John Russo who later made ""Return of the Living Dead"" which was loosely based on a novel he'd written that he'd intended as his own sequel to ""Night.""

I know this is a little hard to follow, but let me explain, further: ""Day of the Dead,"" like many of Romero's movies, is an allegory story. In the case of ""Day,"" its two main themes are fascism and Science Versus Faith, ironically in ""Day"" faith is represented by the scientists and science is represented by the military. But the fact that ""Day"" was about a clash of science versus faith, in particular the themes of the scientists trying to understand the zombie plague, Fulci probably was still stewing about the way they recut his ""Zombie"" and made it ""Zombi 2"" and tried to implement Romero's  completely unrelated elements to it through poorly guided marketing and thus when it finally came time for ""Zombie 2"" which would inevitably be released as ""Zombi 3,"" Fulci decided to do an almost satirical take on Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" by having the movie's main theme be science versus the military. This is not an accident or coincidence. I can say that I do know that Fulci wasn't spiting George Romero, but rather the distributors who tried to make it seem like HE was Romero and that there was no difference in continuity between his film and Romero's films. So now Fulci had a grand chance to mess with people on a whole new level, and he took it and held on to it for as long as he could until he fell ill. But the satirical take on Romero's films doesn't end there.

In ""Zombi 3"" the main zombie outbreak begins when they capture ""patient zero,"" who has been zombified, the military kills the zombie and cremates it, its ashes go up the chimney and spread through the Philippines, settle in the water and turn the residents of a nearby town into psychopathic flesh eaters. This is virtually identical to the way the zombie outbreak began in the film version of John Russo's ""Return of the Living Dead,"" when Clu Gulager, James Karen, Don Calfa and Thom Matthews are in a morgue and they cremate a live zombie because they can't figure out how to kill it, inadvertently sending the ashes of Trioxin 321 into the air and raising the dead in a nearby cemetery after a heavy rainfall. This is Fulci giving the finger to the distributors on an extremely subtle level, as John Russo always had different ideas than George Romero's regarding the end of ""Night of the Living Dead."" Whereas George figured a zombie uprising would mean the collapse of society, John figured we could get it under control if we didn't panic, which was essentially the subject of the novel he wrote upon which the movie ""Return of the Living Dead"" is (again, very loosely) based. So this movie (""Zombi 3"") is a sequel to a movie that is NOT a sequel but was marketed as a sequel to a movie that WAS a sequel and satirizes both the sequel's basis and a film based on a book made by the sequel's predecessor marketed as a sequel to the original black and white movie. So now, layers within layers, you've got a crazy Italian director who's not as much angry as he is miffed about the retitling of his movie and the confusion as to who made it and if it's a sequel to something or not and he's doing the best he can at this point not only to confuse you but to try and make the people at the distribution companies' heads explode.

As for the film, I loved it. Check it out. It's cheap and it comes in a nice DVD case with gorgeous artwork. There's an odd plentitude of special features for this one, including a tongue in cheek commentary by the two main stars of the film! This is also a restored cut, pieced painstakingly back together after years of being torn apart by censors or distribution companies or studios, this 96 minute cut features every single bit of the movie there is excluding not one second of anything shot that was meant to be in the final product. So not only do you get a cool zombie movie, you get the uncut, original version of the movie. ""Zombi 3,"" or as I like to call it ""Zombie 2"" was followed by two 'official' unofficial sequels, the fantastically painfully 80s ""Zombie 4: After Death"" (""Zombie 3,"" to me.) and ""Killing Birds: Zombie 5"" (""Zombie 4,"" to me.) both of which are ridiculous as anything, but again, fun to watch. So, long story short, this movie is a satirical take on the zombie movie making process done by Italian cinema master Lucio Fulci towards the end of his life. He would later disown the film for the most part, but he always remained proud of the ""flying head"" scene. And, I'll admit-- it's a fantastic scene. But if you wanna see it, you gotta get the movie-- and what a gift! This movie will give you a lot of bang for your buck. Enjoy!",1392249600,7,8920,4.5823418910457105

There is nothing at all to watch in this film, I like zombie films just like the other guy but this is boring.

Obviously, since this is an Italian horror, I'm not expecting the next 'Silence of the Lambs', but I truely felt that this lacked quite a bit of effort in the writing and directing. I'm aware that Fulci wasn't dedicated to the movie, but I'm kind of shocked he even put his name on it. To go from some of the most original and exciting special effects in the industry to nothing but tattered cloths and some blue-grey makeup is pretty lame. So if you've seen every other Zombie flick, go for it. Otherwise, if you aren't into Italian low budget horrors, just give this one a pass.",1367712000,,747,4.381294964028777

1731147,5,B0000694YT,"......the commentary track.

It's Beatrice Ring and Deran Safarian. Deran is on a role from beginning to end in this thing. A few moments of silence here and there, but he turns this film into comedy gold, and I'd say it was honestly funnier than MST3K/Rifftrax, for a guy who doesn't do that line of work. Comments about cast members being used by Fulci's talents, removing clothing because they have a Van Damme physique, too jokes about Fillipino men masquerading as US soldiers. Commentary as to the ridiculous things people do, to a finale where he does his own dubbing on the scene with the scientist discussing Death One to the colonel.
If the film made you laugh at all, the commentary will have you rolling. Even Beatrice couldn't stop laughing at everything Daren had to say, and neither could I.
Was this film trash? 100%! However, does it fill the void to be entertained? Another 100%. I actually had owned this for 3 years before finally watching it again, and I accidentally switched to the commentary, and once I did, this dvd definitely became a MUST KEEP and MUST VIEW YEARLY!

1731151,4,B0000694YT,"In many ways Zombie 3 can be seen as the end of an era; around this time the tide was starting to turn against horror and Italian horror cinema was reaching the end of the high point of its popularity.

Zombie 3 is also one of the last movies by Lucio Fulci that gained a large cult following, while Fulci would go and make 7 more movies, some of which have gained a following I would say Zombie 3 is the more well known among Fulci fans.

Zombie 3 is probably one of Lucio Fulci's lesser efforts; even in some of his weaker films, Lucio Fulci was able to build some tension and atmosphere and sometimes make a movie creepier than it should have been, where as other times he was able to do that, but unable to sustain it.

This time around there really isn't anything Fulci about the movie; apparently at the time he was sick and I think that shows. Honestly there is nothing Fulci about this movie at all. Lucio Fulci had a certain style. When you watch a Fulci movie good or bad you know its Fulci. Even though about half the movie was shot by Bruno Mattei, the scenes that were done by Fulci bare no resemblance to his past work. The visual style Fulci was so known for isn't seen at all here.

Claudio Fragasso wrote the script along with his wife Rossella Drudi who was un-credited. According to Fragasso, Fulci was dumping pages he said were too complex too shoot. Based on some other interviews with Fragasso he normally has an excuse on why his movies come out so poor.

True or not the script is obviously weak so it really doesn't matter if what Claudio Fragasso is true or not.

The funny thing is Fragasso and Rossella Drudi actually have a hint of a plot a clichd one, but a plot nonetheless, the movie also attempts some social commentary, but the movie is so poorly written all this is lost and it comes out really silly.

After the movie was shot it ran at 70-min and was said to be too slow. The movie was chopped down to 50-min and Fulci refused to do any reshoots.

So in comes in Bruno Mattei who finished the movie along with Claudio Fragasso. Quite honestly this is probably Mattei's best work, which really isn't saying much. Make no mistake Zombie 3 is a bad movie, but that is why I love it.

The characters are idiots who say the dumbest things, but yet I loved every second of the movie. As for the zombies they range from slow moving to rather fast. Some zombies have a few lines and others are silent.

The highlight for me was the zombie with the machete I found that scene hysterical. We also have a very funny scene with a flying zombie head, now that was classic. And we even have zombie birds. I love how different the zombies are. As I said one minute they are really slow and weak the next fast and strong. Neither Fulci nor Mattei stuck to anything with the zombies.

The gore is fairly decent; it's not the gorefest like some of Fulci's prior work, but Zombie 3 has some decent gore, but could have used a bit more. But gore-hounds should be pleased.

Zombie 3 very much is the so bad its good movie. It's idiotic and poorly done, but a blast to watch. Though I will say if you are new to Lucio Fulci I would recommend working your way up to Zombie 3. In my opinion this movie doesn't show Lucio Fulci is about. While yes his movies do have their flaws, but he's a much better director than what he shows here.

For those interested in buying this movie I would recommend getting the Zombie Pack. The set includes Zombie 3, Zombie 4: After Death & Zombie 5: Killing Birds. The set is cheaper than any of the movies solo.

The information here on Amazon is wrong, Zombie 3 is Un-rated and not R-Rated, also the aspect ratio is actually 1.85:1 and not 1.33:1.",1178236800,2,3696,4.291666666666667

1731158,3,B0000694YT,"""Zombi 3"" (1988), also known as ""Zombie Flesh Eaters 2"", also known as ""The Beyond"", not to be confused with the 1981 movie called ""The Beyond"" which is also known as ""E tu vivrai nel terrore - L'aldil"".  ""Zombi 3"" was a follow-up to ""Zombi 2"" (which was called simply ""Zombie"" in Italy), an unofficial sequel to ""Dawn of the Dead"" directed by Lucio Fulci.  Confused?

Briefly, here is the plot of ""Zombi 3"".  A government's experimental chemical is stolen.  The chemical infects people with a contagion that turns people into flesh eating zombies.  This variety of Zombie has mild speech, strength, and move relatively quickly.

I was surprised when I found out that this is a Fulci film.  I really enjoy many of his films, such as ""Don't Torture a Duckling"", ""City of the Living Dead"", and ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin"".  All wonderful (and disgusting) horror movies.  ""Zombie"" three was made almost 15 years after some of those films, and it is terrible.  The acting (really bad voice-overs) is abysmal.  The effects look like something one could find in a high school student's film.  The plot is more tangled than last year's Christmas tree lights.  I like many bad horror movies, but I expected more from Fulci.  According to i.m.d.b., there were two additional directors on this film who are not credited.  I wonder what the story is with that, and if it explains what went wrong with this film.

On a positive note, if you like bad horror, then this is a movie for you.  I rank it above the an Ed Wood film or something you'd see in a Bci Eclipse ""10 zombie movies"" box set, but far below ""Dawn of the Dead"" or even ""Day of the Dead"".  Good for viewing if you're in a silly MST3K mood, or to have on in the background when friends are over.  Just don't get your hopes up, and you might enjoy this film.  It's not great, but I've seen much worse.",1131667200,,1852,4.46865671641791
1731159,4,B0000694YT,"What we have in Zombi 3 is a bludgeoning of predominantly bad acting, wacky storywriting, and a whole lot of unnecessary fog. So far, it has all the makings of a cool Italian gore flick.

The gore never really comes though. But somehow that's ok. There's enough in it that you're not entirely disappointed. Like the scene where a man rescues a girl from some water only to find out her legs have been chewed away.

This film is incredibly entertaining. The zombies sorta do whatever they want. We got shamblers, we got crazy machete-weilders, and we've even got zombie DJs at the end.

The thing is, you can either go into this expecting Dawn of the Dead or Zombi 2 caliber zombie film-making, or you can watch it and make ties to movies like Evil Dead 2 instead. If you do that, the movie instantly becomes better. You no longer care that a FLYING ZOMBIE HEAD just came out of the fridge to kill someone. You don't care that when one man has become a zombie, you are showed that he has made the final tranistion by him saying, ""Patricia, I'm thirsty.....FOR YOUR BLOOD!""

If you go into it expecting a fun romp instead of a clear cut zombie film, you'll be set. It's very entertaining as a fun romp. The first time I saw Zombi 3, I was very disappointed. But I gave it another try. And then another. And then I bought it. And watched it again. And I realized that I love this movie, despite all its flaws.

So yeah. If you're looking for serious zombie fare, Dawn of the Dead and Zombi 2 are where you should be going. But if you've come to accept that there's only 8 or 9, maybe 10 zombie movies that aren't incredibly, terribly cheesy, you should love Zombi 3.",1130803200,,1663,4.351612903225806
1731160,3,B0000694YT,"I don't have much of anything in particular to say about this film, other than that I think it gets a bad rap.  Maybe it's hurt by its lineage, as it is the pseudo-sequel to a genre classic, which was itself a pseudo-sequel to THE genre classic.  And yeah, 'Zombie 3' is not a good zombie film, but there are plenty worse.  As a matter of fact, it's actually more slick and professional than most  Italian zombie movies.  I think that may be part of the reason it's so disliked.  It's not nearly as good as the genuinely good zombie movies, but it's not cheap and hokey enough to work that well on a camp level.  Also, it isn't very gory and has some somewhat subpar zombie makeup, which is likely to destroy whatever other goodwill it may have received.  But I, for one, think this is an amusing, reasonably competent zombie film with a ton of zombie action in it.  Minute for minute, this movie has more zombies than just about any other one I can think of.  It does have some excessively silly stuff, like the killer fetus and the flying zombie head, but if you're just looking for a lot of zombie action, this ain't bad.  Most of it is at least passably entertaining, and the night assault by the zombies in the fog is quite cool, I think.  It is pretty damn pieced together, moving from one plot point to the next in an utterly random fashion, but what do you expect.  It's a zombie movie.

Anyway, check it out.  It's fun.

Anyway, I am reviewing the one by Lucio Fulci. I don't know why, but City Of The Living Dead (aka The Gates Of Hell) is one of my hidden guilty pleasure all time favorite film. So, I have a morbid curiosity about Fulci films. I do like The Beyond, even though my DVD is called ""The 7 Doors Of Death"" (confused yet?)

All I can say about Zombie 3 is, Fulci, what the heck happened? It is awful! The only thing I can say on a positive note is he can make the daylight look creepy in every film, and he did it in this one too...but man it bites!!

'Burial Ground' was loads better than this..I recommend that one instead.",1124496000,,733,4.184397163120567
1731164,2,B0000694YT,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""The Beyond,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Uncle Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a good director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography.

""Zombi 3"" takes place in the Philippines, of all places, and involves some sort of toxic spill at a secret laboratory which, not surprisingly, results in all sorts of zombies running about the place. How does the toxin, which goes by the name of Death One, enter the public domain? Well, a bunch of terrorists steal the plague, but one of them is infected in the process. The army kills this guy and burns his body in a crematorium. The ashes released into the atmosphere apparently carry the virus--or plague, toxin, bioweapon, whatever you want to call it--to the native population via a flock of birds. Oh, before that happens the infected terrorist checks into the Manila Holiday Inn and experiences a catastrophic meltdown in the bathroom, thus infecting a few of the hotel staff whose only crime consisted of showing up with fresh towels. By the time the military types start to burn the corpse of the infected terrorist, a scientist guilty of some of the worst acting in the world pops in to warn about destroying the body. Doing so, he claims, could turn the toxin into an airborne contagion. Or something like that; I don't quite remember because by this point in the film my groans had assumed such ear shattering intensity that it was difficult in the extreme to follow the narrative. As if there is a narrative!

Anyway, a bunch of soldiers quickly form a cordon around the town and blast anyone they run into in the hope that they can somehow contain the Death One virus. A few soldiers--Kenny (Deran Sarafian), Roger (Richard Raymond), and Bo (Massimo Vanni)--hook up with a carload of kids--Patricia (Beatrice Ring) and Carole (Marina Loi) among them--in an effort to survive the increasingly hungry waves of zombies. At least I think that's what happened. Sorry, but following the ins and outs of ""Zombi 3"" is a lot like trying to find signs of intelligence in Paris Hilton's latest television program. I can say that lots of gory munching takes place, a zombie head soars across a room at one point, and the undead in this movie can swim, run, walk really fast, and play the harmonica like you've never heard. Mattei/Fulci also throw in a bunch of low rent shoot 'em up scenes between the soldiers and everyone else that are noticeable only because of their abject cheapness. Don't expect any ""Godfather"" level squib work here--the bullet wounds in ""Zombi 3"" are barely above the old ""ketchup in palm of hand slapped over chest"" trick. One thing I really liked about the movie, though, is the disco jockey issuing reports about the unfolding madness. What a surprise what happened to him, eh? Oh brother!

The morass that is ""Zombi 3"" should not rest entirely on Fulci's shoulders, however. At some point in the production, the famed filmmaker dropped out of the project and turned the camera over to Bruno Mattei. This director, if you're not familiar with his work, ranks as one of the greatest schlock masters to ever grace the world of Italian filmmaking. According to interviews in the supplements section of the disc, Mattei claims that Fulci filmed most of the movie but refused to lens additional scenes deemed necessary to pad the feature out to a decent runtime. Magical Mattei thus stepped in to help out. God help us. The result is a movie so atrociously bad that it's actually a great addition to the sleazy zombie genre. Really. If you love zombie films like I love zombie films, ""Zombi 3"" is a must see if for no other reason than to understand how not to make a movie. It takes an enormous amount of work to craft a film this horrific, so hats off to Bruno Mattei for unleashing yet another mangled piece o' pulp on the world.

Considering the ""Zombi 3"" DVD comes to us from the friendly folks over at Media Blasters (through their Shriek Show label), expect more than a few extras. We get a trailer for the film. We also get a still gallery. And we get interviews with Mattei, scriptwriter Claudio Fragrasso, Marina Loi, Massimo Vanni, and Richard Raymond. On top of all that, Media Blasters throws in trailers for ""Buio Omega,"" ""House of Clocks,"" and ""Spasmo."" Fun stuff, even if the movie doesn't really deserve this much attention. Watch ""Zombi 3"" for the occasionally effective gore, and to see if you can figure out which scenes came from Fulci and which ones came from Mattei. Good luck!",1120867200,4,5540,4.644240570846075

There is a flying zombie head that flies out of a fridge. There is a man who plays a zombie, and when he steps out of a pond of water, his calves are bare, with no make-up on them. (Ooops, guess the masses missed that.) There are zombie birds. There is a zombie DJ. Etc...ect...And the menu to the DVD, has this horrible, yet awesome, 80's horror music. If that doesn't frighten you alone, there is something wrong with you. And this movie has multiple loop holes in the plot. For instance, the main characters find all these guns and stuff in an abondoned hotel, and the guy says ""We're gonna need these."" But yet, they don't know that there are zombies out. Just little things like that. But its those very things that make this movie so fun to watch with friends. But this movie is seriously crazy. The original director filmed something like 10 minutes of it, decided it was crap, and left. But if you like crazy B-movies with zombies, go for it dude.

Things I Learned From Zombi 3: Just because you decapitate a zombie, does not mean that it is dead and will not hurt you. Also, you do not need to put a zombie head into the fridge, because it does not need to be kept cold.

1731173,1,B0000694YT,"Where to begin describing this execrable film? Originally proposed as a big-budget 3-D feature, it degenerated into this final product.
Fulci was ill during the making of the film and Mattei and Fragasso stepped in to assist and complete it. The result is a terrible mess, similar to Mattei's brutally inept ""Hell of the Living Dead"". Reports vary regarding how much of the final product was Fulci's. I was able to identify only two scenes that looked like classic Fulci: a brief shot of backlit zombies standing around a bus (composition and lighting similar to ""City of the Living Dead"", and a female protagonist-become-zombie (make-up similar to Fulci's ""Zombie"", aka ""Zombie 2""). The remainder is a wretched piece of dreck lensed with a cheesy 80s vaseline-soft-focus look and the worst zombie make-up this side of your local drugstore.
The interviews, however, are worth the price of a rental: Fragasso and Mattei describe the scattergun way the movie ended up being assembled. Most interesting were the comments of the two stuntmen/actors in the last interview segment, who state that Fulci was so ill, he would describe the shots he wanted to them and let them set them up. This explains much! Unless you enjoy trying to figure out who-filmed-what, you will beg for 96 minutes of your life back after seeing the film itself.
Sime final thoughts regarding the particulars of the disk: Despite anamorphic enhancement, the disk is peculiarly grainy (like much of Media Blasters' output, I'm afraid). Some of the more graphic gore scenes have additional grain and washed-out colors with fuzzy edges, making me very suspicious that they came from a different video master (similar to Germany's ASTRO DVD, which often reinserts scenes from uncut Dutch VHS tapes into their heavily censored masters).

Overall, it is a poor film and derivative even by 'Living dead' movie standards (and that's saying something), but has some excellent moments which frustrate the viewer by indicating how good the film could have been. So what is good ?
1) The lush tropical setting, reminiscent of 'Contamination' and 'Day of the Dead'.
2) The guys in the white decontamination suits, reminiscent of 'The Crazies' (and 'Contamination').
3) The first machette-wielding zombie who attacks Beatrice Ring with real vigour (now that's what I call action and aggression).
4) The flying head (yes, it's stupid but a moment of gonzoid genius)
5) The moment when the blond soldier pulls the girl out of the pond (you'll have to see it yourself)
6) The soundtrack -which Amazon.com don't sell even though it is available, but be warned the soundtrack CD does not contain the most exciting bit of uptempo music from the film.
7) Beatrice Ring, who plays an annoying insipid character, but is cute.
What's bad ? The dialogue (is it badly translated or just very badly written), the dubbing (remember now that this is an Italian horror movie, so you should be prepared for this), the influence of 'Return of the Living Dead' and 'Day of the Dead' on the script and the fact that it was written by the guy who wrote 'hell of the Living Dead' (aka 'Zombie Creeping Flesh'). In fact, you could argue that 'Zombi 3' is a superior remake of the latter film. Finally, the silly DJ reminiscent of the DJ in 'Vanishing Point' whose dialogue belongs in a very poor seventies exploitation flick.
Now you're thinking 'he doesn't like it'. Wrong. This is a fun movie that all horror fans should enjoy: if you don't then you'll never understand what a missed opportunity is or how to have a good laugh at the more absurd moments in horror history...
Finally, the DVD quality. This 'Shriek Show' edition is very good, including as it does a 5 minute pre-credit introduction previously only available on Japanese versions. This extra material is taken from a 1"" video master (the only surving source|) so is low quality compared to the rest of the film, which looks great, much better than the UK edition. BUT several of the gore scenes seem to be lifted from a  similarly poor video master, which is unforgivable - the UK edition is better in this repsect. This is bizarre, as the Trailer (which included, and is as I've said one of the most exciting trailers I've ever seen) contains some of these scenes in a pristine transfer) , but overall the film looks miles better than other versions, despite the white haloes around many of the characters in bright scenes, presumably the result of poor lighting/shading control due to the low budget. Also included are trailers for other nasty Italian horrors like 'Beyond the Darkness'(which looks as perverse as you's expect) 'Spasmo' (which looks like a typically silly low quality giallo) and 'House of Clocks' (which just looks like garbage). The package is rounded off with 40 minutes of interviews with some of the stars, second unit director Bruno Mattei and screenwriter Claudio Fragrasso, all basically about Lucio Fulci, clearing up the issue of which bits of the film he directed (sadly no interview with Beatrice Ring) - basically, the 'Contamination' suited guys, the crap scientists and even stupider military men were pretty much all shot by Mattei, Fragrasso using elements of his own 'Zombie Creeping Flesh'/'Hell of the Living Dead' and 'Return of the Living Dead'. Perhaps a true Fulci cut, minus this stuff will emerge one day - it will only be about 50 minutes long, will need the gore scenes restored from a pristine source and contain a Beatrice Ring interview (plus new, more effectively written dialogue would be something) all in DTS sound.

The special effects are horrid and the zombies have to be infected with bipolar disorder along with that toxic disease.  Some run and some shamble, I guess it depends on what sort of mood your undead cadaver happens to be in.  The soundtrack is pretty cool, and it's not every day that you see a flying zombie head (great scene... horribly made... but still great).",1045267200,,466,4.435294117647059

1731180,3,B0000694YT,"For those who have not seen an Italian Zombie film, well you are missing out on some of the goriest movies out there.  Basically if one is interested in the idea than this is a good place to start.  This is actually a little tame (but still more extreme than most american films) but has enough gore to satisfy Gore hounds.
The idea behind this little piece of Art is that some scientist are developing a new chemical weapon.  When the chopper delivering to another military base is attacked, one of the hijackers is infected with the chemical.  He makes a run for it and ends up in a hotel.  With in a matter of hours he murders a maid and slowly each person killed becomes a Zombie.  Meanwhile some tourist and some military men on leave get caught in the quarenteen zone and will be killed by either the troops or zombies.
In the end Zombi 3 features the poor acting that so many italian zombie films feature, but plenty of gore.  Once again if you are weak of stomach, do not watch this movie.",1039824000,3,997,4.327956989247312

The film itself is just a mess but I admit I had fun watching it and it had decent parts (and a couple decent gore scenes). The disc is also very cool it has a neat shine to it that is pleasing to look at. It is also just a dub and not a great one but I doubt the Italian acting was much better. Do I recommend it?

 Zombi 3 is the second of director Lucio Fulcis Zombie series.  The first was called Zombi 2, a confusion which was caused by the release of a George Remero film in Italy as simply Zombi.  Actually, Fulci became ill during filming in the Philippines and the last 40% of the film was completed by director Bruno Mattei.  This may explain why the film exhibits even less coherence than the run of the grave Zombie movie.
 We can certainly give good grades to Zombi 3 for make up.  The Zombies look good, by that I mean hideous, decayed and Zombie like.  The acting is unfortunately of the usual vapid, low grade Zombie flick standard.  There is more of an action film flavor to this movie than usual.  Except for one nauseating sequence involving what may be the first Zombie live birth ever put on film, the gore is tame, though there is a lot of squirting blood at appropriate moments.  The victims do a lot of hand to hand combat with Zombies, which is sometimes successful.  Also, the Zombies seem to be able to be killed by ordinary bullets to the body or in a case or three, by penetration of the chest by knives or other pointy things.
 The plot involves a science experiment gone bad, this time master minded by the American army which somehow has jurisdiction over Philippine troops in that nation.  This is just one of several plot absurdities that the viewer has to contend with.
 American soldiers are made to look like disco dudes in fatigues.  For some reason they go on a pass to town with their side arms and encounter a bus load of youngsters.  The youngsters are out for a good time and the boys don't seem to mind sharing their excess girls with the three soldiers.
 Even the sound effects are well below what we can accept.  There is a flying Zombie head which has some entertainment value, even if it makes no sense.  I did like the attempts by the authorities to contain the outbreak which were logical but not effective.  We have Zombie birds, which again is logical.
 Zombi 3 grinds on for one hour and 36 minutes.  This should be R rated for gore, but surprising and disappointing in an Italian movie, not for nudity.  Even though this is an Italian studio production, the overall quality is so bad we can award it only a lowly one and half brains.  Avoid if possible. 1988",1425945600,,2304,4.4700239808153475

7965323,5,B0000694YT,"Much maligned follow-up to Zombie (or Zombi 2, Zombie Flesh Eaters, depending on your country) is actually a lot better than credited. Lucio Fulci was sick at the time and the film was completed by Bruno Mattei (Night of The Zombies, aka Hell of The Living Dead, Zombie Creeping Flesh). However, the film is in true Italian zombie style with lots of gore, bad dubbing, dodgy acting and electronic music. Zombi 3 still manages to be a lot more entertaining than the hordes of CGI nonsense like Resident Evil, 28 Days Later, World War Z etc. In fact, those films all stole ideas from the Italian movies without acknowledgement.

Interesting points- there is a black blind radio DJ broadcasting throughout and the main actor is Deran Sarafian, son of Richard Sarafian who directed Vanishing Point (1971), also featuring a black blind radio DJ. Did Deran have some script input here? Also, try and spot the crew member towards the end of the film, who leans out from behind a building with a smoke machine!!!

Shriek Show always do a great job on their DVDs- anamorphic 1.85 transfer, grainy in places but that's part of the Italian 'look'. Informative interviews with the cast and crew and trailers. A must for Italian trash fans.",1417219200,,1227,4.783018867924528
7965324,3,B0000694YT,"I can easily see why Bruno Mattei is so quick to say this is Lucio Fulci's film and not his.  The results speak for themselves.  But however much Mattei would like to distance himself from this mess, the blame for it clearly rests with him as he also admits that he directed all of the `filler' scenes with the military elements.  As the bulk of the film deals with those very elements, one wonders just how much of Fulci's original vision is still present in this chunky mass of destruction.  (Lucio Fulci tried unsuccessfully to have his name removed from the credits.)

As for the story, some dopey scientists create a serum called Death One, that can reanimate the dead.  It's a military project, no surprise, and naturally, the serum falls into the wrong hand, which is later cut off, to no avail, requiring head military goon General Morton (Mike Monty) to kill all the patrons and staff of the hotel the infected man was hiding in.  It's a botched effort to contain the problem.  To further aggravate the situation, this same stupid general has the infected man cremated, which allows his `infection' to be released into the air, infecting birds that attack and infect another person, continuing the cycle.

The acting is uniformly fraught with hysterics.  There's a lot of yelling and grand gestures.  No one `acts' like a normal person.  The situations are expected.  The zombies are basically generic.  Some of the set pieces are lost among the rumble and ruin (the zombie head that flies out of a refrigerator and the zombie newborn should have been showcased better).

I'm rather ambivalent about it; I don't hate it and I don't love it.  It's passable entertainment.

Lesson to learn; people dressed in hazmat outfits are not your friends (especially if they're carrying automatic weapons).",1412208000,,1803,4.839869281045751
7965325,1,B0000694YT,"An experimental drug/virus gets loose in the Philippines (?) as people and birds become infecting flesh eaters. There are various subplots involving tourists and the military. The feature has some camp value to it. The initial gun fight sequence was poorly  done and comical as people fire at each other at close range and some people with guns seem to be standing around. The bird attack was funny. The zombie makeup only covered the head and hands. The feet and legs were unaffected. The zombies are sometimes foot draggers, other times they can box and fight.  Head shots are not required to kill them. And oh yes some talk and think. Just a bad script.

Not worth viewing, even for zombie fans...unless you can't get enough of an 80's action sound track.

I like to think it's like a Fulci/Mattei mashup so it's great entertainment. So if you are looking for a serious zombie drama look somewhere else, if your looking for a off the wall entertaining zombie flick with action gore and cheese, look no further than zombi 3 directed by lucio fulci and bruno mattei!!!!",1406764800,3,599,4.3097345132743365
