8088491,5,B000BKVS46,"Duck Baker has a lot of videos like this one and it's ALWAYS easier to learn from him when you can see how he plays it. Using a book can be nice, but the learning curve is easily half when you can see him with the explanation regarding positioning and style.
  In particular this DVD is a great way to get involved in Brittish Isles folk as many of the fingerings are not so obvious. He makes it look very easy when he plays and that helps me build confidence, knowing that it's easy when you take the time to learn it.
  Fantastic video, bravo!",1231200000,,545,4.161904761904762
