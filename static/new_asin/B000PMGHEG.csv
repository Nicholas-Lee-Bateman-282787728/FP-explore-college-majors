8325619,5,B000PMGHEG,"I bought this for my wife who is recovering from an operation on a badly herniated disc. We reviewed the exercises with her physical therapist, and he said they were appropriate for her. She's been doing them faithfully for around a month now, starting slowly and gradually adding repetitions. The DVD also has general tips on how to do self-traction, stretching, etc. I'm no doctor or physical therapist, but it makes sense to me -- and more importantly, it's helping my wife get a workout, while slowly and carefully increasing the strength in her back and core. Try it! But of course review with your health care professional, to make sure the exercises are appropriate for you.",1194566400,5,681,4.829059829059829
8325620,3,B000PMGHEG,This DVD is good for someone who has never exercised in their life. It has some very good tips but again for someone who has never exercised. If you have been to physical therapy even once then you have covered all that is in this DVD. I was disappointed that there wasn't more information for the price. They have a nice explanation of the exercises.,1187568000,7,351,4.415384615384616
