8546172,5,B00A2F1NHM,I love this 80's Japanese cartoon because of the humor and love interest between one of the cat burglars and policemen. There is the humor throughout the show too. The music is fun as well as the action. This was typical Japanese anime of the 80's.,1388188800,,248,4.413043478260869
