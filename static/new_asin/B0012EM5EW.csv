This was a terrific season that started off a terrific show. It's been officially confirmed by tvshowsondvd.com that the pilot movie will be included, by the way. I hope it will also include other features like interviews or something, but, somehow, I doubt it. Ah well, maybe next time. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to seeing these great episodes again. Thank you, Paramount, for finally releasing this classic gem on DVD. Keep the sets coming!",1201737600,76,3923,4.947852760736196
3087774,5,B0012EM5EW,"THANK YOU!!! I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a very very long time.  I can't wait to watch these beloved characters again.
Ben Matlock is the best attorney I love to see his courtroom antics.
and all the actors who played with him from tyler hutson to the guy who took over Tylers job in the later episodes did such a great job gathering evidence to get the bad guys.",1201564800,2,387,4.092105263157895
3087775,5,B0012EM5EW,"Finally, after so many years of waiting and wondering whether Matlock would ever come to DVD, here it is.  In my opinion, this is the second best criminal defense show (Perry Mason is #1) that I have ever seen. Matlock could not have survived without the help of his private investigator Tyler Hudson and associate daughter Charlene Matlock. Matlock hardly ever lost a case - although in later seasons that would change.  What was great about this show was that there was enough suspense in each episode to keep you watching until the very end. Thanks for making this series available.",1200960000,37,585,4.782178217821782

3087831,4,B0012EM5EW,"i absolutely love Matlock! i read a lot of reviews for the individual seasons and the complete series. it seems that most of the complaints are regarding quality, though it appears to be a bigger issue with the complete series. my only issue was on the second DVD. the third episode had a picture problem: the top half of the screen was in color, the other half was in b&w. it was like that for maybe 60 seconds, then the episode resumed normally. for the most part i have no complaints. the show is obviously not HD quality, but that's ok. the show is still enjoyable and there was no major issues to make me not continue to purchase (season 2 will be here tomorrow)! still a great show!",1494892800,,688,4.341085271317829
3087832,1,B0012EM5EW,Maybe it got better in another season. Stupid stereotypes and a lot of people running around with not much to say or do. Zero plot.,1494720000,,131,4.28
3087833,4,B0012EM5EW,"I had never watched Matlock on television but because others I had known loved it, I decided to buy the series. I actually found it to be quite boring because each episode was almost the same. The format indicated a suspect, case solved where he or she proved to be innocent and the end. I love Andy Griffith. The price was great for all the episodes you get. The real key I believe is to take a break maybe for at least a week or two, then go back and watch missed episodes Then you will appreciate it more. So I upgraded it from 3 stars to 4.",1493596800,,544,4.046296296296297
3087834,5,B0012EM5EW,"Way better than boxed set! Had problems so I ordered all individual seasons. I had one episode that had a fuzzy top for a few seconds, but didn't bother my viewing. Mind you these are old episodes that were probably never thought to be put on disc so a few quirks I expected. No other problems with this season and I'm on the last disc.",1488499200,,336,4.184615384615385

3087866,5,B0012EM5EW,"Ok, I'm old. So take all that I write with that in mind. I'm Ron Howard's age... so Andy could have been my dad. With that background, this show is the Miss Marpel of 80'/90's tv. Now what's wrong with that?! Nothing. It's so fun. A little puzzle to solve, characters you care about and want to share their everyday bumps. Plus there are great guest stars on occasion. George Peppard's last ever appearance was on this show. Season after season it's pleasant journey. I especially loved when Don Knotts was a guest. How delightful to Andy and Don together again. I believe it's worth a watch, you won't regret it.",1483920000,5,613,4.531531531531532

When his show ""Matlock"" came around, I became a fan of that show as well.

well put together and the outcomes are not easily guessed. The chemistry and contrast between the
leading stars keeps each episode moving along. This show with the main protagonist Ben Matlock

score is also good!",1403308800,,417,4.648648648648648

3088147,5,B0012EM5EW,"Andy Griffith was so good in both of his major TV shows. A lot of that is simply due to his personal character that comes across in his roles. As a lover of Perry Mason and Columbo, Matlock is another great TV classic in that genre. As with Mason and Columbo, the mystery is there without the graphic, gory details. All three also shine because of the main character, which is half of all of their charm. Just good TV, from a time you could watch shows with kids in the room, be fully entertained, and actually feel good about life. The bad guy does get caught, and isn't celebrated as a victim. Wish we had these kinds of shows today. They sure wouldn't hurt our families.",1402099200,,673,4.307086614173229

Columbo and Matlock have to be the best of this genre and now I have the time to appreciate the series. 'Ben' is quite that Southern gentleman lawyer before the art of complex DNA and forensic science. Just one of those feelings? Yes, and he certainly does know human behavior. Definitely recommend . . . if you haven't met Benjamin Matlock, introduce yourself to Griffith's style. His daughter is his law partner and confident. 'Tyler' is his personality plus investigator and what a combination of characters! For those in the younger generation, you just might be surprised. These are not graphic or filled with the complexities of 'extreme forensics,' but they are worth watching. Enjoy!",1395446400,,794,4.760869565217392

I understand that someone was stabbed if a knife is lifted in the air and then the scene changes.  I don't need to see rage and blood.  In the book world I believe these would be called cozy mysteries-- except that Matlock is a professional.  I like them because I can watch them with my young teenagers without fear of nudity or bad language. If your young ones (12 or 13 and up) loved Nancy Drew and need more mystery this is a great series.  Andy Griffith was wonderful and he is definitely missed.",1392422400,,741,4.333333333333333

Like most shows, his/the character(s) aren't fully developed, but that is like most first seasons.

3088396,5,B0012EM5EW,"Great series of Mattock if you enjoy comedy/drama from the court room and Lawyers view! There is still a lot of Andy Griffith ""the bumpkin sheriff"" to be seen in this wonderful drama/comedy but Andy/Ben does create a complete new spin off from the Andy Griffith show from the late 50's and 60's. So set back and enjoy this great court room drama filled with humor. I will add that I usually don't enjoy court room drama but the producers and writers do a very good job of mixing the time spent in the court room with lots of investigation and research that does not take place in court room setting which makes a nice mix of humor and when they do get into court room. Ben is a very colorful and witty lawyer so the 1 hour show seems to move along pretty quickly.",1390953600,,763,4.268965517241379

I tired e-mailing Amazon with no satisfaction, which surprised me.  I've never had an issue with Amazon before, however, my dealings weren't with the digital end.

My poor review has nothing to do with my beloved Matlock.  I just can't figure out how to reverse an accidental order of $20.00 from Amazon for the Season.

I've tried so many methods, but it still comes up with me owing.  Either the cost gets reversed from my account, or I will cancel my prime membership and let all my friends know that one accidental movement can cost $20.00 to their account.",1390003200,,682,4.633333333333334

3088430,5,B0012EM5EW,"Andy was a fine man with many accomplishments and I'm so sorry he had to leave us.  My opinion is that Matlock was the very best role for him that fit his offscreen personality. I could tell he enjoyed playing this part too.  The whole show was well written and I read once that Andy had his hand into a lot of what went in the show.  The other character in this role were top-notched as well and very well placed.  I watched this show back in the day and am re-watching it.  What's not to love about it?  It's mystery, Andy's mental acuteness, his helpers all working fine together, humor, warmth and wholesomeness.  After seeing Season 1 free on Amazon Prime, I bought the DVD's for Seasons 2 and 3 right away.  Maybe Amazon will offer these Seasons free in the future but I didn't want to miss a beat.  It's a show that no matter what kind of day I'm having, watching this puts a smile to my face.",1388707200,,900,4.216374269005848

3088433,5,B0012EM5EW,"Always enjoyed this show when it originally aired and was happy to see at least one season on Amazon Instant. Although the styles are somewhat dated, the twists in the stories still entertain and apply. In the series, Andy Griffith is Columbo and Monk combined and the writers make the show very interesting. Hopefully Amazon will add the rest of the seasons to its' Prime Instant so this show can continue to be seen and enjoyed by many.",1388534400,,438,4.628205128205129
3088434,4,B0012EM5EW,"Andy Griffith of course makes this show. The weaknesses are in the secondary characters and, often, in the plots. Matlock just goobers along for a while, and then out of the blue solves the mystery and wins the case. There aren't a lot of clues that the viewer can follow.

3088450,5,B0012EM5EW,I have always been a fan of Andy Griffith. I loved him as Sheriff Taylor in the Andy Griffith show and I love him as Ben Matlock in Matlock. He is one of the best actors that I can always sit back and enjoy. I love that season 1 is instant and prime I wish they would add more seasons of instant. At least they are on DVD's so I can still get my Andy fix but I prefer instant to DVD hands down.  Andy is a person who is truly missed when he passed away. He was a very good actor and I enjoy 98% of the things he has been in. If you like trial TV shows and Andy then I can tell you 110% you will not be disappointed to watch this.,1387843200,,629,3.6592592592592594

The plots now seem improbable at the best yet they remain entertaining.  Andy Griffith is believable and engaging in the lead role as a Southern lawyer (after all, I grew up watching him as a Southern sheriff).

So I went looking to see if I could find it and it was on the 1st season.  I bought it.  Then I bought the 2nd season.  We have 2 more shows to watch on the second season and I have already ordered the 3rd season.  Like to watch them in order.....,1376784000,,358,3.77027027027027
3088582,5,B0012EM5EW,"Matlock goes is smart crime show, mixed with decency, compassion and humour. The show delicately handled  harsh subjects,  nice touches of drama and suspence, without the in your face horror many other crime shows. I am half way through season one and each episode has left me completely entertained.

I compare  Matlock to a current tv show named Psych in that they are smart, funny and the stars are very likeable even with their unique sometimes odd behavior on screen. It is a truly a joy to watch each episode.

I give the streaming experience 5 stars, quality is great and no hiccups with my fast verizon fios internet service. Using the PS3 with the installed Amazon streaming software is a perfect combination.",1376784000,,718,4.804878048780488
3088583,5,B0012EM5EW,"Years after Andy Griffith left his own show, he portrayed District Attorney Victor Worheide in the NBC Series, ""Fatal Vision,"" based on the true crime involving Jeffrey MacDonald, who brutally killed his preganant wife and two daughters.  After the premiere of that TV movie, Andy received such splendid reviews on his portrayal, that another network felt he would be perfect in a lawyer-based series of his own.  The character, Ben Matlock, with his pale blue-gray suits and down-to-earth manner, was a true characteristic of the DA he had portrayed in Fatal Vision.  The series is a winner, and each Matlock case holds my interest, even though I have seen them numerous times before.  Andy Griffith was a true legend - a wonderful actor, a great musician, and a true gentleman.  There is no one like him and we are all the poorer that he is no longer with us.  I am thankful I have this series so I am able to bring him back to life - even if it is only on the screen.",1376611200,2,970,4.514285714285714

My greatest frustration is being limited to Season 1. I would love to watch all of the seasons but not having to pay for them individually! They are listed but not available. That's the equivalent of Bait & Switch in my book. I assumed when I saw all of the seasons listed that I would be able to watch them.  :o(",1374019200,,443,4.068965517241379

3088635,5,B0012EM5EW,"Andy is at his best. The storylines are great. Ben Matlock is a modern-day Perry Mason. He never loses. His clients are always innocent with an air-tight case against them. If you ever liked Perry Mason, then this show is for you. It's the same exact scenario with the real killer almost always in the courtroom. Of course there is nothing suave or sophisticated about Ben Matlock. He's still the laid back loveable Andy we always knew. But he's sly and much smarter than he puts on. The supporting cast of two are good. Kenne Holiday is excellent as the PI (Paul Drake), and Linda Pearl is Ben's daughter who is his assistant. Everything clicks, except Linda Pearl mysteriously is dropped from the show with now explanation 6 episodes before the end of the season. Episode 1 features Dick Van Dyke in ""The Judge"", it's the best of all the episodes and when you watch that episode, you'll be hooked for good!",1371081600,,908,4.611111111111111

3088683,5,B0012EM5EW,"When ""Matlock"" arrived on the scene back in 1987 I was a demographic anomaly.  I was in my mid 30's at the time and I counted ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"" as among my favorite shows.  I had a friend in the advertising business in New York City at the time and he would just shake his head and chuckle when I told him what I liked to watch.  In any event several months ago I purchased ""Matlock:  The First Season"". I have just now completed viewing all 24 episodes.  Simply marvelous!

Without a doubt Andy Griffith had the Ben Matlock character down pat from the get-go. He is certainly the guy I would want defending me should the need ever arise.  I love the Tyler Hudson character played by Kene Holliday as well.  He sure gets himself into a lot of interesting scrapes during the inaugural season. I guess if you are a private investigator it just goes with the territory.  Meanwhile, Linda Purl proves to be nothing special as Ben's daughter Charlene and it easy to see why the character was dropped after season one. She is seen less and less as the season wears on.  But having said that I enjoyed each and every one of these 24 episodes.  My favorite?  You guessed it......""The Judge"" with special guest star Dick Van Dyke.  Am I still stuck in the Sixties or what???  Among my other favorite episodes from Matlock:  The First Season"" are ""The Sisters"", ""The Professor"" and most especially ""The People vs. Matlock"".

What is so great about ""Matlock"" is that you can enjoy the program with your wife, your children, friends or with your elderly parents.  There is minimal violence and lots of humor and language is never an issue.  For me the bottom line is that ""Matlock:  The First Season"" is great family entertainment.  I have since purchased ""Matlock: The Second Season"" and ""Matlock: The Fourth Season"" and intend to buy several more seasons.  The price is right and I will continue to enjoy this series for many years to come.  Very highly recommended.",1366761600,5,1972,4.590257879656161

3088719,5,B0012EM5EW,"The first season of MATLOCK is wonderfully presented here in this 7-disc boxed set. All 24 episodes are included in the order in which they aired, back in the 86-87 television season. The interior of the case is lined with notes that give brief descriptions of each episode, as well as their original broadcast dates.
The visual quality of each episode is top shelf, which is pretty impressive given that there does not appear to be any sort of digital re-mastering or color clean-up at all. They still have that distinctive 80's visual quality without showing any signs of age or wear. It seems that the master tapes must have been taken very good care of.

As so many reviewers have already given lengthy descriptions and commentary on each and every episode, I will simply remark on the ones that were especially noteworthy to me. As you will see, most of the episodes that I found to be the best fall into one of two categories:

The Two-Part episodes; stories that are told over two hours instead of one.
The Expedition shows; stories that take place outside Atlanta, Georgia.

Episode 1 - Diary of a Perfect Murder:

This was not a typical episode in the Matlock catalog. This was a two hour TV-movie that served as Matlock's debut to the world. Taking that into consideration, I was pleasantly surprised at how well-developed the actors had their characters at this beginning stage in their careers. This is especially noticeable with Griffith and Holliday (Matlock and Tyler), who appear settled and confident in their roles. Being two hours in length, there is, perhaps naturally, an unusually large population of characters in this episode. Everyone from Matlock and his legal team, the lead detective investigating the titular murder, to the long list of possible suspects; everyone is given their fair share of time to deliver their prowess for performance.
Of course, the story itself is quite impressive, too. It begins as a rather familiar Matlock tale of an individual supposedly murdering someone to whom they are very close, but with no apparent motive. The cards are stacked against the accused from the beginning, but Matlock is sure there is evidence that will clear his client. It's only a matter of finding proof. This is the point where the story begins to progress into a more involved structure. It turns out that the decedent was about to wed a very influential business man who has ties to some type of underground crime ring. Because he has been involved with several illegal affairs, himself, it is to his own benefit that an innocent man takes the fall for the murder he actually committed. Now it's up to the Matlock gang to unweave this campaign of deceit and deflection and achieve an acquittal for his client.
With a more complex story arch, an unusually sinister plot, and effortless chemistry between the primary actors, Diary of a Perfect Murder easily stands apart from the majority of episodes in this season and provides an outstanding introduction to the universe of Matlock.

Episode 2 - The Judge:

This episode introduces a theme that became prominent in many later Matlock stories; an authority figure who is supposed to uphold the law ends up violating it in the worst way. In this case, the very judge who is overseeing one of Matlock's trials is the true assailant of the murder Matlock's client is being charged with. Some pretty clever plot turns lead to the discovery of the judge's involvement in the homicide and his ultimate ruin.
Of course, the main reason this story stands out is due to the actor portraying the judge: TV legend Dick Van Dyke! It was nice to see Van Dyke play against his typical character type. I found him to be quite convincing as the jealous older male who kills his young lover after discovering her affair with a man much more her age. It was a fine choice to place these television legends at opposite ends of the moral spectrum. They both did a good job. This episode was sharply indicative of how the show would progress in the coming episodes. It truly had the all the classic hallmarks that made Matlock so enjoyable.

Episodes 6 & 7 - The Don (parts 1&2):

I remember seeing these two episodes on TV many years ago. I think these were responsible for instilling my adoration for Matlock in the first place. This story is a bit more intricate than many of the others. The writers for this episode ought to be commended for utilizing the two hours to their full potential. The cinematography in this episode is worth mentioning, as well. I liked the manner in which it was filmed, the scenery and camera angles. The entire visual characteristic is really pleasant. The story never lags and every few minutes there is new evidence being put into play or a new possible suspect may arise, or Matlock is in danger of being thrown off the case.
The ending is unexpected, too. I had forgotten who the killer was, after all these years. It was almost like seeing the episode for the first time, in that regard. This was one of the stories I was most eager to see when I bought this boxed set. I think you'll find that this is one of the best episodes of the season, as well.

Episode 8 - The Sisters:

This is an episode that exceedingly displayed the talent of the two lead actresses who portray the titular Sisters. A lot of character acting is on display in this one. The set design in this episode was also noteworthy. It was one of the few times that the sets really caught my attention. This story of two mentally and emotionally unstable girls who murder their aunt, then pin the blame on their uncle is a prime example of the ""classic' Matlock episode and what made this show a true pleasure to watch.

Episode 13 - The Chef:

This episode, once again, provides evidence to why Matlock is considered a classic. A popular television chef is accused of murdering her ex-husband, on live TV! The most interesting plot point of this story is that it is not immediately clear how the ex-husband was actually killed. All we see is him passing out on live television. There's no confrontation, no weapons, and no apparent motive. This has all the features an exceptional story should: a unique killing, multiple suspects, multiple motives, convincing character acting and a clever reveal of the actual murderer during the trial!

Episodes 18 & 19 - The Court-Martial (parts 1&2):

 As with all of the two-part Matlock episodes, this one is a true highlight of the season. Two intertwining stories are in motion here. The first involves Matlock and Tyler trying to defend an Army private who's accused of murdering one of his cruel superiors. The second deals with a drug smuggling ring on the army base. Matlock and Tyler have a difficult time proving their client innocent, especially since Matlock renders strong accusations towards many high-ranking officers on the base. Needless to say, the truth is gradually revealed.
Another point if interest is the casting for this episode. Several very good actors who came to fame in the 1980's make an appearance in this episode. I don't think there is any other story in the Matlock cannon that features so many well known actors all in one episode. The casting directors certainly struck a nice chord with this particular tale.

Episode 22 - The Photographer:

 My memories are very fond of this episode. This is one of the first Matlock episodes I saw as a child. I have a certain emotional attachment to this one that I do not have with very many others. I think it was the blend of good story telling and exceptional acting that left a marked impact on me. I truly believed in what I was seeing on the screen when I first saw this, many years ago. Much of this credit goes to the lead actress in this story. She genuinely plays her characters strengths and flaws in convincing fashion. Top notch character acting from her! Matlock, himself, shows a bit of a mischievous flank in this episode. A rarity for him! While trying to decide which of the three women might have actually killed the photographer, he pretends to blackmail each of them with some erotically revealing photos.
Another point of significance in this story is how involved the accused is in helping to gather evidence for Tyler and Matlock. She essentially teams up with Tyler in order to steal some negatives from a photo studio and even helps him physically chase a man who may be attempting to cover for the real killer. Later in the story, she aids Matlock in picking locks inside of her former employee's office in order to find crucial facts that will help exonerate her. I'm not sure how realistic all of this activity would be, but it certainly makes for satisfying story telling.

Episode 23 - The Reporter:

 A top-quality episode and an exceptional finale to the first season, this story broadened the horizons of the conventional story arch seen in most crime/courtroom procedurals. Instead of concerning ordinary citizens and the typical homicide investigations that most episodes featured, this tale exhibits a big government cover up involving the supposed death of some sort of federal agent. In order to make his death appear legitimate, they frame the woman he was married to for six years! Whatever agency this man is involved with, is willing to let and innocent woman take the fall for a totally falsified event.
Needless to say, Matlock is intrigued by the woman's story from the start, but when the titular Reporter begins contacting Matlock about the possibility of a cover up by the U.S. government, he becomes enthralled in trying to prove the innocence of this woman. Matlock and the reporter are forced to confront multiple questions: Who is this woman's husband, really? What type of agency does he work for? Why would they fake his death and pin it on an innocent citizen of their own country?
This story goes pretty deep into moral bearing, much more so then most episodes. Of course, that is what makes it so enjoyable from the very beginning. As with many of the episodes I've mentioned above, the acting in this story is exceptional, especially from the lead actress. She's able to communicate her feelings of confusion and vulnerability with such poise that the viewer really does believe in her strife. The actor portraying the husband, too, is very compelling in his role. He is unaware that his ""widow"" is being forced to take the fall for his alleged death. When he discovers this, we witness his emotional arch play out for the reminder of the episode in fine form.",1363392000,4,10504,4.738368910782704

As I stated I have purchased several copies of this trying to find one without this issue and have had no luck.  The picture quality is also pretty poor in some episodes (fortunately it is only terrible in a few episodes).  There were 2-3 episodes that had magnetic lines at the top like when a VHS tape has tracking issues which lead me to believe the tape masters used were not in good condition.

I'm doing that through Andy Griffith and ""Matlock--the First Season."" You see, Matlock was my father's absolutely favorite television show. I cannot say I ever watched it. I was long gone from home when he was a faithful viewer. My brother used to tell me not to go see Dad if Matlock was on.

My mother is one to say how annoyed she is if she is disturbed. Not my father. He was a quiet, unassuming man, an alcoholic, but a working alcoholic, who never missed a day of work, not even when he was sick. That still astonishes me. If one did interrupt his show, he would never let on for a minute that you had (I didn't--I followed my brother's advice. We all have our favorite things.)

3088758,3,B0012EM5EW,"""Matlock"" is yet another one of the multitude of crime series that surfaced in the 1980's, this time taking the form of a courtroom drama, with high-priced Southern lawyer Ben Matlock (Andy Griffith) as the detective. Compared with some of the other crime series of this era, such as ""Murder She Wrote"", the scripts of ""Matlock"" are incredibly lame - the mysteries are terrible (not enough clues are given, and Matlock frequently solves them by pulling some piece of evidence out of nowhere at the last minute) and Matlock often seems to win his cases because the District Attorney is absolutely incompetent, for example, never objecting even though it is blatantly obvious that he should be. ""Matlock"" is redeemed, however, by the charisma of the main actors. Although Linda Purl, as Matlock's daughter Charlene, has about as much personality as a clothes horse (something which the makers of this series must have noticed, since she vanishes several episodes before the end of this season), Andy Griffith and Kene Holliday (as private investigator Tyler Hudson) both have more than enough personality to compensate and make this series worth watching.

This DVD set includes the 23 first season episodes of ""Matlock"", along with the tele-movie ""Diary of a Perfect Murder"", which serves as a pilot to this series (and features a different actress as Matlock's daughter).",1223510400,,1371,5.120535714285714

3088779,4,B0012EM5EW,"In pop culture, decades tend to bleed over into one another.  The fashions of the 1970s, for example, particularly the mid- to late-'70s, lingered in the air for a big chunk of the '80s, notably in films and on TV.  The first season of the tongue-in-cheek crime drama ""Matlock"" is a great example: even though it aired in 1986-87, the show oozed a 'Seventies sensibility, from the onscreen fashion and acting, to the very feel of the show itself. Partly this is because the show was clearly an homage to many of the offbeat police dramas that came before it -- ""Columbo"", ""McCloud,"" etc. -- along with a whiff of the mildly risque hanky-panky of '70s romance shows such as ""Love Boat,"" etc.

""Matlock"" is a delightfully formulaic series, with Andy Griffith playing a doddering but undefeatable Southern ""country"" lawyer who commands big fees and wins big cases. His sidekicks include his spunky but sometimes naive daughter and a semi-retired, self-deprecating private eye who provides some ""Magnum""-style muscle.  The bad guys include various staple figures of '80s TV --  slightly sleazy swingers, smug yuppie types, corrupt establishment figures, etc.  The acting is stiff, the pacing of the show is almost lethargic by today's standards, the plot twists come 'round the bend like an old, slow freight train.  And that's part of the charm. The show feels like a pair of old, comfortable shoes --  Also fun is watching  the show find its legs, as all first-season shows must, and the writers, actors and producers figure out what works and how the show will define itself.

Fans of the series will be delighted to see this finally out on DVD; newcomers will also enjoy it as a trip down memory lane... even if they weren't there the first time around!  (Slipcue film reviews)",1206921600,14,1777,4.8509933774834435

3088781,4,B0012EM5EW,"Here it is, almost 1200 minutes of the mystery series ""Matlock"", 24 episodes (including the pilot) that were broadcast during NBC's 1986-1987 season.  So let's forget all we know about the long run of this series and just talk about its premiere season.

Years after his run as Sheriff Andy Taylor, Andy Griffith finally got another regular job.  This time he is playing Ben Matlock, an Atlanta lawyer who talks like Sheriff Andy.  It's a comfortable role in a tried and true format; a mix of ""Perry Mason"" and ""Columbo"".  ""Columbo"" veteran Dean Hargrove dreamed up the series and shared executive producer duties with Fred Silverman.

The focus is on the title character and Griffith is great fun to watch.  He charms and sweet talks his way through each case, getting everyone to let down their guard because they underestimate this good old boy as much as they did the seemingly scatterbrained ""Columbo"".  Both series revolved around the main character's ability discern something incriminating in seemingly innocent little things and to pick up on a guilty party's casual slip of the tongue.

In the ""Perry Mason"" tradition Matlock is not bound by the conventional rules of evidence or procedural requirements once he gets into a courtroom.  He can say anything and introduce any sort of evidence simply by reassuring the judge that his line or questioning will eventually become relevant.  Be prepared for the obligatory breakdowns and confessions on the witness stand.  The prosecutors can only shake their heads and bluster helplessly in the face of Matlock's cunning strategy.

Matlock is assisted by the show's version of Perry Mason's Paul and Della.  In season one these are his daughter and partner Charlene Matlock (Lori Lethin in the pilot-Linda Purl in the regular episodes) and his investigator Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday).  His junior partner Michele Thomas (Nancy Stafford) would not join the team as a regular until the next season and it wasn't until 1988 that Don Knotts reprised his Barney role as Ben's neighbor Les ""Ace"" Calhoun.

Season One's episodes #6 and #7 (a two part story titled ""The Don"") featured William Conrad as District Attorney James ""Fatman"" McShane.  The  next year the producers took this character, changed his name slightly to Jason Lochinvar 'Fatman' McCabe, and with Conrad created the long-running series ""Jake and the Fatman"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1205539200,36,2424,5.057934508816121
3088782,5,B0012EM5EW,"I am personally glad this is the real authentic Matlock DVD. It's about time!!! For years, anyone on line anyone could purchase Matlock on DVD, however it was being sold by people who copied off TV and then burned on DVD.  I verified this directly by calling Paramount studios.  I will say by calling the studios and speaking to the direct person in charge of releasing tv progams on DVD helped.  I have been a fan of Andy Griffith for years.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and look forward to the release 04-08-08!  Thanks Paramount for the release!!!",1205366400,8,562,4.58

It is the cleanest detective show that anyone can watch and enjoy.  I love watching the reruns on WGN at 1pm.  Its a bummer that Hallmark took it off in the afternoons and only sometimes shows it at night.  April 8th can not get here fast enough :).",1204934400,4,365,4.231884057971015

After school with my mother, we'd watch Matlock and i was always engrossed by the different cases, with its intriguing bad guys and the detective work of Matlock and Tyler (then Conrad) was always solid and thorough. When the case was in court, it was always great to see Matlock stick it to the guilty. Great show and thank god it is coming to dvd, i'll be buying it.",1204243200,,414,4.3896103896103895

This was a terrific season that started off a terrific show. It's been officially confirmed by tvshowsondvd.com that the pilot movie will be included, by the way. I hope it will also include other features like interviews or something, but, somehow, I doubt it. Ah well, maybe next time. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to seeing these great episodes again. Thank you, Paramount, for finally releasing this classic gem on DVD. Keep the sets coming!",1201737600,76,3923,4.947852760736196
3322271,5,B0012EM5EW,"THANK YOU!!! I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a very very long time.  I can't wait to watch these beloved characters again.
Ben Matlock is the best attorney I love to see his courtroom antics.
and all the actors who played with him from tyler hutson to the guy who took over Tylers job in the later episodes did such a great job gathering evidence to get the bad guys.",1201564800,2,387,4.092105263157895
3322272,5,B0012EM5EW,"Finally, after so many years of waiting and wondering whether Matlock would ever come to DVD, here it is.  In my opinion, this is the second best criminal defense show (Perry Mason is #1) that I have ever seen. Matlock could not have survived without the help of his private investigator Tyler Hudson and associate daughter Charlene Matlock. Matlock hardly ever lost a case - although in later seasons that would change.  What was great about this show was that there was enough suspense in each episode to keep you watching until the very end. Thanks for making this series available.",1200960000,37,585,4.782178217821782

3322330,4,B0012EM5EW,"I had never watched Matlock on television but because others I had known loved it, I decided to buy the series. I actually found it to be quite boring because each episode was almost the same. The format indicated a suspect, case solved where he or she proved to be innocent and the end. I love Andy Griffith. The price was great for all the episodes you get. The real key I believe is to take a break maybe for at least a week or two, then go back and watch missed episodes Then you will appreciate it more. So I upgraded it from 3 stars to 4.",1493596800,,544,4.046296296296297

With that background, this show is the Miss Marpel of 80'/90's tv. Now what's wrong with that?! Nothing. It's so fun. A little puzzle to solve, characters you care about and want to share their everyday bumps. Plus there are great guest stars on occasion. George Peppard's last ever appearance was on this show. Season after season it's pleasant journey. I especially loved when Don Knotts was a guest. How delightful to Andy and Don together again.

3322644,5,B0012EM5EW,"Andy Griffith was so good in both of his major TV shows. A lot of that is simply due to his personal character that comes across in his roles. As a lover of Perry Mason and Columbo, Matlock is another great TV classic in that genre. As with Mason and Columbo, the mystery is there without the graphic, gory details. All three also shine because of the main character, which is half of all of their charm. Just good TV, from a time you could watch shows with kids in the room, be fully entertained, and actually feel good about life. The bad guy does get caught, and isn't celebrated as a victim. Wish we had these kinds of shows today. They sure wouldn't hurt our families.",1402099200,,673,4.307086614173229

Columbo and Matlock have to be the best of this genre and now I have the time to appreciate the series. 'Ben' is quite that Southern gentleman lawyer before the art of complex DNA and forensic science. Just one of those feelings? Yes, and he certainly does know human behavior. Definitely recommend . . . if you haven't met Benjamin Matlock, introduce yourself to Griffith's style. His daughter is his law partner and confident. 'Tyler' is his personality plus investigator and what a combination of characters! For those in the younger generation, you just might be surprised. These are not graphic or filled with the complexities of 'extreme forensics,' but they are worth watching. Enjoy!",1395446400,,794,4.760869565217392

I understand that people commit adultery if there are 2 bodies under the sheets, I don't need to see them naked.  I understand that someone was stabbed if a knife is lifted in the air and then the scene changes.  I don't need to see rage and blood.  In the book world I believe these would be called cozy mysteries-- except that Matlock is a professional.  I like them because I can watch them with my young teenagers without fear of nudity or bad language. If your young ones (12 or 13 and up) loved Nancy Drew and need more mystery this is a great series.  Andy Griffith was wonderful and he is definitely missed.",1392422400,,741,4.333333333333333

Like most shows, his/the character(s) aren't fully developed, but that is like most first seasons.

3322893,5,B0012EM5EW,"Great series of Mattock if you enjoy comedy/drama from the court room and Lawyers view! There is still a lot of Andy Griffith ""the bumpkin sheriff"" to be seen in this wonderful drama/comedy but Andy/Ben does create a complete new spin off from the Andy Griffith show from the late 50's and 60's. So set back and enjoy this great court room drama filled with humor. I will add that I usually don't enjoy court room drama but the producers and writers do a very good job of mixing the time spent in the court room with lots of investigation and research that does not take place in court room setting which makes a nice mix of humor and when they do get into court room. Ben is a very colorful and witty lawyer so the 1 hour show seems to move along pretty quickly.",1390953600,,763,4.268965517241379

3322900,4,B0012EM5EW,I really like Matlock's no nonsense attitude but he's also got a very amusing human side.  The cases and characters are a little cheesy but it's the 80s so you u can forgive it.,1390867200,,177,4.205882352941177

I tired e-mailing Amazon with no satisfaction, which surprised me.  I've never had an issue with Amazon before, however, my dealings weren't with the digital end.

My poor review has nothing to do with my beloved Matlock.  I just can't figure out how to reverse an accidental order of $20.00 from Amazon for the Season.

I've tried so many methods, but it still comes up with me owing.  Either the cost gets reversed from my account, or I will cancel my prime membership and let all my friends know that one accidental movement can cost $20.00 to their account.",1390003200,,682,4.633333333333334

3322927,5,B0012EM5EW,"Andy was a fine man with many accomplishments and I'm so sorry he had to leave us.  My opinion is that Matlock was the very best role for him that fit his offscreen personality. I could tell he enjoyed playing this part too.  The whole show was well written and I read once that Andy had his hand into a lot of what went in the show.  The other character in this role were top-notched as well and very well placed.  I watched this show back in the day and am re-watching it.  What's not to love about it?  It's mystery, Andy's mental acuteness, his helpers all working fine together, humor, warmth and wholesomeness.  After seeing Season 1 free on Amazon Prime, I bought the DVD's for Seasons 2 and 3 right away.  Maybe Amazon will offer these Seasons free in the future but I didn't want to miss a beat.

3322947,5,B0012EM5EW,I have always been a fan of Andy Griffith. I loved him as Sheriff Taylor in the Andy Griffith show and I love him as Ben Matlock in Matlock. He is one of the best actors that I can always sit back and enjoy. I love that season 1 is instant and prime I wish they would add more seasons of instant. At least they are on DVD's so I can still get my Andy fix but I prefer instant to DVD hands down.  Andy is a person who is truly missed when he passed away. He was a very good actor and I enjoy 98% of the things he has been in.

3322961,5,B0012EM5EW,"Thank you for offering this on Amazon Prime. We have enjoyed watching Matlock and look forward to additional episodes being released. This is one of the reasons we maintain Prime verses cable or Satellite.

They really are my cup of tea.  I could watch for hours on end.  I like all of the charaters on the show, I love the story line and when Matlock is in the courtroom.

Nice pacing, occasionally ""corny"", but always fun to watch. A great blend of light comedy, painless drama, courtroom drama, and the right blend of fun and anticipation. I love this series. MAIN PROBLEM = I can only get Season 1 on Amazon Prime, and I only have 2 episodes left to enjoy when I want to just enjoy and relax.",1376956800,,612,4.783018867924528

So I went looking to see if I could find it and it was on the 1st season.  I bought it.  Then I bought the 2nd season.  We have 2 more shows to watch on the second season and I have already ordered the 3rd season.  Like to watch them in order.....,1376784000,,358,3.77027027027027

The show delicately handled  harsh subjects,  nice touches of drama and suspence, without the in your face horror many other crime shows. I am half way through season one and each episode has left me completely entertained.

I compare  Matlock to a current tv show named Psych in that they are smart, funny and the stars are very likeable even with their unique sometimes odd behavior on screen. It is a truly a joy to watch each episode.

I give the streaming experience 5 stars, quality is great and no hiccups with my fast verizon fios internet service. Using the PS3 with the installed Amazon streaming software is a perfect combination.",1376784000,,718,4.804878048780488
3323080,5,B0012EM5EW,"Years after Andy Griffith left his own show, he portrayed District Attorney Victor Worheide in the NBC Series, ""Fatal Vision,"" based on the true crime involving Jeffrey MacDonald, who brutally killed his preganant wife and two daughters.  After the premiere of that TV movie, Andy received such splendid reviews on his portrayal, that another network felt he would be perfect in a lawyer-based series of his own.  The character, Ben Matlock, with his pale blue-gray suits and down-to-earth manner, was a true characteristic of the DA he had portrayed in Fatal Vision.  The series is a winner, and each Matlock case holds my interest, even though I have seen them numerous times before.  Andy Griffith was a true legend - a wonderful actor, a great musician, and a true gentleman.  There is no one like him and we are all the poorer that he is no longer with us.

3323132,5,B0012EM5EW,"Andy is at his best. The storylines are great. Ben Matlock is a modern-day Perry Mason. He never loses. His clients are always innocent with an air-tight case against them. If you ever liked Perry Mason, then this show is for you. It's the same exact scenario with the real killer almost always in the courtroom. Of course there is nothing suave or sophisticated about Ben Matlock. He's still the laid back loveable Andy we always knew. But he's sly and much smarter than he puts on. The supporting cast of two are good. Kenne Holiday is excellent as the PI (Paul Drake), and Linda Pearl is Ben's daughter who is his assistant. Everything clicks, except Linda Pearl mysteriously is dropped from the show with now explanation 6 episodes before the end of the season. Episode 1 features Dick Van Dyke in ""The Judge"", it's the best of all the episodes and when you watch that episode, you'll be hooked for good!",1371081600,,908,4.611111111111111

3323180,5,B0012EM5EW,"When ""Matlock"" arrived on the scene back in 1987 I was a demographic anomaly.  I was in my mid 30's at the time and I counted ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"" as among my favorite shows.  I had a friend in the advertising business in New York City at the time and he would just shake his head and chuckle when I told him what I liked to watch.  In any event several months ago I purchased ""Matlock:  The First Season"". I have just now completed viewing all 24 episodes.  Simply marvelous!

Without a doubt Andy Griffith had the Ben Matlock character down pat from the get-go. He is certainly the guy I would want defending me should the need ever arise.  I love the Tyler Hudson character played by Kene Holliday as well.  He sure gets himself into a lot of interesting scrapes during the inaugural season. I guess if you are a private investigator it just goes with the territory.  Meanwhile, Linda Purl proves to be nothing special as Ben's daughter Charlene and it easy to see why the character was dropped after season one. She is seen less and less as the season wears on.  But having said that I enjoyed each and every one of these 24 episodes.  My favorite?  You guessed it......""The Judge"" with special guest star Dick Van Dyke.  Am I still stuck in the Sixties or what???  Among my other favorite episodes from Matlock:  The First Season"" are ""The Sisters"", ""The Professor"" and most especially ""The People vs. Matlock"".

What is so great about ""Matlock"" is that you can enjoy the program with your wife, your children, friends or with your elderly parents.  There is minimal violence and lots of humor and language is never an issue.  For me the bottom line is that ""Matlock:  The First Season"" is great family entertainment.  I have since purchased ""Matlock: The Second Season"" and ""Matlock: The Fourth Season"" and intend to buy several more seasons.  The price is right and I will continue to enjoy this series for many years to come.  Very highly recommended.",1366761600,5,1972,4.590257879656161

The reality shows are stupidly unreal with a mercenary goal.

3323216,5,B0012EM5EW,"The first season of MATLOCK is wonderfully presented here in this 7-disc boxed set. All 24 episodes are included in the order in which they aired, back in the 86-87 television season. The interior of the case is lined with notes that give brief descriptions of each episode, as well as their original broadcast dates.
The visual quality of each episode is top shelf, which is pretty impressive given that there does not appear to be any sort of digital re-mastering or color clean-up at all. They still have that distinctive 80's visual quality without showing any signs of age or wear. It seems that the master tapes must have been taken very good care of.

As so many reviewers have already given lengthy descriptions and commentary on each and every episode, I will simply remark on the ones that were especially noteworthy to me. As you will see, most of the episodes that I found to be the best fall into one of two categories:

The Two-Part episodes; stories that are told over two hours instead of one.
The Expedition shows; stories that take place outside Atlanta, Georgia.

Episode 1 - Diary of a Perfect Murder:

This was not a typical episode in the Matlock catalog. This was a two hour TV-movie that served as Matlock's debut to the world. Taking that into consideration, I was pleasantly surprised at how well-developed the actors had their characters at this beginning stage in their careers. This is especially noticeable with Griffith and Holliday (Matlock and Tyler), who appear settled and confident in their roles. Being two hours in length, there is, perhaps naturally, an unusually large population of characters in this episode. Everyone from Matlock and his legal team, the lead detective investigating the titular murder, to the long list of possible suspects; everyone is given their fair share of time to deliver their prowess for performance.
Of course, the story itself is quite impressive, too. It begins as a rather familiar Matlock tale of an individual supposedly murdering someone to whom they are very close, but with no apparent motive. The cards are stacked against the accused from the beginning, but Matlock is sure there is evidence that will clear his client. It's only a matter of finding proof. This is the point where the story begins to progress into a more involved structure. It turns out that the decedent was about to wed a very influential business man who has ties to some type of underground crime ring. Because he has been involved with several illegal affairs, himself, it is to his own benefit that an innocent man takes the fall for the murder he actually committed. Now it's up to the Matlock gang to unweave this campaign of deceit and deflection and achieve an acquittal for his client.
With a more complex story arch, an unusually sinister plot, and effortless chemistry between the primary actors, Diary of a Perfect Murder easily stands apart from the majority of episodes in this season and provides an outstanding introduction to the universe of Matlock.

Episode 2 - The Judge:

This episode introduces a theme that became prominent in many later Matlock stories; an authority figure who is supposed to uphold the law ends up violating it in the worst way. In this case, the very judge who is overseeing one of Matlock's trials is the true assailant of the murder Matlock's client is being charged with. Some pretty clever plot turns lead to the discovery of the judge's involvement in the homicide and his ultimate ruin.
Of course, the main reason this story stands out is due to the actor portraying the judge: TV legend Dick Van Dyke! It was nice to see Van Dyke play against his typical character type. I found him to be quite convincing as the jealous older male who kills his young lover after discovering her affair with a man much more her age. It was a fine choice to place these television legends at opposite ends of the moral spectrum. They both did a good job. This episode was sharply indicative of how the show would progress in the coming episodes. It truly had the all the classic hallmarks that made Matlock so enjoyable.

Episodes 6 & 7 - The Don (parts 1&2):

I remember seeing these two episodes on TV many years ago. I think these were responsible for instilling my adoration for Matlock in the first place. This story is a bit more intricate than many of the others. The writers for this episode ought to be commended for utilizing the two hours to their full potential. The cinematography in this episode is worth mentioning, as well. I liked the manner in which it was filmed, the scenery and camera angles. The entire visual characteristic is really pleasant. The story never lags and every few minutes there is new evidence being put into play or a new possible suspect may arise, or Matlock is in danger of being thrown off the case.
The ending is unexpected, too. I had forgotten who the killer was, after all these years. It was almost like seeing the episode for the first time, in that regard. This was one of the stories I was most eager to see when I bought this boxed set. I think you'll find that this is one of the best episodes of the season, as well.

Episode 8 - The Sisters:

This is an episode that exceedingly displayed the talent of the two lead actresses who portray the titular Sisters. A lot of character acting is on display in this one. The set design in this episode was also noteworthy. It was one of the few times that the sets really caught my attention. This story of two mentally and emotionally unstable girls who murder their aunt, then pin the blame on their uncle is a prime example of the ""classic' Matlock episode and what made this show a true pleasure to watch.

Episode 13 - The Chef:

This episode, once again, provides evidence to why Matlock is considered a classic. A popular television chef is accused of murdering her ex-husband, on live TV! The most interesting plot point of this story is that it is not immediately clear how the ex-husband was actually killed. All we see is him passing out on live television. There's no confrontation, no weapons, and no apparent motive. This has all the features an exceptional story should: a unique killing, multiple suspects, multiple motives, convincing character acting and a clever reveal of the actual murderer during the trial!

Episodes 18 & 19 - The Court-Martial (parts 1&2):

 As with all of the two-part Matlock episodes, this one is a true highlight of the season. Two intertwining stories are in motion here. The first involves Matlock and Tyler trying to defend an Army private who's accused of murdering one of his cruel superiors. The second deals with a drug smuggling ring on the army base. Matlock and Tyler have a difficult time proving their client innocent, especially since Matlock renders strong accusations towards many high-ranking officers on the base. Needless to say, the truth is gradually revealed.
Another point if interest is the casting for this episode. Several very good actors who came to fame in the 1980's make an appearance in this episode. I don't think there is any other story in the Matlock cannon that features so many well known actors all in one episode. The casting directors certainly struck a nice chord with this particular tale.

Episode 22 - The Photographer:

 My memories are very fond of this episode. This is one of the first Matlock episodes I saw as a child. I have a certain emotional attachment to this one that I do not have with very many others. I think it was the blend of good story telling and exceptional acting that left a marked impact on me. I truly believed in what I was seeing on the screen when I first saw this, many years ago. Much of this credit goes to the lead actress in this story. She genuinely plays her characters strengths and flaws in convincing fashion. Top notch character acting from her! Matlock, himself, shows a bit of a mischievous flank in this episode. A rarity for him! While trying to decide which of the three women might have actually killed the photographer, he pretends to blackmail each of them with some erotically revealing photos.
Another point of significance in this story is how involved the accused is in helping to gather evidence for Tyler and Matlock. She essentially teams up with Tyler in order to steal some negatives from a photo studio and even helps him physically chase a man who may be attempting to cover for the real killer. Later in the story, she aids Matlock in picking locks inside of her former employee's office in order to find crucial facts that will help exonerate her. I'm not sure how realistic all of this activity would be, but it certainly makes for satisfying story telling.

Episode 23 - The Reporter:

 A top-quality episode and an exceptional finale to the first season, this story broadened the horizons of the conventional story arch seen in most crime/courtroom procedurals. Instead of concerning ordinary citizens and the typical homicide investigations that most episodes featured, this tale exhibits a big government cover up involving the supposed death of some sort of federal agent. In order to make his death appear legitimate, they frame the woman he was married to for six years! Whatever agency this man is involved with, is willing to let and innocent woman take the fall for a totally falsified event.
Needless to say, Matlock is intrigued by the woman's story from the start, but when the titular Reporter begins contacting Matlock about the possibility of a cover up by the U.S. government, he becomes enthralled in trying to prove the innocence of this woman. Matlock and the reporter are forced to confront multiple questions: Who is this woman's husband, really? What type of agency does he work for? Why would they fake his death and pin it on an innocent citizen of their own country?
This story goes pretty deep into moral bearing, much more so then most episodes. Of course, that is what makes it so enjoyable from the very beginning. As with many of the episodes I've mentioned above, the acting in this story is exceptional, especially from the lead actress. She's able to communicate her feelings of confusion and vulnerability with such poise that the viewer really does believe in her strife. The actor portraying the husband, too, is very compelling in his role. He is unaware that his ""widow"" is being forced to take the fall for his alleged death. When he discovers this, we witness his emotional arch play out for the reminder of the episode in fine form.",1363392000,4,10504,4.738368910782704

First of all the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.  I have owned multiple copies of this and several of them had broken clips that hold the disc in place, they also all have very wavy, wrinkled looking plastic on the front cover which in my opinion looks defective.  As I stated I have purchased several copies of this trying to find one without this issue and have had no luck.  The picture quality is also pretty poor in some episodes (fortunately it is only terrible in a few episodes).  There were 2-3 episodes that had magnetic lines at the top like when a VHS tape has tracking issues which lead me to believe the tape masters used were not in good condition.  I am now watching season 2 and am happy to report that the picture quality as well as the packaging is better.  Also on a purely objective note I feel the writing got a lot better later in the season and subsequent seasons.

The second one I received the first DVD was loose because the holder was broke again (doesn't take much) but I kept it anyways and just have to be extra careful with that season.

I'm doing that through Andy Griffith and ""Matlock--the First Season."" You see, Matlock was my father's absolutely favorite television show. I cannot say I ever watched it. I was long gone from home when he was a faithful viewer. My brother used to tell me not to go see Dad if Matlock was on.

My mother is one to say how annoyed she is if she is disturbed. Not my father. He was a quiet, unassuming man, an alcoholic, but a working alcoholic, who never missed a day of work, not even when he was sick. That still astonishes me. If one did interrupt his show, he would never let on for a minute that you had (I didn't--I followed my brother's advice. We all have our favorite things.)

I adored Andy Griffith and ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" but never saw ""Matlock."" Maybe I need to, just to understand my father a little more. In his own way, he was a good man. Like Andy Griffith, like Matlock, but in a different way. Happy birthday, Daddy!",1256342400,4,1072,4.355

3323255,3,B0012EM5EW,"""Matlock"" is yet another one of the multitude of crime series that surfaced in the 1980's, this time taking the form of a courtroom drama, with high-priced Southern lawyer Ben Matlock (Andy Griffith) as the detective. Compared with some of the other crime series of this era, such as ""Murder She Wrote"", the scripts of ""Matlock"" are incredibly lame - the mysteries are terrible (not enough clues are given, and Matlock frequently solves them by pulling some piece of evidence out of nowhere at the last minute) and Matlock often seems to win his cases because the District Attorney is absolutely incompetent, for example, never objecting even though it is blatantly obvious that he should be. ""Matlock"" is redeemed, however, by the charisma of the main actors. Although Linda Purl, as Matlock's daughter Charlene, has about as much personality as a clothes horse (something which the makers of this series must have noticed, since she vanishes several episodes before the end of this season), Andy Griffith and Kene Holliday (as private investigator Tyler Hudson) both have more than enough personality to compensate and make this series worth watching.

This DVD set includes the 23 first season episodes of ""Matlock"", along with the tele-movie ""Diary of a Perfect Murder"", which serves as a pilot to this series (and features a different actress as Matlock's daughter).",1223510400,,1371,5.120535714285714

The main reason is that my mom is hard of hearing and I expected
this set to have english subtitles at the very least. I have
learned that it does not. It does have closed captioning but
my parents tv does not have this capability.

Well, that's exactly what you get with this Matlock DVD set, with the only difference being that you pay 30 times more for it!  Images are fuzzy and blurred, except for in extreme close-ups that fill the screen.  In many scenes it actually has ""wavy distortion"" of distracting artificats going along the top of the screen.
It's really too bad, because DVDs are capable of a much-better picture quality than this. If the quality of picture doesn't matter to you, then you will totally enjoy this set.

3323276,4,B0012EM5EW,"In pop culture, decades tend to bleed over into one another.  The fashions of the 1970s, for example, particularly the mid- to late-'70s, lingered in the air for a big chunk of the '80s, notably in films and on TV.  The first season of the tongue-in-cheek crime drama ""Matlock"" is a great example: even though it aired in 1986-87, the show oozed a 'Seventies sensibility, from the onscreen fashion and acting, to the very feel of the show itself. Partly this is because the show was clearly an homage to many of the offbeat police dramas that came before it -- ""Columbo"", ""McCloud,"" etc. -- along with a whiff of the mildly risque hanky-panky of '70s romance shows such as ""Love Boat,"" etc.

""Matlock"" is a delightfully formulaic series, with Andy Griffith playing a doddering but undefeatable Southern ""country"" lawyer who commands big fees and wins big cases. His sidekicks include his spunky but sometimes naive daughter and a semi-retired, self-deprecating private eye who provides some ""Magnum""-style muscle.  The bad guys include various staple figures of '80s TV --  slightly sleazy swingers, smug yuppie types, corrupt establishment figures, etc.  The acting is stiff, the pacing of the show is almost lethargic by today's standards, the plot twists come 'round the bend like an old, slow freight train.  And that's part of the charm. The show feels like a pair of old, comfortable shoes --  Also fun is watching  the show find its legs, as all first-season shows must, and the writers, actors and producers figure out what works and how the show will define itself.

Fans of the series will be delighted to see this finally out on DVD; newcomers will also enjoy it as a trip down memory lane... even if they weren't there the first time around!  (Slipcue film reviews)",1206921600,14,1777,4.8509933774834435

3323278,4,B0012EM5EW,"Here it is, almost 1200 minutes of the mystery series ""Matlock"", 24 episodes (including the pilot) that were broadcast during NBC's 1986-1987 season.  So let's forget all we know about the long run of this series and just talk about its premiere season.

Years after his run as Sheriff Andy Taylor, Andy Griffith finally got another regular job.  This time he is playing Ben Matlock, an Atlanta lawyer who talks like Sheriff Andy.  It's a comfortable role in a tried and true format; a mix of ""Perry Mason"" and ""Columbo"".  ""Columbo"" veteran Dean Hargrove dreamed up the series and shared executive producer duties with Fred Silverman.

The focus is on the title character and Griffith is great fun to watch.  He charms and sweet talks his way through each case, getting everyone to let down their guard because they underestimate this good old boy as much as they did the seemingly scatterbrained ""Columbo"".  Both series revolved around the main character's ability discern something incriminating in seemingly innocent little things and to pick up on a guilty party's casual slip of the tongue.

In the ""Perry Mason"" tradition Matlock is not bound by the conventional rules of evidence or procedural requirements once he gets into a courtroom.  He can say anything and introduce any sort of evidence simply by reassuring the judge that his line or questioning will eventually become relevant.  Be prepared for the obligatory breakdowns and confessions on the witness stand.  The prosecutors can only shake their heads and bluster helplessly in the face of Matlock's cunning strategy.

Matlock is assisted by the show's version of Perry Mason's Paul and Della.  In season one these are his daughter and partner Charlene Matlock (Lori Lethin in the pilot-Linda Purl in the regular episodes) and his investigator Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday).  His junior partner Michele Thomas (Nancy Stafford) would not join the team as a regular until the next season and it wasn't until 1988 that Don Knotts reprised his Barney role as Ben's neighbor Les ""Ace"" Calhoun.

Season One's episodes #6 and #7 (a two part story titled ""The Don"") featured William Conrad as District Attorney James ""Fatman"" McShane.  The  next year the producers took this character, changed his name slightly to Jason Lochinvar 'Fatman' McCabe, and with Conrad created the long-running series ""Jake and the Fatman"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1205539200,36,2424,5.057934508816121
3323279,5,B0012EM5EW,"I am personally glad this is the real authentic Matlock DVD. It's about time!!! For years, anyone on line anyone could purchase Matlock on DVD, however it was being sold by people who copied off TV and then burned on DVD.  I verified this directly by calling Paramount studios.  I will say by calling the studios and speaking to the direct person in charge of releasing tv progams on DVD helped.  I have been a fan of Andy Griffith for years.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and look forward to the release 04-08-08!  Thanks Paramount for the release!!!",1205366400,8,562,4.58

It is the cleanest detective show that anyone can watch and enjoy.  I love watching the reruns on WGN at 1pm.  Its a bummer that Hallmark took it off in the afternoons and only sometimes shows it at night.  April 8th can not get here fast enough :).",1204934400,4,365,4.231884057971015

After school with my mother, we'd watch Matlock and i was always engrossed by the different cases, with its intriguing bad guys and the detective work of Matlock and Tyler (then Conrad) was always solid and thorough. When the case was in court, it was always great to see Matlock stick it to the guilty. Great show and thank god it is coming to dvd, i'll be buying it.",1204243200,,414,4.3896103896103895

I'm always hunting more wholesome tv fare for my family to watch together (husband, 15 year old son, 23 year old daughter) and knew that I could rely on Andy.  Kids love seeing another side of him that still includes a bit of homespun humor. I enjoyed the entire cast throughout the run, but Linda Purl was a favorite.",1518825600,,392,4.585714285714285
