However, this artist seemed to believe, ""No one can beat Michelangelo, so all one can do is imitate him.""  He seemed perfectly happy to honor and copy the masters.  The work isn't afraid to speak of his shortcomings.  He used materials that cracked his paintings.  He too believed that classic-historical paintings were superlative, but his contributions to that style are called weak here.

I saw the installment of this series on Gainsborough before seeing this one.  In that piece, the beef and then reconciliation between Gainsborough and Reynolds is emphasized; here it is barely mentioned.  Perhaps since Reynolds supported the Academy, in the long run he was considered the victor of the erstwhile rivalry.

The work admits that modern viewers may see some of Reynolds' portraits as contrived.  I'm glad they pointed that out as I grew irritated seeing people painted the size of ships and others positioned in such fake and unnatural poses.

Italian and Dutch painters are brought up, but never the French.  It's astonishing to see that that country is or was not always seen as a cultural epicenter.  Like Adam Smith, Philip Seymour Hoffman, or Justice David Souter, this work states that Reynolds was a heterosexual male who never married.  Later, it says he was challenged by deafness and blindness, but it's never stated if that was just an expected end of life issue or if it majorly influenced or stalled his work.  Was he similar to a Thomas Edison or Derek Jarman, or diametrically different from them?",1212105600,,1614,4.9664179104477615
