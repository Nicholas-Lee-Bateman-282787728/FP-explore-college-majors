8608271,5,B001OXYGL6,"What a great video - I have worked out to it by myself and with my kids.  My kids needed to take some breaks because it is a pretty tough workout, but they loved learning the moves and trying to keep up with the kids featured on the video.  The leader is fun and positive throughout the video.  As a physical therapist, I can vouch that the progression and exercises are safe.  Adults and kids will feel energized after this workout video!",1243814400,,439,4.317073170731708
8608272,5,B001OXYGL6,"This is a super high energy, fun workout video that your kids will love.  It's great to do together with them too!  Theresa does a great job sending out positive messages to kids...be proud about who you are, work hard and achieve great things.  She really cares about the kids and the workout and it shows.  So if you want your kids to start exercising and also want to give them some positive messages (and who doesn't!) this video will work for you.",1243814400,,452,4.409638554216867
