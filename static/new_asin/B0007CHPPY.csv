8046717,5,B0007CHPPY,Great 3D HQFS movie .... Production is great ... This is made for to work only 3D LCD Shutterglasses system (e.g. eDimensional 3D glasses system) -- NOT for Red-Blue Anaglyph eyeglasses.,1256169600,2,186,5.032258064516129
8046718,3,B0007CHPPY,I really have mixed feelings with this movie. I watched it in HQFS 3D and I thought the effects were really cool! This has to be the most random 3D movie I have ever seen! It goes from teddy bears flying off a conveyer belt to some fat guy in a lake watching TV! There was one scene which I thought was cool! It was a man fencing sticking the sword out of the screen! I don't know if I should recommend this or not! Oh well!,1247097600,,424,3.8850574712643677
8046719,4,B0007CHPPY,"i liked this quite a bit....It's not very long, but it isn't lame/cheesy like so many of the later IMAX projects were/are (did we REALLY need a 3D Elvira movie?).

Completely dialogue-less film, just exploring the fun of 3D imagery in sort of a random fashion (nature scenes, industrial scenes, abstract stuff, etc.).

Only problem is that the left/right eye views often are not vertically aligned, which can result in eye fatigue.

Get this and ""Spy Kids 3D:  The Extreme 3D Version (HQFS)"" together--they are both above-average selections for the field-sequential 3D systems.  There is also a movie called Santa vs. the Snowman in this format (HQFS) available here,",1124236800,5,667,5.08256880733945
8046720,4,B0007CHPPY,"This is not the coming at ya kind of video, but the picture has depth and explains how the shutter glasses work in 1985.  Nothing offensive.  Mild stuff, but enjoyable.

8046721,4,B0007CHPPY,This is the first 3D film played at IMAX and the field sequential version works very well but if you have a Sensio processor then the Sensio version should definatly be in your collection.,1110240000,4,188,4.5588235294117645
