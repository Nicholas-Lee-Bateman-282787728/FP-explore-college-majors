7885354,4,6305211183,"A pretty good documentary, although still, there is yet to be the treatment of David Lynch that we want.",1416268800,,104,4.526315789473684
7885355,5,6305211183,"This is an interesting documentary that isn't so much about David Lynch's films, it's more of a biography and then we learn a little about his film making process. It also talks alot about his paintings, furniture and other things like that. It was made during the filming of Lost Highway so there are interviews with many cast and crew members. I'd say that this is for hardcore Lynch fans only.",1156464000,,396,4.591549295774648
7885356,3,6305211183,"Pretty As A Picture is an 80 minute documentary focusing on America's most original director, David Lynch. And while it was somewhat interesting in spots(the clips of his early short films were pretty neat), as a Lynchaholic, I was hoping for something a little more in depth. While it spends a lot of time talking about Lost Highway, Lynch's other films(The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, TV's Twin Peaks) are only brushed over slightly. Wild At Heart, winner of the Palm D'Or for whoever cares, was barely mentioned if at all. For my money, I'd go with the 80 minute documentary on the Blue Velvet Special Edition DVD. Yes, it focuses mostly on Blue Velvet, but it is far more informative and interesting than Pretty As A Picture. I just think that a brilliant filmmaker like Lynch deserves a much better documentary. That's my two cents.",1042243200,17,836,4.772413793103448
7885357,4,6305211183,"yes, David has 'genius' hair...spikey, going in at least 5 different directions, when untamed...what joy to behold!
anyhow, I found this to be an enjoyable glimpse into Lynch's work (as much of a glimpse as I think we're going to get from the strange and media shy guy).
Most striking to me was the portrait of his artwork and his creation of it...I think this speaks most directly to his film work, since as his ex-wife put it, he wanted to make 'art that moves', and I'd purchase any of it (if I could afford it) in a second!
The discussion of his filmwork is rather shallow, but it's the interviews by people such as Peggy Lynch, Jack Fisk (longtime childhood friend), and his kids that light up this piece (Austin Lynch sounds *exactly* like David, with the midwestern twang and the long, slow deliberation with which he speaks). The Jay Leno interview is priceless ('they were sugar ants, but I think they were coming in for water...'), but, overall, if you're looking for what makes Lynch 'tick', you won't really find it here, but it's worth watching if you're a fan.",1034812800,2,1074,4.598958333333333
7885358,5,6305211183,"Ideas are the best thing going. That's what David Lynch says in the interview on this DVD.
This is a great overview of David Lynch.. It provides some good insight into his history interspersed with interviews with his ex-wife, his children, Mary Sweeney, Barry Giford and many others.
As a Lynch fanatic, I find this documentary exemplary. The best part by far is the interview with Lynch himself, who does not give interviews very often. You get a real sense of what a cool dude he is. Aside from the fact that his art stands on it's own, it is interesting to watch this documentary and learn that David Lynch is just an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things. To me, that in and of itself is inspiring.",993772800,13,705,4.559055118110236
7885359,5,6305211183,"This is an excellant look at the artistic works of director/painter & photographer David Lynch. Most of the footage was taken during the making  of the film Lost Highway. There are looks at most of Lynch's films,  photographs & paintings; plus plenty of interviews with Lynch's  associates like Jack Nance, Jack Fisk, Mel Brooks & Barry Gifford. An  excellant look at the works of this brilliant director. The DVD is well put  together, with the menus nicely presented with running segments of Lynch's  films. The picture and sound are both very good; the sound is particularly  good during Lynch's trip to Prague, where the Angelo Badalamenti music is  great. The extras are some extra interviews that were not on the video  version, and also some photos of Lynch during various stages in his life. A  must own DVD for fans of this magnificent director.",967075200,3,854,4.868055555555555
7885360,5,6305211183,"Comprised mostly of footage and interviews shot during the making of ""Lost Highway,"" this excellent documentary provides a fascinating peek inside the world of the master filmmaker and his entourage of collaborators.  Besides some amusing anecdotes from David himself, there's chats with his ex-wife Peggy, his children (including budding director Jennifer Lynch), his friend Jack Fisk, editor Mary Sweeney, producer Mel Brooks, writer Barry Gifford, actor Dean Stockwell, and ""Eraserhead""/""Twin Peaks"" almuni Jack Nance and Catherine Coulson.  We also hear from the cast members of ""Lost Highway,"" as well as learn the stories behind some of Lynch's characters (Bob, The Log Lady, Frank Booth, Mr. Eddy). Some of the more illuminating moments come when the focus shifts to his non-film projects, including some great footage of him working with composer Angelo Badalamenti and singer/violinist Jocelyn Montgomery (billed as Jocelyn West) on the unreleased track ""And Still."" His bizarre multimedia paintings are discussed, and there's a visit to a gallery show of his photography. He also created all of the furniture used in ""Lost Highway."" and we see a showcase of the odd tables and shelves he's made. This DVD edition outshines the shorter VHS version, with additional footage (and some Twin Peaks coverage) plus nice menu screens featuring clips from ""Eraserhead,""""Lost Highway,"" and his two early short films ""The Grandmother"" and ""The Alphabet."" All in all, any fan of the man's movies will want to check this one out. It's an interesting and inspiring portrait of a real American iconoclast.",952041600,22,1600,5.396
7885361,2,6305211183,"A behind the scenes look at the various products of David Lynch. Sounds interesting enough, but alas! this movie is no more than a mixture of Lynch-at-work footage, an all-too brief look at his work as a sculptor and  an incomplete survey of his pictures. How is it possible that there is no  mention of Lynch's absolute masterpiece 'Twin Peaks' in this documentary??  The 'Eraserhead' cast reunion is a unique display of dullness; a bunch of  old actors visiting their former dwellingplaces. If you want to find out  how exactly Lynch shot the prison scene in 'Lost highway' (better watch  that movie again!), you have to take a look at this. However, people who  know all about Lynch nd people who know nothing at all about him, may both  get disappointed. Better luck next time.",925171200,8,781,4.733333333333333
