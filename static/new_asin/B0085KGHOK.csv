Dont lie to yourself, Corey's vocals are not good anymore. The concert is excellent quality with terrible music. And the ""full length film"" is only 30 minutes long and boring to watch. I loved Your Nightmares Our Dreams, I loved Goat, and I loved the DVD that came with the special edition of All Hope Is Gone. But this... Is hard to watch. I gave this 3 stars for excellent quality music videos, and the making of snuff was cool. On some songs, I can also admit that Corey's new vocals are for the better. But not the old ones. My advice?

The sound and picture quality makes you feel like you were there in the middle of the crowd with them. The only complaint I really have is the show itself isn't long enough. The bonus features, though interesting, but seem like they go on longer than the actual show itself. Hopefully, they will rectify this the next time they decide to do another one of these.

5133348,5,B0085KGHOK,"Bands today are actually spending significant money to make decent concert DVD's and it's starting to show.

The band RUSH has mastered the ability to market and retail themselves via these concert DVD's.

Anyway, this is a balls to the wall rocker of a DVD.

The camera work is decent. At the beginning of the video, many in the crowd have these flags on long poles that block the view of the band. The camera crew must have realized this because by the forth song all the flags were gone. Other than that, camera work was good with good angles, views, well centered and steady.

I thought the sound was well mixed with everyone well represented.

This DVD is a straight-forward concert just as would be if you were physically there. I REALLY appreciate that... No self-gratifying interviews, cartoons or silliness mixed within the concert footage.

There's a bonus section that contains features such as, music videos and some interviews. The typical stuff found on every other music DVD you buy today.

Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.

5133350,4,B0085KGHOK,"I am not a fan of Slipknot music. I like some of them songs. I like heavy metal and bought recently Iowa and Vol 3.
I am 54 years old (yes!) and listen to music since 1970.
I saw some years ago the DVD ""Disasterpiece"" and was impressed by the show.
I bought here in Brasil these Blu-ray last week, an it has an excellent video quality, but I don't know what to say about the sound. I think it is honest because of the kind of music Slipknot plays.
If I compare the sound with the Blu-ray of Jeff Beck (2008 Live at Scott) or Snakes and Arrows (Rush), of course the Slipknot has a confusion sound, but in the context of the show the sound  is good.
Too tell the true, the bass's sounds of  drums are very clear, but the guitars have a digital sound. The bass guitar I couldn't hear, it is lost in the wall of sound.
Too much energy and too much visual! Great guys !!!",1356998400,,866,4.02906976744186

5133355,5,B0085KGHOK,"First off, I'm a 47 year old male.  I LIKE these guys, but I'm certainly no ate-up, hardcore maggot.  It's just that, there are days where I have an itch and these guys are the cure to what ails me.  To me, they're hit and miss.  Some of their CDs are great, some aren't so hot.  The same goes with their DVD's.  ""Behind the nine"" was, IMHO, a miss.  Great interviews, but I wanted music, not art.  ""DISASTERPIECES"" was a hit.  Honestly, I didn't think they could top that.  It had what I wanted.  BUT........this one, (sic)nesses, is top-shelf stuff.  Being an outdoor concert, I didn't expect too much.  I was wrong.  The camerawork is excellent and very clear.  Good angles and pan shots.  But, what REALLY impressed me, was the SOUND. I appreciate a good mix on a concert DVD, but it's usually too much guitar, or too much audience.  This one is spot on.  Not only can you HEAR Joey and his ridiculously fast feet, but you can FEEL them.  If you have any sort of surround system with reasonable subs, you WILL irritate the neighbors.  This one is a 'must have', whether you're a hardcore fan or not.",1317945600,3,1103,4.393034825870647

5133360,5,B0085KGHOK,"First, let me say that I am not going to really talk about the bonus disk.  As far as I'm concered, only the live concert footage is important, and that is what you are paying your $20 for.

With that being said, this DVD is incredible!  In front of 80,000 fans, Slipknot - the worlds greatest metal band, at the peak of their career so far - play the best songs from all four of the studio albums.

The band does an amazing job playing, and in my opinion this concert is way better than the Disasterpieces DVD, and maybe a little bit better than the 9.0 live C.D.

The track list (18 songs) is just about perfect on this album, even though they only play 3 songs from the ""All Hope Is Gone"" album.

And now to talk about the sound quality:

Like every rock concert, the sound quality and performance gets better as the concert goes on.  While the sound on the first song is a little ""off"" (but by no means bad sounding), by the fifth song - ""get this"", the band sounds awsome.

The balance between all of the instruments and vocals is just about perfect, although the vocals on the chorus of ""Sulfer"" could have been a little bit louder.  Mick and Jim's guitars are perfectly in-tune, tight, clean, clear, heavy and loud.  Even though Jim improvises some of his lead parts, they always fit in really good with the music.  Both Slipknot guitar players are virtuosos - they play perfectly even when they head-bang and go crazy - and this show is just another example of that fact.

Of course, there are some flaws in the drumming, but considering how difficult and fast some of these songs are, that is understandable.  If you are not a drummer though, you won't even notice these flaws.  As usual, Joey Jordisons playing is incredible, and even though the band actually speeds up some of their songs, he handles them very well.  I'll also mention that the snare drum marching band sections of ""The Blister Exists""  are amoung the highlights of the concert.  All three drummers sound very tight, and the pattern they play in that section is one of the coolest drum parts I've ever heard.

Corey Taylor does a very good job of singing and screaming in key, and re-creating acurately his vocal parts from the studio albums.  I actually think he sounds a lot better here than in the 9.0 live C.D.

So that's basically it.  If you have any interest in Slipknots music whatsoever, I don't think it would be possible not to be blown away by this concert.  Ignore what people say about the other disk.  You are paying $20 for an incredible live DVD with 18 awsome songs, and the contents of the second disk (actually pretty cool) are just free bonus features.

Buy this DVD right now (whether you are totally unfamiliar with Slipknot, or a hardcore fanatic) and you will not regret it.  What an adrenaline rush!",1297814400,,2803,4.479289940828402
5133361,4,B0085KGHOK,"coming from a true slipknot fan! this concert dvd could have had more songs! i was expecting snuff, all hope is gone, pulse of the maggots, etc. basically every big song that didn't make it on this concert dvd",1295913600,,209,4.384615384615385
5133362,2,B0085KGHOK,"Okay, we have another DVD from Slipknot, my favorite heavy metal band. The first disc is nothing more than live scenes from their tour spliced together. A complete waste. The second disc contains three different elements. Footage of the shoot of one of their videos, which is only moderately interesting. The second part is the videos from their latest CD. Outside of Psychosocial, I don't think their last effort was very good. Lastly, there is concert footage from a festival in London. I would have liked this better if it had been concert footage from a show in a relatively small arena, it would have a better feel to it. The good thing is that it was professionally done, and you get some great songs that were not on Disasterpieces. If you have Disasterpieces, I don't know why you need this one, other than to see songs like ""Before I Forget"" live.",1294790400,,856,4.6381578947368425
5133363,4,B0085KGHOK,"The performance was great, the editing fantastic, the mixing top notch, and this is by far the best representation of Slipknot live since Disasterpieces.  The features are strong and the backstage stuff is ... well, if you got the stomach for Clown's style of film making then you'll like it, otherwise you'll be bored and get little out of it.

So why bother reviewing this?  To say what I couldn't find others say: this isn't anamorphic widescreen (black bars at top and bottom of screen) and the audio is only 192 kbps.  What does this mean?  It means the audio and video quality is less than it could be, it means it won't look that good on widescreen TVs and it means that - never mind not releasing a Blu-ray for perfect quality - the DVD is subar by current standards.

Would that stop me from buying it again or should that stop you from looking at it?  No.  But when I bought it I thought ""who cares if it's not on Blu-ray, it'll still be the best sounding and best looking DVD they could have ever made and that will supersede all else.""  Wrong, and disappointing.",1293667200,,1074,4.411167512690355
5133364,5,B0085KGHOK,"This is a pretty good DVD, it's not as good as Disasterpieces but it is good. Definetly worth the money. The DVD includes 2 discs, Disc One containing the band's full performance at Download Festival 2009 in Donington, England in high quality. A kick ass performance. Expect the usual brutalness that make their setlist. Also includes music videos for ""Psychosocial"", ""Snuff"", ""Sulfur"" and ""Dead Memories"" and an interesting making of the ""Snuff"" music video. Disc Two includes a full length film directed by Clown (#6). The packaging has cool artwork and photography as well. Any Slipknot fan would appreciate this release.",1293235200,2,624,5.188118811881188
5133365,5,B0085KGHOK,"I think SlipKnot has grown a lot over the years, even crazier to think is they have grown with me (I was in high school when they first started, and a lot of them were teenagers themselves at the time) and the evolution has been amazing.

Through the years, many bands will come and go, most I won't like, a select few I'll enjoy for their uniqueness. SlipKnot has always been unique, what with Corey's amazing ability to go guttural and then actually sing all in the same song, Mickey's amazing Guitar skills, Joey's ability to godsmack you with Drum beats that rival the classic drummers (imo), and Paul's great talent for bass. Even clown, who seemingly does very little, adds atmosphere to songs with his way of drumming and beating beer kegs that has still not gotten old when its used in their stuff, and Sid- while more downplayed in newer songs- is a really good DJ.

There is a uniqueness to SlipKnot that is unmatched, but ever evolving. Like any good band, they have changed over the years, and while some cant acclimate to the change, and debates can be made, even that itself is a testament to the power of SlipKnot.

To me, watching the Download 2009 festival (having heard everything made public for the knot and a life long maggot) I feel this is the pinnacle of SlipKnot's work. Never has Corey seemed so on top of his game. While Corey is amazing, anyone that has seen a lot of live stuff from SlipKnot can tell you he has had a tendency to be less capable of keeping up with the songs in the past (which never hurt the concerts in my opinion) but in this show Corey showed a much more matured stage presence than ever before. I could speculate as to why, and I am glad he's taking better care of himself which may be a factor in his capabilities, but all that matters is this concert feels to me like one of the best things SlipKnot has ever done.

This DVD is great, and comes with all special features you'd maybe want, the concert is mind blowing (even better then the last DVD concert they released), and it comes with some newer videos for you to enjoy.

All in all, this is a SlipKnot fan must have.

So far so good. If you're a fan... then this dvd has it all.
Great quality in standard def. I think a lot of fans are waiting
on blu ray,but I think this transfer is up to par.
  I only paid $15.00 @ FYE W/ my discount ,which is a little
better than Amazon as of this writing.
  This live concert dvd will be in my rotation for a long time.

5133370,3,B0085KGHOK,"No 5.1 sound and no Blu-ray version?!, Common, let's be realistic here, that's a BIG let down!. Slipknot has all the resources to make an outstanding new live video as Disasterpieces was, it's 2010!, As many of you I love Slipknot and I was expecting something like Disasterpieces. This could have been something huge but it's not, and people who give this 5 stars are the ones with no quality opinion and only review the item from a blind Slipknot fan side of view.",1288915200,2,466,4.559523809523809
5133371,5,B0085KGHOK,"Being a fan of the group since 2000 and seeing them live twice I was really looking forward to this product coming out.  In my mind they are one of the few bands that brings great energy to any live show they play.  This DVD is great for any fan of the band that likes live music.  I like the set they play on the disasterpieces DVD better just because they only had two CD's out at that point and it was much more heavy, but I have grown with the band so this by no means is a let down or anything.  Great live crowd, and great to see them get top act at the Download Fest.  This DVD also contains all the videos from All Hope Is Gone and a behind the secens movie made by Clown that last's about 90 mins.  The only downfall is that is not in shot Blu-ray but that can not take away my five star rating from a great show put on by a great band.",1288656000,,845,3.8275862068965516

I mean come on Amazon a big company such as yourself can't afford at least UPS?  But overall I got the DVD in great, brand new condition.  The disc wasn't scratched, the booklet was in the case, everything was in order.  Now the DVD itself was more than I could ever ask.  This is a DVD every metal fan should have.  I wouldn't recommend Amazon site to everyone, but hey if your cheap on money it's better than buying from FYI.",1288396800,,562,4.398058252427185
5133374,5,B0085KGHOK,"Most Slipknot fans won't need very much convincing, a new live DVD has been released an you very probably plan t buy it, but for anyone on the fence about whether or not to get it, I highly recommend this package, on is own merits and not just out of blind dedication to the band.
`(sic)nesses,' is a pretty great package, documenting their 2009 headline performance at the UK's Download Festival in front of 80,000 excited fans. Also included is a documentary (curiously on disc one, with the concert on disc 2) from Shaun `Clown,' Crahan and all the music videos from the band's `All Hope Is Gone,' album cycle.
Performance wise, everything you expect to happen at a Slipknot concert is there, so don't expect to be disappointed in that regard. One can expect to see people hanging off things, jumping off things and throwing things at regular intervals; in addition to a spinning in mid air drum kit, Different band members fretting the notes for the guitarists, different band members hitting a keg with a baseball bat, Clown and Criss's strap-on marching drums during `The Blister Exists,' and `Psycho Social,' and of course Sid getting into the midst of everything, including the crowd whenever possible.
Without a doubt the entire concert is made on the strength of the crowds passionate reaction and that undefinable live energy that just makes the concert feel amazing. Seeing 80,000 plus people singing along to very heavy music is almost life affirming.
If you were dissapointed by the band's live performances on their live album `9.0 Live,' or the bonus live material from `Voliminal,' specifically the mix, Corey's vocals and the disjointed feeling caused from material being taken from various concerts and are unsure whether or not to buy `(sic)nesses,' then I'd like to reassure you that it is of a much higher quality than the previously mentioned releases, the whole concert is much more impressive and intense, Corey's vocal performance is noticeably stronger and the mix is a lot more suitable.
The audiovisual quality of the release is in absolutely no question, the tech crew behind it have done an absolutely sterling job recording, mixing, filming and editing it and the whole viewing experience is of as high a quality as you would expect from a band of Slipknot's size, even considering that this was a festival performance which is where a lot of big bands release their weaker DVDs due to the reduced amount of control available. Put simply this DVD looks and sounds fantastic, better even than you'd expect.
The only negative things I have to say are mere nitpicking, such as a perceived shortage of material from the `Iowa,' album and that the documentary is very much in the Shaun Crahan style (as seen on the main Voliminal film and the All Hope is Gone bonus DVD) which I don't personally care for but of course, you could indeed love this style. These minor and circumstantial niggles do nothing to detract from the sheer quality of the release. It may sound cheesy, but `(sic)nesses,' proves why people love Slipknot so much.",1288137600,2,3061,4.865900383141763
5133375,1,B0085KGHOK,Still the same decent stuff as before with new cory taylor solo influenced newer songs.,1286668800,,87,4.866666666666666
5133376,5,B0085KGHOK,"Is this a Slipknot DVD or a flag waving contest???? yes sarcasim, lowest form of wit.
10/10 for the show, (however the flags were distracting and covered up some intense shots of Corey & the band, before they tore Download a new a**hole with a blistering (sic)).
Fantastic performance. Coreys voice is in top form, and the shenanigans from the band members are a highlight. (Especially Clown when he picks up a keg and throws it at Craig).
Documentary is so, so. Film clips and the making of Snuff were interesting, nothing like seeing the lead singer of a metal band shaving his legs.
Highly recommended for Slipknot fans who are sick of watching live clips on you-tube, or have played Disasterpiece to death.",1286236800,4,710,4.733870967741935
5133377,5,B0085KGHOK,"here is a comparison of the two: Disasterpieces is more brutal, the editing is way faster and the visual experience is stimulating, plus the DVD has more features. we all know Disasterpieces is a Masterpiece, how could they top it? you might be skeptical. well, this is Sicnesses. sicnesses is technically better, the nine layers of music is more tightly knit together, everything blends together better, and the sound is excellent. this is more no-nonsense, basically what your getting is one amazing concert. the footage you've seen may have been from the web-cast, trust me, the sound is WAY better on the actuall DVD, that includes the vocals, there was an echo on the web cast that is not on the DVD, the vocals are excellent when u hear them on the DVD. this is just as good then as disasterpieces. the two dvd's work for different moods, want the most brutal concert? watch disasterpieces, want a techinically superior concert? watch sicnesses. its sooooooo good.",1286236800,8,970,4.884848484848485
5133378,5,B0085KGHOK,"First off i read a few reviews before the release of this dvd and I'm shocked that so many people bashed this release because its not offered on Blu-ray my first reaction from this is so what!!! I mean honestly folks Blu-ray is sweet don't get me wrong but the picture and quality on this disc is not far from it i have a Blu-ray disc player so its kinda near HD but it doesnt really matter to me. I love this dvd set it reminds me when i saw Slipknot for the first time back on the Mayhem fest 2 years ago at VA Beach and one word to describe that show: BADASS!!! They are without a doubt the best live band out there well I take that back I would put them 2nd behind the legendary Metallica nobody and i repeat nobody can top those guys ever they are true icons!! But with this awesome dvd you get the whole live performance in Donington Park, England which they rocked the arena big time!! You get 18 live songs including some personal favorites like Duality, Wait and Bleed, Before I Forget, Surfacing, Psychosocial etc. And if this wasn't good enough 4 music videos and the making of one of them Snuff and a full-length film that is dedicated to the late great bass player Paul Gray R.I.P.This dvd set is def worth it if your a maggot or a big metal fan go out and buy this dvd you won't regret it I can honestly say when i saw these guys in concert 2 years ago i feel lucky that i got the chance because bottom line Slipknot is a great band full of very talented musicans so do yourself a favor a pick this up!!",1285804800,4,1517,4.111111111111111
5133379,4,B0085KGHOK,"This DVD release from Slipknot is a great item for Slipknot fans. The live show - Live @ The Download Festival in 2009 - is fantastic. Possibly the best audio I've ever heard on a standard-DVD concert from Slipknot. The set-list has material from all 4 albums, so the mix of songs goes from about as hardcore as Slipknot gets to some ballad-type songs. All in all, there's 17 songs performed in front of 80,000 people, and it makes the DVD worth the purchase if you are a fan.

The 'Full-length Film', ""Audible Visions,"" is actually only about 35 minutes long, with abstract clips from on-stage clips to backstage shots. Anyone who is familiar with Clown's style of film will already know that you are in for a lot of abstract moments woven together to make a chaotic atmosphere. The film isn't bad, it's just not amazing or anything. Nevertheless, with the live show included, I consider the ""movie"" an extra feature, as well as the videos from the album ""All Hope Is Gone"". I wasn't as into ""All Hope Is Gone"" as much as other Slipknot fans, so the videos weren't anything too special to me, but for fans who love that album, there's another incentive to buy this.

Overall, I'm glad I bought this DVD. And for other reviewers that are giving this release 1 star reviews because it isn't available on blu-ray, that's really not what your review should be about. It should be about the material contained within the release. On that basis, I give ""(sic)nesses"" 4 stars.

So, I was really happy to see this DVD coming.  This is their performance at the 2009 Download festival.  This is easily one of the best Live DVD's that you will ever see.  There's really not much more to say about it.  If you're even a casual Slipknot fan, seeing them in their element, doing what they love to do and excel at is simply incredible.  I'm not really sure what the people giving it low ratings just because it's not Blu-Ray is all about.  First of all, you havn't seen it.  You're whining and giving a review/rating based on format.  Are you people really so brainwashed by popular culture that you can't even buy a concert disc of one of your favorite bands, just because it isn't the latest and *supposedly* greatest?  Sorry, I've done the Blu Ray-DVD comparison, and I don't understand the hype anyway.  Someone said ""Don't buy this and make a statement.""  Make what statement?

Now...to the DVD. I was anticipating this and had checked some clips from the show on YouTube. It really shows the poor quality video/audio recordings people upload there. I was a bit skeptical but when it came in the mail a couple days ago, i threw it in and WOW. What a show. Nice setlist and the video and audio quality is superb. Great stage show and presence as well. Another great live DVD from the Slipknot guys. I'll definitely watch this plenty of times. HIGHLY recommended.",1285545600,2,793,4.671428571428572

There is no reason why this can't be shot in HD. Yea ok, so if it came out on Blu ray, people will bash it for not being up to PAR with other Blu ray concerts. It's hard to win either way. But I can't see there being as many problems than if it was just a cheap Blu ray release. Chimaira's recent CD/DVD release was shot in HD. It isn't blu ray, but it looks nice for a chimaira concert. Good enough.

Someone over there has everything shoved so far up Corey Taylors rear end, there's no Stone Sour concert DVD's, Disasterpieces hasn't been released on Blu ray, now this... whats the problem?
