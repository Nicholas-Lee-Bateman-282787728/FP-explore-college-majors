7865931,4,6304234864,"This film isn't up to the ""Bride with White Hair"" but its still worth your time. Brigitte Lin is positively riveting in the title role. The story moves along with a surprising zip and never really lags. Brigitte Lin has a commanding screen presence and carries the entire film.",994204800,3,277,4.673469387755102
