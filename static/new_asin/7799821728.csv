1119077,1,7799821728,"well NBC should be taken to court for false advertisement. firstly the actual running time is NOT as stated on the box 4 hours but 3 hrs. 25 min. that is not a MINOR error.
second the full opening is N shown. we do get the ultimately boring march of nations, which quite frankly I could have done with out or maybe 10 min of that would suffice, but why have that in lieu of the FULL and awesome opening acts. it is a shame and a rip off.
So title is false too, it is NOT the full opening.
I would say tech quality of DVD is excellent.",1224720000,18,534,3.908256880733945

7900012,5,7799821728,Very good. I enjoyed it. I just wish they could have told what was happening.  Other then that it was great. I was a beautiful part of history. It had the whole opening and closing which I was very happy about.,1361318400,,210,4.121951219512195

7900015,1,7799821728,"Make sure you purchase the NTST version if in the USA. Despite claims there was NO COMMENTARY except for 3 5second intros to dignitaries. I recorded the ""Opening Ceremony"" live from the TV and it gave the history and background for each of the spectacular events. Just seeing large scale events looses the unbelievable depth of preparation for this 300,000 million dollar they spent on the opening ceremony. This video was exactly like watching a silent movie. ONE SUPER THING.  Amazon was very understanding and supportive about my ""concern"" about the cost to value. eBay has some for sale for twelve dollars.  And, if you Watch the silent first DVD, throw away the second and ignore the first half of the third DVD (nothing but contestants walking in) it is worth the twelve dollars",1232064000,10,784,4.843283582089552
7900016,4,7799821728,"The DVD's box states its NTSC Regions 3 and 6. I was able to play it with no problems in my Region 1 DVD player. The picture certainly isn't high def quality, but seeing as we were unable to watch the complete opening and closing ceremonies, its better than nothing. Sound was OK too. For the quality of the picture, I think $49.99 is a bit pricey, but this is also the only set that is NTSC and has both the opening and closing ceremonies. The NBC version does not include the closing ceremony, so that's why I didn't buy theirs. There is also another version out there that has both ceremonies, but most of the reviews I found said that it wasn't compatible with NTSC Region 1. So that's why I chose this version.

The menu allows you to choose english or cantonese. There is no commentary, just introductory titles for some of the major scene changes. Although I didn't want the full commentary from NBC, we did find that some commentary would have been helpful in understanding what was being illustrated in the opening ceremonies with the scroll thing etc. But you can't have everything! Overall, we are very satisfied with our purchase.

Purchased from Chinese Book Source. Their response to my email questions was prompt, although not as complete as I would have liked. Rocket fast shipping in time for Christmas. I bought this as a Christmas present, so ended up having to open it now to make sure it would work, so that was kind of a drag, but will explain the reason to my giftee on Christmas day.",1229126400,16,1507,4.516483516483516
