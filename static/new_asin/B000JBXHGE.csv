8149395,5,B000JBXHGE,"Finally, the whole Avengers collection in one set.

Sophisticated, extremely British, and totally surreal, with an unmistakeable 1960s flavour: The Avengers lasted many years for a reason.

The early Honor Blackman episodes are interesting, but image quality is rather poor, and the episodes are rather slow.
Subsequent black and white and then colour episodes with Diana Rigg are fascinating, under every aspect.",1402444800,,413,5.645161290322581
8149396,4,B000JBXHGE,i purchased this item as a christmas gift for a friend.  im too young myself to remember the show but my friend use to watch it when it was on tv i believe it was friday nights or saturday mornings.  anyway even though it came after christmas my friend was totally thrilled with this completed set and now is planning show nights where we both can just hang out for a few hours to chill and watch classic tv shows.  i love tv shows that were on tv before i was born and just from reading the back covers im pretty sure the Avengers is going to become one of my classic tv favorites.,1231459200,3,582,4.087719298245614
8149397,4,B000JBXHGE,"After reading several books on the Avengers TV series I was interested to see what the Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson era episodes were like. Now that I've seen a few, I understand why the Diana Rigg episodes are the only ones to ever be shown on local TV. They're simply the pick of the series.

The early Honor Blackman episodes have a very low budget feel about them, not only compared to the later Rigg episodes, but also to other B/W TV series from the time, such as the early Saint episodes. (I'd highly recommend The Saint DVD collection - even the first episode has a quality feel about it) They're of interest to anyone who wants to see where the series started, but overall they've dated very badly I think. If you compare a Honor Blackman era Avengers episode to the movie Goldfinger it's like they're made in different decades - the difference in production couldn't be greater.

On the other hand, the Tara King Avengers episodes are better produced, but simply the spark that the TV series had when Diana Rigg was in it just isn't there. It feels like the series by then was starting to live on borrowed time - the scripts are ok but the chemistry really isn't. And Steed driving a vintage Rolls Royce also was a bad choice - not tough enough for a secret agent, too dainty. The Bentley from the previous series was much better.

Given the cost of buying the complete DVD collection, I'd recommend unless you're interested in seeing what the Honor Blackman or Linda Thorson episodes are like, I'd buy the Emma Peel megaset instead. The B/W and color Diana Rigg episodes are by far the most entertaining and best filmed episodes of the series - the other episodes just aren't as good.",1198108800,19,1699,4.545751633986928
8149398,5,B000JBXHGE,"It took me almost 4-5 months to get this, but boy, oh boy, was it worth the wait!
First I was sent an incomplete set, and Amazon would not send the remaining items, but asked me to return the product, and promised to send a replacement, which took a really long time as the product was back-ordered and all.

Anyhow, there is no product description here, so I think I should mention what you get in the set:
