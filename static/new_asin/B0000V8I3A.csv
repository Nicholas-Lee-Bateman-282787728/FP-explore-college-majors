8003490,5,B0000V8I3A,"This DVD includes a documentary (by Walter Forbes) and two concerts. Back in 1945, a group of teenagers started playing bluegrass. For nearly six decades, The Dismembered Tennesseans have continued their love for performing that music that has taken them to festivals, fairs and little concert appearances around the country. That's a pretty amazing history! The group has shared stages with top country music stars. Based in Chattanooga, the Tennesseans have performed with the city's Symphony Orchestra, Boys Choir, and Ballet. Television appearances have included ABC's Nightly News with Peter Jennings and NBC's Sunday Today Show.

McCallie High School was the site where Fletcher Bright, Ansley Moses, and the late Frank McDonald (1930-2000) first formed the band just after the end of World War II. While bandmates have come and gone, real estate developer Fletcher Bright continues as the group's fiddle player, manager and pilot today. How many bands can boast their own pilot who transports them on tours throughout the Southeast? Retired bank vice-president and former Mayor of Lookout Mountain, Ansley Moses is another original member of the Dismembered Tennesseans who sings and plays various instruments. Banjoplayer Ed ""Doc"" Cullis is a retired orthodontist. Joining the band several years ago, Laura Walker sings and plays the upright bass. Other band members include Bobby Martin (guitar, vocals) and Don Cassell (mandolin, vocals). Fletcher's son, George, plays guitar with the Fletcher Bright Fiddle Band and is involved with production of The Dismembered Tennesseans' recordings and shows.

Filmmaker Walter Forbes (formerly CEO for Signal Thread) was impressed by the endurance and longevity of this band. He was also fascinated by the three musicians' friendship over the course of 60 years. The documentary took a year and a half to complete. Band members tell their stories through interviews, informal narratives and unique concert footage, some dating back to 1975. From Nashville, John Greer directed, cowrote the script, and edited the film. Available in both DVD and VHS formats, this product can be purchased at various Chattanooga locations as well as on-line at Amazon.com and [...]. With over two hours of concert footage, the DVD is an enjoyable curio. It's special to have an entertaining documentary about a bluegrass band with such a memorable history.

8003491,5,B0000V8I3A,"This is a wonderful documentary featuring my favorite bluegrass band. The narration is suberb and the historical background of the band is very interesting and entertaining. The concerts are an added bonus to the delightful documentary. I especially love the band emcees, and Mr. Bright is the most awesome fiddle player that I have ever seen! Way to go Walter Forbes and John Greer! Here is to many more years of the best bluegrass ever!",1072915200,5,438,4.8533333333333335
