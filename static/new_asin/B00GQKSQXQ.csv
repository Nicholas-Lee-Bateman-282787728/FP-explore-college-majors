8626222,5,B00GQKSQXQ,"All of the McBride series episodes were good. They should have been released years ago on DVD. Hallmark has gone down the tubes. They don't even have a ""contact"" on their website, so nobody can reach them or ask them anything. I have never seen that before on any website? I wish I knew what happened to them? Hopefully, somebody will pick this series up someday and release it.",1522022400,,378,4.492753623188406
8626223,5,B00GQKSQXQ,"All ten of the Mcbride (John Larroquette) movies on hallmark are classic, the way of Jesse stone. Why don't you have all ten ready to purchased and off the shelf?",1493424000,,162,4.433333333333334
8626224,5,B00GQKSQXQ,"I enjoyed this this series and hope they release more than this one episode. This is about a former cop, turned defense lawyer with a young new lawyer as his assistant who take on a case, pro bono, that is a slam-dunk for the prosecurion.",1482278400,4,238,4.311111111111111

8626228,5,B00GQKSQXQ,"One of those Great LOST TV shows that should've been on major network or cable and had a long run. Larroquette is excellent as always
but this role is really one of his best other than the comedy series Happy Family that should've been a hit as well. I was lucky enough to
record those on video! This show I missed but someone I got rare tv movies from sent me 3 episodes on dvd for free a while back and
I think all three movies are great. This one on dvd is really good but the price is RIDICULOUS! I hope to find the rest of the episodes.
AND WHY ISN'T THE FULL 10 EPISODES RELEASED????",1418428800,6,589,4.042735042735043
8626229,4,B00GQKSQXQ,"Except for the Jesse Stone series (which rather stands in a class by itself), McBride is the best of the Hallmark Channel Mystery Movies.  Much of which can be attributed to the very able Mr. John Larroquette.
Obviously the TV public loves the -Perry Mason/Defense Attorney with innocent client format as exampled by numerous movies and TV Shows with that programing. So it becomes the worth of the plot or the actors portraying the attorney that puts one show above another; in this McBride has a worthy campaigner in Mr. Larroquette. Depending on which McBride you watch, the plot quality varies: from a good ""The Doctor Is In"" to a lesser plot story (in my prejudiced opinion) ""Requiem"". All though, are greatly aided by the loopy charm of McBride.  The supporting players, also, do a fine job of supporting. Marta Dubois is darling as McBride's love interest and put upon detective friend. Matt Lutz works well at attracting the under 30 watcher.",1397347200,11,950,4.8580246913580245

8626231,5,B00GQKSQXQ,This series is extremely well done and showcases Larrouquette in a new and interesting light.  Would LOVE to obtain all ten episodes.  Why are they not available yet?,1389312000,16,166,4.892857142857143
