2672080,5,B000JJ5G38,"This is an awesome DVD presentation of the entire 'Free to Worship' concert.  I feel as though I am there praising and dancing with Fred, Pam, and all the others on the set.  I really enjoy 'LOUD'.  I love the way Fred put together this video presentation.  It has some unique graphics in the video that makes it worth viewing.  I also enjoy, 'This is the day'... that 'Ol School Jam' with a Fred Hammond mix...  and all the others both fast and slow, its all the right beat for me.  The sound is so different on 'We've come to give him Praise'.  It almost has a Fred Flintsone harmony that sounds good in surrond sound stero.  Thanks Fred for never letting us down with the gospel praise sound.  I am not disappointed.  Also, loved the interview DVD, but I want more copies!  God Bless you.",1172361600,5,791,4.342465753424658
2672081,5,B000JJ5G38,"Awesome!  This is the Fred Hammond we came to know and love from Spirit of David.  RFC sounds great also.  I was truly blessed by the lyrics on songs like ""Simply Put"".  Hearing ""This is the Day"" Hammondized was great too.  This CD will have you dancing, as well as meditating on the goodness of the Lord.  Thanks again Fred for letting God use you.",1172361600,6,349,4.292307692307692
2672082,5,B000JJ5G38,This is a must have item. Superb and excellent concert. Fred Hammond is the best. Totally recommended.,1172016000,3,102,5.0588235294117645
2672083,5,B000JJ5G38,"This is a great DVD and must have for any gospel music and Fred Hammond fan. When I bought the album it came with a bonus dvd that had 3 songs from the DVD and I knew then I had to have it for my family. We watch/listen to this just about everyday. my 3 year old daughters LOVE it and always say ""I want to watch the new Fred Hammond"" like I said a must have and great.",1171238400,7,369,3.6835443037974684
2672084,5,B000JJ5G38,Fred does it again. Prepare for a worship experience whenever Fred releases a live DVD. Many of the new songs with a taste of old. Even Ruben Studdard is involved. As always the Lord is shinning through Fred.,1170806400,4,208,4.5
2672085,4,B000JJ5G38,"I have truly been blessed by this DVD. (but I am always blessed by anything Fred Hammond does:))I enjoyed the DVD. I love all the songs especially the way More of You and A Closer Walk were done! I was a little disappointed in the presentation of the DVD though. I guess I would have liked to see it flow better, I wanted to feel like I was at the recording instead of watching it. I was expecting what I saw on the Speak Those Things,Purpose By Design and Pages of Life DVD...but other than that no complaints about anything else! A huge blessing! I've been playing it non stop!! A must get!",1169510400,3,592,4.247787610619469
2672086,5,B000JJ5G38,"To this Live DVD, all I can say is WOW!!!
I tell you what, I haven't seen a Live production like this in ALL my life. Every song, every musician, every vocalist, every technical/ graphical director was on it on this one.
I have not one criticism. Just watching this DVD throughout was a special blessing, and I thank God that this DVD came into my life at a time when I needed a God-sent word the most.
Fred, keep ministering, your labour is surely NOT in vain.
THIS IS A TOTAL MUST BUY WHETHER YOU'RE SAVED OR DO NOT KNOW JESUS. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!
Be Blessed!!!",1169164800,3,577,4.254545454545455
2672087,4,B000JJ5G38,"If your looking for a well produced product that shows that Fred is a great gospel artist then this dvd is for you.

Everything is put together very professionally. The musicians and singers are very good.

the only cons about the dvd is:

1. there was no setting on the dvd to switch the sound to dolby 5.1.

2. They could have remixed the songs a lil better but I understand why they kept it pocket. Everyone doesn't know the songs yet.

Other then that this is a great dvd.. Pick it up.",1168387200,4,489,4.21505376344086
2672102,3,B000JJ5G38,"I thought that the video would be more like his past worship projects. The video was more like a trip through a few albums. The behind the scenes left a little to be desired. But on a whole I have to be fair, If I were not comparing it to his past works it would be a solid DVD...",1231632000,,280,3.76271186440678
2672103,5,B000JJ5G38,"I simply love Fred Hammond's latest Project. This video is energetic, exciting & lives up to what Fred Hammond is all about.

2672106,4,B000JJ5G38,"Only problem with this is that the video is not in sync with the music.  I wonder how long it took them to make it like that?

Music is great tho.  Bless God for Fred and em.",1193702400,,174,3.6486486486486487
2672107,4,B000JJ5G38,"The music is different from the other concert DVDs, but I got used to it. His music is really exciting and powerful.

HOWEVER, whoever edited and produced the DVD did a terrible job. It has LOTS of cheezy effects that an amatuer would use for a home made video. Lots of awkward transitions that gets distracting, and bad typography! I would love to see a scene for atleast 10-15 secs before moving onto another camera. err. Its worse than Israel Houghtens Live and From Another Level DVD...",1187568000,,490,4.632183908045977

purchased the DVD to see the whole concert.  I was not disappointed.",1178928000,,211,4.594594594594595
2672109,2,B000JJ5G38,"I guess I'm the only one who thinks that this is Fred's worst offering yet. I bought, got excited and got ready for an awesome experience. It never came.

The sounds was bad. Very bad. 'nough said!

The video had me feeling sea sick.

Fred has done much better on previous DVD so why did he sanction this one? Does he know about this DVD?

Sorry if it's just me.",1178841600,,362,4.128571428571429
2672110,5,B000JJ5G38,Very satisfied with shopping experience.  Quick delivery.  DVD is awsome!  My family has been admiring Fred Hammond for some time and they love to get together and view the DVD which leads us into an awesome worship experience.,1176163200,,227,4.921052631578948
2672111,4,B000JJ5G38,"I enjoyed this DVD.

The only thing negative:

The sound and video are not in sinc. There is an obvious delay. The fact that no one has commented on this in their review makes me wonder if I received a defective DVD.

Other than that, ""It's all Good""",1173312000,,250,4.166666666666667

8150691,5,B000JJ5G38,"Fred Hammond is a premiere artist.  He can cover traditional gospel as well as his own contemporary sound.  There seems to be no end to his talent.  All that talent and he always seems to keep the real purpose of his work, praising and worshipping God, in the forefront.
