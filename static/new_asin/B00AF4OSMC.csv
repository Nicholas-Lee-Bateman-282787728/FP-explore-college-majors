5414816,5,B00AF4OSMC,They don't make movies like this anymore that children can watch. It's in color and will entertain children from five or six on up. No harsh killing graphics. No objectionable language. Just an excellent western movie for young to old to watch!,1411948800,2,244,4.833333333333333
5414817,4,B00AF4OSMC,"This DVD from Hen's Tooth has very good audio/video and qualifies as exciting entertainment.  Jon Hall looks great.  One note:  This is a 1947 re-release from PRC.  This can be seen during the credits where one of the original cards is replaced by one which specifies PRC.  It was originally released by United Artists, whose name has been removed.  There is also a re-release trailer.",1383436800,2,385,4.846153846153846
5414818,3,B00AF4OSMC,"Kit Carson really isn't good enough -- but while on, and you can hear Randolph Scott in every word uttered by Jon Hall, and wish he were there, it still comes out okay. Dana Andrews and Lynn Bari top the supporting cast list but you will find many old friends like Raymond Hatton on the screen. I saw this as a child and liked it then. Still do, dramatic shortcomings notwithstanding.",1377475200,,384,4.422535211267606
5414819,4,B00AF4OSMC,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid.  It was always a personal favorite.  I'm glad it finally came out on DVD.  I still
enjoy watching it.  I recommend it for the older generation who remember when movies didn't contain computer generated
special effects.",1365465600,2,263,4.6521739130434785

5414821,4,B00AF4OSMC,"This is a movie I saw a lot on TV in my childhood and I remembered it vividly. I found watching it again to be a complete enjoyment and it was every bit as good as I remembered. Being a western film buff I remembered this movie especially because Clayton Moore had a supporting role in his pre- Lone Ranger days and it gave me my first look at his face without a mask. A thrill, indeed.",1363305600,3,386,4.025974025974026

8550774,3,B00AF4OSMC,"Typical of Hollywood westerns the film takes historical figures and puts them in a fictional story, this one worked well teaming Kit Carson (Jon Hall) and John Fremont (Dana Andrews) in a wagon train adventure as Carson takes a small wagon train to California and traveling with a calvary unit going there led by Captain John C. Fremont.  Toss in a love triangle with Lynn Bari and you have a better than a B western.  Add a pretty good bunch of recognizable character acters like Ward Bond, Raymond Hatton, and Harold Huber and you make it even better.  This was the first of Jon Hall's 9 westerns that featured him as the star and under the name Jon Hall.  Earlier he had done a John Wayne flick Winds of The Wasteland as Charles Locher.  Good trivia both Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels were in the movie - before becoming The Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Decent western and well worth a watch.",1428969600,,894,4.521739130434782
8550775,5,B00AF4OSMC,A real oldie but goodie.  The move has the first film Clayton Moore was in prior to The Lone Ranger.  It was a gift for my Aunt and she loved it so did I.  A great gift .,1414195200,2,170,3.4210526315789473
