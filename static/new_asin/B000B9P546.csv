This 1973 film is inspired by the latter.

Here, five men ride an elevator that unexpectedly goes beyond the lobby to a sub-basement. The doors open to a comfy lounge where they sit and take turns relating a disturbling dream. The movie is thus divided into five segments:

""Midnight Mass"" - Rogers (Massey) visits a town that shuts up tight at sunset because that's when ""they"" come out!
""The Neat Job"" - Crirchit (Terry-Thomas) drives his wife (Johns) berserk with his neat-freak ways.
""This Trick'll Kill You"" - Magician (J&uuml;rgens) will do *anything* to obtain an Indian girl's rope trick.
""Bargain in Death"" - A man (Craig) scams insurers by having himself buried alive while in suspended animation.
""Drawn and Quartered"" - Artist (Moore) visits a Haitian mystic and is given voodoo powers via his paintbrush.

Each of these stories ends in a macabre surprise. After all dreams are told, the elevator opens, the five ascend and we are treated to the final plot twist.
