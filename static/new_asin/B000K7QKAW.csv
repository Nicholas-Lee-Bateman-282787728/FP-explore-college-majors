8154609,5,B000K7QKAW,"Some simply stunning scientific finds in the rain forests of America's Southern Hemisphere revealing the shocking fact that there was an earlier classical Maya period that is a thousand years older than what we now consider the Mayan Classical Era. The reconstruction drawings of the El Mirador Pyramid Complex immense size and scale illustrates just how advanced these Guatemalan native people were at one time. The complete collapse of this great civilization, 1800 years before 1492 and Columbus, begs the question: What happened here?",1350086400,,538,5.416666666666667
8154610,5,B000K7QKAW,"National Geography made this wonderful story on Maya which was the culture and civilization of America.  It is amazing to learn of the Maya accomplishments and structures with ancient talent and craftsmanship in the absence of modern tools and education.  They had the power, skill and resources to make buildings established.

Contrary to the myth that Maya people were savages, they did develop sophisticated community compatible to other metro cities around the world.  Why Europeans come, conquer and destroy by burning their books and killing the priests of knowledge?  Mr Richard Henson was good in decoding and telling us Maya stories in hiss research.

With such popular program, we share, understand and appreciate native American culture and civilization.  The temples, pyramids and monuments are American wonders among Egyptian Pyramids and Great Wall of China.",1306022400,6,872,5.462686567164179
8154611,5,B000K7QKAW,"A group of archaelogist travel to El Mirador and visit the largest temple pyramid found called El Tigre, in Peten Guatamala. El Mirador was a trade center, pre-classic Mayan around 350 BCE to 150 CE. Mayan culture flourish in the 6th century BCE.  Another temple called La Danta was covered in lime.  La Danta is 230 feet above the forest floor and is one of the most massive man made structure on the earth, the base is 300 meters by 300 meters, 2.8 million meters of fill.  The Mayans had to burn thousands of acres of trees to make the lime to cover their temples.  The El Tigre complex is about 10 square miles.  The population could range from 80,000 (100 BC).

Corn was grown on stone terrace and material from the swamp was carried by thousands of workers too create the soil foundation to feed the people. Tons and tons of mud to build the terraces. They grew corn, squash, and beans.  The agriculture power allowed the Mayans to become an economic power.

The glyphs tell about the Mayan creation: the maze God descends to the underworld, he is killed by the underworld God and his head hung from a tree.  Two of his son travel to meet the Maize God and he is reborn ascending from the underworld into the dawn of day.

David Stewart deciphers one of the preclassic glyphs to mean king.

Richard Hansen thinks from evidence discovered at El Mirador that the Olmecs and Mayans developed their history separately. El Mirador was the first organized state in America called the Kan Kingdom made up of 26 cities.

Two theories exist for what happened to the Mayans at El Mirador: 1. War between civilizations 2. Deforestation caused soil erosion that lead to starvation.

Mayan reached the maximum population density between 350 AD and 900AD.

Lecture by Richard Hansen

PreClassic = 1600 BC to 150 AD
Classic=300-900 AD
Post Classic =900 - 1500 AD

80% of the sites found are associated with Classic and Post Classic era.

The Mirador Basin borders on Mexico and looks like a triangle.

The Mayan cities were built in the most inhospitable locations: swamps and forests.

26 major cities and 60 minor cities. Natsul, balabak, Naachtun (pyramids), El Mirador, Nakbe (600 to 400 BC), wakna, tintal,xulnal

Solidarity between the cities.

The forest is the same as the time of the Mayans.

Thousands of fires are burning and destroying the forests around the Mirador Basin

There still exists large causeways coming into the city of El Mirador

El Tigre pyramids have three summits, this pattern is called triad, consistent beginning 300 bc.

The huge causeways made the city a superpower, up to 30 kilometers long, 40 meters wide. The fill is a monumental effort.  The causeways linked the major cities together, a system of moving supplies and people and armies.

The buildings in the cities were carefully designed in an East West orientation.

8154612,5,B000K7QKAW,"I love learning things about the Mayas, or Aztecs.  However, too often documentaries just repeat all the same stuff.  This work was novel because it called the more familiar Mayan period ""classical"" and this focused on the centuries before, the ""pre-classical.""  It is emphasized that the buildings are writings discovered were before AD and comparable to the Ancient Egyptians.
This work interviews both Euro-American and Mexican scholars.  The work implies that much of what was found was done by serendipity, but I hope things were more calculated than that.  This work gives an explanation for a decline in the Mayan civilization and it has nothing to do with the arrival of the Spaniards.  Like Ancient Egypt, I wonder if the price for these ever-lasting monuments is a waste of resources for the people.
That wunderkind, Dave Stewart (not of Eurythmics fame) is in here, but he's gray-haired now.  I really think those who liked ""Apocalypto"" would get a kick out of this as well.",1264636800,9,985,4.969512195121951
