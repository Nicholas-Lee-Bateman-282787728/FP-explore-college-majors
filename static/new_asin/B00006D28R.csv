7967343,4,B00006D28R,"Once again, the sound isn't the best it can be, but at least this finishes the series and with some interesting stories. Six of the eight episodes are about WW2, with Superman helping in many ways. Another episode that I really enjoyed was about someone who robs banks pretending to be Superman. Overall, really good still with bad sound quality",1188864000,,345,4.766666666666667
7967344,3,B00006D28R,"Well, I have the ""sequel DVD"" to vs. Nature & War, Superman vs. Monsters & Villains. Now, I will admit the picture quality is quite a bit better than some I have seen, however, it could get a bit sharper. Also, from the first short I watched I was not pleased with the sound. For one, the mono soundtrack can be improved, and second, I don't like things added to the original. In a sense, it takes away from the vintage material and is not the same. Also at times, the mono soundtrack volume level is very low. If you're looking for the original, I don't suggest this too much. However, if you just want something to add to your collection or something for the kids to watch, this is not bad.",1060473600,,692,4.25
7967345,4,B00006D28R,"i bought both Superman vs. Monsters and Villans and Superman vs. Nature and War. not bad, and they are a slice of Americana, but the sound isn't very good.
the sound in the Batman cartoons remind me of high school, watching those movies in class on a reel. the cartoons are excellent, but again, sound is pretty shaky.
Look! in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's SUPERMAN!",1048636800,,378,4.414285714285715
7967346,1,B00006D28R,"Focusing primarily on the rarely-seen Fleischer/Famous Superman shorts from World War II (which, like most of the war cartoons produced under the Paramount banner, features the Japanese), this disc has about the best video possible for a public domain release of these classic cartoons. Problem is, this company has arrogantly decided to add their own sound effects in addition to (and sometimes over) the original soundtrack. What could be a reasonably affordable holdover until Warner Bros. restores the cartoons turns into a colossal waste because of the audio equivalent of graffiti. Additionally, the beginning of the final cartoon, ""Terror on the Midway"" is nothing more than a series of freeze frames, implying that the publisher didn't look too hard for a decent print. Definitely not worth buying.",1034380800,5,806,5.354330708661418
