8447202,1,B000HIP44W,"The episodes for Naruto are quality but in this case, due to errors in the description I can not recommend the DVD.  When I ordered the DVD, I made sure to check the language options of the DVD.  This one indicates that a Japanese language option is available.  Unfortunately this is incorrect.  If you do not mind this being an all english DVD with the television broadcast editting, than this is for you.  Naruto is not so far editted compared to other anime series that the series is hampered and the english actors do a relatively good job with the translation.  However, if you prefer the japanese version, this DVD is not for you.",1164585600,4,636,4.535087719298246
8447203,5,B000HIP44W,"This is where Naruto starts to get interesting. The first season is cool, but it's not til the Chunin exams that Naruto really starts to kick off. You get to see more of what chakra can do and meet an incredibly diverse cast of characters, learn more of the role of the hidden villages and the secrets they entail. Whether you prefer Japanese or English, Naruto is an anime for the ages.",1159056000,4,387,4.388888888888889
