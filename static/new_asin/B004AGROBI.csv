4309354,4,B004AGROBI,"I will state up front that I don't own the dvd but the vhs version of this film. I base my review on the movie's storyline. Yes, a plotline in a porn movie! The plot is thin I'll admit, but it is fun and the acting is surprisingly good. For this genre of movie I would verge on the word ""great"" but I will refrain.

The production is a 70's affair showcasing a suave, sex expert and his attempt at creating the ""next big thing"" in the world of sex queens. Definitely a different slant on the ""My Fair Lady"" theme. I have to applaud the cast: Constance Money, Marlene Willoughby, Gloria Leonard and Jamie Gillis because, as stated before, they all give excellent...ah, performances. By that, I mean acting although the sex bits were good as well. You have to remember this film was made over a quarter of a century ago. The swinging 70's. It's hard to tell if the hipsters were really down or they were playing up the camp. I think it's a little, (or a lot depending on how you look at it), of both but somehow it works for plain fun today.

This is a porn movie but by today's standards it seems incredibly tame. Although there are a couple of twists near the END that probably are still avant garde today. I won't give it away, OK? One of the more hilarious scenes is during the air travel sequences. Again, remember this is the 70's. Airliners were much more than the cattle cars of our contemporary world. And the pilot's wife...oh man, I won't give that away either.

Check this little ditty out for some times back when jet-setting meant something and international travel seemed the life the common man could never afford. Yes, their is plenty of sexual encounters but the banter is what adds so much more to this piece. Lastly, the music is pure 60-70's hipster. I'd love a soundtrack but it would be just too much to ask?",1277164800,2,1829,4.389380530973451
4309355,2,B004AGROBI,I saw this when it first came out in the 70s. Seeing it now is weird but sort of entertaining. I'm glad I didn't shell out too much cash on it.,1260835200,3,143,3.6451612903225805
4309356,5,B004AGROBI,"Remember a spaghetti dinner on lower Queen Anne and oysters at your place, Ms. J? I feel guilty about enjoying this, but I was so shy back then, and so were you. Still: I'll never forget it, nor that freaky Harry Wolfe we used to work for. (Did you ever get paid? Me neither!) A personally intriguing film and frankly it's rated as a classic for a good reason -- or ten, or more. You were once described as an ""enthusiastic amateur"" --- I strongly agree! But (sadly) only vicariously! Dated and naive, this is still the best erotic film ever made! (Well, except for ""The First Nudie Musical"", but I'd bet SJ would agree with me over that.) You had such a sweet smile and laugh! They show in this. Thanks for the memories, real or fantastic! I wish you all the best, always!",1238198400,,773,4.337931034482758

4309364,5,B004AGROBI,"One can see where this title is one of the most acclaimed Classics in the Adult Entertainment canon.  Jamie Gillis is the consummate actor.  He was a force with which to be reckoned.  This film is immensely impressive.  If Adult Entertainment were still producing movies of this quality now, in the early 21st Century, the Industry would be besting Hollywood by miles.  ""The Opening.  .  ."" features massive production values.  If the Adult Entertainment Industry lasts another thirty (30) years, we can only hope that it comes back around to this level of quality.",1412380800,5,565,4.9361702127659575

4309371,4,B004AGROBI,"This is a movie from the 70's, and as such, it was extremely ahead of its time in many ways.  One of the most noticeable things about the sex in this movie is the fact that all the actors'/actresses have lots of pubic hair in their private parts (not their underarms, ugh!).  There are a few nice dialogue sets, especially the one where the stewardess interviews the main character about what he wants on a plane trip.  They have a lot of fun with that.  There is one other scene on a plane that was kind of cute (but I only need one more minute scene).  I found the movie entertaining, but most of the sex was just head jobs.  Playboy did an article on this movie for either July or August (2014) that got me intrigued to buy the video.  You can't rent it (at least I couldn't find it online).  All in all, I think it was well worth the coins, and I mildly recommend the movie if you like porno.  The best part of the movie is the last major sex scene.",1403740800,12,953,4.108108108108108
4309372,3,B004AGROBI,"As it was said one of the best classic pornos, my expectation was probably too big.

4309379,5,B004AGROBI,"'The Opening of Misty Beethoven' (which I have just watched for the first time) is considered by some (or many) to be the greatest adults-only movie ever made.  I'd have to watch a LOT more to confidently agree or disagree but I can say that I liked it very much!  There is a story (which doesn't come across as a necessary evil) and would be extremely watchable in either the soft or hard core version, both of which are included on this Blu-ray.  It's really quite funny, too, with plenty of jokes and sight gags, all of which the performers deliver with ease and aplomb ...except for one lady in one of the aeroplane scenes, but she's pretty and it's only one line, hehe.  The music is appropriately whimsical and sexy by turns, and I now want the soundtrack!

This Blu-ray release has clearly been a labour of love for the producers, from the careful restoration and transfer of the movie to the packaging.  If you are interested in this movie or this period in adults-only entertainment, I think you will not regret buying this Blu-ray.  The movie itself is fully worth the money, but there are also some interesting and informative special features (many in high definition).  Of course, your primary reason for buying will be to enjoy watching some really good looking people making out!  ;)",1363219200,10,1298,4.657894736842105
4309380,5,B004AGROBI,"It is a miracle what 12 weeks of editing can do for a film! ""Misty Beethoven"" is widely considered the best porn movie ever made, and I can only agree.  It has class, it has style, and it is very well acted - especially by Jamie Gillis - and directed. It is the pinnacle of the brief moment in time known as 'porn chic'.  Everyone is glamorous, money is no object, and the sex is plentiful.  Most memorable are the many montage sections in the film, something I have never seen in another adult motion picture, and certainly not done with the style and skill as ""Misty Beethoven'.
Anything by Radley Metzger / Henry Paris is worth searching out, as he was the one true auteur of porn, but this film is the best of the best.  Additionally, no expense was spared in doing a complete audio / video restoration, with tons of bonus features and even a commentary by Mr. Metzger.  It looks great, it has great packaging and cover art, and it is perhaps the one great porn film.  A must buy, if you are interested in that kind of thing.",1361145600,18,1029,4.305699481865285
4309381,5,B004AGROBI,"The Opening of Misty Beethoven is widely recognised as the greatest porno film of all time, at least among those who care about the film aspects and not just the sex. It has an entertaining plot suitable for a porno, wonderful sets, a witty script gorgeous actors and actresses and is topped off by a great soundtrack. Not to forget about the sex: two scenes are really hot and the others all add to the overall experience. Distribipix's Blu-ray package truly does justice to the film: excellent transfer and superb special features including two versions of the film (hard and soft) with two separate commentaries. Fans are well rewarded and anyone new to the movie will be instantly enraptured by it.",1357257600,29,702,4.809917355371901
4309382,5,B004AGROBI,"I am absolutely blown away by the love and care that DistribPix put into their restoration of THE OPENING OF MISTY BEETHOVEN.  The aspect ratio has been restored, so that you are seeing the film as you would have seen it in the theatre.  And the colors, dialog and music all look and sound the best that they possibly could.  The extras are nonpariel -- you get featurettes on the actors, a behind-the-scenes documentary, the complete story of the music used in the film (without equal in the annals of adult cinema), deleted scenes and much more.  If you've only seen the subpar DVD made from a VHS tape, you owe it to yourself to see the film as ""Henry Paris"" intended.  And while you're at it, don't forget to pick up a copy of the stupendous soundtrack CD!",1356825600,28,760,4.438848920863309
4309383,4,B004AGROBI,"The Opening of Misty Beethoven(1976) is a cult classic of the 1970's Porno Chic genre. It's a loose remake of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. It stars Jamie Gillis and Constance Money. It has good camerawork, good production values, and some well chosen stock music cues. Distribpix did a good job restoring the film and packing the DVD and Blu Ray's with extra features. The soft core version of The Opening of Misty Beethoven is also an extra. Two deleted scenes from Misty Beethoven were used as filler in Barbara Broadcast(1977) and Maraschino Cherry(1978). The Opening of Misty Beethoven is a classic adults only film from Henry Paris.",1355529600,18,641,5.0
4309384,1,B004AGROBI,"We found this movie to be boring and a turnoff. Lots of fully dressed females pleasing men. Even the ""opening"" of Misty was anticlimactic. Complete waste of time and money.",1354665600,4,172,4.766666666666667
4309385,5,B004AGROBI,"Ive loved this movie, since i first saw it 20 years ago and have had it on vhs in all this time. Now a new dvd edition of this classic is being released this Saturday.

4309387,5,B004AGROBI,"I  was going through  a  filing cabinet and found my  VHS  copy of "" The Opening of Misty Beethoven. This  video is a  classic. we ( my lover and I ) enjoyed it
thoroughly many times. At  first when it was  still in theaters  we  would make  the  25 mille drive  there,again and again. We  were lucky because the place
we went to had  many screens,and every night for years at 9:00 they devoted one of them exclusively  to  "" Misty "". Though we often saw familiar  faces,many
of them were couples, we always had a good time ,only  the drive  home  seemed to take forever. Then something  wonderful happened. "" Misty "" became
available on VHS .So of course we went  out and bought  a VCR.
  I have the tape in it's original box on my desk next to me and  there is a quote on the front of the Box,by  Al  Goldstein. He  writes "" A brilliant porn film. The
incessant sex is a  pleasure to behold  and  great fun to witness. No other film is going  to equal this one.""  I couldn't  agree more. Under the  direction of  Henry
Paris, Constance Money and  Jamie Gillis positively shine. This video  is an oxymoron. It  is true  porn  all the way,but with a real plot and a  plausible story line.
that doesn't insult your intelligence. This is a passionate  movie for  a thinking sexual person or even better a couple. This is not like any other XXX flick  I have
ever seen. It doesn't  degrade sex,it celebrates it. I plan to watch it  again tonight If I  just had my old lover back,tonight life would be would be sublime.",1326153600,5,1515,4.232142857142857
