8064974,2,B0009PW3TW,"Disappointing Soviet-era cinematic muck-raking of glitzy Las Vegas, USA-lifestyle masquerading as SF suspense.  The title is the best thing about this film...by far.",1490140800,,165,6.173913043478261
8064975,2,B0009PW3TW,"A hokey implausible design space ship picks up a distress signal from an unvisited planet TEM4. Naturally they rush to the rescue to find ambivalent papules. ""No we did not send a distress call; we were just playing around with the radio.""

While the crew is out hobnobbing with the friendly natives, the security officer back at the ship makes a subterranean discovery.

Id the spaceship Cyrno and its crew going to be good buddies with the BOS or are they doomed due to lack of flood insurance?

Maybe the pre-sci-fi or 50's feel is due to the film being produced at DEFA studios (East Germany) in the 70's.

The version I watched was German with English sub-tittles. Very liberal sub-tittles that can be annoying if you know any German at all (or English for that matter). In an attempt to paraphrase, they do not quite match the speech or intent.",1485043200,,850,4.6092715231788075
8064976,3,B0009PW3TW,"Weird mid-70's East German-made, English sub-titled sci-fi flick.  A spaceship and its crew land on a planet in response to a distress signal sent years before.  What they find is an aloof Utopian society from another planet that has enslaved the local people so they can steal a vital mineral.  That's as much as I could understand.  The scenery is barren, fitting for an alien planet.  The sets and costumes have a Euro post-Barbarella look.  I like the English title, gives it a lonely space feel.  The DVD is super-excellent quality.  The color is rich and the picture is clear and sharp.  I didn't care much for the film but I can recommended it for Euro sci-fi fans.",1467590400,,672,4.627118644067797
8064977,1,B0009PW3TW,"While pretending to be sci-fi, this is apparently what 70's East German soft core porn looks like. This may be the worst film I have ever seen.

And fyi, the title was meant with humor, I like Ed Wood in the ""so bad it's good category"". This actually makes Mr Wood look like a genius by comparison; it's just BAD.",1314057600,3,809,7.09
