6639347,5,B00NC9TTKI,"Fine half hours of television produced by Dick Powell's 4 Star Films. Season 3 includes the pilot episodes of Johnny Ringo (CBS 1959-60) and The Westerner (NBC 1960). The former co-starred Mark Goddard and the gorgeous Karen Sharpe, and the later starred Brian Keith and was created by Sam Peckinpah. I'd buy this season of Zane Grey Theater just to get those series' pilots, as they aren't available in their rerun packages, but fortunately the other 27 shows are superb.",1410220800,20,472,4.9125
