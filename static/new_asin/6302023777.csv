419997,4,6302023777,"This Panavision and color adaptation of Tennessee Williams' most poetic play is a showcase for both his words and Geraldine Page's Oscar-nominated performance.  Spirituality vs. carnality is the theme of a spinster  romantically attracted to her childhood neighbor, a wild libertine.  Elmer  Bernstein's score is magnificant - one of his finest and one of the finest  in film history. Listen during Alma's soul-searing final monologue using  images of ice and fire and listen to Bernstein's use of harp glissandos  that reflect the words.  This is Page's finest screen performance and along  with the score and the writing are the main reasons for viewing.  The  prologue and main title are letterboxed - showing the fine use of wide  screen.  Nominations were also received for Una Merkel's supporting  performance as the dotty mother, Bernstein's score and the period Art  Direction.  Well worth a visit.",914371200,54,906,5.274647887323944

Laurence Harvey and Geraldine Page give such memorable and moving performances. The juxtaposition of the characters' unbridled passions and maturity revealing the true nature of who they are is a mesmerizing journey and yet so heartbreaking in some ways at the journey's end. Elmer Bernstein's score captures these emotions so brilliantly. He is worldly or so it seems. Her heart is so virgin and pure, yet so curious to the lure of his worldliness. The little snippets she is allowed to see of his world shock her, yet enlighten a nurture deep within her. He is on a path of debauchery and one day he sees what his what one side of his unbridled nature has wrought. I love this film, but it is so devastating to watch.",1421193600,9,849,4.629139072847682
420142,4,6302023777,"Nearly all the films made from Tennessee Williams' plays reveal their stage origins, but none more so than ""Summer and Smoke"". I must admit that its theatricality put me off at first, but there are many things about the film I do like.

I was interested in seeing the film after I read reviews of ""Splendor in the Grass"", which claimed that the basic idea for that movie was borrowed by William Inge from Tennessee Williams' ""Summer and Smoke"". I love ""Splendor,"" and wanted to see if the 'Bard of the Midwest' could possibly have copied from Tennessee's homework.

""Summer and Smoke"" is set in an early 1900's small town in Mississippi. A young woman, Alma Winemiller (Geraldine Page), the daughter of a minister, is in love with the boy next door, John Buchanan (Laurence Harvey), the son of the local doctor. However, she is repressed emotionally, believing that personal dignity is paramount, while he is adventurous and wild. She stays at home nursing her mentally ill mother while he goes out into the world living life to the full.

John returns and has affairs with other women, which hurt Alma deeply. Although each comes around to the other's way of thinking, by the end they are just as apart as in the beginning.

Yes, Inge probably saw ""Summer and Smoke"" when it opened on Broadway in the late 40's, and there may have been an influence, but I think most people would probably need it pointed out. As far as the two movies are concerned, ""Splendor"" is the more accessible work while ""Smoke"" does struggle to overcome its stage roots.

But with that said, ""Summer and Smoke"" picks up the pace along the way, and the two leads are good together. Geraldine Page, an unusual beauty, repeats her role from the stage. She has some tough speeches to deliver, but the vulnerability of her character gains sympathy before the end.

Then there is Laurence Harvey. I've always found him a striking screen presence, and was therefore surprised to find websites where his peers from British cinema and theatre have been quoted as saying he was a bad actor. They seemed to get his roles on-screen mixed up with his life off-screen - a colourful one to be sure. However, there could also have been sour grapes involved; he was such a good-looking dude with a great voice to match, and the camera loved him. In fact, he gives the most natural performance in the film.

Many years before I saw ""Summer and Smoke"", I knew Elmer Bernstein's score. It is a beautiful and nostalgic work with a heart-wrenching main theme. The music gives a haunting sense of loss to the film, offsetting the staginess of backlot sets and overlit photography. It shows the power of music to enhance a film.

I am glad I saw the film now. It moves at its own pace, and presents some challenging ideas. Maybe it's not the best translation of Tennessee Williams to the screen, but it has its moments nonetheless.",1417392000,5,2883,4.661417322834645
420143,5,6302023777,Added to our classic movie collection. Good story line.,1417392000,,55,5.222222222222222
420144,5,6302023777,"I have been reading a good deal of Tennessee Williams recently, including ""Summer and Smoke"" and ""Eccentricities of a Nightingale"", his later rewrite of the play.  The reading led me to want to see a dramatization. I had never seen the film before. Plays are meant to be seen as well as read.

I was moved greatly by this 1961 film adaptation directed by Peter Glenville.  The film stars Geraldine Page who received the best actress award from the National Board of Review and from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for her portrayal of Alma Winemiller.  Page also starred as Alma when ""Summer and Smoke"" was revised off-Broadway in 1952.  Her performance rescued the play from its  initial chilly 1948 reception on Broadway. Page also starred in several other theater and film productions of Williams' plays.

""Summer and Smoke"" is set in a small Mississippi town in the years just before the United States entered WW I. It tells of the failed romantic relationship between a spinsterish, sexually repressed minister's daughter, Alma, and a young physician, John Buchanan, performed by Lawrence Harvey, who appears on the verge of throwing his life away to sexual dissipation.  Alma has been in love with John since childhood. In the drama, the characters gradually reverse their roles. Alma at first rejects John's physical advances because she finds they lack soul or true emotional feeling. Late in the play, after a pivotal scene in which John and Alma disagree about the significance of a chart of human anatomy, Alma seeks to initiate a physical relationship with John. By that time, John has already committed himself, and he sees Alma only in spiritual terms.

""Summer and Smoke"" is sometimes seen as a ""metaphysical"" play which explores abstractions such as the dualistic conflict between body and soul.  Watching this film shows that Williams fleshed-out his theme with human character. Page gives a fully realized performance of the repressed, plain Alma and makes her change of direction in the play convincing. Harvey plays the rakish young doctor effectively and conveys the increasing but belated depth of his character.  Una Merkel, who played Alma's emotionally disturbed mother also turns in an excellent performance in a challenging role. The film captures the ambience of a small Southern town early in the 20th Century, with its outward conventionality and with the vice not far below the surface.  Elmer Bernstein's music helps bring out the complex emotions and sadness of the story.

The film makes small changes to the play but is faithful to it in character and theme. have loved this play for a long time and enjoyed rereading it after several years.  I found it rewarding to see this film version of ""Summer and Smoke"" at last.

Alma Winemiller and John Buchannan are polar opposites. She is awkward, shy and timid; he is bold, forward and impetuous. She is a saint, he is a rake.

Alma spends most of the day taking on responsibilities her mother would have assumed but can't because due to her senility--going to middle aged women's social gatherings, housekeeping and preparing her father's sermons--and therefore has little spare time while other girls her age are going to boarding schools, balls and parties for young people with suitors left and right. Deep down she longs to experience the sweet, innocent delights of youth before she becomes an old maid but knows she can't because of her circumstances and therefore tries to accept them the best she can. She loves her mother and tries to put up with her kooky annoying antics and repress feelings of resentment towards her for going mad. In one brilliant scene, her mother teases her for looking out the window at John right in front of a guest. Alma loses her cool saying it is all her fault that she has been forced to `grow up too soon.' But then she quickly checks herself and apologizes saying she knows she shouldn't think that. She has to remember her mother can't help being touched in the head. She can't be reasoned with and Alma needs to just give up, accept her eccentricities and love her unconditionally.

John has big responsibilities too but unlike Alma, he makes PLENTY OF TIME (or rather TOO MUCH TIME) for recreation and the wrong kinds--loose women, drinking, gambling and fist fighting. He disrespects his father's wishes--not to bring his debauchery into their house and just go out to these places if he wants--by admitting the Spanish floozy Rosa (Rita Moreno) and her friends from the ghettos into the house for a party while his father is away on business.

The noise they create is so loud, Alma and her parents can't get to sleep so she calls John's father to tell him what is going on in
his absence and ask him to put a stop to it.

John's father beats Rosa's father with a cane in an effort to expel him from the house. In turn, Rosa's father shoots him. John blames Alma saying it was HER fault he died because she HAD to make that call but eventually he faces up to the fact that he is his own worst enemy, because after all he was the one who invited the low company to the house. Therefore he aspires to clean up his act and become a regular, solid citizen like Alma.

At the end Alma declares she has always loved him from childhood but knows it is better they remain friends apart since their relationship was more like a brother and sister. So instead of staying home and eating herself away with guilt and torment over her lost love like Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, she decides to enjoy life while she has it.

Geraldine Page and Lawrence Harvey have such great chemistry together and their romance has a rare depth and spark. And even though he is struggling with a physical attraction at times (like when he makes the moves on her in the gazebo) I always got the impression that his love for her stemmed more from her character than her face because of how they both teach other different lessons:

1. John to Alma: Letting go of her shy, awkward, timid nature.
2. Alma to John: Being a man of character and integrity.

Like many great films and books, Summer and Smoke is one of those stories that are so multi layered that there are many ways to interpret what is going on within the framework of the narrative.

For instance, is Alma really as innocent and saintly as she appears or does she have tricks up her sleeve? Does she really call John's father to stop the orgy because the Mexicans are disturbing the peace or is it because she feels insulted that John should prefer a `fallen woman' to her--a preacher's daughter--someone he has known since childhood? Or maybe for both reasons? When she defends her faith in the Christianity vs. Hedonism Anatomy Chart Debate scene is it simply because she wants the temporary thrill of winning an argument or does she sincerely want to win him over to Christ? At the end, is she saying farewell to the angel and turning to the life of a loose woman because it was her father's religion--not her's--she was just going through the motions--and now she is finally flaring up in her true colors a la Sister Ruth in Black Narcissus? Or does she still believe in God and has respect for basic Christian ethics--she just wants to be taken out for a date and make a new friend with the travelling salesman because she has learned there is nothing wrong with being courted every once in a while and romantic love has its proper place in the world as well as spiritual love? Alas, it is for the viewer to decide.

Page has so many great scenes like when she finally `lets it all out' at the end to John and the interactions with her mother and she uses her unique, fluttery, wispy voice and soft expressive, sea blue eyes to great effect.

Harvey glides subtly and smoothly from sinner to saint as is excellently foreshadowed in these scenes:
1. When he leaves his drunken guests and goes upstairs to `take a breather.'
2. When Rosa (the Spanish girl) says she wants to marry him simply to rise above her meager roots. He realizes she doesn't love him--she is merely a social climber and he needs to detach himself from her.

Charles Lang's cinematography is some of the best ever put to film. The soft pastel colors--those drop dead gorgeous shots with the trick or treaters at the angel fountain, the gazebo and the neighborhood. The interior designs of the houses are magnificent.
Elmer Bernstein's score is rich, lush, dramatic and filled with layers of details and dimensions.

But Geraldine Page is brilliant as the seriously repressed Alma, and Laurence Harvey with his slightly oily sexual charisma, is an unexpected casting choice, which really works. Only Rita Moreno's character seems seriously underwritten. So underwritten, that the character could easily have been eliminated completely without any great loss. Pamela Tiffin is surprisingly effective too, in what is easily the best performance she ever gave. But this is Miss Page's film, and she is so good it's wonderful to watch her. It's great we can see this film again after so long, but the transfer is only adequate. If you love Mr William's work you have to have it. But it is not a masterpiece. Now if someone of the caliber of Elia Kazan had been involved, to address the weaknesses of the screenplay, and the intrusive music score, it might well have been one.",1393545600,4,1010,4.877906976744186

Alma not only cares for her mentally ill mother, performs the duties at her father's church that would normally fall to her mother. She is patient, she is long-suffering. But in using the term ""long-suffering"" there is no sense of the martyr until a moment when her mother (played by Una Merkel) is incredibly cruel to her daughter, and in exasperation, Page says, ""I lay down my life like a rug for you to walk on....but you never say thank you."" Alma has had a crush on the boy next door since she was a child.(Laurence Harvey) He returns home from college where he has been studying medicine, following in the footsteps of his father. But, he is not really interested in anything other than gambling, carousing and drinking. A fine supporting cast, Pamela Tiffin, Rita Moreno, bring the story to it's climax.

In fact, this time around Alma's change was unrealistic and seemed somewhat forced.

The supporting cast was perfect: Rita Moreno, Thomas Gomez, Una Merkel and an imposing John McIntyre. The music by Elmer Bernstein charted the emotional course of the film and the prodution design was incredibly atmospheric. The screenplay which opened up Tennessee Williams' most stodgy play holds up as a superior work of art. Wrapped in Peter Glenville's loving direction, this is film that all film buffs must on and cherish.",1288483200,6,808,4.897810218978102

""Eccentricities of a Nightingale"" can be found in the Broadway Theatre Archive series by Kultur. ""Summer and Smoke"" has not been released on DVD (to date).",1265328000,,315,5.196078431372549
420290,5,6302023777,"Summer and Smoke has Geraldine Page as a woman in love with a young man next door. She lives in a parsonage with her dictatorial, repressed father, and a mentally ill mother. The film unflods and we see the tragedy approaching, and Ms Page becoming more and more aware of it, culminating in her final scene.

The lyricism of her acting, her gestures, her inner pleading, and her silences are wrenching and strangely evocative of how things are for many people..no hope left, but the edge that rejection and despair give to us in odd ways, making it possible to go on, in an aloien world, dersiring death as the next step that must be taken.

See this film with her, and witness greatness of the highest order. The rest of cast is excellent, especially Una Merkel as her mother, and Laurence Harvey as the man Ms Page loves.

The score by Elmer Bernstein is so beautiful,very plaintive, and elegiac at last, as the final notes of the harp underpin the conclusion of the film.

Peter Glenville directed this and he is to be complimented for it. The James Poe script, along with Meade Roberts, is far more faithful than Richard Brooks' Cat On A Hot Tin Roof or Sweet Bird of Youth, the latter , however, has Ms Page, so do not miss it.

I wish it were on DVD or even on TCM, but, at least there is the laser version in widescreen and the VHS version, but it needs to be seen in Panavision.

Buy this gem, and revel in the art of Geraldine Page, the glory of cinema.",1187308800,11,1462,4.356617647058823

She has fallen in love with the boy next door, John Buchanan [Laurence Harvey]. When John returns after being away she tries to win his love, but he falls in love with the town vamp [Rita Moreno]. Alma tries to be everything that John wants and in the end they both get swallowed up in each others desires. Geraldine Page was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars for her performance and should have won. If for nothing else one should see this film to see a real actress at work.

420295,5,6302023777,"There are a lot of things you can say about this film, but foremost must be the performance of Geraldine Page, perhaps the finest female performance ever captured on film. Her use of her hands, a glance...every nuance imaginable has not been matched (a close second: Giulietta Massina). Alma is a lot more complicated than most realize, a repressed rage, hopeless love, culminating in a dependance on drugs (not brought out so much in the film); ""those little white tablets...ever so merciful..."" After an Oscar nomination in 1953 for ""Hondo"", Page was subjected to ugliness by the McCarthy nonsense, and ""S&S"" was only her second film. English director Peter Glenville, famous for attention to detail (""Becket""), worked with fellow Brit, Laurence Harvey (a southerner by association since he played Travis in ""The Alamo""), and it was actually a fine group of talent. Tennessee Williams always thought this was his best play; he re-wrote it as ""Eccenticities of a Nightingale"", but the new idea, though admired, never survived. It made more reference to Alma's addiction, and also referred to all 4 women as caged birds, escaping in different directions. I applaud anyone who takes the time to soak in all the nuance that Williams has to offer, the mood and delivery of Glenville, and the unflinching perfection of Page's performance. Taking this all at once is quite overwhelming. AFTERTHOUGHT: I failed to mention the power of Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent music. Along with his score to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", these films were both transcended to a place complete understanding. Oops, I meant composer Elmer Bernstein; one of his best scores. HALLELUJAH! The DVD is very fine, a great 2.35 widescreen, and terrific sound quality. Page's last 20 minutes will blow anyone away. Alas, no DVD extras.

Funny that, but it also left a mark upon within me, and even in the 30th viewing of this film, I love it as much as I did 10 years ago when I was 24.

420297,5,6302023777,"Tennessee Williams is once again settling his accounts with parents and the South. One daughter is encaged by her preaching father into absolutele spinstery. One son escapes the cage of duty and dedication his father tries to impose onto him. Another daughter manages to escape the cage her mother opens up one day in a well-advised moment of inspiration. And a final daughter is nothing but the tool of her father's ambition to conquer the rich world even if it takes a gunshot to do so. The first daughter is also haunted by her mother's getting crazy at seeing the locked cage in which her husband has locked her daughter up. And this is supposed to represent that noble and genteel South that is so lovable and yet so cruel. But Tennessee Williams goes a little farther in this film by showing how people can change, but they change in exactly opposite directions. They cannot meet at first because the young man is not a gentleman and the young woman is a lady. But they can't meet later on because the young man has discovered his soul and asks the young woman to remain a lady, whereas she has finally understood that the soul is not all that counts and she would like the young man not to be the gentleman he has become and still to be the animal he used to. No way out, except an elopement. The younger generation always finds their ways out of all those cages even if at times it is hard, painful and even fatal or lethal. This delicate mental and corporal torture is the trademark of this Tennessee Williams that reaches universality, if not eternity. And the South becomes a showcase of mankind and is redeemed in such a process. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",972345600,13,1694,4.53921568627451
420298,5,6302023777,"Tennessee Williams did another great job with ""Summer and Smoke"" and the memorable phrases that he came up with will stick with you forever.  Just listen for Miss Alma (Geraldine Page) when she says ""I could  spread out my life like a rug for you to step on, and you'd still step on  it, and never say thank you, Alma.""
If you delight in great dialogue  and superb acting, this is a movie you just HAVE to get!
Geraldine Page  makes you rewind that VCR SO MANY TIMES that it is just the limit!  I am a  huge fan of hers and this was a new movie to me.  I couldn't believe it at  all - hers was a talent that will never be matched again.
See this movie  and you won't be disappointed - it will be one of those shows that you  watch over and over again to catch all the nuances that you couldn't catch  in prior viewings.  LOVED IT AND YOU WILL TOO!",966384000,24,847,4.0
420299,5,6302023777,"Living in Vicksburg for 17 years gives me a special pleasure to appreciate this film. Tom Williams who grew up at parsonage in Columbus at his uncle lived also shortly in Vicksburg and captivated well stuffines, pride and  naive arrogance in human relations which surprisingly survive till this  day. It is very difficult to transfer a stage piece into movie, it loses  either the interactive message or remains too stagey, or even becomes a  totally new story. It actually did well in this rendering, because  spectator should realize it was written for a theater, like Rainmaker of  Eugene O'Neill's, made into movie.
