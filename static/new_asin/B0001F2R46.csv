8011581,3,B0001F2R46,As long as you have no desire to learn any tap technique at all this dvd is fine.  It's very aerobic and the gal who leads it is very encouraging though a bit manic. I like that the back up dancers cover the entire range of skill level so I never felt like a failure and kept at it for a while.,1138838400,14,294,3.7419354838709675
