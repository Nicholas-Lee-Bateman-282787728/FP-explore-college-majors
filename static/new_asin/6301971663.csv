It was filmed in the early 1970's, and so it has that early 70's atmosphere.  The plot might sound silly to some people.  But, at least it's original.  I won't describe the movie to you.

392918,4,6301971663,"For a brief period of time in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was the go-to guy for a certain type of moderately budgeted big-studio action movie that proved very popular at the box office. The highlight of his career as a lead actor was the controversial Death Wish, but, immediately before that, he appeared in Mr. Majestyk, an all-but-forgotten film that, for my money, is considerably more entertaining than Death Wish or almost any of Bronsons other starring vehicles.

Bronson stars in Mr. Majestyk as the title character, a Colorado melon farmer whose attempt to hire a crew to pick his crop is threatened when he is arrested on trumped up charges. One of his fellow inmates on the same bus to the county jail is Frank Renda (Al Lettieri), a notorious mob hitman. On the way to the jail, Rendas associates attack the bus, but, in the confusion, Majestyk is able to drive off with Renda, whom he takes prisoner. Renda eventually gets away but hes furious with Majestyk, who wouldnt accept his bribe. Renda vows revenge, starting off by sabotaging Majestyks melon crop and terrorizing his hired hands. Needless to say, trying to get tough with Charles Bronson proves to be a big mistake.

Mr. Majestyk is set in the modern day, but it plays very much like an old fashioned Western, and thats not surprising. The screenplay was written by Elmore Leonard, who got started as a Western writer before realizing that writing mysteries paid better. The script for Mr. Majestyk (which Leonard later turned into a novel) was actually the turning point in his writing career. While the dialogue in this movie isn't quite at the level of some of Leonards later works, he still provides Charles Bronson with some effective one-liners, such as a line delivered to one goon, You make sounds like you're a mean little ass-kicker... only I ain't convinced.

Of course, audiences didn't come to see Mr. Majestyk for the dialogue, and the movie delivers a good bit of well-staged action. The film has three major set pieces: the attempt to hijack the bus that results in a big shootout, a later car chase, and the final showdown. Director Richard Fleischer had a lengthy action film career, including Soylent Green and The Vikings, so he stages solid, albeit not spectacular action sequences.

Mr. Majestyk represents probably a perfect role for Charles Bronsons low key, self-deprecating style. The producers originally had Clint Eastwood in mind, but he would have been too dour for the role. Bronson is easy going, likable, and deceptively straightforward (theres a great scene in which he sweet talks a convenience store clerk into loaning him money to make a phone call), a stark contrast to the increasingly angry Renda. Al Lettieri had a tragically short career specializing in mobster roles, and he makes a perfect foil for Bronson here.

Mr. Majestyk has no illusions about being a big movie, and, in fact, its melon crop storyline is probably unique among action films. But, despite a couple of slow spots and implausible plot developments, its fun escapist entertainment headlined by a perfectly cast Charles Bronson and featuring a much better than average script, direction, and supporting cast. This movie may not be an A-lister, but its certainly a majestic B-movie.",1496102400,,3264,4.938069216757741

394007,3,6301971663,"BOTTOM LINE: While not as entertaining as DEATH HUNT or THE MECHANIC nor as intriguing as BREAKHART PASS, (and certainly not in the same arena as his popular DEATH WISH movies), MR. MAJESTYK is nonetheless a good little action film from craggy macho man Charles Bronson. Fans should be happy to add this low key title to their Badass Bronson collection. 3 STARS

THE STORY (contains minor spoilers): Retired Army Ranger training officer, Vietnam vet, former POW and ex-con Vincent Majestyk has relocated to the rural Colorado town of Edna, where he purchases & manages a 160-acre watermelon farm. He becomes entangled in a local whites vs Hispanic migrants labor dispute and when the confrontation turns violent Majestyk ends up arrested. Due to his former criminal record the police turn a deaf ear when he tries to explain what happened. Also at the jail is vicious mafia hitman Frank Renda. He, Majestyk and other prisoners are scheduled to be transferred to a proper holding facility but en route some underworld associates attempt to spring Renda. The resourceful Majestyk escapes the chaos and takes Renda to a remote location. There, he hopes to negotiate with police to have his own assault charges dropped in exchange for the assassin, but when Renda escapes before a deal can be made Majestyk is left without a bargaining chip. Now, the police want him imprisoned for aiding & abetting (in addition to his original crimes) ...and the ruthless, psychotic assassin wants him dead!

THOUGHTS: Interesting vehicle for legendary big screen tough guy Bronson. Here he's basically an average Joe, (albeit with a varied and colorful past), who only seeks peace and anonymity. He doesn't want any trouble but he also doesn't take any crap. The story is a fairly straightforward one that doesn't tax believability too much, except perhaps for the wild chase sequence near the film's end. Interesting use of rugged rural Colorado locations adds plenty of earthy character to the look & feel of the film. Action sequences are well done and have a visceral energy to them. Veteran director Richard Fleischer steers the proceedings with a tried, steady hand. Tight script by genre genius Elmore Leonard is solid, with no waste. The only really hard thing to accept in this movie is the idea of action hero Charles Bronson as a country-fied watermelon farmer. LOL. Otherwise, this is an unremarkable but soundly entertaining action crime film.

THE BLU-RAY: Kino Lorber gives us a decent but not perfect hi-def release. The picture is pretty good for the most part, but many low light and night scenes have a disappointing amount of grainy video noise to them. Colors are strong with little bleeding or oversaturation. Focus is fairly sharp, with only a few soft shots. Soundmix is strong & level. No extras except for the theatrical trailer.",1450569600,2,2837,4.993657505285412

394086,5,6301971663,"Bronson is great as the troubled loner-hero who rejoins society by first protecting the oppressed and then himself from evil.  He seems to deliver a very few of his early lines in the police station as inarticulately as Rambo, which is not quite right for the movie in light of the other quips he delivers, but he delivers the rest of lines in great fashion.  There's also a slight inconsistency in his character--one moment in a monument of silence and the next he is delivering quips.  That's in the book and script, not in Bronson.  Finally,  he looks about twenty years too old for the part--but he can't help that either.
  There are some problems with the movie if you are seeking a serious film with artistic pretensions.
  1.  First, this film is adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel.  Leonard is a great author because of style and dialogue and less so because of complex character development and plot.  In other words, his characters sometimes seem more like stereotypes than archetypes.  He also recycles characters and scenes--not exactly, but those familiar his Westerns will be strongly reminded of other books.
  2.  Second, the film adaptation changes the ending in the book slightly for some reason.  My guess is that the writers and film producers thought the book ending was too familiar or maybe  less believable than the one the movie--but the book and the movie are really not about novelty or strict believability.  They are about retelling the troubled loner redemption story.
  3.  Third, production values are low.  It doesn't look very real.  Much of the music is cheesy.
  So what.  If you like Bronson, then this is a great movie--not as great as Hombre perhaps, but five stars for Bronson and Leonard fans.",1444003200,,1737,4.819727891156463

Directed by Richard Fleisher.
Widescreen on Side A of disc. Standard full-screen on Side B.

Vince Majestyk (Charles Bronson), a farm owner, and Larry Mendoza (Alejandro Rey) are hiring Mexican immigrants for the day to harvest melons. Majestyk uses the men's bathroom at a gas station and pays the attendant (Vern Porter) three dollars to clean the bugs off the window of his melon yellow truck.
  Later, Nancy Chavez (Linda Cristal) rides in with her work friends. The gas station attendant lies to her that the bathrooms do not work. Majestyk sticks up for her, but the attendant doesn't want a mess and believes they would steal the toilet paper.  Majestyk gets tough with the attendant and wins. He offers Nancy and her friends the chance to work on his farm.  When they arrive at Majestyk's land, Bobby Kopas (Paul Koslo) is there to cause some trouble. Majestyk's day only gets worse from there.

Also in the cast: Al Lettieri, Frank Maxwell, James Reynolds, Larry Cortinas,  Taylor Lacher, Jordan Rhodes, Bert Santos, Lee Purcell.

Charles Bronson was the age of 51 during filming.

You might recognize James Reynolds whom played the black prisoner. Currently he has the role of ""Abe Carver"" on the NBC serial, Days of Our Lives, since 1981.

Al Lettieri passed away the next year, October 18, 1975, from a heart attack at the age of 47.

  Good film that held my interest and the acting is what you expect from a movie in the 1970's. Released the same year as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B001IDSZ1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>&nbsp;(1974).

If he hadn't died away just a year after this movie came out, Lettieri would have continued to be a menacing movie bad guy. I bet a biography about him would be interesting considering that he was acquainted with real-life gangsters and you have to wonder if he knew any of their secrets. And he ended up becoming an actor in movies opposite John Wayne in McQ, Steve McQueen in The Getaway, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in The Godfather, Michael Caine in Pulp, and Peter Sellers in The Bobo.",1397260800,,646,4.483050847457627

Al Lettieri is over the top as hit man and principal antagonist Frank Renda.  Lee Purcell and Taylor Lacher as Wiley and Lundy round out Renda's core team, with Paul Koslo providing comic relief as the inept wanna-be tough guy.  Frank Maxwell, the character actor most likely to play a cop, plays the detective lieutenant who can't seem to pin a murder case on Renda, but locks up Majestyk for thumping a guy in self-defense.

Despite finding success in Europe, Charles Bronson still hadn't made it really big in the US in 1974, so Mr. Majestyk was marketed less on his name than on the promise of Richard Fleischer's film being another Billy Jack or Walking Tall, but the film was part of a one-two whammy with Death Wish, released only a week later, that finally propelled him to superstar status Stateside. Bronson may have managed to antagonise his director and crew so much that, according to Fleischer, they would barely talk to him after the first day's shooting but it's the perfect star vehicle for him as the kind of guy who keeps himself to himself until he's pushed too far. Elmore Leonard's script casts him as a melon farmer who manages to get on the wrong side of both Paul Koslo's small-time local hood who tries to cut in on his business and Al Lettieri's hitman with a seriously bad temper, with the police all too happy to use him as live bait and regarding the possibility of him getting killed as a bit of a bonus. All Bronson wants to do is get in his melon crop before his farm goes under, but with Lettieri and co. scaring off or crippling his workers and shooting up his crop it's only a matter of time before a melon farmer's gotta do what a melon farmer's gotta do...

Leonard cut his teeth on westerns, and this is very much a well-crafted modern western crossover to his now more recognised thriller work, but it knows its audience and their expectations perfectly and delivers the kind of decent-guy-fighting-back-after-being-pushed-too-far action movies that moviegoers in the 70s just lapped up, and it holds up remarkably well today. Fleischer had already delivered one minor classic thriller down on the farm with 1955's Violent Saturday and here his more than capable direction displays the kind of invisible professionalism that raises the film above its B-movie potential without drawing too much attention to itself while still making the most of the big setpieces like the botched attempt to rescue Lettieri in transit that drives much of the plot and the celebrated machine-gunning of the hero's melon crop sequence that sets the stage for the real violence to come. Bronson's on good form, with Lettieri a particularly threatening bull in a china shop and Paul Koslo giving good weasel as the lowlife with ideas above his abilities who sets the ball rolling. All in all perfectly satisfying Saturday night action fare.

MGM/UA's 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen DVD is for the most part a decent transfer, though it has trouble with a few of the darker shots. While the US NTSC release has the original trailer, the PAL version released in most of the rest of the world is extras free.",1366588800,3,2827,4.76530612244898

395034,4,6301971663,"How can anyone make a list of man movies and not bring up the films of Charles Bronson? Granted he's already been in the cast of three of the movies I've chosen to write about already (THE DIRTY DOZEN, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and THE GREAT ESCAPE), but those movies included him more as a member of the cast and not as the star. As Bronson's career grew he went from playing the mute lab assistant in THE HOUSE OF WAX to the main character in a number of action films in the seventies including today's gem MR. MAJESTYK.

Bronson stars as Vince Majestyk, a watermelon grower who wants nothing more than to get his crop in. As the film starts he shows his caring side by taking the side of migrant workers who just want to use a gas station's rest room. Hiring them to work along side his already picked crew, he returns to the farm to find a hustler named Bobby Kopas (Paul Koslo) trying to force him into using the crew Kopas wants to supply. A physical altercation that results in Kopas losing his gun and having the stock used to change his mind results in a warrant issued for Majestyk's arrest.

Placed in a jail Majestyk runs afoul of mob hit man Frank Renda (Al Lettieri). As far as Majestyk is concerned he's just another guy in jail. Renda strikes fear in the hearts of the rest of the convicts but not Vince. The prisoners are loaded for transfer to another location but their bus is attacked by a group trying to free Renda. In the aftermath of the attack a number of officers are left dead or dying and Vince has taken Renda and the bus for a drive to his summer cabin. He makes a deal for Renda's release just to get his crop in, but Renda's crew show to rescue him.

The die is cast. Renda won't listen to reason, wanting nothing more than to exact his revenge on Majestyk. The police won't interfere, hoping that Majestyk can be used as live bait to catch Renda in the act. Not willing to bide his time, Renda eventually attacks Majestyk, first shooting up his barn filled with watermelons and then breaking the legs of Larry (Alejandro Rey) his foreman. Now its time for Majestyk to get some revenge of his own.

Written by action author Elmore Leonard, MR. MAJESTYK is a fantastic action/revenge film that moves at a fast pace and doesn't waste a moment of screen time. Each second seen on the screen is planting the seeds for the final showdown and doing it with perfection. And the two leads are amazing to watch. Lettieri was always cast as a mobster and killer and seemed to excel at those roles.

Bronson was the epitome of the tough guy you just knew you shouldn't mess with but who stood up for those less fortunate. He made a living playing roles like this, becoming a icon of the seventies. He didn't possess the looks of the typical leading man having a rough exterior, but there was something about him that made you wish you had him in your corner. He had more movies that fit the ""man movie"" category and you'll see me write about them in the future. In looking back Bronson was one of the main stars to represent the kind of actor found in those films. He took no guff, he kicked butt and he stood for something bigger than himself. And in MR. MAJESTYK Bronson gives a good example of the kind of star he was just before he became a bigger international sensation.",1306540800,2,3293,4.365415986949429

Mobster Frank Renda(Al Lettieri) does everything he can think of to get Vince because Vince refuses to 'let' the local mob boss (Bobby Kopas played by the jerk you love to hate Paul Koslo) hire and place workers in Majestyk's fields.  Majestyk returns from town where he hired a crew to pick melons, to find the local mobster there with workers already in the field picking.  This of course makes for an interesting setup because one, Majestyk has hired a crew, and two, he doesn't want to 'pay' the mobsters at all.  He just wants to get his melons in in time to ship.  Several fun events follow from machine gun and shotgun shooting of melons sitting in the shed ready to be loaded to take to market to various run ins and chase scenes.  Majestyk is a tough but 'good/caring' man.  Nancy Chavez(Linda Cristal) is ultimately Majestyk's love interest, but the 'relationship' is really only a few brief asides and not really a big piece of the plot.  Mr. Majestyk, Breakout, and Bordeline are the only movies Bronson did that really dealt with Mexico/Chicano characters.
Mr. Majestyk is another of several Bronson movies that are fun to watch again and again as simple entertaiment. (The Mechanic, Chato's Land, Dirty Dozen, Breakout, Breakheart Pass and White Buffalo).  Bronson reached pinnacle of acclaim with the Death Wish series.  Some of the Death Wish movies are quite good, but like Rocky and Rambo, the plot/story lines became redundant after too many 'sequels'.

is that it is a stripped down, no frills, thrill ride. Mr. Majestyk is a farmer who needs to get his crop in or he loses his place. It's that simple; at least, the bad guys think so. But when they, rather casually, interfere with Majestyk past all of his endurance, he confers a world of hurt upon them in imaginative, and unexpected, ways.

There's plenty of explosions and mayhem; but there's also trickery and slyness. That's why it has such a special place in this action-lover's heart.",1278374400,,724,5.5636363636363635

A tough and somewhat cynical man, he was a soldier, did time in prison, and went through a rough divorce.  He and his immigrant workers are hassled by a small time crook.  A scuffle with the crook lands him in jail where he encounters a hit man for the mafia (Frank Renda - played perfectly by a chubby Al Lettieri - `The Turk' Sollozo from The Godfather).  Renda and Majestyk don't seem to hit it off, and the rest of the film's action centers around Renda and his gang of thugs efforts to kill Majestyk.  In typical Bronson fashion, Majestyk tries to just live his life in peace, but when Renda won't let him, Bronson is going to show him who is boss.  This is standard Bronson fare:  innocent man wronged kicks some serious butt.  The great melon slaughter is probably the most famous scene of this movie (a big pile of watermelons gets shot up by Lettieri's thugs with submachineguns - worth the price of admission on its own!).

395137,4,6301971663,"Not as well known as some of his other movies, Mr. Majestyk is a way above-average Charles Bronson movie from 1974 with a script from well-known and respected author Elmore Leonard.  Vince Majestyk is a melon farmer who wants nothing more than to get his watermelon harvest in, but trouble arises in the form of local troublemaker Bobby Kopas. Thanks to some trumped up assault charges, Vince is brought to jail where he meets infamous mafia hitman Frank Renda.  When Renda's escape attempt goes awry, it's Vince who ends up on Renda's bad side, setting off a vendetta that won't stop until one of them is dead.  Pretty straightforward action drama here with most of the action, including a good car chase and shootout, saved till the end.  It's exciting throughout as the tension builds to the inevitable showdown you know is coming.  Nothing groundbreaking here, just a solid, entertaining action movie that'll keep you interested from start to finish.

  At the top of his game, Charles Bronson is Vince Majestyk, a Vietnam vet now working his 160-acre spread and trying to get his melon crop in.  Always a good tough guy, Bronson is very good here, handling the action and dark comedy equally well.  His opposite is played by classic 70s tough guy Al Lettieri (did he ever play a likable character?) as Frank Renda, the hitman obsessed with exacting some revenge on Majestyk.  Bronson and Lettieri are excellent adversaries, leading up to the exciting final chase/shootout.  Linda Cristal is very good as Nancy Chavez, a migrant worker working for Vince who ends up being more than just a worker.  Lee Purcell plays Renda's girlfriend, Wiley, while Paul Koslo and Taylor Lacher are Renda's henchmen, Kopas and Lundy.

  The MGM DVD is a solid effort with both widescreen and standard presentations of the movie available, the widescreen looking pretty good and cleaned up.

I found it a little hard to believe that mob hitman Lettieri would be so determined to avenge himself against Bronson rather than flee to safety when he had the chance, but otherwise this is a pretty good '70s action pic, one that gives the usually stoic star more dialogue than usual. He even gets a rare chance to display a sense of humor in several scenes. It's also nice to see the beautiful Linda Cristal, best known for TV's ""The High Chaparral,"" as Bronson's love interest.

395205,3,6301971663,"Like Clint Eastwood, Bronson never had real success until he went to Europe in 1968... Then he hit, and hit big... In one year he becomes a star, and an action-violence king...

Bronson has a strong Slavic face, invisible slit eyes, a gently menacing smile-something like Jack Palance, but more humane...

Social themes are not the usual stuff of Bronson films, but in 'Mr. Majestyk,' he looks tough, yet manages to convey a sympathetic streak in the character he portrays...

He stars as a cool fighting loner who finds his efforts far to be carried out, and solves his problems with muscle and firearms - this time a formidable shotgun..

Vince Majestyk, a Colorado melon grower who haven't clipped his melons yet, gets trouble from a local racist labor racketeer Paul Koslo (Bobby Kopas) who attempts to force him to do business with him, using his crew rather than the hand-picked Chicano migrants he employed...

Majestyk straight advise to the unscrupulous punk is clear: Not to interfere... In this moment, Richard Fleisher's film looks as an action picture about labor and race troubles.... But the script twists it on throwing our genuine working man in prison on false charges...

Accidentally in the same jail is gangster Frank Renda (Al Lettieri).

When Renda's mafia associates stage a breakout for their boss, Majestyk seizes Frank and frustrates their carefully-schemed plan... He then offers to exchange the mafia thug for his own freedom... However, his own plan is ruined when Frank escapes from him, promising bloody revenge...

Al Lettieri, the ruthless hoodlum, is probably best known as Solozzo in ""The Godfather,"" and as a loan shark in 'Rocky.'

Dragging along with Bronson, while he battles the mafia and cops, is Linda Cristal (Nancy Chavez), the beautiful Labor Organizer who provides all the necessary help to our hero... Nancy is quite clear with her Latin accent: 'If you want to go to bed with me, why don't you say so?'

If you like to watch the machine-gun slaughter of hundreds of defenseless watermelons, this is the movie to watch...",1168214400,4,2069,4.971014492753623

This movie and the Getaway with Steve McQueen were must see Movies in the 70's.  You can add Dirty Harry and Magnum Force too.

Bronson is so cool.  He could make you freeze just by looking at you. He wastes some dudes with a shotgun that was way cool in the 70's and still good now. Violence back then was better, more dramatic, more shocking, more cool than the current overkill fake stuff that they make now. It was more real back then.",1108598400,5,570,4.053571428571429

I think this is how a movie draws attention. too people who are familure with the surounding area's such as a movie being shot in los angeles,california those people who have been there or live there would notice certain things about the area and therefore that would draw them to the movie but also the movie would need to have a plot to it whether it would be a drama or action or comedy.a must see movie and also a collectors Item(my opinion of course).",1078876800,6,983,4.559322033898305

His job is not made any easier when he runs afoul of a local punk (Paul Koslo) and a mafia hit man (Al Lettieri).  Given the subject matter, this is obviously not a film that takes itself too seriously.  It's a fast-paced flick with a screenplay by novelist Elmore Leonard and some very effective action scenes.  A good example of the ""man alone"" low-budget action flicks that were made in the 70s.",1060300800,12,518,4.421052631578948
395210,5,6301971663,"I want to give this movie 20 stars but i can't. Charles Bronson plays one of his best roles here. Just an ordinary farmer who wants to get his melons in.

Bronson keeps it nice and simple from Start till Mid-Way in the movie and only really breaks free at the end,when he has not 1 but 2 guys who are after him
hit man Renda (Al Lettieri)who he meets up in jail thanks to Bobby Kopas.

Al Lettri plays a perfect part in this movie as a mafia boss. I don't want to spoil the movie but this is just right down the best 70's movie made Way to go Bronson. The dvd has a great picture and sound quality for a 70's movie.

All Bronson wants to do is get his melons in, but every one and every thing seems to be trying to stop him.  His biggest obstacle being a mafia hitman who wants Bronson dead, dead, DEAD!  Bronson doesn't so much as frown when his workers are kicked off his land, and his buddy's legs are broken, but watch his pained expression and clenched fist when he sees his melons shot to ribbons!  Then all hell breaks loose!  This is one of Bronson's best quality films.  His perfromance is actually perfect for the character he plays.

7818514,4,6301971663,"A good Charles Bronson vehicle but not as good as I remembered it.  This viewing, I noticed little errors in continuity, logic and in the action scenes which I didn't notice in my youth.  The dramatic chase scenes with the mobsters chasing Majestyk's truck are a case in point.  Majestyk, riding in the bed without hand holds, would have been thrown from the truck.  In the armed confrontation with Renda, Majestyk passes up opportunities to kill Renda and end things.  I suppose the director was going for suspense rather than accuracy. Overall, still a good movie.  However, if you are addicted to modern thrill a minute action movies, you may find the buildup to the final confrontation a little slow.  The strong point of the movie is very similar to that in Valdez is Coming.  Both feature an arrogant villian who badly underestimates the opposition.  Surely this farmer, Majestyk, poses little threat to a big-time mob hit man.

I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1523059200,,1006,4.796511627906977

He's also had supporting roles in some worthy westerns and war pictures. The three aforementioned pictures (plus Mr. Majestyk) all feature Bronson as the lead and, in each one of them, he delivers. All of these films were made in the 1970's meaning realistic stunts and effects - refreshing aspects when compared to today's films. I'm old enough to remember that The Ford Motor Company used clips from this film promoting the toughness of the Ford F150 Pick Up (TV spots). Apparently a stock pick up was used in the film and it well withstood all of the pounding it took - well, watch for yourself.
