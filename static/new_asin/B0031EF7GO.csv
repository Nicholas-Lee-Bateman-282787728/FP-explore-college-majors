8386931,5,B0031EF7GO,"Very well presented throughout. I particularly like the emphasis on common sense tips and safety. Too many woodworking videos demonstrate terrible safety practices and then make some vague claim about guards being removed for clarity. (One especially terrible ""educational"" video you can find on youtube shows the presenter using his pinky as a heel when cutting a long rabbet using a router table, and then using his fingers to bring a spinning router cutter to a stop.)

It is a basic straightforward project that is demonstrated, but it's a useful one with a variety of techniques and tools. Watching someone else run through the whole thing is a great confidence builder. It's easy to understand which tools you should use where but it's great to see someone else actually doing it and their approach. I'm sure I avoided having to learn a few ideas from making mistakes!

Obviously if you don't have all the tools used in the video available you cane easily work out what you need to do to compromise; at least seeing the ideal way to do something highlights whats important. For example falling back on sanding to remove blade marks if you don't have a jointer. In several cases fallback alternatives are presented in the video itself.",1503532800,,1240,4.872037914691943
8386932,5,B0031EF7GO,"Sat through the whole thing in one sitting. He's a great teacher. I'm a beginner and nothing was above my head, and any confusion I had was easily fixed by backing up the dvd and listening again.
I am looking forward to getting into the shop and starting applying the lessons.
I am using a shop at a community college so we have all the tools.
A beginner would probably not have all the tools in his home shop.",1455408000,,410,4.2025316455696204

8386935,5,B0031EF7GO,Great for beginning cabinetry work! Demonstrates fundamental techniques for case work. I use it with my Carpentry classes to lay a foundation for beginners.,1359417600,2,156,5.541666666666667
8386936,4,B0031EF7GO,"I'd rate this as suited somewhere between a beginner and an experienced woodworker.  There are too many power tools for a beginner to have on hand, and the skills are probably too basic for a master woodworker.  In this DVD, George Vondriska uses carcase techniques for step-by-step building a small wall cabinet, about the size of a medicine cabinet, from start to finish.  This video is very light on hand tools, so don't expect hand planing tips.  Despite the reliance on a plethora of power tools, he does make a few concessions for those who don't own a fully stocked shop.  Although I can't justify buying all the gadgets he uses, at least it isn't as ridiculously outfitted as Norm Abram's shop. It seems that good woodworking is a combination of skills and shortcuts, so I was impressed with some of his tips that would help turn a frustrating project into an enjoyable one.  I came across this DVD after building a custom computer desk from scratch (my own plans)--no dovetails, but plenty of other joinery.  Despite the skills I acquired doing that, I still found this useful.

A big plus for me is that George's screen presence is far better than most; no distracting idiosyncrasies, good pace, etc.  Anyone who has had to suffer thru a Popular Woodworking video knows there are plenty of skilled craftsmen who lack any ability to teach in front of a camera.",1321056000,7,1369,4.718487394957983
