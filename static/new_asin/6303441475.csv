I was THRILLED to find this copy online!!",1391212800,3,129,4.2
682496,3,6303441475,This is a cute little book for toddlers.  I don't know that I would buy it again for someone but it was okay and my grandson thought it was okay.  He didn't ask to read it again like he does so many of the other books.,1390694400,,218,3.717391304347826
682497,5,6303441475,"I purchased this on DVD because my teenagers wanted to watch it with their baby cousins and we only had in on VHS.  It's one of their favorite Christmas movies and at the price, Christmas just got better!",1390348800,2,204,4.368421052631579
682498,5,6303441475,My kids have loved this little movie since they were toddlers and even though they are now teens still watch it every Christmas.,1387238400,,128,4.608695652173913

682500,5,6303441475,A cute storyline with beautiful animation. My three year old grandsons requested it several times over the holiday season. Would highly recommend.,1358121600,,146,5.681818181818182
682501,5,6303441475,I originally owned a VHS copy of this video for my youngest son now age 20. My  youngest grandson loved it. We literally wore it out and I was so happy to find it at Amazon in a DVD format.  My grandson continues to love this story about a little dog named Spot and his magical Christmas.  We enjoy watching it whenever he comes to grandma's for a visit.,1357084800,3,354,4.101449275362318
682502,5,6303441475,"This has been the best seasonal DVD for my 22 month grandson.  With it, he has learned new words - sled, sleigh, reindeer, tree, etc., and within the context that can help him understand and enjoy upcoming Christmas.  He asks to watch it everyday and each time has made observations and learned new words. There's a catchy (tango?) tune that he loves as well. Perhaps most importantly the content is simple and appropriate.  Spot is a kind talking dog and friend, and is respectful to mom and dad.",1355875200,3,497,4.625
682503,5,6303441475,"Even though this is a very old children's dvd that came out ages ago, the dvd received was brand new!  Thanx to this new video, I will again be able to provide fun viewing of this beloved dvd for the grandchildren.",1345075200,,214,4.219512195121951

7850345,2,6303441475,"Unremarkable

I will stick with programming more on caliber with Raffi, Baby Boost, Older Winnie the Pooh, and 50 year old Bambi certain other Disney's.

I think Richard Scary has a few that are decent for toddlers.. preschoolers

Our little guy has LOVED the above mentioned and they've been incredibly stimulating .. .vs. these Spot movies",1425859200,,341,5.053571428571429
7850346,2,6303441475,"Not very exciting. My toddler was not interested, but he loved the books",1422316800,,72,4.615384615384615

7850348,5,6303441475,"Anyone with young children should have this in their Christmas library!  I owned it on VHS years ago for my daughters, and recently upgraded to the DVD for my first grade class.  They loved it!  Nice story, colorful graphics and cute music!  Highly recommend.",1419724800,,259,4.818181818181818
7850349,3,6303441475,"I purchased this in 2013 for my 2yr old. It was a Christmas gift that I thought would go over well since my daughter enjoys the books. However, she has watched it twice since Christmas of 2013 and it is now Christmas of 2014 that I complete this review. It doesn't hold her attention. The sound quality is very poor. The visual quality is grainy and I find it to be slow-paced and boring myself. BBC produced this, if I remember correctly and so it may just be an old ""made for tv"" kinda deal that didn't transfer well to DVD. Just a thought. I am usually happy with BBC productions. Just not this one. Maybe other DVDs featuring Spot are O.K.
I would not buy it again.",1416441600,,669,4.234375
7850350,5,6303441475,"We received this item earlier than estimated date. It plays good too! Our children liked this movie, that's cute for kids. Thank you & have a good day!",1399852800,,151,4.428571428571429
7850351,4,6303441475,"The 'Spot' books are always fun. The book is
hard bound, stands up under lots of rough treatment
and being 'baby-tasted' as well.  The colors are
bright. Drawings are simple.",1396915200,,174,4.8
