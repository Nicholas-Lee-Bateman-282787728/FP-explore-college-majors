4462799,4,B004SI5VSQ,"The bank is crawling with low-paid employees willing to use opportunity for personal gain. Corruption inside and outside this financial building forms the plot that becomes multi-faceted before the bad guy is caught. But wait--WHO IS BAD, who is GOOD? Little Erica is good. Beyond that? Disaster in banking, financially struggling common folk, greedy CEOs, lawless money merchants, and questionable cops all make this a very believable situation in today's world, and more so since the 2008 filming.

Hats off to ""HOT"" Jodi Whitaker (`Venus' `Good' `Roar' `St. Trinian's') as Louise, single mother, who is drawn into crime by a co-worker's involvement as well as being blackmailed. She's good at acting, but the character has some evil flaws. She'll ""do anything to protect her daughter.""  As does a fraud squad cop, DCI Crawford Hill (Toby Stephens-`Jane Eyre' `The Wild West') who beds beautiful Lou while they both are involved in this case. BAD! Compromises seem to be the order of the day for this cast, even among the bad boy partners Manesh (Riz Ahmed-`Centurion' `Four Lions') and Phillip (Laurence Fox-`Becoming Jane' `Elizabeth Golden Age'). There's no clear cut definition for friend or partner in this thriller. Relationships change faster than bank funds transferring between accounts. This high-tech driven financial world makes frequent use of low-tech knives, so viewer beware of the ""strong language and violence"" warning on the box. Not for kids.
SUBTITLES, YES, a good thing. Bonus, none. 134 min feature in 3 parts. Filmed in Liverpool, London, & Manchester.

This film provides a look at London underworld, flashy yuppie contemporary life, sexy stars, and a thriller 3-episode mystery with ever changing good guy/bad guy confusion. What's not to like? If you like thriller, you'll like ""WIRED"". Not a Mary Poppins or fantasy trip to Oz, for sure.",1304121600,23,1867,5.237458193979933

8439748,4,B004SI5VSQ,"There is nothing worse than watching a crime drama or any drama, and knowing or at least guessing how it will turn out in the end.  This three-part made for British television show has some unexpected twists that are refreshing and keep your interest.  It's ahrd to tell who is good and who is bad, and if the hero is helping or using his connection.  Toby Stephens is the reason I bought this DVD, and he does not disappoint.  He is a fine actor and not well known in the U.S.  Maybe when Black Sails comes out in January he will become a household name.",1378857600,,555,4.247619047619048

8439750,5,B004SI5VSQ,"""Wired"" is a superbly intense and wonderfully directed British movie in three episodes with each episode running about an hour.  The story is mainly set in a very ""high teck"" bank in modern London. A single mom that is financially strapped, Louise Evans (fabulously acted by Jodie Whittaker) is promoted; however there are ""strings"" attached to the promotion coming from some very unsavory criminal types that want her to get them access to a very big account in order that these criminals can divert some of the money from that account into their own accounts.  In doing so she will, of course, be paid a huge amount of money.  At first Louise refuses but finally relents because she is in desperate need of money for her and her daughter that she adores.  As a result she becomes entangled with a group of very nasty thugs that want her to do even more for them in order for them to ""run"" more scams.

What I really liked about this film is that it is very difficult to totally trust any of the characters.  All seem to have the potential of being a criminal including the cop that rescues Louise and wants her to work ""undercover"" for the police force in order that the thugs that have recruited her can be caught,  I was at all times questioning the true motives of this cop.

Not only is ""Wired"" wonderfully directed with outstanding scripts, it is greatly acted by all.  I really thought Toby Stephens (of ""Cambridge Spies"") was marvelous as the rescuing undercover cop and Laurence Fox (of ""Inspector Lewis"") was fabulous as a very nasty thug.  In fact,  all of the acting in ""Wired"" is fantastic.  I was greatly entertained by this movie.",1309651200,18,1646,4.5993150684931505
