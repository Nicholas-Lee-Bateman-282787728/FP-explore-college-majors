Independent film director Shine Louise Houston three-time winner of the Feminist Porn Awards, came out with a film that possibly not even some of her followers could stomach.
I'm not a lesbian, nor a porn fan, and bought the DVD out of a hint that this lady (no pun intended) had done something different, and I was right. She combines a sad lesbian love story (as a romantic love story, it had to be sad) with another love forbidden to women, mixed martial arts. The MMA lobby and the porn industry may have combined to put this out of the market, and really you must dig hard to find it.
I'm posting this because of my total dis-accord with an earlier review. The editing of this film looks atrocious? But so does it in a trillion films out there, and yet people may find reasons to like it. In this case, I like the daring of the director, the reality-TV quality of the cinematography, the courage of the performers to reveal themselves and their intimate moments... There is enough of a storyline to keep you on edge, and enough character definition for you to feel sad about the end.
Hardcore was never so tender, so crude, but also so real, and pure.
Take it from a man who saw enough porn to be sure that he did not like it, and has seen about two thousand feature films to distinguish a gem from the crap. Crap this made-to-video is not. May this CHAMPION survive it's reviewers.",1340236800,,1432,4.407547169811321
8337419,1,B001R5QV8W,"The product summary was/is misleading.
The movie itself was of good watching quality, no skips or scratches.
DVD was brand new, as promised.

Video itself contained poor acting, no transition in the attempted story line, and over all was no good.
Had the producer not tried to make it a movie and just created it as a few separate scenes, it would have been given a five.

I would not recommend this item, but I would recommend most others from the producer of the movie.",1310083200,,471,4.529411764705882
