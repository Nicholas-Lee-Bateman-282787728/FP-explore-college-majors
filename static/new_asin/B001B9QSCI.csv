8282451,2,B001B9QSCI,"I've had this video on my shelf for a few years now and figured that a review was in order.  First of all, credit to Sammy Franco and his workout partner Tim who definitely look good in this video.  They certainly practice what they preach.  However, I feel that War Machine II kind of misses the boat when it comes to conditioning for fighting.

Essentially, what is offered here is a high volume (up to 60 set per workout) bodybuilding-style split routine with a few accessory exercises thrown into the mix.  Lots of reps and lots of sets with an emphasis on isolation exercises.  Although Franco does include some of the ""big and basic movements"" such as squats, military pressing and bench pressing (but strangely, no deadlifts), he does these movements on the smith machine so, as he asserts, ""I don't really have to focus on the stabilizer muscles.""  What the combat applications of not working the stabilizers are I can scarcely imagine, as I would suggest they are key to moving around a heavy uncooperative ""weight"" with two arms and two legs.

Aside from bodybuilding, War Machine II offers a few accessory exercises and concludes with recommendations on cardio training.  Franco is evidently an advocate of prolonged cardio sessions (his War Machine book, not reviewed here, suggests 60 minute sessions done several times a week).  There are far more efficient ways to accomplish the same goals of cardiovascular conditioning, especially for fighting, than the multiple long slow distance sessions that Franco recommends!

As another reviewer mentioned, following this routine would take a very big chunk out of your day, which would be very prohibitive for someone who still wants to do their martial arts training and take time for their family.  Fine, I suppose, if you don't have many obligations outside of the gym, but is this really the best way for a fighter to train regardless of time constraints?  It appears, based upon what is seen in this video, that Franco has simply not kept up with sport science and has evidently confined his study primarily to Weider magazines under the premise that, since bodybuilders look great, they must be able to perform great, too.  Unfortunately, the physical demands imposed on a fighter are not the same as those imposed on bodybuilders.  This video does nothing to address the extreme energy demands potentially imposed by combat, which can stress your anaerobic systems to the max.  Further, there is nothing here about developing, among other things, coordinated explosiveness (or even brute power for that matter), and balance.

Bottom line, fighters, be they professional combat athletes or those explicitly focused on self defense, simply do not train the way shown in this video.  At least not anymore, if they ever did.  Bodybuilders, those who do not subscribe to HIT anyhow, train this way.  A far better option would be to develop a program (ideally with some periodization) that incorporates heavy weights, odd objects, High Intensity Interval Training, plyometrics, and various other training protocols.

As an alternative to War Machine II, this reviewer suggests that those interested in fitness for fighting investigate the products produced by such authorities as Ross Enamait (first and foremost), Kelly McCann (Crucible Combative Conditioning videos), Zach Evan-Esch, Steve Maxwell, and Mark Hatmaker.  To repeat myself as a point of emphasis, start with Ross Enamait whose work is backed by solid research and will give you a conceptual understanding of the physical requirements for combat as opposed to merely ""a routine."" That is what Franco gives here.

This video now goes back on my shelf, likely never to be watched again.

Good luck!",1351468800,,3720,5.100660066006601
8282452,3,B001B9QSCI,"I got this product under the assumption it built upon the information in the War Machine book. I watched it a few times and didn't find much difference in information between the book and DVD. This DVD would be great if you didn't understand a technique or were confused by the book's recommended exercises, but other than that, spend your money on something else of Sammy's. The techniques and strategies were nothing cutting edge, but the exercises that were covered will make you strong. I can't recommend the War Craft and War Machine books highly enough. Those are both fantastic books, but this DVD falls a bit short in new information. The DVD falls into the category of ""wat was the point?"". If you are going to do Mr. Franco's programs, I would recommend you just get the Army of One package to start with. It will give you pretty much all of the information contained in the War Machine DVD and then some.",1285545600,,915,4.585365853658536

There's simply nothing more effective than this workout. Keep in mind, this is the companion to the War Machine book or audiobook. Condition yourself into a living weapon today and snag a copy.",1241481600,,402,5.106060606060606
8282454,5,B001B9QSCI,"The War Machine II program is the most complete combat conditioning that I have ever seen. This program is 100% geared towards making you strong and conditioning every muscle of your body, so that you will be prepared for the brutal reality of fighting for your life. In this DVD, Mr. Franco and Tim will take through their entire program and thoroughly explain each exercise in the routine. This DVD is an absolute gem for anyone who is serious about being strong and conditioned for street combat.",1213747200,,499,4.747126436781609
