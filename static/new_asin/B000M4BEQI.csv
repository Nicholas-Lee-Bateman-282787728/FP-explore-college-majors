8166173,4,B000M4BEQI,"This is a low budget, but not low quality, comedy about a semi-senile old lady who lives with one of her sons and his wife.  She is seen as a burden and the son's wife is at her wit's end and wants desperately to palm the old lady off on some of her other sons (one of whom is a wealthy criminal with a trophy wife).  Of course the others are not thrilled by this demand and each argues over a Sunday dinner that the status quo is optimal.  No one wants the old lady.  Soon she disappears and the family mistakenly believes that she died and arrange for a funeral.  Now that she is apparently gone, the family members all act as though she was beloved.  There are yet more plot twists, but it would spoil it to reveal more.  Most of the dialog and the acting is way over the top, but is funny nonetheless.  China Zorrilla, the very talented and ageless Uruguayan actress, has a key role as the wife of one of the other sons. This is not her best film, certainly not in the class of Elsa and Fred, but she does well.  Those unfamiliar with Argentine Spanish will wind up reading the subtitles.",1279238400,,1092,4.186602870813397

A remarkable performance is made by actress China Zorrilla (Elsa and Fred).",1265500800,,300,5.270833333333333
8166175,5,B000M4BEQI,"I saw this movie when I lived in Argentina and I was around 10 years old. My family and me couldn't stop laughing from beginning to end. My sister and me used to crack up after repeating lines of the movie in any situation (""dos empanadas, que miseria, dos empanadas..."" haha).If you want to see a piece of argentinian culture, with humor, this movie is a must. Aside from the fact that all the actor and actresses in the movie are among the best from Argentina (Antonio Gasalla, Luis Brandoni, China Zorrilla, Enrique Pinti, Andrea Tenuta, Betiana Blum, Dario Grandinetti...etc etc)  I bought this movie like 4 years ago, dealing directly with someone from Argentina. I cannot belive that is finally in amazon!!! Just get it!!",1205625600,,727,4.76984126984127
8166176,5,B000M4BEQI,A classic movie at a fair price. The movie is multizone so it can be played in zone 4 and 1. The shipping was a little slow but it worth the wait.,1204416000,,146,3.59375
