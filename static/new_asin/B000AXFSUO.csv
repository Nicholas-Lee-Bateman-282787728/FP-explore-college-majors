8080033,5,B000AXFSUO,they do great videos. They are the king and queen of small sailboat worldwide cruising. Maybe 2 of the bravest people on earth. It is a lot harder to go around the world on a 24 or 29 foot boat than it is on a ship or even a 60 Volvo racing sailboat. These people are sailing hero's.,1442016000,,283,3.896551724137931
8080034,5,B000AXFSUO,Very good. All sailors choud read this one.,1411603200,,43,4.5
8080035,5,B000AXFSUO,"This book is analogous to a grandmother's household tips for new housewives (in a good way).  It assumes you know how to sail and want to know some tricks of the trade while messing about the boat. Great ideas on boat layout, products (without buying them) and even some technical equipment tips for getting the most out of your boat under sail and living aboard.  I watched it with a very experienced sailor and he learned a few things as well.  Good stuff from likable people.",1378598400,,478,4.534883720930233
8080036,3,B000AXFSUO,"I have read and viewed several of the Pardey books/videos. I very much like their style and substance. However, I am getting a little tired of seeing many of the ideas/thought resurfacing in book after book, and now in videos. While this DVD is a good watch on a winter evening when the boat is on the hard, I will not buy any more of their books/videos.",1356825600,2,354,4.298507462686567
8080037,5,B000AXFSUO,Any book Lin and Larry write will teach a LOT on the finer points of sailing.  My wife and I use their books as a refrence for our sailing in our 27 Orion. Double A+ book.,1351987200,,171,3.75
8080038,3,B000AXFSUO,"This movie tells how to get partially ready and for that it is useful.  Would have liked to see more sailing, of which I know they have done alot. It does what the title says.",1165363200,,175,4.0
8080039,4,B000AXFSUO,"Lin and Larry might not have made a big budget production, but they pass on a lot of info here. I bought this and Get rEady to cross oceans. Enjoyed the sailing scenes that illustrate the ideas. Wish I knew more about where some of the scenes came from. But that is not what the DVD is about - its about outfitting ideas and there are plenty here.  I particularly like the storage ideas.  Second DVD had more about actually being at sea - this one is sort of the starter, Cross Oceans carries on.

Loved the pics of their 110 year old race boat in New Zealand. These folks are trying to keep sailing even though they must be in their 60's.  A real inspiration.",1131926400,12,660,4.214285714285714
