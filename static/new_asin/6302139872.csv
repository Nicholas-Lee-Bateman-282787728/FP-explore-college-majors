7822442,5,6302139872,I've been to Ireland twice and Touring Ireland visits a lot of the places i've seen.  Loved re-visiting all my favorite places and recommend this to anyone interested in visiting Ireland.,1382745600,,187,5.032258064516129
7822443,2,6302139872,It would not play. The tape skipped so badly that we could not watch it. Was very disappointing. Not sure how to return it.,1362355200,,123,4.166666666666667
7822444,5,6302139872,"I ordered this tape for upcoming trip to Ireland. Though I found it was not the best for what to do and how to do it, it is a beautifully done overall view of Ireland. Yes, there is great video of rich Ireland to help you plan your trip, but it also includes an interestingly done history of the Irish people and their land. This will make the trip much more meaningful. I would recommend it if you are planning to explore in person, while riding your exercise bike or just to learn about Ireland.",998870400,,497,4.242105263157895
