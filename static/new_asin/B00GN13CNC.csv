6094114,5,B00GN13CNC,"As with all mickey DVDs, this one is excellent. It has the main featured story/episode and 3-4 others as well. My daughter has so many clubhouse DVDs in rotation I can't remember what the other episodes are, off the top of my head. How can you go wrong with mickey/Minnie anyway?",1393459200,,279,4.490196078431373
6094115,4,B00GN13CNC,"Well of course it had to happen eventually--Minnie Mouse doing the glass shoe thing. Actually, Minnie has played a princess before, like in the classic short ""Brave Little Tailor."" But this is the context of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, so Minnie and Mickey have to ask the viewer a lot of questions...then pause...the resume the story.

There's just no way this DVD can miss with kids who love princesses, especially fans of Sofia the First. It's a half-hour segment from Season Four, which is reportedly the last season of the series. Fortunately, it's uniformly well done, as is the rest of this high-quality preschool series.

Each of the episodes has something to do with fairy tales:
 Minnie-Rella (February 14, 2014, Season Four)
 Pluto's Tale (January 20, 2012, Season Three)
 Mickey and the Enchanted Egg (November 20, 2009, Season Two)
 Daisy's Pony Tale (April 15, 2013, Season Four)

In addition, there are ten short ""interstitial"" episodes from season 2 of ""Minnie's Bow-Toons."" Also, there is a nice little Castle play set to unfold and put together. They can't do that sort of thing enough.

I find ""Daisy's Pony Tale"" to be the most amusing thanks to the extra comedy provided by the dependable Professor Ludwig Von Drake, voiced by the extraordinary Corey Burton. The voice cast, by the way, is a Hollywood who's-who: Russi Taylor, April Winchell, Will Ryan, Bill Farmer and so many more.

As per the series' style, there is a lot of visual gimmickry through wacky contraptions, a fine balance of adventures so each character gets to shine, and of course all that interaction that kids do play along with (I've seen this happen at home and it's adorable).",1393459200,,1667,4.925
6094116,4,B00GN13CNC,"Ultra cute movie and has the great Minnie-rella story my daughter loved on Disney Junior!  I do however miss the fast play feature, I don't know if it was because it was the initial play on the Blu-Ray player or if it will happen every time but it seemed to want to ask a million questions before we could get to the menu screen.  But all in all I love this and my daughter loved getting it for her Valentine's Day gift.",1392768000,,420,4.109756097560975
6094117,5,B00GN13CNC,Both my daughter and I absolutely LOVE this movie! It is completely adorable! She will make me ballroom dance with her when her and Mickey are dancing (she just turned 2). I have actually been humming the song that they sing during the ball all day today! ;) She has been asking for Minnie everyday since she first saw it. If I put on a different clubhouse movie or episode she gets upset and asks for Minnie!,1392768000,,409,4.324675324675325
6094118,5,B00GN13CNC,"My daughter and I both love the movie Cinderella. It was one of the first Disney movies I remember. I loved her sparkly gown and all the magic. My daughter fell in love with the same movie and when she saw that another favorite character, Minnie Mouse, was in a new movie Minnie-Rella where she becomes Cinderella, she was thrilled to say the least!

Minnie Mouse falls asleep and she becomes Cinderella. All of our favorite Disney characters from Micky Mouse Clubhouse play a role as one of the characters from Cinderella and it parallels much of the original movie which Minnie and friends flare.

This particular movie came at a great time because my daughter has been having bad dreams and we talk a lot about good dreams. Showing her the magic of daydreams was a great tool for her to understand that everyone dreams and it doesn't have to be bad.

This DVD also features Minnie Bow Toons as a bonus which Paige has also always loved. Minnie-Rella is a hit in our house and even my five year old son likes to sit down and watch it. (shhhhh - don't tell him I told you!)",1392163200,9,1074,4.414141414141414
6094119,5,B00GN13CNC,"My daughter loves this DVD.  Not only does it feature her favorite character, Minnie, but she is her favorite thing, a princess!  At first I though this was an hour long movie featuring Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and friends, then I realized it is actually four episodes.  The first episode of course is Minnie-Rella and then there are three additional episodes.  There is even some Bow-Toons on the DVD from Season 2.  They are episodes that yes have been seen on television but it is nice to have them all on one DVD to watch anytime, anywhere.  The story is adorable, featuring Micky and the gang (like the evil step sisters) asking Minnie to do chore after chore to keep her busy while they get a surprise ready!  Minnie feels like Cinderella and falls asleep dreaming of the Cinderella story.  So cute and Disney-filled!

Includes:

Minnie-Rella
Pluto's Tale
Mickey and the Enchanted Egg
Daisy's Pony Tale",1392076800,25,906,4.787096774193548
6094120,5,B00GN13CNC,"A great new Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVD for the whole family. My kids, even though they are getting older cannot get enough of Mickey and Minnie and this DVD is chock full of both of them. What I love about this DVD and the series in general is the mix of music and messages of friendship and caring among others that as a parent I want my children to learn. Your kids will enjoy this retelling of the Cinderella tale and will also learn some important things about friendship, love and more. A great new DVD!

6094188,5,B00GN13CNC,"My daughter is 2.5 and going through a princess/Cinderella stage.  She is also a huge fan of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Minnie Mouse in particular.  When I saw this DVD I resisted buying it, knowing that at soon as I bought it I was going to have to watch it 8 times a day and I'd get tired of it.  I bought it anyway and I was right, this is an instant hit.  My daughter loves it.  In fact, we haven't even gotten to watch the other 3 episodes on the DVD yet, because she only wants to watch Minnie-rella episode.  From an adult perspective it is a pretty good epidsode.  The music is catchy and the animation seems more crisp and newer than some of the other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs.",1394928000,2,689,4.174242424242424
6094189,5,B00GN13CNC,My 18 month old has recently developed a small obsession with Minnie Mouse so I purchased this DVD after she saw a commercial for it (and cried for 2 minutes after it went off).  The main story (Minnie-rella) is super cute. Entertaining but the perfect length so that she doesn't lose interest.  Also has several other stories on them that I actually found myself watching.  I believe there are two hours worth of episodes on the DVD.  Great purchase.,1394496000,,451,4.670886075949367
