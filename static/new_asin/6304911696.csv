942595,5,6304911696,"I love this Godzilla movie, it rocks, it also is good because Ishro Honda directed it. Also the only place you should buy this movie is at Amazon.com because every where else you'll be riped off for huge  prices!",960768000,,212,4.435897435897436
942596,4,6304911696,"This is without words the best Godzilla film of the 1970's. The storyline, the special effects, and the monsters almost matches up to the quality of the better 60's films. It's the sequal to ""Godzilla vs.  Mechagodzilla"" and it is much better than the original film. Since  it's the last of the classic Godzilla series (that makes 15), the producers  tried to make it one of the best using Akira Ifikube's famous Godzilla  scores and trying to bring the best effects that Toho could provide to the  silver screen. The monsters include the of course Godzilla, who is unusally  meaner in this film than any other of the 70's epics (Toho was trying to  return Godzilla to his original state which was a mean, radioactive,  towering horror in which they don't do to the exstent of the original, but  he's meaner than he was in the earlier 70's films). Titanosaurus, which is  a new character and is alot diffrent than the monsters of the 70's, because  he is not a monster that is released by aliens and has fancy ray beams or  transforming powers, but a real dinosaur that depends on the real powers of  a dinosaur... claws, teeth, and tail (although, he does have a tail like a  fan which enables him to blow his opponent to the ground). Of course theres  the fantastic Mechagodzilla, who has tons of light rays and missles spewing  from his eyes, fingers, and stomach and he can fly! The quality of this  tape is fantastic compared to other Godzilla movies released by other video  companies. It's in the SP mode, great sound, and to top it off it's  digitally remastered from the original negitives of the film. This is a  great movie to watch on a Saturday night around 1:00 AM after  ""Saturday Night Live"" is over. So, get a big bowl of popcorn a  Pepsi and enjoy ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"".",959990400,2,1792,4.569182389937107
942597,3,6304911696,"After a long hiatus, Ishiro Honda and Akira Ifukube return to close the 1st G series.  Honda brings a welcome level of seriousness and gravity to the proceedings.  However, spfx director Nakano is no Eiji Tsubaraya.  The  result is a decent film that could have been much better.  Mechgodzilla, so  powerful in the previous film, is reduced to playing second banana to the  rather silly Titanosaurus.  The plot has some pretty deep holes, especially  when considering the loose continuity between this and the original MG.  Godzilla is still stuck in his ""hero"" mode but is not too  annoyingly cute this time.  Ifukube's music brings the film series full  circle and adds a considerable amount of emotional heft to the picture.  The final battle is pretty spectacular, though marred by a few sub-par  effects.  Though not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination,  Terror of MG is a good entry in the G saga.",959644800,,915,4.837662337662338
942598,3,6304911696,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla movies, and I would give the movie itself a 5 star rating. However, the TV broadcasts of 1979 (possibly 1980) was the last time an uncensored English copy of this movie was shown. All  of the videotape editions (as well as the broadcast on TNT or TBS - I  forget which station) are incomplete. The original English version had an  incorrect intro before the opening titles, but the movie itself was  complete except for a brief topless shot of Katsura undergoing surgery that  had been cut out - 4 seconds of footage.
The Simitar and Paramount Home  Video editions are of the censored version. (The original Paramount tape  was even missing the movie's title and listed an 89 minute running time  even though it was recorded on a T-80 tape in SP.) The original movie runs  82 minutes. The censored version is 79 minutes.
I have a tape of a 1979  broadcast of this movie which was edited for its time slot (10 minutes  missing), the Japanese LaserDisc, the Paramount tape, and this Simitar  tape.
Most of the censorship centers around the violence. Someone shoots  a gun, but you don't see the other person get hit. There was little or no  blood. They show the violence, but not the consequences on the act. During  the opening titles which use clips from Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, some  bloody shots of Godzilla are missing. The truly annoying part of the  censorship is the fact a MAJOR story element is missing. In this video  edition, Mechagodzilla appears to shut down for no reason. All references  to someone committing suicide were cut out.",952214400,7,1585,4.698181818181818
942599,4,6304911696,"After 1974's ""Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla"", some people may be disappointed about this final installment in the Showa Godzilla Series, but they probably should give the film a second look. It really somehow manages  to bring the Godzilla saga to a fitting (first) end, this also because the  dark tone of the story underlines the fact that Mr. Honda never would  direct another Godzilla film. This film had the lowest box office of all  Godzilla movies in Japan, so Th Executive Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka  decided to finish the series after the financial disaster. As with all the  Japanese monster movies, you have to see the full-uncut widescreen version  of it! I think the US version is still cut and missing most of the violent  scenes. The Japanese LD, of course, and even the German video release are  uncut. Not the best entry into the series, but not to be missed by any  serious sci-fi fan!",950572800,,897,4.766233766233766

942790,4,6304911696,"Just finished watching ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" released by Toho Studios.
You can always tell the evil spacemen from regular humans because the evil spacemen are always the ones wearing big sunglasses indoors!
""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" is the 15th and final entry in the original Godzilla series that was released back in 1975.  After a brief summary of previous movies in the series; the movie opens with a search by a manned submarine for any surviving pieces of the Mechagodzilla that Godzilla had previously destroyed.  Cut to a mysterious woman sitting on the rocks as the tide crashes against them, now cut to the submarine being destroyed by Titanosaurus - that is under the control of Dr. Mafune - a disgraced scientist who is working in cahoots with those sun-glass wearing space aliens from the third planet orbiting the black hole.  They want to level Tokyo and rebuild it as a haven for their race while subjugating the rest of humanity of course.  To achieve their evil ends, they have turned Dr. Mafune's beautiful daughter into a cyborg.
While not exactly a Godzilla masterpiece for director Ishiro Honda - it's not a bad Godzilla movie for him to have depart the series on.  A lot of Honda's notions on this movie were incorporated into later Godzilla movies.
Great Fun!

I'm reviewing the Classic Media DVD edition which contains both U.S. and uncut Japanese versions of the film. The Japanese version is quite different and contains many scenes not in the U.S. version one being the operating table scene with a graphic scene showing a woman's breast (fake of course). The film also starts out without the Godzilla montage like the U.S. version.

The Picture on the U.S. version starts out a little grainy, but this is only because of the stock footage used. Once the real film actually behind the picture is very clear. The film features Titanosaurus, Godzilla and of course Mechagodzilla and while it takes a little bit to get to the big battles it is a very good entry in the series.

The DVD has a short feature The Women of Godzilla which is around 11 minutes long and fairly interesting. If you're looking to add this film to your collection buy the Classic Media version while it is still available.",1401926400,5,1137,4.675

943246,4,6304911696,"The fifteenth and final entry in the original Toho Studios series is actually quite good despite its shortcomings.

One such shortcoming is its familiar plot line which is almost identical to the previous film ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"" (Released in the US as ""Godzilla vs. the Bionic Monster"".  Under threat of a lawsuit from Universal Studios the US release title was later changed to ""Godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster"".).  Once again an alien race from ""The Black Hole"" try to conquer earth and claim it as their own.  They have rebuilt Mechagodzilla and plan to try again.  However this time they have two Earth people on their side.  A borderline mad Japanese scientist angry at being shunned by the scientific community and his daughter.  Also, a new monster named Titanosaurus (Apparently discovered by the mad scientist.) will fight on the side of the invaders.

Godzilla fights these two opponents to protect his homeland.  This time around he does get a little help from the scientific community of Japan who have discovered Titanosaurus' weakness and exploit it.

The fight sequences are very good judging by past Godzilla films.  They are a little silly as they all are, but this particular movie's fight scenes were the least silly which helps add to the movie's entertainment value.  As with all the previous movies it is great to see this movie in its original form with the original dialogue track restored.  The picture quality is also excellent.

Even by today's digital and CGI standards the special effects hold up fairly well even today.  Yes, they are a little obvious and silly but I think they work very well.

The final scene of ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" is almost a fitting end considering this movie (mainly because of its disappointing box office returns) marked the end of the beginning for the iconic monster.  It's just a simple scene of Godzilla walking back into the ocean to begin his journey home and (as silly as this sounds) I thought it was the best scene in the entire movie.

In the end, I do not think you will be disappointed with ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"".  It still entertains for me even after repeated viewings and I think you will enjoy it too.",1381363200,2,2192,4.844086021505376

943250,5,6304911696,"The montage was pretty cool. It had Godzilla (original) in Ishiro Honda's form, Then it had Godzilla vs Monster Zero, and then when the REAL cool part of the montage starts, It had the best parts of Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla. The First monster (Titanosaurus) came on like the First 20 minutes. Then we saw mechagodzilla apper at the First quarter of the movie (I'm skipping through some) teaming up with Titanosaurus. The scene when Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla rampage through tokyo, When a cry of help by two boys for Godzilla (thats a change) Godzilla lets out a short roar and then he pops up and battles The other monsters. Then in another battle with Titanosaurus and mechagodzilla (a really grewsome part) when Godzilla pops off Mechagodzilla's head.

I liked this movie because it had awesome action. I'll give it 6 stars scince it was really nice movie. And I'm surprised that it wasn't phoney ever scince Godzilla's revenge. Well it was from the '70's not the '60's scince godzilla movies just get better and better. You'll definetlly would like to watch this if your a die-hard fan of Godzilla. The ending is pretty sad though, I'll give you a hint: Sombody Dies. (NOT GODZILLA). It's a Hour and 20- something minutes but it's worth the wait. And I'm just a 9 year-old child and I know you'll love it. (Next movie: Godzilla 1985)",1372464000,5,1342,4.759656652360515
943251,4,6304911696,"Picking up immediately where the previous film left off, TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA follows a mad scientist that has created a monster mind control device so that he may harness the giant beast Titanosaur in a plot for revenge. Dr. Mafune aligns himself with an evil alien race that has rebuilt the mechanical terror Mechagodzilla as well, and together, they set out to destroy all of mankind! TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA would be the last film in the original series, as well as the last Godzilla picture to be directed by the great Ishiro Honda. With aliens, androids, secret agents, and (of course) giant monsters, TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA assembles all of the most successful science fiction and fantasy elements together at last, while focusing on the same tragic and multi-layered characters that have defined Honda's career. On top of the excellent costuming and incredible miniature set design that are featured here, the greatest strength in this entry lies in the creative framing and expressive camera work that bring us right into each explosive action scene. Honda uses an array of low and wide angle shots as he pans around the entire set, giving the monster battles a larger look and feel than ever before. Godzilla is restored to an indestructible force of nature as he absolutely obliterates his opponents in a series of vicious attacks. Of the many epic moments contained within the film, Godzilla's first striking appearance against the black, lightening-strewn sky as he is announced by Akira Ifukube's triumphant score remains the most memorable. Unfortunately, poor box office returns would result in Godzilla's unofficial retirement for over a decade, but the unmitigated King of the Monsters would return to wreak havoc in GODZILLA 1985.

943375,1,6304911696,"I gave this DVD 1 star simply because there is no way to give this DVD no stars.

First, let's talk about the truth in advertising, or lack there of.  The back of the case says the extras include ""Interactive Trivia Game, Film Facts, Godzilla Trailer Collection, Godzilla Video Art Gallery, 4 Full Screen Motion Screen Savers, Printable Photo Gallery, Printable Art Gallery.""  The ONLY one of these things that is remotely true is you get 1 screen of basic film facts, and that's it!

Second, let's talk about the 5.1 Surround Sound audio track.  The DVD does offer 2 audio tracks, the 5.1 and a Dolby Digital one.  However, the 5.1 track audio is out of synch with the video!  Yes, it's an English dubbed Japanese movie, but, even at that, the track does not match; the sound effects are grossly behind the on screen video.  Also, Simitar took a page from Rhino's Transformers and G.I. Joe DVD's and added new sound effects into the mix that no one asked for!

Lastly, the choice of video print is the Bob Cohn Enterprises US theatrical cut.  That cut removed so much of the film that could be construed as too violent for kids in order to get a G rating that what happens on screen often times makes no sense!

If you want Terror Of Mechagodzilla, get the Toho Master Collection DVD from Classic Media instead.  You get the UPA TV cut, which is mostly completely Toho's official intended English cut, save for one scene of fake bare breasts that was naturally cut for American TV audiences.  You also get the Japanese cut of the movie, which is actually shorter than the UPA TV cut because UPA added a prologue to the print to explain what happened in previous Godzilla films, in particular Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla, aka Godzilla Vs. The Cosmic Monster, aka Godzilla Vs. The Bionic Monster.  There's a commentary track on the English cut, a 10 minute featurette on the many women who have appeared in Godzilla movies, a photo gallery, and the Japanese trailer.

EDIT: Just now discovered that the 2nd audio track, the Dolby Digital one, is incomplete!  There is absolutely no audio for the last 2 minutes of the movie when you select that track!  ABSOLUTELY do NOT buy this DVD!",1336348800,2,2182,4.61139896373057
943376,4,6304911696,"As a child, I must've made my mom rent Terror of Mechagodzilla about 100 times on either BETA or VHS, as it was always one of my favorite Godzilla films. However, as I got older, i wondered why certain scenes in the movie seemed to cut off at the oddest times. It wasn't until recently that I discovered that US film companies had cut out certain scenes in this movie in order to make it rated G. In addition, the traditional English dubbing of this film is not accurate, as the plot of the movie leaves countless questions.

But now, FINALLY, this movie has been released in the US in its full, un-cut greatness. After watching the original Japanese version with English Subtitles, I finally have answers to all of the questions that plagued me as an adolescent! The plot makes much more sense, and the movie is much edgier and exciting to watch.

The English version includes a 5- minute prelude which that contains poor audio and scenes cut from past Godzilla films. It loosely ties this film to the previous G Movies, but uses the aliens from Monster Zero instead of Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla...obviously done by Americans who didn't full research their product.",1328227200,,1167,4.68780487804878
943377,5,6304911696,"Confession time: I am a big Godzilla fan. There are few delights more... delightful to me than to see two (or more) Japanese men in rubber monster suits beating the absolute snot out of each other.  So it goes without saying that I had already seen ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" before this DVD came out.  Or had I?  As it turns out, the VHS copy I had been watching since I was a kid was heavily edited, cutting out whole portions of the film and eliminating important plot points.  And the worst part was, this was the only way to experience the film in the US until Classic Media released this on their line of remastered Godzilla DVDs (which have stopped by now, by the way - come on, Classic Media, when are we going to get ""Godzilla vs. Megalon?"")

The Story: after being defeated by Godzilla in the previous film (""Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla""), the evil alien cyborg Mechagodzilla has been lying broken and dormant on the ocean floor near Japan... or has he?  A Japanese submarine expedition is sent to find the remains of the metal monster, but finds that they have disappeared.  Even worse, they run into and are destroyed by another monster altogether: Titanosaurus, a dinosaur that has somehow survived in the modern world.  Interpol(!) is called in to investigate, along with marine biologist Akira Ichinose.  Ichinose finds that Titanosaurus had already been discovered 15 years previously, by outcast scientist Doctor Shinji Mafune.  Arriving at his house to investigate, he finds the doctor's lovely young daughter, Katsura who claims that her father is dead.  Well, as it turns out Dr. Mafune is alive - and that he is in cahoots with the evil Black Hole aliens from the last film who are rebuilding Mechagodzilla to (what else?) take over the world so that they can build their utopian city over the ruins of Tokyo (so all the evil aliens want to do is do some urban renewal and build cities?  Why can't they just buy up some land in California or something? I love 70s Godzilla movies!).  Also turns out that Katsura is a cyborg, brought back from the dead owing an accident some years ago (hey, I'm not spoiling anything - this was all revealed in the movie's trailer) and tasked with controlling Titanosaurus through her cybernetic link with the monster.  With the combined might of Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus, nothing can stand in the aliens' way... except, of course, the Big G himself.  Will Godzilla be able to take on these two foes and prevail? Will Interpol and Ichinose be able to stop the aliens and help Godzilla?  And what role will Katsura, the conflicted half woman/half machine play in all this?

I remember buying this disc how many years ago the day after it was released (on my birthday - thanks for the present, Classic Media!).  I took it home, put it in my PC's DVD drive and selected the Japanese version of the movie in the menu.  Then I watched the Toho logo come up on the screen and...

Wow.

Let me say that again.

WOW!

The titles burst onto the screen in Japanese in front of a fiery, exploding background, backed by Akira Ifukube's bombastic, ear pounding score.  Then Godzilla and Mechagodzilla appeared in a flashback from the previous movie and started slugging it out through the opening credits.  And I nearly wet myself.  This was so much better than the version I had seen before.  It was in Japanese.  It was widescreen.  And it was uncut.  And viewing the movie in its entirety with the bits that had been excised put back in changed my opinion of this movie from pretty good Godzilla movie to Great Godzilla Movie.  In fact, rate this one now as being behind only the original 1954 ""Gojira"" and ""Mothra vs Godzilla"".

What makes this film so great is that it works on more levels than just the monster fight scenes (although those are certainly important).  Unlike some other Godzilla movies, the human plot in ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" matters a great deal to the overall story.  The cyborg character of Katsura is easily the most complex, being torn between her humanity and her mechanical nature, which has been twisted into one of hate and revenge by both her father (who was forcefully rejected from the scientific community for his discovery of Titanosaurus) and the evil aliens.  She is a tool, but wants to be more than that; one of the main struggles in the film is her choice between her two conflicting natures.  This is not to say that ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" is some arthouse masterpiece of cinematic complexity - there are still silly costumes, silly acting, plot holes, monster fights and explosions galore, so don't worry.  It's just nice to see a little bit of complexity in a film that most will dismiss as kiddie fare.

And this has something to do with the director.  After a string of very silly (but very fun in an MST3K sort of way) and very low budget Godzilla movies Toho decided to bring back the original director of Godzilla, Ishiro Honda to do a sequel to the successful ""Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla"", which had been directed by Jun Fukuda.  Honda decided to do something a little more adult and made this film, which actually ended up being the worst attended film in Godzilla's original ""Showa"" period (1954-1975).  This also ended up being the last film in that series, and Honda's last film as a director.  He ended up helping his buddy Akira Kurosawa in the 1980s and 90s, acting as 2nd unit director on ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"".  He also directed some of the segments for ""Akira Kurosawa's Dreams"".  I wonder how many people realize this when they watch these... it's amusing to think that a major contributor to some of the greatest films of all time (directed by one of the greatest directors of all time) once made a living filming men in monster costumes ravaging models of Tokyo.

All is not perfect, though.  Akihiko Hirata goes over the top as Dr. Mafune, and leading man Katsuhiko Sasaki is adequate, but just as bland here as he was in ""Godzilla vs Megalon"".  In fact, it's almost as if he's playing the same character.  And I have to laugh at some of the insane logic of this - Dr. Mafune is shown to have been banished, nay, even savagely beaten by his fellow scientists for his theories on animal control and his discovery that a dinosaur was still alive after millions of years.  So... while a giant mutant radioactive-fire breathing dinosaur has been strolling around leveling cities and fighting other reawakened prehistoric beasts, giant insects and even alien monsters, these guys refuse to admit that an underwater dinosaur could survive to the present day.  I weep for Japan.

This Classic Media DVD presents ""Terror of Mechagodilla"" in its original Japanese form uncut (how I love saying that!) and in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The video on this disc is awesome, especially for a Japanese film from 1975 (keeping in mind that the Japanese have not always been as concerned with film preservation as the US).  Colors are good and not too washed out or too saturated.  There is little to no scratches, dirt, etc.  The sound is also good, being in Dolby Digital 2.0 for both the Japanese and English language versions. The English version is the UPA Television version (NOT the butchered edited version) which also available for the first time on DVD (but you can learn more from the audio commentary). It's weird in that it starts out with an introduction that isn't in the original film (that is presented at a different aspect ratio than the rest of the movie) with a narrator that won't shut the hell up even through the opening title and credits.  It thus ends up being longer than the original version.  And is it my imagination or is the guy who dubs Katsuhiko Sasaki the same guy who dubs him in ""Godzilla vs Megalon?""  How's that for some Zappa-esque conceptual continuity?

This disc has a few extras, the foremost of which is a commentary by SciFi Japan contributors Keith Aiken and Bob Johnson.  Neither are great orators and Johnson starts the commentary with what sounds like a cold, but they have a wealth of information on the movie and are interesting to listen to.  And I have to say that wow, these dudes really like Ultraman.  Throughout the film they will point out which actors appeared in which ""Ultraman"" series, or which monsters from ""Ultraman"" make a cameo and so on and so forth.  I don't think I ever needed to know so much about the relationship between Godzilla and Ultraman - thanks guys.  The only real complaint that I have about the commentary is a disturbing part where Bob Johnson ogles and growls at leading lady Tomoko Ai, appearing in a short skirt and pigtails - during a flashback sequence in which she is presumably very, very underage.  Thank you, Mr. Johnson for scarring me for life.  Don't do that ever again. Ever.  The next time you do, I'm alerting the authorities.  The other extras include a gallery of photos and movie posters (which is neat) and a short featurette on the ""Women of Godzilla"" by Godzilla expert Steve Ryfle.  The only oopsie  I found on this release is that while the DVD case says that it contains the ""Original Japanese Trailer,"" I was never able to find it on the actual disc.  I had to end up watching it on YouTube.  What the -?!  Oh well.  Even if you don't have the original trailer, ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" DVD, I still love you.

Pluses - Great story, good monster fight action, great music score.

Minuses - Some of the acting, some very minor plot holes.

Conclusion - This DVD is a must-have purchase for any Godzilla fan, or any fan of Japanese fantasy cinema in general.  In fact, this is just a good movie period. And now you actually get to see the whole thing!",1299110400,,9669,4.665682220909628

943380,3,6304911696,"After a string of juvenile, budget-strapped Godzilla movies in the early 1970s, the big G's 15th film was touted as a ""return to greatness,"" with veteran director Ishiro Honda at the helm and maestro Akira Ifukube providing the score. Without question, the film has more going for it than several of Godzilla's previous outings, but as for a ""return to greatness,"" well...it just kind of ain't. It is, overall, an entertaining if still highly juvenile monster romp.

Those ugly space aliens from the doomed Third Planet of the Black Hole system (from the previous film, Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla) have returned and created a new mecha-monster with the head of the original robot, which Godzilla had destroyed. However, to avoid the prior pitfalls of a purely robotic construct, they opt to use a living being as its control center, in the person of Katsura Mafune (Tomoko Ai), the daughter of disgraced scientist Shinzo Mafune (Akihiko Hirata), who was cast out of the scientific community because of his radical beliefs about mind control and the existence of a dinosaur called Titanosaurus. Mafune is happy to help the aliens because they have saved Katsura's life on more than one occasion--in effect, turning her into a cyborg. Katsura herself is ambivalent until she finds herself attracted to Professor Ichinose (Katsuhiko Sasaki), who is leading the search for Titanosaurus. The Black Hole guys unleash MechaGodzilla and Titanosaurus on Tokyo, but Godzilla appears to tangle with them, and Katsura is electrocuted. Once again, the Black Hole guys restore her, but now she is more mechanical than human. Ichinose has faith in her humanity, however, and in the end, she kills herself, allowing Godzilla to destroy MechaGodzilla II. Dr. Mafune is killed as Ichinose and Interpol destroy the aliens' base. Titanosaurus falls into the sea, and Godzilla returns to Monster Island, or wherever he happens to reside at this go-round.

The people scenes in Terror of MechaGodzilla to some extent mark a return to the familiar Honda style of direction, with a far grimmer atmosphere than any of the films since Godzilla vs. Hedorah. Akira Ifukube's score adds an element of the eerie in numerous scenes, and his powerful MechaGodzilla and Godzilla themes, the latter of which is based on motifs from the original Godzilla, inject a note of seriousness completely absent from other entries in the late Showa-era series. While the scenario is completely outlandish, an undeniable air of tragedy hovers over Katsura, who is at once villain and unfortunate victim of the story.

Sadly, a disproportionate number of the monster scenes fall back on the goofball antics of the previous films with effects directed by Teruyoshi Nakano. Time after time, Godzilla appears as nothing more than an empty suit, being tossed and bounced around like a helium balloon, to such embarrassing effect that even Ifukube's majestic score can't salvage the scenes. In fact, they're prevalent enough to spoil the entire picture, leaving such a bad taste that it's hard to appreciate many of the finer scenes, such as Godzilla staggering against the powerful wind whipped up by Titanosaurus's tail; or MechaGodzilla II and Titanosaurus marching side by side, razing everything in their path; or MechaGodzilla II unleashing an awesome barrage of missiles that blow a city block literally sky-high. These laughable scenes are so incompatible with the tone of the movie that, even having some understanding of how Japanese audience's expectations differ from their western counterparts, I still find the reasoning of the moviemakers utterly inexplicable. A touch of comic relief is one thing; total incongruity is another.

It doesn't help that the Godzilla suit, while a little fiercer looking than its previous incarnations in Godzilla vs. Megalon and Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla, still resembles a Muppet more than the King of the Monsters, with big, balloon-like dorsal fins and oversized, rounded feet. Titanosaurus's design is interesting enough, with fish-like fins that give it the distinct appearance of a sea animal. MechaGodzilla II, similar in appearance to the original, with a few modifications, certainly makes for an impressive mecha-monster, and in most cases, its movements are convincingly mechanical.

The Classic Media DVD includes the original, uncut Japanese version and the extended U.S. version originally released by Henry Saperstein directly to television. The Bob Conn Enterprises theatrical version, which saw only limited release in 1978, was originally known as Terror of Godzilla and was significantly edited to excise scenes of violence (and the infamous scene of Katsura's naked, obviously artificial breasts)--so much so that the ending makes no sense whatsoever. Interestingly, Saperstein's television version retained these scenes, which runs counter to expectations from that day and age, when it was typically television releases that were so heavily edited.

The Classic Media DVD release, of course, is a big winner. It does the movie justice and then some.",1280016000,4,5067,5.3275

943383,4,6304911696,"I'm not sure how many more adjectives can describe this film.  In what is a complete departure from the previous ten films in the Showa series, Terror of Mechagodzilla offers complex characters (at least in Godzilla movie terms), a brooding score by Akira Ifukube, and a sense of human tragedy.  The plot concerns a disgraced scientist who agrees to help a group of aliens destroy the world with Mechagodzilla and a dinosaur called Titanosaurus after the aliens ""save"" his daughter's life by turning her into a cyborg.  Yeah.

From a technical standpoint, the film is pretty well-made.  Ishiro Honda and Akira Ifukube both returned to the series after they last collaborated on Destroy All Monsters in 1968, so the film ""feels"" more elaborate than basically all of the 70s films.  Their returns are very much welcomed, as previous director Jun Fukuda lacked Honda's artistic touch when it came to kaiju films.  Terror of Mechagodzilla has several very striking scenes in it, namely Godzilla's first appearance (which is absolutely brilliantly filmed), the destruction of Tokyo by Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus, and Titanosaurus rising out of the water at the film's start.

For a Showa era Godzilla film, Terror of Mechagodzilla is a pretty bleak affair, probably due to Yukiko Takayama's script (most of the previous films had been written by Senichi Sekizawa, who brought a sense of humor and fun to the series).  Suicides, shoot-outs, love affairs, espionage, graphic surgeries, and even human slavery are tossed about in the film, making it the most serious entry in the series since Mothra vs. Godzilla eleven years earlier; the difference is that Mothra vs. Godzilla wasn't downright macabre like this film is.  The cyborg Katsura, as played memorably by Tomoko Ai, is easily one of the most tragic characters in a Godzilla film.  Themes of dehumanization are constantly brought up, as she struggles to find some sense of morality and loyalty (either to the humans or the aliens) during all the chaos.

Unfortunately, the camp elements of the Showa series also rear their ugly head and clash with the dark seriousness of the film; obviously.  Once again, aliens are involved in a plot to take over the world, the same aliens, in fact, from the previous film Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (although here they don't turn into apes when they die).  We can tell they're aliens because they wear silver jumpsuits and silly helmets straight out of an Ed Wood movie.  Dr. Mafune is played to extreme camp by series regular Akihiko Hirata, who would unfortunately die just before the Heisei series was kicked off.  While Godzilla himself is a bit more serious this time around, he still has the goofy ""muppet"" look that was left over from the previous two films.  Toho would have been wise to update his costume, because those puffy dorsal spikes just don't look good.  The monster fight scenes play the same as most Showa films, with the monsters fighting the way humans would, though it is nice to see Godzilla fight two bad guys at once.

Despite being one of the better films of the late Showa era, Terror of Mechagodzilla became the worst-grossing Godzilla film to date, not even selling a million tickets in its native Japan.  Worse still was the way the film was hacked up for its American release.  When Godzilla waded off into the sunset at the end, he was going into a nine-year hiatus and would not return until the excellent reboot Godzilla 1985 (released in Japan in 1984).  Despite its box office failure, Terror of Mechagodzilla is an oddly engaging, if extremely flawed, kaiju film.  The Classic Media DVD is pretty much the only version of it worth buying, as it finally restores the film to its original state and fixes many continuity errors and plot holes in the US version.  Recommended, overall.",1262563200,,3813,4.921875
943433,3,6304911696,"""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" features the return of fan favorite Mechagodzilla. This is a direct sequel to ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"", and while this film does stand on its own, it makes for a much better viewing experience when it's watched back to back with the first film.

Basically a group of aliens want to tear down old Tokyo and replace it with one of their own cities. They hope to use the off-line Mechagodzilla (now controlled by the good looking daughter of a mad scientist) and a newly discovered giant reptile that lives on the bottom of the ocean named Titanosaurus. The only thing standing in their way is Godzilla.

This is a fun little flick. There are some great fight scenes, the special effects are on par with the rest of the series. The Titanosaurus is pretty impressive looking, and while not exactly a top notch fighter, he's still a cool addition to Godzilla's list of foes. Mechagodzilla isn't as impressive as he was in his debut, but he still looks cool as hell.

One of the best aspects of this film is the opening 10 minutes or so where the viewer is treated to a nifty little Godzilla montage featuring the history of Tokyo's gigantic menace turned friend. I see some reviews carried over from older DVD listings. Just to clarify, this DVD (in the silver packaging with the original Japanese post art in the center) is the uncut original version. You can access both the original Japanese film with English subtitles or watch the Americanized dubbed version. 3 out 5 stars on it's own, 4 out of 5 when watched with ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"" together.",1262563200,2,1584,4.7111913357400725

Mechagodzilla (MG2 per an insignia on his arm) looks great, all robotic fury and icy malevolence.  He's the star of the show here.  Godzilla's look is a modified version of the previous film's design.  Titanosaurus is okay but I just can't seem to make myself like him.  Sure, his backstory (a dinosaur forced to attack mankind by alien invaders) is interesting & his design is decent enough but... I don't know.  Maybe it's that silly roar or maybe it's his ""power tail.""  The spfx are generally executed well.  As usual, there's a lot of impressive pyro on display here.  The scene where Mechagodzilla decimates city blocks is definitely a highlight.  I have to say, the aliens do look rather silly in their 1930's era space invader helmets.  Also, the scene where Godzilla is repeatedly knocked into the air does not work at all.

The story revolves around the aliens of the third planet from the black hole who plan on rebuilding Mechagodzilla and team up with Titanasorus (dinosaur/sea horse mix) to destory Tokyo and rebuild it as their new home. Their home is fading into the black hole and Earth and Tokyo has been chosen as their new home.

This movie has been ravaged by US censors, and most people have never seen the real thing, complete and uncut.  Excessive violence, a suicide storyline, and the infamous ""plastic boobs"" scene all fell under the censors knife, considered to be too much for a ""kid's film"", although Japanese children seemed to be just fine with it.

Here at last with the Japanese-language release do we get the whole thing.  The last film directed by Godzilla creator Honda Ishiro, and the last film of the Showa series, ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" is a back-to-basics flick, continuing the return to the darker and more violent origins of a monster who had drifted into kid-friendly territory like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-Godzilla/dp/B00066KWCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of Godzilla</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Monsters-Attack-aka-Godzilla-s-Revenge/dp/B00125WAYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Monsters Attack (aka Godzilla's Revenge)</a>.

The story features the return of the aliens from Planet 3 in the Black Hole.  Unable to defeat Godzilla on their own, and thus conquer the planet, they enlist the aid of Dr. Mafune who has control over a massive aquatic dinosaur-like monster called Titanosaurus.  Mafune is angry at all of mankind, and is willing to use his cyberneticaly-enhanced daughter (plastic boobs!) Katsura to further his revenge.  The aliens rebuild Mechagodzilla, and pair him with Titanosaurus to attack Japan.  The army does their best to repell the assault, but clearly they are not up to the task.  Then suddently, up from the depths, 30 stories high....

""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" is nothing but Godzilla goodness.  An interesting plotline building on earlier films, no stock footage or kid sidekicks, giant men in suits beating each other up and getting stompy with toy tanks and buildings, it really has everything you could possibly need.  I am an unabashed fan of Mechagodzilla, and this movie gives the big guy plenty of action.  The re-designed version, dubbed ""Mechagodzilla 2"", has all sorts of cool features and is an improvement over the previous incarnation.

The DVD is of amazing quality, and Classic Media's Godzilla releases are what fans have been clammoring for years.  Picture, audio, everything is perfect.

First I'll tell you about the English dubbed version. The film starts off in 1:66.1 widescreen with some amateurish narration showing clips from Godzilla's Revenge and Invasion Of The Astro Monster. Then the familiar opening scene with highlights from Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla. When the opening credits are done the picture converts to Tohoscope 2:35.1. I won't go into spoilers, but there's a lot of stuff that was going on during the film that I didn't even know was happening because they were blocked by the inferior fullscreen presentation.  There are also quick shown extra scenes and dialogue. The Bonus features for the English version are a commentary, art gallery, and a documentary, The Women of Godzilla. Now for the Japanese version. Basically the same movie minus the boring montage and of course more convincing due to  hearing the actual voices of the actors. This is the version with the infamous revealed breasts on the operating table. For concerned parents like me, don't worry (too much) and for perverts like me, don't get excited. The boobs are plastic, strongly resembling the kind you can buy at a novelty store. Bonus features are art gallery, minus the commentary and the addition of the Japanese theatrical trailer.  A film that seemed some what low key due to previous inferior releases is now vindicated with great picture and sound. This is the dvd version definately worth getting.

943525,4,6304911696,"The film takes too long to get going.  And as other have pointed out, you don't get to see Godzilla until about 2/3 into the film(unless you count the US prelude of stock footage, which is fun, or the credits sequence).  But that last 3rd has lots of monster action and really has a wonderful 3-way battle including a scene where Mecha-G just unloads on Godzilla with tons of firepower.  For casual G-fans like me, it's worth adding to your collection cause these dvd's are put togther quite nicely and at a very affordable price(got mine for under $12).  I have only 4 from this collection but plan on completing it.

Besides picture quality, subtitles for Japanese version, and widescreen presentation, these dvd's don't skimp on extras either.  There's a 2-member(Keith Aiken & Bob Johnson) audio commentary on the US version that sounds too scripted for my tastes, but on the plus side it's very informative and worth a listen.  There's also an image gallery complete with liner notes.  Here's where it gets weird though: my copy says it has the original Japanese trailer on the back of the dvd case, but i can't find it.  However, in its place is the featurette ""Women of Godzilla"".  10 minutes of cute, attractive Japanese starlets kinda make up for a trailer imho.  All i can say is...Mie Hama!!!

Though this is the last original Godzilla, he's as cool as ever here.

the things missing in this particular episode/movie:

Titanosaurus, looks cool, but is weak (as someone mentions, he's not a fighting monster)--he is like King Sesar from the first Godzilla v. Mechagodzilla: looks cool, all bite, no fight.

second--I don't buy that Godzilla would have a hard time fighting Titanosaurus, even with Mechagodzilla's help. the fan-like wind-producing weapon cannot possibly blow the Big G over! ...

I found it pathetically laughable when Titanosaurus bit Godzilla and lifted him with his jaws!  Those must be incredible jaws.....but, at least Titanosaurus has a cool monster sound.

Mechagodzilla Two is weak too.  I don't understand is, how all the weaponary didn't affect/harm Godzilla as much as it did the first time around. (although it was quite funny when at one point of the fight sequence, part of the Big G's costume burned out of control)

  The battles between the Big G and Mecha II and Titanosaurus were rushed.  Wow. so what, Mecha II had a small surprise after Big G defeated him!  They could have used Mecha II in a different way....but, oh well.

This movie focused too much on the humans and alien ""interaction"", and it was NOT well done. (although it was cool that the Captain of the aliens is the same actor as movie I; though what happened to the monkey-changing special effects? DARNED, I missed that!)

Not too good, unfortunately, for a Godzilla film; I'd rate it almost as bad as ""Godzilla's Revenge"".

other minor complaint: you were forced to listen to the English dubbing, I much prefer The original Japanese voices for such an occasion. oh well.",1161907200,2,1726,4.859589041095891

943530,4,6304911696,"""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" was the last Godzilla film of the ""Showa Era"", the first series of Godzilla movies. As stated above, it would be a decade before Godzilla arose again, and this was the last Godzilla film that depicted Godzilla as a defender of the planet. It can be argued that Godzilla was also a defender of the planet in later films, but this was the last one where he was a ""willing"" hero, instead of being forced into the role by circumstances.

That being said, this remains one of my favorite Godzilla films, in spite of its flaws, one of which is the footage that was removed for the american version. I have never seen the original version, so I can't really comment on what's missing. In some places the poor editing really shows, particularly when Katsura is being chased during Titanosaurus' first attack, and later at the end in Mifune's basement when the interpol agent seems to magically teleport around the room.

The plot is fairly straightforward: The aliens still want to conquer Earth, and as they rebuild Mechagodzilla, they recruit Dr. Mifune, who controls Titanosaurus. Titanosaurus is perhaps the most annoying Godzilla villain of all time: his roar sounds to me like what an elephant would sound like if it tried to imitate a hyena. Despite the title, Godzilla and Mechagodzilla really aren't in this movie all that much, it's Titanosaurus who seems to have the most screen time, and I privately believe that this is to raise the audience's ire with him.

All in all, this film starts off slow, but builds momentum quickly as it races toward the final action sequences. There's plenty of human drama, of course, and the actors are competent even if the characters are somewhat forgettable. The only thing that really got to me was Ichinose's pining over Katsura. As usual, there are is plenty of unitentionally funny dialogue, such as when Ichinose is trying to convince his colleagues that Katsura didn't sabotage the supersonic wave generator.

I know I probably don't have any business enjoying this film as much as I do, but something keeps me coming back. Overall, it's an enjoyable carefree movie, and I can't think of much more you can ask for from a Godzilla movie.",1147824000,2,2207,4.8153034300791555

I guess there was just too much suicide in this movie or something.

943582,3,6304911696,"For a Godzilla movie, this movie didn't do much for me. First thing that got me about this movie was that Godzilla doesn't come on at all until the end of the movie. Most of the time it is Titanisaurus, a new monster, causes the havoc in Japan. This is the only Godzilla movie I can think of that doesn't have much of Godzilla in it. It didn't make sense to start the movie off with a fight between Godzilla and Mechagodzilla but I suppose it was giving you some Godzilla at the start so you wouldn't notice his absence through out the rest of the movie. I understand that technically this is not a ""Godzilla"" movie but more of a ""Mechagodzilla"" movie, but what good is Mechagodzilla without the big G fighting him the entire movie. Overall, its okay, it's not that bad. But the thought of no Godzilla much kind of brings the movie down to where if they did have the G in more, it would have been a lot better.

  MechGodzilla is back for a second try. Put back together after having his head ripped off in the last film. The Godzilla suit is looking ok in this one. IT's not the best of the suits, but not bad.

I mean, Godzilla was buried. Mechagodzilla didn't really do anything. He just stood there and watched Godzilla beating up Titanosaurus.

This dvd version is missing about 20 minutes of the original film. Several important scenes have been cut out, damaging the story. I have read that this was an edited version that played to the kiddies in matinees back in the day, and indeed all the missing scenes are the darker and more violent parts of the story.

The last one with King Seesar (the STUPIDEST monster yet!!) is just an AWFUL Ultraman piece of trash. This time they edit that film down not unlike the first Mad Max film was edited down to a few moments in the beginning of the Road Warrior (mercifully removing King Stupid) and tightening up the whole plot. Several campy laugh out loud stuff and some cool sci fi material make this a worth while see. How ever for about ten minutes or more the sound turns to crap in the sony dub and nobody bothered to fix it! How could you not notice the dump in sound? Tracking problems that was never corrected.

943624,3,6304911696,"This is one of the more confusing Godzilla films. In essence it revolves around the return of Mechagodzilla, who had his head ripped off by Godzilla and was thrown into the Pacific Ocean, recuperating with the help of some space aliens from a black hole who look like refugees from the Ultraman set, teaming up with Titanosaurus, a 1/3 fish, 1/3 dinosaur, 1/3 platypus, all ridiculous looking creature controlled by the evil and crazy Dr. Mafune and his half-cyborg daughter. Confused? I am not surprised.
Eventually there is a big three way WWF tag team match at the end featuring all three monsters (remember, Godzilla is good now...) using their laser eyes, fingertip missiles, tail fan accessory, and joined by some Japanese Air Defense Force F-4 Phantom fighters and a helicopter with a mind control beam.
The plot is pretty melodramatic with the Camaro-driving Interpol guy (who with his partner look like the Japanese Starsky and Hutch) in love with the half cyborg Katsura uttering the tender line ""Even if you're a cyborg, I still love you!"" Not the worst Godzilla movie, but one of the more boring entries in the genre. Three stars.",1088294400,5,1142,4.891752577319588

943627,2,6304911696,"I can't believe how boring this movie is.  Right off the bat, you should know that Godzilla isn't the star of this movie.  With that out of the way, you should prepare yourself for a typical sci-fi flick, because Godzilla is hardly in this movie.
The Human Scenes are, for the most part, serious.  The only humour to be found is in the way the aliens dress up (dark sunglasses, large helmets with horns, white sneakers, etc).  Also, the way they laugh is somewhat funny.  Apart from that, this is a serious movie.  And it's not very engaging.  It's actually quite boring.
The Monster Scenes are seriously lacking.  Sure, the movie opens up with recycled highlights from the previous movie ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla,"" but after that, Godzilla doesn't appear until the 46th minute.  Well, actually, he only appears for the 2 minutes there because the other monster withdraws.  So, we don't really see Godzilla until the 55th minute to be sure.  Until that moment, you see a few scenes of Titanosaurus not doing too much.  Oh, did I tell you that Mechagodzilla does NOTHING until the 55th minute?  So until the end of the movie, you're left with boring Human Scenes that don't exactly entertain the audience between Monster Scenes.
To be fair, the climactic fight (the ONLY fight actually) that begins on minute 55 is quite decent.  Also, it lasts until the 77th minute.  Still, this doesn't make-up for the lack of Monster Action throughout the movie's duration.
[The Monster Scenes during the movie consist of Monster vs. Monster, Monster vs. Alien/Mankind, and Monster Trashing City]
In any case, the Human Scenes don't flow very well with the Monster Scenes.  And Godzilla seems to be thrown into the movie from 'out of the blue' - very poor integration of the main character.
Make no mistake: the climactic battle is decent, but that's really the only Monster Action you see throughout the entire movie.  And let me just stress the fact that Godzilla doesn't even feel like a real player in this movie.  They really did a poor job integrating Godzilla into this movie which is supposedly a sequel to ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.""  This movie is ultimately boring, and not worth a repeat viewing.
This is not a fun Godzilla movie.",1077840000,5,2233,4.813648293963254
943628,2,6304911696,"""The Terror of MechaGodzilla"" is a very forgettable Godzilla movie that unfortunately marked the last appearance of Godzilla in the original series (which lasted from 1954 to 1975). Like most Godzilla movies from the 1970s, the story has something to do with an alien invasion. It also involves a prehistoric dinosaur called ""Titanosaurus"" rampaging around Tokyo. MechaGodzilla, Godzilla's mechanical clone, comes along for the ride, this time being controlled by the aliens.
The alien invasion story in this movie is simply not interesting, engaging, or funny. Mostly, it's just boring. The monster action is curiously kept to a minumum, and besides the opening credits (which are mostly stock footage from the previous entry, ""Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla""), Godzilla himself doesn't show up until the 47 minute mark.
The DVD is unfortunately not presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It is shown in a severely cropped 1.33:1 version. The picture is quite scratchy with muted colours, although I must confess, it was a bit better than I expected it to be. The only special feature is a preview for the ""Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters"" video game, but that isn't particularly special if you ask me.",1072828800,,1206,5.221649484536083

There were extras, but the only options were to change the sound quality from mono to surround sound, and a sneak peak at the new Destroy All Monsters Melee game. The quality of the DVD was poor; it was fuzzy, dirty, and pan-and-scanned. However, it's still a great classic and one of Gojira's greatest movies (IMO ^_^). This is overall is a fun lil DVD, but if extras are your thing (they're mine, too), check out the Terror Of Mechagodzilla DVD from Simitar.

943693,4,6304911696,"Overall, this last film in the original Godzilla series is one of the better ones, due primarily to the fight scenes.  If you've seen Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla, though, you pretty much know the plot in this one; aliens from ""the black hole"" are once again trying to conquer Earth with their mechanized Godzilla monster.  The only significant difference between this film and its predecessor is the addition of the monster Titanosauras.  The brilliant scientist who discovered the living dinosaur Titanosauras turned away from mankind when his colleagues ridiculed his theories; now his daughter, his only companion for 15 years, can somehow control Titanosauras.  The aliens, who are rebuilding the vanquished MechaGodzilla, recruit the evil scientist for their cause, believing Godzilla cannot possibly defeat both monsters single-handed.
Titanosauras is a pretty cool monster at first, but he loses his charm toward the end of the film.  He has basically no offensive weapons (being a peaceful dinosaur by nature) except for a fan-like tail he uses to produce a powerful wind.  MechaGodzilla is as impressive as ever but is basically the same creature he was in the previous movie.  Godzilla looks pretty good and seems to be in fine form, despite the unsurprising setbacks he encounters in the opening moments of the battle.  I love the grand entrance he makes here; he unleashes his breath from the shadows, then the camera quickly zooms to his eyes.  Some say Godzilla is meaner in this movie, but I don't necessarily think so.  When you encounter both MechaGodzilla and Titanosauras together, it probably doesn't do much to brighten your day.  While the fighting is pretty good, MechaGodzilla just didn't seem to have his heart in the fight this time around.  He basically just stands there unleashing his arsenal of weapons, eschewing the different forms of attack he showed us in his first encounter with Godzilla.
This movie just seems to lack something, but I can't say for sure what it is.  The movie seems to end very quickly, yet it is of a comparable length with other Godzilla movies.  I think part of the problem is the fact that we have seen most of this before--space aliens controlling MechaGodzilla, agents searching for the alien base of operations, etc.  Had I seen this movie before watching Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla, maybe my feelings would be reversed, but I consider the first movie to be far superior to this one.  This is not to say that this is a bad movie; it is in fact better than most of the original series of 15 films, and it is historically important because it is the last of those 15.  We would not see Godzilla again for 10 years after this movie, so certainly Terror of MechaGodzilla is a film you will want to add to your Godzilla collection.",1019260800,12,2784,4.901918976545843
943694,3,6304911696,"Godzilla quietly took a long sabbatical after ""starring"" in this juvenile sci-fi thriller, but he goes out covered in glory.  Evil aliens using a giant super robot armed with missile firing fingers attack Earth.  To maximize the suspense, a pre-Spielberg dinosaur from the ocean depths called Titanosaurus joins Mechagodzilla in the alien conquest.  Dr. Mifune controls the sea beast, but he is in league with the bad guys.  If you look close, you can see that the same actor who played Dr. Serizawa in the orginal Godzilla film plays Dr. Mifune.  In a sense, the series came full circle with this flick.  Earth needs Godzilla to fight for our side.  Remember the days when Godzilla was the menace?  Although a low-budget effort, this entry is better than the usual wacky monster mash from TOHO.  In a nod to tradition, Tokyo suffers destruction.  Buildings crumble, tanks fire their guns, and jetfighters launch rockets.  As the monsters fight, fire rages through the industrial part of town.  The only thing missing is Raymond Burr.  Classic Godzilla music sets the mood.  The battle scenes are loud, thrilling, and explosive.  They also are occasionally comic.  There is only so much the director can do with actors in rubber monster suits.  This genre, to be honest, offers a peculiar type of entertainment.  True fans appreciate the nuances.
