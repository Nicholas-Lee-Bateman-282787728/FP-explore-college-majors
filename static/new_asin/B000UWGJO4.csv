This video does exactly what we hoped it would do, show us how to make the soups and appetizers we order when we go get Chinese Take-out.

The video stresses that off the shelf mixes and wrappers can be used (most of the examples do use store bought components), but they also show the ingredients used in the store bought items. The video shows almost every step in real time, with very few cut aways. This can get a little tedious, like when she is making egg dough or folding 5 Egg Rolls, but it isn't too bad. They also do a comparison to ""actual Take-out"" and what they made on the video, which is interesting.

Some things to note:

* The ingredient list is very quickly shown at start of section, so it is best to pause and write them down because they are not always identified as the dish is being prepared.

* They also point you to their web site for spice and ingredient info. I should note that there is a lot of good information and tips on the site.

* The video was shot without benefit of a tripod, so it can be a little jumpy and a little distracting

* The background music is somewhat repetitive and also a little distracting

This is a very good video and it does exactly what it advertises, teach you how to quickly make popular Take-out soups and appetizers. It did not show ""Hot and Sour"" soup (my favorite), but did include Egg Drop and Wanton.

Highly recommended!",1232409600,3,1658,4.896428571428571
8215335,5,B000UWGJO4,"Although I've always appreciated the art of cooking (and not to mention I love to eat!) I never enjoyed cooking.  In fact, I hated it.  I never had the patience for it, nor did I ever enjoy the mess I had to clean up afterwards.  For whatever reason, I decided to try this volume of a series on preparing Chinese food at home.  I figured since I spend so much money on a weekly basis ordering it and tipping a driver, why not try to overcome my aversion and learn it myself?  It turns out to be the smartest move I made all year.  Once I got all the tools and ingredients, following this video was so easy and SO rewarding in terms of what I accomplished.  The food I prepared by following this video was without a doubt as good if not better than any take-out place I've ever ordered from, and I am NOT a good cook by any means!  I can't wait to try the rest of this series, and thank you to the people who released this series!",1200873600,5,929,4.065934065934066
