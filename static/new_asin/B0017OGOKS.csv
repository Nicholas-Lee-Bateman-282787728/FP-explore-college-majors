8266696,1,B0017OGOKS,"Nice video, BUT the description says 'high def' and this definitely IS NOT high def.  It iss instead analog broadcast TV quality at 720x480p resolution

At the very least, the description is misleading, at the worst is is fraudulent

===============
From the desciption -

Jackson Blue Cave, also known as Blue Springs Cave, on Merritt's Mill Pond in Marianna has been described as the most beautifully decorated of all of florida's caves. In this video you can enjoy a scooter ride from the cavern zone to the end of the gold line - at 4450 feet - all shot in crystal clear High Definition Video!

8266697,5,B0017OGOKS,I own the DVD of this download.  It's a great way to re-live diving inside of Jackson Blue Cave whenever I get cabin fever up in Ohio.  You guys did a good job with this one!  Thanks!  Makes me want to pack up and set my cruise control south for Marianna!,1233878400,,255,3.9411764705882355
