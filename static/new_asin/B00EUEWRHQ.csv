5944133,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"I am so glad I bought this!

The Disc: New condition & played well. Just your normal disc.

The Content:
Wow! After watching all eight seasons of House and then going directly to this. . . just a huge smile! Hugh doesn't sing your typical songs, and he does quite well with the bluesy music. He plays the piano. He dances a bit. He can't stop smiling and the joy he's feeling exudes not only across the live audience, but to the viewer of the disc! The ensemble band look like they are having a great time and bring such an authentic sound to the music. Seriously made me want to start dancing, too (and I don't dance). The ladies who sing are a lovely treat to the ears.
My husband actually started watching this with me, and he isn't normally ""into"" my music videos, but he said he rather enjoyed it.

There's an included interview with Hugh Laurie, that's very. . . ""high brow"" to my mind, but he is just so much fun to watch, and still slips jokes into the interview with his impeccable comedic timing. I was very glad to have this feature available to watch.

If you're looking for something different from what plays endlessly on the radio, this is it! A nice variety of bluesy/jazz songs, and Hugh sings with an unexpected voice (a little nasally for my tastes, but it's Hugh Laurie, so I'll take it!) that lets you ""feel"" what he is singing.",1420848000,2,1349,4.362549800796812

5944138,5,B00EUEWRHQ,This to me is absolutely a great live concert by Hugh Laurie. It is how he presents the songs more than his actual singing and playing that just makes it for me. So enjoyable to watch again and again. The visuals just helped me enhance the CD that I also bought. I very highly recommend this.,1413936000,,292,4.232142857142857
5944139,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"I had no idea that Hugh Laurie was so gifted. When I stumbled on an article on the internet about his album ""Let them talk"" and then when I found the sound track for the Saint Louis Blues, I was truly amazed and immediately purchased all three of his albums that are available. After playing all three albums I firmly believe I got more than my monies worth. I can't wait for his next album. These comments are from a guy who wasn't into Blues type music. ""I am now""",1413849600,,466,4.188888888888889
5944140,4,B00EUEWRHQ,I saw Hugh Laurie and the Copper Bottom Band live here in CA this Spring.  This recording brought back good memories of the live performance and many of the songs we heard.,1412985600,,172,4.375
5944141,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"I'm a recent Hugh Laurie fan and found this to be very enjoyable. Some songs were a repeat of another CD.  I had hoped they'd all be new, but considering the venue, I can understand him playing some of his popular pieces.",1411689600,,221,4.261904761904762
5944142,4,B00EUEWRHQ,"Hugh Laurie and musicians gave a good preformance, and live preformance enjoyed by guests and myself.",1411344000,,101,5.375
5944143,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"Great concert, even better than the second studio album.
Hugh Laurie is improving, and this concert proves it.

The only complain i have to do is about the bluray boxes the american industry always uses, a this cheap one, as it appears to be mabe by paper as the plastic is so soft you can shred with your own hands. I always exchange these boxes for a decent hard ones.",1411344000,,370,4.285714285714286
5944144,2,B00EUEWRHQ,Sound level is extremely low on this Blu-Ray. You will need maximum volume on your system to listen to it comfortably,1410825600,,117,4.619047619047619
5944145,3,B00EUEWRHQ,Like his Dixie blues better,1408060800,,27,4.6
5944146,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"This is a very well done Blu-Ray concert.  Audio and mixing are spot on and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is also very good.  I've only listened to this album through my 2ch system VIA my Oppo 103 to my Musical Fidelity M1 SDAC so I can't comment on any multichannel playback.  It does list DTS-HD Master as an audio option but it does list if it's 2ch or Multi.

As with most acts, I prefer live albums to a studio release.  More energy and a raw beauty to the music that is MENT to be there, not a polished and sometimes flat recording that you all to often get from too much time in the studio.

You can clearly see and feel that Hugh and his copper bottom band have a great time playing live and entertaining a crowd.  This recording does a great job highlighting each band member and lets all of them show off here and there.  Gabby Moreno has been a very welcome addition to the line up and she adds a sultry layer to the band that works great with Jean McClain's power house vocals.

This recording shows how Hugh has grown in terms of his vocals and how he just as much as anyone in the audience, loves to sit back and watch his band show their stuff and just enjoy the music.

If you're looking for something that you can sit down and be glued to your system while you critically listen this is a great album.  If you're looking for something that you can turn on and enjoy while you get stuff done around the house or as background music for any reason, this is still a great album.  You would have to me a pretty close minded individual to not be able to enjoy this in my opinion.",1406160000,5,1599,4.169381107491857
5944147,4,B00EUEWRHQ,"I am a fan of Hugh Laurie... I noticed in someone's review, they said that he seemed smug / smiled as if he were showing off, etc...  I do not believe this to be true... When you are playing music / jamming with friends and making great music, smiles and good times happen...  Track 2 is my Favorite... It was a good show / concert for me...",1405468800,,341,4.074626865671642

I read the DVD in my Notebook, then HDMI cable for TV, TV connected to HT and.... ready to enjoy!!!

Thanks",1402358400,,214,4.631578947368421
5944152,4,B00EUEWRHQ,"This is a very good concert for those who did not have the opportunity to watch him (and his great band) play live! He creates an energy and a synergy with the crowd that was not captured well in the DVD and/or Blu-ray! Maybe the Queenmary was not the best place for the concert, don't know! So, if you have the opportunity to see him playing live, I can guarantee you will have much more fun! Otherwise buy this fantastic concert and imagine yourself right in the middle of the crowd!!",1398988800,,486,4.351648351648351
5944153,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"I really enjoyed this musical entertainment in a way I haven't seen in a long time.
if you like the old fashioned blues style, I'm confident you will like this, I was amazed
that Hugh Laurie could sing this type of songs, I had heard him on ""Jeeves & Wooster""
but I was delighted with him & his group on this DVD, I do recommend this, good price, great entertainment,
(style might surprise) what is not to like?",1389657600,,411,4.282051282051282

5944155,5,B00EUEWRHQ,A fun evening was spent watching Hugh Laurie and his incredibly talented band of musicians perform on the Queen Mary. Each musician was so talented. I especially enjoyed the trombone-playing woman. Wow; never heard anything like her before!,1388707200,6,240,5.342105263157895
5944156,5,B00EUEWRHQ,I knew I'd like the blu-ray because I attended the concert in person and had a blast.  I like this cd better than Hugh's first because of the new female singer and use of both female vocalists. The songs are great and it's clear that Hugh and the band are having a blast! The concert was great and I highly recommend the dvd and the cd.,1388620800,,336,4.090909090909091

5944158,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"I'm not objective about Hugh Laurie; I think he's brilliant.  That said, while I like the selections on the first cd a bit better, the fine musicians, the songs and the setting make this a unique experience.",1387065600,,207,4.594594594594595
5944159,4,B00EUEWRHQ,The talented Mr. Laurie. Performance is 5 stars. Video quality is why I gave it 4. It would have been fantastic to have been there in person.,1386892800,,141,4.2592592592592595
5944160,5,B00EUEWRHQ,Perfect quality and a very nice and proffessional show with a bit of a merry disorder. 5 stars to Hugh!,1386633600,,103,4.2
5944161,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"If you're a kindred spirit with House's musical sensibilities, then buy this puppy. Very nice tour band he put together. All the players have chops to spare but Gaby Moreno and Jean McClain, the vocalists, and the trombone player are stand-outs for me. Heartfelt stuff well played. Laurie's previous exploration of NOLA, which includes Allen Toussaint, is also a little gem.",1386547200,,374,5.147540983606557
5944162,4,B00EUEWRHQ,"British-born Hugh Laurie is best known in the US as an actor for his eight years playing a doctor on the TV comedy series ""House"" According to Wikipedia, ""He has been listed in the 2011 Guinness Book of World Records as the most watched leading man on television and is one of the highest-paid actors in a television drama, earning 250,000 ($409,000) per episode"" for the series. His career started in England as half of the comic team Fry & Laurie (with Stephen Fry- whose BBC travelogues only show up in the US on BBC America). But Laurie ventured into music and released two albums of New Orleans - style blues and pop with his band, The Copper Bottom Band.  There was a PBS special about New Orleans music and now this Blue-ray of a performance he gave on the Queen Mary (no longer sailing the ocean but now a hotel moored in Huntington Beach, California).

As the 106-minute performance began, I felt that Laurie's talent was ""just okay"" - he's not a great vocalist and an okay pianist - and his ego became annoying to me. He talks about the great musicians in the band (who, honestly, were the reason I liked the performance as it progressed) but didn't bother to name them at the outset. Like a few other British musicians (pianist Jon Cleary comes first to my mind) Laurie just loves the piano music of NOLA legend Professor Longhair as well as the blues of Ray Charles, and that shows throughout the evening. If you look at the audience on the QM you will realize that they are here to see ""Dr. House"" perform and, if they learn about some great music through that experience, the show will have served its purpose. The same goes with the DVD or BD.  There's nothing on the cover to tell the buyer they are going to be introduced to some great songwriters that they never heard of.

The DVD/BD comes with a bonus interview (20 minutes) in which a female interviewer (who does not identify herself) mentions that the show aired on PBS and asks about his music. Laurie comes across (at least to me) as ""flip"" and sardonic, almost like his ""House"" character. Laurie fans will appreciate the bonus, though it didn't add much info for me.

Unlike the previous reviews here, I can't give this five stars. It's all subjective but - again - I found Laurie's ""celebrity"" attitude a bit to overpowering. (Look at me, I can act AND play the piano). It was the band that really provided the reason to watch this, in my opinion.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5944163,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"Great blues video.  The cover photo shows one man but this video is about a band with a leader and has all the appearance and sound of an experienced, polished band.  Laurie is the band leader and also a band member here and has definitely grown from his earlier music releases.  His audience performance is more polished and professional, as you would expect from a band playing on the Queen Mary.  Several band members, including Laurie,  change instruments from time to time and show their varied skills.  The vocals are shared and all first class.  You will want the CD of this!  Many songs you might not recognize but all are well done with true deep blues feeling.  All the arrangements are uniquely done in a pleasing way emphasizing the musicians' skills and instruments.  I enjoyed my evening with this video and look forward to more in the future.",1385683200,13,857,4.691275167785235
5944164,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"This edition is sooooooo great. Watching this I was again on the concert of Mister Hugh Laurie and THE COPPER BOTTOM BAND. 18 wonderful songs + interview, I really like it!",1385510400,,172,4.580645161290323
5944165,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"Hugh Laurie and the Copper Bottom Band never fail to deliver, whether in the recording studio or live on stage, and 'Live on the Queen Mary' is no exception.  Hugh says it is a dream come true for him to do a live show in the same room, on the same stage, that re-launched the career and popularity of Professor Longhair, the icon of New Orleans Blues music.  The reverence with which he speaks of Fess, the awe he feels at actually being there, is immediately obvious to the viewer.  And he brings his love of this music to the stage with every song played, every word spoken.  The quality of the Blu-ray DVD is of the highest caliber, the image and color clear and life-like.  But it the performance of Hugh Laurie, with 'the best band in the world' behind him, that makes this DVD well worth the price.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves blues music, or is just a fan of Hugh.  You won't be disappointed.",1385510400,,915,4.315789473684211
5944166,5,B00EUEWRHQ,Need I say more?  One thing (among many) you can expect from this exceptionally talented man is that whatever he does he puts his whole self into the project.  His excitement is infectious. It's obvious he is loving it.,1385078400,,219,4.589743589743589
5944167,5,B00EUEWRHQ,It was all I had hoped for & more.  Great music plus a terrific interview with Hugh.  Saw the original program on PBS so was really looking forward to this.  Definitely wasn't disappointed.  Great to see Hugh & friends (CBB) enjoying themselves so much.  Recently (10/26) saw them in concert & was thrilled.  This DVD brings back wonderful memories.,1384992000,,349,4.830508474576271

8609497,5,B00EUEWRHQ,"Is there anything that Hugh Laurie, cannot do? He's a medical  Dr., a performer, an entertainer, a pianist, a comedian, a funny guy, handsome, chipper, delightful, sweet, a devoted family man. Classy, adorable, sarcastic, temperamental, vivacious, intelligent, a great dresser, friend of the Queen, kind to others and an all around great guy. This cd, is just great, fun and lively. I love it!",1495497600,,393,5.140625
