8216552,5,B0009KQOSS,"WOW!!!  The fourth and final installment of this outstanding anime series blows them all out of the water.  The evil Byoh have came to Okashima City in search of Taruto.  The final hour approaches, while friendships will soar and all will be revealed.  Is Taruto the Princess of the Kinka?  I'm not telling :)

If you like...Cutesy anime...cat-girls(Nekos)...magical adventures...then what are you waiting for?  Magical Meow Meow Taruto is definitely a worthy addition to your collection.  It has a rating of 7 and up and I am 34.  I dearly love this series and I highly recommend it.  Especially if you have kids.",1124150400,,614,4.87378640776699
