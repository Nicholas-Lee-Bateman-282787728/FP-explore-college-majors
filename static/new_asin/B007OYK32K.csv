5102124,5,B007OYK32K,"First off, the program/DVD set is an incredible investment with great value. Prior to doing this program I was a gym rat, and wanted to find a workout routine that incorporated more of my mind, as well as sculpt my body into its natural state, not into some pumped up ""meathead"" as people call it. The price of the program can't be ignored. For 108 dollars, you get 12 discs each holding at least a one hour class or meditation practice. You get a cardio DVD, strength DVD, balance DVD, and hardcore DVD as well as many others. The program puts you on the mat every day and comes with a very easy to follow calendar that explains what to do each day on the program. Traditional yoga classes can't be beat, and I've done them while on the UY program because I love the energy of being with other people. Prior to this program, I would have considered myself a beginner yogi, and now that I'm in the last phase, I feel as if my flexibility and strength have grown immensely. When going to a live class, I have no issues keeping up with my fellow practitioners whatsoever! If you're an intermediate yoga doer, you will fit right in! Each DVD is presented in an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are a part of an actual live class, and the instructor does a great job of explaining alternate poses and holds for beginners and advanced yogis alike. Bottom line, it's changed my life. Hope this helps!",1333152000,27,1401,4.413127413127413
5102125,5,B007OYK32K,"I have been doing P90X, Insanity etc. for a long time. I was looking great DVD option for Yoga and I stumbled upon this program and tried it. It has been 2+ years and I find myself doing this few times a week. The variety of programs (Strength, Flexibility, Detox, Cardio, Balance, ...) is great. The lengths are just over 1 hour. The instruction is super clear and I hardly need to look at the screen. The cueing of inhale, exhale, left, right is spotless.

I must say this is probably not the beginner program as there are not many modification discussed but if you have done some yoga in the past and looking to go to advanced beginner or intermediate level this is a great DVD.

The only downside is probably not having a live instructor to make alignments.",1496102400,,761,4.428571428571429
5102126,4,B007OYK32K,"Loving this set of workouts. I would rate this 5 stars, however I am running into problems with the dvds working properly. All of my players are rejecting some of the dvds so I can't get through some workouts. Unfortunately, I have to return and possibly try a new set. Bummer, was really loving this product.",1485907200,,309,4.535714285714286
5102127,5,B007OYK32K,"I tried the first CD tonight for the first time after a very stressful day in corporate America. I was worn out and tired but decided to eat a little dinner and give this a try, and hopefully get some energy back and relax my mind. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I LOVED IT.  I've been doing yoga for many years intermediately and spend most of my time with a personal trainer during the week which is physcially demanding.  This was a challenging session but I thought Travis was calming and supportive. I was able to do most of the workout, skipping one segment to rest  moment and worked up quite a sweat!! I really felt the vanyasia flow, which is my all time favorite type of yoga type so I am more than thrilled to get the same type of yoga workout I get from my local teacher!!

I don't recommend this for someone new to yoga, it moves at a steady pace but it's not impossible to do if you're in good shape and are new to yoga. I highly recommend and will finish the set and just circle back. If there is another set to buy I'm all in. :)",1485734400,,1048,4.097560975609756
5102128,1,B007OYK32K,I just got my set of DVDs 7 days ago and started the program only to find out that some of the DVDs are damaged. It's very frustrating to be in the middle of a workout and the DVD starts skipping or quits playing. I'm very  upset that I spent so much money on a yoga program I can't complete,1484352000,,291,3.85

5102130,5,B007OYK32K,"****I am pasting this from my Yoga Foundations review elsewhere on Amazon as I used that video in conjunction with this set****

I bought this item YEARS ago and just realized I never left a review! Preposterous considering this program changed my life.
I was at the end of my rope...
Back and hip pain from lingering skeletal issues issues during pregnancy (all of my bones in my lower back and hips would literally come out of place randomly and had to be reset by a chiropractor ) left me pretty much crippled. The strain on the rest of my skeletal system trying to keep moving caused other things like disc slippage and nerve pinches. The lack of ability to bend and move well was wreaking havoc on my health. I was plagued by CONSTANT pain and deep depression.
I was desperate.
I needed something soul felt and heaven sent.
I needed hope... and encouragement.
I needed healing.
Because I was ready to give up and die... at 36.
It was that bad...
In a last ditch effort to reclaim my life, I began researching...
Looking through all of the health and wellness programs available, I decided I wanted to try The Ultimate Yogi.
Knowing I was in no state to throw myself into an intense program unprepared (as well as afraid to invest in a costly program that I wasn't sure I could even DO), I bought Yoga Foundations to test the instructor as well as build up my strength and endurance.
I was afraid, but fiercely determined to do my best.
I decided 30 days should be enough time to prepare my body...
I participated for 30 days, daily...no matter how sore I was. I followed his instruction to the letter, easing out to child's pose whenever I needed to.
At the end of 30 days... I ordered the UY program but did another 30 days of Yoga Foundations...
I was afraid to hurt myself...
At the end of those 30 days, I was afraid I still wasn't ready...that I might never be...
I had joined the UY Facebook group and saw that a large group of members were starting the 108 on Jan. 8th...just a few days away...
I threw fear to the wind and joined that round.
For the first week I could hardly walk, but I was there...on the mat...every day. Start to finish.
Weeks 2-4 I was developing flexibility, endurance and strength at an surprising rate. By the end of the second month... astonishingly, I was strong, capable and happy. I was master of my body once again! The rest was just pure joy. Indescribable happiness, satisfaction and contentment. With the Ultimate Yogi, if you think you can, you will.
My deepest thanks to all involved.
Namaste",1480464000,8,2539,4.4838012958963285
5102131,5,B007OYK32K,"First off I LOVE Travis Eliot. If you've ever practiced yoga, then you know how IMPORTANT it is to find a good teacher that you connect with. I found Travis by sampling his yoga workouts on You Tube. It was love at first session. . He is an amazing instructor, and you can tell that yoga is a big part of his life. He is very encouraging and has a way of explaining poses that I just ""get it"" in ways I never have. If you've never done a yin yoga class, then you should try the one he has available on You Tube, it's my Sunday yoga, and I had never done a Yin class. It's nothing short of awesome. Poses are held for up to 4 mins and it really does help you to progress in your practice much quicker. I would highly suggest this to series to anyone. It might seem like a bit much for a beginner but it's easily modified for any level.",1478649600,,834,3.9702380952380953

5102133,5,B007OYK32K,"LOVE this set. Changed my life. Loosened my back, this eliminated pain, increased my strength, shed pounds, allowed me to be a better person, and calmed my mind. I've used it so much, can't wait for Travis to make a follow up set!",1473033600,,230,4.372093023255814
5102134,5,B007OYK32K,"Super program. His voice was a little hard to get used to at first, but I've learned to love his style and very, very clear instruction. I don't feel like he does a lot of different poses per se, but the timing and flow of each DVD is impeccable. Would love to see him come out with more DVD's. For those that love Travis Eliot I found that through his website ([...])  you can download videos or even just audio of over 20 workouts (>1 hour usually) for a recommended donation. I've tried lots of instructors and he's definitely near the top for me!",1472774400,,550,4.288461538461538

5102137,5,B007OYK32K,If you are a yogi this is a must for your collection. Very empowering and life changing. I did the program a year ago and am still doing the program mixed in with some of my other favs. If you are debating whether or not to purchase it is well worth the money. It is not for beginners however. Do some beginner dvds first (Tamal Dodge or Rodney Yee) to get in yoga shape. Than go for it!,1459900800,,387,3.9743589743589745
5102138,3,B007OYK32K,"This is a great workout if you are already an expert or very experienced with yoga.

 If you have any sort of limitation physically, then this is not for you. Knee problems, back problems, wrist, shoulder, elbow ...  There seems to be absolutely no time for any modification. Nor  do they show you any kind of modification.

The DVDs are extremely long, and while they require you to do an extra 20 minutes three times a week for core, they do not include that 20 minute workout in any of the other DVDs. So you will be putting in multiple DVDs during the day.  Not a big deal, but kind of a no-brainer that they missed.

I have years of experience with yoga, and I struggle with this. It is very fast-paced, there is no time for any kind of settling into poses, and there really is no meditation outside of the specific meditation DVDs.

I cannot stress enough that this program is not for people with injuries, regardless of what the instructor says.

Their suggestions regarding diet and juice fasting are laughable in their vagueness.",1459641600,5,1038,4.537634408602151
5102139,3,B007OYK32K,"This is a great all around training program-think P90x meets yoga. It's an intense but rewarding program. If you stick with the entire program you will notice the transformation.

A word of caution:  you cannot rely on the instructor to teach you the poses. You must at least have some prior knowledge of yoga.

I also bought the Yoga Foundations (same instructor) set before this one, thinking I would get a step by step on how to do the poses, but that wasn't helpful either.

There are times when the instructor goes off on a tangent with some story - this time could be better spent walking folks through the proper form of the poses for those of us who need the instruction.

As for the Discs, some of them got worn over time and very pixelated.  If you are able to make a copy, I suggest you do so when your set is new. Two of my discs are no longer playable after just one year. Not the best quality. And as far as I know, they do not replace individual discs. So I had to buy a second set.",1459382400,6,997,4.193717277486911
5102140,5,B007OYK32K,excellent yoga series.  Travis Elliot is a great instructor.  hope to attend one of his classes if I am ever in california,1458777600,,122,4.5
5102141,3,B007OYK32K,"Hmmm.  Where to start.....

This DVD set is so pretentious.  The intro video and the guy who is teaching is so over the top.  If that were the only issue I wouldn't have docked any stars because really the introduction video has nothing to do with the classes, which is why I bought it.

I hate the classes that I tried.  They're too fast.  You don't even get a moment to sink into the poses.  I hate to say it but his voice is irritating.  I know you can't help your voice but it makes it really hard to stay focused on the yoga.  The classes feel more like yoga inspired cardio.  Physically, I couldn't keep up without risking injury from being careless.  Clearly this set is intended for people who are already skilled practitioners and just want someone to tell them what pose to do because he teaches NOTHING about correct form.  I only tried a couple of classes because seriously, I hated them.

I couldn't with a clear conscience give it less than three stars, however.  The production is great.  If you're looking for yoga poses on speed this might be your cup of tea.  Clearly there are many people that like this style, although I really don't get the appeal.  And, if you can do it without injury it would obviously be an intense workout.

I wish I had known before purchasing.  This was a waste of money for me.",1457568000,5,1323,4.366255144032922

5102145,5,B007OYK32K,"I've been doing yoga for years now, and the ultimate yogi is, without any doubt, the best at home yoga you'll ever find. There are many people teaching yoga, but the way Travis puts together the serious is perfect. You'll move through flow after flow, and you'll never find yourself regretting doing it each day. It's not a comprehensive yoga program, but it's the best for a regular daily practice you'll find.

After doing this program, you'll find yourself fitting in at any yoga studio. In fact I plan to now begin yoga teacher training and I owe a large part of it to the confidence and strength this program gave me.

I'm serious when I say, if you are debating which dvd series to buy, do yourself a favor and start here. There is nothing you'll regret. You'll be making the first step on a journey to a stronger and better you.",1455926400,2,835,4.450980392156863

This set is generally excellent, and the individual workouts are great.  They're challenging, but not too much, and there is enough variety to avoid getting tired of doing the same thing.  I generally do yoga as a supplement to other exercise, both for strength and flexibility.  I want it to be challenging, but not so hard my non-yoga body can't handle it.  These were perfect in that regard.

If you actually stick to the program and do it daily (which I did not), I believe you would achieve maximum health and have basically no body fat.  I had to buy a yoga towel because of how much I sweat during this.  The Cardio program is particularly grueling - I usually can't walk very easily the next day.  But after trying the entire program, I found that the routines are just a little too lengthy and I often opt for other dvd's that have shorter program options.  Also sometimes Travis Eliot says things that annoy me, but overall he's a good teacher.  This program really does take a commitment, and I'd like to try it again.  It's just hard to do that when there are other great DVD's with different styles.

5102157,5,B007OYK32K,"In the ubiquitous world of home  fitness DVD's on the market today, none comes greater or more highly recommended from my perspective, than Travis Eliot's, ""The Ultimate Yogi"".  Travis' soothing and calm timbre help to cultivate and create and resonate a relaxed environment upon which to to practice and learn the many nuances of Yoga.

The ""Ultimate Yogi"" is a 108 day journey, in which the participant engages 6 days a week, through a plethora of various DVDS used to focus on certain areas. Each of the discs focus on a particular component to help you devlop your Yoga practice. There is Crossing Training,  Cardio, Hardcore(Ab workout), Flexibility, among others.

One of the many aspects that really separate this apart from other YOGA DVDS on the market, is the high production value that is given to each class. Each Disc has been carefully crafted with great visuals, and a very nice soundtrack to accompany the practice for each disc. Another component that is quite unique to this set, is the Pranayama Medidation Disc.  This is a wonderful disc, that is used to augment the practice of Yoga. During the 108 day journey, Travis implores you to engage inwardly by mediating. The practice initially starts at 10 minute3s, and then after a certain time is moved to 20 minutes, and finally 30 minutes of mediation AFTER your workout has concluded.

While many will argue  regarding the time commitment(when you add in the Hardcore Abs, and the mediation, you could be looking at a good 2 hours total in a workout at the last stage), but one could certainly space that time out periodically throughout the day, to help ease the time burden.

I must commend Travis highly for this product. For those of you who are familiar with Beachbody(P90X, Insanity), the product is very similar to p()X in the production aspect. Each disc, as I've alluded to is slickly produced, and just as Tony Horton would speak at the beginning of each disc for 10 seconds or so, so does Travis. Both Tony and Travis, have these catchy sayings(i.e., ""Do your best, forget the rest"", ""Be ultimate, be committed, be focused""). Ironically, both companies(Beachbody and Udaya) are both headquarted in Santa Monica as well. I would venture to guess, Travis certainly took a page out of the P90X marketing, and developed it into his own unique brand of Yoga, which is excellent from a buisness perspective.

For those of you, who have completed P90X, or are completing P90X, you can substitute Travis' Yoga Cardio or his Cross Training on the days that you have  theYoga day. It's certainly helpful, and would save you about 30 minutes, if time is an issue. If you are a Beachbody loyalst, and looking for something to challenge you, look no further. I have completed P90X, Insanity, Body Beast, and The Asylum,  completed triathlons, rowed competitively in college, and nothing, as done for my body  to make it more limber than what ""The Ultimate Yogi"" has done.

I highly recommend this program to any advanced beginners and up. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Travis' clear and concise instruction, and this program. It is hands down the best Yoga DVD on the market, and I guarantee that you will come away after completing this, with a renewed spirit, and a desire to love more compassionately your fellow man.",1437523200,14,3302,4.841918294849023
5102158,5,B007OYK32K,"This is a great yoga set.  It's tough.  You can have challenging workouts at home like you can at a yoga studio, if you don't mind repeating workouts.

You can build up your abilities and do 20 minutes per workout one week, 30 the next, etc., until you can get through the workouts.  That's what I did.  There are several workouts, one per disc.  You repeat the same workouts for several weeks, then the lineup changes.

5102161,5,B007OYK32K,"I've wanted to write a review for The Ultimate Yogi for a while because
it is simply the best power/vinyasa yoga series out there.  Not only is
the program top notch with respect to fitness but Travis has a real
sense of the meditative aspects of yoga.  Without trying to convert
you to Hinduism, his flows will inevitably bring your body, mind, and
breath into alignment...or you simply won't make it through the flow.

Now, to do the 108 days as prescribed by the program is going to be
almost impossible for all but the most flexible and fit.  So don't
get your expectations up only to have them crushed in the first few
days.  Yet, I still recommend this program to those somewhat out of
shape and carrying extra weight.  Just put together your own pre-108
day routine out of the less demanding routines - Yin, Flexibility,
and Gentle.  As you're able, alternate Yin or Gentle with the harder
flows.  Eventually you'll be ready to do the 108 days, if you want.
Prepare for child pose, modifications, and extra breaths at first!

Top Pros
* Variety of flows and routines.  Some unique sequences.
* Not all power, Yin and Gentle to restore and heal.
* Instructor has good insight into the union aspect of yoga.  He's
  also pretty funny, motivating, has some good anecdotes,
  and ways to help you find your way into the postures.

There are only a few small imperfections with the program.  The
Shavasanas are way too short.  I imagine they're trying to keep
the programs around an hour but they should have just guided you into it
and instructed you to stay as long as you want.  The camera work
and/or editing at times can focus too much on the instructor,
occasionally when you need to see the students doing what he's
describing.  But these are very minor nit picks.",1436054400,5,1773,4.568253968253968

5102170,5,B007OYK32K,"I have been an avid exerciser for 30 years, hiking, marathon running, mountain biking, road biking, and gym exercising.  Last year I was hit in an intersection by a woman who ran a red light at about 30 mph.  I am lucky to be alive; my car was hit in the driver door, my head went through the driver window (no side air bags), I was knocked into a secondary head on, and I was knocked out, my car was totaled.  My neck was literally crooked it was so badly injured.  I had huge lumps on both sides of my cervical vertebrae and my head was swollen.  I had never tried yoga before my accident, not even once.  Before the accident, I was up at 4 am doing P90 and then out the door to run 10 before heading out to work; that was my life. Now I have 5 ruptured disks in my neck and back and I am constantly battling pain and depression.  About a month after my accident I started researching and found this yoga program.  When my back and neck start spasming and get out my Travis Eliot yoga program and work through it.  If you have had a similar problem, this program may prove to be your little light at the end of a dark tunnel.  Thank you Travis, from the bottom of my heart.",1430352000,9,1175,4.069565217391304

5102172,5,B007OYK32K,"I absolutely love this dvd set.  I have not practiced yoga too much; off and on over the years.  I am 55 years old and have been in pretty good shape most of my life.  But, after experiencing the pains of cervical stenosis and not being able to exercise regularly, and poor eating habits with a high-stress job, I decided to find an exercise that would not involve the high impact of aerobics, weight training and other forms of exercise I'd practiced for over 30 years.  I decided to try yoga, again, but more seriously.  Rodney Yee's dvds were great, but the routines became too repetitive.  I stumbled onto Travis' UY and was intimidated by the ""108 days of Yoga"".  I tried it anyway, while changing the way I ate and my mindset.  I dropped 22 pounds, re-sculpted and toned my body, and have learned to focus more on my soul.  The dvds were challenging, but I never gave up.  I modified poses when necessary, but I always completed each class, entirely.  I recently finished the entire 108 days.  I was planning to go to another yoga dvd series to keep it goin'.  But, I have decided to do a 2nd round of UY 108 days of Yoga.  I can't wait to continue to improve my balance and strength.

5102176,5,B007OYK32K,"Wow! These are literally the best yoga workouts I have ever seen on DVD, and even some of the best I have ever done in a live class. They are definitely challenging and the first couple of days I was a little intimidated, but once you get the ""flows"" down the speed and intensity are actually quite a rush. I also love the program bc it has almost every kind of yoga you could imagine. It has Cardio Yoga, which is all about getting your heart rate up through repeating intense flows of yoga poses at pretty fast speeds. But then at the other end of the extreme there is Yin Yoga where each pose is held for a sometimes glorious, sometimes kind of painful (but in that oh so good way) 3 to 5 minutes. There is also a balance class, a strength class, a cross training class, a flexibility class, along with others.

Another thing I really love about these DVD's is Travis' class teaching style. Instead of most yoga DVD's where the instructor is doing the poses and he/she is either on their own or they have one or two students with them, and then the instructor does a voice over later, Travis does the DVD's like a live yoga class. There is a full class of students and instead of participating, Travis is walking among them, giving instruction. This way, he is super descriptive when he is calling out poses. This makes it very easy to follow the yoga practice without having to look at the TV, which as we all know is super helpful. I also like the fact that there are a lot of different students so you can quickly glance at different people doing the same move to see body placement, etc.

I also have to say at the beginning I kind of made fun of Travis' super positive vibe and some of the things he says, but I have to say sometimes his persona makes it a lot easier to get through a tough workout. I find myself pushing myself a lot harder during my workouts and at the same time being a lot calmer in my breathing and mindfulness during the yoga because of the things he says. So while you may think he is cheesy at the beginning, you might find it grows on you.

Anyways, if you are even a little serious about using yoga to get in shape then I say do this! I think it is great for people who are already in love with yoga, but I also think it is great for people that are looking to add more yoga into their life. I would say you probably want to have a little bit of a knowledge base before starting, so a some beginner's classes wouldn't hurt before jumping in, but I don't think any of the moves are too advanced. I also think it would be great cross training for athletes in other sports.",1428537600,7,2605,4.206
5102177,5,B007OYK32K,"Travis is a wonderful instructor - very motivating and inspiring - so we've stuck with it. This is a great program, but it's very advanced.

My wife and I are about 50 days in and we've customized the program for ourselves - We're older (50+, 60+), so we need to be careful to not overdo it and create an injury - so we don't do all of the workouts, and often we only do a portion (30 or 45 minutes).",1427932800,4,504,3.9029126213592233

They include a poster that helps you keep track of which disc to do on which day and a booklet that briefly explains the nutrition programs, etc.

I would give it 5 stars, but Travis Elliott is soooo completely annoying. I feel terrible saying that because I can tell he's put a lot into this but his voice is pretentious and the constant rambling on about far out, unnecessary crap is almost more than I can take.

I've tried doing it without sound but sometimes you need the verbal cues when you're in a pose where you can't see the screen.

So, I basically try to tune him out and do my thing. I've done it so many times I can almost do the videos without sound. I can't wait until I get to that point.

5102191,4,B007OYK32K,"Review  The Ultimate Yogi with Travis Eliot

The Ultimate Yogi with Travis Eliot is a fascinating challenge.  Uday Entertainment gives us 12 yoga workouts, two cleansing challenges, and a final of 36, then 72 then 108 sun salutations to cap each of the three segments of the program.

The Yoga workouts are good, basic and require strength, stamina and balance.  They are well video taped and the commentary to go along with them is good, and not condescending or fake golf course whispers.  Travis himself moves well, as an  experienced yoga instructor should.  The class of 16 men and women is well photographed doing the workouts.

There is both a booklet and a day by day calendar to do the workouts in sequence.  The calender is well and clearly done, telling which workout do to on each of the 108 days.  The booklet is too brief.  Therein lies my problems with this program.

The fine print on the back of the box states that this program is not for beginners.  That is fine, but should be much more obviously placed than it is.  If the practitioner is well versed in the poses, asanas, and vinyasas, and has basic strength, stamina, balance and flexibility before he/she starts, then this program will work.  The program is meant for individuals who already have the yoga experience to deal with the poses, asanas and vinyasas.  I did not find instruction in those basic principles in this program.  That is fine, if it is clearly made known in the instructions.

Travis does state once - that I found - that the practitioner should do the various programs as far as they can, and work on improving his/her performance and completing each program as indicated over the 108 days.  This was not in a prominent spot in the program or the dvds and it should be.

The program is self is good, and if the practitioner is ready with the knowledge and basic abilities in Yoga, then it will benefit the practitioner.  The capstone is the 108 sun salutations in one set.  Nowhere else have I seen this large number of sun salutations as a goal of Yoga practice.  And while it is a challenging goal for advanced Yoga practitioners, is realistic for most individuals?  I am not sure.  And does that accomplishment really mean anything in the Yoga world?  But yes The Ultimate Yoga will enhance a practitioner's strength, stamina, balance and flexibility",1420416000,5,2349,4.693627450980392
5102192,5,B007OYK32K,"Enjoying these workouts and sticking with them each day!

I have had some issues with the DVD's as a few of them skip and act up, asked for a replacement on one its so bad can't view the end of the DVD, makes it hard to complete the days workout...

I have been a personal trainer (ACSM certified) and have my bachelors in Kinesiology and Health Promotion and this is one of the most comprehensive fitness program dvds I have stumbled across. The fitness world these days is bombarded with DO or DIE mentality of exercise. (I.e. if your not pushing yourself to exhaustion and about to pass out or throw up you are not exercising) this paradigm is not only dangerous but extremely ineffective for most people. I started this program as a means to bring more purposeful movement into my life, especially after years being entangled in the above mentioned paradigm, and its been amazing. Travis provides top notch instruction that meets the needs of any person from the first timer to the experience ""yogi"". I started the program with a basic foundation of yoga and I was able to jump in to the classes with little problems following along. BUT don't take that for the classes being easy.

I have done yoga for years and I have the highest praise for this production. The creator and instructor Travis Eliot is to be commended for putting this together and for his incredible charismatic presence that has served his vision so well here. His patience, empathy and thoroughness in helping you become ""The Ultimate Yogi"" is nothing short of miraculous. The production values are breathtaking. Shot in Bulgaria with excellent camera work and editing you get a first class Master's presentation of many facets of yoga all combined in a 12 DVD set to heal and sculpt your body as well as calm and center your mind. One pretty great feature on this is that you can play the DVD's with the music on, or you can turn it off and just have his voice instructing you....or.....you can turn their music off and do your yoga to anything you want to on your iPod while Travis instructs...this is really handy in doing a 108 Day program because you can make it fresh with whatever music floats your boat. Often I would just put my iPod on shuffle and flow into my yoga with Jimi Hendrix playing ""Pali Gap"", a little John Coltrane, Tim Story, Bill Douglas, Mozart, Dead can Dance, Clannad, Pierre Bensusan, whatever came up...doing yoga to the Stones playing ""Sweet Virginia"" off of ""Exile on Main Street"" was pretty damn great....so be creative, make the practice your own, but do this at least once in your life...you will ever know what you are capable of until you do..and you are so worth it.",1408838400,7,1634,4.5993150684931505

It's got that wonderful balance that is characteristic of a great yoga workout: it's calming yet leaves you charged with energy and a sense of wellness; it stretches and loosens, yet also strengthens and balances; it's ""no impact"" on the joints, yet can leaving you sweating and twitching in all your muscles.  It absolutely helps with increased strength, flexibility, cardio, vitality, and above all (in my book) core balance and fitness such that I'm getting my back and related issues in control so that I can be fit and healthy - a fine balance that's harder and harder to achieve as one ages.  It's beautiful to feel the accumulated stress and tension in my muscles and skeletal system warming up and releasing through the course of a workout, almost magically resolving what doctor, chiropractor, physical therapist, massage therapist, osteopath, and others could not - and at a tiny fraction of the cost.  Yes, Travis Eliot's drawn-out, nasal speech pattern and pronunciation can be a little annoying at times (can you say ""eh-kwaaaaaaaa-nimity""?), but he's also strangely calming, seems like a genuinely good person, and is an excellent instructor - heck, the idiosyncrasies are even endearing.

After one round of the Ultimate Yogi, I'm sure I'll be ready to return to p90x, running/lifting, etc., given the great progress that I've already made, just 3 weeks into the program, and I'm really looking forward to mixing it all up - possibly 3 days/week of yoga and 3 alternating with other stuff.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention what was possibly the most impressive of all: the company's customer service is unbelievably good!  When I got my order, I noticed that the calendar and eating guide were missing.  I emailed customer service, and a quick and polite series of emails ensued, deducing that I had unwittingly purchased a pirated version!  Since the company hadn't made 1 cent on my purchase, I hardly expected their help in getting the omitted items, yet after getting the info they needed to go after the pirate (I presume), they surprised me with a complimentary copy of the whole package (DVDs as well).  That goes way above and beyond expectations and makes me a huge fan - even beyond the delight that their excellent product won.

In short: superb, healthy workout program, backed by a company with a customer service standard that is off-the-charts good.",1408665600,21,2834,4.966173361522198

5102226,5,B007OYK32K,Hands down the best yoga program I have ever used in home. I suggest it to everyone.  Even my boyfriend with no yoga experience enjoys doing this program with me. Travis is great at making this accessible. He doesn't use too much yoga language but instead describes what you should be doing efficiently enough that you don't spend a lot of time looking at the tv. Great variety. Great workouts. It's like going on the best date ever when we do this because we have fun but are so relaxed at the end.,1408320000,,499,4.365591397849462
5102227,5,B007OYK32K,"This is a great program that I use daily; however, it is even more intensive than imagined.  It provides a calendar to tell you which of the 12 DVD's to do on each of the 108 days.  This is my first yoga DVD and am glad I purchased ""The Ultimate Yogi""as opposed to one of the quick 30 minute DVD's.  Eliot's  voice is great for a yoga instructor and is very motivational.

Recommendations:

1.  The only difficulty I have (as I am over 50) is ""jumping to the front or back of the mat.""  This extra time I need makes me rush to get to the next move.
2.  I wish a quick warm-up was included in the program, so I do a few minutes of Mountain Pose and general stretching prior to the DVD's.

I don't do the meditation, but use that as bible/prayer time instead.  Additionally, the diet he suggests would be ideal, but I have my own.

Most DVD's are over an hour, but the ""Hard Core"" (abs) is about 20 minutes in length.",1407974400,5,915,4.107344632768362

Coming from a background of only ever running and lifting weights, it was a game changer for me. As a man entering my mid-thirties, it's become more about being healthy and reducing stress. Travis' Yoga practices are a great way to make the transition into a more purposeful intent behind exercise, and presented that challenge I've always sought.

It's been almost 9 months since I've started yoga, so I've expanded to different instructors. That being said, I still use these and the short and sweet series regularly.

I lived in a larger city for a few years and I had an amazing yoga class the whole time. Loved my teacher so very much. But I changed jobs and came back to a small town where yoga is pretty much not heard of. I tried to just do it on my own for a while and it wasn't the same. Then after buying about 20 DVDs and hating them all I gave up. So I haven't really practiced in about 10 years now. This set was the answer to my prayers! If I didn't know any better I would think this teacher and my old teacher trained together. The first three discs and the hardcore are nearly identical to my old classes!

You also get a lesson in several types of meditation and yogic breathing.  Meditation is a part of the program starting with ten and moving up from there.  I remember days of wanting to throw my mat out the window but I kept coming back.  Travis is a great teacher.  He is funny, encouraging and kept me going.  I still was laughing at his 500 or so yogi push-ups jokes (or was it 5000 seemed like it) at the end.  Travis has some great downloads on his site.

You don't need yoga experience but it helps of course, but the alignment is so clear that if you pay attention you will not injure yourself.

The cool thing about it is, I didn't dread it like I did other programs i.e. P90X etc...All of the videos are challenging but not defeating per se.

5102241,5,B007OYK32K,"I loved this program! I have practiced yoga over the years, though not on a regular basis. So I was still, in a sense, a beginner. This program has gotten me to practice on a more regular schedule. It's a 108 day program, where you have 12 different DVDs each with a different class on them, such as ""Cross-Train,"" ""Cardio,"" ""Yin Yoga,"" ""Strength,"" ""Flexibility,"" etc. Each class is quite challenging in its own way. I have not finished all 108 days yet, but already I am feeling a difference in my strength & flexibility. I also feel better mentally, more relaxed rather than stressed. Part of this program involves meditation, and I think that helps.

Travis Eliot's instructions are excellent -- you always know what to do and what to do next. His cuing is clear and precise, and he gives very useful tips throughout on how to practice some of the poses. He mostly sticks with poses that are doable for beginners & intermediates -- nothing too advanced except maybe for Plow and Wheel poses, but he gives modifications (for example, he says you can stay in Bridge pose if you can't go into Wheel).

The DVDs come with a handy calendar that shows you the whole schedule for 108 days and a booklet explaining each part of the program.

I would recommend this for: beginners at yoga, though not total beginners (it helps to be familiar with the poses and terminology); intermediate yogis; yoga enthusiasts who would like a schedule to follow and specific classes to do.",1397606400,8,1469,4.664092664092664
5102242,5,B007OYK32K,"I absolutely love this series of workouts.  You won't regret making this investment because the return on your investment far surpasses what you pay for it.  Travis Eliot is an exceptionally good instructor - charming guy.  My wife says it's like having Jack Johnson as your yoga instructor (or the vibe of his music embodied into a person).  You can follow right along without having to look at the television.  He also gives you plenty of positive thoughts to meditate on during the workouts without coming across a ""granola"" or advocating for any Eastern philosophies or religions.  The workouts are strenuous but you feel terrific at the end of each one.  That's what I really love about the practice of yoga.  You never felt better after a workout in your life.  I feel better at 42 than I can ever remember feeling thanks to these workouts.  This program will definitely enrich your life.  You will feel better both physically and mentally.  If you've never practiced yoga before, you may want to check out the Foundations video by Travis or some other beginner program to gain some familiarity with the poses but it's definitely not required.  Lots of what I've encountered in these videos I had never done before but I've found it fun and easy (at least conceptually) to learn.  I used to throw in a yoga workout once every other week of so into my workout routine for a change of pace but this program has me committed to making yoga a part of my life for the remainder of my life.",1397433600,7,1490,4.61596958174905
5102243,5,B007OYK32K,"I have purchased a lot of fitness dvds since college and I learned that I should just stop buying them and just repeat the few I actually like (for example anything by Ellen Barrett!). However, I saw this and figured I would love a ""P90X"" type workout routine but I can't stand all the jumping around and lifting weights. I do love going to yoga studios so I thought this would be fun. I'm coming up on my 30th birthday right around the end of this 108 day yoga challenge so I'm excited to see the results. I'm not 100% doing the eating part because I'm working full time and have an 8 month old daughter so my husband and I kind of just trade off making meals. But whats funny about yoga vs running or P90x for example is that the energy you get from working out is different. After running I could eat anything but after yoga I never feel like eating something heavy or greasy. Odd, I'm not sure why but that's how I feel.
I'm 5 days in only but every workout I've loved and could say that it is at par with any great yoga studio class if not this is better. My only problem with this is that the guy doing it is kind of cheesy. I get the business student vibe more than the yogi he's trying hard to portray but I don't mind so much now that I've done the classes. CrossTrain really was an amazing workout and after Strength I was very sore!

I have been doing various types of yoga on and off for about 6 years- i bought this to develop my home practice since i had become dependent on the bikram classes, but my schedule wasn't willing to cooperate with theirs. I would say these are more geared for people already somewhat familiar with yoga. Fast paced, i found these vigorous and challenging. Most of the videos were longer than i had expected (about an hour) but still do-able.
I love the music in these videos. I could do with a little less talking and little less word exaggeration from Travis. Downward Doooooooooooooggggggggggg. Every single time. His narration can also come off a bit pretentious at times, and can seem a bit fake.

5102253,5,B007OYK32K,"I bought this DVD set after seriously injuring my neck (C-6/C7) and my back in a bad fall. I used this program to successfully rehabilitate my neck and back, in conjunction with regular chiropractic visits. I highly recommend this Yoga set because it is a varied and intense program that I really enjoyed and which aided me immensely in my recovery. Since I couldn't do my traditional forms of exercise I turned to yoga, giving me a great workout and stretching and working my spine to keep me supple and flexible while healing. This program also taught me breathing techniques that really help to calm me down which is very helpful to me since I am an Iraq war veteran and I have some anger issues.

I expect to be able to get back into high intensity programs like p90x2 and Insanity the Asylum very shortly, which I consider to be a sign of success in rehabbing my neck and a testimony to the effectiveness of yoga for injury treatment. As for this program specifically, the yoga is quite excellent and challenging. Travis is an effective instructor who offers a wide variety of yoga poses and tips on how to achieve them. He introduced me to some poses I was unfamiliar with and kept the hippy sayings and stories to what I consider to be an acceptable minimum. I actually enjoyed some of the stuff he had to say unlike some other yoga programs where I felt like I was in a free love commune being bombarded by new age platitudes. As a former soldier, that type of thing is not exactly my cup of tea.

Overall, this collection has definitely earned a place in my workout rotation. I've learned the hard way that once you leave your 20's injuries occur more easily and take a lot more time to heal. I've decided that exercises that increase my flexibility, which aids in injury prevention, need to be part of my weekly routine. With 11 good yoga dvds plus an ab dvd to pick from I can easily integrate more yoga into my weekly schedule and help prevent injuries. I've been through P90x, P90x2, all the Insanity programs, and I've learned that they all incorporate yoga poses, stretches, and workouts into each program. If it's good enough for Tony Horton and Shaun T, it's good enough for me.

5102262,5,B007OYK32K,"Just a little bit on my background, so that you know where I am coming from.  I have been working out regularly for 20 years, and I am 35. I first started practicing yoga a year and a half ago.  I would say that my fitness level is advanced, and that my yoga competency level is somewhere between intermediate and advanced.
  I am still in the first cycle of this program.  I will edit this review as I progress.
  If you are someone who is new to exercise, THIS PROGRAM IS NOT YET FOR YOU.  I would recommend a more beginner's workout like Travis Elliot's Yoga Foundations, first.  I say this because I have seen people poorly review this product as not being for beginners.  That makes no sense to me.  It's called ""The ULTIMATE Yogi,"" not ""The Novice Yogi.""  He doesn't focus on proper alignment a lot, because it is assumed that you already know it. Additionally, people who don't normally exercise at all might not be able to do a lot of several of the discs.
  Another thing I've have seen other reviewers comment on is Travis's accent.  He does have an accent that is specific to a certain part of California, I believe.  I have never had any difficulty understanding him.  In fact, I find his cueing to be excellent.  I generally don't need to look at the screen to know what I am supposed to be doing (another reason why it's good to know some poses and proper alignment before starting this program).  That said, I don't even notice his accent anymore.

  The program is a definite commitment of time.  However, if you currently exercise, you may already be committing this time.  There is a set schedule of seven different workouts every week, that changes to a new schedule every 36 days.  There is also an 18 minute hardcore workout to be done three times a week.  In addition to this, the program recommends 10 minutes of meditation daily, that increases to 20 minutes daily during the 2nd 36 days, and 30 minutes of daily meditation the last 36 days.  Basically, you are looking at a bare minimum commitment on Mountain Pose day of 40 minutes, up to a maximum on detox day of the last 36 days of 117 minutes.
  So far, I can say that every minute has been worth it.  The music is excellent.  I have found each workout to be challenging, but doable; and I feel so fresh and fulfilled afterwards.  Many may not be able to complete the sessions in the entirety for the first few week, but they will improve if they stick to it.  The meditation, which I didn't think I would get into, has been great!  I feel so happy after just ten minutes every day.  There is a FB group in which people currently completing the program can discuss their journey, and find support from others.
  Bottom line is that, mentally/emotionally, this is the happiest I have been in a long time.  Physically, even after  working out for many years, I am getting stronger and more flexible in my body and in life.  I am expecting to see changes in my body.

5102264,5,B007OYK32K,"If you're looking to explore yoga in a way that provides quick noticeable benefits, this is for you. But I can see how this isn't for everyone - particularly those with very limited mobility, or those who are very advanced in their yoga practice.

I've been a health-conscious and active person for several years now, but the Ultimate Yogi really changed my approach to taking care of myself. After years of running marathons and targeted weight training at the gym, my body was starting to feel a little beat up. And I'm only 29. I thought I was stretching well before my runs, and targeting the right muscles in the gym, but the Ultimate Yogi allowed me to explore new depths I didn't know existed in myself.

The first month or so I felt I was being ironed out. There was a lot of imbalance in my flexibility and strength. For instance, my left lower body was a lot tighter than my right, which in hindsight explains my recurring injuries on my right side from running. Gradually I began to gain strength throughout my body, particularly in places I was finding it difficult to target in the gym.

If you stick to the diet (which wasn't really much of a change from my previous diet), and you follow the instructions of the program, you will see the results. A happy body really contributes to a happy mind. This is something I've always known, but there is a well-rounded approach to this series that allows you to explore and find balance in your life both physically and mentally.

On a side note - the customer service of Udaya was excellent. One of my DVDs was skipping, so I contacted customer service. Without hesitation a replacement DVD was sent within a few days.",1389052800,9,1676,4.558139534883721

I can safely say it's the best $100 I have ever spent. I have given this set to friends and family and it changes everyone it comes in contact with for the better. We have since tried countless other DVDs and nothing can compare to the excellent structure in which Travis conducts his classes. The first couple weeks were killer for semi-out-of-shape beginners, like us, but if you stick with it, after a month or so it will become second-nature and you will not be able to fathom not having a daily yoga routine in your life. I had borderline gluttonous eating and drinking habits until this DVD set came into my life over a year ago and I haven't looked back since! BUY IT!!!!",1386028800,24,864,4.440251572327044
5102272,5,B007OYK32K,"Lots of reviews have detailed reports on each of the varying discs and workouts, so I wanted to do an overall general results review.

Goals: I wanted to lose weight and tone up. I'm short and before I did Ulitmate Yogi program my workout focus was on Barre workouts. I was muscular but looked stocky because of my height. I combined the Ultimate Yogi program with extreme cardio HIIT training.

Phase 1: For three months before this program, I did Kundalini Yoga series, so I had yoga experience but the pace of these DVDs are so different it takes getting used to. They are faster and the moves are a mixture of strength and flexibility. Travis does a great job of creating sequences so it does flow well together but after Day 1 of  CrossTrain I wanted to kill him and I questioned buying the DVD. I'm glad I stuck with it. By the end of week 2 on Phase 1, I was quicker, faster, and stronger. By the end of Phase 1, I moved through the Sun Saluation 36 dvd with confidence. My body was still muscular but I noticed I was trimming up. I did not lose weight, but I could tell that my body was slowly changing.

Phase 2: During the beginning of Phase 2, you have a new set of DVD rotation, so the mix-up was nice. By week 3, my flexibility had increased. My body was coke body, trimmed, and lean. My muscles no longer looked stocky, but had leaned out, I hadn't lost but instead gained weight. However, I looked smaller than I had from being my smallest weight. In other words, my muscle was growing and leaning out making me look amazing.

Outcome: Toned muscular lean legs, round raised booty (I had issue with the shape of my booty after the Barre workouts), strong muscular calves, toned arms, and con-caved waist. Amazing! All of those warrior poses are great lunges and the cobra poses and yoga style pushups were great for upper body.

Spiritual: Travis is a warm, light spirit, at first I did my own mediation time. He has a smoothing voice and offers great advice throughout the dvds.",1385769600,32,1994,4.419618528610354

I have had previous yoga experience(only with dvds), and was already familiar with most of the poses.  This series is challenging and motivating.  I really like how my body feels after every workout.  Travis is very easy to follow and I really like how he even lets you know when to breathe.  Some of these workouts are fast moving and quite intense.  It would be difficult to follow along, coordinate the movements and breath if he wasn't such a perfect guide.  I highly recommend this to anyone, experienced or new.  If you are new to yoga, do some research and learn some poses and maybe watch each dvd first before attempting it.  If you get discouraged, keep trying! Yoga is about learning and personally discovering your own strengths.  Never compare yourself to the people in the video, most of them have very thin, fit, and flexible bodies.  Enjoy your own journey!",1384732800,10,1023,4.622222222222222

If you are a complete peace loving hippie you might enjoy what he has to say, but for everyone else its just BS. Yoga is suppose to be peaceful, but listening to all of his nonsense makes me angry. He is constantly babbling metaphors and philosophies on how you should life you're life. All i wanted out of this was some good yoga workouts, not the CONSTANT rambling. He using phases throughout the entire workout like,"" move with compassion.....go all the way down to mother earth....feel the awareness in your legs"". And its not so much that what he is saying is wrong, its how he says it. His tone couldn't be more frustrating and annoying to have to listen to for an hour nonstop.

5102277,5,B007OYK32K,"This is a challenging yoga fitness program that requires at least a 108-day commitment. Being a senior citizen and new to yoga, I'm glad I started with Travis' ""Yoga Foundations"" DVD, before attempting this one. Even so, I have to modify some of the poses and find I'm too slow to get all parts of the vinyasa in between some of the flowing poses. I also take a couple days per week away from the difficult practices in the UY program to do easier yoga or go to a local class. While I have been active and relatively fit my whole life, ""The Ultimate Yogi"" is bringing me to a higher level of fitness as a 67-year-old. This is also my first exposure to the practice of meditation, key to mind fitness.
I love Travis' style. He leads with a sense of humor. He encourages, while cautioning. His cueing is spot-on and speaks to me. I like having the class to practice with right in my own home.

This workout program has a similar structure to p90x, but for me is much nicer. Doing yoga everyday seems more like a reward than a chore. I would recommend this to anyone looking to do yoga at home, or just feel better about themselves in all aspects of life and physical fitness.",1381363200,2,386,4.22972972972973
5102279,3,B007OYK32K,"I was seeking a workout that was not so harsh on the body as I am starting to develop nerve problems as well as knee and other myrid of what comes with carrying around extra weight and getting older. I discovered this workout by accident and thought. ""Okay I really can't afford for this to not work and they do give you a money back guarntee"" So I went and plopped down the money for this program.

This program is not very well organized and you'll have to do some researching on the website as that is what they keep referring to. They give you a chart with what days to do the program, the dvd's are numbered, the program itself is a space saver as it comes in a little disc size box. But I had to ask for the workout times on the facebook page they have as I was not able to find out anywhere.

The meditation part is confusing. Travis wants you to meditate but doesn't explain that the Meditation on the chart (they supply you with, which I might add is great if you have the wall space) is found on Disc 11 under the Pranayama Meditation and there's no menu selection for the Meditation you have to basicly skip until you find the chapter in which he verbally introduces it. I found that tidbit on the Website and having to go on the disc to see what chapter to skip it to. I've always assumed Meditation is sitting and breathing and just quiet thoughts with your mind. Travis's meditation is him talking the whole time. Now I don't mind the wisdom he's trying to impart but I guess we have a different view on what meditation is. It's nice if you need to focus on something though. The food plan is misleading. Once again I guess I have different assumptions as to what a ""food plan"" is compared to this one.

The Yoga workout itself is challenging and if your not familiar with the poses you will become frustrated and feel very humbled in the beginning. You will sweat in most of the programs and your muscles will ache. My back hurt when I would get up in the morning the first week but I know that is because my stomach muscles are weak. I have to admit to having to stop and get into child's pose and cry becuase I had so much muscle tension in my body that I had to take a small break in a couple of the workouts and saying to myself I bought this program...why? .But If you stick with the Yoga workouts it will be worth it.

The things I loved about this workout was the music and the way Travis paced you. His voice tone was even and he gentle moved you along and varied the different cues and not saying the same thing over and over. His voice is okay there are some women who love it but I'm eh about it. Also there are a variety of people in the workout and vary degrees in which they were doing the poses, some of them even lost their balance and had to modify the poses. In other words more realistic.

But all in all I think I got my monies worth.",1381104000,44,2869,4.152877697841727

5102283,3,B007OYK32K,"I'd just like to preface by stating that 3 stars, in my book, is still a solid rating.  Four stars is reserved for far above average, and five stars goes to life-changing.  The Ultimate Yogi is solid; it's a fantastic foundation for a home-based practice, and is extremely and impressively well-rounded.  Perhaps it is life-changing for the relatively new to yoga, but for the experienced yogi, this program will feel fulfilling but not necessarily groundbreaking.

I am very glad to have purchased this product, as I now have a great selection of go-to classes for my home practice.  I will definitely continue to revisit Eliot's classes as needed; it's great to know that I can just pop the Yin DVD into my computer and bliss out in the comfort of my own apartment instead of paying $15 for a studio class.

That said, I would have enjoyed a little more of a challenge in some of the classes.  That's not to say that these classes are not challenging--on the contrary, the Cardio class had me sweating bullets with my heart in my throat; and every time Travis sets the stage for those d*%$ ""yogi-style push-ups,"" I want to curse him out (as much as I truly do love and appreciate him).  However, I was a bit disappointed there wasn't a little more--I would have really enjoyed getting into some serious arm balances, inversions, and more daring balancing poses now and then.  Sometimes, I just felt like the practice was a little ""vanilla"" (i.e. in Cross-Train); I wanted something more to light the fire and really get me to that point of feeling totally empowered and euphoric.  Perhaps, given the fact that I have been practicing yoga for over a decade, I am a little more of a junkie in that regard.

All in all, it's a solid practice and will definitely help you on your journey to becoming a supple leopard (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-a-Supple-Leopard-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Resolving-Pain-Preventing-Injury-and-Optimizing-Athletic-Performance/dp/1936608588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming a Supple Leopard: The Ultimate Guide to Resolving Pain, Preventing Injury, and Optimizing Athletic Performance</a>) and upregulating that gamma-Amintobutyric acid.",1376956800,16,2226,5.423188405797101

I have had an on/off affair with yoga over the years as I took up other sports. It was never the priority of my routine. Running, biking, kick boxing and weight lifting (as a semi pro) was always at the top of my list and yoga came later if at all. While I still bike, run and lift weights about 5 years ago I became very serious about my yoga due to arthritis and stiff joints. Now Yoga takes priority over all. I have many DVD's Baptist, Kest, Swenson,Yee and had private instruction. I love them all but I really love this series. The series is a challenge and has varied routines that will get you moving. Travis is precise without being overly talkative and while he is serious there is a sense of lightness in his teaching that I like. If you cannot be lighthearted in your exercise routines you are doing them for all the wrong reasons. I feel invigorated and complete when I am done (I love the cardio flow and flexability routines). At no time do I feel in danger of hurting myself as Travis always takes the time to warm you up before the routine.

After working through the Cross Training, Cardio, Strength, Flexibility and Detox videos I've suffered from throbbing headaches and neck pain which is a red flag that the workouts are strenuous.  I enjoy the workouts in this series due to opportunity to get a good fitness workout but I think the workouts are extreme, especially when instructed to repeat the same flow up to 4 or 5 times and often too quickly (esp. the Cardio workout).
Referring to P90X and yoga together is an oxymoron, such a contradiction.  The fact that this is being referred to as the P90X of yoga really makes me question what yoga has become in this country.  I do enjoy the difficulty of the power yoga workouts but I feel it's missing the mark of what yoga is supposed to be.
I am in very good physical condition but the thought of doing these workouts everyday is absurd.  The workouts are long, most are an hour.  The workouts push your body to its limits.  I personally need at least a day between these workouts for my body to repair and heal.  This may be because I am in my early 40's.  The average person who does regular yoga is likely not going to be able to buy this series and jump right into these workouts as prescribed.
I like Eliot's instruction.  He is clear and it's easy to do the moves without looking at the screen.  He provides some instruction for proper executive for someone who is very familiar with yoga.

The focus is mostly on being ""ultimate"" instead of being authentic. I bought this to gain some variety. It does offer that. However the sacrifice is not worth the price. Proof is alive in the online group... injured members struggle to keep up with the timeline. Modifying is not encouraged.

I would give this product a 5 stars but would like to say that meditation part in every workout which in the calender says 10 minutes for the first 36 days, 20 minutes for 72 days and 30 minutes for 108 days was a bit confusing.

5102307,5,B007OYK32K,"What brings this 50+ (yikes) year-old-guy to yoga is a bad back and a sports injury from my twenties that still flares up when it rains.
I have a selection of perhaps a dozen yoga dvds, with some hits and some misses. P90X (hit, but too long) HD Yoga (hit, a softer yoga), Yoga Meltdown (total miss, no 'tush' talk, thank you), Shiva Rea (total miss due to all the drum dancers and dollar store Hindu statues, though I love the Agni flow, where you end up doing 108 push ups, now THAT got my attention) and Sadie Nardini (hit, some of her routines are tough!), Yoga Download (some hits and some misses, but I like variety). This should give you an idea of ""where I am coming from"" for my morning yoga.

I came across Ultimate Yogi by chance, and decided to take the plunge. I wondered if I was tossing money away, as most of my yoga dvd purchases have been in the 10 to 20 buck range, putting out 100 bucks plus for yoga dvds I had not viewed was a 'stretch' for me.

I was not disappointed, in the least.

As others here have noted, there is a corny mini-movie at the beginning of the series. Skip that and move on. I had never heard of Travis before. He speaks a dialect of English, Californian-Yoga-Creole, but it isn't over-the-top, actually I think it is OK.
His cueing is really excellent, and his 'patter' during the flow is both soothing and encouraging for those of us that need to modify the transitions more than most. Think Tony Horton, after he had spent a year on a beach in Goa, and you wouldn't be too far off.

Other reviewers have given a breakdown of the dvds, and some have done us all a service by posting the run times of the different dvds, they all clock in at an hour+. Perhaps my only ""fault"" that I could find with this program, is that it would have been nice if there had been a dvd with shorter routines included. Travis also has a dvd 'Short and Sweet' that has four thirty-minute routines on. That would have been nice to include in this set, or rotation, of workouts as there are those mornings when I really don't have 70 minutes to devote to yoga. I will most likely buy (and review) that dvd in the near future.

The dvds are also ""guy-friendly"", in that you can wach them and not be embarrassed if your friends come over. No creepy yoga dude (Kest), no drum dancers prepping for the Burning Man (Rea), no ""tush-talk"" (Michaels), just straight up yoga flows.

Unlike most yoga ""workout"" dvds out there, there are explicit meditations with this 'rotation'. My initial reaction to these were ""whatever yoga-guy"". I have actually come to appreciate them more than I thought I would. To be honest, I seldom do them, as with the pace of life/work/kids I find it near impossible to fit in. The meditations are not sectarian in any way, shape, or form (and I TRULY dislike dvds that wrap themselves up in a sort of fake-plastic-pseudo-Hindu thingey to make themselves more exotic, sorry Rea). I am agnostic myself, I guess, and believe the meditations here could not offend anyone's God (in what any form he / she or it may take). There is nothing sectarian in expression of gratitude, for example. If the expression of gratitude does offend your God, I advise you to seek out a different God.

The production value of these dvds are excellent! Spot on! The music is very good, not too intrusive but encouraging. What is unique to these yoga dvds as well, is that the music, at points at least, seems actually scored to what is transpiring in the workout, it isn't just a random backtrack like in all my other dvds. I can state for sure best soundtrack to a yoga dvd. Whoever worked out the music and scored this, good job done!

OK, so near perfect product.

Customer Service.

When I got these dvds I found that the first one, Crosstrain had a scratch. To be honest, I am unsure if it was like that in the case, or if, bleary-eyed at 5:30 a.m., I messed it up. I am pretty spastic at that hour. At any rate I was a bit choked that I now had a defective dvd in my expesnive yoga dvd set, and I hadn't done a full week yet. I contacted this company to see if I could get buy a replacement of just one disc, not the whole set. They immediately sent me a replacement dvd!!! Talk about excellent Customer Service!

I do not regret this purchase in any way. Solid product backed by excellent customer service.

5102315,5,B007OYK32K,"I heard of this set when it first came out, but held off on purchasing it since I wasn't sure that I would actually follow through with doing the program.  While I love working out and have a small collection of yoga DVDs, I somehow have always put off doing yoga on a regular basis.  Flash-forward to three months ago, when a fitness forum I frequent had a thread going about the best workout DVDs people had purchased in 2012 -- and the Ultimate Yogi set was on that list again and again.  Several people in that thread said that this is the set that makes you actually do yoga - and I completely agree!

Because of some hectic times at work, my husband (who is doing this with me) and I got off to a slow start with this, and it took us about about a month to get the first week under our belts.  After that, though, we were able to get into the ""flow"" of the program, and have been doing it a few nights a week.  We aren't planning on doing it every day as the program encourages people to, but, even so, have already been seeing tremendous benefits.

My husband is doing this as his main form of exercise, and so far he has started to lose some weight and tone up.  I'm doing it to help with stress and sleep, and it's been amazing for that! The first night we did the Yin practice, I got nine hours of sleep, which is unheard of for me.  The nights that we do the practices, we both sleep better and feel less stressed.

Another excellent feature is that Travis has excellent cueing!  There is no need to keep moving your head to look at the screen since he guides you into each pose so easily. His voice is really relaxing, and he has a nice playful tone in places.  (For instance, he calls out ""Down doooooooog!"" as he gets you to move into that pose in a very fun way.)

Each practice is also very well-sequenced, and each pose moves seamlessly into the next.

Here is a breakdown of the length of each DVD that I found on a different website (with my comments added to each one):

* Hardcore 18 minutes (core/ab workout, meant to be done three times a week; this one just has Travis in it)
* Cross Train 65 minutes
* Cardio 63 minutes
* Strength 65 minutes
* Flexibility 72 minutes
* Balance 61 minutes
* Detox 72 minutes
* Vitality 69 minutes
* Yin Yoga 65 minutes
* Gentle Yoga 56 minutes
* Mountain Pose 28 minutes
* Pranayama Meditation video -- 10-, 20-, and 30-minute meditations; you are supposed to start with 10 minutes of daily meditation, and then add ten-minute increments as you work your way through the 108 days
* Sun Salutations -- there are three practices on this DVD, and each one is meant to be done at various points in the program -- the 36 days practice is 17 minutes, 72 days is 32 minutes, 108 days is 47 minutes

On a different note, the Ultimate Yogi people have great customer service.  I had emailed them with a question early on in the program, and they got back to me right away and were very helpful.

Someone in a previous review mentioned that this UY set is too spiritual, but I don't think so at all.  Travis certainly doesn't try to proselytize, and the set seems very secular to me.

If you're new to yoga or it's been awhile since you've practiced, you might want to start with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Foundations-With-Travis-Eliot/dp/B0087XNTAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Foundations With Travis Eliot</a>.  That disk comes with three practices, and you can start with Level 1 and do it for a few weeks, before you move on to the second and third levels.

I'm so happy I bought this set! If, like me, you're looking for a program that will get you to do yoga on a more regular basis, this might be just what you're looking for.

5102317,5,B007OYK32K,"My story:
This review is just as much as a 'thank you' to Travis Eliot as it is a testimate to how amazing this yoga series has been for me. First, I must tell you a bit about who I am and how this DVD came into my practice. I am not a hard core yogi. Though my wife is an instructor, I am a complete novice when it comes to the yoga practice having only started yoga in the last two years as a compliment to my true passion which is martial arts (Kung Fu) and endurance sports (running). As a man in my mid 40's, my stretchy parts are far from that and I always struggled with yoga as a result. Though I would include yoga now and then to try and extend my martial art prowess, I often found other DVD's and local classes to be either too technically difficult, or the reverse; not physically challenging enough. As a runner, my hamstrings are short, tight and I knew that yoga was a necessity to helping me with Kung Fu, but still hadn't found a program that was a good balance between the internal and external focus I was looking for.

Then my journey began. But not with yoga or these DVD's: with my quest to run a marathon. I began training in August of 2012 and things were going fine until my first 14 mile run. I had severe pain in my left knee as tendenitis made it almost impossible to walk the last 100 yards to the car. I powered through the next several weeks until the 18 mile run came. Then my RIGHT knee went bad and I thought that I couldn't make it. Then a 21 mile run and my joints were falling apart. I was considering giving up the marathon goal.

Enter my wife with her Travis Eliot DVD's. She started the 108 day program and I joined her for nearly each sequence. Though I didn't do it every day (as she did) since I was still training for the marathon, I did however make sure that one particular sequence, Yin, was completed each night before a long run, and the evening after the run, as well as the hardcore for my martial arts, and the strength sequence for both running and Kung Fu. That is when everything changed.

My knee pain began to go away. My minutes per mile began to drop and I would feel both relaxed and refreshed after a long run. Sure, a lot of this was my running training, but I can tell you with 100% conviction that Travis Eliot had a LOT to do with it as well. How do I know? Because as my running improved, with knee pain fading away, my martial arts improved. I saw amazing changes in how far I could stretch. I gained several INCHES in how deep I could go after a few months doing this series with my wife. Then the big day came, yesterday, February 17th, 2013, when I stepped up to the starting line of the Austin Livestrong Marathon.

I just wanted to finish the run. I just wanted to make it without knee and joint problems or pain. I planned on finishing in 5.5 hours. Well, I didn't finish in 5.5: I finished in 5hrs 5mins. My first marathon and I did it in 25 minutes less than I thought I could. Sure, not a record breaking performance, but for me, it was a big deal. And through the whole run, not a single complaint from my knees, feet or hips. I am absolutely convinced it is because of the yoga practice (especially Yin) that made ALL the difference in the world. Today, after the run, I feel great and tonight I'll be doing Yin again to help with my speedy recovery. Next year, I'm going to break a sub-five marathon. I know I will because I will do the ENTIRE 108 days as part of my training.

So though I doubt Travis will ever read this, thank you none the less. You helped me achieve a life long goal. Thank you. Namaste.",1361145600,35,3589,4.150862068965517

5102324,5,B007OYK32K,"I rarely write reviews, but I had to rate this product because it has impacted my life tremendously.  I have done yoga before.  I've actually done it on and off for several years.  I've done local classes as well as DVD workouts.  And every time I would eventually lose interest and move on to something else.  I've also done almost every Beachbody workout out there.  I do like to push myself.  When I got this program I was in the middle of my second round of P90X.  Since getting this program it is the only workout I've been doing and I don't feel like I'm missing anything.  If I wanted to add a little cardio or strength I would, but I honestly don't feel the need and this workout does take a significant time committment if you are doing the Hardcore and Meditations as suggested.

I love everything about the program.  Its not easy.  And there are times when I wonder (for example, in the middle of workouts like Strength and Detox) why did I choose this again??  But afterwards I feel great and it lasts the rest of the day.  I get so much out of this program.  So much more than just the yoga.  I feel calmer, stronger, more flexible, happier.  I have had surgery for torn cartilege in my hip and I have a pretty significant issue with my lower back.  I have to modify some of the poses but honestly this program has helped so much.  I haven't taken any pain medication since starting the prgram. I just can't say enough good things about it.  I get up each day looking forward to doing yoga that day.  That has never happened for me before at a sustained intensity.

I think Travis Eliot is an excellent instructor.  The things that he says in this program stick with me and I find myself thinking about them later.  Yes, he talks through much of it.  I actually love that.  I rarely even look at the television because his verbal instructions are so thorough.  I've read questions about his accent.  Yes, he has an inflection but to be honest, I don't even notice it anymore.  The content of what he is saying is so much more powerful than a little bit of an accent or inflection.

I'm currently on Day 21 (in a row!) but will pop back in later as I get further in the program and update my thoughts on it.  For now, I can say that I cannot recommend this program highly enough.  I absolutely love it.",1356048000,26,2314,4.309302325581395
5102325,5,B007OYK32K,"I have been practicing yoga for at least ten years.  I have never taken a live class and learned yoga from books and DVDs.  Over the past few years I have moved away from Hatha yoga in favor of Ana & Ravi's Kundalini yoga dvds.  I wanted to start a work out program to help keep muscle mass that is often lost due to aging while working on the loss in mobility in my joints due to a hereditary condition. I also had gotten away from my personal meditation practice while I was doing the Ana & Ravi's workouts since they have meditation built in along with some pranayama but I wanted a longer practice with less focus on Sikh mantras.

Just when I was about to make my hair fall out trying to figure out how to do all of these things while still work for a living in walked (or downward dogged) Travis Eliot into my life with a P90X style Yoga program.  I could not purchase the program fast enough once I found it.  As soon as I got the dvd's, I downloaded them to my computer and then to my ipod and started my first of the 108 days that evening.  I have now finished my first 36 days and I have started the second cycle of 36 days so I have now done all of the dvds. Travis Eliot is an excellent teacher and seems like an all round great guy.  His cueing is so good I was able to do all the dvd's by ipod alone and only once or twice did I have to stop what I was doing and pull the ipod out of my armband and look at the video.

Travis teaches mainly in Santa Monica and he reminds me of my previously favorite Santa Monica yogi, Bryan Kest.  Travis calls his yoga classes in rhymes like Kest in a sing-song voice which is what I think people are picking up on when they mention in reviews about his voice.  This speech pattern seems to me a Santa Monica or California thing and you get used to it fast.  Also like Kest, Travis TALKS A LOT during his class and if I was going to deduct any points it would be for the fact that they do not have the option to play the class with music and cues only like they on P90X.  After having done the majority of the dvds over 5 times some of the chatter is starting to get a little old and I think if they do a second edition or an Ultimate Yogi 2 that they should drop the option to do the workout without music and instead add option to do it with music and cueing because that would add a lot to repeatability of the program.  However, I not take a point off because the program earned points in so many other areas that to do so just seemed petty.

In closing, if you like Hatha yoga and enjoy the California style Power Yoga classes you will LOVE this series.  Although I personally prefer my yoga with all the religion intact, I do enjoy Travis' Unitarian approach and agree with other reviewers that there is NOTHING in these classes that anyone from any religious (or non-religion) background would find offensive. Travis is a little more spiritual or introspective than Bob Harper or Tony Horton but his primary focus is on being in the moment, staying in tune with your body and living life with gratitude which are things I thing 95% of people should not find hokey.

Sidebar on each DVD:

CROSS TRAINING - easiest of the non yin classes and one of my favorites in the program

CARDIO - second hardest with the highest dread factor being the cycle of 10

STRENGTH - third hardest with LOTS of arm balances but not as hard on wrists as I feared

FLEXIBILITY - a beast but in a good way - has moves I have never done which makes me love this class but I know it will have a pretty high dread factor for the non gumby types

BALANCE - Travis states in the dvd that he bets we never want to put this dvd back in the player again after doing the class once and he is right - Hardest of all classes but where would be the challenge if there was not at least one dvd that might actually take 15 times to actually be able to do it without stumbling a few times;

DETOX - lots of twists which I thought I would not like but it is actually my second favorite and like cross training is one of the lighter days while still being yang

VITALITY - my favorite class which surprised me since I am not really big into backbends

HARDCORE - doable but with plenty of with room to grow and not nearly as high a dread factor as I feared and enough variety that I have not gotten bored with it even after doing it over 15 times

GENTLE YOGA - I have only done this once in the program so far and did not like it as much as I hoped but it will probably grow on me

YIN YOGA - would have been my favorite if Travis did not talk so much - this is another that will be real hard for non flexible people especially since you hold a couple of the poses for over 5 minutes

MOUNTAIN POSE SERIES - closest thing to a misstep to me first time I did it but after the 6th time it is starting to grow on me but do I wish it was little more Qi Gong and in fact I have on occasion substituted a Qi Gong dvd for this one

PRANAYAMA MEDITATION - wish he would count a little quieter because it takes me out of the meditation but other than that I am happy with this one.",1354838400,54,5090,4.03681592039801

I've tried about every yoga instructor (on DVD) out there, but Travis Eliot is my personal favorite.  He gives you a physically challenging, demanding workout, but he also gives insight to proper form, breathing, and ways to get the most out of the poses and flows.  Speaking of flows, he incorporates several flow sequences into almost every workout and my body responds well to the continusl movement.  In addition, he talks during the classes and gives various ways to practically apply yoga to your life.  I'm a devout Christian woman and don't subscribe to many of the spiritual philosophies typically associated with yoga, but I am comfortable with Travis's instruction.  I find his instruction style, the inflections in his voice, and the fluidity of his classes physically demanding yet calming and focused.

Again, I just cannot do justice to this program - I highly recommend it!!",1353715200,13,1262,5.0
5102328,5,B007OYK32K,"It is a wonderful program.  Travis Eliot is a great instructor. I wish I can take one of his classes in person, but this is the next best thing,",1352937600,,144,3.9655172413793105
5102329,5,B007OYK32K,"Is this a magic bullet?  No.  Will you become thin and beautiful?  Maybe not, but you will feel wonderful inside.  This 108 day program has truly changed my life.

I am an advanced and fit exerciser who has does heavy strength training and intense cardio.  Because of a torn hip cartilage, I had to really modify my workouts.  I was looking for something that would help me maintain my fitness level and the Ultimate Yogi seemed to be just the thing.  Prior to this,  I did yoga 1 to 2 days a week.  I followed the 108 day program, while also incorporating some moderate weight training and cardio.  I also followed the Common Sense Eating program.

I was a little nervous staring this program since I was concerned that my wrists would bother me when I did so much yoga.  Well, after 108 days I'm happy to say I didn't have any issues.  I think it's because each yoga routine is so different that you don't overdo any one pose.

My results:

**I now weigh what I did in high school, for the first time since high school.  And that was a long time ago!

**I am so much calmer than I used to be.  I am usually a hyper person who can't sit still and who is very impatient.  Not anymore.  When you wake up totally refreshed from a good night's sleep, or having a deep massage is the closest I can describe how I now feel.

**My arms are toned like never before! There are more toned than when I was doing heavy weights.  All the body weight work in yoga really works!  Every one's body is unique and will react differently to various types of training.  Well, all the body weight work in yoga is what finally (!) gave me toned arms.  I can actually see my shoulder and triceps muscles now.

Why I so love this program:

**The yoga flows.  I respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers who thought this program was too repetitive.  I felt that each routine was different so that I didn't get bored.  I especially loved how Travis structures the flows so that you do the poses slowly and then put them together into a nice flow.

**The timing of the postures.  Sure there are some tough poses, can we say ""twisting half moon?""  You hold them long enough to be challenged but not so long that you are dying and wondering when you can stop.

**Travis' excellent verbal cuing.  I knew exactly what to do by listening to him and I didn't have to look up at the screen to see what to do.  Note:  If you are beginner yogi, this may not be possible for you since you may not be familiar with all the poses.

**Lessening my view of ""all or nothing.""  I didn't follow the Eating Program exactly, especially when it came to the cleanses.  Call it life (and family) getting in the way.  I still got lots of benefit from this program.  Travis also gently reminds us that yoga is about the journey and not the end result.  So I don't look anything like the class when I'm doing some of the poses.  This doesn't matter because the poses are working for me.

**The yogi-style pushups.  Okay, I'll admit it, normally I don't like pushups but I know they do great things for my upper body and my core.  I love how Travis `sneaks' in 5 - 10 of these pushups in almost every workout.  You do enough so that you can get stronger, but not so many that you give up in frustration.

**The suitability for all levels.  Intermediate yogis can do this program; people with injuries can do this program.  Advanced yogis can do this program.  It's very versatile.  Travis mentions many modifications, including both easier and harder versions of the poses.

**The suitability for all spiritual beliefs.  Travis talks about gratitude, kindness and inner peace.  These are universal truths.

There are no negatives for me with this program.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get deeper into their yoga practice and truly transform their life.",1343001600,196,3828,4.424460431654676
5102330,5,B007OYK32K,"The Ultimate Yogi Program is a DVD set which includes 12 yoga classes. Most of which are power yoga, but some include pranayama (breath work), meditation, and more gentle yoga or yin type classes to increase flexibility, as well as the Mountain Pose series which I feel is a practice geared towards opening the shoulders and learning to ""hear"" your body.

The music in this series is great.  It goes right along with every practice.  Each practice is about 60 minutes long, except for the Mountain Pose Series, Meditation, and Pranayama which are around 15-30 minutes each.  The program comes with a schedule to follow for all 108 days.  Ideally, you want to practice 108 days in a row, but there are ""built in"" rest days where creator Travis Eliot has you do a Yin Yoga or Gentle Yoga day and there is a day every week where you do Mountain Pose Series.  The first 36 days you do 10 minutes of meditation daily, the second 36 days 20 minutes, and finally 30 minutes daily.  The guided meditation will help you create a meditation, you can focus on one part of it or find other guided meditations or self-directed.  In this way the program is similar to Eoin Finn's Blissology, except for the practices do have a lot more variety.  The practices are mostly filmed indoors I believe in a yoga studio/set, except for Mountain Pose, Pranayama/Meditation, and Sun Salutations.  On day 36 you do 36 Sun Salutations, day 72 you do 72 and day 108 you would be doing 108 Sun Salutations.  I remember thinking ""there is no way I'm going to do 36"" but I did.  By the time day 72 rolled along I knew I would be doing 72, and I did do 108 which was very empowering.  I cried and am finding out that is a common reaction with many people who have done Ultimate Yogi 108.

The practices are varied.  The ""power"" yoga practices are similar to Bryan Kest's practices, but also varied enough that you see some different flows in there.  Cross Train has a little of everything.  Cardio moves fast and I must admit scared me the first two times, but it turned out to be something I could see great improvement in relatively fast.  Strength is always tough and upper body oriented.  The Flexibility practice is not what I expected, I expected a slow Yin Yoga-type practice and it's not, it's power and yet you get deeper and deeper in the poses.  Balance is probably the most difficult practice.  We all lose our balance as we age and this I feel is probably the most important DVD of the set for the majority of people.  It will show you your weaknesses, and also when you improve those weaknesses you feel awesome!  Detox is a wonderful twist filled practice, but Travis guides you GENTLY building up, as well as Vitality with the back bend/heart opening positions.  There is no ""jamming"" involved and if you listen to his cueing, listen to your body, and have some knowledge of yoga--these are wonderful.  Hardcore is a 20 minute ""core"" oriented routine.  It is tough, but easily modifiable as well.  Yin Yoga...wow.  It is a great shorter practice reminiscent of Long, Slow and Deep by Kest but shaves about 45 minutes off.  I love this practice.  You can do it before bed without being too hyped up to sleep or first thing in the morning.  Gentle Yoga is similar, but poses are not held quite as long and it's more dynamic.  I think it's a perfect practice for a day where you are not 110%, but you don't want to just slack off.

The schedule is set up so you do meditation almost daily, Hardcore three times a week (although sometimes I substituted other core workouts), and they build upon themselves.  Most of the practices (except for Hardcore, Mountain Pose, Pranayama, Mediation and the Sun Salutations) end with a lovely savasana and I always felt wonderful after each one.  You do a different practice each day which is similar to Blissology, i.e., the same practices for a few weeks almost in the same fashion.  It is different than American Power Yoga 60 as that program you do a different Morning Blend daily 6 days a week (7th day is off) but the same class daily.  I feel both series are good because with APY60 you can really go deeper and notice by really day 3 that your practice is a lot different than day 1.  However, the same applies to Blissology and of course Ultimate Yogi because like I mentioned above by about the third time doing Cardio I noticed a huge difference in my stamina.

There is also a dietary component to the program which is simple for people with any knowledge of nutrition.  Basically eat as close to the earth as possible, avoid alcohol, stimulants, and fried foods. There are also built in fasts.  I didn't follow the food program closely; however, lost about 23 pounds during my journey and did make better food choices as far as quality.  The biggest change I think for me is that I take a breath before reacting to things.  This is something Kurt Johnsen talks about a lot during the American Power Yoga 60 Program and he also studied with Bryan Kest.  I also find this to be a perfect series for those that want to go to classes, but for whatever reason can't attend live classes, and yet have a program set up to improve their bodies and spirits.  I don't think people who are draw to ""hardcore workouts"" will enjoy this program as it is set up, but it is a good addition to their collection and maybe will open them up to new things.  I also feel you have to have some degree of understanding of asanasa/poses to get the most out of the program.  Travis has a new DVD series called Yoga Foundations which I have not viewed yet, but is supposed to be for beginners and I think would be a good start for those new to yoga before advancing to Ultimate Yogi.",1342483200,126,5690,4.479611650485437
5102331,5,B007OYK32K,"I just started doing hot yoga so I brought the Ultimate Yogi.  SO far I have done Cross Train, Balance, Detox, Cardio and the flexibility dvds.  Travis holds the poses for a very long time.  It's a great series.  The only complaint I have for this series is the constant repetition.  Each DVD starts out with a flow sequence that may last twenty to thirty minutes.  After that sequence is over then you will get more variety for the second half hour of each dvd.  The flow sequence feels like it's almost the same on every dvd.  One may get bored doing the same sequence every day.  Each workout is an hour long and sometimes a little over an hour.  So if your someone who does not have a whole lot of time on her hands this set may not be the best bet.  The picture is excellent.  It feels like your watching an actual movie.  He's very good with instructions.  You don't even have to look at the t.v. screen.  Cross Train is a mixture of all the moves on each dvd.  Detox focuses on doing a lot of different yoga twists to detox the body.  I think the balance dvd was one of my favorites.  It was interesting enough.  The moves are not difficult.  Once the sun saluation sequence is over for each dvd you get more of a variety.  Travis has a very soothing voice that makes me feel calm and relaxed.  The postures are held for a long time.  I really feel the burn.  I see changes in my legs, arms and even less belly fat in my abdominal area.  I still would buy this set even if its repetitious.  I still have not done the Yin Yoga, or the Gentle Yoga and there are a few other dvds I have not done yet.  I can't really deduct a star because its repetitious.  There is just only so many postures you can do for yoga anyway.

I like the Ultimate Yogi.  SOme other yoga instructors I like also are:
Sarah Ivanhoe
Kathryn Budig
Tara Stiles
Another thing I like about the Ultimate Yogi is when you go to buy a yoga dvd, most yoga dvds are made for beginners only.  This is more of an intermediate to advanced workout.  The moves are not to difficult but if your out of shape it may be very hard to do but not impossible.  I'm in shape and had some trouble holding some of the poses. He seems very personal with all of his students.  Even the music is relaxing and nice to listen to.  I purchased this on amazon and received the product right away.",1341360000,7,2344,4.167785234899329
5102332,5,B007OYK32K,"The Ultimate Yogi is a gem of a system.  There are some ""easier"" workouts in the system so if you're like me, starting up again with yoga, it is very doable.  Once you feel confident and ready for more of a challenge, it's there in the rest of the dvds.  I haven't followed this as a system yet but I'm working up to it.  And I had a hip replacement, am in my mid-60s, and can't say enough good things about The Ultimate Yogi.  I just feel soooooooo good working out with this crew!",1339027200,7,482,4.085106382978723
5102333,5,B007OYK32K,"I love working out, keeping fit and entering fitness competitions. I have very little experience of doing yoga but was very curious when I read about  this system on video fitness and I checked out the Ultimate Yogi website. I really liked how the website was laid out and how I was able to see short clips of the workouts. I was sold and was very excited to start this yoga program.  The program lasts for 108 days and most of the workouts last a little over an hour. The workouts are very varied, challenging but at the same time enjoyable and energising. The music on each DVD really is wonderful and Travis is an incredible teacher, he is excellent at cueing each of the yoga moves and shows modifications for the beginner and the advanced yogi.

Previously I would only have done hIgh intensity cardio workouts and lifted heavy weights so this ultimate yogi is a complete change for me but my body is responding so well. I'm still staying in great shape and I feel this yoga is giving me a glow. I have had lots of friends commenting on my healthy skin and eyes and I really think  that is due to this yoga program and  the healthy eating plan that the program recommends. I highly recommend the Ultimate Yogi.",1337472000,9,1215,4.430493273542601
5102334,3,B007OYK32K,"First off I'm already in very good shape and wanted to search for a yoga or flexibility/fitness program that I could supplement with my normal routine. I've tried many yoga classes and often found them boring, not that hard, and a little too spiritual for me. The ultimate yogi pretty much fulfilled all those qualities with a lot more corny qualities.

First off the introduction dvd was very extremely laughable. There's a short film that I thought was a joke at first and I'd really recommend they delete that content. It shows Travis searching the streets for answers where he finds an old shop with eastern ancient books, where then a person leads him to an old man who teaches him the secrets of the universe through yoga. Sorry but this DVD is way too out there. This content will go against most Christian values and will make you question if you should even take up yoga.

The workouts are not too bad if you're into moving very slow and listening to Travis talk in this very  annoying manner. I was already disappointed with the first day calling for Crosstrain and Hardcore DVDs to be performed. They both where pretty easy and again just boring. I already thought I just wasted money (good thing there's a 36 money back guarantee) The people in class also fit the stereotype of yogis. I was really distracted by one dude I think cut scars into his chest for some design. Anyways I digress. I've tried them all and find it a challenge to rely on these dvds along (for 108 days) for my exercise. And that's what I want exercise not spiritual nirvana. Again the biggest challenge was would be making through the monotony of the workouts.

The books and other materials included are also a little misleading. The book is hardly a book, but more an insert to a cd. There's about a paragraph on the diet, not explained in detail at all.

If you're searching for a more modern approach to yoga or a routine to increase flexibility and strength I suggest Yoga Meltdown or Bob Harper's Yoga. Both would be ideal for combination of body weight strength, cardio and increase flexibility. Another great dvd system that look comparable that AMAZON doesn't sell here is one called DDP Yoga that I've heard great things about.",1336262400,33,2223,4.631979695431472
5102335,5,B007OYK32K,"I've been doing yoga on-again, off-again for several years and it was always something that I ""should"" do, like eating broccoli or flossing.  This set caught my eye and from my first workout, I have been hooked.  It's fun, it's hard, it makes me sweat, it makes me sore in places I never noticed before.

I am not very flexible, or very strong, so at times I am only approximating what the people on my TV screen are doing but each time I repeat a workout, I am a little bit better at it than I was the time before.  And I'm having fun!

I absolutely LOVE the quality of these classes, the filming, the music, the instruction.  There's a feeling of immediacy, as if I'm right there in that class.  When I look at other yoga videos now, they seem so lackluster and uninspired in comparison.  I will buy everything Travis Eliot puts out there.",1335744000,8,841,4.346153846153846
5102336,5,B007OYK32K,"I usually write reviews with detailed breakouts, but that would be a little overwhelming to do for an entire set.  I can only echo what others have already said.  Travis Eliot is an excellent instructor. He gives detailed instructions and I rarely even look at the TV as we move through the flows.  I also enjoy his life messages, motiving me to enjoy life to the fullest. The quality of the DVDs is also remarkable.  It is very evident that a lot of thought and care went into producing these.  I also had never heard of Travis before this, but now can't wait for him to release more DVDs. I would love an Ultimate Yogi 2!

You can edit the program as you see fit - I replace one day a week with barre, and continue to do some elliptical and other strength on the side.

There is a lot of variety in the program.  Excellent Power Yoga that includes Strength, Cardio, Balance, etc. But also balanced with Flexibility, Yin, and Gentle. Something for everyone.  The sequences also have an excellent flow and do a great job of hitting all the muscle groups. I have never done a ""program"" before and wasn't sure I would make it through - but I am now on Day 61 and loving it.

I consider myself to be an advanced intermediate - I am fairly strong but not overly flexible.  I am 49 with dysplasia in one hip, and some arthritis in my other knee (not really bothering me anymore except the noise it makes when I go up stairs). I was finding myself in a little bit of an exercise rut when I started this program and this program took care of that.

I am so grateful for having the oportunity to try this series. So much thought went into making this set and for someone who infrequently did yoga but was introduced to it due to my fiance being an instructor, this set has definitely made yoga a greater part of my life. While on the program I not only got stronger and increased flexibility, but I also lost 36 pounds, feel 100 times better, and look great. I love the Yin, Hardcore, and Cross Train discs the most, however they are all great. The most difficult for me was the Balance series, but you get better as you progress.

The content of the workouts fits together well. They are challenging but once you start moving they are over before you know it.

I had limited motion in my shoulders, my knees, my ankles and my back.  A combination of injuries, age, and a sit down job for 7 years or so all contributed to the physical shape I found myself in.

I have so much more strength, flexibility, range of motion than I would have thought possible when I started.  For the first time in over 10 years I feel like sexy, beauty, and grace could apply to me.

5102344,5,B007OYK32K,"This is a beautiful set that's perfect for the at-home yogi seeking a new challenge, or for any yoga student who wants to expand their practice (since most of us can't make it to class every day).

The practices are about an hour long (actually 56 to 72 minutes) every day, and three days a week you add on the 18-minute HardCore ab workout. Each practice has a different emphasis; most of them are flowing power yoga, but twice a week you slow down for a more meditative/restorative sequence. The 108-day program is broken into three 36-day phases, so essentially you change up your workouts once a month, P90X-style, which helps keep things interesting and challenging.

The instruction by Travis Eliot is top-notch. The settings, cinematography, and music (composed specially for these programs) are first-rate. The sequencing within each practice and across the whole week is well-designed so that you challenge all your muscle groups but have adequate time for recovery. Taken individually, these are some of the best yoga DVDs I've seen; as a set, they're unparalleled.

Although the set is really targeted at students with some yoga experience, a motivated beginner could use it effectively; modifications are offered and you're encouraged to do what your own body needs. The practices are intense and challenging, but don't have a whole lot of advanced postures.

About me: I've been practicing yoga for about 8 years and have around 100 yoga DVDs. Power yoga is my favorite style. I have no prior affiliation with the Ultimate Yogi team or Travis Eliot ...

8520022,1,B007OYK32K,"it seemed like a nice program. until i tried to play a dvd a second time. doesn't work. how can i do a 140 day program after having only seen each program once? this is a horrible idea. i'd really love my money back but, perhaps they are counting on my laziness. just a horrible dvd set.",1504396800,2,287,4.052631578947368
8520023,5,B007OYK32K,"I've owned the Ultimate Yogi for four years now and they have become my favorite tool for building a healthier life. Full disclosure, I'm NOT a fancy yogi, and honestly the first time I tried the programs I could do maybe half of each class. I didn't even make it through more than 30 days of the 108 day program. And yet, for me, that was already working at a higher level than I'd ever done before. About every 6 months to a year I've tried to make another pass at the 108 day program and each time I'm able to do more exercises and have longer stamina. My muscles and body have changed for the better the more I do. What I'm trying to say is that, even if the program seems overwhelmingly difficult at first, it's accessible enough that I've leaned a lot over several years by slowly chipping away at it. The quality of what the materials are is very high and it's a classic that I'll keep learning from for decades to come. Worth every penny.",1503619200,,946,4.261111111111111
