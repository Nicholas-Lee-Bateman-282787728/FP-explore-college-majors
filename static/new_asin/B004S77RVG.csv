Thank you for making me feel great about cooking again and eating my mistakes..",1313712000,5,274,4.5
4462157,5,B004S77RVG,"There's an abundance of videos available these days that will show you how to easily complete any number of recipes, but this DVD set shows you how easy it is to get comfortable in the kitchen and master the basics in a casual and fun way.  Make a mistake?  Learn from it and move on!  I like this approach as it will allow me to really get creative after mastering the foundational aspects of cooking.

It begins with the basic equipment needs of a kitchen, moves to how one does prepare food dishes, shows how to work efficiently and ultimately enjoy the total cooking experience.  There are impressive, uncomplicated recipes used as examples and a very large number of helpful hints revealed on the disks.  This is a wonderful review for those who already are cooking and it is a great confidence builder for both the experienced and especially for those just beginning.  Chef David is obviously very comfortable in the kitchen and in his delivery of information of the viewer. Chef David is a real professional and he has such a pleasant way of presenting his craft.

4462160,5,B004S77RVG,"The perfect product to build a strong foundation (and beyond) across many cooking domains, methods and techniques.

Chef David teaches, coaches, informs and entertains. His personality makes these videos very addictive.

He covers not only making fantastic dishes and meals such as Coq au Vin, Pesto Crusted Pork Tenderloin, or the breakfast standard of bacon and eggs, but also the building blocks such as kitchen set up, safety and developing knife skills. There is far too much contained in these DVD's to be fairly discussed here. He covers all aspects in a clear straight forward way, if you are good at cooking now this set will help make the jump to great, if you are a beginner you will not be for long with these DVD's.

Quite simply if your are looking for the best tool for learning to cook or just plain up your game in the kitchen this is it!",1345852800,,855,4.6118421052631575
4462161,5,B004S77RVG,"As a formation director of a Catholic religious order in charge of mentoring young men in their first year of religious life, many of them have come to us knowing nothing about cooking. Since we cook for ourselves at the house of formation, over the years the brothers have had to endure many cooking mistakes and bad-tasting dishes. Once, while preparing dinner, I asked a postulant to wash lettuce for the salad. I started another task, and when I checked on him again he had placed the lettuce into a metal basin full of water with steam rising from it. New cooks have served us beef stroganoff flavored with a bulb of garlic instead of just a clove of it and green peppers stuffed with turnip (an inedible combination). This past year I woke up many times in the middle of the night ravenously hungry because the dinner, prepared by a postulant, lacked a source of protein.

I decided to add a cooking course to the curriculum for the next class of postulants, and looking on line, discovered Chef David Robinson's, ""Learn How to Cook"" course. After watching several of the segments, I have found it to be excellent! It is perfect for the person learning how to cook because he covers all the basics of cooking in a very methodical and comprehensive way. The recipes are very easy to prepare and yet are extremely tasty.

For those with more experience in the kitchen, Chef David covers many professional cooking terms and instructions that even a well-informed cook would not know. In every segment, I learn at least a couple new facts. What I like best is that the course has expanded my repertoire of cooking. For example, I know how to poach but don't do it very often. After watching the segment on boiling and poaching, I can hardly wait to poach a chicken breast or some salmon or even an egg. Cooks often get into a rut in their menu planning. By seeing such tasty dishes prepared practically effortlessly through a variety of cooking methods, one is encouraged to learn new techniques of cooking. I love this cooking course!",1340668800,15,2037,4.639889196675901
4462162,5,B004S77RVG,"With compelling authenticity, good humor and a passion for making cooking easy and fun (and delicious), Chef David James Robinson's tips on how to ""eat your mistakes"" is both educational and entertaining--a formidable combination. The DVD series is a great find...and makes a terrific gift. His teaching style was so engaging and simple to follow, I advanced from ""intermediate novice"" to bold adventurer!",1340668800,3,405,5.444444444444445
4462163,3,B004S77RVG,"Quite frankly, I was not impressed, and since this is my second review, first one disappeared, I will try once again.  Clearly, for someone who is barely past the stage of opening cans, or mixing ingredients out of a box, this is a good cooking instruction.  Or if your knife skills are non-existent this is a good video.  However, if like me, I can easily follow a recipe, have watched enough of the food network to know how to cut an onion, then it is not for you.  I call it cooking 101 and 1/2.  Just barely above the basics, but clearly taught some of the most basic, such as how to light charcoal.  Please!  I found the review of this product to be overselling. I found myself on fast forward many times....there is so much wasted time in cutting up the same veggies over and over, good grief, once or twice is enough already. I returned it and was promptly refunded my purchase price.  One of the great benefits of shopping with Amazon.  So, if you already know how to saute a chicken breast, or cook a roast, or can bake cookies, or know how to light charcoal, move on.....this video is not for you.",1338163200,12,1107,4.334951456310679
4462164,5,B004S77RVG,"I've had the great pleasure of taking courses in person with Chef David James Robinson and he has inspired me to continue my learning with the DVD series. The DVD's are about as close to being there in person as you can get. Chef Robinson shares his love of cooking in a way that is personable and easy to understand. The lessons are well thought out, easy to follow, and very educational. If you are looking to learn how to cook, or build upon skills that you already have, this set is ideal. The lessons include many great recipes for things that I would have been too intimidated to try in the past, but not anymore. Sit back, relax, watch, learn, practice, and start cooking! You will not be disappointed - prepare yourself for rave reviews from your loved ones when you start sharing what you have learned - there's something for everyone here!",1330819200,,849,4.51948051948052
4462165,5,B004S77RVG,"I bought this dvd set instead of taking cooking classes. I was a little unsure because I don't know much about chefs and shy away from anyone with a motto, but I am very happy with this purchase. I wanted something that focused on skills and techniques (although there are plenty of recipes in this) to be more confident and creative. Chef David is great and this set is exactly what I was looking for. I've only made it through 2 lessons (or Bites) but I've already gained confidence in knowing how to better cut vegetables and what tools I really need. I like Chef David's approach to teaching in keeping it targeted to home cooks but bringing in tips from professional chefs or kitchens. His delivery is perfect and not too slow or fast. He doesn't use the motto except at the end of a lesson and then it's really just branding and not beating you over the head with it. The one thing to note is that there are 2 Bites on a disc and you have to complete the first one to access the second. The second doesn't automatically show on the menu until you complete the first, which includes about a minute of credits. I have nothing but positive thoughts about this set and highly recommend it. I'm excited about cooking now and can't wait to learn more.",1326499200,4,1251,4.396551724137931
4462166,5,B004S77RVG,"Dear Chef David,
  Thank you so much for your phenomenal approach to life by lavishing love from the kitchen. Your humble approach to presenting easy to learn culinary skills is so refreshing. You have a gracious attitude that few people demonstrate. You are a dynamic superlative communicator. Please never change, your authentic integrative character comes through so clearly in every thing you do. I am sure that we will see you soon on the food network.
Warm and Earnest Regards,

4462167,5,B004S77RVG,"with so much mediocrity around when it comes to cooking teaching, it's so exciting when you come across someone who is a master at what they do - i always find that so impressive, no matter what the field is. but then when you find someone who is a master at what they do, and then also a great teacher (a thousand times more rare!), then that is such a blessing.

to say this course was exactly what i was looking for would be an understatement. david manages to present a course that is incredibly complete and thorough, yet completely un-intimidating - no mean feat!

although david is clearly a master-chef, he still has no problem starting with the very basics and essentials, and then building form there. this combined with the step by step by step approach, and also combined with the course's healthy length (an amazing value for the price), means you really are getting a complete and very comprehensive course - basically a beginners, intermediate, and advanced course all in one.

this was great as when i started to search amazon for cooking courses, i thought i would have to piece together such a package from multiple different courses, having to deal with lots of overlapping information and conflicting approaches, but stumbling across chef david's course completely streamlined the process of my learning to cook.

i'm not saying i won't check out other courses as well - i probably will (you never stop learning!), but for getting my foot in the door, it was so nice to just have one streamlined course, with everything in one place, and a brilliant one at that! highly recommended!",1321660800,4,1602,4.751798561151079
4462168,5,B004S77RVG,"Thank you Chef David. You have been such a wonderful presence in my life and
I feel like I know you personally. You are so warm and helpful - truly a great
teacher. Plus I think you renewed my marriage with your Beef Stew and your Smashed
Potatoes with Garlic! (I'm making your Coq au Vin next)
Your cooking dvd set Eat Your Mistakes has enriched my life and given me time for myself and deliciousness for my family. It's true I've had a few mistakes and we
were able to eat one thanks to you. Your Victorian home is such a lovely setting
for your show. I've told everyone about you. It's the way you want to learn -
with a Master.  You're the best.",1313971200,5,649,4.150793650793651

8439533,5,B004S77RVG,"This DVD serious is great! It takes you through the basics of knife skills and how to properly hold a knife to all the more advanced techniques of cooking. Be it Saute', braising, pouching, roasting or the various other methods you will not be left wondering about any of the necessary steps small or large in the process. Chef David's friendly demeanor make this serious inviting and reminiscent of Julia Child's style of teaching. I also found the 2 additional specials on setting on up a successful party to extremely helpful, I can't wait to host my own get together with good food and good friends.

8439534,3,B004S77RVG,"This is a 10 DVD set. I will list the contents: 1) Tools and Tips. 2) Setup and Safety. 3) Sauting and Searing. 4) Boiling and Poaching. 5) Vegetables and Sides. 6) Soups, Stews, and Braises. 7) Taste, Seasoning, and Herbs. 8) Roasting and Sauces. 9) Salads and Sandwiches. 10) Frying. 11) Grilling and Broiling. 12) Coffee, Breakfast and Eggs. 13) Savory Baking. 14) Dessert Baking. (Bonus: Help! I'm Scared to Throw a Party, parts 1 and 2).

So this set covers a lot. I only watched a few of these, but IMHO, I found some of the recipes to be too simple. I think one can find better recipes on the DVDs by Jacques Ppin or probably Julia Childs as well. Also, Amazon shows that they only have one copy available. However, the seller is actually the one who makes the DVDs, so it's not true that there is only one copy, but they are doing that to make you think you have to get the last copy before it sells out. The maker of the DVD is a chef who looks to be the owner of a catering company, Bezalel Gables. One other good thing about getting this DVD set is that they will answer your questions by e-mail if you have any.",1396051200,,1123,4.223255813953489

I also wanted to say that I am truly impressed with the quality of their customer service. I contacted them because one of the DVDs was a little bit damaged, and they responded before 24h promising an immediate delivery to replace it. Wow!

Chef David is wonderful, down to Earth,very easy to follow and,well, just so likeable! It's just like a friend is teaching you straight from the heart. His passion for food shines through. Informative as anything. Lots of fun segments! I really enjoyed the one on herbs. I think you'll go back and watch again and again. Probably the best 50.00 I've spent in a long, long time!
