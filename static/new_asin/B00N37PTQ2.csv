6608414,1,B00N37PTQ2,"The cinematographer of this movie had some beautiful locale to shoot, but the jumpy film style and rocky treatment was annoying and added nothing to the movie, which was probably one of the worst I've seen.  Bad dialogue, poor storytelling and the acting was abysmal. A nightmare indeed.",1416096000,4,287,4.979166666666667
6608415,2,B00N37PTQ2,Just not my taste in movies.  I expect more plot and less T and A.,1415923200,,66,3.4
6608416,5,B00N37PTQ2,"A fact unknown to most film buffs is that this true epic of the low dreck genre featured the immortal Jason B. Wittier as BOTH the ""smoke operator"" and the casting director.  Cinema historians have long bickered over the important question of whether Dr. Wittier had his 'smoke' before attempting to 'cast' this flik ('fluck',  more like),  or rolled his oversized half ounce of dungweed AFTER the damage had been done,  and the fealm was doomed from the start, stuck with department store dummies for an acting roster.

I have seen more terrible cinematic efforts,  but none have sent me to the emergency room as quickly as this one did.  At first the docs suspected a gastric poison,  but pumping did no good.  Luckily I managed to use my copious tears to scrawl ""A Waterfront Nightmare"" on a nearby dusty tea tray,  and once the doctors had laved my eyeballs with concentrated embalming fluid (the same treatment the film's director received at birth,  apparently)  I calmed down enough to dash off this dire warning to you all.  Put a boot through your screens while you still can,  friends...A Waterfront Nightmare is coming to steal a precious slice of your total life span.

I love Amazon Instant Video.  It's a bunch of really dedicated biznez people whose only goal is to pile up the shekels,  film quality and long-term public satisfaction be damned.  With a national intelligence average (adults 9 and over) now down around the level of a 1950's sixth-grader in one of the five largest urban areas of the earlier time,  and bona fide reports of widespread cannibalism/crack addiction sweeping the rural hinterlands of the mighty USA,  who needs scripts with depth and innovation,  civilized  production standards,  and something better than a film crew in which the smoke-blower is the same bloke as did the CASTING?  I wonder if Orson Welles also trimmed the toenails of his cast members and kept the studio automobiles in good trim,  when he was writing and directing?

 Actually this reviewer has it on good inside source authority that Amazon very nearly passed on leasing this great feature for Prime distribution...many execs felt that A Waterfront Nightmare was too 'highbrow' for most of today's viewers.",1415923200,4,2223,4.921832884097035
6608417,1,B00N37PTQ2,"""OMG"" What the heck did I just spend the last 94 minutes watching? The first scenes of this movie showed promise because of the landscape cinematography, however as soon as the dialogue started I knew I was in for a rough ride.
It starts as the usual college kids on a drunked break from school scenario staying at a remote? cabin in redneck country. Truly original (NOT)!!! Upon arriving at the cabin the college kids party is interrupted by the landlord and some neighbors ? who want to party and some more uninvited party crashers drop in soon after hearing their music (none is heard during this time) Everyone that stops by is weird. Oh, I can't forget the guy shooting video of them who first started filming at the liquor store (I guess he followes them to their cabin?)They are like this magnet pulling in everyone around them including the liquor store guy and the pizza guy too. Again, everyone they meet is weird and why they let them stay is beyond me. The killings are infrequent and spaced far apart while the rest of the time is filled with bad dialogue, acting and dumb and odd behavior.
The writing/dialogue is just awful along with the acting and misdirection thats very closely followed by the choppy editing. The story jumps/skips from scene to scene without any fluidity at times and even though the story isn't hard to figure out it is hard to follow. The characters actions are just plain silly and are about as far from reality as you can imagine without the use of mind altering drugs.
The pacing much like everything else involved with this production is all over the place, but mostly slow. Again, the killings are spread far apart( and not missed) and are pretty benign lacking any real gore imagery and the rape scene is also not graphic and without nudity as was other sex scenes. There is a fair amount of cursing including the f...word thought. and a lot of drinking during the movie.
I will gladly give this -5 stars. Is it the worst movie ever? No, but it is still within sight!",1415232000,11,2012,4.560773480662983
6608418,1,B00N37PTQ2,Probably the worst indie film I've seen. The script is predictable and shot selections are very confusing and amateur at best. The leading actors seem overwhelmed and inexperienced. I wasted a good 30mins that I'll never get back again.,1414886400,8,236,5.076923076923077
6608419,5,B00N37PTQ2,"Great script, the story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  Hot young girls, blood and booze - what more could you ask for in a film of this nature.  Definitely worth watching and hopefully there will be a sequel!",1411862400,4,229,4.181818181818182

6608422,1,B00N37PTQ2,"Someone watched Apocalypse Now, dipped into their trust fund, called their buddies and made a film. This film is bad, I mean, really bad. A group of friends go to the lake for the most boring spring break ever. There's a bunch of awkward standing around, lots of slow dialogue, and tons of empty beer bottles. Plus, we get to look at the shoes of each character, not just once apiece, but a bunch of times. Continuity is a major flaw in this film, folks turn up in the strangest places at the weirdest times, daylight, nighttime, it's just annoying. I don't know if the director was trying to convey the message of movement with all of the foot shots, but it was just about the only thing that moves in the film.
This one is a big old NO, save your time and no, it's really bad. I get it, the director/writer/funder/camera operator is trying to be edgy and deep, show a lot of range and imagination. There's some promise in that, good try, hats off to you, congrats on the awards.
Bonus drinking game! Every time someone mentions college take a shot, every time the actors are standing around awkwardly take two shots.",1457049600,,1118,4.458536585365854
6608423,1,B00N37PTQ2,"A few impressive, if derivative, crane shots do not a movie make. Acting was sometimes pretty good, but mainly on the level of an inconsistent high school drama club; and, as others have noted, further undermined by atrocious looping. Enough run-time padding to fill a king-size pillow. However, it was the sheer incoherence of the script, underscored by the catch-as-catch-can direction that really sunk this turkey. (But, do note that if, like me, you don't stop watching something just because it sucks, there is a [very] minor pay-off with the last line.)",1453507200,,559,5.086956521739131

6608429,1,B00N37PTQ2,"Not much to say about this movie. Terrible audio, terrible story, terrible acting. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but it was just too bad even for someone like me who likes cheesy horror movies. Unless you're just looking to waste an hour and a half or so of your life skip this movie. The other reviews say it all.",1444003200,,328,4.140625
6608430,1,B00N37PTQ2,"Wow, that was a remarkably bad movie.  If you forget that the acting is horrible and half the time the are talking they sound like they are on a sound stage the movie is still really really terrible.  I have never seen a movie with a group of people as lazy and mindless as these people are.  Their friends are getting killed and disappearing, they know something terrible is going on but instead of trying to get away or protect themselves they drink.  They sometimes even come up with the brilliant plan to get up off their butts and do something then they are like nah lets sit here and drink because that solves everything, we won't have to think about it.  The one girl who is suppose to be the good and smart one out of the group comes up with the worst ideas and has the most insane logic I have ever heard.  The writer tried to put in some unexpected things by constantly trying to place blame on several other people as the culprit but it just got washed out by all the idiocy.  This is one movie I actually could not wait for them to be killed, they were probably to stupid and drunk to know they were being killed.  Skip this movie there is no boredom bad enough that this can become worth watching.",1443657600,2,1210,4.253275109170306
6608431,1,B00N37PTQ2,"Yep - one of those films that are indeed as HORRIBLE as everyone says.

The only thing that sounded somewhat convincing was when the dude went crazy and started that growling voice. Other than that, it didn't make much sense to me, like why was the dude filming?

Not going to go into too much detail here.  All you need to know is that every facet of this movie is BAD, yes I put that all in caps for a reason.  I watched the whole thing, when I start a movie I am committed to finishing it, wish I hadn't.  Beware if you watch this, it is really, really, really bad.",1421280000,,442,3.932584269662921
6608442,1,B00N37PTQ2,Quite Possibly the worst Horror movie I've ever seen.  Everything about this screams amateur.  For god's sake the voices were obviously dubbed in over the video (several characters are even credited as having separate voice actors).  To try and hide this most actors are filmed from behind or off screen while they speak.  Also the sound mastering is awful as voices switch from left to right channels frequently during shots.  The film itself is also a convoluted mess.,1420675200,,470,4.9743589743589745

6608445,1,B00N37PTQ2,"Yikes. The entire movie seems to be ""looped,"" that is to say they decided to send the actors into a studio to re-record the dialogue for better quality. Instead, it sounds as if the entire cast is on an episode of Fresh Air on NPR, with their faces pressed up against a microphone. It sounds awful and fake. Some of the actors have a hard time syncing up with their original lip movement. Not sure why they decided to do this.",1420243200,2,426,4.271604938271605

6608447,1,B00N37PTQ2,"If you're going with the ""psycho in the woods"" genre, and you want it to be entertaining, you have to bring something at least a little different to the table.  This film relied on all the devices horror movie fans are familiar with.  Most shocking/unbelievable part of the movie?  The realization that no one has a cell phone, or access to a land line.  It's never mentioned in the movie.  A bunch of 20 somethings, and no phones?  Everything else in the film is more plausible than that.
  I'm always curious about how these movies get made.  The people putting it together have to know it likely won't be very good.  The world need another slasher flick like it needs another zombie movie.",1419638400,,692,4.5528455284552845

6608452,1,B00N37PTQ2,none of it makes any sense whatsoever. It's so incoherent; it was as though they just threw together a bunch of ideas without attempting to pull it all together which results in a completely maniacal disjointed mess.

6608454,1,B00N37PTQ2,"First off, happily, this one's free on Amazon Prime, so I didn't waste any money on this disaster. Unhappily, I did spend some time watching it, due to the very cool artwork and my Pavlovian response to Palme-Dor-esque ""awards wreaths"" on DVD covers. But... to help you avoid making the same mistake, I offer the following...

It IS as bad as the one- and two-star reviews state and it's one of the rare films that makes you wish you could just give it a ""zero"". It's abysmally acted, lacks any scares or thrills, and is simply just another c-horror, microbudget, weekend-shoot video you'll regret having wasted any time even giving a test-viewing. The dialog is oddly ""off"" due to some odd recording process used by the audio tech and director...
