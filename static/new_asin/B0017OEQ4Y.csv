A few differences in the QiGong from Dr Xu's teaching,but they are minor
Nice setting/videography",1452902400,2,113,5.705882352941177

i LOVE Guigen Qigong. it's a wonderful practice. but i'm not a fan of Suzanne Friedman's video. this video is barely 30 minutes long, and she could have offered much more information, better angles, better demonstration of the movements and transition points, and then maybe i wouldn't have been so put off by the price.

Simon Blow is a Qigong teacher in Australia, and his video is longer, better, AND it costs less! i bought both of them because i'm a teacher and i wanted to compare and contrast the two and piece together for myself the best of both videos. Simon Blow's 75-minute video goes through the exercises with crisp form. he gives a MIRROR IMAGE demonstration so you don't have to flip the form in your mind while trying to learn it. his video has multiple chapters so you can navigate through the various exercises. and at the end of the teaching portion he offers an uninterrupted complete demonstration of the form, followed by the all-important instruction to meditate afterwards. Suzanne Friedman's video has none of that. Plus, there's a segment in the earth element exercise that Simon performs, but is absent entirely from Friedman's version!

neither video does justice to the importance of breath and intent, which is sad because without those two keys you're really just going through the motions. but what both the videos lack in the basics can easily be picked up elsewhere.

videos like Friedman's always leave me feeling like the author was more concerned with turning a profit than with offering a good quality video.

Guigen Qigong is a wonderful system of exercises. i would highly recommend it, particularly to anyone with a chronic illness for whom qigong has been recommended. but i would recommend Simon Blow's version over this one. he's not on Amazon, but he'll turn up on google.

i should probably also add that i am NOT a student of Simon Blow, and i have no vested interest in promoting his videos. but there are very few DVD options for learning Guigen Qigong, and his video is a good one.

Suzanne Friedman is a great teacher. i know that her students really love her. but she really could have offered so much more. As a matter of fact, ALL OF HER VIDEOS ARE DUBIOUSLY SHORT IN LENGTH. i can only assume that they also offer only the bare minimum, yet at a premium price.",1260489600,8,2471,4.6536697247706424
