8502912,4,B006PTL1PS,"The transfer quality of this DVD-R movie is a bit rough and ragged but watchable.  The plot involves a magazine called FLICK.  Its health conscious publisher (Richard Gaines), a stickler for the truth, wants the editor (Chester Morris) to hire a photographer named Pat (Nancy Kelly) based on a single photo he had published of a plane crash.  Said photo was staged and hes a she.  The editor is overjoyed with the mix-up, better an attractive woman to work with than a guy.  But.  She isn't interested in his advances and invents a brother to keep him at bay.  Her boyfriend shows up so she has to pass him off as her brother.  Complications ensue, this is a screwball comedy...........right up to the point when it abruptly changes tone and decides to get serious when the photographer is arrested and charged with murder.  They toss in a gimmick at the very end so everything can work out to all parties satisfaction.  Its a weird, unbelievable premise, a mystery of sorts, thats entertaining enough but it feels more like a sitcom episode than a movie.  I liked it but its average at best.",1455926400,,1092,4.635416666666667

8502915,2,B006PTL1PS,"I bought 3 movies I thought were Boston Blackie so that is the number one disapointment, none of them were. Of the 3, sad to say this was the best but still it's not very good. It's suppose to have funny bits in it but it's not funny. Chester Morris is a magazine editor, and things get published without knowing what was in the magazine? Please. Then he lets his star photographer go to jail for murder, he's bragging he'll get her out he can fix it. She almost goes on trial for the murder. The whole thing is not believable, not even enough to say oh well it's ok for a bit of fluff, but remember it is be best of the 3 I bought. So there are 2 more that are worse than this. I don't recommend you buy it, but that's just me.",1347062400,9,728,3.993150684931507
