Since Bill & Ben are introduced in this one, they show them quite frequently in the following videos, but they don't show Boco enough. We all know he has the hardest job on the Island of Sodor, keeping the twins in order and making sure they stay out of trouble. Some more twins are introduced on this video also, Donald & Douglas. Sir Topham Hatt only ment to find one of them and plans to send one away. Here are the story stops:

THOMAS, PERCY & THE DRAGON 5/5:

Percy still teases Thomas about the time he thought he was a ghost and to Thomas, this is getting very old indeed. One night Percy is abandoned at an old siding due to a broken signal box. Percy is scared and wishes he could go home as he sees everyone else puffing happily to the shed. Meanwhile, Thomas is sent to the harbor to pick up a rather mysterious load. On the way back, Thomas will pass Percy's siding and boy is Percy in for a surprise.

DONALD & DOUGLAS 5/5:

Donald & Douglas are Scottish twin engines, but Sir Topham Hatt had only wanted one of them and plans to send the other one away. But who? First Donald has an accident with a signal box and Sir Topham Hatt gets mad at him, he was planning to keep Donald and send Douglas away. Next, Douglas helps James with some troublesome trucks but accidently works too hard and breaks the brakevan. Now Sir Topham Hatt doesn't know who to keep or who to send away.

THE DEPUTATION 5/5:

All the engines are very sad that Sir Topham Hatt wants to send one of the scottish twins away. Percy decides to ask Edward for some advice and Edward says that the engines need a deputation, where one engine tells Sir Topham Hatt about their problem. So the engines make Percy their deputation. He bravely steps up to the challenge but will he be brave enough to tell Sir Topham Hatt about Donald & Douglas.

A SCARF FOR PERCY 6/5:

Percy has always wanted a scarf for his funnel and all the other engines think he is crazy, but Percy still has his dreams. One day, when Sir Topham Hatt is taking visitors around the island, Percy decides to sneak up on the coaches but he is so quiet that the baggage claim doesn't here him either. After Percy's silly accident, he will finally have a scarf, but by mistake.

THE DISEASEL 2.5/5:

One day, Bill & Ben's cars mysteriously dissapear. The drivers find a patch of oil where their cars were and find out that a diesel stole their cars. Their drivers take off their names and numbers so the diesel won't think there are two of them. So Bill & Ben set off to find the diesel and get their cars back.

TIME FOR TROUBLE 4/5:

Sir Topham Hatt gives Gordon a rest and has James take the Express. Meanwhile, Toby is on his way to the works to be repaired. He stops at a signal for a drink of water but the signalman says that they must leave immediately to clear the line for James and the Express. But Toby tank doesn't hold much water and he ends up stranded on the mainline. Now James will have to push Toby and pull his train at the same time.

EDWARD'S EXPLOIT 5/5:

Edward has to take a passenger train back to the station one night. The train is very heavy and hard for Edward to pull. When he is driving down the line, his coupling rods break and all the passengers have to help fix them. Tired but triumphent, Edward starts again, will he make it to the station?
