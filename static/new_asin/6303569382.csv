7852135,2,6303569382,"Known under several names (DEATH TRAP, HORROR HOTEL, LEGEND OF THE BAYOU etc), EATEN ALIVE is Tobe Hooper's follow up to TCM also featuring Marilyn Burns, this bombed when released.
The movie begins with a young Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund trying to rape a platinum blond hooker, who is then thrown out of her brothel and seeks refuge at a hotel run by a deranged pervert named Judd (Neville Brand); who looks like a Manson family reject, and who obviously has no experience with women... so in order to ease his sexual frustration Judd feeds his guests to a crocodile that lives in his yard after dismembering them with his trusty ax, just like any normal person would do, right? (Note to the dim: this is a rhetorical question). Marilyn Burns gets to do more of her famous screaming while  Nerdy Nev chases her little girl around his property with a scythe.
Unsurprisingly years ago the SPCS tried to ban this; you know, in case any New Zealanders who had croocdiles living in their basements (Or rabid sheep. Haha) got ideas placed in their heads.
When will they get a life?",1039564800,,1081,4.659685863874346
7852136,3,6303569382,"Marilyn Burns again teams with Tobe Hooper in his follow-up to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" This time the setting is a isolated motel in the Louisiana bayou, run by yet another group of strange characters. With a swamp full of famished crocodiles, one can only guess what happens to a lot of the guests. Sheriff Stuart Whitman is about to find out. This overlooked Hooper shocker is worth a second look. Like ""Texas"", it gets sweat-inducing with a lot of screaming. Also stars Neville Brand, Mel Ferrer, and Carolyn Jones. Horror fans note: Robert Englund appears as a sleazy john, as does Kyle Richards, who played ""Lindsay"" in ""Halloween"" two years later. William Finley, who later had a small role in Hooper's ""The Funhouse"", plays a hapless motel guest here. Marilyn Burns can still scream.",999216000,,796,4.9037037037037035
