5715466,5,B002ZIZKQE,"I saw the movie VICTOR with 2 friends and we all loved the movie. We saw it in the theatre. The acting is very realistic. My 17 year old son saw it too and he loved it! My son who loves history,really enjoyed the 1960's setting. It is based on a true story. I tried not to cry, but the actors all did a great job, it felt real. I will definitely be buying this to give to friends,youth pastors and others. It is not a preachy movie, it shows the struggles of a teenager who became addicted to drugs and his family's attempts to help him. And how God gave Victor the power to break free from the addictions. Like I said it is based on a true story, so for those who are battling addiction or know someone who is, there IS hope. Call out to Jesus as Victor did. God bless.",1497571200,5,770,4.0064935064935066

8580315,5,B002ZIZKQE,"Gritty and raw, this movie is unlike some other faith based movie I have seen. A true before and after story about Jesus Christ transforming lives. The main character takes us through his many trials, tribulations, and failures. Ultimately through the firm discipline and love of his father, his mother's faith in God and prayers, support groups, and a former enemy he is triumphant. Victor is living proof that God can change a person's life for the better if Jesus is welcomed into that person's heart. A testament to God's desire and power to deliver us from our own self destruction and the penalty of spiritual death. As you watch this film you may be moved to tears, but for sure you will be encouraged. The DVD includes a documentary on the real Victor Torres ""One More Life"".",1505520000,,783,4.681159420289855
