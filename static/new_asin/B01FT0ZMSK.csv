7751803,5,B01FT0ZMSK,"This is a major good movie story!  It is very sensitive to the subject culture and community, but is also stark like the reality that exists for many, not all, who live there. The direction and production value are top notch.  I highly recommend it and will myself watch it again sometime in the near future.",1466726400,4,308,4.482142857142857

7751805,5,B01FT0ZMSK,I was able to see this at a film festival and I couldn't believe how well this film was done! Its a must see!,1465862400,,109,3.5833333333333335
7751806,5,B01FT0ZMSK,Not much to say about this.  You don't buy music unless you know you like it and you know what you're getting when you order it. It is what it is.,1472342400,,146,3.7096774193548385
7751807,2,B01FT0ZMSK,Interesting but did not care for bad language.,1471478400,,46,4.875
7751808,3,B01FT0ZMSK,"I wanted to like this so much more than I did.  Very realistic - painfully so.  Slow.  No music, which would've enhanced the plot.  Okay acting and writing.  Very sad to see the condition of the reservation.",1470355200,,207,4.486486486486487
7751809,5,B01FT0ZMSK,Excellent depiction of a gritty reality that saddens my heart.,1469577600,,62,5.3
7751810,5,B01FT0ZMSK,It was a glimpse into a foreign country within our own borders.,1469318400,2,63,4.333333333333333
7751811,1,B01FT0ZMSK,"Poor acting, boring story",1468627200,,25,5.5
7751812,4,B01FT0ZMSK,It was a modern day movie about Pine Ridge Reservation.  It was true to the story line and I thought it was an accurate depiction of life there.  It should invoke compassion for the Lakota people.,1467849600,4,196,4.416666666666667
7751813,5,B01FT0ZMSK,"A great movie. Great acting. Wonderfully filmed and written with heart. The film  draws the viewer in to see life thru different eyes and feel.... For some it maybe slow moving. When you think how much Native Americans have been shattered and brutalized over the past 300 or so years, it's going to take time to recover. Flickers of hope. Flickers of life. That's what's in this film. A present day picture for all too many People on a long journey back to becoming themselves. Healing slowly in the midst of pain, proverty, and chaos....and learning to hold on to what matters most. You have to be strong to survive that life.",1467417600,8,627,4.598214285714286
7751814,4,B01FT0ZMSK,Very sad though that The PIne Ridge Reservation is so poor ..... looks so barren .... where does all the government money go the reservation should be receiving ????,1467417600,2,165,4.724137931034483
8761478,4,B01FT0ZMSK,"Not as good as ""The Rider"". It is the first movie made by this director and is a very good movie and interesting. I bought it to see how she had progressed from this movie to ""The Rider"". Both well worth watching and learning about life in the Dakotas from an Native American point of view.....",1534636800,,294,4.267857142857143

8761480,5,B01FT0ZMSK,"What a gorgeous movie!  Real people, not actors.  ""Winter's Bone"" of the West.",1529452800,,78,4.923076923076923
8761481,5,B01FT0ZMSK,"I watched a You Tube video about how this was made.  This film is by an Asian woman, she went everywhere to get funding for a longer better movie, but couldn't get funded.  Finally Forest Whittaker said he'd help fund her but she had to make this on the fly.  This movie has real people from the Pine Ridge Reservation in So. Dakota as actors.  Though the story is fictional, the girls house really did burn down and the scene where she goes to view what happened is live, as it happened and true.  The Asian woman wrote it in.
  If you want a glimpse on what the rez is really like, you see the housing, cars and the BADLANDS.  I want to try Sundance channel, but chose to buy this movie at $9.99 to help support all involved with it.",1500163200,8,735,4.163120567375887

8761483,5,B01FT0ZMSK,"Reservation life. This movie shows the struggle of young Native American men trying to do the best they can living on the rez. The young man at the center of this movie actually has a brain and uses it, however, he is surrounded by stupid, knuckle-dragging, Native American men who don't have brains....worthless, dim witted young men who deserve to live on a rez. The poor kid feels he should have a sense of tradition. WRONG!!!!
Get off the rez and make your own way.
Typical Native American boys, if they see you are trying to make it out, and they think you have a dollar more than they do, they burn up your things to make sure you stay in the rez like they have to.....",1497657600,,675,4.322834645669292
8761484,1,B01FT0ZMSK,"Please get some real Native Americans for these roles. Half of the time I wasn't sure if I was watching white people with tans or what. There are a ton of darker, Native Americans out there who are enrolled with their tribes and look very Native American. This was supposed to be about the Pine Ridge reservation and I can tell you, the people on Pine Ridge look nothing like these people.",1489190400,,389,4.416666666666667
8761485,5,B01FT0ZMSK,"It was thoughtful, beautiful, and offered good insight into some of the problems facing the good people on Pine Ridge.",1476403200,,118,4.95
8761486,5,B01FT0ZMSK,This is a touching movie that explores the relationship of a young Native American girl and her older brother. I have no personal experience with reservation life but the director and actors are from the Pineridge Reservation.,1474156800,2,226,5.135135135135135
