8394921,5,B0023TZ3KI,"One helluva great good bad and just good Australian women in prison soap operas from 1979, used to watch it in it's condensed US syndicated run, and it is great to see it again in it's unexpurgated original format.",1483920000,,214,4.512820512820513
8394922,5,B0023TZ3KI,"Continuing from where we left off in the first volume we see events wrap up with Vera Bennett (Fiona Spence) and her lover (Bill Hunter) as well as several new inmates appearing in Wentworth as well as a new male member of staff Jim Fletcher (Gerard Maguire).
On the inmates side we see Joyce Martin (Judy Nunn) pop up briefly to add to the drama along with Antonia McNally (Pat Bishop) who shows just who is ruling the roost at Wentworth. Bella Albrecht (Liddy Clark), Edith Wharton (the late Colleen Clifford) and Melinda Crosse (Lulu Pinkus) add to the behind bars girls.
We see Dr Peter Clements (Carrillo Gantner) take an unwanted look at goings-on within the Wentworth staff and get the chance to see Karen Travers (Peta Toppano) away from Wentworth. We say goodbye to Lynn Warner (Kerry Armstrong).
One of the worst epsiodes of the whole 692 epsiode series features on the very first disc - episodes 35 which features the siege at the Woods home in which Noeline Bourke's (Jude Kuring) brother Colin causes chaos.
The late actress Penny Ramsey also makes her debut here as Leila Fletcher, a character that will feature from time to time upto volume 4. Penny also reappears in the series much later in episodes in the 600's.
All in all the story progresses fairly well featuring a genuine threat to Bea's (Val Lehman) leadership of the women. All good stuff in these episodes from 1979.
Check out the hair, the fashions, the prices, the incidental music and much much more in this fantastic addition to the Prisoner collection. A must buy for any fans of this late night soap.",1313366400,,1582,4.694244604316546
