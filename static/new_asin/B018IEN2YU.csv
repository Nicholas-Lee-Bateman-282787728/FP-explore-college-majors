8742428,5,B018IEN2YU,"This very well done movie sheds light on the tragic events surrounding Benghazi. I'm quite sure there was some dramatic license taken for the sake of the movie, but if half of the mistakes made by ""bad judgment calls"" no wonder 4 men died. Anyway great, great movie!",1468886400,,266,4.5625
