4519548,5,B00514XIFE,It really gives an ample view of Guadi and his work. It goes into just enough detail. I'm visiting Barcelona I'm a few months and this is the perfect first part of doing my homework before the trip.,1394409600,,198,4.2368421052631575

4519550,2,B00514XIFE,"The quality of the DVD was not good second rate, with today's technology I expected higher resolution. I watched it once and put it on the shelf to collect dust.

4519553,4,B00514XIFE,"This is a beautiful, informative  video.  I used it for a book club program, and it was much enjoyed by the members.  My one complaint was the difficulty in  understanding the comments of one of the main interviewees.  His accent was so strong that we Americans could not understand his English. The ones that were translated were much more helpful.",1319846400,4,349,4.75

8452359,5,B00514XIFE,So many of whoever you can think of wind up being followers of somebody else. Perhaps almost everything he did was over the top. The fact that he had people who were willing to invest in him and see his work finished is a testament to his work in itself. Just a complete different way of doing things. I find the thought of laying a brick at this cathedral pleasant. Although I most likely never will. There are no shortage of those who are like Gaudi and they don't really need recognition but I find it pleasant that some are. Architecture as a whole is more entertaining because of him. It makes you think. He makes you think.,1436054400,,629,4.338983050847458
