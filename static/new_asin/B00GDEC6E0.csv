8622330,4,B00GDEC6E0,"I already have the first two DVD's of the Warner Bros. Academy Awards Animation Collection when I decided to buy this and complete the set. Here are the pros and cons of this DVD.

PROS:
""From A to Z-Z-Z-Z"" has the original 1954 Looney Tunes opening and closing rings restored in their entirety.

CONS:
""Jerry's Cousin"" is sourced from the 1990's Turner TV broadcast print, albeit with remastered audio.
Although the CinemaScope cartoons on this DVD are presented in their original theatrical aspect ratio, none of them are enhanced for widescreen TVs, except ""Touch&eacute;, Pussy Cat!""

Overall, I'd recommend this and the previous two Warner Bros. Academy Awards Animation DVD's to animation fans alike!

8622332,5,B00GDEC6E0,"This specific DVD covers nominees from the mid-40's up into the 1960's, and is a pretty good combination of WB, Tom and Jerry, and Tex Avery cartoons (One Droopy Knight, however, was directed by Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, a couple of years after Tex Avery left MGM for Universal).",1417478400,,281,4.64
