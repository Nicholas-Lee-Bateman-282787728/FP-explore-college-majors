7971173,1,B00006L92D,"I caught this ""film"" on cable last night, and I'm sorry I did. Basically, some cameraman is running around talking to assorted rappers about nothing in particular. Most of the time, the rappers are lamenting on how non-fans think all they do is sit around and get lifted, and when they're interviewing Jadakiss, for example, he's sitting there smoking a joint! Did I miss something?
Another thing is that there are a lot of testimonies from some extremely wack rappers (Masta Killa, Sticky Fingaz, Jermaine Dupri). And why in the world was Dalvin DeGrate there? In short, this film feels like The Real World: Rap Edition, but with no script to follow. I've only seen this once and I think I'll keep it that way.

There are interviews with artists such as Snoop Dog, Masta Killa, Sunz of Man, Jadakiss,Sticky Fingaz, etc.  The guy making the flick is puffing ""L""s the whole time with the rappers, and just having casual conversation.  I thought it was a sick soundtrack with intimate interviews that are informative at least, and incredibly entertaining regardless.  Worth checking out, and definitely worth 10 bucks.  There aren't enough hip-hop documentaries and this one will be a classic.",1086307200,2,616,5.11
