2235216,4,B0007R4T08,"As the title suggests, this one is awful in a good way. Bad acting, horrible special effects, kind of dumb story line. I love ""B"" movies and this one's definelty on my watch list.",1252540800,,179,4.294117647058823
2235217,2,B0007R4T08,"Neither of these movies qualify as ""So Bad They are Good"".  Of the two, ""Village of the Giants"" is the more watchable, but not likely to generate much repeated viewing.

The film follows a gang of groovy teens in 1965, that are after a super-growth formula invented by a whiz kid with a chemistry set, played by Ron Howard.  Once they get the formula, they become giants then take over the town, making the square ""over 30"" adults follow their rules.

There's not meant to be suspense,instead, the movie plays for guffaws,  like when giant ducks show up at a gogo club, the clubgoers just see them as groovy, dancing ducks or when the camera zooms in on a giant woman, as she picks up a regular sized man and holds him at her cleavage.  This dance sequence is way too long.

On the good side, the film does capture the music, dancing and fashions of the 60's, somewhat like the beach party movies, but these are the bad teens with more suggestive moves. The guffaws are  sometimes funny and the giantism jokes capture the mid-sixties obsession with bikini's.  They are laughable for showing what was once was so risque, is now tame.  But,  after awhile, the one note jokes run dry.

So, although some promise, the film never fully delivers.  If interested, it's worth renting first to see if it's the type of movie you would want to see more than once. For me, I vote ""no"".

""Attack of the Puppet People"" takes itself more seriously, so had a chance for good, unintentional laughs.  However, it's just a bad movie.  This reverses the ""Village of the Giants"" by centering around a scientist that makes people small instead of tall.  Again, the one note plays out rather quickly.

Both movies are strictly for diehard B-movie fans.  If you are a ""once in awhile"" B movie fan, such as me, there are better B movies out there to hold your interest while waiting for the laughs.",1199664000,2,1873,4.537313432835821
2235218,4,B0007R4T08,"This 2-fer is worth it, if not only for Village of the Giants.  You get a front seat to the mid-60s Sunset Strip teenage scene, replete with a wild club performance by the Beau Brummels (and as they play, you get Toni Basil doing the monkey and the frug from inside a cage).  This movie is about teenagers versus adults, teenagers from an upscale neighborhood versus teenagers from working class families, teenager versus the law . . . And you get a young Ron Howard playing a geeky whiz kid who accidentally creates ""goo,"" a concoction which, when ingested, turns you into a giant.  Whacky 60s movie fans will love this one.  Attack of the Puppet People is a worthwhile film in its own right - a tale of a creepy and desperate dollmaker who turns anyone who crosses him into one of his dolls.",1189382400,15,793,4.448275862068965
2235219,4,B0007R4T08,"When you think of the great directors of American cinema, the name Bert I. Gordon does not come to mind.  A creator of cheesy science fiction B-movies, many of his films dealt with giant animals (grasshoppers in The Beginning of the End, ants in Empire of the Ants, etc.) or people (like with War of the Colossal Beast).  With Village of the Giants, he revisits this theme with a twist; Attack of the Puppet People, however, depicts the reverse idea.

In Attack of the Puppet People, June Kenny plays a new secretary for a kindly old dollmaker who somehow has created a shrinking machine.  He is sort of like a psychotically delusional Mr. Rogers who seems really nice but hates having people leave him, to the point where he shrinks them to doll-size and puts them into suspended animation.  Despite the title, the ""puppet people"" don't do any real attacking; instead, they are merely intent on getting restored to their proper sizes.  With low budget actors and effects, this film is far from great but does have its moments.

Village of the Giants, however, features some big name actors in early roles, most notably Ronny (Ron) Howard and Beau Bridges.  Veering away from the more ""serious"" films, this movie is more comedy that horror.  Howard is a preadolescent genius who accidentally creates a growth formula, which is stolen and ingested by Bridges and his friends.  After becoming giants, they become the ultimate teen rebels and try to enforce laws against adults.  The effects may be poor, but the movie itself is an amiable bit of a fluff, more interested in showing teenage girls jiggle to nice but forgettable tunes than with any sort of coherent plot.

I've always had an affection for Village of the Giants since seeing it as a small kid (and not since).  Like some of the sillier Disney films (particularly the early Kurt Russell sci-fi comedies), they don't get better as you get older.  They may be deeply flawed movies, but I still enjoyed them for what they were, so I am giving them a low four stars; it may be more than they truly merit, but with these sorts of movies, fun always trumps quality.",1164326400,13,2120,4.694594594594594

Side A: ""ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE""

Fret not, no puppet people attack.  The puppet people are, in fact, regular joes and janes that have unhappy contact with a master doll maker who just can't stand to part with people whom he holds dear.  So this affable old man reduces them to Ken & Barbie size and keeps them in cannisters only to let them out occasionally to socialize and have a party.  His plan is ultimately foiled with the help of a cat and a little girl who likes playing with his dolls.  Great effects for the time; they still come across quite well especially in fabulous black and white.  This has the feel of a good Twilight Zone episode and is the far better of the two features.  Starring John Agar, star of any number of B movie fare, and prolific television actor John Hoyt (I remember him best from the Twilight Zone episode ""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?"" where stranded bus passengers hang out at a diner as they wait for the road to be cleared; while they wait they realize that there is now one more of them than there was supposed to be and they don't know who it is.  Hoyt's character deflects and turns questions around on the other passengers as tension mounts in this little slice of paranoia.  At story's end when the barkeep finally sees them all leave he turns around to surprisingly see Hoyt back at the bar and Hoyt proceeds to tell the barkeep that he is an alien and that the earth is about to be taken over by his race.  But it doesn't end there...).  3.75 stars.

Side B: ""VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS""

This teens run amok hamfisted favorite I'm sure benefitted from any of the drug-fueled hazes and rock 'n roll hype ups of those who originally watched it.  It's a bit hard on the eyes today what with it's silly psychedelia, minutes upon minutes of footage of the youth of the day shaking their groove thangs at almost any moment, and shoddy effects including wooden oversized hands, feet, and bosoms (!) of our gigantic teenage truants.  Ripped off H.G. Well's ""The Food of the Gods"" storyline here we have a young Ron Howard (yep, the Ritchie Cunningham from Happy Days) who makes some goo that turns pets and farm animals biggerino.  Some hop happy mean teens, led by a young Beau Bridges (I did not know that he was ever young!), eat some of the goo and take over the town putting to flight all of the unhip, uncool parental units.  Teen Tommy Kirk (yep, from ""Old Yeller"" and other Disney family favorites) plays Mike, the level-headed young man who stands up to the titanic bullies.  You could certainly do worse than this slice of silliness...but you'd have to be trying!  2.5 stars.",1357516800,,2661,4.481327800829876
