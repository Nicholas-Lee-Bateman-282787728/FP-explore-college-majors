2877639,5,B000S0GYPW,"Just got this set for my daughter for her 5th birthday.  She has really been enjoying all the different stories.  We have only made it through 25-30% of them so far since there are so many.  The short films are nicely done for each story and they usually stick to the same style of artwork/illustrations as the original story. Some have complained about ""outdated graphics"" but I like that they stick to the original style.  And they are somewhat older as even my husband remembers seeing some of these 'back in the day'. When we watched ""In the Night Kitchen"" by Maurice Sendak, it prompted us to dig out our ""Art of Maurice Sendak"" book to read all about the background behind the story & artwork.  Love this set!",1202428800,8,715,4.511627906976744
2877640,4,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this for my son and am delighted.  It's wonderful to see some of these old classics on screen.  It's also a time capsule with narrations from different eras.  This is not a hi-tech set, but it's a great way to familiarize little ones with some great children's literature before they're able to read.",1201824000,2,309,4.581818181818182
2877641,5,B000S0GYPW,"All your school day classics bought to life on these dvds.  Certainly they are not the quality of todays animation but the stories are awesome.

My kids love them all - we have about half the DVDs on hardback books anyways - they relate well.

I find these stories a good relief from todays cartoons and other stuff.  Nice simple and meaningful.

Box set is a steal - niceley packaged.",1200096000,10,385,4.442857142857143
2877642,5,B000S0GYPW,My grandson is really enjoying this dvd set of classic children's tales. His mom has been buying and borrowing library books so that he can enjoy both reading and watching these stories. Excellent non-junky gift for a kid!,1199232000,,222,4.868421052631579
2877643,5,B000S0GYPW,"100 episodes (including other versions of same episode) say themselves. It contains various aspects of Childeren's book, but somewhat outdated graphics are the only the disadvantage to select this collection.",1198800000,2,208,5.966666666666667
2877644,5,B000S0GYPW,Wonderful collection for young children.,1436745600,,40,7.2
2877645,5,B000S0GYPW,This is a great collection of scholastic. I like having a variety to choose from and the kids love it. There is a good variety of books and the illustrations are different too. That way you aren't watching the same animation the whole time.,1435536000,,240,4.4772727272727275
2877646,5,B000S0GYPW,Love these videos of the best children's books ever!,1434067200,,52,4.888888888888889
2877647,4,B000S0GYPW,"The animated part is pretty simple, some stories are pretty old, I will say it is a 'story teller' version instead of real animation. Good for small ones to learn some stories.",1427500800,,176,4.53125
2877648,4,B000S0GYPW,"I ordered this set specifically because other reviews indicated that it included Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, which was my husband's favorite story growing up. Upon receipt, I discovered that Mike Mulligan was not part of the set. It appears that the 100 stories included in this set change. I will probably keep the set, because it includes several other favorite stories, which we would like to share with our child. However, if you are buying this set because of a particular story or stories, and particularly if you are buying it as a gift, you should allow enough time to potentially return the set and look for an individual DVD, which includes the desired story.",1423440000,,677,4.794871794871795
2877649,5,B000S0GYPW,Very good for kids,1419638400,,18,3.75
2877650,5,B000S0GYPW,"I am going to order this for my grandchildren who are not yet in school. ,y college professor shared this series with us. It provides great background knowledge on these classic books and characters. As a reading specialist, I know this is so important. I am believing this DVD series will help create a starting point for a motivation for reading and a love for books.",1403913600,,369,4.606060606060606
2877651,4,B000S0GYPW,"I originally bought these for schoolchildren to use in the classroom or library, but realized after ordering that unfortunately it is licensed for home use only. It is a great set if you plan to use it in home with your child, but educators beware! It is pricey to try and buy public performance rights for EACH story on the DVD. Too bad, isn't it? Anyway, great set!!",1395878400,,368,4.426470588235294
2877652,5,B000S0GYPW,"My 6 yr old & 1 yr old watched the Sendak disk.  My 6 yr old daughter loved it and was memorized.  The animation is very true to the book, which I prefer and enjoyed.  My favorite book growing up - Chicken Soup with Rice was animated - <swoon>  At times, the music reminded me of school house rock songs, which I also liked!

Negatives: The DVD organization is awful, but I refuse to detract stars for the fact that I received 100 books for $35 bucks (not bought on Amazon).  Each disk only lists three books, and it appears mostly organized by author and some by theme.  FYI - I had to go to options to make it read-along.  Okay, it is not books - but my daughter recognized the books I had read to her, and said her teacher had read one of the books to her.

I am looking forward to watching the other disks and will update if it does not live up to the 5 stars!",1389312000,,864,4.005847953216374
2877653,5,B000S0GYPW,"My 2.5 year old and 4.5 year old love this collection of stories.  We have many of the books, but it's fun for them to hear and see them in a different way.  Many of the stories are very well done (like Meryl Streep reading ""Chrysanthemum"").",1389052800,,241,4.217391304347826
2877654,5,B000S0GYPW,"I cannot tell you how much I love the Storybook Classics from Scholastic.  They are the same great stories you have come to love, but narrated and animated.  Your children will fall in love with the stories all over again.  Even better, many times there is author commentary.  Fantastic story lines that can be used in any educational or home setting.",1388016000,,351,4.704918032786885
2877655,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this collection with my NY City Teachers' Choice money. I have used it almost every day to deliver coherent instruction as an art teacher. Even the ones that are really old, like Sendak's ""Chicken Soup With Rice"" are worth trotting out at the right teachable moment. A few new favorites I didn't know before- Pete's a Pizza, Max's Words, and Trashy Town.  Five year olds and up love these!",1387670400,,398,4.605633802816901
2877656,5,B000S0GYPW,Classic stories that come alive with some animation. Works well with Daily 5 for Listen-to-Reading. The kids really love it.,1387065600,,124,5.25
2877657,5,B000S0GYPW,Bought it for my class and I like the animation and the words appear on the screen so builds literacy and students are engaged!,1379289600,,127,4.333333333333333
2877658,5,B000S0GYPW,My son loves it! It was his birthday present. I like the thin boxes and the description to each CD.,1376956800,,99,4.0
2877659,5,B000S0GYPW,"Many years pasted, and my little one now likes to watch them. Great videos with quality picture and sound! Bravo!",1374364800,,113,4.7
2877660,5,B000S0GYPW,"We now have both Scholastic Storybook box sets and my 4-year-old adores them. He has several favorites that he watches over and over again. Some of the stories were produced several years ago and it shows in the video quality, but my son doesn't seem to notice or care.",1372809600,,269,4.510204081632653
2877661,5,B000S0GYPW,My kids who are 17 months old and three years old love it.  They love to watch it with me so I can explain any questions from my three year old.,1365120000,,144,3.6451612903225805
2877662,5,B000S0GYPW,GREAT WILL USE FOR YEARS AND YEARS. the KIDS LOVE IT AND IS GREAT FOR BEGAINING READERS BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS.,1363651200,,113,4.428571428571429
2877663,5,B000S0GYPW,The collection is a great bargain and provides a huge range of the kids' favorites for those rainy days and quiet times.  It's a healthy alternative to commercial TV.,1362009600,,166,4.724137931034483
2877668,1,B000S0GYPW,"I thought its a 16 disc pack but I only receive 14 disc. The two missing discs are:
Disc 5: Chicka Chicka Boom Boom...and more fun with letters and numbers! (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, Five creatures, wild about books, inch by inch, blueberries for Sal, A story-a story, millions of cats) ; and
Disc 14: I Stink! ... and more stories on wheels (I Stink!, Mike. Mulligan and his Steam Shovel, Trashy Town, The Remarkable Riderless Runaway Tricycle, The Beast of Monsieur Racine, and Arnie the Doughnut
But when I emailed them, they say its a 14 disc pack

Are there many variations/packages under the same title ?",1361232000,,610,4.648148148148148
2877669,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought both sets on an impulse Gold Box special, and I really like them for my lil dude!  We have many of the books from each set, and the illustrations turned to animation are great!  They don't keep his interest as long as Toy Story or Cars (he's 2 yrs old), but I like to sit with him and watch a few stories with the accompanying book.  I think we'll get some use from these for some time!",1358553600,,395,3.9746835443037973
2877670,5,B000S0GYPW,"As a grandparent of 6 little one, we have loved this set.  I was an elementary school librarian, and this is excellent for young children.",1356998400,,138,4.52
2877671,5,B000S0GYPW,"Our boys love these storybook movies. The stories are some of the best. We bought this about 2 years ago, our boys are 5 and 7 1/2 now and they still want to watch them. Buy this set, you will not be disappointed.",1355356800,,213,3.9767441860465116
2877672,5,B000S0GYPW,My 2 year old loves watching these. She got them for her birthday February 2011 and she' s not even watched every story yet after almost a year.,1354665600,,144,4.178571428571429
2877673,3,B000S0GYPW,"It's ok.  Some of the stories are read along with the pages, some have animation, others are just a little bit creepy looking.  I think it's way overpriced. When I bought it, I got 2 sets as a lightning deal for $40.  I still think that's a wee bit much.  I have a 13 year old, 3 year old, and 18 month old.  I think the 13 year old & I watched more than the little ones.  It just doesn't seem to hold their attention the way reading to them myself does.  They'll watch a little bit and then go off and do something else.  Maybe when they're a little bit older we'll get more use out of it.  I probably would not buy the set again.  I'd rather borrow the books from the library and just read them to the kids myself.",1353715200,,716,3.944055944055944
2877674,4,B000S0GYPW,"Stories, drawings, music, and narratives are amazing! Can't go wrong with the Scholastic book series! I also own the other collection, and though some of the stories overlap, I love both collections.",1351123200,,199,5.25
2877675,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this as a gift for new parents. It took some time for their son to get to an age to enjoy this, but since then, he's loved it. Couldn't have better things to say. A great collection.",1348099200,,191,3.923076923076923
2877676,5,B000S0GYPW,This DVD Collection is great! I teach Kindergarten and many of the stories coincide with our curriculum.  The kids love them and there is a great range in lengths of time for different plans. I am glad I bought this :),1344211200,,218,4.317073170731708
2877677,4,B000S0GYPW,"Although I am very happy with the set I am so disappointed about the misleading info. One of the story's that was on my must list is ""stars stars stars"" it is listed as being on the set but I cannot find it anywhere.",1328227200,,216,3.9318181818181817
2877678,5,B000S0GYPW,"I love this collection.  The stories are based on literary classics so your child isn't watching a bunch of schmuck.  We wanted to give him DVD's that would be entertaining and help him learn and these do the trick.  Also, they aren't scary for a smaller child.  Most cartoons and Disney movies are too scary for my 2 year old. The music to Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is my favorite!  They aren't in HD, but we don't mind.",1326412800,,419,4.32051282051282
2877679,5,B000S0GYPW,"My kids love getting the Storybook Treasures from our library so when I saw this 100 story collection, I jumped on it.  They really do like this.  The amazing variety enclosed, classics from way back and newer favorites, is truly a treasure.  Some of the stories are slower, but you can skip them or just enjoy the calmer pace.  I like that it's not frenetic crazy animation, but the slow-scanning type that seems like you're actually flipping through a book.  There's some live-action stories too that are enjoyable in their own right.",1325808000,,536,4.782608695652174
2877680,5,B000S0GYPW,"The stories included in this DVD set are classics.  Had read SO many of them to my children, and currently read them to my preschool students!",1325721600,,142,4.461538461538462
2877681,1,B000S0GYPW,I bought three of these to give at Christmas.  I gave one early for a four year old's birthday. I took it in the car along with my laptop so she could watch a story on a car ride into NYC. I thought there would be animation but it was only stills with the words at the bottom.  This might be a great learning tool but it was not entertainment and I think it should be advertised as such.  I hope I can return the other two and purchase something more appropriate. (and fun).,1323129600,6,474,4.0212765957446805
2877682,4,B000S0GYPW,"This is a cute set of videos that bring many great children's books to life. Many of them are not really animated, but use the illustrations from the books and add the feel of movement using camera pans and zooms. There are multiple stories on each DVD and my kids have their favorites. This is not the same as watching a Disney animated movie in any way but they are done well enough to keep a child's attention.

I would really recommend reading as many of the books to your children as possible before allowing them the screen version. It makes them more special when they 'come to life' and it ties your reading time together with the animated version.

If you can't afford to buy all these great books, this is an alternative to at least exposing your child to so many classics.

A nice set that is well done.",1320537600,2,814,4.377483443708609
2877683,5,B000S0GYPW,"What a PHENOMENAL GIFT for a child who has EVERYTHING.  The ""Gold Box"" Deal made it an offer too good to pass up.  :)",1320364800,,117,3.8333333333333335
2877684,4,B000S0GYPW,"Was trying to decide between this and Scholastic Storybook Classics Two, but Amazon didn't include a list of titles.  Found this on the Scholastic site:

2877685,4,B000S0GYPW,"I've been more interested in watching all the videos than my 3 year old... he's stuck on ""Stinky Garbage Truck"" as he calls it. Over and over and over and over... I guess you could say that there's something for everyone. Some of the videos appear to be 60's and 70's era and some may have been produced just to hit the 100-video mark. But all are great for little ones and keep their attention for the most part.",1319587200,,413,4.2405063291139244
2877686,5,B000S0GYPW,I love the Treasury of 100 Storybook classics.  The videos are great and the set arrived much quicker than I expected.  Thanks so much!,1318636800,,135,4.583333333333333
2877687,5,B000S0GYPW,"This DVD series caught my attention when Amazon sold it as a daily special.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to buy it at a reduced price, but after seeing all the DVDs, I should have bought it sooner for the regular, retail price.  Preschool kids love the DVD set, and I love the fact that they are learning to read, coutn, and enjoy music while watching the stories.  All the stories are appropriate for preschool children, so I didn't need to pre-screen them.  The illustrations for each episode are phenomenal and the music is quite memorable.  In fact, I can't stop singing the Chicka Boom Boom song because it has such a catchy tune.  Each of the short stories only take a few minutes, and there are approximately four to five short stories to each DVD.  Thus, it is great to pop in a DVD for a short break.  At the bottom of the television screen, the words read are highlighted so that kids can begin to recognize words with their pronunciation.  This is a fabulous supplement to any preschool or home library.  I highly recommend this set to anyone with preschool-age children.",1317427200,2,1082,4.530927835051546
2877688,5,B000S0GYPW,"This is a truly wonderful animated story set.  They are some of the only things I allow my toddler to watch on video. The set is a mix of lovely classic stories, and some equally charming modern books.  Some of the older ones are done very simply (really more of a read-aloud of the story accompanied by music with the video panning over different parts of the original page drawings; simple but very nicely done) and others are tasteful animated adaptations of the original books.  All are well done, without all the hype and over-stimulation that is so common to most modern programming for children.  My two year old loves them.  You can feel as good about your child watching this as you can reading a book.  The read-along feature is great, so they're seeing the words as they watch the story just as they would in a book.  Quite a few the selections are also offered in Spanish in the bonus features section on each disc.  The music (much of it original for each story) is nicely done, classical and played by real orchestral instruments and not synthesizers, another detail I really appreciate that is hard to find.  The narrators include many well known actors, and all the narration is top notch. Buy these - you won't regret it.  And with 100 books in the set at this price, it's a steal for what you get.",1317340800,,1315,4.510548523206751

2877690,4,B000S0GYPW,"We got this set as a gift and it really is a great set for toddlers and Pre-K-1st grade.  One of our favorite books from Kinder reading (Gloria and Officer Buckle) was included.  This particular story is funny to read but it is even funnier when you see the animation.  One of our other favorites is the Dinosaur DVD, which includes How Dinosaurs Say Goodnight and other similar stories like Danny and the Dinosaur (K or first grade reader).  We choose one DVD every few days and watch it together and it entertains both my kids (ages 3 and 6).  It's wonderful when you already know the story, and sometimes it spurs interest in a book that maybe they haven't read yet but they liked the DVD so much they ask for it.  I just love it!",1312329600,,733,4.313868613138686
2877691,5,B000S0GYPW,"I am a teacher at a Goddard School. We have a smartboard, and our kids LOVE these animated storybooks. You have to be careful and make sure the story is age appropriate, but it is completely worth the money!",1299456000,,207,4.333333333333333
2877692,5,B000S0GYPW,"Love the product. My 4 year old son loves to watch these videos. He reads a lot of these books at school, so he thinks its pretty neat to see it on tv. I saw this collection on the scholastic website and thought it looked interesting, but didn't want to pay $100 dollars for it. I was so excited to find the same thing on Amazon for half the price! This collection has many stories to choose from so were not always watching the same thing.  We purchased this product so we would have other options other then the same movie over and over or a lot of the cartoons on tv that are geared towards older kids. I also plan on purchasing the 2nd collection.",1299456000,,651,4.166666666666667
2877693,5,B000S0GYPW,Purchased these for a child diagnosed with Cancer.  There are so many stories and she just LOVES them!  It's nice to listen along with the books we grew up on too!,1294617600,,163,4.225806451612903
2877694,1,B000S0GYPW,This is just the stories being read. I can do that. I thought I was buying video's of the books. Very disappointed. I might try to sell this. Definitely not worth the money.,1291248000,8,173,4.2727272727272725
2877695,5,B000S0GYPW,"I teach kindergarten and these DVDs are wonderful.  The stories keep the kids' interest and allow me to complete required testing while they're occupied.  I'd recommend them for any teacher who needs something with educational benefits to entertain students during testing time or for any busy parent who has housework to do and children to keep content.  (Please note that I'm not condoning constantly using television as a babysitter, but sometimes you have to and this is better than violent cartoons any day!)",1291161600,,513,5.156626506024097
2877696,5,B000S0GYPW,"This series of disks are wonderful and they really are classics, not cheaply made.
My grandchildren love them and now know so many of the stories that I read to my own children.",1289952000,,177,4.393939393939394
2877697,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter wondering if she was already too old for it, but to my relief, most of the selections are interesting and fun enough to keep her watching. There are some excellent, sweet little films here, and some quirky, but all are suitable for children, and I would highly recommend this to homeschooling families. A great activity would be to find the books for each DVD before watching, and turn the pages along with the action on the screen. As a former homeschooling mom, I'm sorry I didn't know about this sooner.",1287446400,,545,4.515151515151516
2877708,2,B000S0GYPW,"Overall, not quite as good as I had hoped. My son (3) has always loved reading stories together; regrettably he doesn't much care for this dvd collection. There certainly are a lot of stories in this collection.... just not a lot of good stories. Less than 20% of the stories consistently hold his attention for the whole feature when we watch them together.  I picked these up for my son when the item was on sale - (paid roughly 40 cents per story)- I would not recommend paying much more than that for the collection.",1285545600,3,520,4.473684210526316
2877709,5,B000S0GYPW,Bought this for my 6 year old and she loves it! Easy to follow and entertaining. You can tell the video are the old charicatures and somewhat dated but the storylines are the same. My daughter loves to watch the stories and especially read along now that she can read. Very rewarding for her. I highly recommend it.,1285200000,,315,4.448275862068965
2877710,5,B000S0GYPW,"We haven't even watched all of them yet, but these have become my 2 1/2 year old daughter's favorite pick at bedtime. I love that we could watch a whole movie or limit the TV time to a single story. Since they are all favorite children's literature books, we are never disappointed. Well done, great buy!",1285113600,,304,4.446428571428571
2877711,4,B000S0GYPW,Nicely done stories that are similar to 'Reading Rainbow's' telling of the stories.  A great value for anyone with children.,1285027200,,124,5.2
2877712,1,B000S0GYPW,These video's were very boring for my 2 1/2 year old. I didn't realize it was just still shots of pictures. Would love to sell this and get some of my money back.,1284854400,10,162,3.9393939393939394
2877713,5,B000S0GYPW,"The storybook classics have 100 stories with DVD's. It is a
must-have for children. The books on the DVD's are the same
ones read at school. The children love them, and the words at
the bottom of the DVD's help them to learn words...excellent
reinforce skills that are extremely enjoyable.  This is an
excellent product for children ages 5-8!!!!!",1284681600,,346,4.864406779661017
2877714,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought these dvds as a Christmas gift for a nephew.  I think he is going to love them.  A lot of the classics my own children loved when they were young are included in this set, and I'm sure the next generation will enjoy them just as much.",1284681600,,243,3.938775510204082
2877715,5,B000S0GYPW,This is a great gift for a child or grandchild.  It's the next-best thing to being read-to.  It includes real classic and soon to be classic children's books.

2877716,5,B000S0GYPW,"My sister-in-law alerted me to a special sale on this collection; I am so glad I made the purchase!  They are well produced, and they use the original art from the story books.  It made no difference to me that they were narrated by ""stars"", but it was fun to try to identify the voices.  These video stories have captivated my seven-year-old grandson, to the point that it's all he would watch on our vacation this summer.  And that's a far cry from the video games he prefers.  I would heartily recommend them--for adults as well as the kids.  I enjoy them myself and look forward to spending time with all my grandchildren and these timeless stories.",1284681600,,653,4.538461538461538
2877717,5,B000S0GYPW,"I purchased this set as an alternative to the Barney and Blue's Clues DVDs.  I had hoped our two-year-old would like them, but I have been surprised by how excited she has been to watch them.  She seems to like them all, with the added excitement of being able to open a new one every once in a while.  Great travel companion in the car DVD player.  The narration is a little dry for Mom & Dad to listen to, but maybe our daughter will switch to headphones soon.",1284422400,,462,4.157303370786517
2877728,5,B000S0GYPW,My 6 year old gets easily frustrated reading and learning new words.  She is also a TV junkie and would rather watch TV than read any day.  I pop these in and she really enjoys them as does my 3 year old.  My husband was even impressed which is hard to do.  I highley recommend these.  We love Scholastic!,1282867200,,305,4.101694915254237
2877729,5,B000S0GYPW,"Beautifully put together, engaging, appropriately thought provoking for anyone who thinks from ages 3 to 83.  I purchased this as a gift for a dear friend who runs a first rate pre-school and she was thrilled.  The child in me almost hated to part with it myself and though I'm not 80 I'm closer to that than 8.  Thank you Amazon for providing such high quality materials like these at great, great prices.",1282608000,3,406,4.534246575342466
2877730,5,B000S0GYPW,"I was skeptical about how the animated versions would measure up to the original print versions of the stories. I was amazed to see that the words and pictures are pretty much identical. Not sure how they do this exactly, but it's as if the books have come to life.

Of course, watching a video is not a replacement for good, old-fashioned story time. However, I feel like this is a great option for those times when my kids do watch television. They are just nice, wholesome stories. I also think the animated versions can be a good way to enhance comprehension of a story, especially when you pair it with a reading and discussion of the printed version.

2877732,5,B000S0GYPW,There are so many great storied on this collection.  I remember many of them from when I was little.  I really like that the narration follows the books exactly so that children can follow along or resite along with it if they are familiar with a particular story.

2877734,4,B000S0GYPW,Don't expect Disney quality but they are all 70's type PBS quality at least.  Loads of fun for a 4 year old.  Just sorting and choosing from the many disks is fun enough.,1271894400,17,170,4.121212121212121

2877736,5,B000S0GYPW,"This is a wonderful collection of animated storybooks. These are classic books made for the tv. The stories aren't changed like when a book is made into a movie, these are the books with the same illustrations and storyline, just animated. It's great to have your child watch these with the read along option, especially after they've read the real book. A great way for children to learn to love literature and love to read!",1268438400,,425,4.68
2877737,5,B000S0GYPW,This collection contains so many stories that your child could be kept busy for days.  There are a ton of good stories (and couple of not-so-good ones) that you'll remember from when you were a kid. The purchase was definitely worth the money.,1268092800,,243,4.651162790697675

2877739,5,B000S0GYPW,My four year old son really enjoys this set.  There is a great variety of stories to choose from.  The animation is simple- not too busy and overstimulating- but engaging. The stories are classic.  I am a teacher as well and many of my colleagues have borrowed dvds from this set.  We are very satisfied with this purchase!,1265587200,,323,4.517241379310345
2877740,5,B000S0GYPW,"I got this for niece/nephew @ Christmas. One of the tapes was broken - Amazon replaced ASAP - the kids were back to watching them all the time.

2877742,5,B000S0GYPW,"Scholastic's collection of 100 Storybook Classics is like no other DVD set we've ever owned. Crammed full of animated renditions of well-loved modern children's classics and a wide range of animation styles that match the feel of the original picture-books, there's no better bang for your DVD dollar.

Parents will be thrilled to find well-respected works of literature that have endured the test of time ' Robert McCloskey's Make Way for Ducklings, Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, and H.A. Rey's Curious George Rides a Bike are only a very small sampling of well-loved tales that are found in this collection.

Newer inclusions in the set include Chicka Chicka Boom Boom by Bill Martin Jr., Max's Words by Kate Banks (a new family treasure), andDiary of a Spider by Doreen Cronin. This is such an eclectic collection of animated stories that there is something here for everyone. Animation ranges from pans over the original picture book pages in The Five Chinese Brothers by Clare Huchet Bishop, to full-blown modern animation in Harold and the Purple Crayon by Crockett Johnson, to live-action shorts in Frog Goes to Dinner based on Mercer Mayer's book of the same title. Likewise the production age of the shorts range from the '70s through to recent years.

Divided into sixteen separate DVDs, each represents a thematic collection of stories. For example, the Diary of a Spider DVD also includes other 'critter stories', one about a mouse, another about a 'tadpole', one about a frog, and the other, a termite. Other DVDs include the work of specific authors, the Where the Wild Things AreDVD includes six animated shorts from Maurice Mendak, and the Ezra Jack Keats Collection includes seven stories from ' you guessed it- Ezra Jack Keats.

Each DVD features four featured titles that play with optional 'read-along' text that displays along the bottom of the screen and changes color as each word is narrated. As a bonus, two to three additional animated shorts are included that don't have the 'read-along' feature. The stories that are the most well known also feature foreign-language narrations and 'read-along' text in the target language. Some of the titles include Spanish versions of Make Way for Ducklings, The Snowy Day, Where the Wild Things Are (also available in French), Click, Clack, Moo and more.

Professional narrations are provided by a huge array of voice artists, some notables include: James Earl Jones, Patrick Stewart, Meryl Streep, Pete Seeger, Sarah Jessica Parker, and many others. The stories are wonderfully read, with great matches between the narrators and the stories they've been assigned.

With over 19 hours of viewing, and 100 'picture book inspired' animations included in this sixteen-disc set, you just can't go wrong! Of course there will be some that aren't your favorites; for instance, I'm not a fan of Maurice Sendak, and the jiggly little-boy-bits of In the Night Kitchen have turned me off of that DVD. On the other hand, there are absolutely wonderful new treasures that we've discovered -Chrysanthemum by Kevin Henkes, and The Foolish Frog by Pete Seeger, are great additions to our digital library.

A very handy guide for checking off which Scholastic Storybook Treasures DVDs you own in your collection is included, along with a small activity book that corresponds with several of the stories in the DVD collection.

I've never seen such a comprehensive collection of animated storybooks, and I highly recommend it ' the cost is less than $1 per animated story, and these treasures will be enjoyed for your children for many years to come.

2877743,2,B000S0GYPW,"I was excited to get this collection of videos to use with my class in Kindergarten.  However, It does include quite a few that I will not choose to use, and the sound quality is poor for some reason. I would not purchase it again in this package if I were to do it over.",1258416000,4,271,3.9272727272727272
2877744,5,B000S0GYPW,"My 5 year old daughter and I love this! It's the classics on video with the actual pages from the book being read. She recognizes some of the stories from having ""read"" them before. It's fun and entertaining and I don't feel bad at all putting in a disc for her to watch while I clean and cook. I'd recommend it to anyone that if a fan of scholastic books. It's great!",1258416000,,368,4.125
2877745,5,B000S0GYPW,I bough this for my three grand daughters. My daughter says they love the Scholastic Storybook Collection. I was told it was the perfect Christmas gift.,1258416000,,152,4.884615384615385
2877746,5,B000S0GYPW,My 20mo. old niece is mesmerized with the stories and prefect representation of the illustrations that are true to the original books.,1258416000,,134,5.136363636363637
2877747,5,B000S0GYPW,"The Scholastic Video Collection is for a Christmas gift for my grandson who is
nearly 4 years old.  I think he will enjoy it very much",1258416000,,134,4.153846153846154
2877748,5,B000S0GYPW,"In a Nick Jr./ Disney world where all the characters seem to shout, the music is often too loud and incomprehensible and the storylines are--- Wait!  are there storylines?? (Wow, Wow Wubbzy comes to mind!)-- We have discovered this wonderful set of stories thoughtfully put together in a lovely, QUIET form of entertainment for our daughter.  Although the animation quality is spotty throughout, overall the artistry of the original books shines through and the narrators provide a wonderful ""voice"" to these favorite books.  Our favorite is the Chrysanthemum DVD.  We've now worked through not just the videos but every book written by Kevin Henkes!",1257897600,,650,5.221153846153846
2877749,5,B000S0GYPW,"Bought this for my older daughters children: 7, 4, 3, and 1.5.  All reports are that ALL of them love the DVDs and the stories, from the old familiar ones to the newly discovered.  Picture quality is very good and packaging very nice.  Seems like with the appeal to such a wide variety of ages (and sexes - 2 girls, 2 boys) that these DVDs will be around and in use for a long time, making for a good value for our increasingly hard earned money ! Recommended.",1256860800,,460,4.204545454545454
2877750,5,B000S0GYPW,"I received this Scholastic DVD set yesterday, and it is the BEST purchase I have ever made from Amazon. They had sent an email informing me that it was on sale for $50 off the regular price so I paid $3 EACH for the 16 DVDs. No need for your child to get bored with this selection of 100 stories (they count some ""repeat"" stories done in Spanish).
The stories are grouped either by author or subject with a wide range of writing styles and beautiful art illustrations to expose your child to an unique learning experience. I recommend that you print off the list of stories that a previous reviewer wrote, and take it with you when you go to the library or shop for a new book for your child or grandchild. It's important to not just rely on the dvds, but to have your child READ the book too. Try to set a long term goal of having your child READ each of the stories, and check them off your list. Or at the very least pick your favorites and read them. It is doable, just realize it will take some time. Believe me, it will be an rewarding experience for your child and you to share, and it's one way to raise a well educated, well read child.
My absolute favorites in this collection are:
""Good Night, Gorilla"" and other bedtime stories. (Very calming, and relaxing. ""Good Night, Gorilla"" will win your heart while you will get a chuckle out of ""How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?"")
""Chrysanthemum"" and more Kevin Henkes stories
""Strega Nona"" and more Caldecott Award winning folk tales. (All of these stories provide a good moral, but we particularly loved ""Joseph Had a Little Overcoat"".)
""Is Your Mama a Llama?"" and more stories about growing up
""Click, Clack, Moo..Cows That Type"" and more stories on the farm (very humorous)
*It's nice that they include stories from different cultures, and ethic backgroungs. Check out ""Flossie and the Fox"" from ""Curious George Rides a Bike"" and other tales of mischief.
ENJOY!",1255651200,,1917,4.543352601156069
2877751,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this set for my girls (two and five) about a year ago, and they still use it pretty much every day.  (And yes, I still read to them.)  I buy all the big animated movies, and they still come back to these.  16 discs give them plenty of variety, and there's not a bad one in the bunch.  I've never been happier with a purchase.

One side benefit - my oldest actually recognized Carole King (this set includes 4 songs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Really-Rosie/dp/B0001N1OW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Really Rosie</a>) when she came on the radio.",1255651200,,603,5.440860215053763
2877752,5,B000S0GYPW,I bought this for my step-mother who's a teacher and she says her kids love this. Also my neice really loves them too. A great product to have out there.,1255478400,,153,4.133333333333334
2877753,5,B000S0GYPW,"I try to limit TV watching as much as possible, but these stories have become staples in our house. They're great for several reasons:

1. The videos are drawn from good books, so the stories are all good
2. Most of the animation is not too busy -- simple and traditional
3. A lot of the music is really good. Just the Antarctica story alone has about 10 great songs that my kid loves to sing
4. Each disk has bonus stories that are often as good (or better) than the headliners
5. The stories are short, and so are perfect for limited-time wind-downs

I have been impressed with the consistent quality of the set. Each disk has a different theme, but I have been very happy with all of them.",1253664000,,692,4.2748091603053435
2877754,5,B000S0GYPW,These DVDs of the best stories are great. My son LOVES them. He especially loves the old lady who swallowed a fly. Great for any kid!,1253318400,,133,4.153846153846154
2877755,4,B000S0GYPW,I have an autistic son who is not able to read yet. All of my children enjoy watching and reading along with the video. This is a must have for mothers of young and old children.,1252800000,,178,3.9722222222222223
2877756,5,B000S0GYPW,Awesome books on DVD for my kids.  What a better way to have them appreciate the old school scholastic books.,1247616000,,109,4.45
2877757,3,B000S0GYPW,"I thought this set was a great concept. It comes well packaged and each of the main books included covers one of the DVD pages. When I list the names below, the stories on the cover will be labled with an ""*"" ...

I was disappointed by the organization. Yes. The stories artre all clearly listed on the box in alphabetical order, but they're hard to find on the DVDs because they're not organized in any particular way per DVD set.

For example. I LOVE Courduroy. They probably could have included the live action movie along with the two cartoon versions that more closely resemble the books. Instead.. they put a book called ""Yo! Yes?"" on the DVD... That starts out with two kids throwing a ball back and forth saying and one saying ""You? ... .... .... "" pointing to himself and tossing the ball and the other one responding ""You? ... ... ...."" ...... hmmmm... not so educational. Not so interesting. Kind of a waste of space on the DVD. This particular DVD also has ""Here Comes the Cat!"" -- which I had never heard of.

While skimming the DVDS, I thought I was getting jipped. 3-4 stories on each of the 16 DVDs doesn't really come up to 100. Thats when I noticed they were counting sories they put in the DVD features as a special. I thought the features area was supposed to be for author comentaries... actual extras.. ?? Then.. The best part of this is that you actually only get 90 stories. 10 are also available in Spanish. If you're not learning spanish.. Given that most DVDs currently come in English and Spanish--- This was a little disappointing. AND misleading. I think that's why I couldn't find a list of stories included ANYWHERE.

The ""read along"" is really just captions. You can turn them on yourself.

You can't skip their advertisement for the DVD set you already own. You can fast forward... but strangly, you are then able to forward past the main menu and end up watching something aweful.

That being said.. there are a few good ones on here. I haven't really decided if it was worth buying as a set or if I should have purchased each one individually. I spent $50. I'm seeing some of the individuals selling used for as low as $1. (I don't think I'd spend much more than $3 on each one as an individual). Resale value is low....

Key to my list:
Here's the list (And again.. astericks mark the ones that are on the cover). (Sp) means that it is also in Spanish. I have gone ahead and numbered them Sp-10 accordingly.

2877758,3,B000S0GYPW,"I do like this set, especially getting it a great price!  But I was a tad disappointed because the quality just seems like it belongs in the 1980's.  That is, with so many technological advances, I'm sure that a new set can be presented by scholastic taking advantage of more animation, more color, and more spark.  I think they're good, but that they need a complete make-over.  Still, I rate it three stars because I love all of these stories.  I'm a mommy of two and an early childhood education teacher.  I think the quality of the video/DVD quality does not do complete justice to the actual marvelous, award-winning books.  Maybe other people actually like the fact that the books on film stay true to the story and are not overdone with special effects.  But I kinda would've liked more.  I showed the DVD's to my children in class and many lost interest.  I think they like it better when I read the story to them than watching some of the stories on the DVD.  I think it's because, eved though they don't realize it, they realize that it's a bit outdated.",1245456000,3,1064,4.489583333333333
2877759,4,B000S0GYPW,I bought this for 5 grandchildren and the toddlers loved it.  I think the parents liked it more. It is like reading the stories to the kids and they can follow along if they have their own copy of the book (or from the library).  It is the original art work with the narration and words so it is nice for early readers.,1241827200,,319,4.0476190476190474
2877760,5,B000S0GYPW,I think I enjoyed these more than the kids.  It was fun to see the books I read as a kid put into video form.  I like that they use the original illustrations.  Cheaper than buying the books.  You don't miss out on the reading b/c they go slow enough for the kids to follow along.,1241654400,,280,3.9464285714285716
2877761,5,B000S0GYPW,"As expected, this set was extremely well received by our 5 and 2 year old grandaughters. There were several unexpected surprises in the titles....",1241222400,,146,5.125
2877762,5,B000S0GYPW,"Bought this set of classics on some special Amazon promotion and my kids love them.  The quality of some is a little dated, but they're classics and they're certainly not any worse than the originals.  Definitely recommended for everyone with kids - and maybe even those of you with a little kid inside.",1241136000,,303,4.69811320754717
2877763,4,B000S0GYPW,"This collection of DVDs translate some much beloved children's books into video.  Scholastic did an amazing job here, and the stories are faithful to the original books, and yet they add an additional dimension to the story with animation and audio.

A lot of children's videos are lacking in quality.

My 4 year-old daughter enjoys them very much and I recommend this to parents.",1240704000,,380,4.90625
2877764,5,B000S0GYPW,"I didn't buy the entire set all at once - I've been buying the DVD's one by one or in sets of three.  Our local library has most of them and I borrow them from the library and then buy the ones that I know we'll watch over and over.  It was a good way to test drive the DVD's before I commit to them.  As a mom who monitors TV content closely and limits the time spent watching TV, I find that these are quality videos.  Usually we have read the print version of these books, but he has taken to a number of stories that we haven't read yet.  I have found that he will ask for some stories over and over, and will even ""talk"" about them or tell me the story after watching the DVD. He just turned 2yrs so I am very excited about encouraging his language development as much as I can.

We have sat down with the print version while the DVD is playing - it doesn't work so well for him right now.  He'd rather watch the animation then look at the static picture and words.  But my guess is that once he gets to reading age, he'll be able to follow the words in the book and work on his reading skills.  We already talk about the videos (who was in the story?  what did they do?  where were they going?) - so I find that they are great educational tool in that respect.

As far as price - I think buying the entire set at the price Amazon lists is a pretty fair price.  I'm finding small 3 DVD sets or single DVDs at local discount stores or at bookstores.  I've found 3 DVD set for $6/set.  I've found single DVD's for $5.  I also really like some of the bonus stories.  In total I think I now have 11 Scholastic DVDs.

Another thing I found in buying the single DVD's - there is an old and new version for the Scholastic videos.  Some of the stories are grouped differently on the DVDs depending on if you are buying the old or new versions.  Just an FYI if you get used to a particular grouping of stories.",1240617600,3,1906,4.005305039787799
2877765,5,B000S0GYPW,"We purchased this for our kids for Christmas 2008 and it has been a big hit with them (and us). We have read most of the books already and it was fun to see them animated. This box set was a special buy around Christmas and a very good deal - but even at full price you get a huge number of great animated stories which are clean and (often) familiar.

The picture quality ranges from great to 'ok' - but some of the stories have videos which are quite old.",1240617600,,457,4.021978021978022
2877766,4,B000S0GYPW,"Great stories, the kids love them.  Wish they were combined on less CD's as they are short stories.  That's my only complaint.  A wonderful series for kids.",1240531200,,156,4.703703703703703
2877767,4,B000S0GYPW,"These stories are cute, but have not held the attention of my 2 year old the way animated movies such as Monsters Inc., Toy Story, or Wall-e do",1240444800,,143,4.142857142857143
2877768,4,B000S0GYPW,"I have a 3 1/2 year old boy and a 1 1/2 year old girl and they both love the videos in the set.  If you're expecting Disney, buy a Disney video which are great in their own regard.  These take the stories and the images from the books and build upon them so it's like expanding on the visual experience from the books.

Both of my kids LOVE books and reading and staring at the images.  These videos captured that experience for times when reading isn't practical.",1240099200,,464,4.238636363636363
2877769,5,B000S0GYPW,"I purchased this to use in my 1st grade classroom.  What a great buy this was!  It has videos of the most popular children's books of all time!  My students love to watch these videos.  I like to show these after lunch and its a great way to get my class to settle down before we continue with our work for the day.  I like to show these after reading the book to my class and then we do a compare and contrast activity.  I am very pleased with this product and if you are a teacher in the primary grades or a parent with a young child, then you'll love it too!",1240012800,,561,3.920353982300885
2877770,5,B000S0GYPW,"Bought this for my niece even though I thought it was a bit young for her. My mother watched a couple of the stories and decided this was the perfect thing to have around for a grandmother. When she brought it home she tested it on my niece (aged 10) and her friend and it kept them busy for the better part of 2 hours!!! They knew most of the stories and were intrigued with the animation of the illustrations. Would recommend this for any grandmother who has a lot of kids around and even for any daycare. If they are going to watch TV at least there are morals, songs and decent family entertainment in each and every dvd.",1239408000,,625,4.216666666666667
2877771,5,B000S0GYPW,"These are a wonderful addition to a library of storybook classics.  I purchased this video collection for my daughter who is a first grade
teacher.  She has many of these classics in book form and loves the
concept that her students can see the characters they love come to life
with this collection.  Great classics at a great price!",1239408000,,334,4.627118644067797
2877772,5,B000S0GYPW,"We haven't looked at all of them yet but the ones we saw are well done and hold the interest of the grandchildren. I especially like that the words are ""tracked"" as the DVD plays.",1239148800,,179,4.142857142857143
2877773,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this set for my grandchildren, ages 6 and 7.  I wasn't sure if they would be too old for it or not, but they absolutely love reading along with the video.  When they are done with all of the videos, I will pass it on to my other grandchildren, ages 3 and 4!",1239148800,,266,3.8181818181818183
2877774,5,B000S0GYPW,"I purchased this collection for my two boys ages 4 and 8 because it was on sale. I was afraid that they wouldn't be too excited about it because they are into all the 3D and digital animation type movies.  But, boy was I wrong!  They were delighted to see all the movies of the timeless classics that we have read to them over the years.  I have to admit that I even have fun watching them as I grew up reading many of the stories included in the collection.  My son has even taken some of the videos to share with his 2nd grade class as they have read many of the stories in class that are a part of the collection.  The teacher loves it!  Definitely worth the money in my opinion.",1239148800,,682,4.052238805970149
2877775,4,B000S0GYPW,"Well done!  Of course, there were some embarrasing moments on ""In the Night Kitchen"" where the kids giggle uncontrollable because the little boy's clothes came off.  I tried to fast forward but it occurred a few times throughout the story.  I don't remember seeing illustrations of that in the book; did I miss it?",1239148800,,314,4.777777777777778
2877776,5,B000S0GYPW,These CDs are keeping my Grandson enthralled from start to finish. They are his *treat* after a good day and even at 17 months he is enjoying  so much pleasure from them.,1239148800,,170,4.3125
2877777,5,B000S0GYPW,"My nephews love these DVD's.  They watch them over and over.  The stories are diverse, well-illustrated, and most have engaging music.  The only disappointment for my older nephew was that the Curious George story featured an older version of the story versus the ""new"" monkey character currently seen on PBS.  One thing to keep in mind when purchasing these dvd's are that if your child currently enjoys Star Wars, Spiderman, etc. he/she may find these stories a little boring, as the pacing is much slower than alot of what is currently on television for kids.  My nephews really enjoy the scholastic stories at the ages of 2 and 4 but they are not allowed to watch most regular childrens television shows or cartoons.",1239062400,,720,4.821138211382114
2877778,5,B000S0GYPW,"Scholastic's Treasury of 100 Storybook Classics is very appropriately named. Many of these titles are those that every child should hear before starting kindergarten and these are faithfully and expertly-rendered by the Weston Woods Studios with wonderful narrators and music. Indeed these are the videos librarians have been showing at story hours for years.  While they don't make up for a good lap-sit or bedtime story hour with your child (a TV doesn't cuddle or hug or stop to exclaim or explain something on a page), they are perfect companions for sharing the best children's literature with your children while you are preparing dinner or driving the car!

2877779,5,B000S0GYPW,My 4 year old watches these over and over.  He seems to like these more than his Thomas the Tank engine videos. It is very educational at an economical price.,1239062400,,158,4.266666666666667
2877780,5,B000S0GYPW,My 7 grandchildren (ages 1-7) love the videos.  One has watched Dirty Dog at least 5 times.  Each have their favorites.  Fortunately there are enough in the collection to keep them in good stories for a while.  Many they have already read but delight in seeing the video.  I like to words at the bottom because it reinforces their reading.,1239062400,,339,4.583333333333333
2877781,5,B000S0GYPW,"I received an e-mail about the Scholastic DVD's. I am a retired teacher of 34 years who has been doing some long term substitute work in the lower grades. I also have 7 grandchildren and this caught my eye. I ordered it and I can't praise it enough. During my teaching career, we would order Scholastic Books every month. I was familiar with many of the titles on the DVD's. They are great. Not too long, they are perfect for rainy day recesses or just an end of the day treat while waiting for buses. How many times have the children commented that the library has that book. Here they can see the little ""movie"" about the book. Great buy.",1239062400,,640,4.341666666666667
2877782,5,B000S0GYPW,"I purchased this for my grandkids, ages 4 and almost 2.  They love these stories/videos.  We watch a new one every week or so.  They are entranced with Strega Nona and insist on seeing it at least two times a day.  The video prompted me to purchase all the books about Strega Nona.  This is a GREAT purchase for all grandparents.",1239062400,,329,4.327868852459017

2877785,5,B000S0GYPW,"I bought this set for my 3 and 4 year old daughters.  Many of the books we have read over and over again so it was fun for them to see these books ""come to life.""  There is quite a variety of productions in this collection from very simple animation to actual reproductions of stories using live actors and actresses in short films.  I would never substitute these for the rewards of curling up with your child and a classic book but these videos are well done and much classier than most of the DVDs marketed to children these days.

My 2-year knows the book ""Goodnight Gorilla,"" so she paid close attention to the video. But she's not really into anything on TV unless it's Elmo OR something she's already familiar with. So we'll continue to read with her, sometimes choosing from stories that appear in this video collection.

2877791,5,B000S0GYPW,"My 5 year old son, got bored from them quickly. Although, he initialy liked them a lot. He would rather hold the book in his hand and read it by himself. My 3 year old can't get enough of the DVDs. Its like having someone read the book 24 hours to him. He loves holding his book and following the events on the DVD. The quality, sound, images are excellent. One bad point is that the DVD's are thin and not sturdy: my son broke one already while getting it out the case.",1239062400,,470,4.064516129032258

2877795,5,B000S0GYPW,Let's be honest here. You're like me. I bought this to keep my 2 year old quiet and still. It works. The best part is that there are 100 stories so parents won't get bored watching the same story over and over.,1238716800,,210,4.023809523809524

I was worried that because she was accustomed to the Disney animation that these would bore her, but she actually requests to watch them now. They are classic stories and I like that she can hear and see 100 different story books although we don't own all of those stories in book format. These videos/dvds also give me different ideas about how to read her the books that we do have, especially ""The old lady who swallowed a fly"" and ""Chicka chicka boom boom"". They are told in a sing-song way that is very entertaining.",1238630400,,682,4.5
2877797,5,B000S0GYPW,"My son and I watch these over and over and discuss the stories, characters, and meanings, as well as the differences in the art work. He is 5 and has an amazing vocabulary due to my husband and I reading to him daily(not just at bedtime) since birth, as well as him listening to us converse over the years. We also spoke to him as we do each other since he was very little, and I got into a habit early on of introducing a new word to him daily with its meaning and examples of its meaning. These ""stories come to life"" present many opportunities for learning, and I enjoy them as much as he does!! Learning can happen under any circumstance. I read a very negative review which frankly, I was shocked about, that said it is just another way parents can shirk the responsibility of interacting with their child. Well sure, if that is what you CHOOSE to do, however, this collection was not designed with that intention at all. It is a wonderful springboard to inspire the imagination! Books should always be the first choice, but I see this as a lovely supplement to inspiring a child's imagination, introduce him/her to other cultures, and expand their vocabulary, as well as nurture a love of different art styles. I plan on buying collections for all my friends' kiddos as soon as I can afford it!!",1238025600,,1301,4.470588235294118
2877798,5,B000S0GYPW,"What a great collection, I was really worried it was going to be a camera on a page with an occasional wiggle, I don't know how else to explain that but anyways the way that they turned the book into a show is really amazing and makes it special.  When my daughter sees a story that we have read a hundred times bouncing on the screen she gets all excited.

I would highly recommend -- oh also each disk is about 60 minutes with a few 30 minute ones and they all have a play all feature so you don't have to constantly push play after each story.",1236902400,,546,4.046296296296297
2877799,5,B000S0GYPW,"This is a wonderful set of DVDs with favorite, quality stories put to life. I agree that you do need to read to your children. This should not replace that, but these are wonderful for times like car rides - long OR short. I was very curious what other titles were in the set that are not listed in the description.

Here are the other titles in this set that are not listed in the description: The Nutshell Kids; In the Night Kitchen; Getting to know Maurice Sendak; Officer Buckle and Gloria; Angus and the Ducks; The Beast of Monsieur Racine; 14 Rats and a Rat-Catcher; John Brown, Rose, and the Midnight Cat; How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?; Happy Birthday Moon; The Napping House; The Paperboy; Patrick; The Hat; The Great White Man-Eating Shark; Flossie and the Fox; The Happy Lion; Cat and Canary; Owen; A Weekend with Wendell; Picnic; Monty; The Wizard; Trashy Town; Rosie's Walk; The Caterpillar and the Pollywog; The Foolish Frog; Joey Runs Away; Changes, Changes; A Picture for Harold's Room; Harold's Fairy Tale; The Mysterious Tadpole; Drummer Hoff; Smile for Auntie; The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash; The Pigs' Wedding; The Cow Who Fell in the Canal; Charlie Needs a Cloak; Antarctic Antics; Musical Max; Keeping House; Waiting for Wings; Blueberries for Sal; Time of Wonder; Burt Dow: Deep Water Man; Lentil; Yo!

DVDs range in times of 35 min. - 63 min each. Most are in the 50 - 60 min. range. There are 8 stories also in Spanish version. Another great feature is the read-along - what a great way to reinforce reading skills!

Most of the titles are some of the best known children's books while there are some little known titles as well which I think is wonderful. As an early-childhood teacher I would say 20 percent of the titles I have never heard of.

I am very pleased with my purchase. I had some doubt and considered this a risky purchase, but it is better than I hoped for.",1236902400,3,2393,4.636792452830188
2877800,4,B000S0GYPW,"Okay, I'm going to get the complaints out of the way first.

As far as I can tell there is no way to skip the commercial advertising the Scholastic Video Collection at the beginning of the dvd. Thanks, Scholastic, We bought a huge set of them already we don't need to sit through an ad for the series every time we put one on. Bleh.

Some of the stories are a bit busy for my taste. Now, I have a very young child, so maybe when my kid is a bit older I won't mind as much, but for now we aren't going to be showing him a couple of the dvds. That's fine because he isn't in the age range for the ""busy"" ones yet, so perhaps I shouldn't complain about this but I thought it was worth mentioning.

It's super annoying that there wasn't a complete list of titles, so I have uploaded one to the pictures section for people to look at before taking the plunge. Note that 10 of the 100 are just Spanish versions of stories already on the dvds. I find it kind of disingenuous to advertise a collection as having 100 titles when it really has 90 +10 done over with a different language track.

Now that I've moaned about the things that I don't like, I'll sing the praises of this collection.

My child does not live in a bubble, and although I don't use tv as a babysitter there are times when a little tv is inevitable. I would far rather toss one of these on than have a random, jarring tv show. It's nice to know that he can watch a gentle, non-busy dvd like this and then we can sit down and read the book together. It's also a collection that he is going to grow into, as he's too young for most of the collection right now. I like having the option of something like this, The best of the collection that I have watched so far is the Good Night Gorilla collection (also containing How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight, Happy Birthday Moon, The Napping House, The Paperboy, Patrick, and The Hat). It is really lovely and gentle, a great way to help wind a kid down at night before starting the normal bedtime routine that includes ""real"" reading.

I really like how long lived this collection is. There are things on here that a 9 year old would happily sit down and watch, and stories that are appropriate for my toddler. So really there is a lot of value and a good selection for kids of different ages.

It is also nice that each dvd has a bit of a theme, bedtime stories, slightly scary stories, stories from Africa, Caldecott Award-winning folk tales, stories that sing, tales of mischief, learning fun, stories about growing up, etcetera. It makes it easy to grab the right collection for the ""mood"" of the moment.

This is a real treasure of a collection, and while the annoyances are enough for me to knock off half a star, it would be a pretty priceless addition to the video collection of the young child(ren) in your life. Of course it shouldn't replace reading to your child, but any good parent doesn't need to be told that in an Amazon review! Get this if you're like me and want the option of something a bit more gentle than what you'll typically find on kids tv or if you want to help foster a child's love of reading. This set plus a few of the books in the collection (if the intended child doesn't already have them!) would make a really lovely gift. Watch one, then sit down and read the book together. Or the other way around! Turn on the subtitles and have the child follow along with her own copy. There are lots of options here if you don't want to just use it as a typical dvd. The fact that you can go and buy every one of the books makes this collection very versatile.",1236729600,46,3588,4.243045387994144
2877801,1,B000S0GYPW,"At first, it seemed as if this was a wonderful collection of stories for children, stories that parents might read with their children. That there might be a time before i-pods and i-phones and game-boys and other electronic distractions. That there might be an opportunity to share learning, and wonder, and discovery in those first few years together. But no; it's just another passive device to cram into a machine and distract the children with noise and pictures. No opportunity to learn, to share, to grow - just sit there kid and stay out of the way - mom and dad have more important things to do  Let the television distract you for a while.

2877820,5,B000S0GYPW,"Here is a list I've compiled of all the wonderful stories included in this selection. The Halloween disc is missing because I threw it out (my family is not into Halloween and witches and so forth, so we never viewed it). Other than that, all the titles are listed, I believe.

First, you'll find the title of the disc. Then, the selections featured on the disc are numbered, and the author(s) is listed. Most of the discs have 6 featured stories. If something is listed as ""Eng/Sp,"" then the story is presented in both languages, and each language presentation counts as one separate presentation on the disc.

I compiled this list for myself so that I could take it to the bookstore with me... I thought it might be helpful for those doing the same, or considering purchase of this DVD collection. My kids love it already, especially Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Happy viewing! :)

2877822,5,B000S0GYPW,"We are very pleased with this set.  The titles are both familiar--like ones from Ezra Jack Keats and Robert McCloskey--and new.  But the DVDs are all well-done, with excellent music and voice-overs.  Some of them, particularly the Antarctic Antics, are hilarious.  Some are winsome.  None, to quote Chrysanthemum's father, are jaundiced.  Our toddler is afraid of _Where the Wild Things Are_ and loves _Chrysanthemum_.  We love Ezra Jack Keats' works, and the extra interview with him is fantastic.  Overall, for about $45, I think that this set is a steal.  The local library uses individual DVDs from this series for movie night!

If I had to pick one favorite out of this whole set, it would be Meryl Streep reading _Chrysanthemum_.  She is absolutely perfect.  She really 'gets' kids, and she knows, probably from direct experience, how fragile and impressionable children can be.  The set is worth it to me to hear her read that one story.

I do not believe that these can help kids learn to read, though.  And I would be remiss to advise parents to substitute real reading with these.  What we like to do is to read the stories before the DVD and then read an additional story afterward.  One more warning...Simms Taback could become your very next favorite author and illustrator.  He is very clever, and the colors and collages are bright and stimulating.",1228003200,45,1363,4.852173913043479

Thirdly, the animation is well-done though not overdone.  The pacing is slow, as when a book is read aloud.  This gives the listener a chance to absorb the story, just as he or she would if the story were being read aloud.  It even has the option to include the text on each page, if you have a blossoming reader.
