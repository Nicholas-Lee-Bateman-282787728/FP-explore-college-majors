The twists are intense and have indeed caught me off guard. I look forward to the next installment in the series, and truly hope the writers will continue to throw a couple curve balls our way.",1175040000,12,352,4.603174603174603

2750987,4,B000MX7V66,"Season three was very good - though it made the writers theory set in stone (as in they are from the future, religious twist, etc)...

The first two were based more on ones perception on how the events unfolded, but the third was pretty clear where the writers were coming from.

It was a very intereseting season, and I am anxious for season 4.

2750988,4,B000MX7V66,"The first two seasons of the 4400 were excellent, while the 3rd seemed to let the popularity go to its head.  In short, the season was good, but seemed to be purposely stretched out to ensure a season 4.  The quality of the shows, while still good, was a major step down from season 2 and 1.

Here's hoping that season 4 brings an ending to the series (in a fantastic sort of way) and that they won't pull the same ""Let's see how much mileage we can get out of it"" attitude they had in the 3rd season.

Still, a fantastic series, and well worth watching.",1170460800,33,554,4.149532710280374

2751012,5,B000MX7V66,"I loved this series, which began life as a mini-series on USA Network.  I liked everything about it from the theme song on.  Things began to fall off a little during the third season which I am sure led to its demise.  I love having this complete series now and being able to watch it wherever and whenever I choose.  It is based on the premise that 4400 people disappeared at different times during the 20th Century and then all came back at once circa 2002-03.  It shares a theme with alien abductions that we've all heard of, but this story is different.  I have it in my collection with the Dead Zone, Lost, Supernatural, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, et.al.

2751015,5,B000MX7V66,"I highly recommend watching this series. Sadly, it was cancelled after its 4th season. This DVD set is a great buy, IF you have any of the other seasons already. If not, there is a total series box-set that comes in a nice, shiny box and is probably a better purchase for you. I purchased this individual season because I already had the first two and didn't want to re-buy them.

Also, if you are a fan of the series Heroes, you will doubtlessly enjoy this series as well. In fact, one of the main plot lines of Heroes season 3 seems to have been taken directly from The 4400 and even featured a cameo by one of the actors.",1309824000,,624,4.2

However, if you have seen the first 2 seasons, you must purchase seaon 3.  Even if you thought season 2 dragged on a bit, this season 3 does not.  It is full of action and intrigue to keep the viewer interested and guessing.",1262044800,,350,4.028985507246377
2751019,4,B000MX7V66,"An excellent series, The 4400, brings to the screen the parallel stories of (mainly) five characters, Maia, Shawn, Isabelle, Richard, and Kyle, and the two Home Security agents charged with watching over the former abductees' affairs, Tom Baldwin and Diane Skouris.
Season 3 goes into more depth regarding the 4400 returnees and the plot thickens with an all out war involving 4400s and non-4400s all the more likely.
Joel Gretsch, Jacqueline McKenzie, and the rest of the cast continue to do a very good job with their performances, nevertheless, this season is not as great as the first season; rather similarly to the second season you get that feeling (at times) that you are watching a mundane soap opera. Moreover, there are characters such as Nina (who is not that great as NTAC director), Isabelle (enough already with the one way love story!), and April (who causes even the most patient and understanding person to contemplate the use of force) that take away from the overall enjoyment. In addition, Tom Baldwin for most of the season seems to live his life just fine with Kyle (his son) in prison!!! Finally, the writers also seem to be slipping with episodes such as Blink, which was a great letdown.
The 4400 is still a series worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, though seasons 2&3 have not lived up to the high expectations produced by the one that started it all.",1259971200,,1421,4.827868852459017
2751020,4,B000MX7V66,"I love this series and bought the whole collection. But for me, I didn't like most of the episodes, but yes I must have this season, and I do.  Much of it turned into almost a normal cop show (nothing wrong with a good cop show), but I wanted more Sci-Fi style.
I think most people and all fans will still enjoy the entertainment of probably all the episodes. The Last season is worth it all. The first was great toooo.",1257033600,,419,4.172839506172839
2751021,4,B000MX7V66,"Some new characters and changes occur in this season. If you were hooked on the first two seasons, you simply must catch up with the Third Season of the 4400.

Cinematically, this show is very pleasing to watch and I love the performances of Jac. McKenzie and Patrick Flueger.

A top show, 10/10 for this season.",1251504000,,312,4.553571428571429
2751022,5,B000MX7V66,I really loved this show when it come out on TV. I couldn't wait for the next episode. It was like nothing before on TV at that time.  Now you have Heros which is a knock off from this. But this is the best before all the rest. When I found the series on Amazon.com I bought it right away.,1243296000,,289,3.816666666666667
2751023,5,B000MX7V66,If you like the 4400 the 3rd season is a must have.  It is probably the best season of the series.,1227657600,,98,3.6666666666666665
2751024,4,B000MX7V66,"In its third season, ""The 4400"" delivers another twelve compelling episodes filled with tension, drama, reveals, plot twists, and a whole lot of moral greyness.  With the mysterious maturation of Isabelle, the death of Lily, the impending return of a resurrected Jordan Collier, Richard joining Shawn as head of the 4400 center, Kyle arrested, more of Tom's family in trouble with NTAC, and the now villainous Dennis Ryland as head of his own secret organization, it seems like all of the characters have suddenly become major players.  Any of them could be fighting for good and any of them could be fighting for evil.  At this point, all of the ideas of pure good and pure evil have been thrown out the window in favor of a theme of choices that runs through this season, and the characters do indeed have to make some hard ones.

The acting, which was admittedly pretty bad in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season/dp/B00062IDEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season</a>, continues to improve.  The entire cast is at least competent, and at times excellent.  Another improvement was the way that this season handled the long term story arc.  The episodes in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-season/dp/B000ERVJLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second season</a>&nbsp;were probably individually stronger, but this season excelled in executing the bigger, continuing arcs, such as the ever changing Isabelle story line, which was at once tragic and frightening.  One thing I thought was a bit off was how they handled the Nova group.  I thought they could have been great antagonists if they were more fleshed out, but instead they ended up being used as a plot device to show the true nature of Isabelle and, earlier, how Shawn has compromised the integrity of the 4400 Center.  I did, however, think amends were made when Jordan Collier (who was shown to be alive at the end of the second season) finally returned.

Overall, this is a quality season of a very good show.  I hope that, by the fourth season (which is also the last, as this series was cancelled) that we will get at least a few answers, because this is quickly becoming a story that I'm investing myself in.

8/10",1226793600,,2285,5.366946778711484
2751025,5,B000MX7V66,"I watched this in spurts, but was still able to keep up with it pretty well.  The storyline is as cohesive as ever, as the 4400s deal with various abilities, some of which are quite dangerous and can be easily exploited by them or by others.
The cast is solid, particularly Joel Gresch, as well as Jeffrey Combs and Summer Glau, better known for their previous work in Star Trek and Firefly/Serenity, respectively.  The character of Isabelle grows so powerful that her own father must fear her, while Jordan Collier returns with what may be apocalyptic plans.
We are left hanging in the season finale as the neon green drug is handed out to anyone who wants it, with a 50/50 chance of it stirring up abilities in non-4400s.
Looking forward to the fourth season.",1218931200,,761,4.62962962962963
2751026,4,B000MX7V66,"The story was great, as the first season was, but the price was way too much for the very short, two disk, abbreviated season and ending to a series that should have kept running. And to add shipping to that was an insult.",1215302400,,222,4.186046511627907
2751027,5,B000MX7V66,"This was by far my favorite season. Not only are the sub-plots more entertaining, but it seemed they picked up on the lagging action of season 2.
The addition of Isabelle gave this series an amazing boost of energy, and I loved the story line about the inhibitors expanding the 4400's powers even more. Also, Jordan Collier returns from the future, and has a devious plan for human kind.
Everything about this season was perfect. Cant wait to watch 4.",1215129600,,451,4.65
2751028,4,B000MX7V66,"Well written, well acted. Basically, 4400 abductees return in a ball of light, each with a special ability. The central tale revolves around a core group but each week there is a guest ability featured. There are many organizations trying to use the 4400 to its own ends so we have villains from government, industry and family all trying to take advantage of the talents demonstrated by the returnees. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's good and who's bad (and even who's dead and who's alive).

This show draws from many sources but still manages to be unique and stand on its own. It has a bit of the Andromeda Strain, H.G. Wells, Biblical figures, but mostly Dr. Seuss's ""The Sneetches"". (The star bellied Sneetches had bellies with stars; the plain bellied Sneetches had none upon thar's""). That's basically the whole premise - Do you want a star or not? Is having a star better than not? This may sound simplistic but the writers weave episode after episode, season after season's stories around this age old question - Is what we want really best for us?
In my estimation, each season is quite equal so I'm using this review for each. Watch and enjoy....bg",1214352000,,1171,4.684466019417476
2751029,5,B000MX7V66,"I have been a fan of `The 4400' since season 1. Though most reviewers will disagree, I found this season to be the best of them all. In this season, we finally get to know why the 4400 were abducted.

Though this season was great, I do have a few comments:

1. The season is too short. I think they should add a few more episodes to every season.

2. I loved Isabelle, but didn't like the way the writers were sexually exploiting her. There were a few unnecessary French kissing scenes that I found to be vulgar, especially in close-up. I know that many reviewers will disagree with me, but I think the kissing scenes could have been more tastefully done.

3. I do get the feeling in some episodes if the writers really know where they are going. Some episodes seem to just be thrown in as fillers.

4. The return of Jordan Collier was great and unexpected. He is one of the best characters in the show.

I am looking forward for season 4. Will there be war between the 4400, the new 4400s, and humans? Would you want to be a superhuman?

2751030,4,B000MX7V66,"This series continues to hold one's interest, although this season saw some unrealistic plot twists that caused one to question the writers' credibiity.  For example, the way Kyle was ultimately sprung from jail, and that whole plot line, just didn't ring true.  With that said, the series continued to provoke mystery and interest in the characters, and ended deliciously smart.  Can't wait to Season 4 comes out, and the series to resume on USA.

Particularly fascinating is the series' placing such a vague *reason* for the abduction of 4400 people.  It *still* hasn't been completely answered to my satisfaction and unending curiosity.  The plotline focuses upon the daily lives of NTAC operatives and 4400 ""abilities,"" thoroughly engrossing in its consistency and content.

2751047,2,B000MX7V66,"This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon and I buy all my books and dvds from them.  I love seasons 1 & 2, but this season was utterly appalling.  The entire storyline with Isabella, which I might add was poorly acted out, was ludicrous and overdone.  The visions that Jordan Collier brings from the future of an aristocratic society protected in a city from commoners is also crazy. So who are the people of the aristocratic society, the 4400s or member of the distant government?

All the episodes seem rushed to get somewhere, I just don't know where. All the actors seemed to have dropped a notch in their acting performace this season, like their hearts just weren't in it.

As for the plot, I can only guess that Jordan Collier's idea is to make as many people as possible a 4400 type person. That will make everyone in the future a ""gifted person"", since there will be generations of intermixing betweens 4400s, new 4400s, and normal people, I guess the potential outcome would be a society completely full of 4400 type people, therefore eliminating the separated society in the future.

I suppose I am rambling on about this ""not so good"" season, so I will stop.  I don't recommend buying the season 3 dvds.",1180828800,3,1229,4.584474885844749

2751051,3,B000MX7V66,"I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of this show and think the premise is generally interesting.  However, I think the writers are having a difficult time communicating their vision or, like many shows with great premises, are making it up as they go along.  Below I detail what are some of the problems dragging down the generally good dialogue and good individual episodes.  If you can look past the problems in the story arcs, the majority of episodes remain very good if you don't think about it.

SPOILERS ALERT

So, in this season we learn that in the future there is technology of such an amazing degree that they can send people back in time regularly and have the ability to give humans amazing and important super powers, but they can't solve their own meager problems.  We don't know what future catastrophe they are trying to evade (but in one episode we find that an amazing leap in our level of scientific knowledge may help), but we know the dystopia they face is a world with one city that is powerful and ""ok"" with walls keeping out the rest who presumably are not so well off.  We don't know who sent back the 4400, or Isabelle (who has a mission to eradicate the 4400s).  Was it is the city or those out of the city?  If its those outside the city, the plot makes no sense since that means they have this incredible technology and aren't using it, if it is the city why don't they just start helping the people outside the walls?  I think we are supposed to believe the city is evil and hoarding all the resources (except world changing technology...), and those outside the city are trying to avert the current state.  But, its not clear yet and it does not need to be clear.  If it ever is it might make sense, but I'm really starting to doubt it.

So, problems like this are nagging at the show, and I don't get the feeling that the writers have good coherent answers after this season.

The show also has occasional religious overtones, which are amusing but mostly embarrassing.  I confess that if someone had the power to heal we would no doubt revere that person and possibly worship them...unless we knew how they did it.  We admire science but don't worship it.  In this show every person who watches the news now knows that the 4400s have their powers due to specific generally understood scientific reasons.  It would make as much sense to worship the iPhone or your doctor when they give you antibiotics as to revere the 4400. The fact that the writers can't make this distinction between science, religion, and the supernatural is awkward.

Mia.  Mia can see the future.  This ruins about 80% of the plot episodes, if they acknowledged it.  But they don't, but we know she can so it really is always an ever present plot hole.  During this season Mia supposedly even gets so she can control her ability, making many of the dilemmas even more ridiculous.

Isabelle.  Supposedly Isabelle is a super genius based on the first few episodes but devolves into someone with the mind of a 10 year old that is always making sub-par decisions.  I like her role on the show, and personally since I have decided the 4400 are the catastrophe root for her to destroy them all, but her being a genius one episode and then a dimwit for most of the season is tiresome and disrespectful to the audience.

There are other problems of course.  The amorality of Collier, the dramatic personality change of the neuroscientist on the show, and the useless end result produced by Colliers big plan.  So, now there will be 11,000 ""4400s"" instead of 4400?  Hmmm....why does that matter?  Why didn't the future people just send back 10,000 to start with and save all the internecine fighting?

Despite these complaints, I will continue to follow the show and think it still beats many things out there.  But it always saddens me when the wheels come off a potentially fantastic chassis.",1180396800,5,3885,4.575976845151954

It's not about evolution.  It's about the good in mankind overcoming the bad.

The twists and turns helped this show evolve from a story of abductions and futuristic sci-fi lore into an entirely prolonged story of the human race's struggle to survive.

2751057,2,B000MX7V66,"With each subsequent season, this show has gotten worse. A great premise squandered by writers who don't seem to know what direction they want to go.

This season they got rid of some really good characters and added new ones that didn't click. They aged Isabelle which was a big mistake not only because the actress was horrible but the character too. They got rid of Lily and Kyle (for a majority of the season anyway) and everything went even more downhill after that. Add to this that they also increased Shawn's part which brought nothing to the story or show. Who cares anymore? I don't.

I kept waiting for something good to happen and it never did. So, this is where I check out. No Season 4 for me.

Best thing is Joel Gretsch who lights up every scene he is in.",1179100800,,771,4.3776223776223775
2751058,4,B000MX7V66,"1. Money

TV shows, in an effort to capture viewers, pour heaps of money into production initially. Once the viewer base has been established, the drawstrings get tightened. A good example of this is soundtracks.  Pilot episodes generally have huge budgets to purchase songs, but as the series progresses, the music will invariably switch from being purchased to being  composed.  There are a few good composers out there, but, generally speaking, purchased music will always be better/more timely.

Special effects/CGI - same thing.  CGI is super expensive.  Invariably a show starts off with a load of CGI and episode by episode, the CGI decreases.  A good example of this is Battlestar Galactica. Have you noticed the diminishing frequency of robot cylon shots as the series progresses? Those robot cylons are CGI and cost a pretty penny. For a science fiction show, CGI is crucial as it allows the writers greater creative freedom. If the CGI budget is thin, it can restrict plot points and, in turn, lower the quality of the show.

Actors are a huge budgetary concern as well. They generally start off being paid very little. If the show does well, they start asking for more money. If they ask for too much, their characters tend to either get killed off or go on hiatus. Another problem with actors from successful shows is that they get other work. This other work can create scheduling problems.

One of the biggest obstacles to consistently great television is syndication. The bread and butter of syndicated television are episodes that can stand alone. No meta arcs/no continuing storylines. Even on shows with stories that span seasons, there is a huge push from the studio to produce the much more syndicatable single arc episodes. A single arc episode doesn't allow for larger, grander themes. There's really only so much you can do in 44 minutes. By compartmentalizing a show into smaller, more marketable units, meta arcs suffer and the quality invariably drops. The one mitigating factor in the syndication equation is DVD sales.  The potential proceeds from DVD sales is beginning to challenge the profits from syndication.  Where syndication is sold in single episodes, DVDs are all about the boxed set. This is an encouraging direction, but we have a long way to go before syndication loosens it grasp.

2. The writing process

A very important aspect to television production is the way in which episodes are written.  It's not like some huge novel where a writer locks themselves in remote cabin, takes months to write and emerges with a beginning to end epic. The pilot may be mulled over by the creator for quite some time and worked/reworked ad infinitum, but once the show gets picked up, it's usually a group of writers, sitting in a room, crafting an episode at a time.  This makes the writing timely, but it doesn't do much for the bigger picture/larger story. Hopefully someone, somewhere (usually the creator and/or executive producer) has a road map for each season and/or the entire series, but this doesn't always happen. Even when it does occur, this road map may not be all that fleshed out. Or unforeseen obstacles occur such as an actor asking for too much money or a scheduling conflict. Even if the creator of a show wanted to write the whole thing from beginning to end, he/she would be severely limited by the fact that they would have no idea of knowing how many seasons they'd have to work with. Needless to say, it's not the type of writing atmosphere that produces grand ideas/great stories. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, writers toss around a lot of crappy ideas until the deadline approaches and then, under the gun, pick the least crappiest idea for the episode. Sad, but true. Look at where Lost has ended up- that's an excellent example of a room full of writers winging it- and not that well, I might add.

There are a handful of shows that have managed to exceed these limitations, but the list is minuscule.  24 is a good example of a show that pulled it together in later seasons. Most of the Star Trek productions seem to take a few seasons to reach their stride (they did have a continuing influx of money, though). For the most part, though, episodic television is a downward slope.  4400 is no exception.  It started with a bang, was spectacular the first season, great the second, but now, it's only good. Will it improve? I'm not holding my breath.",1178755200,7,4431,4.79002624671916
