8587760,5,B00CZ2HWL6,"After Newtown Guns in America, 2013 film

Guns have been part of America since Europeans landed. They were part of life. but more have been killed in the last 45 years than in all wars. People give their opinions about guns. Taxes on firearms and ammunition go to support wildlife conservation. But mass shootings create controversy. Chicago is today the murder capital of America but you cant buy a firearm there. [In 1963 the murder capital was Dallas; what has changed?] Flintlock smoothbore muskets were used from the 17th century to the 1830's. Early settlers faced dangers. All men were required to be armed. The Second Amendment documented this natural right. In 1836 Samuel Colt invented the six-shooter revolver which became very popular. In the 1870's the repeating rifle could hold seventeen rounds. The National Rifle Association was created to train people in aimed fire after the Civil War. Prohibition created violence among gangsters over lucrative trade in alcohol.

Western movies used guns as part of their stories. [So too horses!] In 1967 California passed a law banning the carrying of loaded firearms, Governor Reagan signed it. The Federal government passed the 1968 Gun Control Act. The NRA began to support popular rights to own guns. In the 1970's there were improvements that allowed pistols to contain more bullets. Most crime in big cities results from illegal drug sales; drug dealers must protect themselves as they cant call the police if they are robbed. New rifles patterned after the military M-16 became popular because of its features. Most urban shootings involve pistols. Gun shows provide opportunities to buy guns; one selling point is protection. One victim tells of the mass shooting in an Aurora Colorado movie theater. 3-D printers can produce gun parts without legal controls, the plans are available on the Internet. Should all gun owners be penalized because of the crimes of a few?

This program provides an even overview of the issues. It does not mention that the killer of the grammar school children first went to his high school but avoided it because he saw a police car there. That is the reason why people say some teachers and other school personnel should be armed. Why should people be armed for protection? The same reason why countries have an armed military for protection against attacks. The description of a bullet that makes a larger exit hole is less true for a military-style bullet with a full metal jacket to prevent this expansion.

Prior to the school shooting Newtown was famous for the woodchipper murder. A man murdered his wife and disposed of her body by grinding it to bits in a woodchipper machine. But a tooth and bone fragments allowed identification by DNA evidence.

The gang warfare among distributors of alcoholic beverages during Prohibition echoes the violence among countries that sought lucrative trade. Your history books have examples, but you have to closely read their accounts. One foreign example was the Opium Wars where Great Britain forced the import of Indian opium into China. Unhappy people seek solace in substances, some of them more dangerous than others.",1510012800,,3161,5.059500959692898
8587761,3,B00CZ2HWL6,"This documentary is okay on its own merits, looking at the history of gun control and ownership in America, but it has nothing to do with school shootings in general and makes no reference to the Newton massacre. It blames the rise of gun violence in the 19th century on the invention of the revolver, thus divorcing the topic of gun violence from violence in general by embracing technological determinism. It makes no reference to how gun violence has been going down in recent years while gun sales have been going up. There was not a single mention of any development in the gun control debate since the Newton school massacre. The most recent event in the documentary seems to be the mention of the 2004 lapse of the ""Assault Rifle Ban.""",1390176000,2,742,4.628787878787879
8587762,4,B00CZ2HWL6,"This 55-minute program which aired on PBS is probably the most objective documentary on a very heated subject. The first half spends it's time on giving a history of guns from the rifles used in the American revolution to the civil war and on to the invention of the pistol by Colt.  We learn how prohibition brought on the rise of machine guns and how the National Rifle Association began. I found this all very educational and learned things I didn't know. Then the documentary moves to the recent tragedies in Aurora and Newton, CT and we hear from victims of those shootings.  We also hear from people about gun shows. No sides are really taken and everyone (pro- and anti-gun laws) has a chance to speak.

There are interviews with well-known people like Bill Cosby (whose son was killed by a gun) and Frank Serpico (the retired NY cop who was played by Al Pacino in the film ""Serpico"") The President of the NRA Well is here too.

This show will not solve the problem of illegal guns in America but, as I said, I did learn the history behind the issue in a well balanced program.
There are no bonus features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
