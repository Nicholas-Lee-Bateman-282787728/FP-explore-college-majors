8332600,5,B001P9EX7Q,"The host of Lunkerville (Mike de Avila) goes fishing with Regular Joes that explain the various lures, techniques, and  presentations that catch bass. It's a great DVD because the instruction is from weekend warriors very willing to divulge the secrets of the trade. The instruction is very friendly and Mike de Avila's laid back, self-depricating manner and humor make the video very entertaining. If you are new to bass fishing, this video is a must buy! Even if you are an experienced angler, I'm confident you'll take something away from this DVD.",1371081600,,551,4.989130434782608

8332602,2,B001P9EX7Q,"it's really basic info. too basic. he should follow up with more details like how to tie rigs, tie hooks etc...  i'm going to show this to childern for basic 101.  for people who never fished before it's a good basic info..",1350518400,,223,4.285714285714286
8332603,5,B001P9EX7Q,"I've always liked Lunkerville, so it's nice to have a dvd of the show to watch when I want. I call it the ""very"" common mans fishing show because we all don't own $22,000.00 Nitros and fish with a half dozen St. Croix and Carrot Stix rods rigged with the same $20.00 lure in different colors. The tips and tactics are great for those of us who take our fishing seriously but have to do it on a slightly leaner budget.  The show is also entertaining and Mike D. comes across as a good guy you wouldn't mind fishing with. He partially accomplishes that by being the inexperienced guy on the boat getting as much info. as he can from the guest angler. The self depricating humor at his own fishing woes is a funny and nice little twist to the show.",1265500800,4,745,4.246478873239437
