8707176,2,B00UKG72OQ,"I purchased this video with the intent to show it to my 8th-grade Health class in order to demonstrate the consequences of alcohol use.  Unfortunately, the actors are all British and it starts out with a brewing company explaining how to brew beer.  High School and College students may connect better with this information, but it is not ideal for my age group.  More details should have been included in the description outlining the intended audience.  Very disappointed.",1524355200,,474,5.038461538461538
