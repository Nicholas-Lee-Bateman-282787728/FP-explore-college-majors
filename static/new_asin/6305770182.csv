1069721,4,6305770182,"The movie follows a serial killer, Vann (Owen Wilson) , into a small town to start a new life.  Before he gets there he meets ""Laurie"" (Sheryl Crow), a dead beat drug user.  When Vann arrives in the small  town, some locals begin to disappear.  No one really knows who or what is  doing it.  Vann has a job as a postman and becomes friends with Janeane  Garofalo's character and the story unfolds from there. Janeane Garofalo has  been in some not-so-great movies as of late, but this was one that was  sadly over looked.  Sheryl Crow's first acting roll is a must see.  She  pulls it off well. This is the first time I've seen Owen Wilson, and now I  think I'll go look him up on Amazon to see what else he is in.  All three  actor's performances are wonderful and the movie is told in a  not-so-traditional manner, making for a great film.  DVD extras include:  Serial Killer biographies, Theatrical and video trailers, production notes,  cast & creww information, and more.",956448000,31,976,4.505747126436781
1069722,3,6305770182,"I had heard nothing about this film when I rented it the other day.  In that respect I was pleasantly suprised.  This film really is not as bad as some of the other reviewers here say.  It does not have the gloss of high  budget movies like The Bone Collector, but I found that it made me think  and get involved in a way that the Denzel Washington movie never did. This  is not to say that it is a perfect film.  I thought the whole idea of  randomness(the killer deciding which way to go on the highway) was a good  idea, but they seem to shove it down your throat.  I also thought the scene  with Sheryl Crow spelling her name for the killer was a weak attempt to  immitate the Elizabeth Shue's classic scene from Leaving Las Vegas. What  interested me about the film above the minor blemishes listed above(I only  mentioned a couple of these) was how it is hard not to like the killer.  There are many scenes where I found myself hoping that he hadn't killed a  person because I wanted to like him.  I found this impulse much more  frightning than if the character had been a real menacing guy who was easy  to hate.  Especially powerful was the scene where he starts to beat up on  his girlfriend when she wants to make out and we realize that he doens't  know how to be intimate. Worth a view as a worthy attempt to put something  beyond the typical hollywood trash on the screen.",956016000,5,1386,4.246153846153846
1069723,2,6305770182,"I'm a fan of offbeat, quirky little movies, and what I'd heard about this one made me think it would be right up my alley, but no, it started to turn in to my alley and then stalled. Way too slow, way too deliberately  strange; like David Lynch, only not very good. I found the pacing of every  scene to be annoying, the non-sequiters overdone, and what the heck is  going on with Owen Wilsons'nose anyway? You want a strange little movie  nobody ever heard of starring a bland, blonde leading man, and a sort of  mathematical title? Try ""The Zero Effect"".",955929600,4,556,4.411764705882353
1069724,4,6305770182,"If you are looking for a different take on serial killers, this is for you. A ride through the mind of a reserved, calmatic killer. He doesn't kill with rage or aggression but by stealth and tranquility. Carrying on  conversations with a battling conscience, in the form of two FBI agents.  Garofalo throws herself at this armaretto toting character, unbeknowest to  her the inner demon tormenting him. This is a clever film, worth a look.",955670400,6,439,4.826666666666667
1069725,5,6305770182,"This film lived up to all of my expectations. I'd seen the ad campaign and heard reviews from friends saying it was an intense film, and after watching it, I had to agree! I thought it was a terrific adaptation from  the book, and I was as much disturbed as I was pleased. I love to have my  ideas of normalcy challenged! Owen Wilson played the part really well-  toned down and kind on the outside... Garofalo played a smitten, sensitive  woman for the first time I've seen, and was perfect in her role! All the  acting in this movie is great, but I was most surprised by Sheryl Crow's  performance. She was totally in character and a lot of fun to watch.
I  had to own this movie- I found that it translated great on DVD in  widescreen.",950832000,32,738,4.258992805755396
1069810,1,6305770182,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever produced. I have no idea why the average rating is three stars because there's no way anyone can even make sense of the movie. It's slow. It's boring. It's filled with meaningless dialogue that serves no purpose other than to waste time. And if that's not bad enough, the ending also ranks as the worst ending ever. Pathetic! I have a friend who has long insisted that Hudson Hawk is the worst movie ever. After seeing about 10 minutes of it, I can see his point. Dumb! But I challenged him to watch Minus Man, and he now agrees that Hudson moves to #2. Do not waste your time with this movie.",1480291200,,629,4.338983050847458

Her acting was so bad I kind of felt sorry for her. It's a good thing her character was killed off early on  And if Owen Wilson was going for a completely flat uninteresting character, like maybe someone that a frontal lobotomy had been part of his past then he nailed it!

1070206,4,6305770182,"After watching ""Minus Man"" (MM), I will say that Owen Wilson, who plays the drifter Vann Siegert, is maybe the nicest serial killer (SK) that you will ever ""meet.""

After all, he strolls into town, buys a gal he doesn't know at a bar a drink -- pays her entire bill, as a matter of fact -- gets a job at the post office, is willing to take on extra work when a coworker has a heart attack, stays mostly to himself, and doesn't really target any females to kill in nasty ways.  Oh, sure, maybe he targets Sheryl Crowe early on in the first Act to kill.  But when you see her ""acting abilities,"" you really won't miss her much in the second and third acts anyways.  (I can't believe Ms. Crowe is listed as a lead actress here, by the way.  She's only in the film long enough to have a beer, shoot up, and get killed.)

Vann's murder-weapon-of-choice:  poison.  Something he picked up on while wandering the wilds of the Pacific Northwest, according to the movie.  And this is no surprise that he lived there for awhile; after all, supposedly 50 percent of the world's serial killers come from that area, according to statistics.

But most SKs are more ""hands-on"" types of guys.  In reality, if you read enough books from FBI profilers, you will read that those profilers usually call poisoners ""cowards.""  So hurtful if you're a poisoning SK, I suppose.  But there probably is some truth to it.  Most of these SKs like to kill from a distance, and they don't like getting up-close-and-personal.  I read a book awhile back with the more-than-mouthful title ""Poison Mind:  The True Story of the Mensa Murderer -- And the Policewoman Who Risked Her Life to Bring Him to Justice.""  Now I can take a breath, unlike most of the victims in this movie.  But anyways, it was a pretty decent read, about a guy named George Trepal, that was so smart that he was in Mensa but so stupid that he killed his neighbor with poison and so stupider that he got caught doing it.  But if Mr. Trepal was the true killer -- most of the evidence was pretty circumstantial -- then I will admit, he was truly a ""coward.""  He's probably a ""coward"" either way.

And if this film has any weaknesses, it might be that Mr. Olsen isn't exactly convincing as a ""standard"" serial killer.  He's just too nice.  But he does have moments of badness, like when he slips a Mickey into a guy's drink in a diner.  And he's so nice that, when someone tells him at one point that ""he'll end up just like Ted Bundy,"" Vann doesn't even know who Bundy is.  How can you come from the Northwest and NOT know who Ted Bundy is?  Or was?  Maybe you were too busy learning how to take mushrooms and make poison?

Without giving too much away, early on in the film, Vann -- who plays the narrator as well as the poisoner -- says something like, ""I know that someday, I will meet men that I don't know.  Men that will ask me questions.""  And you know that those men will be murder detectives.  At least Vann knows that his murdering days are numbered.  But there are a couple of imaginary detectives that periodically ask Vann questions throughout the movie, and I though it actually works here.  It reminded me of Kevin's Costner's sidekick in the underrated film ""Mr. Brooks.""  (I didn't like the ending of that film, however, as the character does something that is absolutely out-of-character.)

Well, what's the motivation for Vann's crimes?  Who knows?  I don't think he even knows himself.  And I'm not convinced that I knew after watching this film.  Not that it matters.  I mean, after all, ""it's not the destination, but the journey,"" as they say.  And this film is quirky enough that I enjoyed riding along in Vann's truck as he moves on to new places.  And finds new people to poison.",1470873600,,3740,4.447717231222386

Every character was acted well. Jenene Garafolo seems to be aging backward!  I totally enjoyed the acting though I need to watch the end again to try and figure it out. It's certainly a reminder not to take people at face value. Either way, I just enjoyed the wonderful performances.  Owen needs to do more movies with substance, he's got the comedy down so it's good to be challenged with a complex plot full of contradiction. I would have enjoyed a few more clues to his origins.

This is an excellent performance from Owen Wilson and the whole ensemble. The storyline and pacing brings a very different and intimate approach that separates it from any other of the genre that I have seen. It's done without mayhem and titillation.

We learn about Vann, played brilliantly by Owen Wilson, through his thoughts as the narrator of the film. He is the low-key, friendly kind of guy that can show up in town, and immediately get people to like him, and unwisely dismiss the fact they know nothing about him.
He responds to a ""Room for Rent"" ad by  a husband and wife in the local seaside town paper.
Doug and Jane are a middle-aged couple who never explain completely the absence of their daughter pictured in a graduation photo.
However, it is deeply felt, and the audience gets the feeling, for whatever reason, she is never coming back.

Vann is an atypical serial killer...non-violent, not sexually motivated, kills men and women. He thinks about his victims in a very matter of fact way, mostly random but connected to an event, requiring very little planning, and describing his actions as necessary.  The first victim we see he kills while his truck engine is running.

The couple both come to like Vann especially Doug, who gets Vann a job with him at the post office, and allows Vann to practice his ""hobby"" on his free time
All the characters are complex, troubled souls, brought to life in an eerie, Twilight Zone kind of way, with a sensational cast and outstanding direction. Even the scoring is subtle, but precise, and it all fits together to make a little jewel of a film.

 Janeane Garafolo was outstanding. One of her best roles.

Eccentric, Surreal, Chilling, Absorbing.  Loved it.

POST SCRIPT SPOILER ALERT!!!

I like to watch films like this, and look for the subtle clues about a character like Vann's former life and inner self, what motivates him, and what made him who he is.

Vann says the first thing you need to find out about a person is if they can hurt you. Most people aren't concerned with that. It suggests to me that he could have been a foster kid, and had to be in fear of his safety, and be able to assess the safety of changing surroundings.  As a serial killer, he had to figure out who could be a threat to him being found out.

Also, very interesting that a movie about serial killing had NO sexual undertones, except one disturbing scene.

Doug was obviously smitten with Gene, the high school football player, and son of his good friends.  Since Doug and Jane's daughter left home, or at least was gone................somewhere, Doug focused his hopes on Gene.

Vann could see this when they all went out for pizza after the game.  When Doug  mentioned Gene wanted to join the FBI after college, the audience worries for Gene's future
But Gene seemed like such an amiable kid, I don't think Vann was that threatened by the FBI. I think a part of Vann was wanting family, and it was Doug's fondness for Gene that troubled Vann.
Remember Vann was wondering to himself why he went against two of his rules with Gene?  Never kill anyone you know, or who lives in the same town.

The sort of dreamlike scene where Vann is out in the yard the next day, imagining himself as Gene, the game hero the night before, on his back on the lawn, seems to show Vann's longing we know will never be satisfied.

Right after that scene, Vann realizes he feels ""normal"", like relaxed and at home.  He immediately gets his supply of poison and goes after Gene.

We don't know when he began killing or drifting. It is likely he began killing first.
Maybe he started for the sake of his percieved safety at first, and had to leave.  Maybe that became part of a mission. Maybe he also developed a taste for it. But the serial nature kept him on the road, and he saw the necessity of using the rare poison as a very effective, portable method of operation.

It also seemed his practice gave him a certain power, and his life a kind of distorted sense of purpose.

""Sometimes what you do chooses you"",

The most telling, and chilling scene about Vann's psyche, was the playful roughhousing with Garofolo that turned violent.
After she furiously fought him off, he recoiled into a fetal position and said, "" I thought it was what you wanted""

He seemed to revert to a frightened child who did not know how sex worked. Maybe he was exposed to violent sex or sexual abuse as a child, and never had an adult sexual relationship.
I think the imaginary FBI agents, who represented his paranoia about getting caught, also represented the impermanence of his existence, and inability to have a normal life.",1468627200,3,4715,4.540189125295508

1070975,3,6305770182,"I enjoyed this dark comedy/thriller with Owen Wilson as Vann who uses a mixture of amaretto and a poisonous fungus to kill his prey. He selects most of his subjects for their complaining about their lives and their desire to die  or that their lives are miserable (whether they mean it or not) as he travels from place to place. He settles in a small town and rents a room from Doug and Jane played by Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl after winning them over with his charm.  The trailer states that its his charm is that wins people over, but I found his odd demeanor more of as cause for concern than disarming. Part of the story is narrated by Wilson giving info on his subjects, himself and his eventual capture and what he will say to law enforcement and the greving families. I found the story to be refreshing and cleverly written, but underdeveloped for Wilson's character and what leads him to take the path of murdering the people he casually meets. He touches on the subject during one of his narrations, but only in a passing thought. He has a code or rule of conduct where he never gets violent with anyone and the poison he uses is fast acting and acts like a sleeping pill that you never wake from. He has other rules, but I don't want to give everything away. The production values are very good and include direction, acting, locations, cinematography, editing and to a slightly lesser degree the clever writing. I feel that 4 stars is just out of reach for this movie for Wilson's under developed character history and the at times uneven pacing of the story. This is by no means an action type of movie, so if thats what you are looking for you may want to try another movie for this one is somewhat slow paced. I am yet again in the minority with my review of only a 3 star rating, but I feel its an honest review as well as the 4 and 5 star reviews. Was it worth the time? Yes. Would I watch it again? After a while I might. 3.7 Stars

1070977,4,6305770182,"This is one of those films where it is the main character - and the portrayal thereof - that makes it worth watching. In other words, the ""story line"" is of secondary importance (my favorite example of such being ""Bullitt""). Wilson's laconic laid-back portrayal of a gypsy-like serial killer - the most difficult to catch, by the way - is spot on. This is no
Texas Chainsaw Massacre style of movie, even the violence is dispensed with via a poison that just puts the victim to sleep (eternally).

Beneath the calm demeanor, however, we are made privy to many of Vann's thoughts, which are as chilling in their sociopathic amorality as his exterior is bland.

The story takes on a more quaint dimension when Vann (the protagonist) finds his way into a small coastal town, where he rents a room from a somewhat dysfunctional middle-aged couple.
They, and his on-again off-again relationship with a girl working at the post office where he works, offer a degree of ""color"" to the film. Yeah,I have a couple of ""problems"" with
the film's story, including a couple of detectives that are figments of Vann's imagination, and a conclusion that has more than a couple of holes in it.

But it's Wilson that carries the film and makes it an enjoyable watch.",1332892800,,1247,4.7110091743119265

Wilson uses his mellow, Mr. Nice Guy persona to its utmost, playing a soulless killer who wanders effortlessly into the proximity of his unwitting victims, in order to relieve them of their troubled lives. Though not a typical horror / thriller film, MINUS MAN is filled w/ a poisonous dread that slithers and sneaks its way into our heads. Seger is the sort of person that we don't mind talking to. He is whatever we want him to be. He is a mirror. A cypher. A deadly beast with no conscience, wrapped in a warm, cozy blanket.

Owen Wilson is our killer. He is a nice guy. A quiet guy that is unassuming and you wouldn't ever expect him to have the nature he has hidden away. Through the movie, we see how he interacts with people and has this way of maneuvering around situations in ways that he is getting information on people and the way he thinks. He is also at odds with what he is. He almost doesn't want people to take the last drink (poison). He is not cutting throats or bashing skulls here. He has a non-violent way of killing. Also his victims are already heading towards death when he decides to ""assist"" them on their way.
Janeane Garofalo, Brian Cox, Mercedes Ruehl, Dwight Yoakam and Sheryl Crow all added to the cast make for a decent thriller.
I'm not sure why it has zero special features but the movie itself is still great.
Without spoiling the ending, we are left with a possible part 2 that I am patiently awaiting.",1298592000,,1140,4.331775700934579
1071031,5,6305770182,"I have watched this movie numerous times.  Owen Wilson is mesmerizing in it.  Although his character is a serial killer, he is not shown to be creatively violent the way that most movies (such as The Bone Collector) do.  He is the kind of nice guy that you want to meet, like when you do meet them, and never would suspect that they kill people they don't even know.  The voice-over by Wilson's character gives you an idea that although he doesn't really seem to want to kill, and certainly doesn't want to kill violently, he still has the compulsion to kill.  In the film, he finally breaks his own rule about only killing strangers, but he does it believing that he is doing the victim a favor.  I never get tired of this movie, and it shows Wilson's dramatic skills, as pretty much all the other movies I have seen of his have been comedies (Zoolander, Shangai Noon, Night at the Museum, among others).  I highly recommend this movie to those who like a thoughtful character study.  Do not recommend to people expecting a highly charged thriller with a violent serial killer whose motives are never explained.  Also, Janeane Garofalo plays a serious character (she was hilarious in Mystery Men, with Owen Wilson's buddy, Ben Stiller), and Dwight Yoakem has done some good work in terrific movies like Sling Blade and Red Rock West.",1295568000,,1334,4.642553191489362

1071034,4,6305770182,"Vann Siegert (Owen Wilson) is a laid-back drifter.  Approaching a small seaside town, he runs into heroin addict Laurie Bloom (Sheryl Crow) in a dive bar.  Taking her for a drive, he offers her a drink from his special flask ... amaretto and poison.  Leaving the body in a roadside restroom, he continues into town.

Once in town, Vann takes a room from the Durwins.  Doug Durwin (Brian Cox, the best Hannibal Lector from 'Manhunter') takes to Vann immediately, but Jane Durwin (Mercedes Ruel, The Fisher King) is cold at first.  Doug is quite fond of young HS football player Gene, and is deeply affected when Gene goes missing.  Gene is a victim of Vann's, though Vann broke two of his own rules.  (Don't give a drink to someone you know, and don't do anything in the town you live in)  Doug gets Vann a job at the local Post Office, where Vann meets Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), who smokes and drinks, two things Vann doesn't do.  Vann and Ferrin hit it off anyway, and Vann settles into his new residence and new life.  But there are parts of his old life he won't give up, and the killing continues.

'The Minus Man' is not a fast-paced thriller.  It's a casual stroll through Vann's life, narrated by him, revealing his personal thoughts on life, other people, and killing.  Vann suffers from fainting spells, in which two detectives from his past haunt him.  Det. Blair (Dwight Yoakam, who proved he could act in 'Sling Blade') and Det. Graves (Dennis Haysbert) appear in his subconscious, asking questions about his reason for killing.  Even Van himself is befuddled at some of his actions, and often uses humor instead of explanations in his answers.

Owen Wilson always plays such a laid-back role (Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Shanghai Noon, Shanghai Knights, etc.) that it was a surprise to see him cast as a serial killer.  But the casual pace of the movie, combined with Vann's tranquil narration of his motives, is fully suited to Wilson's characteristic relaxed persona.  The acting is very good and the characters are interesting.  The plot is terrific and the twists surprising and inspired.  This is a great movie to rent or buy.

1071035,4,6305770182,"Films about serial killers, in my humble opinion, have a tendency to be convoluted. They either use the gimmicks and glamor of Hollywood( Casting Selma Hayak as Martha Beck, the lovelorn nurse, hefty in girth, but not in morality)to seduce your sensibilities, or create an unpalatable monster( Laura Prepon as Karla Holmoka, a sadist with a beautiful face). Owen Wilson recreates the serial killer as a character. He placates you with a charming, articulate persona, then proceeds to blindside the viewer with acts of non-violent murder. He never attempts to justify his actions with rationality, or some purpose based complex. He is...as he says...empty. Its difficult for me to imagine a man like Owen Wilson as a serial  killer. His face seems so open, and inviting, his kindness appears sincere and non-threatening. Perhaps this is the genius of the casting choice. He is the Elephant in the room, with his complete lack of emotional flux.

The Minus Man is about a seemingly normal young man who is drifting from town to town.  He is good looking, friendly, laid back.  An everyday kind of guy.  But that's the true horror behind it.  One of his hobbies is killing people.
The reasons for this is left a question mark.  That's what is the most frightening.  He has no mental problems, no dark past, no chip on his shoulder.  He could be anybody--you're best friend, neighbor, co-worker.

1071061,4,6305770182,"Almost 5 stars. Almost. An engrossing indy film as any I've seen, we witness a seemingly harmless man, a man we find ourselves actually liking, kill off a handful of strangers without so much as a second thought. He is a serial killer, and his weapon of choice is poison. His activities are naturally alarming, and there is no explanation as to why he feels the intrinsic desire to kill certain people. He just kills them. No certain profile is needed. He kills business men and pretty doped-up women (Sheryl Crow). He wins them over with his innocence and strangely enough, it's not a contrived innocence. It's real. You get the impression that Wilson's character is truly just attempting to feel something, make something of his world that surrounds him with uneasy numbness.

Halfway through the film, our Minus Man befriends a family who rents him a room. He witnesses their domestic disputes with childlike fascination, particularly concerning the disappearance of their college-aged daughter, who the family says left home to find her own way - but leaves the viewer thinking otherwise - and finds himself in jeopardy when the man of the household finally has enough with his wife and....

Well, I don't want to spoil it. This is not an agenda film - like Monster - where you're supposed to empathize with the serial killer. It's merely a fictional story where we get to travel into the life of a man who's seemingly as normal and sincere as anyone we've ever known, with the beamy smile and courteous manner to boot, but deep down, has a desperate desire to kill at random. When he does kill, he doesn't seem to enjoy it very much. He just does it, unflinchingly does it.

Not a gory film by any stretch, you never really see anyone die - just the heavy insinuations. Only about a fifth of the film actually encompasses Wilson's dark side.

  That lame joke sums up Wilson's character: banal, empty, a cipher, a void, a nil, a negative number, ""a minus man."" So what is it about this character, who is in every scene in the movie, that makes him so intriguingly watchable? It is the creepy acknowledgment that it is just such a nondescript, seemingly harmless, even likeable person who can contain such a world of evil within. ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" ""Still waters run deep."" The movie also investigates the theme of ""the banality of evil,"" a topic that gained credence after the Nuremburg trials. Seemingly average people, with relatively benign upbringing and background, who are nevertheless capable of the most inhumane acts and who go about performing their atrocities in the most calm and matter-of-fact manner.
  Van Siegert is indeed the Angel of Death. His acts are more often than not entirely random. There is no prerequisite as far as the selection precess goes. If you happen to cross his path at a particular matrix in time, you will be amongst the chosen. Captain of the football team, heroin addict, a complete stranger in a diner. It could be you.
  Owen Wilson, with his boyish, broken nosed surfer looks and his goofy smile, is the perfect vehicle for this unforgettable character. The rest of the cast is splendid, but Brian Cox (the Albert Finney look-alike) is particularly adroit at pulling off a bravura turn as the manic-depressive head of the Durwin household that welcomes Siegert into their fold. This Emmy-winning actor should have been up for an Oscar for his work in this film.
  One of the really intriguing things about this movie is the fact that, according to the IMDB, it marks the directorial debut of Hampton Fancher, previously best known as the script writer for Blade Runner. The guy has obviously been around a while and knows how to set up a scene and how to get great performances out of a cast. A most impressive debut, indeed.

Owen Wilson does a great job as the pleasant, all American drifter. Friendly, polite and genuinely absorbed by the world around him. Oh, and he's insane.
Much of the film uses voice over for Vann's thought processes. He kills with the minimum cruelty needed. He has no interest in hurting others and thinks he is doing his victims a favor by removing them from life's burdens. He is at times as innocent as a child.
Played out over several killings and inner conflict we see on screen Vann is loathsome and likeable at the same time. He is scary because he could be your friendly next door neighbor. He could have a freezer of trophies although Minus Man is not very violent. Instead it is meditative in it's narrative with good acting by Wilson.
There is a bleak humor beneath the surface of Minus Man. All characters are exceptionally well acted with confident and laconic direction. Wilson is completely believable in this complex role.
Minus Man is the kind of film you can watch several times and enjoy the nuiance of the performances, the simple and often prosaic situations that add to the tension of a well intentioned mass murderer. When will Vann be compelled to take a life, is he capable of sparing someone when his feelings get in the way?

There is an interaction between Vann and the Durwins that really identifies this character...I wish I could say more, but I don't want to give away any of the story....basically it identifies how removed - emotionally - Vann is from society...including those you think he truelly cares about.

 THE MINUS MAN reminds me of another study of a killer's mind, TAXI DRIVER. But where Travis Bickle will never ""fit in,"" will always go against the tide and be rejected by others, Vann blends into social circumstances and is apparently accepted by society. In many cases, people actually gravitate to his character and reach out to him.
But he has an empty heart.
 Travis Bickle's heart is filled with rage and violence that explodes outward in vengeful murder.
But Vann seems to just suck the life out of his victims, more an implosion of emptiness and despair. When someone tries to ""move in closer,"" there's just a vacuum. Look in his eyes when Ferrin tries to get past the surface chit-chat and become more intimate. His eyes are empty. He just shuts down.
 Both men seem so different on the surface. But their deadly reactions are to the same problem-  the inability to ""only connect"" to their fellow man. With thanks to Forster.
 ""Only connect!... Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die.""
 How much Vann and Travis are like each other- their spartan, monk-like daily existences marked by the occaisonal emergence of ""the beast.""
Stunning lead performance by Owen Wilson, as well as a finely tuned cast.
 The music is an important reflection of the key ideas in this film, rather than just a tacked-on score.

Day by Day Van narrates his thoughts permiting a glimpse into the killers psyche.  Owen Wilson isn't the typical brutal serial killer.  His method is passive.  Each victim as you will see flows toward there death. It's an ok film.  It was somewhat interesting.  The DVD contains nothing of great importance.  Picture quality is relaxed.

1071133,4,6305770182,"For those who like unconventional zest in their films, ""The Minus Man"" should make for an interesting cup of tea, depending on how far your patience will take you. The movie is careful not to journey down familiar territory, creating an atmosphere of dread and surreal intensity that manages to engage the audience by preparing them for a big event that never comes. Those put off by ambiguous endings should look elsewhere, but the sequence of events leading up to these loose ends is effectively creepy, and sometimes disturbing.
The film begins by introducing us to Vann (Owen Wilson), traveling across the country in search of something never made clear even to him, much less to the viewer. As he drifts from one place to another, poisoning people with his tainted amaretto flask, he ponders his actions, his thoughts serving as narration throughout various points in the film. He is methodical rather than meticulous: there is no master plan to his crimes, just a simple acceleration of someone's downward spiral towards their not-too-distant end, like an angel of death making his next house call.
What is most unsettling about this character is his sublime ability to keep mum about his actions; in reality, he is a kind and thoughtful man with a little business on the side to take care of every now and then. His arrival in a small town leads him to rent a room from Doug and Jane Durwin (Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl), who seem to be having problems with their marriage, possibly as a result of the absence of their daughter; the movie makes the mistake of not expanding on this tension.
As Vann makes his way around town, picking up a job as a postal worker and making nice with the locals, he picks up where he left off before his arrival, silently claiming the lives of the town's star high school football player, a man aggravated by noisy children in the local hash joint, all the while getting deeper into the lives of his landlords and developing a friendship with coworker Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo).
I must say that I was very impressed with this film's casting choices, and their favorable talent. Wilson, who is always a delight to watch despite the material, employs his natural charm and winning smile into the role of Vann, playing him as the all-around nice guy while also evoking a cold sense of doom in his hidden undertakings. Just as he so grandly masks his character's actions, Cox, Ruehl and Garofalo are equally impressive as those closest to him, playing their characters' obliviousness to Vann's true nature convincingly enough that the sense of unease is heightened even more.
And if this weren't enough, director Hampton Fancher, who also adapted the novel on which the film is based, has a real knack for increasing the suspense at a rate that becomes almost unbearable. As things begin to fall apart for Vann, from the discovery of the poison in the bodies of three victims, to the foreboding presence of FBI officials in the area, the question of whether or not he will be revealed becomes much more intriguing.
As with most films of this sort, this one steps wrong by leaving one of its two mysteries to the viewer's opinion, when it is better off solved. It involves the murder of Jane Durwin, with the suspicion pointing to Mr. Durwin; Doug seems to know just how the police will react to his alibi of going to the dentist on the day of the murder, fearing that police will conclude that he borrowed Vann's truck to follow his wife and do away with her. But was he responsible for her murder? The absence of their rumored quarreling, as well as Vann's presence, leaves this an open-ended case.
The second mystery is the film's ending, which, again, leaves us no easy answers or standard thriller showdowns or comeuppances. In a way, this is as it should be; that the movie ends on a note of ambiguity provides for one final chord of tension, a sense of unease that may not be what we expected from the extreme buildup of suspense prior to the conclusion, but is nonetheless brooding. At one point, Vann makes the examination, ""I like the detail of a thing, especially if it has a purpose."" ""The Minus Man"" may not have much purpose to it, but it's catchy, and effectively chilling.",1010620800,9,4223,4.692722371967655
1071134,4,6305770182,"Pretty good film about a serial killer, yet the film has no violence. That's what I like about it, although I love mnay violent driven serial killer films it's nice to see a very different take on one. Plus I like to see Own Wilson, the usual sidekick comedian do something offbeat and artistic. A great quote from the film is done by Wilson: ""When I was a kid I was laying on the ground, and a spider crawled in my ear. Then he crawled out,... nobody home.""",1004659200,3,458,4.215909090909091
1071135,4,6305770182,"I must say that I had no idea what this movie would be like but found myself pleasantly surprised by both the story and the central perfomances.
A young drifter by the name of Vann Siegert wanders into a small coastal town and slowly people in the town begin to disappear - it's no plot spoiler to say that Vann is the man causing these disappearances - we do see the movie through his eyes. He possesses a disarming charm and kindness that people feel they can trust him, most notably his landlord Doug followed by his wife Jane and his co-worker at the Post Office, Ferrin. Slowly things begin to change and tension builds as Vann ensures that his cover is not blown.
While this probably doesn't sound too different from your average serial killer yarn, it is made more believable by spot on performances. Owen Wilson is a revelation as the drifter Vann, with the charm of a Tom Ripley, his drawling voice and easy smile, not once suggesting a killer behind it. Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl are both excellent as Vann's landlords, with Ruehl just topping Cox with a lovely understated performance not overshadowed by Cox's occasional histrionics. Finally, rounding out the main cast is Janene Garofolo, as Ferrin, and she nails her role as the co-worker who hopes for romance perfectly.
The distraction of Vann's hallucinations don't work that well but this is a minor discrepancy in an otherwise excellent film. With his work on this movie and scene-stealing turns in such movies as the otherwise awful ""The Haunting"", and ""Meet the Parents"", Wilson certainly shows he is capable of much more.",996364800,17,1596,4.765342960288809
1071136,4,6305770182,"Hampton Fancher has chose an unusual, laid-back angle in this slowly paced portrait of a serial killer -- from the very first scene, we are treated to some unusual views of ordinary objects, a hint of the mood of the story that follows.
Rather than shoot this as a standard whodunit, Fancher lets us see the events through the eyes and the mind of his odd but likeable protagonist, Vann Siegert -- played with an almost distracted reserve by Owen Wilson.  We know from the very start that Vann is a killer -- in this case, a serial poisoner of strangers -- the suspense lies in wondering when or if he will take that one careless chance that allows the authorities to nail him.  The seemingly slightly simple-minded Vann is very adept at making others comfortable in his presence, at fitting into situations and engendering almost immediate trust among those with whom he interacts.  He rolls into town, finds an apartment, becomes gently friendly with his landlords (they even seem to feel protective of him), lands a job, impresses his boss and his co-workers -- and lights a spark of romantic interest in a fellow-employee, Ferrin, played with very realistic vulnerability by Janeane Garofalo.  There's something about Ferrin that makes her reach out to this man -- we can feel it, but it's never articulated.
  The thing that makes this film so terrifying is exactly this normalcy -- Vann could easily be your neighbor, the kid who mows your lawn...or the mailman.  It'll make you look at little closer at the people you think you know.
  The voice-over narration from Vann is very effective in letting the audience see his deeds from his own perspective, and in revealing how his mind works.  Far from coming across as an evil psychopath, he's almost a sympathetic character here -- he sees himself as helping the people he kills.
  Another effective device is that involving the two detectives who are 'on his case', interrogating him from time to time, trying to get him to crack.
  All in all, the film is well-written and skillfully directed, with some fine work by the cast.  It had to be tricky to handle this story in this way and still make it interesting, maintaining the vague tension that fills it.  Nice work, and entertaining.",992995200,3,2244,4.75968992248062

""The minus man"" is surely a serial killer movie, but with a very slow and peculiar rhythm. It is about a kind and gentle guy, Vann Siegert (owen wison), who moves to a small town, gets a job at the post office, and a room at a couple's house. He is the kind of person you can talk to, or even work with, without noticing he is a killer. However, he is not violent and kills using some poison, which he puts in the victim's food or simply offer it as a beverage.
This movie is very interesting, because it shows that even the good persons have a dark side hidden somewhere, and in some cases, they cannot control it. Please pay attention to the dialogue scenes between the killer and some imaginary detectives, who keep questioning his crimes.

1071153,3,6305770182,"An unassuming, charismatic personality and a bottle of poison prove to be a lethal combination in ""The Minus Man,"" directed by Hampton Fancher and starring Owen Wilson.  When a personable young man drifts in from the Pacific Northwest and settles in a small coastal town, a number of people's lives are soon changed forever, and not for the better.  Vann Siegert (Wilson) is a likable fellow with a winning smile and always a credible story regarding who he is, where he's been and where he's going; he's also a psychotic killer who chooses his victims seemingly at random, yet is so ingratiating that he never falls under suspicion.  And such is the case when he rents a room from an unsuspecting couple, Jane and Doug Durwin (Mercedes Ruehl and Brian Cox).  Without realizing, of course, that he's enabling a murderer, Doug helps Vann find gainful employment, allowing him to establish himself within the community, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.  In one of the more telling scenes in the film, Vann reflects to himself, ""If it weren't for me, these people would all be doing something else today...""  What they are doing, in fact, is searching for one of their own who has gone missing, courtesy of Vann.  What is so distressing about this movie is the lack of menace outwardly presented by someone so intrinsically evil; like Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" Vann is simply too unprepossessing and benign to be considered a threat to anyone.  The contrast between his countenance and his crimes is chilling; and the fact that he perpetrates his deeds in such a matter-of-fact, unemotional manner gives new meaning to the phrase ""cold blooded killer.""  One of the interesting aspects of the film is that Vann acts as narrator as well, which effectively puts the audience inside the mind behind the madness, even more so than in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" because in this case, the viewer is privy to the actual thought process that precipitates the crimes.  And it becomes a bit unnerving after some reflection upon what is actually transpiring under the guise of ""normalcy.""  Owen Wilson is well cast and gives a stunningly credible performance as Vann; he conveys such a low-keyed, eye-in-the-center-of-the-storm manner that he is instantly recognizable as the boy next door you'd be more than happy for your daughter to date.  And after watching him in action it becomes truly disconcerting to consider that in the real world there are those who look and act like Vann and are capable of such heinous acts of violence and deceit.  As the couple who takes Vann in-- and are subsequently taken in by him-- Ruehl and Cox capture the essence of the ""everyman/woman"" that can be found in any neighborhood in any town, and the fact that they are people with whom it is so easy to identify makes it even more upsetting when you realize that the vulnerability to which we are all prone can be exploited with such facility.  In a supporting role, Janeane Garofalo is a welcome presence as Ferrin, a co-worker of Vann's who is drawn in by his winsome facade; and rounding out the supporting cast are Sheryl Crowe (Caspar/Laurie), Dwight Yoakam (Blair), Dennis Haysbert (Graves) and Alex Warren (State Trooper).  Ultimately, ""The Minus Man"" is a cautionary tale that may spark a touch of paranoia in the viewer, and with good reason; and after spending some time with Vann, it just may alter your perception of some of your more casual acquaintances and even some old friends, especially those who seem so ""ordinary.""  It's a film that kind of sneaks up on you and takes you by surprise; and it may leave you pondering the darker side of human nature.",982540800,6,3646,4.800319488817891
