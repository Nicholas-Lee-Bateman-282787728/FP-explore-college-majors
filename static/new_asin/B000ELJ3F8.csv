8110849,5,B000ELJ3F8,"I bought this program from Steve's website several weeks ago and have been using it every night before bed, ever since. I do have chronic pain because I am bone on bone between L5 and S1 and have been on prescription meds to control the pain for over the past 6 years. When I started using the program, I enjoyed the peaceful music and beautiful scenery and thought about the messages when they were spoken, but otherwise, let myself get into the peacefulness of the waterfalls and streams. This definitely works for me, because I am noticing myself using fewer and fewer pain pills than I was before. For me, it is more than a ""placebo effect"", because my pain has been severe enough for strong pain meds. I now find myself either halving, quartering or forgetting my pills altogether and not having the constant, bad to severe pain that I had. Now, I realize that everyone's experience will be different, but like I said in my title, this definitely works for me! I have already recommended this and many other of Steve's programs to family, friends and acquaintances and will continue to do so. Thank you so very much, Steve. Your subliminal programs and Reiki programs are very powerful, easy to understand and learn and they work!",1394928000,2,1235,4.669724770642202
8110850,5,B000ELJ3F8,"Recently while searching for some music, I came across Steve Murray's DVD programs for attunement. First impression was that, this must be fake. As it was in total contradiction to the learning's I learnt during my Reiki 2nd degree in India. I went on to read the reviews and none of the reviews were negative. All people including some Reiki masters were in praises for Steve's program. I took the chance and ordered his first book, 1st cd and DVD attunement for 2nd degree. I wanted to take this again for reinforcement and to give my wife 2nd degree who was a 1st degree. (My intention was to try his claim first before I venture into a master attunement of Reiki through DVD)

 Last week I received the dvd and the first thing was to play the dvd to see myself, if it works. It did work. It was a very powerful attunement & I received it all through a DVD, isn't it amazing.. Immediately after that my wife took the attunement and she also felt extreme heat and tingling sensation. Now she is a 2nd degree and her Reiki is flowing beautifully. The first line of his book, which says ""I believe at this very moment as you read this, our vibrations and energies are connected in the now"". As soon as I read this I felt I am connected to Steve. When I played his attunement cd part 1, I felt a gentle shower of Reiki all over me. Its playing right now and I can feel Reiki all around me. Since then I have taken both 1st & 2nd degree attunements a couple of times and every time I feel an increase in my energy levels. I feel my hearing ability has increased; now I can pick up sounds quite far from me. My smelling ability has increased, my concentration and consciousness has increased too.

 Giving attunements like this proves that Reiki works in past present and future all layered together. This even supports the string theory proposed by Einstein and the 11 dimensions we live in. probably Reiki works in all those 11 dimensions just by our intent. Steve has done a great think to mankind by his video programs. He is in fact a time traveler who travels forward and backwards in time by his Reiki and gives the attunement to us whenever we watch his videos and listen to his cds. His attunements on Dvd cost just 30 whereas taking a master attunement cost $1,000 in India and up to $10,000 in US. He has made Reiki available to the masses virtually at no cost. This way more and more people can use this power and be healed and heal others. Reiki is a free gift from the supreme power and should be available for masses. I honor his Reiki mission which is to spread Reiki to everybody for their betterment.

I also ordered his subliminal programs; currently I am using Quit Smoking and Stress relief. Only 3 days have passed doing these programs. I already feel that my stress levels are going down. The second day I lit the cigarette but I couldn't pull, I felt as if the smoke is killing me. Immediate reaction was to throw the cigarette and now I don't feel like smoking anymore, touchwood. Next weekend I will be taking my master level attunement and I feel so happy about it.

I urge everybody to experience Reiki. It can change your life for good in so many ways. It will heal you on all levels and make your surroundings more pleasant. After some time of continuous use, you will feel that things have started falling back in place on their own. You can go and take a Reiki session from a Reiki healer or try ""Reiki 1st Level Attunement - Become a Reiki Healer (2004)"" by Steve Murray. Any of the options will not cost you more then 30 - 40 bucks and you can experience the divine power of Reiki. It's such a nice experience to feel life sustaining force flowing through your body at your wish and you can direct it anywhere you like, even heal a living being. From there it will depend on your fate and your karma. But at least let your body experience it once. I can bet that this might be the best investment you can ever make in your entire life.

8110851,3,B000ELJ3F8,"This DVD is only 20 min long with a on screen written & narrated 6 min intro about what subliminal is, how it & the unconscious mind works & how to use this program everyday for 30 days. They also remind you that subliminal messages are everywhere in advertising used to get us to buy their products.
I was apprehensive at first, worrying they too can add a nefarious message as well. As I watched a series of waterfalls with babbling water & light music, I did breathe deeper a few times & relaxed.
Since I've only watched it three times since getting it & two times I had a headache & it was only 10-20% better, I'm not sure it works. I'm not in any chronic pain or have any diseases *knock on wood* so I can't say it has helped in those areas.
It could also just be a placebo effect which means it helps one to heal themselves which we are all capable of. If it works like that, then it's worth it, but hasn't really for me. I will change this review if I do have any significant improvements.
Steve Murray who is a Reiki Master & also has a series of Reiki DVDs at healingreiki also makes this.",1147996800,4,1098,4.15962441314554
