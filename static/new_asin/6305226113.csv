7885342,5,6305226113,"The two-reel comedies that Charlie Chaplin made during his one-year contract with the Mutual Film Corporation are considered his best shorts.  Having been offered $500,000 from Essanay to stay, Chaplin signed with Mutual for $10,000 a week for one year and a $150,000 signing bonus.  More important, Mutual gave Chaplin virtually complete control over his shorts as writer, director, and star.  It was during this period that Chaplin refined his filmmaking techniques and set the stage for moving on to longer and better films, from ""A Dog's Life"" and ""The Kid"" to his silent feature films such as ""The Gold Rush"" and ""Modern Times.""

Fortunately Kino started restoring Chaplin's work with both Essanay and Mutual, tracking down the best surviving 35mm negatives, digitally mastering the prints to clean them up, and then adding re-orchestrated musical scores. ""The Chaplin Mutuals, Volume 1"" actually offers the last four of the dozen two-reelers Chaplin did for Mutual, all of which were released in 1917 and all of which co-starred Edna Purviance as the Tramp's leading lady and had Eric Campbell in the role of the heavy:

""The Immigrant"" (Released June 17, 1917) is arguably the best of Chaplin's shorts.  He filmed 24 hours of footage over two months to produce a 21-minute film when most two-reelers were shot in two days.  When Chaplin began, filming the restaurant scene (with Campbell as the head waiter), the film was going to be about the bohemian life, but the scene was too short and he decided to make the Tramp and the young girl immigrants, creating the opening sequence on the boat and the happy ending.  Starting with the simple gag of the Tramp leaning over the ship's railing turning out to be something other than what we think, ""The Immigrant"" is classic Chaplin.

""Easy Street"" (January 22, 1917) would be my choice for the second best of the Chaplin Mutuals.  Reformed by Edna, the Missionary's daughter, Chaplin plays a cop whose beat is a wretched slum area, hence the irony of the title.  There is a short but intricate chase scene before Edna is kidnapped by a dope addict and has to be rescued by Charlie.  On the one hand there is lots of slapstick in this one, but you also have a depiction of urban poverty and violence that is a bit unsettling if you can stop laughing long enough to think about what you are seeing.

""The Adventurer"" (October 22, 1917), the last of the films Chaplin did for Mutual, has him Chaplin a convict who escapes after a lengthy chase scene and end up rescuing not only the lovely Edna, but her mother and obnoxious fiance.  Hailed as a hero, and presumed to be a wealthy yachtsman as is so often the case in these comedies, Charlie is invited to a dinner party at the Judge's mansion where it is just a question of time before his true identity is revealed.

""The Cure"" (April 16, 1917) has Chaplin as a wealthy inebriate who is trying to dry out at a sanitarium where once again the lovely Edna catches his eye.  If you have ever seen a clip from this one it is probably Chaplin's comic use of the revolving door and the poor guy with the gouty foot.  The big joke is that the supply of booze he has brought in a trunk to survive the experience of sobering up ends up being dumped into the mineral spring, which makes for a lot of happy people in the end.

With ""The Immigrant"" and ""Easy Street"" this collection offers two of the very best of Charlie Chaplin's two-reelers.  If, for some reason you wanted to only pick up one of the three volumes in this set then this would definitely be the one.  But I think the whole set is worthwhile, certainly superior to everything Chaplin did with Keystone and Esssanay and clearly setting the stage for what would follow.  I had a class once where I showed one work from each of the five periods of Chaplin's career, defined by the studio he worked for, to show how he progressed from simple reelers like ""The Fatal Mallet"" to my favorite, ""City Lights.""",1097712000,5,3959,4.627142857142857
