2525701,3,B000EOTFBW,"I understand director Michael Winterbottom's points about the nature of filming such an unfilmable film.  What his film eventually becomes is a mildly funny film about filmmakers trying to make a film out of a book that is eventually unfilmable.  The plot, or lack thereof, is strangely convoluted, yet part of me was drawn in to it.  The characters play multiple roles (Steve Coogan has three) and trying to figure this film out was a feat of its own.  All of the characters play fictional ""themselves"" (Steve Coogan plays a fictional actor named Steve Coogan) and it is extremely interesting and often times funny.  The fictional Steve Coogan plays the part of Tristram Shandy, and he is also chosen to play Walter Shandy, Tristram's father, who is essentially Tristram with a grey wig.  Rob Brydon is hysterical in this film, playing ""himself"" and Toby Shandy, Tristram's uncle.  The first half of the film is absolutely hysterical, focusing on the confusing details of Tristram's birth.  The second half, however, draws the film down, sometimes into the territory of boring.  There are some good supporting performances, including Naomie Harris, playing Jennie, a love interest of the married ""Steve Coogan"".  It's also important to note that ""Steve's"" wife in the film (played wonderfully by the striking Kelly Macdonald) shares the same name, only spelled ""Jenny"".  It is also important for me to say that I have never read ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"" by English novelist Laurence Sterne, so my review may be a bit off for those of you who have read the novel.  Critics like Roger Ebert (whom I greatly respect and read regularly) and A.O. Scott of the New York Times (whom I also respect) have hailed this film as a masterpiece, and all I can say is ""Sorry"".  I understand what Michael Winterbottom was going for in this film, and as hard as I tried to get into it, it didn't fully appeal to me.  That is not to say that it is not a good film, I just did not like it as much as I should have.  I have the utmost respect for the filmmakers and the actors participating in this film, and I give the three stars to them.  The two stars that they didn't get was not their fault, but merely a matter of taste.  I would have liked to see more of the Tristram character, but it would have conflicted with the idea of it being unfilmable.",1152489600,3,2363,4.641826923076923
2525702,5,B000EOTFBW,"Forget most of what you've read about this movie. It is not postmodern, nor ""Pythonesqe"", nor any of the other adjectives I've read in user reviews. What it is is a very intelligent, and very different piece of filmmaking that is quite unlike anything you've ever seen. If I had to compare it to any movie in recent history, I'd say it's a bit like ""Adaptation"", but that film was crude and heavy handed in comparison to ""Tristram Shandy"". It's also a bit like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" in the deadpan way it presents some very silly parody.

Imagine a Merchant-Ivory costume drama in which the principal actor suddenly stops, turns to the camera, and tells a Groucho Marx story, And imagine that part way through an increasingly confusing narrative, that keeps movinng forward and back, in fits and starts, the camera abruptly pulls back, and we see a film being made.

From that point on, ""Tristram"" becomes the story of the attempt to make a film from a very difficult to film novel, with a very difficult cast. The lead hasn't read the book, and is consumed with petty jealosies concerning the main supporting actor. The producers don't want to put any more money into it. And it just gets sillier, and sillier- while never quite falling into slapstick.

In point of fact, as conditions around the film get sillier, the lives of the main characters become more complicated, and consumed by some very serious issues. And yet everything slowly comes togethers, a few people learn a few lessons, and a film is made... although no one seems to ber very pleased with the results. And then, as the credits are rolling, the two main actors are debating acting techniques, in what may be the funniest scene of the entire film.

So what we have here is a very complex film that requires close attention, and perhaps even a little knowledge of literature and history to get all the jokes. This is not simple minded slapstick, and those who prefer that sort of humor simply aren't going to get it. But for veiwers who bring with them the intelligence to apppreciate all the jokes and references, it delivers a very satisfying and laughter filled two hours.",1145145600,70,2144,4.679045092838196
2525703,3,B000EOTFBW,"Michael Winterbottom's ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" is a film about filming the unfilmable--in this case, Laurence Sterne's famously discursive novel of the same name. The film is delightful as long as it concentrates on the film, less so when--about halfway through--it changes focus to concentrate on the filmmakers. Star Steve Coogan and his pal Rob Brydon set up enormous expectations at the beginning, sitting in their makeup chairs and carrying on a dialogue that's as hilarious as anything in the collected works of Christopher Guest or Larry David. The film then turns to a straight-as-possible film version of the Sterne novel, and is totally engrossing for the next half-hour. But then Jeremy Northam, playing the director, yells ""CUT!"" and the whole thing becomes just another dullish satire of blinkered, self-centered show-biz folk. Coogan and Brydon are still funny playing exaggerated versions of themselves, but the rest of it--including a long gambit about negotiating with Gillian Anderson to get her to appear in the film--is a big, fat yawn. Actors, producers and directors are never as fascinating as they think they are, and though movie critics can't get enough of movie moguls mocking themselves, rank-and-file audiences rightfully disagree. (These are the same shoals on which Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" another absurdly overpraised film, was wrecked.) I'd love to see Coogan and Brydon again, but as for ""Tristram Shandy,"" it's the archetypal curate's egg: Parts of it are excellent, and not the bigger parts, either.",1142899200,4,1558,5.337398373983739
2525704,4,B000EOTFBW,"This movie is not for everyone -- I was completely enthralled while my boyfriend was falling asleep -- (no really, I had to keep poking him to keep him from snoring).  I however found it to be fascinating, with a multi-layered story line, and some hilarious sequences to round it out.  If you enjoy watching the behind the scenes features on your DVDs, you will enjoy this movie.  It shows the drama that goes on behind the scenes, like trying to get funding to re-shoot portions of the film, and the buereacracy involved in every step of the process. The movie also has several stories running through it. There is the story of the Tristram Shandy film itself, then there is the struggle by actor Steve Coogler to accept his new family and lifestyle while trying to overcome his past career moves. There is also a rather funny rivalry between two of the main actors in the Shandy movie.  As I said above this is not for everybody, if you have a hard time following a british accent, you may miss a lot, as well as if you are completely unfamiliar with british culture and slang. If this is not a concern, you may find that Tristram Shandy is a breath of fresh air. If you are bored with all the typical stuff out there, this is something entirely new.",1142208000,5,1252,4.430434782608696
2525705,5,B000EOTFBW,"Brilliant modern take on an early novel. The director captures the premise of the novel: that life is chaos by setting the film in the past and present at once. Brilliant concept and execution. I didn't know what to expect, but thoroughly enjoyed the film and it's cleverness, it's inspired direction and editing and some stellar performances. A joy to watch.",1141603200,15,359,4.901639344262295
2525706,3,B000EOTFBW,"The unpredictable director Michael Winterbottom here helms this peculiar film which has quite a few moments of hilarity, but just as many or more of dragginess. In it, Steve Coogan, the British actor, plays himself, as does basically everyone else, in the ""story"" of the filming of Laurence Sterne's 18th century novel Tristram Shandy.

Thus is not really a filming of the novel, but instead a film that bends over backwards to be totally, like, post-modern. In other words, the actors in the film, including Gillian Anderson--who flies over from Canada to the UK to do her bit as the Widow Something-or-other--once in a while are seen in scenes from the actual film Tristram Shandy but more often than not are shown relating to each other in various ways that often makes the viewer yawn. For example, will there be a battle scene in the film or not? Will the guys responsible for staging the battle scene do what they are supposed to do? Will Steve Coogan manage to escape the press printing some scandalous piece about him shacking up with some babe in a one-night stand, thereby ruining his ongoing relationship with Jenny, who's shown with her and Steve's baby for much of the film? Will the other Jenny, a beautiful black production assistant, intrude on Steve's love life with his own Jenny?

While the funny stuff is really funny, there is not enough of it to counterbalance the humdrum material. Most of the hilarious bits come with Steve trading quips and counter-quips with fellow actor Rob Brydon who is just as funny as Steve, if not more so. The two of them are great together and this is what the film should have spent more time on. But, for example, the entire sequence of whether the battle scene guys will do what they are supposed to do, is a deadly bore, as is a lot of the talk about production of the film itself.

Tellingly, some of the funniest stuff comes at the very beginning of the film when Rob Brydon is asking Steve Coogan about the color of his teeth, and then at the very end during the end credits, when each of them does his own interpretation of Al Pacino, sounding very different indeed.

This is a unique film, no question. But the director, who appears in the film as himself (as well as all the actors) appears to have bitten off more than he could chew in attempting to put together a so-called 'post-modern' version of the filming of what is termed an unfilmable novel. In trying so hard to make the film post-modern, he has made it noticeably inconsistent and thus somewhat tough to sit through.

Good for the funny stuff; otherwise, not.",1140912000,3,2582,4.616557734204793
2525707,3,B000EOTFBW,"few years back I sat through a weird movie called CQ. It was this film about a visionary young director making a crappy movie. It was about the creative spark that hit people even if the outcome is complete dreck. That movie came back to me while sitting through TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY.

SHANDY is a kind of mockumentary/period drama about a real actor named Steve Coogan. He's a big star in Britain (really!). He's stars in the film within the film as the lead character Tristram Shandy. The film is based on a popular British novel called The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. It's a huge novel that will be impossible to film, so of course they do. It also follows Coogan the actor whose life is as chaotic. But to try to sum up the story would be impossible except to say that it's a story about the creative process and the toll it takes on one man and the people around him. Plus Gillian Anderson has a cameo.

Yet it's funny. In a British way. Not being aware of much in British humor (except for Monty Python) I missed a lot of jokes. There was a women behind me in the theater that laughed a lot. But except for her this theater was filled with old people and they didn't for the most part make a peep so I'm not quite sure how effective the movie is, but I laughed a little. I especially like the scene with the gigantic birth canal with fallopian tubes that they lowered Coogan into upside down.

Yes I will admit the film was a little over my head. Not that I couldn't follow it. I just wondered if their was something more I needed to get. Was there a piece of dialogue that I couldn't quite decipher? I left the movie having seen it but amazingly I forgot most of what I had seen after I left the theater, well except for the giant birth canal.

All this to say, that I would like to watch this film again sometime. With other people, and maybe as a group we could figure out if there was some deeper meaning other than that life is chaotic and tragic and our life stories are interesting even if we never get passed how we were born. Even this review is interesting, if kind of random. I apologize for that. Please somebody go see this movie and tell me what I'm missing. Because I liked it, and yet I'm not sure it hit me quite the way I was expecting.

One wonders if this review is not a COCK AND BULL STORY on its own . It is as if the way this film was shot and edited together has effected the very way I will interpret cinema forever or maybe I'm just a crazy man who needs to be locked up. Please break me from this misery because I'm at a loss to quite explain the film and yet if you were standing near me I might be able to rattle on for 25 minutes about what the film was about. Hmm... I've never quite felt this way before.

All this to say I recommend this film and yet am unable to put the film into any real place. Go see it you'll understand.",1140825600,4,2905,4.141843971631205

2525715,5,B000EOTFBW,"I found this film to be hilarious.  It is first and foremost a comedy about making a movie based upon the life of Tristram Shandy in the 17th century. But it is great fun and highly entertaining.  I must admit it is not typical main-stream humor from the USA but is the more subtle, ironic, understated humor from Great Britain. Steve Coogan is great in the lead role as himself as an actor taking the lead in this mismanaged production while trying to balance rivals, directors, assistants, a girlfriend with a new baby.  Steve Coogan is superb as he displays all his human weaknesses and vulnerabilities and petty concerns. Steve is tortured by his co-star, played perfectly by Rob Brydon, and their rivalry is so funny that I found myself bursting out laughing at their interactions. Brydon is perfect as a character actor who has an instinct for finding the vanity, insecurity, character weaknesses of the leading actor, played by Coogan, and exploiting them in a relentlessly persistent manner. All of the actors are shown as themselves and as the parts they play in the film. The entire cast was outstanding and of the highest quality. Keeley Hawes, Shirley Henderson and Kelly Macdonald are all great. Shirley Henderson with her odd little voice and facial characteristics and gait is always on top of her game as she is here playing the role of the Shandy maid in the film they are trying to produce. Jerem Northam, Stephen Fry, and Greg Wise are all exceptional talents playing supporting roles in this film which makes it just that much more rich. Gillian Anderson plays herself as the big star brought in to add an entire romantic theme to the film and she is such a good sport even when she sees the final product is not up to expectations. Naomie Harris is outstanding in her role as an assistant to the lead actors who has an obsession with film history as well as with Steve Coogan. Kelly Macdonald has had multiple exposures in new films lately including the fantastic job she does in No Country for Old Men, but here she shows she can also play a supporting role with understatement.

This comedy is about human frailty, weaknesses, vanities, ambitions, priorities, and foolishness.  It succeeds magnificently.",1389139200,3,2227,4.7890625
2525716,1,B000EOTFBW,"Dull story with English funny man Steve Coogan about making a movie of the unfilmable novel, Tristam Shandy. Had one sort of laugh in 95 minutes of film. It reminded me of the old saw that anyone who loves the law or sausage should never see them made. Lots of fine performers and attractive production can't hide the fact that it's boring and that those who said the novel is unfilmable have yet to be proved wrong. This is one of those movies that must have sounded great in the pitch to the money men...if they were on something. only movie I can remember where the show a full diaper change...in living color.

2525717,1,B000EOTFBW,"Although I admire the intention of this movie, its execution is ruined for me by its very annoying stars and a director who indulges their excesses.

Evidently there are people in addition to Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon who think they're adorable, but I don't. Their pretentious banter drives me up the wall, and even when apart each man is irritating, not cute. I forced myself to get past the extremely stupid opening scene, when they dig at each other while being made up for their roles in the Shandy movie, but their personalities dominate this movie to such an extent that I had to quit watching after a while.

I made the mistake a year or two ago of renting a movie in which the same two actors play themselves traveling around contemporary England together for some reason that I don't remember and don't want to remember. I don't even want to remember that movie's title. Unfortunately for me, I also didn't remember their names, so I didn't realize until I got the DVD that this movie stars the same two very annoying actors.

2525720,3,B000EOTFBW,"I was recently watching some Michael Winterbottom movie, and after checking on some of his other movies, I fell upon this one, based on a novel that was/is considered to be 'unfilmable'. That of course piqued my interest and so I checked it out.

""Tristam Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" (2005 relased from the UK; 94 min.) follows around actor Steven Coogan playing himself (as a less likeable version of the real him), playing the main character of the Tristam Shandy novel being made into a movie. Did you get that? In other words, there isn't much of a plot. The initial one-third centers mostly around the birth of Tristam (and Coogan as taking up the role of Tristam's dad), but then we transition to a movie-within-a-movie as we see the set people interact with the main characters. At some point Coogan (playing the less likeable Coogan version of himself) is interviewed by Tony Wilson about the movie being made and after a minute of that, a voice-over announces that ""the full interview of the interview can be viewed as part of the DVD bonus materials"", and to top that off, it actually is! (There are a bunch of DVD bons materials, including indeed the full 15 min. interview of ""Coogan as Coogan"" by Wilson.) And on it goes. It is a challenge to keep track of who is playing whom, and what is really going on.

Couple of comments: I have no trouble with a double or even triple layer of who is playing who or what. At times it would seem to remind of Monthy Python in its extreme absurdism, but this movie did not induce me to laugh or chuckle, I simply watched and stared. While I appreciate the artistic courage to undertake the filming of a novel that's been called 'unfilmable' (I haven't read the novel), I simply could not connect with or get emotionally engaged by this movie.",1359936000,,1796,4.540123456790123

The rest is a bunch of supposedly ad-libed, present day dialog about making the movie, new scripts from America to review, how to shoot scenes, etc.  Dull and boring, and those are complements!  This film was a total disappointment.  Some may think by making the film in this way the movie adds on a layer of irrelevancy to a book that was about irrelevancy.

It came across to me as a flawed attempt at satire.  I enjoy satire, as in PDQ Bach and Spinal Tap.  I know a bit about classical music so I get PDQ Bach.  I know a bit about rock too, so I get Spinal Tap.  I know nothing about Tristram Shandy or Laurence Sterne or British theater/moviemaking so it was hard to get anything out of this mockumentary other than the fact that actors are self-absorbed (who knew?) and that nobody would want to watch a movie about Tristram Shandy (or in my case, about people doing a movie about Tristram Shandy).  Obviously I'm in the minority here, as 90% of the reviews at Rotten Tomatoes were positive.  I have to assume that those reviewers are part of the artsy crowd who have enough of a frame of reference to appreciate what was going on in this story.

2525731,2,B000EOTFBW,"The book Tristram Shandy was thought to be un-filmable. Now I have not read the book, but I understand it to be incredibly non-liner. So despite mixed reviews I gave the DVD a try. I mean ""Pulp Fiction"" made non-liner movies work, why not a period piece? Immediately I was captivated by the film. It freely bounced back and forth between the actor playing Shandy and the character Shandy himself. So that the actor (or is it the actor as Shandy) constantly broke the fourth wall of the film as he took the audience along on the ride of his life. Back and forth we went through time to, Shandy's accidental circumcision, birth, then conception, then birth again. Occasionally the actor, Steve Coogan, would drop the Shandy character all together and walk off set to give an interview about the movie he was in, which of course was Tristram Shandy. All very clever, all very fun and witty.

Then at one point, not quite a third of the way through the film, Coogan drops his Shandy character and never goes back to it. The Tristram Shandy movie is placed far into the background and suddenly the audience is brought completely into the present as an egotistical Coogan struggles with the sorted relationships in his life, his  new son, a movie that seems to be losing direction, and the many journalist that follow him. I kept waiting to go completely back Shandy the movie but it never really arrives except for a small bit of closer at the end. ""Why is this movie called Tristram Shandy?"",  I thought. It's a bit more than misleading. It didn't help that the press promoted this movie as a novelization; all the sound bites and previews relied solely on the first third of the movie.  I could not help but feel as if I had been had.

So how does the remaining two thirds of the movie work? Slow but slightly amusing; however, the comedy is as dry as a dusty martini. Steve Coogan has made a name for himself in the U.K. as a talent comic actor, but his attempt to distance himself from his TV persona may not be fully understood across the Atlantic. If Jerry Seinfeld played Shandy I think the audience would of  ""gotten it"" here in the U.S. You could say that's sad or crass, but the film is basically flawed in the fact that it relies way to heavily on Steve Coogan as an established British actor. It also doesn't help that most of the movie is not what it necessarily claims to be. In it's attempt to find a wider audience with this ambitious film, it instead further alienates itself. There are those out there, I'm sure, who would just love this film. I'm just not one of them.",1199836800,3,2582,4.471337579617835

Like many of these types of films it is amusing but leaves one ultimately unsatisfied as you have the carpet pulled out from you too many times.

My favorites range from Olivia De Haviland in The Heiress to Love Actually and everything in between  (ie: Harry Potter, Star Wars, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood etc etc etc).  Tristam Shandy a cock and bull story was an incomprehensible mess. It was not funny, it was not interesting, it was not touching, amusing, warm or anything one wants from a movie.  Even a nice scare (watch Julie Harris in the original The Haunting for a 1st class scare) is worth ones time but not this disaster of a movie.

  Anyway, forgive me for the aformentioned striped tee shirt warning, I could not help myself.  This might be the worst movie I have seen in quite a while. It was even worse than Eragon and that was BAD.",1176940800,11,863,4.545454545454546
2525734,3,B000EOTFBW,"First, I confess to not having read the novel, although I am familier with some works of the period, the literary style, and the history of that time.  This movie is trying very hard to be something that it is not; which is good comedy. There is a strong effort to have a sardonic humor which seems to fall flat. There seems a bizarre combo here of Monty Python with FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN.  Both syles mix the past with the present, or the on scene off scene moments.  Humor is brought into the realms of the surreal, which can work sometimes, but here it seems to fall flat on its face.

There is too much emphasis on the current day situations of the actors.  Perhaps this is some attempt to match the feelings of the book in some strange way, but I certainly did not get it.  I think the production could have been as witty and sardonic if it had not shown the modern set, but just stuck to the story itself.  I am sure a more satisfying way to portray the unique mood of this novel could have been conveyed to the viewer without the choatic mess we have here.  And where is the epic seige of Namur in 1695?  Wasn't this in the original novel?  This was one of the key seiges of the Dutch wars against Louis XIV in his efforts of expansion.  Too see all these movie people with their off-hand attitudes confirms my views of how history often suffers in their so-called creative hands.  Reminds me of the cute little film with Alan Alda SWEET LIBERTY which also conveys how films distort and twist historical facts around, let alone the spirit of an old novel from the past.

Cinema students might like the production shots, and all the politics invovled on the set, but otherwise there is little to recommend this choatic, messy affair.  You will need something to calm your senses after watching all the confused activity that leads to no where in it.  Not a satisfying movie.",1175644800,2,1884,4.420289855072464
2525735,3,B000EOTFBW,"The classic novel by Laurence Sterne is best described in this movie: ""This is a postmodern novel before there was any modernism to be post about.""

So it sounded pretty disastrous that a film was being adapted from it. Actually, half a film -- the other film is a mockumentary about a film crew desperaately trying to make some kind of movie, out of a book with way too much material. It's wickedly clever, but there's too little Tristram Shandy and too much about the shoes.

While his mother is in labor, a grown Tristram Shandy (Steve Coogan) narrates the backdrop of his life -- his awkward conception, the farcical circumstances of his birth, early penile injury, his uncle's obsessions and (ahem) war wounds, and the circumstances of being named Tristram (and not Trismegistus, which is even worse).

But then we cut to the real world, where a film crew is filming the whole thing. Star Steve Coogan (himself) and director Michael Winterbottom (Jeremy Northam) are struggling to make this novel as true to the spirit of Stern's book as possible. The problem is, there's WAY too much material, and everyone wants different aspects -- love story, battle, his own character -- to stand out as the MAIN part of the story. Will the movie be funny? A sell-out? A big confusing mess?

Filming an unfilmable book is usually either going to be a disaster or a masterpiece -- for the latter, look at ""Lord of the Rings."" But ""Tristram Shandy"" hovers somewhere in the middle, courtesy of its mockumentary storyline, and some pointed mockery of the studio bigwigs.

Basically, the bigwigs interfere and insist on stars -- such as Gillian Anderson, who barely makes it to the final cut -- and hoard money, because the movie is too quirky for their tastes. Meanwhile, the stars quibble about minutiae (like shoe height), and real-life director Michael Winterbottom deliberately blurs the lines of fantasy and reality, letting one seep into another. And it has Coogan in a giant plastic womb.

And there's an extra kudos for the dialogue. Half of it is deliciously witty modern stuff (""The thing is, I can't act..."" ""I know that."" ""... with Gillian Anderson. I have a proper sexual thing for Gillian Anderson. I covet her""), but there's a whole different style for Tristram. He tends to have these faux-serious metafictional monologues, which end up being very funny (""That is a child actor, pretending to be me. I'll be able to play myself later"").

The problem? Well, there's too much of Coogan and not enough Shandy, especially in the second half. It would have improved the movie dramatically to cut some of this stuff about Coogan flirting with Jennie out, because it's really quite dull compared to Tristram. When the fantasy/reality starts leaning too heavily into reality, the movie starts sagging. Big time.

Coogan does a pretty good job playing himself, but he's much better as Tristram/Walter -- arch, wry and kind of inconsiderate. Rob Brydon is enormous fun as himself/Toby, and Naomie Harris is fairly good as a movie nut who specializes in arty German cinema, and not much else. Anderson isn't in the movie for long, but her ""equipment"" scene is gutsplittingly funny.

""Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story"" is a very funny film, but one bogged down by too much reality (and Coogan). Entertaining, witty and strange.",1174262400,5,3327,4.863957597173145
2525736,5,B000EOTFBW,"The ads for this film show Steve Coogan in period costume sitting in a director's chair with a cell phone in his hand and wearing trainers. That willful mix of past and present should be a dead give away. Laurence Sterne's post-modern novel (written as we are told well before the modern novel) finds its way to the screen as a kind of making-of documentary often found on DVDs. Coogan addresses the audience much as Sterne does, telling the life story of Tristram Shandy and discovering that the events of life proceed forward faster than you can possibly record them. And since identifying first causes requires moving backward rather than forward in time, any expectations of narrative can be frustrated even further. We get to witness the title character's conception, his birth (numerous times), his christening, and a rather ugly incident from his childhood involving a window sash and a tender body part.

Much of the rest of the film, in modern dress, concerns the cast and supposed crew of the film being made - Jeremy Northam playing a slick director and Kelly Macdonald as Coogan's long-suffering girlfriend with a perpetually squalling baby. The off-camera debates and struggles over the direction of the film provide the chief dramatic conflict, and it is not incidental. The film even starts in make-up where Coogan gets a false nose while arguing with co-star Rob Brydon over the nature of the credit he should be getting. Coogan's droll and earnest persona, delivered often in a kind of confused, pained deadpan, is fun to watch, and the chaotic process of film-making calls to mind other films of the genre, e.g., Truffaut's ""Day For Night."" Good fun, but don't expect too much of Laurence Sterne.",1174262400,,1714,4.930795847750865
2525737,5,B000EOTFBW,"Reactions to this ""production"" of Tristram Shandy will vary as much as individuals vary.  I enjoyed it and found it witty and very funny.  But I love Finnegans Wake.  Most don't.

That reminds me of John Cage's eccentric but fascinating Roaratorio, an adaptation of Finnegans Wake using selected sounds, noises, even, from the locations covered in the Wake.

Of course this type of project is very far from the type of straightforward representations of feelings, scenes, stories, characters, etc. which most people require.

What I enjoyed about this crazy film is the fine acting, the brilliant juxtaposition of its own elements, the absurdity of most of it.  E.G., they have a huge battle scene which they barely use in the film plus a big star, Gillian Anderson, as a widow who hardly appears in the final version.

There is, though, plenty of time for ""cock and bull"" style jokes a fact which follows the novel quite well.  I recommend this film for adventurous viewers.",1173225600,,975,4.896341463414634
2525738,3,B000EOTFBW,"***1/2

Lawrence Sterne's 18th Century novel, ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"" has long been viewed as a largely ""unfilmable"" work due to its enormous length and famously idiosyncratic style. The bawdy, satirical tome, done in the form of a mock-autobiography, originally appeared in nine volumes and broke new artistic ground by employing the kind of stream-of-consciousness narration and self-referential self-awareness that would later come to define the post-modernist style of 20th and 21st Century literature. As one of the characters in the movie exclaims, the ahead-of-its-time ""Shandy"" was already post-modern before modern existed.

The movie, ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story,"" is NOT a version of the novel either but rather a droll, frequently hilarious faux-documentary about one movie crew's valiant but futile attempt to bring this unwieldy literary work to the silver screen. Writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce and director Michael Winterbottom have used Sterne's novel as a mere reference point for their own slashing satire on film-making in general and the adaptation of great novels in particular. Indeed, the movie is as much a tribute to Fellini's ""8 1/2"" - another film about a filmmaker's struggle to complete a challenging movie - as it is to ""Tristram Shandy."" The movie makers even employ Nina Rota's score from that film as background for the action rather than music that would more accurately reflect the period of the story. Talk about post-modern!

Steve Coogan plays himself as the actor hired on to inhabit the roles of both Tristram and his father, Walter, in the film that is being made. Joining him is Rob Brydon, who also plays himself as well as Tristram's uncle, Toby. In the modern scenes, the two are acutely funny as they squabble over how each is to play his respective part and who is to be allotted the most time on screen. However, the best parts of the movie are the scenes re-creating the novel on film, which are done with an anarchic spirit and a freewheeling cleverness that put one in mind of Tony Richardson's ""Tom Jones."" With their raillery and wit, these sequences almost convince us that, given the sufficient resources and the proper talents, maybe a decent movie COULD be made of Sterne's novel (or at least a small part of it) after all.

Some of the film-making sequences are enjoyable as well, zeroing in on the compromises brought about by having to balance budgetary restraints with personal egos. Yet, the movie tends to run out of steam the further away it gets from Sterne's original story. Coogan is amusing as a character when he is focused on the mechanics of his acting, but he's far less interesting when brooding about his troubled relationship with his girlfriend, his role as a new daddy or his contemplation of an affair with his attractive assistant. These scenes, which take up a significant portion of the final act of the movie, wind up draining away much of the cleverness and energy that are found in such abundance during the earlier stretches of the film. Yet, if ""A Cock and Bull Story"" finally dribbles away into insignificance at the end, it still provides us with an hour and a half or so of really hearty laughter as compensation. And considering how few genuine laughs one generally encounters in movies these days, that's a strong bit of compensation indeed.",1172448000,,3372,4.984014209591474
2525739,3,B000EOTFBW,"True to the style of the novel until it becomes sidetracked, prolific underachiever Michael Winterbottom's riff on Tristram Shandy, A Cock and Bull Story is a half-decent attempt to film an allegedly unfilmable novel, something it does surprisingly well for about half an hour until it gives up and concentrates instead on the travails of making the movie and the growing paranoia of leading man Steve Coogan as he is increasingly upstaged by Rob Brydon. Unfortunately, as so often on the big screen, Coogan is decidedly awkward at first, and the comedy isn't as biting or funny as you'd like, relying a little too awkwardly on injokes. All too obviously a film of two halves, with the backstage story taking over the movie completely for the best part of an hour before returning to the narrative briefly, it's hard not to feel it would have benefited more from dipping in and out of the novel rather than abandoning it for so long. But there's still much to enjoy, not least Rob Brydon playing a love scene in the style of Roger Moore, though it falls far short of Coogan and Winterbottom's previous collaboration, the excellent 24 Hour Party People.

Although at first sight fairly skimpy on the extras, the DVD offers surprisingly good value - not only does the full interview with Tony Wilson (who Coogan played in 24 Hour Party People) appear as promised in the film, but the deleted and extended sequences, though few in number, are longer than expected.",1171152000,,1461,4.7976190476190474
2525740,4,B000EOTFBW,"I just finished watching it, and I'm glad I stuck with it.  The first ten minutes are so deadpan, with ""lead"" Cooney and ""supporting actor"" Rob Brydon talking nose sizes and slowly establishing the subtle rivalries and pettiness that will form a large part of the, uh, for want of a better term, narrative.  I was listening intently, really paying attention, looking for the gem that so many critics loved, and this scene was killing me.  I was afraid the entire film would be this, a ""Waiting for Godot"" in the make-up chair for a period piece.

And then it really took off.  Cooney appears crisply as Shandy in a wonderfully shot scene, talks directly to the camera, and then proceeds to tell an almost&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento/dp/B00003CXZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento</a>-structured tale of his life and its early circumstance.  The movie pseudo-fiction flits in and out as filmed scenes with some canny F/X become scenes in filming, and the story subtly moves to one of a mockumentary on the filming of the feature we're in the process of watching, and which is in the process of benig filmed.  It seems it would be highly confusing, but surprisingly it's not.  Twenty minutes into it, and I was hooked.

Yes, I saw the Merchant-Ivory connection, too.

I can't tell you whether the attention to period detail was accurate or not, but that aspect of the film gave ample opportunity for comedy.

The story slowly grows more complex as what turns out to more or less be a single day of shooting draws on and on, as the demands on star Cooney just keep coming, and his own self-generated problems and issues cause characters and situations to intertwine.  Things are getting darker and more tense, and the personal problems and issues just keep piling up as the evening wears on.  Then there's Coogan's late-night walk through the encamped army before the (to be filmed) monumental battle (who couldn't see the parallel to ""Henry V?""), and things start to become clear.

The new day dawns, it's back to work, things seem to have been sorted out, or at least put on a path toward hopeful positive resolution, and the film moves very quickly and funnily to its end.

The humor is so dry some may well choke on the dust.

If you're looking for some highly nuanced and intellectual comedy that you'll actually have to pay attention to the film to get, this is the one.  Stick with it, and you'll find it's achingly and correspondingly hilariously deadpan.

So original is it, that there's only a loose association.  The latter film had the film's story; then the actors' story behind the scenes.  The composite is more of film about making film and all the fastidious details that comes with the vanity of the creators.  The opening scene has the two main actors (Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon) getting made up in the dressing room.  Rob is fussing profusely about the color of his teeth, and Steve is only too eager to go along with the debate about the exact shade of white or yellow his counterpart will bring to the camera.  Taking a script based on the title character's autobiography, all the powers that be quibble constantly about the details.  At one point, a key director is sharing her vision of a battle scene that esoterically symbolizes futility in life through the combatants.  Some of the funniest moments come when they plan and execute the scenes of Tristam Shandy's conception and birth.

Although original and often funny, 'Tristam Shandy' can sometimes be as tedious and irritating as the vain players who are understandably being mocked on (behind) stage.  When it works, the film gets a bullseye.",1168819200,,1290,4.796380090497737
2525742,1,B000EOTFBW,"Pathetic.  Read the book instead.  As Steve Coogan says in the film, Sterne's novel was a post-modern novel written before there was any modernism to be post about.  Well, okay, but that doesn't provide license to put anything at all on the screen and call it a movie, as has been done here.  I'd have been happier with this film if it had approached T.S.in the spirit of Menippean satire rather than in the spirit of postmodern sloppiness.  Also, I don't necessarily see Tristram Shandy as conventionally unfilmable.  If Lord of the Rings could be filmed, why not T.S.?  Maybe the better approach would have been to film only Volume 1 of T.S., keeping in Parson Yorick, his horses, the midwife, the learned jokes and all the animal spirits rather than to have shortchanged the entire novel so shamelessly.  Then there'd have been opportunity for eight sequels - an entire ""franchise"" of T.S. movies, just like James Bond!",1165104000,4,922,4.791139240506329
2525743,5,B000EOTFBW,"I would hardly have thought it possible, but this film conveys the main themes and events of Sterne's book, although in abbreviated fashion, and with the addition of a faux behind-the-scenes drama or two.  There is full exposure to people and their little obsessions (their hobby horses).  This is a tale of misfortune.  The misfortune attendant on young Tristram's conception, the misfortune of his manhood being somewhat truncated by a falling sash-window, the misfortune that befell Uncle Toby in battle and defeats him with the widow, and the misfortune of Tristram's father, who sees all of his plans for his son come to nothing.  But it is all viewed with Sterne's very own shrewd and knowing humor.

I can fault nothing except, perhaps, the Gillian Anderson actress-from-America subplot, which I would have omitted.  I think most people will have a preference for either the Tristram Shandy story or the ""behind-the-scenes"" story of the filming.  I preferred the former, and this movie ended way to soon for me.

It has a bit of a amateur film feel about it, that draws one into the middle of the making of the film. The film opens with a vignette about the vanity of actors--are my teeth too yellow? do I look good with a big nose? should I get a chin tuck? am I too short? Characters move in and out, and it's not always clear who is who--the agent, the nosy journalist, the moneymen (and women), the history expert, the girlfriend, the pretty assistant, the babies. Some scenes are truly hysterical--all you need to know is that almost all of the Sterne novel happens before the narrator is born, and the filming of the birth is hilarious. This film is not for linear plot types, or those who are bothered by heavy British accents or mumbled dialog.

If not then you'll find little in this film.

Essentially this is a Brit take on the same ideas visited by Truffaut in ""Day for Night."" The core movie is different, but it's the same story. And while from a certain perspective you might say it's in the spirit of TS, in point of fact, TS could have been any book about which they were making an underfunded film. Quel surprise! The best of the movie, for me was the brief dialogue Anderson engages in with Rob Brody, and the blackened screen, i.e. my 2 stars.

You nest it in a film about making a film, then bring in elements from the offscreen life of its star, Steve Coogan, until you've created this Russian doll effect, each story distinct but similar in shape. It's a great idea, but the film works a little too hard at being clever, and some powerful questions about celebrity, autobiography, and the nature of stories take a back seat to making the next witty narrative jump. Coogan and his co-star Rob Brydon are enjoyable to watch, and there's a winning low-key quality to the production that makes you feel like you're on the set watching everyone make it up as they go along.

2525749,4,B000EOTFBW,"Though I think this movie depends too much on the original novel for its form, I found it quite funny at its quitest moments--the opening and closing conversations between Steve Coogan and his co-star about teeth and bald spots, for example.  This movie also has some moments that are very English, where the conversation is punctuated with a lot of um's and ah's and then finally a lot of politeness (if you are a fan of Eddie Izzard, think of the way he described English movies that you can't eat popcorn to).  There is one sequence with a plastic womb that is quite ingenious and funny, but this movie is very clearly one that resists Hollywood conventions and play off those conventions (and sometimes makes overt fun of them) in creating its own film).

In short, this is a good work of meta-cinema: a movie about the making of a movie, where actors are themselves as characters.  If you are interested in this because of Gillian Anderson (X Files), please understand that this has Gillian Anderson playing Gillian Anderson, star of X Files, who accepts a role in a small-budget film about Tristram Shandy.  If you can work with that kind of movie-within-movie level, then you might be amused by this.

While it is not quite necessary to read the original novel to make sense of the movie--there are plenty of references and explanations to make sense of how the movie uses the book--as I mentioned earlier, the movie does very much work off the style of the book, so there are levels of humor and certain ideas that might be more appreciated if you were familiar with the novel.

But when it comes to appreciating the basic humor of the movie, I don't think reading Sterne first is necessary.  Steve Coogan's humor is more of the level of Best in Show or A Mighty Wind, not delivering humor through direct jokes but through the quirkiness of the characters involved.",1155772800,3,1873,4.654545454545454
2525750,3,B000EOTFBW,"Several viewer caveats are in order here.  First off, don't let the title of the movie either intimidate or mislead you.  Knowledge of 18th Century English literature is by no means a prerequisite for approaching this production.  Matter of fact, the fewer preconceptions you have, the better off you probably are.  Which is to say, if you're expecting to see an earnest, straightforward adaptation of Lawrence Stern's novel, you will be sadly disappointed.  That's because ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" has less to do with the actual drama than it does with the filming of this allegedly ""unfilmable"" work, and all the vain goings-on among the cast and crew on and off the set.  Therein lies the crux of this elaborate, Python-esque joke.  Those of you with a grasp of the absurd, especially if you have a fondness for British humour, will probably not find the film's running time of 94 minutes too frightfully long.  Those who don't may wish to bail out of this bad boy after the first half-hour, or sooner.

Second, if your sole purpose in checking out this movie is to see Gillian Anderson, be advised that there isn't nearly enough of her to make the experience worth your while.  As always, she's delightful to watch, playing both herself and the character of Widow Wadman (leaping effortlessly from an American dialect to British, then back again).  But she doesn't appear until more than three quarters into the film, and the delight is ever so teasingly brief.  Like the movie itself (or, I should say, the movie within the movie), she leaves you wanting more.  The actress is definitely under employed here--I dare say, she's wasted in this enterprise.  Then again, the very fact that she IS wasted is, in itself, part of overall joke.  So in a sense, she really is NOT wasted.  (Huh???)  The only way make to sense of this riddle is to see her within the context of the entire movie.  If, at the end, you just don't ""get it,"" relax; you're probably not the only one.

My advice to those diehard Gillian fans out there, who might resent wading through an hour's worth of shallow, convoluted ""batter"" to savour about 7 minutes worth of tasty content: I suggest you skip the PLAY button on your DVD menu, and click on the SCENE SELECTION button instead; find the two or three scenes she's in, watch them and discard the rest.  Then you can pop in a tape of your favorite X-Files episode and try to bide your time until ""Last King of Scotland"" is released in theatres this Fall.

The non-Gillian cast is uniformly top-notch.  Certain viewers may feel that the principals (Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon, et al) were more entertaining portraying the characters in Stern's novel than they were playing/being themselves.  Again, that's a question of personal disposition.

For the record, I did not dislike the film.  I actually found it quite a hoot (pardon the Americanism). I'm not at all sorry that I stuck it out to the end.  Neither is my wife, which is surprising since she usually hasn't much patience for cinematic oddities such as this.  She would have been much happier, however, without the sudden eruption of obscenities that took place in a couple of scenes, somewhat late into the film--which, I don't mind telling you, added not a thing to what was, until then, a virtually (98 percent) F-free script.

""Tristram"" isn't everyone's cup of java---not a movie I would recommend to someone whose tastes I didn't already know.  The think the subtitle, ""Cock and Bull Story,"" pretty much tells you what you need to know.  The movie may not go anyplace, but it does have fun getting there, in a rambling, off-the-wall sort of way.",1155513600,,3649,4.736925515055468
2525751,4,B000EOTFBW,"Steve Coogan is irresistibly entertaining in this offbeat film - a movie within a movie that crosses portions of a fine novel with the machinations if turning that novel into a film.  Yes, this has been done successfully before, but rarely with the loonieness and candor that suffuses this entertaining insider look at making a novel visual.

Director Michael Winterbottom and the entire cast and crew making the film Tristram Shandy follow a script (by Frank Cottrell Boyce), but in a manner that feels like extemporaneous commentary on the 18th century Lawrence Sterne novel.  Steve Coogan is introduced as the makeup artists are altering his nose and facial features to reflect those of Tristram while his co-star Rob Brydon is being transformed into the character of Captain Shandy.  From conversations about technical aspects of shooting a film the camera splices into actual scenes from the 'movie', most of which deal with the birthing of Tristram.  The purpose of the film reflects an aspect of the book about a man who is attempting to delve into the history and actions that result in the creation of the title character.

The cast is strong: in addition to Coogan and Brydon, the minor roles are filled by Jeremy Northam, Kelly Macdonald, Shirley Henderson, Benedict Wong, Keeley Hawes, Gillian Anderson, Naomie Harris in addition to the costumers and makeup artists as well drawn characters in and of themselves!  For many the film may feel disjointed and meandering, but give into the concept of the delightful mix of shortcuts enhanced by commentary from the actors and crew and this Cock and Bull story is a terrific costume period piece romp.  It is just meant to be fun and full of chuckles.  Grady Harp, August 06",1154390400,3,1731,4.941379310344828
2525752,3,B000EOTFBW,The parts that were actually the novel were excellent. If they'd just stuck to the book it could have been a great film. Some of the interspersed asides about the making of it were enjoyable. But the bulk of the film is a lot of boring true to life (scripted? improvised? who cares?) backstage stuff.,1153872000,,300,4.472727272727273
2525753,2,B000EOTFBW,"Winterbottom's adaptation of Sterne's famously-unfilmable novel starts out promisingly, with period costumes and a serious tone, interrupted by the main character talking to the camera.  However this is nearly the last attempt at even referencing the book, as the next 90 minutes are consumed with actors portraying the minutae of making a movie.  Literary allusions are discarded in favor of a self-conscious litany of cinematic illusions.

When Karel Reisz attempted a similar adaptation of John Fowles' book ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" he cleverly turned the ""book about writing a book"" into a ""movie about making a movie.""  The essential heart of the novel was maintained, even though almost all of the details changed.

When Spike Jonze undertook the unfilmable ""The Orchid Thief"" (resulting in ""Adaptation"" - starring, again, Meryl Streep) the book served as a backdrop to a new storyline, which diverged farther and farther from the source material as the movie progressed, or regressed as the case may be.

So Winterbottom had precedents he could have followed.  Instead he chose a Terry Gilliamesque slapstick (right down to the DVD menues) which essentially dispenses with the book in the first 5 minutes.  What we get is a long and drawn-out sketch which is neither funny nor literary nor -- most importantly -- faithful to the book.

On DVD, this bears the appearance of a mildly-amusing Bonus Feature.  Alas, it was the main course, and I was left feeling unfulfilled. What's missing is more than Meryl Streep!",1153526400,4,1527,5.170731707317073
2525754,4,B000EOTFBW,"It has apparently been a universal conclusion of long standing that it would be impossible to turn Laurence Sterne's novel ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"" into a film.  So director Michael Winterbottom does not really try to do so in this 2005 film, ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story.""  This is utterly appropriate, but at the same time totally confounding and while I want to say it is not as satisfying as it could be I have no idea as to what would constitute complete satisfaction under the circumstances.  So just accept that going in and make your peace with it as best you can.

Your ability to enjoy the film may well be predicated on your knowledge of the novel itself, which may be limited.  On the one hand the latest Amazon rankings for paper back copies of ""Tristram Shandy"" are #4,644 and #184,723 respectively (and dropping), but on the other hand if you are checking out the DVD then you have at least heard of it (or you are looking at the film's subtitle and making valid assumptions regarding the film's ribalry).  Sterne's experimental novel (ivory tower talk for nobody knew what the hell the guy was doing; it is also called one of the first psychological novels) was published in nine volumes between 1759 and 1767.  Narrated by Shandy, it begins at the moment of his conception and continues foward with an almost endless interruptions and digression, including stories within stories and basically every other narrative device at Sterne's disposal (including unfinished stories and pages of asterisks) with scant regard for chronological order.  Everything is fair game.  There is a wonderful joke in the film at the novel's expense when the cast is heartened to learn that ""Tristram Shandy"" is number seven on the list of the greatest novels of all time put out by the ""Observer,"" only to have their hopes dashed when they learn the list is chronological (Please continue to read this review and do not try and figure out what the first six would be and I will tell you at the end).

The most obvious cinematic reference point for ""Tristram Shandy: A Cook and Bull Story"" would be Al Pacino's ""Looking for Richard,"" which also spends considerable time looking at the production from the outside.  The best way to describe this movie is that it takes place on the set of the movie ""Tristram Shandy,"" where the actor plays not only Tristram and his father, Walter, but also the actor Steve Coogan.  This is true of the rest of the cast, which includes Rob Brydon, Gillian Anderson, Keeley Hawes, Shirley Henderson, and Jeremy Northam.  I did not actually time things, but it could well be that the actors spend more time discussing their characters and scenes than they do in playing them.

If there is a constant in this film it would be that Coogan and Brydon keep up a running battle of unveiled but relatively civil insults from start to finish, including a final round during the closing credits.  Otherwise there is no more narrative structure to the film than to the novel, which, after all, would be the whole point.  Any additional attempt at description of this film is mere vanity, and all you really need to know in the end is that it does not matter than you have never read ""Tristram Shandy,"" because only one of the actors in the film actually has, and look what good it does her.

Now, as promised, here are the results.  Ahead of ""Tristram Shandy"" on ""The 100 greatest novels of all time: The list"" put out by ""The Observer,"" in ascending order, are: (6) ""Clarissa"" by Samuel Richardson, (5) ""Tom Jones"" by Henry Fielding,(4) ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift, (3) ""Robinson Crusoe"" by Daniel Defoe, (2) ""Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan,"" and, of course, (1) ""Don Quixote"" by Miguel De Cervantes.  Is it not interesting than ""Tom Jones"" was an Oscar winning film, but ""Gulliver's Travels"" ended up as a semi-classic animated film and ""Don Quixote"" got changed into a Broadway musical that privileged Part 2 over Part 1?",1152835200,3,3996,4.7485549132947975
2525755,3,B000EOTFBW,"""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" is a clever but ultimately uninspiring 21st century answer to Laurence Sterne's 18th century 9-volume comic novel ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"". The book is a fictional autobiography narrated by Tristram Shandy, who is always conscious of the fact that he telling his life story in a physical book that someone is reading, as opposed to addressing a neat narrative to no one in particular. The self-reflexive nature of the novel made it an early forerunner of post-modernism. Director Michael Winterbottom honors the novel's theme -life is chaotic- and its self-reflexive style by making a movie about making a movie of ""Tristram Shandy"". ""Tristram Shandy"", the Winterbottom film, shifts between the movie of the novel and the making of said movie. ""Tristram Shandy"", the period film within the film, moves back and forth in time as Shandy narrates his life in whatever order strikes him.

The actors who have parts in the ""Tristram Shandy"" period film also play versions of themselves -some closer to the truth than others- in the modern making of the film. Steve Coogan plays Tristram Shandy, his father Walter Shandy, and an especially narcissistic version of himself, the actor. Rob Bydon plays Tristram's Uncle Toby Shandy, who is preoccupied with the Battle of Namur in which he received an embarrassing injury, as well as a version of himself, who is preoccupied with a battle of egos with co-star Steve Coogan. The two actors miss no opportunity to insult one another and bicker over lines, wardrobe, and screen time. Meanwhile, the put-upon director (Jeremy Northam) must wrangle the budget to complete the battle scenes. And Steve is carrying on a flirtation with a lovely production runner named Jennie (Naomie Harris) while girlfriend Jenny (Kelly Macdonald) and infant son try to get some attention in between Steve's bouts of egoism. Shirley Henderson, Stephen Fry, Gillian Anderson, and Tony Wilson (whom Coogan played memorably in ""24 Hour Party People"") also make appearances.

It sounds like a great idea. The perfect -and perhaps only- way to adapt the unfilmable ""Tristram Shandy"" for the screen. The trouble is that it's tedious. ""Tristram Shandy"" is only sporadically funny, and the lags between laughs are insufferable. The concept is brilliant. But this movie, like the book that inspired it, is comedy. There is not much room for objectivity or analysis in comedy. You either laugh or you don't. And I didn't. A few times I thought the film might have been better had it sent up the film-making process more and strayed less into off-set personal issues. Or been a little more bawdy and daring in its modern scenarios. Less wobbly handheld camera work would have been an improvement. ""Tristram Shandy"" has its moments. But you're either going to find the modern characters funny or you're going to find them deadly dull.

The DVD (HBO Home Video): ""Complete Tony Wilson Interview with Steve Coogan"" (12 min) is the full version of the fictional interview with a member of the press, played by Wilson, that we saw in the movie. Coogan's deadpan insults and self-promotion are quite funny. ""Behind the Scenes Footage"" offers 2 selections: Some footage from the Night Shoot with the Sealed Knot Re-enactors (2 min). Skip that. And a Tour of Shandy Hall, Laurence Sterne's Home (16 min). Stephen Fry and curator Patrick Wildgust (whom Fry plays in the movie) discuss Sterne and the book's themes. Recommended for those interested in film's origins. There are also 3 deleted scenes, 4 extended scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary by actors Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Coogan and Brydon give a non-stop, sometimes satirical commentary. There is a little bit of everything in here: some stuff about filming, other actors, themselves, a lot that's difficult to put a finger on. These two sure are talkers. The commentary is worthwhile for their fans. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.",1152748800,14,4020,5.060331825037707
2525756,3,B000EOTFBW,"Tristram Shandy, the film, follows in a long line of films about films: Fellini's 8 1/2, Godard's Contempt, Truffaut's Day for Night, Wender's State of Things. Each of these films explores the possibility of artistic expression in a crass era when all value is compromised/determined by market pressure. Tristram Shandy, the film, is making comments about the impossibility of making an art film in a crassly commercial era when hype is valued over substance and star power and ego trump talent and integrity. Winterbottom cleverly mingles postmodern literary and cinematic techniques and concocts a postmodern blend of literature and film. The sheer ambition of the premise seems to forebode either a clever postmodern hybrid  or a disaster and the film is ultimately both. Winterbottom is not only saying that the very nature of the film industry in an era of crass commercialization (and Sterne would have envisoned his own 18th cent. world to be as crassly commercial as our own) is not commensurate to art but that the market pressures of the film industry/modern world tend to make people view not only their creations but themselves as industry products or commodities.

If you are looking for something as funny as Tom Jones or Spinal Tap you might be frustrated because this film actually is a much more cerebral kind of comedy. This is one of those films where you have to think the whole time you are watching. Thats not to say that this film does not have some slapstick and vaudevillian moments because it does but that humor is contained within a much more complex film that is after much more sophisticated affects. The most immediate target is the film industry (not just Hollywood but apparently every kind of cinema, mainstream and independent) and the infantile megalomonaics who produce, direct and star in film projects which strictly speaking are all, in one way or another, either designed to make money or are just vanity projects designed to make all the megalomaniacs involved feel good about themselves. Pretty much everyone gets skewered in this film; even the young assistant/ Fassbinder fan just sounds pretensious. The question that the film seems to be asking is whether there is any such thing as art or identity that is not simply a veiled form of self-interest/self-absorption/self-promotion. Thus the film is much more cynical than the novel Tristram Shandy even though both are interested in parodying the human comedy.

Whether you think the film is an example of postmodernism or a parody of postmodernism it really doesn't matter because they both amount to the same thing (Tristram Shandy IS parody; postmodernism IS parody; you can't really parody a parody) . Ultimately very little of the book is used and the project of filming a novel as complex as Tristram Shandy is abandoned (not only because the novel is ""unfilmable"", but also because the cast and crew lose interest in the novel, or, never had that much interest in it in the first place-- or that is the running joke of the film anyway); what is not abandoned is the novel's self-consciousness,its fondness for digression, and its deconstruction of every certainty on which to build an artistic vision. The film version of Tristram Shandy makes a lot of the same points that Fellini, and Godard, and Truffaut and Wenders make but what is new is that it makes these points in a comedic way so even while the film is lampooning commercial art and identity its easy to just surrender to the entire enterprise's mirthful spirit and laugh away the fact that the film is not just parodying the film industry but life in the postmodern world (which can only be a kind of parody of life).

 In the postmodern history virtually vanishes as the past and the present can no longer be kept separate and distinct (the historian may look into the past but all he/she sees is a version of him/herself); art and reality cannot be kept apart and so whether art mimics life or life mimics art can never really be determined (nor can it really be determined to what extent market pressures affect our perceptions and defintions of art and life, nature and reality), and no one voice or director's vision can maintain any kind of order over the chaos of the myriad voices and visions of its diverse cast and crew.  Also in the postmodern the sanctity of high art is compromised by its affiliation and reliance on low art. The two categories, high and low, have never been as far apart as the highbrows would have you think. Samuel Beckett was a huge Laurel and Hardy fan, Woody Allen a Marx Brothers fan; both of these postmodernists despair over the lack of meaning in the modern world though neither ever altogether cease believing in art as a way of coping with and/or managing the anxiety and distress of trying to function in such a world. Postmodernism might not pretend to make sense of anything or even offer the hope that things can make sense but it does, on occasion, invite us to laugh at the absurdity of our predicament and thus relieve some of the tension/ambivalence/irresolvedness we feel about our lives.

There are certainly plenty of ideas at work in Tristram Shandy, but, as with all films, the real appeal lies with its ""stars"" and how well they bring these ideas to life (or how well they market the ideas and themselves). If you don't know who Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are its because they are British television personalities. The two work well together and when they are improvising things do get hysterical. We get a taste of this when these two are sharing scenes at the films opening and closing. One problem is that there are not very many scenes inbetween when these two are together and so many people feel that the high points of the film are the beginning and the end. This film is my first introduction to Coogan and Brydon and they are very funny in a self-deprecating and deadpan way. Coogan is a very clever guy who likes to play at being profoundly superficial. There is some comedic cleverness when watching Coogan do a mock interview as himself. He enjoys crafting personas and mocking them. But as an actor known primarily for one particular role (Andy Partridge) Steve Coogan always seems to be insecure about whether he is ever given credit for actually being Steve Coogan or whether everyone just thinks that Steve Coogan is just another fiction--a variation or derivation of his character Andy Partridge. He insists that somewhere within all of the role playing is the real Steve Coogan who is more than just an actor, but this seems to be something that he is highly defensive and insecure about and this makes for some very funny existential-postmodern comedy. Identity crisis and self-reflexivity seem to be this actor's forte and so he is the perfect actor for this postmodern film within a film. Possibly this film works better for British audiences who are more familiar with Steve Coogan's television personality but I think you can pick up on the jokes even without knowledge of who Andy Partridge is.  Coogan and Brydon are parodying the art making process and they are parodying themselves as they do so. There is an infinite regression of parody with no stable or fixed center because we never know amid all of Coogan's identity shifts  whether any of them represent a stable or fixed identity. And this is where the film most resembles the novel for in the novel it is debated whether there is anything like a ""self"" or ""identity"" at all, or if life is just a series of socially (and market) coerced performances.

Whether you think the film succeeds or not depends on what you are asking the film to be. I think some people see the film as a simple satire on some foolish actors; others sense that the film is trying to be more ambitious than that. I think the film can be enjoyed as simply a screwball comedy with a postmodern sensibility but it can also be viewed as a very clever look at life/art in the postmodern era.",1152662400,4,7966,4.770123277737491

There are moments and characters that reminded me of 8 1/2 but I could have easily overlooked them if the music Fellini picked for his classic wasn't constantly used in this film. This is not an homage to 8 1/2 so it makes no sense at all to remind the audience that they could be watching a brilliant piece of art instead. The three stars are for the actors and script.

Answer: ""Because it's funny.""

This is one of the conversations that takes place in this movie. There's just one problem - it isn't funny.

Having just read the novel, I was curious to see the film adaptation of this ""unfilmable"" work. None of the characters are lovable in the way Sterne wrote them. Moreover, the warmth is missing between Trim and Uncle Toby, and Uncle Toby and his brother, Walter. None of the actors generate empathy or affection.

The filmmakers decided to intertwine scenes of ""the making of"" this movie. We're privy to conversations talking about the movie, the book, its characters, and what to film and what to exclude.
