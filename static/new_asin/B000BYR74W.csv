8094457,4,B000BYR74W,"DVD shows graphic overlays of the muscles on top of the patient's skin so you can really see what you're palpating.  The other major plus is that Clint Chandler uses 5 or 6 different models for each muscle/muscle group so you can find a particular muscle on various body types.  Another plus is he shows you a resistive movement to engage the muscle - this is good for working on flabby or hypotonic clients/patients.  One downside - particularly palpating the rotator cuff and teres major - is that the DVD cautions about working in/around the axillary endangerment site but does not explain how to proceed with caution.  My palpation skills are so-so.  I would have been EXTREMELY grateful to learn how to tell whether I'm palpating nerve plexus or whatever.  It's easy to follow and there is some humor mixed in to keep your attention.  There are 3 disks, so if you can split the cost and share/rotate with fellow students I'd recommend that because the cost is prohibitive.",1208736000,,977,4.745562130177515
8094458,5,B000BYR74W,"I have been in the massage business for 13 years and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Clint's video series. The way he superimposes the muscles in freeze frame over the client he is working on was a great learning tool. My clients have benefited greatly from the training I've received from studying Clints' DVD series. Thank you!

8094459,5,B000BYR74W,"This is one awesome DVD.

 An instructor is shown working with a client/model on a massage table and for each muscle, he points to the exact muscle attachments on the bones.  He then palpates each muscle individually very slowly.  Then the video is frozen while a superimposed illustration from the Trail Guide (book)is overlayed on top of the actual client. This is fantastic!

He explains how to palpate muscles if they are deep to other muscles.  He tells you what you will feel in the tissue while palpating each muscle.  He tells you while you are feeling the belly of each muscle - what you might run into - such as the muscle going underneath the clavicle.  He has the client move their body to highlight each muscle and its action.  You can actually see the muscle working. He then shows the same sequence on another client and from different angles (superior, inferior, left, right etc) There are two women and at least two male models - one male being a body builder with very developed muscles.

The instructor does not massage the client - he only palpates the muscle.  He basically highlights the muscle verbally and visually - then he gently picks up each section of the muscle with his thumb and finger. He follows the muscle from origin to insertion on the bone.

The Trail Guide To the Body is a great series including the book and flash cards, but this 3 set DVD series is the cat's meow!

For any massage therapy students, this will bring the instructor right into your home - just like having your own personal tutor!

I highly recommend this DVD set.",1135123200,21,1571,4.584229390681004
8094460,5,B000BYR74W,"As a physician who labored through Gross Anatomy, I can greatly appreciate the delightfully simple, and yet comprehensive, multi-modal approach this DVD set takes in instructing us in the marvelous workings of our musculoskeletal system. I am lucky enough to be a patient of Clint Chandler's.  His broad and holistic understanding of these musculoskeletal issues is the most thorough I have ever experienced, superior to that of any Orthopedic surgeon I have known.  Fortunately for his patients, this understanding is conveyed during his sessions in clear, concise and logical explanations that accompany his body work.  Now, any student of anatomy, massage therapy, physical therapy (or any other body work discipline) can enjoy the same easy teaching style with these DVDs.  If a picture is worth a thousand words, these DVDs certainly are worth a few million!",1133740800,14,863,5.323529411764706
8094461,5,B000BYR74W,"The combination of great visuals (including overlays of muscles and landmarks), clear verbal instruction, and the use of a variety of body types makes for a thorough and even entertaining presentation of the highest quality.  The information is not redundant.  It would be an excellent way to brush up on forgotten skills, learn new information, or prepare for an exam. This DVD is a must-have for any physical therapist, massage therapist, or other health care professional, and would be a great addition to classroom learning.",1133481600,5,528,5.2
8094462,5,B000BYR74W,"I am a graduate of the Boulder College of Massage therapy and a Nationaly Certified Massage Therapist. I have been practicing the healing art of massage for over ten years. The Trail Guide to the Body DVD is,hands down,the best muscle paplpation training material I have ever experienced. The information flows and the presentaion is direct,specific,cohesive and comprehensive. The Trail Guide to the Body should be a requirement for anybody in the Health and Wellness Industry. This DVD is beyond a an anatomical review. It is a reference resource.",1132358400,5,549,5.179775280898877
8094463,5,B000BYR74W,"I bought this CD as a refresher to the coursework I had in massage school five years ago.  It is awesome!  In fact, the video goes into much more detail than my former instructors did.  The video medium makes it easy to freeze, rewind, slow motion, etc.  Also, the DVD is well-made and easy to watch (good lighting and audio).",1132012800,8,326,4.383333333333334
