2558575,3,B000FAOCF4,"This is an interesting and entertaining DVD, but leaves the viewer with a unsatisfied feeling at the end.

The other reviewers have written plenty to give you a good idea of what this film is like.  I wanted to comment on a few things that particularly struck me about the film:

1) The film is only partially about the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  There is little history or examination of the PotEoZ.  They are used, instead, as a gum and bailing wire patchwork backdrop to hold this rambling, disjointed film together -- barely.  What does Mel Gibson's PASSION OF THE CHRIST have to do with the PotEoZ?  Nothing, of course.  So why does it figure so prominently in the film?  Because there was some whining about the film being anti-semitic when it was released, which happened while Levin was doing his film.  All of the whining turned out to be 100% unfounded, of course, but why argue with history when hysterics are so much more photogenic?

2) Nothing gets anywhere.  Just when you are seeing people interviewed to the point where something might be established, resolved, or proven...we cut to something else.  Ugh!

3) Idiots.  The film is full of idiots.  The most disturbing idiots are the Palestinian-American idiots, Muslim all, who are really little more than foul-mouthed, New Jersey, street corner hanging homeboys.  Yes, what a fine image of modern Arab manhood they cut too.  Anyone who can watch those scenes and see them as not being potential terrorists is a better man than me.

The White Supremacist and White Separatist were, by contrast,  downright agreeable hateful folk.  Yes, they might not want you to live in their neighborhood or date their daughter, but by gosh, they say it with a smile while wearing a bright red tie.

Levin, who is less a voice of reason than a useless questioner here, allows everyone to make fools of themselves, and him.  The single most disgusting person in the film turns out to not be an angry Arab-American, nor a White supremacist, but a foul-mouthed, Dick Cheney hating, Jewish liberal who so hates the Vice President that he claims he would rather go to hell than be in heaven with him.  He thoroughly enjoyed using the f-bomb as a modifier.  With his limited brain capacity and outrageous stupidity, he will probably get his wish.

4) It is ironic that the Protestant Christians in the film, who are not said to be, but are certainly slanted to be heavies, come across as some of the most decent and sane voices in the entire film.  They are sane, happy, well-spoken, never curse, don't hate anybody, don't read the Protocols of Zion, and would still choose heaven over hell even if it meant sharing quarters with Dick Cheney.

5) I think it would have been better if Levin gave up the pretense of researching the Protocols, and instead simple allowed the collected anti-semites to expose their idiocy for a full two or three hours.  Then again, the fact that Levin PROVES that Jews died in the World Trade Center is worthwhile because there are so many morons out in the world who think it didn't happen.",1156636800,6,3074,4.704119850187266
2558576,3,B000FAOCF4,"'The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion' is one of the most famous underground books available all across the world.  Although the book has been proven to be a forgery many times, there are still a considerable amount of people who believe what is written in the book.  In brief, the book tells of a secret meeting between a group of Jews who plan to take over the world by controlling the banks and media.  I have not read the book, but this is what I've heard what the book is about.  This documentary is about a Jewish filmmaker who goes all around New York City and the United States and asks all kind of people about their thoughts about Jews and the book.

This film had the potential to be a really great documentary, but Marc Levin does not go deep enough.  Although certain moments of the film are really funny, Levin is too brief or sloppy.  He is open-minded and fair though.  He interviews all kinds of people; white supremacists, African-Americans, American Palestinians, Jews, and many others.  He does shatter some myths about the Jews and the book, but other parts are just brushed over without any kind of clarity.  I must commend him, though, for tackling some controversial issues and talking to people who are not afraid to express their extremist views.",1155686400,,1279,4.619469026548672
2558577,2,B000FAOCF4,"Directed by Jewish film maker Marc LEVIN, PROTOCOLS OF ZION depicts so called ""anti-Semitism"" in the wake of 9/11. Intrigued by fringe conspiracy theories claiming that no Jews died when the planes hit the World Trade Center due to their knowledge in advance or that the attack was orchestrated by the Mossad, LEVIN chronicles the history of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and its impact. Written in Czarist Russia at the turn of the century, soon translated into dozens of languages and distributed around the globe, the PROTOCOLS are one of the most infamous books of all times and purports to detail the masterplan of the Jews to take over the world. In 1920, famous industrialist Henry FORD started to distribute it in the USA (each sold car came with a free copy of the PROTOCOLS). The PROTOCOLS remain popular to this very day. They recently inspired TV mini-series like HORSEMAN WITHOUT A HORSE in Egypt or DIASPORA in Syria. A reprint by a New Jersey based Arab American newspaper caused quite a scandal in 2002. They are influential for many Arab political movements like Hamas.

The documentary chronicles the history of the protocols, along with lots of interviews with ""anti-Semites"", ranging from Blacks to Arab Americans to white nationalists (like National Alliance chairman Shaun WALKER or separatist Frank WELTNER, who runs the Jewwatch web site).

It goes without saying that the film's audience can not expect a balanced view on this subject. Anything which could be disadvantagous to the Jews or would prove that some claims of the interviewees have a factual basis is either left out or very quickly passed over. For instance, early on in the film it is (correctly) stated in a clip from a news broadcast that neo conservatives are disproportionately Jewish and that an unwavering support for the state of Israel might not be in the interest of the United States and her people. However, this is quickly passed over by LEVIN. In another scene we are witness to the Israel Day Parade in downtown Manhattan. Jewish attendees wave posters with anti-Arab hate slogans like ""Nazi Arabs out of Israel"" or ""Kahane was right"" (in case you did not know, Meir KAHANE was a Jewish terrorist.)A Jew is interviewed and demands that the Israeli government should forcefully expell all Arabs, however this prime example of hate speech is (unsurprisingly) not challenged or commented upon by LEVIN.

Generally speaking, LEVIN does all he can to portray critics of Israel and Jewish supremacy in the least favorable manner. Luckily, he is more often than not not very successful with his approach. A lot of the interviewees come across as articulate, intelligent and likeable. Few of them were hostile to the film maker. Granted, there are exceptions like the black guy who claimed from the bottom of his heart completely straight faced that the former mayor of New York City is Jewish (""Jewliani"") - much to the amusement of bystanders. However, all in all, in my view few of the interviewees fit the usual cliche as being uneducated and narrow minded hate mongers. I was particularly impressed with Shaun WALKER, chairman of the white nationalist National Alliance. He came across as a likeable, matter-of-factly, articulate and intelligent man with politically incorrect opinions (even the film maker was surprised by this and he comments on it in an interview in the extra feature section of the DVD.) Unfortunately in today's overtly politically correct world people are afraid to say or write anything which may be viewed as ""anti-Semitic"", resulting in what is called ""white guilt"". A prime example of this is given in the documentary when Mr. LEVIN talks with a Christian church group.

I also disliked the director's approach. Mr. LEVIN tends to nitpick, but fails to address obvious questions. For instance, when Mr. WALKER claims that a certain well-known media tycoon is a Jew, LEVIN challenges this opinion. But does it really matter whether the tycoon in question is really Jewish? Should not the real issue be how it comes that Jews have vastly disproportionate influence and power in the news and entertainment industry?

On the technical side there is nothing to complain about. The DVD is a widescreen prestation with good picture quality. There are lots of extra features. There is an interesting question and answer session with director LEVIN from last year's Boston Jewish Film Festival. There are two deleted interviews, one with Christian scholar James CAROLL who elaborates on a ""new"" (i.e. non anti-Semitic) reading of the Passion, which should skip the older literal reading that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. The other interview is with Jewish comic strip artist Will EISNER, who comments on his comic, where he debunks the Protocols. (I had a good chuckle, when he claimed that the Protocols helped the Arabs gaining ""victimhood"" status - of course, you know, who the real experts in claiming the cherished ""victim status"" are, don't you?) There is also a historical timeline and the film's trailer, which sell the film well. There are also three additional trailers: FATELESS (a holocaust melodrama), THE BOYS OF BARAKA (a documentary about black teenagers from a ghetto on vacation in Africa) and BORN INTO BROTHELS (a documentary about children in a Calcutta slum), none of which impressed me at all.

I am convinced that PROTOCOLS OF ZION will find favour with the intended core audience of the Jewish community and bleeding heart liberals, but urge all others to approach with caution.",1154822400,11,5556,5.020607375271149
2558578,4,B000FAOCF4,"In college, I became interested in exploring the nature of evil.  I studied the Nazi propaganda in the belief that what was generally available, such as accusing Jews of being overly fond of money and insufficiently fond of work, could not explain how an entire country became cold blooded murderers.  There must be some inflammatory material so powerful that it was being suppressed.  I eventually decided that there was no secret, suppressed inflammatory material, that the crude anti-Jewish stereotypes and analogies to vermin, and nothing more, had incited the Germans to genocide.  The reason the Germans hated the Jews was that they hated the Jews.  This caused me to adopt Orca's rule: when seeking explanations for human behavior never underestimate the shallow and superficial.

This movie plumbs the depths of men souls and once again we find that the shallow and superficial rules the day.  The Jews were responsible for 9/11 because that is the sort of things that Jews do and we know that terrorism is that kind of thing that Jews because they were responsible for 9/11.  Director Levin proves that he has got the guts to interview some very scary people.  Levin does not burden us with any solutions and I know of none.  So long as people feel the need to hate Jews, no amount of rationality will convince them otherwise.  After watching this, I'm tempted to stockpile ammunition.

There is one jarring image unexamined in this film.  In a few scenes, Levin visits his father's home where a large poster of Che Guevara graces the wall.  I assume a purpose of this movie is to prevent mass murder yet here, without comment, a major symbol of the only political movement whose body count exceeds the Nazis and who was himself a mass murder adorns the wall.  Things are not looking good for the human race.

As I write this (late July 2006), Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah are engaged in yet another Middle Eastern War.  Unfortunately, there is nothing unusual about that.  What is unusual is that the moonbat wing of the American left has resorted to vile anti-Jewish propaganda disguised as pleas for peace.  See, for example, the Daily Kos blog of moonbat Markos Moulitsas Zniga which includes, for example, a parody of John Lennon's Imagine in which what is being imagined is a world without Jews, or at least without Jewish influence.  I suspect that the unstated proposition is that given that there are a billion Muslims and only a few million Jews that if we were to throw the Jews under the bus, well, it would be a lot more peaceful than standing up to the Muslims.  Kos has also launched a vicious attack on liberal Democrat Jew Joe Lieberman.  I feel confident that Kos will soon resume his well deserved status of footnote despite the mainstream media's elevation of him to wunderkind a few weeks ago after his Las Vegas convention, but for the moment, a major American political party, in fact the major American political party that most Jews support, is supplying viciously anti-Jewish propaganda while the silence is deafening from the not quite as crazy Democratic leadership, quite possibly because they fear the Lieberman treatment.  And Kos is by no means the only one.  The left has a strong anti-Jewish element and that anti-Jewish element is getting stronger.  And yet director Levin's father has a poster of Che on the wall.  Did I mention that I am tempted to stockpile ammunition?

This is a very involving and scary film.

P.S.  I am not Jewish, Christian, or Muslim.",1153785600,21,3504,4.822445561139029
2558579,4,B000FAOCF4,"In the wake of September 11th, documentarian Mark Levin (""Gladiator Days: Anatomy of a Prison Murder,"" ""Soldiers in the Army of God""), was stunned to hear people on the streets of New York City claiming that no Jews were killed when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center fell.  He was also told that the attack was not made by Islamic terrorists but was instead part of a Zionist plot that had been set down over a century early in a book called ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.""  According to some this is a record of a secret meeting in which Jewish leaders set down their plan for world domination.  For others it is a hoax, consisting of material plagiarized from earlier sources, perpetrated by the Tsarist police to attack the Bolsheviks.  If you fall into the first camp then all you need to know about this 2005 documentary is that Mark Levin is Jewish.  He does not belong to a synagogue, but his grandfather is honored in one, and since the director is Jewish this film would have to be seen as an attack on those who dare to debunk the ""Protocols.""  If you are in the second camp then what you will find here is a look at the power and pervasiveness of hate.

I belong to the second camp, which means I think it would be interesting to see somebody from the first camp telling Osama bin-Laden that it was the Jews who brought down the WTC and not Al Qaeda's suicide hijackers.  On the topic of the world Jewish conspiracy, my opinion is that it is not going too well.  There is a scene where Levin is in West Palm Beach, wanting somebody to explain the Butterfly-ballot fiasco in light of the Jewish plan to take over the world.  Of course he fails to look at it from the perspective of the rabid conspiracy theorists, who would still see this as evidence that the ""Protocols"" are true because having Bush and Cheney in office who be more beneficial than having Gore and Joe Lieberman.  The Democrats would not have invented Iraq, whereas the Republicans were looking for an excuse.  And so it goes.

The ""Protocols"" are the starting point for Levin taking his camera and having interesting discussions with Arab Americans, white nationalists, black nationalists, Christian evangelicals, Kabbalist rabbis, Holocaust survivors, and who ever else he can find.  The ""Protocols"" keep popping up, but Levin is looking at anti-Semitism in the wake of 9/11.  This includes not only a white supremacy that cannot keep copies of the ""Protocols"" on their shelf in West Virginia, but also the opening of Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion.""  For the most part Levin lets people say what they want to say, but he often tries to challenge some of the statement.  The best indication of how this usually goes is when he is told that New York City is controlled by Jews in the person of Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Levin counters by pointing on that on 9/11 the major was Rudy Giuliani only to be told that ""Jew-liani"" proves the argument as well.  And so it goes.

British journalist and diplomatic Lucien Wolf was the first to document that the protocols were fabricated from two obscure 19th-century sources, Maurice Joly's ""Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu"" (1864) and Herman Goedsche's ""Biarritz"" (1868).  This comes out more in the bonus interview with Will Eisner, who's graphic novel ""The Plot"" tells the history of ""The Protocols of Zion,"" than it does in Levin's documentary, which is more interested than taking the premise and looking at those who believe the hoax to be true.  There is also more of the interview with James Carroll on the Passion story, the ""Protocols of Zion"" trailer, and a timeline, as well as a discussion with Marc Levin at the Boston Jewish Film Festival, November 6, 2005, where he freely admits he has no solution to the problem of combating such hatred.  However, he does argue that this is the question on the table for the current generation.

Beyond the notion that anti-Semiticism is making a comeback in the 21st century, Levin covers the entire range of such beliefs, from those who brandish weapons while promising death to the Jews to small children who have been taught to hate.  But beyond the power and the prevalence of such hate there is also a chilling element of politeness.  I would have thought that people discussing such things in calm voices would have been a good thing, but it does not turn out to be that way.  In the end, ""Protocols of Zion"" leaves viewers as bewildered as it does the filmmaker as to where do we go from here.  You hate to get to the end of such a documentary and feel such a sense of despair, but hope is hardly a rational belief in light of what we see on the nightly news (regardless of who is really behind it).",1152576000,30,4715,4.6009557945041815
2558580,3,B000FAOCF4,"I read the book and watched the dvd by Marc Levin (called Protocols of Zion). I thought both were worth my time. The dvd provides clear evidence of what some in our world believe and shows the passions that are yoked to those convictions. There are people who will immediately discount and reject Levin's presentation, but, taken at face value, it clearly presents a collection of straight forward experiences and, honestly, saddens me. We are a deeply torn humanity.

As a researcher, Protocols was a book I needed to go through. While presenting itself as ""Jewish,"" I'm amazed by the similarities I find, in outlook and method, with any number of anti-democratic totalitarian systems, with American Progressivism, Statist Secular Socialism, and even with Islamic political fundamentalism. One could replace many Jewish references with some other entity and recognize historic examples of what the Protocols convey, likely because the book presents the workings of evil. Evil finds its home in the human heart, in the human condition. Thus, no single people group escapes its touch and the Protocols can apply to many throughout history. Assume it was not of Jewish authorship and origination. The author would need to be intimate with the workings of evil him or her self to create the work. We meet ourselves.

I realize the book's fame is anchored to some Islamic promotion, yet the concept of ""freedom"" found on pages 51, 65, and 97 (in my copy), for example, is a similar concept, a similar view of freedom, as that found in Islam (freedom according to Shariah, harmony, and as outlined by Islamic thinkers like Seyyid Qutb). So, before one throws stones, one should examine his or her own system and see how Protocols speaks to it.

Not everyone needs to read the Protocols, and those who do should, perhaps, labor to see its wider implications.",1295654400,,1852,4.967741935483871
2558581,3,B000FAOCF4,"Interesting theory.  However, the DVD ""The Illuminati Protocols of Zion: The Plot Against Israel by Doc Marquis is way more accurate.",1285632000,,133,5.333333333333333
2558582,5,B000FAOCF4,"I know so many otherwise intelligent and sensible human beings who believe that 9/11 was ""an inside job."" Guys by the bushel buy this idiocy and even post a cut and paste a symbol on their youtube pages to represent their take on the historical event (which they thought was fabricated). The view of the 9/11 ""truther"" seems ubiquitous. Personally, I cannot even remotely understand how they could take such a position. I am grateful that Marc Levin made this documentary because the absurdity of the ""inside job"" perspective needs to be brought to the public's attention. Actually, believe it or not, I had to explain to several people that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were written by the Tsar's Okhrana (secret police), but this explanation appears to be too obvious for them to accept. Alas, anti-Semitism is a creed that will never die and is more popular now than it was at the turn of the last century. Levin does well to highlight the morons who believe in this rubbish, but morons initiated the holocaust...and they may well be the ones who initiate a new one in the decades to come.",1281225600,,1099,4.670103092783505

2558584,2,B000FAOCF4,"My wife and I checked Protocols of Zion out from our local library. The synopsis on the case looked good, so we both had high expectations. When we logged on to Amazon.com and checked the reviews, we were disappointed to see that people who had seen the film did not like it. We then watched the film. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the reviewers; you can skip this film and not miss anything.

Director Marc Levin investigates the resurgence of anti-Semitism in the 2000s. He discusses the famous forgery The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and what it reveals about anti-Semites and their paranoia.

The basic problem with this film is that it has nothing original to say. Director Marc Levin does some interviews with various people who agree that the Protocols are true and with those who work to combat anti-Semitism. The film starts off pretty well, but it soon becomes very boring and repetitive. Levin puts various members of his family in the film; I thought that the ""family"" scenes were especially tedious.

We also had a couple of other quibbles. The audio was distorted and we had to turn the volume up to hear the film. (There are no captions). Also, the DVD contains several previews and it was not possible to skip them by going straight to the disc menu.

In summary, I recommend that potential viewers skip this film.",1255219200,9,1348,4.675105485232067
2558585,4,B000FAOCF4,"Not much can be analysed in any issue of biological hatred, in this case grounded very much on revelling religious dogmas as all run of human history testifies.

Probably, that is why providing the interviews without own comments was a very good idea of the Jewish American depicting co-citizens of opposite ideology, victims of oppression they suffered by themselves.

In EXTRAS a ""product of a Cold War epoch"" himself, a moviemaker was mentioning something of a France-linked original ""Protocols "". Maybe, it would be handy to clarify, that this opus was a creation of the European advanced minds and could be traced down to the time of the French Revolution as translation into Russian, published in tsar Russian Moldova at the end of 19th century, just brought about a ""second breath"" to this monument of anti-Semitism.

I think it is an interesting and educative work because most recent blasts in Jakarta and islamists non-stop terrorism in Algeria, Macedonia, Africa-less known to a broad public of a CIVILIZED world- could hardly blame any Jew on eventuating.

It is really near impossible to find a text of ""Protocols"" of which quotations have in place been used by producers.",1247875200,,1185,5.030612244897959
2558586,2,B000FAOCF4,"Having been a student of the conspiracy view of history since 1980, I was interested to see if the DVD would live up to the title.  It doesn't.  A comment on the front cover by the  New York Post states ""A valuable and frightening survey of contemporary anti-semitism"". That is exactly what is offered. A series of interviews with some of the most uninformed and poorly educated Americans who see the Jews behind all which is bad including 911, is the majority of the story.  There is a brief reference to the origins of the Protocols but the three main issues are totally ignored.  What are the Protocols?  All of these can be found on line but the DVD is supposed to answer this and it doesn't.  What possible linkage with the dancing Israelis of 911 fame is utterly lost. The dancing Israelis in fact are presented in such a way as to raise more questions about their activities.  They videoed the 911 attacks and are seen on the video claiming they wanted to film a documentary on terror in America.  The reason they just happened to be on site when the WTC attack happened is not explained.  The second question which no one has even attempted to answer is this. If the Protocols are a forgery as is claimed, then what is it which they are a forgery of?  A forged banknote is an illegal copy of a real one.  This is never even hinted at.  My own view is the Protocols is that they are most certainly real and the clever trick the writers have played on the public is to introduce the concept of the Elders being Jews and the Goys being non Jewish.  Substitute the elders for the Principalities and Powers spoken of in the Bible and the Goyim for the human race and all of a sudden the scales fall off and the Matrix is revealed.  The film DVD is poorly edited and as a serious piece of investigative film journalism fails badly to score points.  Another question which needs to be asked and never is is: WHY is it always the Jews who are singled out for persecution?  From the 1 million dead in AD 70 to the expulsions from England to the 6 million of  WWII the question of why people hate Jews is not dealt with.  Perhaps it is simply the Principalities and Powers, furious that the Seed of David came from this small insignificant tribe from Palestine, wish to eradicate their memory. They will not succeed.  I wish the producers would make a second version and deal with the issues  as the Title suggests they do.",1239926400,2,2421,4.395505617977528
2558587,1,B000FAOCF4,"I saw this trash yesterday. Here is what you need to know:

1. It is not about the Protocols, although at random (it seems) intervals he plays a cassette tape with a southern ""preacher"" type voice reading one of the ""protocols"". He obviously used that voice to convey that you are hearing a ignorant backwoods redneck, therefore whatever he reads outloud must be garbage. What struck me is that most of the protocols that Mr. Levin played and printed at the bottom of the screen have actually taken place since the Protocols first appeared. Did Mr. Levin not understand this?

2. Mr. Levin and his father, you will find out as you watch the movie, are Communists. Note first the framed picture of Che in the hallway of his father's house, then later during the ""peace"" (hate Bush) rally the elder Levin explains to the younger that he was raised ""right"" as a member of the ""commune"". Watch and listen for yourself, it is kind of sick, he basically said he brainwashed him [his son] as a youth. Note the ""Hate Bush"" Jews screaming foul language during the ""Peace"" march. Note also these are old men, not young drunk kids.

3. Mr. Levin Sr. (the father) stands in front of his childhood home and explains that on his way home from religion school (Hebrew) as a child of 10, he had to pass a RC church, one day he told God to ""go to hell"" {across from this church} and waited for God to get him. God didn't, therefore he was an Atheist since. My question right away is: Did he think God lived in the RC church? He didn't challenge God at any Jewish place, he must have believed that the God his people were training him about was dead. What other conclusion could he have had? He also makes fun of Catholics going to confession and making the sign of the cross, etc. He (the older Levin) shows a very ugly side of himself, not for the first or last time in the film.

4. Mr. Levin is somehow able to get Larry David (Seinfeld), Norman Lear (60's & 70's situation comedy producer), and ""Meathead"" Rob Reiner on the telephone, although we are only allowed to hear Mr. Levin's end of the conversation. If true, it makes me wonder. If I went to Hollywood and tried to phone an Roman Catholic I don't think the famous would talk to me.

5. Note whenever someone tries to state that the ""Jews"" are behind something, Mr. Levin will try to point out that they should be hating Bush and Cheney. He does it many times.

I must say, don't waste your time and money on this. It really has nothing of value to a normal person in it, and if you thought you would find out anything of value about the Protocols (pro or con) you won't. It is purely New York Communist Party Jewish propaganda.",1232755200,6,2673,4.379032258064516
2558588,2,B000FAOCF4,"This documentary has one fatal flaw: The person who put it together - Levin. No doubt, an examination of the Protocols as well as modern anti-semitism in America is a topic worthy of a good, objective documentary. Levin's problem is his own extreme-left bias and background.  It presents several problems. Most glaring is his criticism of those who buy into the Jewish Conspiracy, while at the same time, he himself buys into the Corporate Conspiracy. Levin is really no better than other conspiracy theorists, but just chooses a different conspiracy to buy into. The other major problem is that Levin is completely ill-equiped to defend Jews and Judaism.  Here is a man raised by an atheistic communist, who, except for his Bar Mitzvah, has no idea what being Jewish means, or why Judaism is worth preserving. He clearly does not understand the core issues of the Israeli-Arab conflict either. Since everything is viewed through Levin's far-left filter, the film has little value as an objective look at anti-semitism.",1232064000,6,1019,5.059523809523809

2558591,3,B000FAOCF4,"Marc Levin's documentary ""Protocols of Zion"" is an examination of how the ugly prejudice of anti-semitism continues even today. There are 3 main themes of the film- the historical origins of ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,"" claims that no Jews died in the 9/11 attacks and that Israel was behind the attacks, and the persistence of blood libel myths in Arab culture.

As to the first claim, Levin explains how the Protocols were a forgery of the Czarist secret police, and even though they were debunked as such in the the 1920s, many people stubbornly believe them even to this day. Allegedly, the ""Protocols"" is a secret document of the Jews to take over the world. Levin interviews a street vendor in New York who says that he always sells out of Protocols. Overall, however, ""Protocols"" focuses surprisingly little on the ""Protocols of the Learner Elders of Zion"" themselves.

Another main theme is the common accusation that no Jews died in the 9/11 attacks, and that 4,000 Jews didn't show up to work that day. Levin interviews many people who claim as much. The source of that claim, according to ADL President Abe Foxman, is that the Israeli Consulate-General in New York received 4,000 calls from Israelis on 9/11 asking about their relatives. From that, rumors spread and people, eager to believe in some kind of conspiracy, seized on it. It's sad how many people, even today, will embrace bigotry. The filmmaker tries to reason with these people, but to no avail.

Finally, Levin shows some disturbing footage from the Middle East that evince widespread anti-semitism. For example, TV series in Egypt and Palestine propopogate the accuracy of the Protocols and the ritual murder charge. The most heart-breaking part of all is a home video clip of a Palestinian mother talking to her 3 1/2 year-old daughter. She asks, ""do you like Jews?"" ""No."" ""Why not?"" ""They're pigs and apes."" ""Where does it say that?"" ""In our Koran."" Shameful.

I only wish ""Protocols"" had a little more focus. It's valuable in showing the persistence of prejudice, but it kept jumping from topic to topic. In addition, the filmmaker constantly being on camera occasionally distracts the narrative flow of the documentary. Overall, this is a decent film about modern prejudice that could have been better had it been better-executed.",1201478400,4,2329,4.948849104859335
2558592,3,B000FAOCF4,"I find it a damning revelation that this film was ORIGINALLY released with an interview with the 5 israeli Mossad agents that filmed the attack on the tower. One of the men actually admits on israeli television that they ""were there to document the event""; it immediately concludes that they were questioned by the FBI and released. ""Released""? After an admission that they were there to ""document the event""? That's not a mistake....that's leverage. Perhaps to the degree of what John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt are alluding to.

Listening to Mr. Ahmadinejad's respectful and insightful speech after being distastefully and vulgarly insulted by an obviously undereducated and seething with hatred university president Lee Bollinger did nothing more than reveal how shallow these people in academia and politics actually are. Last time I check a capacity for reasonableness and a determination to work toward the betterment and equality of ALL people was a foundational precept of the Constitution of the United States. Ironically that very Constitution particularly Article 1 section 10 has NOT been obeyed for the last 94 years. Circumspectly IF there were a politician worth consideration in the last 94 years he would have spoken up and demanded that the chains of bondage known as the Federal Reserve would have been abolished and faced criminal charges.

In the same way men are made slaves and controlled by MEN and POWER that interestingly enough never seem to make the front pages. To close this out I will end by saying that in later versions of this dvd the interview with the israelis that ADMIT being in New York for the express purpose of ""documenting the event"" has been removed.

If there is no shame, no ill intentions, no crazy 'conspiracy theory' then why alter the 'facts' Mr. Levin so elaborately put together?

Truth needs no rewrite. no convincing. Truth reveals itself the wise understand it.",1190592000,3,1918,5.079365079365079
2558593,5,B000FAOCF4,"I am a big fan of the genre, and I can say without qualification that this is a very well-made documentary.  The subject matter is both chilling and mystifying.  Marc Levin demonstrates that no matter how many times they've been debunked the ""Protocols"" continue to be cited by anti-Semites old and new, domestic and international.  Following 9/11 the manufacture of new myths surrounding the Jews gives us, through Levin's lens, a fascinating if disturbing opportunity to witness the development of this kind of lie first-hand.  It is a briskly made film with its fair share of humor, but it definitely leaves you with something less than a smile on your face.  I highly recommend it.",1179446400,3,685,4.921739130434783

That's what this film does with anti-semitism.  It talks about a document called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and examines it in detail.  This document is discredited and is believed only by the kooks and flakes of the world. And it's those flakes that this film goes to great pains to seek out and interview.

And so Levin ""proves"" that there is rampant antisemitism in the United States. Whatever.",1173398400,12,637,4.651785714285714
2558596,1,B000FAOCF4,"Ever Again was not a particularly well done documentary, but it's a work of genius compared to this drivel.  It seems most of the other reviewers have been soft on this film because it is against the evil of Antisemitism.  This  film fails to make a coherent argument.  The director jumps from scene to scene with no flow or direction.  There are numerous tangents that go nowhere.  The director likes to hear himself talk and ends up in verbal fights with idiots while he spouts stupid platitudes.  Worst of all, the director seems to believe in a great all encompassing corporate conspiracy not much different than that expoused by The Protocols.",1170115200,27,648,4.783783783783784
2558597,4,B000FAOCF4,"""Protocols of Zion"" takes a somewhat convulted view on modern, post-9/11 anti-Semitism in the world, using the nefarious fabrication of the ""Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" as a template.

Much of the film doesn't reflect much on the actual screed itself, but rather the modern world's Jew hatred. The new anti-Jewish myth is no Jews died at 9/11.

Get ready for some intense dialogue. Ironically, some of the most hateful remarks in the film come from participants in a peace rally. An older man states he'd rather go to hell than be in heaven with ""f----"" Bush and Cheney. This is opposed to the spokesman from the Natonal Alliance in his tacky red tie speaking plainly about their beliefs and operations. Actually, some of the best, most honest and rational sounding people in the whole film are convicts at a maximum security prison.

One of several scens that bothered me was the interview with young Palestinian-Americans. They were born Americans, but still so wrapped up in the affairs of the ""old country."" I had to wonder why this was, especially in the wake of so many others, like the Irish, the Poles, the Italians, the Chinese, etc. who worked to become Americans and never looked back. And then hearing these guys start talking like gangstas didn't make the situation any better.

The worst moment was definitely the interview on the Passion with James Carroll. Aside from that, it was worth the look.",1162339200,8,1425,4.827868852459017
2558598,4,B000FAOCF4,"I give this DVD four stars, not three, because the topic, the universal irrational antisemitism championed by a bogus conspiracy called the ""Protocols of Zion,"" is a compelling topic, especially in a post 9/11 world where people actually embrace the crackpot belief that the Israelis, the Jews, ""did 9/11,"" and that no Jews were killed in the World Trade Center. Sadly, the filmmaker spends too much time interviewing marginal people who are obviously loons. More chilling is when he focuses on people with credibility who embrace the same deranged beliefs.",1159574400,8,557,5.2
2558599,2,B000FAOCF4,"I am an American Jew who has lived in Israel for years. Levin (the film maker) did not do his homework, or perhaps was incapable of seeing truths his politics refuses to acknowledge. He is incapable of rising above his left-wing prejudices, and the film - as film has a tendency to do - shows the fly-in-the-ointment. It's such a pity, because so few efforts are made to expose this subject. He trots out Kofi Annan as a voice of reason. The head of the UN, who only months before (on Palestine Day), presided over a map of Israel in the ceremony in which ALL of Israel was Arab! In other words, millions of Jews would be displaced, murdered or made second-class citizens in their own homeland by the smiling Kofi and the rest of the Jew-hating world. But the UN, with its anti-American, Israel hating population is the darling of the left, so what's a leftist Levin to do? Israel is the only country in the UN NOT having a rotating place on the security Council. I wonder why? No other country in the world would put up with a hostile population the way Israel has. Levin could have shown the FACTS concerning Israel, but like most left-wing Jews, is embarrassed by a strong Jewish state. He is basically, a typically prosperous American Yiddel.

He makes sure a poster of Che Gueverra is shown prominently with his family units. He smears  the memory of the 6,000,000 by bringing in his super-left pals who decide (in knowing more than God?); that  they'd rather be in hell than in a heaven with George Bush.

In doing so, he shows as little regard for the truth as the anti-semites he interviews.

He ends with a rather foolish staement that God would have us ""do good."" Is it too ""deep"" for Mr. Levin to realize that the suicide bombers and the people cutting off heads are sure they are also ""doing good?"" There is a saying in Hebrew, ""rosh katan."" It means  ""small mind."" This is such a shame, because Jew hatred is a worldwide disease, and we need a fearless surgeon to expose it, not an effete left-winger.",1157846400,16,2014,4.4890710382513666
8119806,1,B000FAOCF4,"Nothing frustrates me more than an uneducated person. Many of the people he interviewed had some thoughtful and honest points they addressed. Overall, however, the film was one-sided. Levin couldn't wrap his mind around facts he attempted to disguise as opinions. While I don't ascribe to the silly idea that no jews died on 9/11, there is much more that could've been done in this film with simple discovery. Boring and a waste of time.",1494892800,,437,4.84
8119807,5,B000FAOCF4,"This documentary is far better than many of the reviewers concede. What one sees here that seems to miff some folks is simply the creativity of the author/producer. For while the name may seem misleading to some, in fact it is really planting the seeds for where the story begins. It is an anchor around which the thesis -- ongoing anti-Semitism in America and the absurd notion that ""somehow"" Israel (i.e. ""the Jews"") were responsible for the attacks of Sept. 11th, 2001 -- can be developed. One only has to look at the cover of the video container to see the relationship between the title and where Marc Levin wants to take the viewer. Some people call it disjointed. Well, I saw a progression of modern comparisons with various parts of the original czarist forgery (The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion). So perhaps what folks need to realize is that the progression of the story is not linear. I use this video as a college history professor and the response I have gotten is totally positive. The post-screening discussions that are held are evidence of that. This is a documentary, made by a very competent filmmaker and his late father, that all folks interested in issues like the Holocaust, or Sept. 11th, 2001, or any study of racism, prejudice, and just how ignorant people who spout such hatred really are, should see. As far as those who've complained in their reviews about the poor sound quality of the video they purchased, well, I'm sorry to hear that. I bought my copy from Amazon when it first came out and the sound on my copy works fine. The point of a review, as I understand it, concerns the content of the presentation -- not a manufacturer's flaw on the video disk. Buy or borrow this video and watch it to learn something important that all Americans need to be aware of concerning the ongoing ignorance and hatred prevalent in our country.

8119811,3,B000FAOCF4,"This is a frustrating documentary that could have been so much better. Given the title, I had expected an in-depth look at the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious forgery concocted by the Tsarist police in the late 19th century which purported to show the Jews were plotting world domination and would stop at nothing to achieve their aims. Director Marc Levin though veers off course almost from the start (a pattern he will sadly repeat throughout the film) as he prefers to talk about anti-Semitism in the United States and why so many people seem ready to believe the worst about the Jews. Occasionally one of the protocols will be read out on screen and then Levin is off on another tangent. He finds people happy to spout all sorts of drivel about how Jews want to rule the world and how all Jewish employees who worked in the World Trade Center were warned to stay away on 9/11. This is pretty reprehensible stuff, yet it isn't particularly new, and Levin has trouble linking these ludicrous comments to the Protocols. He heads off to Virginia to talk to a white supremacist who sells Nazi flags and other memorabilia and then we flick back to long (and not very interesting conversations) with Levin's father. We're shown brief excerpts of a crude recreation of the Protocols which was (I think this is correct) shown on Egyptian television and then we're off somewhere else. There is no structure at all to this documentary and by the end I was pretty frustrated. I learned quite a bit about white supremacism, and anti-Semitism in general (the clip from a 1940 Nazi film equating Jews with rats is horrific), but Levin fails in his main tasks of making the story coherent and linking it firmly to the Protocols, which remain a mystery. Who exactly drew them up? Why? We never really learn.",1363046400,,1808,4.670846394984326
