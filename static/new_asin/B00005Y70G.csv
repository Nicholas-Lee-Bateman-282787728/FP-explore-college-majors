7956879,1,B00005Y70G,Couldn't play this DVD. It is now advertised as not playable on many players but I bought it too soon. Whoops and sorry.,1357689600,,120,4.260869565217392
7956880,2,B00005Y70G,"It has a cooler yet very pathetic story that was not well put together and this film lacks the funny scenes that the original had and instead they use really stupid actions from very dumbfounded characters! The special effects and the way people die are just so stupid and farfetched! But the film did have a few things going for it such as a returning character (Jennifer Ritchkoff), some gorier scenes that have part one shedding a tear, and a better killer clown mask... but most of it was worn down by its bad dialogue!

Plot: After the grisly events from part one of the Camp Blood Trilogy a film director approaches the survivor of the whole ordeal and wants her to be executive producer and to let the actors know how she felt when the killings started and ended (Which she does a terrible job doing because she doesn't ever do anything except recall flashbacks)! She sees it as a way to leave the asylum that she was admitted to and accepts the offer. Now with his so called $130 million budget he meets the cast with his two man crew (one who is an alcoholic and the other is a pot head) and they begin to make the movie. But the killings never ended instead they grew! Now the team soon realizes that they are being chased and slaughtered by a killer that isn't clowning around! Can Tricia (Jennifer Ritchkoff) save what is left of the team or even try to stop this new killer that wants only revenge!

Review: Phew that plot stinks and it reeks of bad story build up and just dreaded story in general! Now that I have got that out of my system I must say that this did feel more like a slasher flick than the fist mainly due to the bloodier and a more frequent towards the end kind of body count! The first two victims don't even make sense though, because they are never explored or even mentioned in the rest of the movie and even one of the deaths they person dies from having his hand chopped off... I know that if no medical attention was acquired for this poor soul then he would eventually die but this person dies in like 10-15 seconds and the individual barley even screams!!! I do like though how they did more with this movie and how the killer ""gets rid of the competition"" to be apart of this massacre or should I say cause this massacre. They really knew what they wanted to do with this sequel especially considering it was made in a little less than half a year! This movie is especially a good watch because it has a helluvalot of entertainment and cheap thrills that give us a lot of bloody bodies to help boost the interest of the viewer even if the deaths are incredibly unrealistic!

Acting: This is ridiculous... the first one tried acting all serious but failed and this time it tries to be stupid-funny and fails yet again! The worst set up I believe that the one of the characters endured was when the ""Director"" (whom was played by Garret Clancy) was all attracted and in love with the girl (mostly because of her breasts) that got the part to play Jennifer Ritchkoff role and then the next day when she didn't show he acted like he never even heard of the actresses name! It had ridiculous acting and overall dreaded dialogue.... especially when the people portraying the original victims for the movie acted that's when I thought I couldn't take anymore!

Gore: an off-screen slit throat is what starts up the movie and then the machete through the stomach to kick off the last death until the 40-50 minute mark! After that we get the dreaded hand chopped off with a machete scene, a guy is sliced and diced like crazy with a machete, a woman gets a machete impaled through her face and out her head (because... where else would it go... I'm kidding and using very bad sarcasm to go along with it, were was I, oh yeah) that death actually looked good and I was quite surprised, we also get a machete sliced into ones head (with smoke, yes I said it smoke coming out of his head... along with a lot of blood, he must've been very aggravated because that was the scene when everyone left the set and the director was getting very angry and then *Spoiler Alert* gets his steaming demise *End Spoiler*), a cool looking throat slashing, a piece of shard glass from a bottle is shoved into a mans eyes, a burnt face, a machete sliced into a victims neck and more... there is a very hilarious scene where the alcoholic (Shemp, I wonder where they got that name from *Hint* Evil Dead *End Hint*) punches a girl because he was confused and drunk and she was screaming and I guess it just pissed him off to much!

Bottom Line: Director Brad Sykes is very talented in doing what he does and with what he has. There was another dislike I had about this movie and it was that pretty much all the character names from part one were used in part two for totally different characters.... one other thing I liked how ever was the whole revenge theme that unfolds at the end.. .it was very well played out and that's what made it feel more like a true and serious slasher flick!

Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong violence and gore, some sexuality/nudity, and language

7956881,2,B00005Y70G,"If you can get a 3d copy of this movie then skip part one altogether as the only good parts of the first show up here and they barely knew what they were doing in that first project. I mean what kind of 3d film shows a marshmellow going into the flame from behind someones shoulder? You're supposed to point it at the camera ,you nitwit that's what makes it pop out! Basically the main reason to watch this empty headed opus is for the gory effects and to see what this commercially available 3d lens can do for any standard or digital camcorder. If these Bozos can make a 3d film with an almost non existant budget think what you can do with your drunken friends and a yo-yo expert. Buy this as a what not to do film and enjoy the goofy gore coming out of the screen.

this movi may be made by my favorite B-movie company and thats the only reason I payed 2 dollars for this. Dead-Alive which released Meet the Feebles My favorite movie made by Peter Jackson (The Frightners, Lord of the rings) but this movie is literly terrible it is almost as bad as a kick in the nuts.",1036108800,,332,4.370967741935484
7956883,3,B00005Y70G,"movie worthy of 3 stars but thats about it.  at least the murder scenes are above average, otherwise a decent movie, especially for a low budget film.  what's with the cast of the movie though?
the director's assistant is a drunk and looks up all the girl's skirts?  and the director sure didn't have much of a crew or cast, very very unrealistic.  think they could have done a much better job on this movie thats for sure.  i'm sure there will be plenty of sequeals though considering the amount of people that think their going to be cult classics.",1027814400,,550,4.46
7956884,3,B00005Y70G,"PLOT: Our ""hero"" from the last Camp Blood (her name escapes me) has survived and been aucussed of the murders. She now spends her time at the local nut house. A ""director"" (Note quotations for sarcasim) wants to make movie about the Camp Blood murders. He gets the girl out of the asylum and goes to Camp Blood to film. All of the sudden one by one the cast is being killed off. The clown is back and she's (whoops I mean he's ... or do I ???) out for vengence.
STRAIGHT TALK: Seriously how easy could this mystery be. I knew who the killer was with in the first 20 minutes. It so obvious. I won't tell but if it surprises you, you are not even worthy to see ""this"" movie. If you've seen the first Camp Blood this is pretty much the same. Same...picture. Same... effects and same...killer.
CAST: What a whopper! I really liked the pot smoking effects guy. And the beer drinking ass. director. Besides that it sucks.
KILLS: The famous Camp Blood machete goes to work with some stabs to the head,chest,throat and mouth. Pretty good kills considering the movie.
CONCLUSION: This was o.k. Not bad, not good. Like I said, it's almost too obvious who the clown is in this one. Just see if you can figure it out. If you got some money left over and wanna see a bad movie rent this one or its predecessor.",1026950400,,1297,4.319672131147541
