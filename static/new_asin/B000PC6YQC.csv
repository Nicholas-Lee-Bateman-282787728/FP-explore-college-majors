2815421,5,B000PC6YQC,"The characters are fresh, the plots creative; I wouldn't call this another sitcom.  It is long, about 559 minutes and I would like to have seen more.  The main characters are not Hollywood beautiful, they're ordinary, but incredibly talented.  William is an undertaker, but the show has no undertaker jokes.  What a concept!  See this.",1211500800,8,335,5.0181818181818185
2815422,5,B000PC6YQC,"If you're tired of detectives, lawyers, policemen, and neurotic housewives,
you'll find William & Mary totally refreshing and delightful! We laughed and
we cried, and we absolutely Loved the characters - what more can you ask?",1209686400,51,226,5.305555555555555
2815423,5,B000PC6YQC,"This is a charming series about the ups and downs of a pair of single parents who meet through a dating service and manage to make things work despite many misunderstandings, aborted plans, eccentric relatives, unusual professions, and teenage problems.  However, lest you get the wrong idea, this is not a British version of The Brady Bunch, thank God. It is a well-written, funny, poignant and fast-moving saga of people trying to get together and make a go of their relationship.  In the process they have to deal with, among others, a wacked-out and really irritating mother (the bride's), a decent but rather clueless ex-boyfriend, a not-so-decent and intrusive ex-husband (maybe), four teenagers of varying irritation quotients and their own professional problems.  My only criticism of the series is that there are a seemingly endless number of childbirth scenes (the heroine being a midwife and all) which get a bit repetitive after a  while.  Otherwise, a very entertaining and endearing series with excellent performances by all, especially Martin Clunes.  Highly recommended.",1199059200,72,1086,5.321637426900585
2815424,5,B000PC6YQC,"As a midwife, I have no time to watch television  - but I watched this series, every minute of it - and loved it. It was alternately warm, funny, silly, ridiculous, predictable, not predictable, and wonderful! In addition, with the exception of one very short segment, it portrayed the life of a midwife extraordinarily well. The writing was terrific, and the juxtaposition of Mary's work as a midwife, and William's work as an undertaker, especially in episodes 6 and 7(or was it 7 and 8?!)was brilliant. The acting is great and the characters (okay, Mary's mother is a little overdone!) engaging. The development of the relationship between William and Mary is outstanding, and her portrayal of midwifery noteworthy. I made time to see every episode, and it was well worth it each time -relaxing, fun and touching. My partner liked it, too - when it was all over, he asked if now I would sit and watch 12 episodes  of something like ""The Terminator"" with him - of course, the answer was no! - but he actually was the one who would often say to me, ""So, do you want to watch the next William and Mary tonight?""",1188864000,95,1111,4.606060606060606
2815425,5,B000PC6YQC,I love Martin Clunes. This series is really great. Almost as good as Doc Martin and that is a high compliment. I have enjoyed this series very much and even shared it with my relatives who feel the same way. Anything that Martin Clunes is in is just excellent. I think I am in love.,1423872000,,282,4.1454545454545455

2815430,5,B000PC6YQC,"Wish Season Three was available separately (and at a fair price)!  I have this (1&2) but all I've been able to find, when looking to add Season 3, is a combo-set of all 3 Seasons.  Why do they do that:  punish those who fall in love with the series, gotta have it & purchase before the series has wrapped up???  :)  But is a wonderful story, real problems, real evolution of family dynamics and very honest, struggling, coping, failing yet trying to do it right adults (and kids).

And it seems that Season 3 is not in a format compatible with U.S. DVD players?  Is this correct??  I can't find access to the technical aspects of this DVD.",1411689600,,639,4.3559322033898304
2815431,5,B000PC6YQC,Loved this series. I'm waiting for more. This was something I decided to watch after watching the Doc Martin series. Martin Clunes plays a much nicer character in the series. It's a fun series about relationships.,1410307200,,213,4.944444444444445

2815433,2,B000PC6YQC,The reason I do not like this is it is so action packed with details of lives lived with everything thrown at the cast you can imagine. I thought after seasons of viewing the ending was as I expected. The mess of lives in general was un nerving and I like movies that take me away from the stress of the world not put me smack dab in the middle of such drama much of which was self inflicted. So this was a mistake for me to buy. If you like drama and stress by all means get it.,1408147200,,479,3.8484848484848486

Like others,love that Martin Clunes is smiling in this show. He's such a charming,caring man,as in extras for Doc Martin. Could tell he was somewhat stockier in W & M due to quitting smoking. This is a truly lovely show,comedy,tragedy,great characters.",1403654400,,372,5.114754098360656

It is without a doubt one of the most uplifting, funny, touching, crazy and sweet ""sitcoms""  ever been made, quite appropriate for the daily life of raising kids, but especially for people who have blended families.  This is a keeper, and Martin Clunes is a lovely man is this, not the jerk he is in Doc Martin.  My husband and I watch it about once a year and are always delighted to own it.  We have recommended it to many people, everybody raves afterwards.  It's absolutely great!",1398643200,,559,4.431372549019608

2815460,1,B000PC6YQC,"Everyone did their job as an actor, really very good acting. But, and this is a big ""but"" nothing about the writing seems to jell or even make sense much of the time....""Mary's"" former husband/boyfriend screws up their wedding day but a short while later he is back in the family's good graces....how likely is that to happen in real life?! Sorry, but too much ""suspension of disbelief"" for me to tolerate. Also, although I love the two lead actors they have ZERO on-screen chemistry. I never found them to be a believable romantic pair....Mary is too raw and edgy to be a smooth fit with William's super gentle demeanor. I must say I adore Martin Clunes as Doc Martin and Caroline Catz's Louisa, a much better pairing with great screen chemistry and fantastic writing that just keeps you wanting more. Not here though, not by a long shot. And many of the William-Mary scenes would have benefitted from more substantial editing. I found it insufferably slow at times.",1393545600,,967,4.727810650887574

My sister did say that it's a bit slow at the beginning, and then picks up, but she hasn't been able to finish it.

2815464,5,B000PC6YQC,"I have never seen a better or more entertaining series...one of Clunes best!  I even bought the
multi regional player so I could see the last 8 episodes and I watch this over and over again.
It's not just the story line and the excellent acting...the music is wonderful thru out...and who
knew Clunes could sing?  And even if he cant he sure pulled off ""Little Angel Mine"" brilliantly.
He even pulled off a operatic duet in French with his R& B band partner and his voice
was not dubbed.  This series is my all time favorite...the English really know how to do it.
This country is so far behind them in the entertainment industry it is ridiculous.",1389398400,2,647,4.466101694915254
2815465,5,B000PC6YQC,"I became a fan of Clunes from Doc Martin. When Amazon showed me this series, I ordered it immediately. My husband and I couldn't stop watching once we started. This show is full of humor and warmth. Sounds hokey and cliche I know, but in one episode you can go from laughing to crying, and back again. I highly recommend.",1388275200,,321,4.366666666666666

2815478,2,B000PC6YQC,"This series started out as a promising story of a mature relationship and blended families. It progressed into a self indulgent soap opera. The third season, which is not in this set, was by far the worst. For some reason by season 2 the writers and/or cast decided that each episode must feature a funeral juxtaposed with a screaming birth accompanied by the not so dulcet tones of Martin Clunes and ""the boys in the band"". Then there were the prerequisite semi nude, demi sex scenes featuring everyone in the cast at some time or other. The most unappealing aspect of this series for me was the sullen, judgmental, unforgiving character of Mary who always found fault with others from William, to her children, to her mother, to every doctor who dared question her decisions as a midwife.",1386979200,2,790,4.731884057971015
2815479,5,B000PC6YQC,"This was an exceptional DVD series and we did a marathon weekend special devouring all episodes over the course of two days and night. They were highly entertaining, funny, and had an unpredictable plot. I wish the story would have continued. The character roles were extraordinary and and brought great credit to Marin Clunes and his co star (Julie Graham). This series was as good as it gets ! I highly recommend the set !",1386892800,,424,4.666666666666667
2815480,4,B000PC6YQC,This series promises interesting and diverse characters with humorous as well as real life situations.  So glad it is now captioned on Acorn TV for those of us with hearing impairments.,1386806400,,185,4.967741935483871
2815481,5,B000PC6YQC,I love this series.  Its about a funeral director who finds a woman through a dating service.  He is not at all what you would expect in a funeral director and its interesting to see the English traditions of funerals and the different ways people are sent off.  The backgrounds between Mary and William are entirely different and its interesting to see how they manage to merge their social backgrounds and families.,1385683200,,417,4.763888888888889
2815482,4,B000PC6YQC,"Most of the series was great, but towards the end everything kept going wrong wrong wrong. Over doing the desperating scenes of despair can make anyone depress.

2815486,3,B000PC6YQC,"I'm a big fan of Martin Clunes, but this just didn't do much for me. I love him in ""Doc Martin"" and it's interesting to see him play a very different role, but still, the series just wasn't that great. He plays the part of an undertaker dating a woman who just strikes me as not the right match for him. I lost interest in the show.",1380153600,3,332,3.970149253731343

A heartwarming, quirky story of two people who fall in love in spite of many misunderstandings, interruptions, and seemingly impossible situations. It's a great story where love conquers all in spite of everyone's flaws and all the obstacles in the way. Julie Graham and Martin Clunes also have great chemistry together, which certainly enhances the fun of watching this series. I was disappointed that, though there is a third series, it is not apparently available in American DVD!

With the actors involved (Martin Clunes and Julie Graham), this show should have been good.......and with Mary a midwife and William an undertaker, there should have been some great story lines.  However, for me it just wasn't there.  The stories were more annoying than entertaining.  The teenagers involved were not interesting, just disgusting kids, and the relationship between William and Mary was not worth the time spent.  Between William and Mary's love life and their not-so-good-looking naked bodies, the low-life teenagers, the high-brow/low-brow relationship between the main characters, and the more-than-annoying women in the throes of childbirth, I feel that this series is a waste of time.

2815536,5,B000PC6YQC,"William & Mary are a little different. He is a funeral director and she is a midwife with more concern for her patients than her superiors. William resorts to a dating agency and hiding his profession to date a nice woman. After all, he owns his own business, plays in a rock band, sings in his church choir and has two wonderful daughters, what's not to like? Mary also has two kids-boys who are always keeping their mom on the run.
Despite the trials that both families face and they are big adventures, they fall in love and make one great family.

William & Mary are not your usual touchy squeazy couple tho. They face problems and trials out of the norm for American lovers. They are Brits and it is a different culture over there. Life is a little more raw; but, but just as funny on occasion as American life is. Mary's Mother and ex-husband make every day fun and sometimes touching. This series was a great show for me and my husband. We laughed through some episodes and talked about all of them. In fact we couldn't wait to see each new day in their lives. When the end of the series came we felt like we were leaving friends. You will love these people and this series. I promise.",1352851200,2,1192,4.345291479820628

2815573,5,B000PC6YQC,"Fantastic British romance / comedy / drama about a midwife and an undertaker who meet through an online dating service and blend their two diverse (and I mean DIVERSE) families into one life together while dealing with the beginnings and endings of life itself.  Very well plotted, very well written, and perfectly acted - this show is a true joy on every level.  I literally laughed out loud on many occasions and I literally had tears well up in my eyes on several occasions as well.  While there is a bit of (realistic) getting-to-know-you drama between the two principle characters, every episode explores some truly deep aspects of the human condition framed through the occupations of our heroes.  Usually there is no good or pat or tidy ""solution"" presented - just like in real life.  The most immersive aspect of this show is its near-total realism.

The main storyline of the romance between William and Mary is superb.  Who wouldn't like Mary?  But the genius of the show is definitely William, who comes off as a bit plain and boring and even a bit creepy in the beginning, then truly soars by blossoming characterwise into a wonderful, inspiring Everyman.  The backup ongoing storylines - the randy stepchildren, the over-the-top mother-in-law, the ups and downs of the family business (and the family story behind it) - are all pitch perfect.

For a change, compared to many British shows I've watched, I could actually understand the dialogue despite there being a continuous mixture of  accents.  Viewing this with American eyes is an interesting experience indeed, seeing an apparently realistic portrayal of the everyday London lifestyle and glimpses of how the different English, Scottish and Irish members of the UK all view each other.

There is a third season of this show which is not available on a region 1 (United States) DVD, but which has been graciously placed on YouTube in 10 minute chunks (each chunk ends at where the commecial break would be) by a British W&M fan.  Trust me, after viewing this DVD set as an American viewer, you will immediately be hightailing it over to YouTube to see what happens next on the ""tantracecilia"" channel.",1340755200,,2170,4.89344262295082
2815574,4,B000PC6YQC,"I enjoy watching William and Mary very much, I've watched it over several times and keep finding bits I've missed.
The only thing I don't like about this story is that William and Mary slept together on their first date, I think that part was icky, they made it so casual.
The other thing about it that I don't care for is, whoever came up with this story, made Mary's character sort of trashy, not someone you'd think William's character would want to be with (in real life anyway).
Once you get passed these two things its fun to watch.
This story is NOT for children or even impressionable teenagers. I would never want to give a young girl the thought that this kind casual sex leads to love and marriage,because it doesn't, and thats exactly what girls are thinking about.

The storyline is interesting, the scripts are very well written and very entertaining, and the acting is really outstanding. However, buyer beware that after watching season one and season two, I now know that the complete William and Mary is a three-season storyline compilation--This purchase only includes season one and season two--which is OK because it is what I purchased, but, season three (with the final episodes) is apparently only available for purchase outside of the USA market.  So, my family and I got hooked on something really good, but we are debating whether or not I would have made this purchase in the first place, now knowing we may never see the season three conclusion of the story.  If this should change, i.e., season three becomes available, I will update my review.

The writing and development of the characters is refreshing. The storyline is unique. This is a series that make you feel good without being sappy, sugar coated, and insulting your intelligence. There is a lot of quality in its production. (There were occasional exception of `loose-ends' being tied more smoothly than they would in real life, but to have them not would have been a disappointment.)

I was not able to get Season 3, however. I had to go to Amazon UK and buy Region 2 just to get the complete series. (Make sure you have the right DVD player.) If you are a serious BBC watcher as I am, you will already  own one.",1312502400,4,808,4.337748344370861

The William character played by Martin Clunes is sympathetic and one feels a concern for his happiness; the Mary character played by Julie Graham is also an interesting and sympathetic character.

Both my wife and I had a problem with the contemporary life styles being portrayed in this series and felt it to be more depressing that uplifting or entertaining. As a results we do not expect to watch any more of the series. Whereas both characters seemed to exhibit a touching concern for their fellow man, the lives into which they had immersed themselves left much to be desired.

My recommendation would be to view it for yourselves as a rental before buying it. It may be you'll enjoy the series more than we did.",1298505600,8,851,4.555555555555555

This series is marked by great acting, great writing and a deeply positive view of the world.
William is an undertaker -- widowed with two teenage girls. Mary is a midwife, a single mom with two teenage boys.

2815608,2,B000PC6YQC,"I am and always have been a huge fan of Martin Clunes. I ordered all three series of ""William and Mary"" from Amazon. UK and after watching them threw them in the bin.  I do not and never have found labor pains and childbirth a topic of entertainment and had to fast forward past all those scenes.  On the other hand, death and undertaking did not offend me.  The acting of all the actors was superb and I LOVE seeing all the London views - had to draw myself back to reality after watching each episode because I felt as if I had been on a mini-vacation to the U.K.  William was such a darling man who exuded goodness and high mindedness and I thought he deserved a better partner than Mary, who was cheap and unstable.  Her mother was unbearably repulsive but I do love the actress who portrayed her and have enjoyed her acting many times through the years.  She is a real pro and deserves accolades for her performance.  The teenagers were so rude and nasty, they would have had the back of my hand for some of their comments.  All in all I found the plot ridiculous but the dialogue at times very entertaining.  To sum up,  William should have run a mile from that low class bunch.  I guess one could say I feel as if I wasted my $$$.",1287532800,16,1237,4.221276595744681

2815633,5,B000PC6YQC,"After enjoying Martin Clunes in Doc Martin, my husband and I were excited to see that he starred in another show, William and Mary.  What an excellent performance! In this show he is the complete antithesis of Doc Martin. We have just completed watching every episode and I must say how sad I am to see it over.  Why it was so short-lived, I have no idea.  It was well written, beautifully directed and superbly acted. The characters were richly drawn and so real and full of life that we immediately felt a conncetion to them.  We had seen Julie Graham in another excellent series entitled The Bone Kickers, so when we discovered William and Mary with two of our favorite actors we decided to give it a try.  Julie Graham is amazing in her portrayal of a midwife.  After seeing her as an archeologist previously we were very impressed with her range as an actor.  The supporting cast is extremely well acted also. We loved all four of the children and Mary's dear friend Doris. Since the series ended so abruptly (but on a very happy note!) there is much to be answered, however since there is happiness at the end one can only hope that the other story threads woven throughout the series find their way around to the main focus of the series....love.

The fact that this is such terrific television makes it all the more frustrating to know that there was a third season and that it has been available in non-USA format since 2005. As all too often happens, American viewers are left high and dry, waiting and hoping that it will some day be available for viewing on American DVD's.
Another Martin Clunes series, ""Doc Martin,"" seemed to take forever to bring out US format discs after making the first season available.  Likewise, ""Clatterford"" and ""My Family"" for example.

2815636,5,B000PC6YQC,"This show easily could be called ""The Best Show You've never heard of"". Modern, endearing, this light drama is a modern dramatic version of Brady Bunch mixed with Six Feet Under. William, an ""everyman"" type is a widower with two daughters and a housekeeper who owns and operates a funeral home. Mary, a divorcee, has two teen sons and is a midwife. William instantly falls for her when he picks her out in a video dating line-up... and the rest is history. Each episode is an engaging look and life and death... a story surrounding a deceased and a story about a birth.... mixed in with modern family dating hazards, a struggle to make the relationship work... finding time for each other, and dealing with the kids. Many can be emotional, but never dark... a wonderful tribute to the circle of life. Clunes, as William, is engaging, and genuine, and plays much more of an upbeat character than his other series, Doc Martin, also recommended. Graham, as Mary, plays a driven career woman, an advocate for her patients, yet fearful to fall in love again. Her mother is another central character, who is always butting in one way or another.  A ""must see"" for everyone who enjoys a modern drama with great acting and story lines. I will forewarn this is not for young viewing as some of the death plots (a baby, teens) may be a bit scary, and there are birthing scenes, and bedroom scenes. Nothing overt, but they do exist.",1252627200,11,1421,4.616600790513834

Yes, there are questions left, but really are for the writers:  there is clarity about William's [deceased] wife in just a few lines, enough said.  But not a clue about what Mary saw in the father of her children or in her last boyfriend [would hate to think she always makes poor choices since that would be an inditement of William, and we can't have that]; or why she would [working single mother that she is] have paid a dating service 700 pounds.  As the writing is excellent I know the answers could have been worked into the script.  The characters grow [including up], evolve, are ""real"" without being dysfunctional.  There is comedy, but the comedy of life rather than pratfall slapstick, which the Brits can do in embarrassing abundance.  To describe William as a ""lonely undertaker"" does no service or credit to the role.  Makes him seem one-dimensional and wierd.  The acting is superb.",1243382400,19,984,4.769230769230769

What I really hated was that they rushed their relationship so fast and that they slept together from the first date - and in every other episode that I have seen.  I'm enough of a traditional fuddy-duddy that I think it's a good idea to get to know someone well and marry them before you hop into bed with them.  I realize that doesn't happen often in real life anymore, and even less on TV, but I still think it might have been better to delay it a bit in this show.  The relationship might have developed more interestingly if it had been allowed to progress more slowly. I also was very tired, by episode 4, of the bad attitudes and mouthiness of the teenagers.

2815643,5,B000PC6YQC,"One of the most poignant, wonderful series I have seen in years. Why it didn't run more seasons is puzzling...was it too provocative? Too ""real?"" Too controversial?

It is a brilliant reflection of today's city life, and the characters are developed beautifully. One feels that s/he truly knows William and Mary (and their respective families), and cares about their lives and what happens to them. I was fully invested in their story after the first two episodes, as was my partner, an engineer who usually likes to watch science fiction.

Almost every human-life situation imaginable is addressed (single motherhood; mixed race marriages/children; being cornered into a job you weren't counting on doing; the overburdened social security system; birth/death; raising teenagers; having a nutty mom; suicide; first-time sex; absent dads; midwifery; the funeral business; transvestites, etc. etc. etc.) with poise and sensitivity, many times by showing it instead of saying it, or directly addressing it. It just is what is.

It addresses moral dilemmas, also, often leading to solutions, or a lesson learned. These were very believable dilemmas, pertinent to today's society, and for that very reason it was intriguing to see how the characters (whom one's grown to love!) dealt with the myriad challenges that life ever guarantees.

It's a show that appeals to both men and women, and I'll bet that it won't fail in completely delighting 99% of viewers. It is too adult for younger teens (I'd say parent take a look first, anyway), but for absolutely all others, it's unbeatable: engaging and touching.",1229644800,20,1603,5.25

Lots of gentle comedy, the drama isn't too preachy, not too much blood ( as many British shows do seem to have).  No typical trite misunderstandings- when something odd happens, it is mentioned and dealt with in a real way.  We wanted to parcel the viewing into weekly segments, but it was too good for that  and we ended up watching 2 or 3 per evening which meant it was over waaaay too soon!  Compelling enough for the whole family to watch- over age 12 at a guess.  I'll say it:  I love Martin Clunes!  (Ever since Men Behaving Badly) He is perfect in this.  The music is well done.  (Listen for one of my favourite Travis songs.)  The only problem is that it ended too soon.  The mix of midwife and undertaker is so natural and nicely dealt with, you never feel as if it is some crazy stilted situation.  It is believable, like normal life, only better. Some very big subjects but they let you make up your own mind, no American-style lib v conserve mind control here.",1226793600,13,1039,4.423280423280423

It seems like a precursor to the  ""Six Feet Under"" USA series.
This series must have influenced the USA version. Even the theme music sounds a bit similar. The life and challenges of an undertaker's family.
 But this series juxtaposes  Mary, a mid-wife with William,an undertaker. The challenges of blending 2 families is interlaced with a variety of characters that pass through their lives in their professions. Story lines span the gamut of birth through old age and death.

The view into their professional lives and how they treat others and how that effects their personalities, stresses and their relationship is also realistic and moving.  I am a Family Physician-I have delivered babies and I have worked at a hospice.  ""William and Mary""  does a good job weaving these settings into the story.
