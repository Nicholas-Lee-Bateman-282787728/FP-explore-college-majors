8103458,5,B000E0OLB0,"Have you ever just wanted to hang out for the day with some of your intellectual and artistic heroes? Well, unless you have the muscle to get James Hillman, Michael Ventura, and John Densmore into your autoMObile, then you will have to settle for cruising in Kevan Jenson's cinematic vehicle to spend quality time with these three numinous fellows. To say ""settle"" is not quite the right word, because every passage of this rather improvisational journey is filled with spontaneous utterings that are wise, humorous, and foreboding. This is one mighty cerebral drive-by for the Jungian and Archetypal Psychology crowds, but I think that any artistic and thinking person would find it provocative and stimulating.

Director (and visual artist) Jenson made a great stylistic choice in keeping this one loose, intimate,and on-the-fly, rather than have it be staged and considered: we simply cram into the jumper seat as this heady crew visits various locations around LA and just starts riffing--and any riffing these guys do is worth its weight in prima materia! The only problem I had with the film was that there wasn't more of it!  Where are the out-takes? (Though, in a way, the whole film is like one giant, beautiful out-take!). Where is the next wave, i.e., Surfing LA 2.0? Just load up the buggy with 2 or 3 other luminaries and paddle out for some more intellectual hang-ten!

I won't drop any quotes or tour-summaries to whet your appetite--if you know these guys you are already more than halfway to ordering this unique, fascinating dream-journal-on-wheels. You will want to see it several times to take it all in and savor every bon mot that issues forth. It's deep and it's fun. Catch the wave!",1263859200,4,1706,4.916666666666667
8103459,5,B000E0OLB0,"In this film Hillman takes depth psychology outside and visits various spots in the City of Angels. His conversations with writer Michael Ventura and musician John Densmore range from where LA keeps its memory (in a ditch) to the impact of mass media on the American psyche to the need to memorialize and remember tragic events like the LA riots. I show this film in my graduate classes as an example of terrapsychology, the deep study of how we interact with place. The scene at the LA Jail (""That is a paranoid building"") is particularly poignant, with Ventura's emotional reaction balancing out Hillman's more analytical one. Some of the freshness of the film comes from the fact that Kevan Jenson filmed it in a day.",1213315200,5,720,4.768
