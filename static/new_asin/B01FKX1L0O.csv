7750609,5,B01FKX1L0O,I love spin city! It was hard to find and the price was great! Great show to watch for some laughs!,1487376000,2,99,3.761904761904762
7750610,5,B01FKX1L0O,"Originally rated one star, was wrong this was user error. Company was very responsive, I just did not realize more than three episodes on each dvd.
Again user error.",1477353600,,165,4.724137931034483
7750611,5,B01FKX1L0O,I loved this show while it was on tv and then the reruns.  Just couldn't watch every episode every week so missed out on some of the story between episodes.  Love Michael J. Fox and with this being his last role in a television series before his medical condition made it to difficult to  continue acting.  Will always love his movies and television shows.  The rest of the cast is awesome as well but can't remember all their names.,1474588800,2,433,4.430379746835443
7750612,5,B01FKX1L0O,"Absolute 10/10. Every episode in order. Standard definition but this isn't a blu Ray release, so you get what you get. Hilarious show that soldiered on after the gallant Michael J. Fox exited for health reasons. Very fun, and kind of charming to watch in SD, as when it started that was the only option!",1473638400,7,303,4.527272727272727
7750613,5,B01FKX1L0O,Hard to find series that has great humor covering issues that are still relevant today.,1472428800,2,87,4.866666666666666
7750614,5,B01FKX1L0O,I've always loved this show and since it's no longer in syndication I thought I would purchase it.  I've seen just about every episode more than once and they're funny every time.,1465171200,,179,4.59375
7750615,5,B01FKX1L0O,"So far, so good.

I was skeptical of buying this set when I saw it was FINALLY available as a complete series. I was not sure if this was an authentic copy of the entire series, or if it was a knock-off (which Amazon has sold in the past, as I received a poor re-production of a season of Rules of Engagement). So far, the discs play, the quality is good, and the episodes appear to be in correct order. If I come across anything that seems unusual I will get back on here and let you know. As of now though, I'd have to say one of Michael J. Fox's best works is finally available in a complete series format. Enjoy!",1464652800,8,616,4.049180327868853
7750616,5,B01FKX1L0O,"This item lists as All Region. Well, now I am sure it plays Region 1. Fantastic! I love this show and was waiting to purchase it in a complete set. Here it is, everything you will find on the Shout Factory versions (some of which are out of print). The seller replied to my email immediately, by the way. I cannot stress enough that if you want the complete Spin City, this is currently the only way to get it...so get it!",1464220800,3,422,4.158536585365853
8761000,2,B01FKX1L0O,"The box is smushed and the plastic cases holding the DVDs are cracked. Was going to use as a gift but it looks bad. For the price, I would've expected better care/packaging. Will make sure every DVD works and will update my review.",1535328000,,231,4.395348837209302
