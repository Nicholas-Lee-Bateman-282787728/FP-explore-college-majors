1762431,5,B00006I03S,"Mclintock is plain John Wayne fun from beginning to end. It's been years since I've seen the old John Wayne films, and this is one of the classics, he and Maureen O'Hara make a great team and this film gives them both the opportunity to do what they do best, act. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, which was a pleasant surprise since so many older films I enjoyed years ago are just not as fun when I see them now. This one was every bit as fun today as it was years ago.",1162080000,5,468,4.043010752688172
1762432,5,B00006I03S,Reading other reviews on this and wanted to let you know the reasoning for the bad quality of the DVD.  This is not the authorized version of the movie.  The authorized version released by Batjac (Wayne's production company) will have an orange cover.  The blue cover is not authorized.,1093392000,,286,4.795918367346939
1762433,5,B00006I03S,"I am glad I came here to read the reviews. I thought my DVD of ""McLintock"" was bad or my eyes were worse than I thought. Terribe quality. This moive really needs to be in a wide-screen format and cleaned up. Other than that this is one of John Waynes best movies.",1081987200,3,263,4.076923076923077
1762434,3,B00006I03S,"Delta/LaserLight has also put out McLintock on DVD and it appears to use the same source GoodTimes used for their VHS and DVD, in other words, do not buy this DVD either.  Too bad as this is a great movie.  I will keep it until the John Wayne estate puts out an authorized DVD of it though.  I have averaged it to 3 stars because of the great movie but lousy DVD.",1060732800,,363,4.013888888888889

1762477,1,B00006I03S,Very poor picture quality and color and it look like it was a copy off of the VHS cause it was very scratchy looking and the sound was muffled in areas so that's why am returning it,1476144000,2,181,3.918918918918919
1762478,5,B00006I03S,"I bought this DVD for my mom to replace her VHS copy but here's my take.  McLintock Starring John Wayne,Maurine O'Hara &  Patrick Wayne among many other great stars is one of my top ten all time favorite John Wayne movies he ever made!  Take a western and dash it with a generous amount of comedy and you have MccLintock!.",1475884800,,322,4.333333333333333

1762497,3,B00006I03S,"I have this on a VCR cassette. It has always been one of my favorite John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movies. However, it was from the Walmart $4.00 bin a number of years ago and the quality wasn't there. Very grainy. So, I ordered this DVD thinking that the quality would be vastly improved because...well, it's a DVD. Wrong!! There is virtually no difference between the two. Perhaps they were put out by the same company, who knows, but there was zero special enhancement done to the DVD. So, I now have two copies of one of my favorites. Maybe some day I'll get a Blu-Ray, but by then no one except us old-timers will remember who John Wayne was.",1408233600,3,643,4.4576271186440675
1762498,5,B00006I03S,Love the movie and the price that Amazon offered it for. Thanks Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1404777600,,83,5.461538461538462
1762499,3,B00006I03S,"My review has nothing to do with the film itself which is very enjoyable. I am sure DUKE would not have been proud to know that some companies used cheap prints like this for dvd release. This film is well known to any JOHN WAYNE fans and includes two classic scenes who are often showed in documentaries on DUKE.The first one is the funny brawl in the mud and the other is the spanking of MAUREEN O'HARA at the end. If you want to hurt a feminist in your family,be sure that they watch it until the end. Like in THE QUIET MAN ten years earlier,MAUREEN O'HARA and WAYNE work well together. Everyone will recognize STEFANIE POWERS(a future tv star) as WAYNE's daughter. So you can buy it,but just forget that cheap edition and find a better one.",1404432000,,744,4.398550724637682
1762500,2,B00006I03S,the remake was bad,1404259200,,18,3.75
1762501,2,B00006I03S,When we watched the DVD it actually had vertical lines as though it had been copied from a worn out film. The colors were so washed out people standing next to each other blurred together.,1398470400,,188,4.4
1762502,1,B00006I03S,"Not the movie--the people who sold this blurry piece of junk. DO NOT BUY the dvd put out by Delta, which is this version, or the dvd put out by GoodTimes DVD. Both look like they were recorded off of someone's TV late at night. BUY THE PARAMOUNT VERSION and spend the same amount of money for way more quality in image and sound.",1396224000,7,329,4.15625
1762503,5,B00006I03S,"THIS WAS A MOST HILARIOUS VERSION OF MCLINTOCK WHICH WAS MUCH FUNNIER THAN THE EARLY VERSION.THE EARLIER VERSION SHOWS THE SPANKING AT A DISTANCE WHILE THE 2003 IS UP CLOSE.
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH FOR A LAUGH THESE DAYS. JOHN WAYNE, AS ALWAYS, THE PERFECT MAN WITH A SHOT GUN, OR SENSE OF HUMOR.",1390348800,,293,4.444444444444445

1762524,5,B00006I03S,"I can't say for sure, because I never met either of the stars - but if John Wayne and Maureen O'hara didn't have an absolute ball making this, I would be VERY surprised! This is simply a load of fun from one end to the other. Enjoy!",1360540800,,232,3.9574468085106385
1762525,2,B00006I03S,Always loved the movie but this recording was cheaply dubbed from a bad vhs tape. There are different versions to buy so save your money and your eyes.,1343001600,,151,4.428571428571429
1762526,1,B00006I03S,The Delta Entertainment DVD is clearly a pirated product and one of the worst film-to-DVD transfers I've ever seen.  At 50 cents a dozen this DVD would still be a waste of money.  Go with the Wayne Estate authorized version.,1335225600,,224,4.575
1762527,5,B00006I03S,"I Love This Movie McLintock! With ""The Duke"" As G.W. McLintock set in the town named after him,it's more comical than the usual Wayne Movies but it is worth it,I love His Defense of Native Americans(Indians) and I also love how he gives it to Maureen O'Hara(Very Beautiful) and Yvonne DeCarlo is just as beautiful. The Fight Sequences and the usual Non-PC-ness(in this modern day standards sadly)with A Chinaman as in every other film almost(Anyone notice John Wayne has the same guys in some Movies?)But My Favorite Line is""Government Ain't never gave anything to Anyone"".I Love it.",1324857600,,583,5.020618556701031
1762528,1,B00006I03S,"I purchased McLintock on dvd from this company about a month ago. The dvd came relatively fast, however, before I even opened the package I could hear pieces rattling around. The dvd case was broken and the dvd itself was scratched from the pieces and was floating around in the case. I called the company twice and left messages, neither were returned. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. I was very disappointed.",1284940800,,423,4.808219178082192
1762529,1,B00006I03S,"The video looks like a very very bad transfer from video tape to DVD. This is not the version of this movie you want to buy, ever. It's not worth $1 even.",1283644800,5,154,3.84375
1762530,5,B00006I03S,"this is a great product. Movie quality was excellent, as well as can be with an old movie. And I received my order within just a few days!!",1257120000,,139,4.0
1762531,1,B00006I03S,The Good Times version of McLintock was of atrocious quality. It ruined the entire experience. THis version should not be sold unless there is a disclaimer of the poor quality.,1252022400,,176,4.9
