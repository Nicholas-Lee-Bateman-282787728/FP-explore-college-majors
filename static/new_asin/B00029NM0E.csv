2072071,4,B00029NM0E,"Red Shadow tells the story of three ninja who grew up together (2 guys and 1 girl, obviously both guys are in love with the girl....) and face several risky missions together. In one of these, the girl gets killed, leaving both guys in despair. Anyway the two old friends will still get enough strenght to fight together once again for the final battle.
This is a nice movie with some fine special effects and a few lyrical moments in between the fighting scenes. The latter are not bad but are mostly of the ""wire-jutsu"" kind, so if you don't pay too much attentiions to impossible jumps and kicks (and also to dressing: I don't believe XVI century female ninjas wore leather mini-skirts!), you'll surely enjoy it.",1087862400,,715,4.637795275590551
2072092,1,B00029NM0E,"Just like the title... This is not the Red Shadow I used to know. Red Shadow is one of the famous Mangas back in 60's or earlier 70's, and was shoot in live-action TV series decades ago. Back in the 80's it was re-done into a whole new animation series which is what I grow up with, and the animation was a big-hit back then. Many toys, products were licensed under the animation line. I personally would say that the animation version of Red-Shadow was the best one. And I hope that they could make a compele series of Red Shadow Animation Series DVD.

In addition, the original manga is called ""Masked Ninja: Red Shadow"", and in the orignal story there are Red-Shadow (a school Teacher before he put mask on), Blue Shadow (a kid ninja who is smart), and White Shadow (a monk type of ninja who is older than Red Shadow and is his assistant). The original series has more like Batman/Spiderman/Superhero type of storyline, Red Shadow has two identities, and the other two ninjas are his sidekicks. Red Shadow even has a secret place where a man makes special weapons for them (Just like Q in James Bond). Kinda miss it.",1114473600,6,1119,4.485294117647059
2072093,3,B00029NM0E,"Two things I immediately noticed:  1) Ancient Japan didn't have toenail clippers, 2) Nor did they have aerosol spray bottles... both of which were shown in the film.  This cheapens it for me.  While the action scenes were good, the acrobat scenes were highly unbelievable, and the part where Akakage disappeared in thin air were a bit over the top.  That and the part where the master was creating fireworks from his fingertip.  It was all done in a serious manner.  If this was supposed to be a spoof movie it missed its mark big time.  Maybe only a Japanese sense of humor would get it.  I don't know.  I did moderately enjoy the movie, despite the obvious cheesiness.",1113868800,4,670,4.563025210084033
2072094,4,B00029NM0E,"This is a great movie.  It is intended as a light hearted adventure.  A younger generation's not so heavy journey through friendship.  Maybe some people don't care about such things, but I do :).

It's hip ninja action with 2 male leads who try to do just that in that silly way that makes this a joy to watch.  Personal issues arrise and we are witness to how 3 young friends interact with each other.  In the end they come out showing what friendship is all about.

How can you not like the Ninja Perfect Landing? ;)",1104278400,4,518,4.278350515463917
2072095,1,B00029NM0E,"There is no special effect in this movie. It is acted exactly like a play on stage. When a person was killed by a sword, only his face was shown. There was no blood. The kung fu fighting is like kids' games. It's looks like a comedy but it's not funny at all. The women ninjas wear scanty clothings. One was shown wearing stockings with patterns made in the 21 century!
After watching it for 20 minutes, I returned it to the movie store. It is not worth finishing it.",1097971200,,467,4.2
2072096,5,B00029NM0E,"This movie is one of the best out there today, it is a parady of past ninja movies, one that is not to be taken to seriously. If you want a serious film this is not the one for you. The commecal elements are hilarious, with tons physical humor. By the end of this movie my stomach hurt from laughing so hard. I would recommend this to anyone.",1097712000,3,342,4.044117647058823
2072097,4,B00029NM0E,"The story centers around a triangle of Ninjas who have grown up and trained with eachother all their lives. If you are not familiar with  Nakano's work then this movie will come as a shock for it is not your classic samurai movie. Instead Nakano breaks away from rigid tradition and does something different for a modern century. Though i will always enjoy classic japanese cinema, its great to see a young director do something new. Red Shadow features great cinematography, entertaining characters, and an intimate storyline. This one should definitely have a place on your shelf.",1095984000,3,582,5.0
2072098,1,B00029NM0E,"This movie was awful do not recommend buying this renting this or even looking at the cover. I hated every momment of this film. It is not funny, has a terrible soundtrack an is poorly acted. The story had potential three ninjas in a love triangle. But the sillyness of the whole film makes you not care at all about the characters. The main characters are more like the 3 stooges than 3 ninjas. The fighting was silly and weak. I liked the fighting in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie better. Overall if it were possible I would give this film negative stars",1095552000,5,565,4.4423076923076925
2072099,4,B00029NM0E,"I was left wondering why, but the movie is still good. Hey its not like I was wanting to watch a movie with a deep plot anyway. Watch it I do not think you will regret it.",1094601600,,171,3.6486486486486487
2072100,4,B00029NM0E,"Hiroyuki Nakano first burst onto my radar with his brilliant Samurai film, ""Samurai Fiction"". With that film he attempted to give a shot of energy and originality to the genre, and the result was one of the best Samurai films in years.

It was only natural for Nakano to move on to another popular genre of Japanese film, and when I discovered that Nakano the great had decided to make a Ninja film, I was elated! Ninjas are perhaps the coolest aspect of the jidai-geki world, and also one of the most underutalized. I hoped for great humor, impressive action, and characters to remember.

And Red Shadow kind of delivers. First, it's very entertaining. If you enjoyed Samurai Fiction, then you should have a blast watching Red Shadow. But at the end of the film (and throughout it at various points) I just felt that a little something was missing. I still can't quite put my finger on it.

Stylistically, Red Shadow is at least on par with SF. The cinematography is beautiful (and in glorious color this time), and Nakano gives us some extremely cool crane shots. The humor is there, as is the respectively tongue-in-cheek tone, but Red Shadow takes a slight turn for the melodramatic in the middle, and I think that might be where it stumbles.

I won't go into details, as it would kind of spoil an important bit of the film, but the fun, light-hearted film that makes you feel as if you could jump, flip, and spin through the air suddenly stops and takes a more dramatic tone. It's a brief break, though, and a necessary one to set up the characters for the second half. The problem here is that the film becomes  segmentmented into two parts that could very nearly be treated as seperate films. New characters come in, and while it doesn't take long to get to know them or see their importance to the continuing story, I couldn't shake the feeling that Red Shadow felt like two episodes of a film series.

Still, it's not that big of a flaw. There are other problems here: a slightly anti-climactic ending, a couple of plot holes, but nothing that really takes that much away from the film.

The characters aren't quite as interesting or charismatic as those in Samurai Fiction; that stops the film from being much more than entertainment.

This review has been pretty negative in tone, but it's really just from the high standard Nakano had set for himself. From another director, Red Shadow would be a great achievement. It's extremely stylish; the techno-rock soundtrack is very cool and somehow works well in context; the costumes look incredible; the special effects are subtle and convincing; the stunts and acrobatic feats a really awe-inspiring; the comedy suceeds almost without fail. It's certainly worth a look, and if you're prepared for the quirky comedy/romance/action tone, you should really enjoy Red Shadow.

The DVD: Media Blasters has done a spectacular job here. The transfer is beautiful, at least on par with any major studio release, and by far MB's strongest to date. I've yet to listen to the audio commentary, but the extras on the second disc are very interesting. There are mini-featurettes for some of the characters as well as a feature-length making of documentary that includes deleted scenes, interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and more. I especially enjoyed watching footage of how certain stunts were done (I was amazed and how little wires were used in this film! Most of the acrobatics are done by stunt men actually in the air doing AMAZING things with their body). It's a great DVD.

Recommended, but don't expect a brilliant or completely solid film. It's a very enjoyable light piece of Ninja entertainment.",1093219200,10,3657,4.808917197452229

8024639,4,B00029NM0E,"I thought this would be a serious story about Ninjas, but it's a comedy. A clan of ninja are the first to find a meteor that consists of a rare metal which they use to forge their weapons. These weapons are stronger than usual, so they are sought after by other warriors. The Ninja have to protect their clan and enemies who are corrupting their land. It's a cool B-C movie for anyone who likes ninja action.",1449878400,,408,4.311688311688312

Granted, Toho also produced a slew of all those huge monster flicks, starting off with Godzilla in 1954. Many silly, but never inept.",1331251200,,299,5.25

8024643,2,B00029NM0E,"I would guess that most people here don't know that Red Shadow (Akakage), Blue Shadow (Aokage) and White Shadow (Shirokage) were originally the main characters in a 1960s television series, Kamen no Ninja Akakage (Red Shadow: The Masked Ninja]. This film was a disapointment to me because I was expecing a movie version of the TV series, not a film in which three characters are given names from a TV series then portrayed as nothing like their namesakes. For those who don't know Red Shadow in the TV series wore a red mask which gave him special powers. White Shadow was an older ninja who acted as Red Shadow's sidekick not his superior. And Blue Shadow was a young boy who liked to play with explosives. Except for Blue Shadow the original actors are deceased. There was no female ninja in the series and thus no love triangle. There were four different evil groups in the TV series, each trying to wipe out all the samurai and ninja clans so they could rule Japan. The live action TV series was remade as an animated series in 1987. Why it was neccesary to jettison everything that made the TV series what it was I don't understand. I guess Japanese film makers like American think its a good idea to take a TV series that was not a comedy and attempt to make a comedy film out of it. It isn't a good idea but they keep trying it.",1202083200,,1335,4.4089068825910935
8024644,2,B00029NM0E,"I did not find Hiroyuki Nakano's film ""Red Shadow,"" all that appealing. I like parody in films, and while I believe his earlier film, ""Samurai Fiction,"" is great, this film I found to be just silly, dull and boring. The cinematography in the film is great, and some may like this film, however, I found the film too childish. What comedy there is in the film felt like it did not belong there, with the slapstick style that just made the film seem a little too childish. When I purchased the film, I could not sit through the first half-hour. I had to watch it three times before I FINALLY watched it in its entirety. Don't get me wrong on this, I think parody and satire are great--especially if they are done right. Two Samurai films that come to mind are Nakano's ""Samurai Fiction"" and the film ""Kill.""

At first I thought that maybe I was just expecting too much after seeing ""Samurai Fiction."" But, I don't think so. While 'SF' pulled me right in, this film pushed me away. I found the film very difficult to watch, which is a telling sign that there is something wrong about it. That is not to say that others will not like the film. Now, the film is not your typical ninja flick--and I knew this when purchasing the film. I knew that this was supposed to be a farcical ninja film that did not take itself too seriously. But the ninja fight scenes were just too silly for me. Also, the films narrative is disjointed. The main problem for me was that the story and characters were just not that interesting.

The films narrative is basically about three assassins who go off to fight for their leader White Shadow, against other ninja clans. I liked the character Asuka (Kumiko Aso) who is one of the trained ninjas. They have all been childhood friends. When one of the ninja friends dies, the other two split up to avenge her death. I really liked the two AZUMI films [more serious in nature of course], but there was something lacking in this film that was a real turn off. It comes off as a little too campy for one. And as I wrote earlier, there is a lot of silliness to the film. As for the acting--forget it, it was bad. I know friends who really like this film, but for me, I found it tedious and boring. I do not recommend the film. If you must watch the film, rent it first. [Stars: 2.5]",1191110400,,2302,4.338747099767981
8024645,2,B00029NM0E,"This movie was not funny although it tried desperately,(perhaps thats why they didn't advertise it as a comedy).I got about 20 minutes through it and stopped. Only watched further along into because my kids saw it on the shelf(even they got bored with it).Although i saw it only 2 months ago..it is a vague memory. Do not buy this film unless u can get it real really cheap. Finding a respectable ninja/shinobi movie is harder than finding a good lasagne or shoes for that matter.

8024646,1,B00029NM0E,"Honestly, the only reason I even considered this movie was because of the very beautiful Masanobu Ando. And it starts out interesting enough... but quickly goes down. The story focuses around three ninjas, friends from childhood. When one of them dies the other two split up and set out to avenge her death. This movie is campy, but not in a good way. The stunts are cheesy, the music is BAD, and the acting leaves a lot to be desired. I was embarrassed to be watching this one.",1147305600,6,478,4.443181818181818
