8280914,5,B001B157CS,"I am an amateur. I bought my wife a good quality ""portable"" massage table here on Amazon last year for our anniversary, which caused raised eyebrows when she opened it.  A year later, I have taken ""introduction to massage therapy"" at a local LMT school twice, and I have purchased a variety of DVDs, a couple books, and downloaded an app which lets me study the human musculature and bone structure.  I barely used the books, and while the shiatsu style DVDS were pleasant, my wife likes deep tissue massages.

This DVD series, including pelvic girdle, shoulder girdle, extremities (legs/arms), feet, breast (should be called pectoral), and hands have very seriously been the difference in becoming able to (as an amateur) to give a massage and get positive feedback.  And at this point my wife is talking about just having me give her a massage every weekend and cutting down on how often she goes to her favorite local LMT (oops, sorry 'bout that).

I've watched each DVD through twice to be sure I was roughly familiar with how it would go.  Then I played the DVD while going through the massage a couple of times, so I could be sure I had positioning and pressure and process right.  It makes for a little awkward stop and go sometimes as you absorb another DVD, but the results have really paid off.  I don't know how an LMT would respond to these videos, but as someone who wants to be able to give good massages to spouse (and maybe a couple of good friends/relatives), I would recommend you start here rather than buy random DVDs.",1485820800,5,1538,4.587591240875913
8280915,5,B001B157CS,"This is excellent for clients with low back pain!!!

I've always known that usually, when a client of mine has low back pain, I should work in the glute/hip area. This dvd is simply expanding my knowledge and techniques so that I can do more with it, and really focus on where it's coming from. The pain is definitely usually radiating from the trochanter of the femur, where so many of the muscles are attaching. With the things I've learned, I have better techniques and ways of getting into it and working the muscles.

The pelvis was also a great place to learn about. It can be scary for many clients, so it's important to learn about the proper draping, communication, and techniques that go with it. I definitely have a few clients that feel pain in their pelvis when I work in other places on their body, so it'll work out well for them.

I purchased all 3 of Meade Steadman's Deep Tissue Massage videos and like all of them, I'd recommend getting them as a set.
I'd recommend it!",1444521600,3,988,4.447513812154696
