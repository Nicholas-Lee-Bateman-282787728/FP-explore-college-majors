The series are meant to be comparable to Jesus' parables.  While we watched, however, we couldn't really draw any decent similarities.  The stories themselves were a little bit random and didn't serve a whole lot of religious purpose, at least not in my kids' (or my) eyes.  This actually distressed my 8-year old, because she was trying really hard to understand the ""point"" and to take a lesson away from it.  They were very fun and silly videos though, and will possibly be watched again by my 4-year old boy.  I give this DVD 2 stars.

Review:

My review was mostly based on my 4 year old daughter's reaction to the three short movies on the dvd.  The first movie, Swuid Sushi Loses His Marbles, actually teaches our children that there are bigger things in life than items you may have at home, treasurers to one may not be that to others.  The second show, Wally the Waiter is about someone being deceitful and the third, The Flaming Monkey is about people coming together.  The movie is very short, though it kept my daughter entertaining and she actually wanted to watch it again, so for that, it was worth watching.

I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",1296432000,,1717,4.760135135135135

I requested ""Adventures in BoogaBooga Land: Squid Sushi Loses his Marbles"" with the hopes that I would receive a quality cartoon that would teach parables that my daughter would be able to enjoy for several years to come.  Unfortunately, the DVD did not live up to its advertised ""clear, challenging and engaging"" parable ""remakes"".

First of all, the animation itself (even though it's for kids) is beyond cheesy, with banana swipes for scene changes, and jumpy transitions for character movements.  The script is lacking in significant plot development, and the characters are annoying and slightly reminiscent of the yellow sponge (who shall remain nameless) who's not allowed to be watched in our house because of his rudeness.

How the writer/producer/director can reconcile a series that's supposed to be about the parables of Jesus with a main character who is consistently rude and irresponsible is a mystery to me.  I'm not even sure I'll pass this DVD along as a ""giveaway"" for our children's ministry.

Rated 3 Stars

When I seen this DVD  to be reviewed I jumped at the chance. With working the  Nursery and Toddlers at Church I felt this  would be good for them as they love to watch the Veggie Tales. Based on the  parables of Jesus,  I was a little disappointed in this for a couple of reason.

There are three short  movies on the DVD- ""Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles""  based on Matthew 13: 45-46 - The parable of the hidden treasure and the pearl. ""Wally The Waiter "" based on Matthew 13:24-30-The parable of the weeds  and  ""The Flaming Monkey"" based on Matthew 22:2-14- The parable of the wedding banquet

Before  watching each episode I read the scriptures that  pertained to the specific movie and I could understand where and how it related but I understand that these are made for children and I do not think that a younger child will get the meaning behind the cartoon. I feel that the younger children  will enjoy them as each one is short so there attention can be held, but explaining the parable to them needs to be done in such a way  they will understand the concept of what the cartoon was about.  When  a child is old enough to  understand what the parables mean then I feel the cartoons may be a little childish  for them.
I also did not hear anything mentioned about Jesus in any of the three episodes and I feel if they are doing a Christian DVD then they should at least mention Jesus  and the scripture verses mentioned somewhere along the line. The idea is great, there just needs to be a little bit more Christian substance  to them in my opinion.

I received this book free from the publisher through the  Book Sneeze bloggers review program. A positive review was not required and the opinions expressed here are my own thoughts  on the product.",1296345600,,1912,4.469565217391304

I was happy to review this DVD as I love watching cartoons. These stories are based on the parables of Jesus. There are 3 episodes included on this DVD!

Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles (The Lost Pearl - Matthew 13:45-46) Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffe are on an adventure to recover lost treasure.

Wally the Waiter (The Soil and the Seeds - Matthew 13:24-30) Marty and Gerard needed to save the day when the chocolate cake recipe was stolen by a thief.

The final episode, The Flaming Monkey (The Wedding Banquet - Matthew 22:2-14) Marty and Gerard have to find guests for a banquet when all of the invited guests didn't show up.

As a grown up who like watching cartoons didn't find this cartoon that interesting but a child may.

3690774,3,B001LQQJ1Q,"Recently my son and I got to watch The Adventures of Booga Booga Land by Richard Milner, this movie was so touching to us. The beginning of it skipped a little but once it got going my son did not move from the television and was so intrigued by it. I am so glad that booksneeze.com was able to send us a copy of this movie. Marty the Monkey was our favorite character, but we enjoyed all of the characters in the movie. I enjoyed watching my son learn about Jesus and how he repeated after the characters, especially Marty and Mr. Squid Squishi; along their journey of 10,000 different jobs, journeys and lessons all made from biblical parables that Jesus taught many years ago. I let my son save a chocolate muffin so he would feel like he got to help them save the chocolate cake. It is hard for me to find cartoons for my son to watch as nothing compares to the famous Veggie Tales; however he did enjoy these at the age of two and I hope that he will be able to understand them better when he gets older and to be able to help teach other children about Jesus. Each part is about 10 minutes long and perfect enough to show one clip at a time and then talk about it to older children and explain to them more on where the cartoons are coming from and make sure they understand it fully.",1296172800,,1290,4.184738955823293
3690775,2,B001LQQJ1Q,"The dvd entitled Adventures in BoogaBooga Land: Squid Sushi Loses His Marble is a children's dvd that teaches three parables.  The dvd contains three episodes, one for each of the parables and each episode is about 15 minutes in length.  The three parables that it portrays are: the lost pearl (Matthew 13:45-46), the soil and the seeds (Matthew 13:24-30), and the wedding banquet (Matthew 22:2-14).  Although I was looking for a great new Christian dvd for my daughter this one was a bit of a disappointment to me.  I was expecting to see a show that was different than most other cartoons because it was based on the Bible.  The only way that I could tell that it was a Christian dvd was the fact that it told the Bible verse that the parable came from before each of the segments began.

The first parable portrayed on the dvd was the parable of the lost pearl.  I did not feel that it had a very good story line and that it didn't relate anything to the kingdom of heaven or even hint at it.  The second parable portrayed was the soil and the seed and had nothing to do with the parable at all.  The third parable portrayed was the wedding banquet and by far, out of the three, this one made the most sense and had a good enough cartoon storyline to go along with it.

The characters of this series are just average but lack a bit of energy.  The Christian values don't seem to be represented much in these movies because there are a lot of characters getting hurt (splatted, sling-shotted, catapulted, etc.) with no apologies or asking if they are alright.  I wouldn't really recommend this dvd to anyone with the vision of helping their child learn about the Bible stories but if you would like just a typical cartoon then this dvd would be fine for that.

I asked what he would do to make it better and he suggested Tony Hawk.  He did laugh a few times, such as when the monkey was on fire or when the squid was stuck to the monkey's face.  I also let the movie keep running after the first time through and he did continue to watch it.  But I don't believe that this will be one of his favorites.  I do happen to know the third parable that the dvd was based on and it is a good idea in theory.  I just don't think that it did enough to relate to the Bible.  If there had been a better explanation of the Bible verses, it might have been better.  I think it seemed more like 3 random cartoons put together.",1296172800,,761,3.915032679738562

Adventures in Booga Booga Land is a children's DVD series with short ""episodes"" based on different parables.  Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffe are humorous kids characters that help tell the stories.

This video is more so in the mediocre form.  It was a decent attempt to share parables from the Bible however I know there are much better videos out available for better usage in a Childrens Ministry department.

8319528,3,B001LQQJ1Q,"Adventures in Booga Booga Land: Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles, The Parable of the Lost Pearl, and Other Stories is a cartoon retelling of some of the parables of Jesus from the Gospel of Matthew.

I have mixed feelings about this DVD. The cartoons adequately ""re-told"" the parables through the escapades of Gerard the Giraffe and Marty the Monkey, but I wish they had more fully explained how they relate to the parables themselves. I feel like a family discussion should follow each cartoon clip so that the kids understand how the cartoon relates to the parable.

I appreciated the ""feel"" of the cartoon characters. There was a classic feel to this DVD. The characters and situations, as well as the bumbling attempts by certain authority figures, reminded me of cartoons I grew up watching. At the same time, I'm not sure I want my children to see authorities as foolish and inept. (I realize they're as human as the rest of us, but I'm trying to teach the kids to respect those God has placed in leadership positions.)

I thought the cartoons were rather humorless, with the exception of a couple of scenes in ""The Flaming Monkey"" (the last episode), but the girls laugh often during the DVD and frequently ask to watch it.

I give this DVD 3 stars, but I think my kids would give it at least 4. Overall, I was disappointed.

8319529,2,B001LQQJ1Q,"Booga Booga Land is a silly video which name and concept caught my attention right away.  It's a DVD series which is supposed to follow the same plots as parables from the Bible.  This particular DVD is broken into three episodes which follow the parables of the lost pearl (Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles), the soil and the seeds (Wally the Waiter), and the wedding banquet (The Flaming Monkey).  The main characters are silly animals including Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffe.

I couldn't help but think of Sponge Bob Square Pants while watching the video with my kids.  Same sort of funny humor and pace of story.  But with a Christian twist, loosely.  Unfortunately, I couldn't grasp the message of the three episodes even when looking for it.  For kids, I think it would be extremely hard to learn anything from these stories.  It was a stretch, unlike Hermie and Friends, Veggie Tales, or Gigi videos.  As an adult, I love the idea of using parables and changing them to teach the same lesson but in a different way.  But this video series just didn't do that as I had expected.  But I must say, my kids did enjoy them for the silly humor, fun characters, and humorous events.

Marty is always getting into scrapes. If something bad is going to happen it will be when Marty is around. Marty does not mean to get into mischief, but it happens just the same.

The DVD follows Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe in their adventures in a place called Booga Booga Land. Through their adventures Marty and Gerald learn lessons from the parables of Jesus.

The Parable they learn include the following: The Weeds - Matt 13:24-30, The Valuable Pearl - Matt 13:45-46, and The Wedding Banquet - Matt 22:2-14.

My son found them entertaining, and the lessons they teach children are very valuable. However, they are no Veggietales. They kind of reminded me of Spongebob Square Pants cartoons. The quirky character and the humor. My wife and I do not like Spongebob and we quickly got annoyed with it.

The bright colors and fun characters certainly held my kids' attention, but the storyline and connection to Biblical parallels was not very strong. I was also very bothered by the somewhat crass and violent humor that was on this ""Bible Story"" DVD. In it's defense, the bothersome humor was much milder than it's secular counterparts, however, it still isn't something I want in my home.

Even as an adult I had a very hard time correlating the on-screen stories to their Biblical counterparts. This cartoon is certainly not designed to teach your kids a Bible lesson, but maybe get them thinking in the right direction. In the end there's such a loose connection to scripture an explanation is needed to make any sense of it all.

This show is a definite pass, there are a lot more wholesome and Biblical options out there.

The DVD contains 3~15 minute cartoons that are supposedly based on parables of the Bible.

I have to say that I wasn't terribly impressed.  The animation wasn't spectacular and the script was a tad on the cheesy side.  But the biggest problem I had with this DVD was that the Biblical message wasn't really there.

My daughters, age two and ten, also watched the movie.  (Several times. LOL)  Afterward I asked my oldest about the movie.  Specifically if it made her think about God or the Bible at all.  Her answer was no.  She was really surprised when I told her they were based on some parables from the Bible.  And the Bible is something we study everyday for school.

So all-in-all, I'd say that dvd had some entertainment value for the kids but it certainly  didn't help establish any Biblical truths for them.  Maybe some sort of wrap-up, similar to what Veggie Tales does, could help cement what the author was trying to get across?

Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles, Wally the Waiter, and The Flaming Monkey

Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffee teach children valuable lessons in these cute, creative cartoons set in Boogabooga Land.  In approximately 45 minutes there are three short animated adventures.  I think these are great short clips that will keep kid's attention, although I don't see them being favorites that are watched over and over again.

The messages or underlying take home truth that the authors are trying to get across may be difficult for children?  It is much easier for children to get the point of a show or book if the message is clearly stated.  I don't have children yet and am 26 so I could be very wrong!  Jesus or God is not specifically named, and neither is heaven or hell or other Biblical concepts, for better or worse.

Also, the script is a bit cheesy (as maybe it was designed to be).  These are not professionally made cartoons, but they are a good option for churches or Sunday Schools (they would be great with discussion questions digging deeper into the messages!).
