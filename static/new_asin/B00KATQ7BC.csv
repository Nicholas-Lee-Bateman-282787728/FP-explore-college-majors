8657010,3,B00KATQ7BC,"Sam Blake (Martin Kemp) is an MI 6 assassin. He wakes up to a phone call ordering him to kill 6 people in 6 hours or else his daughter (Carla Cresswell) will die. Sam recently had a botched trip to Spain where he was ordered to kill a man who turned out not to be the target. Also there is a bad subplot of immigration phobia in ""Londonistan.""

How many of these films are they going to make? A man must do something for a stranger on the other end of the phone or else. I just saw ""7 Cases"" and this type of film is getting old. Apparently every studio feels obligated to make one or else. This film was low budget. Anouska Mond as the investigator was interesting as she was able to get to every crime scenes within minutes, assess the situation, question witnesses and have enough time to make it back to Scotland Yard, and do more investigating before the next killing an hour later.

Martin Kemp wasn't really exciting, so they added Lucy Pindar to the script. 3 soft stars.
