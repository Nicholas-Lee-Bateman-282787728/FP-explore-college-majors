3441595,5,B0019M7024,"I highly recommend this DVD set to any hypnotist wanting to learn or improve upon their instant& rapid inductions. This is the best product that I have found on the subject. You will learn how and why these inductions work, and when they are most appropriate to use. Techniques are explained in detail with easy to understand instructions. You will be able to confidently begin practicing these inductions after your first viewing. There is useful information here for both novice and experienced hypnotists.",1220572800,2,508,5.132530120481928
3441596,5,B0019M7024,"Sean Michael Andrews is widely acknowledged as the `World's Fastest Hypnotist.' He has trained hundreds of hypnotists worldwide in his spectacular methods of instant induction. This two DVD training set is a film of one of his instant induction seminars.

The DVDs begin with some demonstrations of instant and `super rapid' inductions, just to show you what you will be capable of after watching the DVDs. The demonstrations are particularly useful simply because they aren't just done on friends and loyal students in a seminar room, but with real unconditioned people out on the street.

Before Sean goes into the specific Instant Induction techniques he begins with a little ""focused relaxation"" a great little hypnotic induction (which, even via DVD, was very powerful!)aimed at allowing you to learn the techniques of instant and rapid inductions quickly and easily. Once your unconscious mind is on task, the techniques begin.

Rather than teach new methods, Sean focuses on the more traditional techniques, and teaches them very well. The first technique taught on the video set is the Elman induction. Starting with the stretched out three to four minute version Sean takes you through shortening the Elman induction until you can reliably do it in just a few seconds.
The three instant induction techniques taught on the DVDs are the armpull induction, the hand drop induction, and the handshake induction.

The hand drop induction is very well covered. First there is a discussion of the instant induction theory which thoroughly covers the academic side of instant inductions and is ideal for those who need things explained logically and scientifically.
Next you see a demonstration of the hand drop induction on a student at the seminar, and a discussion of the technique. Sean goes into great detail on the mechanics of the induction, exactly when to pull your hand away, when to say ""sleep!"", how to catch your subject and, of tremendous importance, deepeners.

Both verbal and kinaesthetic deepeners (head rotating etc) are very well covered. Sean is also very responsible and safety conscious, and teaches you how to ensure disaster doesn't strike.

After this the arm pull induction method is taught. With both the traditional version and the Gil Boyne version covered in great detail, with the theory and mechanics well explained, and great demonstrations on students.

After this you get to watch his students practice the techniques on each other. Its great to see them walking around knocking each other down in just a few seconds, after only a few hours of training.

Following this Sean talks about confusion inductions, and demonstrates a handshake induction on a very surprised and soon deeply entranced student. He talks about more sneaky surprise inductions, basically how to instantly hypnotize someone who is not expecting it.
This is a very fun section, in which Sean teaches things which most other teachers emphatically claim to be impossible.

On the whole the two DVD set is ideal for experienced hypnotists to refine their technique and expand their repertoire, and for beginners to learn all you need to in order have the confidence to use instant and rapid inductions out in the real world.
The only drawback is, like most hypnosis DVDs, the quality is not perfect (ie at one stage a rather rude student stands right in front of the camera as Sean demonstrates an induction) but the content easily makes up for this.

I found that the DVDs taught the techniques in a way which made the inductions surprisingly easy to learn and understand (or maybe I am just responding to Sean's hypnotic suggestions :D). I highly recommend these DVDs to anyone wishing to learn and master instant hypnotic inductions.

3441597,5,B0019M7024,Sean Michael Andrews Instant Induction DVD is a tool every hypnotist should have in their tool box. It's easy to understand and through in its explanation and demonstration.

8274679,4,B0019M7024,Sean Andrews is a really good teacher and shows great techniques for ''putting people under'' i really enjoyed it the only thing is that the sound quality is not too great and sometimes people were walking in front of the camera. otherwise i would recommend it to anyone who wants to get an understanding of hypnosis and inductions.,1299110400,,332,4.741379310344827
8274680,4,B0019M7024,"So I bought this a week ago and I've already gone through it. Here are the pros and cons:

Cons:
- Kind of expensive..
- Poor video quality
- He could of explained the instant inductions more, like the pretalk right before he places people into trance.
- This is NOT for beginners. You should read a book before buying this or you won't understand! You need a certain base. I got Geoffrey Ronning's stage hypnosis book and helped me well.

Pros:
- Everything you need to know is there!

I'm quite satisfied, really. I haven't been able to hypnotize anyone though (haven't tried.. yet!). Don't forget that this is a skill and not some trick! It requires practice!!",1282694400,,663,4.554621848739496
8274681,4,B0019M7024,"To the reviewer who complained about the video quality being cheap:
Full studio productions cost a lot more to produce.

As for the videos; that which is taught works well, and is up to date.
I am a professional hypnotist myself; this video training will be of some use to those who have a firm grasp of the principles of hypnosis. That translates to: Go take a hypnosis course for beginners if you don't know the first thing about it. Without understanding why this works, you will not be doing what Mr. Andrews does. Or at least, nowhere near so easily. (Don't be surprised if you crash and burn.)

Mr. Andrews is a trained hypnotist; see nononsensehypnosis dot com.
The most up to date training that I would wholeheartedly recommend, is that of the omni hypnosis center, in Deland, Florida. This is an endorsement. Go for the best and most up to date training. Save yourself the grief of wasting your hard earned cash on a myriad of films, books, or audio discs, which is what you will be doing if you do not first understand how and why this thing works. And I don't mean the ""cliff's notes"" version. Get real already.

I have seen so many seminars where guys supposedly learn how to hypnotize women, for example, and most all of those guys have never in their life even thought about simply GETTING actual TRAINING.

I gave this video 4 stars. It is worth your time; still, go for the training. I promise that you will get a heck of a lot more out of this DVD set then.",1280880000,,1474,4.428044280442805
8274682,4,B0019M7024,"The video could be better if Michael Andrews put somebody helping with the camera. However, the information of the video is very instructive and very well explained. Thank Michael Andrews for the video, and remember, next time put somebody helping with the camera.",1270857600,2,264,5.162790697674419
8274683,1,B0019M7024,Not worth the money. Video production looks very cheap and I know no more about hpnosis then I did before.,1265155200,2,106,4.35
8274684,5,B0019M7024,"First, the information in the videos is priceless.  Anywhere else you would pay much more for less information. I have purchased really bad ""allegedly"" powerful techniques sold out there that make me wonder that the only way I purchased them was because I was hypnotized.

Second, the DVD is literally a visual manual in order to achieve the techniques Mr. Andrews teaches. Third his talent in conveying the message is outstanding and motivating. Fourth, Customer Service, Mr. Andrews backs up his products 100%.  I called him because I had a question concerning one of the DVDs and he personally answered the call (he includes his card in the DVD case) and  addressed my concern immediately!  No questions asked or comments made. His actions were instrumental in my next decision regarding the possibility of taking his course. Since actions speak louder than words I decided to take his course.

Boy was I impressed!  If you can, TAKE HIS COURSE, you will never regret it.  As an instructor Mr. Andrews is motivating and inspiring.  He strives to make you feel part of his hypnosis family and is deeply concerned about your learning experience. Not like a lot of other schools/teachers that are just interested in making a quick buck or two.  The most wonderful part of his program is the ""outdoor experience.""  You will be pushed out of your comfort zone by practicing outside of the classroom with total strangers.  I promise after you break the ice you will want to repeat the experience every time you can. You will gain real life hands on experience.

As an individual Mr. Andrews is a very knowledgeable, humble and generous person.  He wants you to feel comfortable with him and he is open to sharing his vast database of experiences.  You literally feel like you are the only one in the classroom.

Without a doubt his videos and class will exceed all your expectations. One regret though, I did not enjoy the privilege of meeting him earlier.  Mr. Andrews may be considered the Worlds Fastest Hypnotist but he is also the World's Greatest Hypnosis Ambassador.",1244505600,2,2070,4.851851851851852

8274687,5,B0019M7024,"Sean Michael Andrews is an excellent teacher and presenter of this material. You can clearly see that he excells in these techniques,
but he also excells in explaining how to achieve the same results
and how to test for them. Whether you are a professional or a novice you will learn plenty in these DVDs. They are well worth the investment in time and money.
While the DVDs are not slickly produced, strictly a one camera shoot.
The quality of the material more than makes up for that and
it allows more of Sean Michael's personality and good nature to shine through.

I highly recommend it.
