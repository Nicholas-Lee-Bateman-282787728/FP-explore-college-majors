8219336,3,B000VLMT3Y,"... but who was? Cesti, Puccini, Bellini, Menotti, Capresi, Agnolotti? Nobody else has ever been Monteverdi! But Francesco Cavalli (1602-1676) was right there with the Master in time and place. La Didone was premiered in 1641, a year after Monteverdi's Ritorno di Ulisse in Patria and a year before L'Incoronazione di Poppea. And Cavalli was a central figure in the evolution of opera, easily the best known and most popular composer of such works in his age. He's credited with composing 41 operas, of which 27 are extant, more than of all the other operatistas of the first two-thirds of the 17th Century combined. Once you learn to listen to 'recitativo' as the ichor of melody, Cavalli's operas are of more than historical interest; they're full of affect and charm, sometimes witty, sometimes tragic, often bitingly satirical, plus the literary merits of many of his librettos -- La Didone especially -- make the words worth setting precisely in recitativo.

Yes, Cavalli's operas are certainly worth reviving and staging! However, I doubt that this DVD of La Didone (the familiar story of Aeneas's escape from Troy, his passionate love of Queen Dido, and then his flight from her as commanded by Jove) will convince many listeners/viewers of Cavalli's special merits. Visually, it's almost an embarrassment. There are no sets to complain about, but the costuming and cosmetics are utterly amateurish. I'm not a reviewer who dwells on costumes often, but these range from shabby to silly, from white bathrobes to aviator's goggles, raggedy makeshift suited for a high school pageant rather than for La Fenice in Venice, snatched from the laundry baskets in the sort of town where the school board obstructs the teaching of evolution. Likewise no effort is made to render the characters plausible; Ascanio for instance, Aeneas's son, is sung by middle-aged woman with zero boyish manner or appearance. Jove, Neptune, Juno, Mercury, and Aeolus are all laughably unmajestic. Scarcely any of the cast has 'stage presence' to spare, and the stage director seems to have done his/her worst to make them all stodgy. The exception is Magnus Staveland -- Aeneas -- who looks, moves, and sings as a hero should. If my rating of this opera were based on 'visuals' only, I'd give it one star.

At the other end of the Milky Way, there's the glorious instrumental performance by Europa Galante, with Fabio Biondi both conducting and fiddling. Cavalli had to be content with smaller orchestras than Monteverdi, and less varied continuo, but this score offers some delightfully picturesque timbres: reed organ, trombones with vibrating tongues, paired recorders, and vigorous hand percussion. Unfortunately for us, this opera is utterly dominated by singing. The instruments are for the most part merely punctuation. Five stars for the people in the pit, but ...

It's the singing that must be excellent, authentic in technique, and cohesive in ensemble .... all of which it is not. As I said before, Magnus Staveland sings impressively, with polished inflections emphasizing the eloquence of his voice. The other 'principal' role, Dido, is sung by Claron McFadden, whose voice has more power than beauty and whose ornamentation is uneven and stiff, though not as stiff as her stage presence. The most creditable vocal effort, both in technique and in affect, comes from Donatella Lombardi, who sings different characters in Troy and Carthage, Aeneas's wife Creusa first and then Dido's sister Anna. Much of my dissatisfaction with this vocal cast is that they don't all sing in the same musical language. Possibly that was Biondi's failure for not directing them more insistently, or possibly it was just a matter of inadequate rehearsal, but there's no sense of magical unity about what we hear.

For most living opera patrons, La Didone will be 'difficult to follow' even though, as I said, the Italian libretto by Giovanni Busanello is first rate. ""We"" simply don't know our Virgil very well any more, as everyone knew him in the 17th C. Thus, when Iarbas opens an act with an extended recitatation of his spurned love for Dido, most people today will wonder who the devil that queer figure could be. Besides, we moderns will miss half the fun, and all the point, of Busanello/Cavalli's surprise ending to the opera, their deliberate reversal of the traditional tragedy. But that's ""our"" problem, rather than a flaw in the libretto or the music. I could wish, nevertheless, that the marketers of this DVD, Dynamic, had at least provided an intelligible synopsis and a commentary of substance. They didn't.

Alas, another wasted opportunity ...",1316390400,7,4637,5.088042049934297
8219337,3,B000VLMT3Y,"The first copy I ordered of this DVD set never arrived at my address, in Sri Lanka. Without much further ado amazon.com sent me a replacement.... thank you amazon, it confirmed you are the best...

This DVD has a lot of things going for it. Its greatest strength is the excellent singing and acting, in the first place by Claron McFadden, who is a virtuoso Baroque singer (listen to all those decorations!) and a convincing Didone. But nearly all the other singers, most of them not known to me before, are excellent as well, with maybe Jordi Domenech (Iarba) as the other great star. Magnus Staveland as Enea is, I think, an exception. He neither acts nor looks the role, although his singing is acceptable. But then, Aeneas is an unrewarding role in most operas that deal with his easy betrayal of the woman he claims to love and leaves weeping crocodile tears. Conductor Bondi and Europa Galanta produce a wonderfully intimate and expressive sound, and make what they can of this score. Whenever Bondi himself picks up the violin it is a joy to pick out his virtuoso playing. The production is rather unimaginative and at times a bit amateurish (why is that spotlight roaming around in such an irritating fashion, and was there really no better inexpensive way of imitating waves than two people pulling Neptune's train up and down?), but at least it is mostly unobtrusive.

Unfortunately all these efforts are lavished on a mediocre work. It has nothing of the flexibility, variety and expressiveness of Monteverdi's operas, and the Dido-Aeneas situation has none of the poignancy of Purcell's work. In fact, I was surprised when it was over.... was that all?! Yes, definitely, some of the recitative is expressive, but it does not compare with Monteverdi, and the few tunes that come in between are mostly simple and unsurprising. For me this was therefore an opera worth seeing once, but not again, and unfortunately that goes for all Cavalli's works. He is often dubbed a ""worthy successor of Monteverdi"", but don't be misled.... Monteverdi's worthy successor is Mozart, with Purcell and Handel coming close.",1212019200,10,2115,4.905027932960894
8219338,4,B000VLMT3Y,"Didone is one of some thirty operas (mostly comic) written by Francesco Cavalli (nee' Caletti) for the Venetian stage. It was premiered in 1641 when the composer was 39 and represents the mature period of his works. Cavalli was the pupil of C. Monteverdi and a worthy successor but his works are not in the same league as Monteverdi's Poppea or the Return of Ulysses. In this opera he and his librettist Gian Francesco Busenello tell the story of the tragic destruction of Troy, departure of Aeneas to Carthage and then the desertion of it's Queen Dido by Aeneas as he goes to Italy. Though writing on a heroic-tragic section of the Aeneid, the composer and librettist avoid a sad ending distasteful to the public by having Dido marry a King Iarbas of the Getuli in the last passages of the opera. The first act unfolds as a series of flexible dramatic recitatives. These are often as variations on descending tetrachord ostinato. They are very effective and their beauty is truly remarkable. The strophic lament of Cassandra and her mother Hecuba over the ruins of Troy is very moving. To me the farewell of Aeneas and his now dead wife Creusa is the most heartrending section of the opera. Yes there are dry patches throughout the piece but most of the work is quite rewarding. As noted the recitatives are quite variable, sometimes with accompanying or independent parts for other instruments in addition to simple ostinato, Arias, ariosas and duets appear in the second and third acts. These usually involve Queen Dido. She now looms large as the pivotal character and shows a range of emotions from haughty in initially rejecting Iarbas, cautious on first meeting Aeneas, meltingly amorous toward Aeneas after being ""pricked"" by Eros to suicidally distraught but noble after Aeneas, at the behest of the gods, leaves her for Italy. The Dido role is superbly developed by soprano Claron McFadden. There are many other roles in the opera so that the singers often take multiple parts. The staging is modernist but tasteful, the costumes understated but appropriate. One outstanding was for a brief scene for Juno (Hera) who started the whole war. She is dressed in a huge peacock crown, furs, excessive jewels and haughty demeanor. The production, sound and lighting all in HD DVD are great! Didone is a keeper.",1198022400,24,2314,4.875634517766497
