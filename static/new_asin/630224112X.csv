441487,5,630224112X,"This movie is a masterpiece. Billy Wilder has made many great films in his celebrated career, but this one is the best he's ever brought to the screen.
The satire and comedy are superb. The acting is at the highest level. The plot is a very clever one,too. I saw this film at my local theater in 1965 after
it was released in late 1964. In 1978 I was fortunate enough to meet Ray Walston and discuss ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" with him; he seemed genuinely pleased that anyone would remember this film,especially since it did not do well at the box office. Maybe it's lack of commercial
success was partly due to the fact that Mr. Wilder exposed a negative trait of middle class American life when he satirized how far some people will go to strike it rich. But I like the idea that Mr. Wilder pulls no punches when he writes and directs for a film that turns out so great on multiple levels.  ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" has had the most influence on me from a celluloid perspective than any film ever made. And Dean Martin has never been better. Obviously, a movie many years ahead of it's time. Don't miss this very entertaining feature film.",1429401600,15,1126,4.413461538461538
441488,5,630224112X,"Widely criticized upon its release as a filthy joke, it has now been re-evaluated as biting satire typical of Wilder.  To be sure, it does not stand with SUNSET BLVD, but it is Billy Wilder, so that alone makes it worthwhile.  Just don't expect the corrosive sting of ACE IN THE HOLE or the side-splitting farce of SOME LIKE IT HOT or the melancoly romanticism of THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.",1428624000,4,400,4.541666666666667
441489,5,630224112X,"This blu ray looks truly stunning- it is one of the best b/w transfers I have seen this far, and I have seen a lot. The sounds does all that it should and works just fine.
I must say that I have never seen a film quite like this one and recommend it whole-heartedly. As a comedy it is one of the best from that period or any other. Most of the time I could not believe what was taking place (considering it was released in 1964), but that made it very interesting. The John Candy-esque Cliff Osmond is the one who really made this film incredible- Ray Walston was very good as well, not to mention Dino, who played a caricature of himself.
There's not much to the plot (like my review), but this one is well worth it.",1426118400,5,717,4.128571428571429

441494,3,630224112X,"""Kiss Me, Stupid"" is a 1964 romantic comedy film starring Dean Martin, Kim Novak, Ray Walston, Felicia Farr, and Cliff Osmond. It is directed by Billy Wilder, written by Wilder and I.A.L Diamond, shot in black-and-white, and released by Lopert Pictures Corporation on December 22, 1964.

INFORMATION THAT IS ON THE BACK OF THE VHS BOX:
{{Quote begin: When jealous piano teacher/songwriter Orville Spooner (Ray Walston) and gas station attendant/lyricist Barney Milsap (Cliff Osmond) find superstar Dino (Dean Martin) has stopped for gas on his way to a TV show taping, they concoct a scheme to trap the singer into staying at Orville's house for the evening, where they plan to subtly serenade him with their own songs. Everything seems like a dream until Orville learns of Dino's voracious appetite for women, and that his own wife, Zelda (Felicia Farr), was once the president of Dino's fan club. He keeps the two from getting together by removing his wife and hiring a replacement/stand-in wife--popular cocktail waitress Polly, the Pistol (Kim Novak)--hoping that a night of wine and romance will put Dina a song-buying mood.

Produced, directed, and co-written by the legendary Billy Wilder (""Some Like It Hot"", ""The Apartment"", and ""Irma la Douce"") and introducing three previously unpublished George and Ira Gershwin, ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" is a hilarious recipe for pure entertainment. Quote end.}}

I must admit that I bought this film because Kim Novak is in it, not because of Dean Martin! I also purchased the film because Marilyn Monroe was supposed to play Polly, the Pistol but died before filming began and while the film was still in pre-production. This film gets an B- to an B grade. I do believe the plot is somewhat dragged and that Kim Novak's role should've been larger.

**If you like Miss Novak or more importantly Mister Martin, I suggest you order this film just to give it a try. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is a outrageously funny? No. (the critics labeled it ""pitifully unfunny"") Is it Martin or Novak's best? No. However, this is an okay film that deserves more attention than it has gotten so in the past and present. So if you shall order it, it's a 50/50 chance you'll like it. I did mildly.",1344643200,5,2217,4.872679045092839
441495,4,630224112X,"A truly odd movie, ""Kiss Me Stupid"" is half masterpiece and half mess. The video version opens with the credits in widescreen, behind which we see Dean Martin in concert in Vegas, casually interrupting Gershwin's  lovely ""S'wonderful"" to make lewd and unfunny jokes. You can feel  Wilder's deep disgust seeping through the crisp black and white images. And  yet he does the same thing he's chastising Dino for: though his story is a  lovely portrait of people finding each other despite society's hypocrisy,  he fouls his own movie with smutty jokes, leering, and crude overemphasis.  Part of the problem is the substitution of Ray Walston for Peter Sellers;  the latter might have made it a sweeter and more moving film, but Walston  is helplessly grating and obnoxious. However, Kim Novak gives a memorable  performance -- not as great as the one she gave in ""Strangers When We  Meet,"" but she's touching and funny as the whore longing for  domesticity. As for Dino, the joke's on him, but as usual he couldn't care  less.",961459200,5,1024,4.855491329479769
441496,5,630224112X,"This is an amazing movie, which was un-successfull when released and has yet to garner public attention.  The film, among other things, is a harsh criticism of America's overzealous and often hypocritical sense of morality  during the 1960's.  This aspect of the film is probably the reason for its  obscurity, but it is also the reason I find this movie so powerfull and  ground breaking.  The film is touching, harsh, funny and disturbing almost  at the same time and also features incredible performances.  If you're a  Dean Martin fan, this movie is a must.  Not only is he great in the film,  but the opening of the movie features live footage from one of his  concerts.  If none of these reasons apeal to you, then see teh movie simply  becuase it was made by a true master Billy Wilder.  See this movie, grant  it the popularity it deserves, but do yourself a favor and see it  widescreen.  You should be able to enjoy the gorgeos and sometimes  powerfully harsh cinematography and framing.  I can only sit by and wait  until this forgotten masterpiece is finally recognized and released on DVD.",946857600,24,1102,4.6947368421052635

441552,5,630224112X,"""One Two Three,"" this is my favorite James Cagney movie (except around the Fourth of July when ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" reigns in my house)!

The generic criticism of this movie is that its jibes at Cold War politics make it more of a period piece appealing only to history majors (and those who lived through the Cold War, like I did).  But well-crafted political satire like ""One Two Three"" is eternal and applies to any political system of whatever ilk in whatever moment in history. Because while political systems change, human nature does not.

As for Mr. Cagney's second to last screen appearance, he was true to form, a brilliantly versatile and multi-talented actor giving an engagingly energetic  performance. Tinsel Town gossip has it that making this film took so much out of him physically and emotionally that he vowed never to return to films. But he did one last time, and the sight of him crippled in a wheelchair attested to how much he gave of himself with every character  he portrayed. The likes of him will never be seen on the silver screen again. But I digress...

441587,5,630224112X,"Here's a terrific (and underrated) Billy Wilder movie, with a terrific Commentary track.  ONE, TWO, THREE was filmed in 1961, when movement between the Allied-forces West Berlin and the Soviet-dominated East Berlin was still relatively free.  While the movie was still in production, though, the Soviets erected the shameful Wall, and a narrative by Jimmy Cagney had to be inserted at the movie's beginning to account for that.  But ONE, TWO, THREE is a hilarious comedy, with slapstick and a VERY fast pace that brings to mind Cagney's rat-a-tat gangster films from the 1930's, and 1940's.  At the time, Europeans and Americans both expected that if World War Three happened, it would start right in Berlin -- which probably accounts for the lackluster reception the film got in American box offices.  However, when the movie was shown a few years later on American TV, and later yet in German cinemas, reaction was jubilant --  the Germans made it a kind of ROCKY HORROR cult movie, even hollering *Sitzen machen!* (""Sit down"") at the screen right before Cagney does (to his overattentive staff at the West Berlin Coca-Cola plant he manages).

Cagney's very able supporting cast includes Pamela Tiffin as a ""hot-blooded"" Southern girl Cagney tries unsuccessfully to chaperone during her visit to Berlin and daughter of the big boss back at Coca-Cola HQ in Atlanta (Howard St. John), Horst Buchholtz as the sexy Commie she falls for, and Arlene Francis as Cagney's humorous but cynical wife.  The Commentary for this film, by historian Michael Schlesinger, is nothing short of superb, giving just the right information (whether biographical, historical, or production-related) at the right time.  I wish all such audio commentaries were half so good, and I wish most movie comedies were half so good as ONE, TWO, THREE.  Buy it!",1501718400,4,1829,5.066666666666666

441596,5,630224112X,"This early 1960s farce was a rare Wilder entry into current events, satirizing corporate greed, opportunistic flag-waving, communist hypocrisy, pop music, and political pragmatism. The film was probably less successful because the broader barbs fell uncomfortably close to their targets, but overall the film holds up well. It's dismaying to think about how many facets of the situation still ring true today. The music and character actors add to the story.

The restored print is glorious and shows the contrast between West Germany's postwar determination to eradicate its fascist wartime history and the East German attempt to direct anger at the capitalist obsessions on the other side of the Brandenburg Gate.

The extras offer some context, but Wilder always preferred funny anecdotes and ingratiating remarks to a lot of discussion. There are several wonderful books on Wilder's career that can tell the full story. I'm hoping someday to see a similar restoration of Wilder's ""Avanti,"" which has a very romantic, bittersweet tone.",1496102400,8,1038,5.401234567901234

""Kiss Me, Stupid"" doesn't seem like the kind of film Dean Martin would be involved in, but after seeing it, I can say he was ideally cast.  It called for a womanizing crooner who hits the bottle, so he was an obvious choice.  Ray Walston was in top form here as the jealous husband, so jealous that he plots to pass off a hired saloon girl as his wife to Dean, in hopes of selling his songs to the well-known singer.  He has to push his wife out the door to carry off the charade and nearly ruins his marriage in the process.  Kim Novak is no less than intoxicating and sensuous in her portrayal as the saloon girl.  You can't pause this movie once you get started.  Felicia Farr plays her role as Walston's real wife to the hilt.  A familiar face, Cliff Osmond, is great as Walston's accomplice in this farce.
