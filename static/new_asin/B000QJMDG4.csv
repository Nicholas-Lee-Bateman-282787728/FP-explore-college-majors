2839042,3,B000QJMDG4,Simple old time entertainment without all the shoot em up and extreme action of today's cinema offerings and free to watch!,1392940800,,123,4.904761904761905
2839043,4,B000QJMDG4,Fun old classic.  Very enjoyable to watch.  Great rainy day pass time.  Interesting to see Ida as a young actress,1391212800,,113,4.55
2839044,1,B000QJMDG4,"We only watched about ten minutes and couldn't take it any longer. For Ida Lupino fans, we advise skipping this one.",1380672000,,116,4.571428571428571
2839045,4,B000QJMDG4,"A perfect or even good copy of this screwball gem doesn't exist.  My copy came from Oldies.com and it's bearable.  Still, one should not overlook the movie itself because it's hilarious and inspired.  Warner Brothers sent many of its stable of zanies into the film along with charming and funny Frances Lederer and young, beautiful Ida Lupino. Donald Meek and Hugh Herbert almost steal the show.  Don't miss this one.",1379203200,5,417,4.914285714285715
2839046,5,B000QJMDG4,"I love funny old movies, and this is one that I enjoy seeing again and again.  Please note - because it came from an old reel, the sound and picture quality aren't perfect.  In fact, some scenes are harder to hear or see than others.  But, it is still enjoyable, nonetheless!",1343260800,3,275,4.352941176470588
2839047,1,B000QJMDG4,BEWARE!  This is another way-below-par release from ALPHA.  You'd be better off saving your cash and watching it on YOUTUBE!,1330128000,6,124,5.15
2839048,5,B000QJMDG4,"Ida Lupino was a powerhouse. Actor, producer and director; one of the first female member of the Director Guild of America. This fine movie is from very early in her American career. Originally from England, she'd only been in America a couple of years when she made this film. She's quite sweet in this romantic comedy; unlike the hard-bitten broads she would play in later film-noir movies.",1229644800,15,392,4.865671641791045
2839049,5,B000QJMDG4,"This is a very funny,classic,romantic comedy that's a must see. It's well worth watching!!!",1181001600,10,91,5.571428571428571

2839052,2,B000QJMDG4,"The performances and the script are good; however, the print is very dark (problem with lighting? the film itself?). Unfortunately, the audio is also bad. If you use the subtitles, yu may be able to follow the dialogue better.",1479600000,2,226,4.82051282051282
2839053,4,B000QJMDG4,Francis Ordered at his best.  Ida Lupino a very small taste of great things to come in her career.,1477612800,,98,4.157894736842105

2839057,2,B000QJMDG4,Mediocre plot line male lead is having an affair with a married woman & ends up kissing a perfect stranger in a movie theater.,1459209600,,126,4.291666666666667
2839058,5,B000QJMDG4,Early picture with Ida lupino....loved it.,1425081600,,42,6.166666666666667
2839059,5,B000QJMDG4,"Ida Lupino was always enjoyable to watch in her various roles, but she was never as sweet and adorable as she was in ""One Rainy Afternoon."" Great leading and supporting actors, and a nice story. And if you don't fall in love with Ida Lupino after watching this little gem of a flick, you must have a heart of stone.",1406937600,5,315,4.266666666666667

8196578,5,B000QJMDG4,"Cute movie about a man who kisses wrong girl when he sits in wrong seat in theater and tons of trouble is caused when the local Moral Majority gets involved and carried away. I like Ida Lupino as the ingenue rather than older woman I'm used to seeing her play and Hugh Herbert is a hoot!
There are two copies of this movie and this is the cleaner version.",1517097600,,355,4.159420289855072
8196579,4,B000QJMDG4,"SYNERGY ARCHIVE SERIES version 2007:
FYI:  The description says this is the 94 minute version of this film, but it is actually the 80 minute version.  IMDB lists two run times, 94 minutes and 80 minutes.  I WANT THE 94 MINUTE VERSION!  Does it exist?",1508112000,,250,4.488888888888889
8196580,5,B000QJMDG4,loved it! laughed smiled and warmed me heart~ and his actor sidekick is a hoot- as fellow actor I found his lines antics funny!,1499990400,,127,4.333333333333333
8196581,4,B000QJMDG4,"The audio is a bit lacking but still clear enough to understand, as with most of these old time videos on Amazon it seems like the captions are completely out of step with the film. The acting is good, the camera work is good and there are very few lingering glances at jokes the director really wanted to give us time to appreciate.

Now for the content warning. This is a film that romanticizes and minimizes sexual assault. If you or the person you're watching with does not want to be exposed to a french man waxing poetic about how grabbing a woman and kissing her is okay don't watch the movie. If you don't want to watch all the people who are anti-accosting women being portray as jealous old bags don't watch the movie. If you don't want to watch the victim pay his bail only to be confronted by him again and again steer clear. If you want to have some insight as to the media landscape that elderly judges grew up in that makes them think a women with too tight jeans can't be assaulted? This might be an interesting bit of media.",1495756800,,1041,4.311224489795919

8196583,5,B000QJMDG4,"A delightful 1936 comedy. You will want to watch it over and over again. An French actor is having an affair with a married woman who doesn't want to be seen in public with her lover. They wait until the movie is started before the go in the theatre in Paris.. It's raining and they circle the block 9 times until the movie has started. He buys the tickets but doesn't notice the numbers of the seats 66 and 68 before he hands his lover her ticket. They go in separately and sit down. He thinks the woman sitting next to him is his lover, but little does he know it is a total stranger in the darkness. He ask her for her program and she hands it to him. He kisses her and she being startled slaps him and screams!  A group of women making up the moral Censors of the censors come out to the wood work, attacking the actor, and calling for the police. The head of the morals group whispers her exaggerated complaint in the cop's ear. and he starts to make an arrest. The handsome actor says all I did was kiss her. The beautiful young woman (Ida Lupino) tries to back out of making a complaint but the actor winds up in jail with a $1,000 FR fine. It was discovered the young woman's father owns one of the biggest newspapers in Paris and the morals go put the pressure on him. The young woman of course doesn't think he will know anything about her adventure. The ask her noble fianc to assist her in the cover up when she is questioned, but when he finds out a stranger has kissed her he is outraged.  The music in the film they attended is haunting throughout the film. Watch the film for the rest.",1485820800,,1601,4.17799352750809
8196584,5,B000QJMDG4,"Not that I approve of men mashing on women in dark movie theaters, but the acting was engaging. If for nothing else, the satire of French bureaucracy (and pretty much all government  bureaucracies and the bending of rules) is very funny.  You will end up with an annoying song in your head, but it will go away in a day or two.",1485043200,3,327,4.258064516129032
8196585,4,B000QJMDG4,"I love this movie and the cast.  However, I have an old VHS of this movie and the picture quality is much better than that of the fuzzy DVD I have just purchased.  I am disappointed.  I see this is one of those ALPHA prints which are not the best.  Couldn't this film be properly restored?  It's certainly worth it.",1484179200,3,315,4.183333333333334
8196586,5,B000QJMDG4,Loved it,1482624000,,8,3.5
8196587,4,B000QJMDG4,"The best words are ""frothy"" and ""charming"" for this romantic comedy offering Francis Lederer and Ida Lupino in what is usually termed a French farce.  We know that Ida went on to a formidable career as both actress and creative mover in films and TV, but I was very curious about Lederer, about whom so much less is known.  Transitioning from work in his native Czechoslovakia, he established himself in Hollywood as a smooth, charming lead actor who loved teaching acting and made a fortune in California real estate.  He continued working (TV) until 1971 so had a very long career notwithstanding the fortune that could have freed him from working.

This film shows him as his most scintillating, charming self and Lupino at the start of a glorious career.  Splendid 1930s sophisticated comic talents Hugh Herbert and Roland Young form part of the supporting cast.",1482192000,5,866,4.904109589041096
