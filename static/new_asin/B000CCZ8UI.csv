8131625,5,B000CCZ8UI,This is not a Hollywood production. This is meant to be an educational movie for young children. It introduces story of Prophet Musa based on Islamic resources. It is a good value for money. Watch trailer first on kidsmedia.net before buying.,1296864000,,242,4.926829268292683
8131626,1,B000CCZ8UI,"I have this video and it has some inaccuracies, especially about the Egyptians.  It says how evil the ancients were, although shortly before Musa, the prophet Joseph (Yusuf) was second in command and was greatly respected by all of Egypt and the Pharaoh of his time.  It also made it look as if the ancients did not do anything on their own and depended on the hebrew slaves for everything, and of course this is completely false, and the Pyramids were not built by slaves, as the video tries to imply.  The animation is also not good, and I did not like it.  The rest of the storyline is pretty accurate and follows the Qur'an, but it is not something I would recommend.  The quality is no good.",1209945600,,696,4.40625
