2317682,5,B0009S2SOY,"This is a marvelous collection of the well-acted, well-written, well-developed British series. Sophisticated humor mixed in with realistic emotional situations.  Touching and funny and thoughtful. The series is highly involving and, like a good book, you hardly can stop at seeing one program.  You have to discipline yourself from losing yourself and watching every single episode at one time.  You cannot possibly OD on this CD series.  One of our best purchases ... ever.",1129075200,4,474,5.364864864864865
2317683,5,B0009S2SOY,"ATGB is a good, funny, simple, sweet show. It's what I turn on when I've had a nightmare or need to escape the world. The characters become people you feel like you know. Sounds sentimental? That's what this show can do to you. There's no blood, death, sex (adults co-habitating is about as racy as it gets), or foul language. If you haven't seen it I encourage you to ask your local PBS station to run it (ours does). As soon as you've seen a few episodes you'll be back to by the DVD's (our VCR recordings of it wore out.) Enjoy!",1126396800,14,531,4.215686274509804
2317684,5,B0009S2SOY,"Since ordering Series 8 and 9 (which was released the same day), have previously ordered 6 and 7 from here, and bought 1 through 5 on my first trip in years to Ohio a few years ago.  I do not need this well priced collection (and it IS well priced).  However I should include a review, as this is one of my favorite britcoms, else I wouldn't be buying it on disc. You get 11 discs (2 of which will be released as 1 set on the same day as this collection). From what I see on the picture of the ""Series 8&9"" 2 bagger just displayed today, the Series 9 will also contain the retrospective ""You Must Remember This"" which previously released separately (between the releases of series 5 and 6) and included 3 other episodes (1 of which was the finale of series 6 which at the time was not on DVD).  Thus making the separate disc of ""You Must Remember This"" nothing but window dressing.  Of course, until the 8&9 set was announced, there was no way to know, so most of us (me included) bought the other disc. Once I got my copy of 8&9, I gave the ""12th disc"" away.  So if you have not gotten any of the series, buy this collection, and you will get it all at a great price.  If you are only missing a few installments, buy the ones you are missing, but skip the separate ""You Must Remember This"" disc, as the episode will be included on the last disc.  After you buy this set, if you haven't already done so, buy ""Reunion"" on the PBS label and OFFICIALLY complete the series.",1117929600,299,1470,4.173144876325089

I can get it on regular TV but only when the weather conditions are right which is rarely.  Judi Dench is one of my favorite actress that we have so few of these days and I love Geoffrey Palmer but there are very few shows I see him.  Tonight I want to watch again but could not get it.

2317763,5,B0009S2SOY,"When this series first started out it was impossible to believe this couple had any genuine feelings for one another in the distant past.  They were immediately argumentative, confrontational, and combative.  They bickered and insulted one another in a manner less than endearing.  They had an adversarial relationship sorely in need of repair.  Eventually, finally, they reconnected and the series became a joy to watch.

The cast is perfect.  The situations are handled with great humor (although it eventually gave Judi Dench (as Jean Pargetter) a few too many 'I Love Lucy' moments listening at closed doors, contriving reasons to spy on new neighbors, plotting to help couples fall in and out of love, offering false information to the police, and manipulating poor Lionel (Geoffrey Palmer) into doing her dirty work for her.  Some of the plot lines frayed over the years.  Or were completely dropped, like the imminent death of Lionels dad Rocky (Frank Middlemass).  But through it all they managed to make you care about these characters.",1473552000,12,1045,5.136094674556213

All the characters are believable and you feel each time you watch an episode that you're visiting old friends, rather than being entertained.  Intelligent, well executed, well acted, well done.",1435449600,6,388,4.7611940298507465

2317840,5,B0009S2SOY,"As Time Goes By was an unexpected pleasure to discover. We bought Series Three of this British sitcom at Mission Possible Thrift Store in Pinson. We enjoyed watching it and then bought the Complete Original Series in ""very good"" condition on Amazon for $77. There are nine series totaling 64 episodes plus an hour long compilation in the set. They were broadcast between 1992 and 2002 on P.B.S.
We haven't purchased the two reunion specials which were broadcast a few years apart after the primary series ended in 2002 but I'm sure that we will at some point in the future.
The story lines are clean, the dialogue is sharply written and intelligent and the humor is gentle and hilarious. There is no profanity or nudity and the slight sexual innuendo is in extremely good taste. ATGB is a lot like the old motion picture comedies of the 30's and 40's. It's the kind of program that you want to last a long time. That's why we're watching one episode every Sunday night for the next 64 weeks. A real treasure!",1431820800,4,1008,4.574585635359116

What I find annoying, is when you have gotten used to the same characters over and over, all of a sudden, new characters come on the scene and you find them insistently annoying. And the way Lionel doesn't speak for himself after Jean has her say on certain matters. All that being said, it's a great show to watch, for something different, other than all the other overseas TV series out there.",1424822400,,615,4.264957264957265

This is the later series she did (an earlier one she played opposite of her real life husband) and never get tired of these.  I am glad to be able to watch them in order whenever I like as PBS sometimes rotate shows during seasons and it seems like the British Comedies are becoming scarcer on our local station.  The set is always a bit pricy but you can find it on sale and buy new/used copies as well which I have had excellent luck with.

Just be cautious that the video ""up close"" like many of these early British BBC shows, have a ""crape"" like look to them not noticeable if you sit further back.  And all were done in 4:3 ratio except the last few that were done in widescreen.  Too bad not all were done that way.  There is a special using flashback scenes taken from early episodes zoomed in to make them widescreen but the crape effect is not as noticeable.

The actors are Geoffrey Palmer, Judi Dench, Jenny Funnel, Moiria Brooker and Philip Bretherton and others. No Lynda Bellingham. None the less, I have watched the entire series and have the reunion specials as well. I would NOT order You Must Remember This DVD as it is just a series of short clips of some memorable clips, shown one at a time with no logical sequence.

2317934,5,B0009S2SOY,"I have watched this series so many times since I first saw it on my local PBS station back in the mid 1990s. Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer play a couple that originally met when they were in their late teens. She was a nurse, he, a soldier, during the time of the Korean War. They fell in love and had dreamed of living their lives together. That is until Lionel is stationed in Korea, leaving Jean behind in England. As so many separated young lovers they plan to write. And they do. But neither letter gets delivered. And both believe the other has moved on. Jean later marries and has a daughter. Lionel also marries and becomes a coffee farmer in Kenya. Thirty-eight years later, completely by accident, they meet again. Both blaming the other for never writing. By this time, Lionel is divorced and Jean is a widow. Thus begins the story of a love that never died between two people who no longer know each other... or do they? Their idiosyncrasies are the fun as they get to know each other again. And the supporting cast has their own unique problems! You will laugh and on rare occasions you might shed a tear or two.  Start at the beginning and you will come to love these people as much as I have. Yes, I did buy the series, only to find that there were two more seasons that our local PBS had never shown. So even if you think you've seen it all, there may still be new stories to watch. Enjoy! I still do!",1401062400,6,1423,4.289962825278811

2317937,5,B0009S2SOY,"Dame Judy Dench fans rejoice- 9 series of her wonderful acting. This is a gentle comedy- no raunchiness, not much swearing, no overt sex. Instead, you see an older couple, finding each other again after 38 years, and putting together a brand-new relationship. Unlike many other rom coms, this one doesn't end when they get married. Instead, it gets better as they work through late-life romance and living together issues.
There are some truly laugh-out-loud moments in every episode, plus characters you will fall in love with. The live audience sometimes gets in the way in early episodes, but that gets ironed out.
Truly one of my favourites.",1400025600,,645,4.981481481481482

Two people fall in love, he goes off to war she continues with nursing school, he sends her a letter to let her know where he has been sent, which she never gets. Thinking he is no longer interested she moves on with her life. He having never received an answer from her thinks the same thing of her and so moves on with his life. They both marry other people, she has a daughter and becomes a widow. He ends up divorced after years of marriage that just never lived up to the past. 30 years later they meet up again and find they are just as in love as they had been before. Both have developed set lifestyles they are used to and the fun begins as they try to establish the relationship from before, in the life they each now have today. Through in his eccentric father who decides to marry a younger woman and who live in a small village.....well you just have fun coming from all directions.",1399939200,5,1018,4.146464646464646

What a pleasure it was to watch the episodes in order!!  LOL!  Since we're an older widowed couple, our dating seemed to mirror theirs in a lot of ways.  A few times every week we watch an episode before we go to bed - calms us at the end of the day. We've watched the series all the way through 7 times now since we've been married. We start in the fall and watch them all until we finish in the spring. I'm always excited to start the series over.

2317973,5,B0009S2SOY,"I will keep my comments brief since literally hundreds of people have already reviewed this series.

This show is a great choice if you're tired of brash, loud guttermouths (no, I'm not talking about you, Chapelle) and overly-topical political satirists (no, I'm not talking about you, either, Colbert).

The acting is superb (and it's very possibly the acting that keeps this now-dated show very funny and watchable). What needs saying about Judi Dench? If you haven't seen her in comedy before, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well she can turn a funny phrase as the sharp-as-a-whip executive Jean. Geoffrey Palmer is giggle-worthy as the grumpy and clueless but gallant Lionel. The supporting cast provides a good balance between these two titans (in terms of both gender and intelligence).

This is a gentle show for several reasons, but the most notable one is that the comedy is CLEAN most of the time. You could play most episodes of this show for your prudish elderly relatives without making them blush. Children might also find a few laughs since there is some physical comedy sprinkled around. This means, of course, that the writing has to be strong to make up for a lack of swearing or smutty plots...which it is in spades. There are actually some very level-headed observations in this show. It gives honest but wonderfully optimistic thoughts on aging and romance, and this alone makes it worth watching. Few topics are ignored, and the ones mentioned always put a dignified light on an issue. These characters aren't perfect, but they're willing to admit that as they deal with their problems. The solutions they come to are often funny and heartwarming at the same time, leaving you with that cliched but enormously appreciated ""warm, fuzzy feeling."" The plausible premise of the show (a relationship halted not by a breakup but instead by one lost letter in the mail) keeps it very down-to-earth: Jean and Lionel are a loving couple, but their ""second chance"" was itself a slim chance.

I definitely recommend getting the entire series (though there are times when it may be cheaper to buy seasons separately instead of as a box set).",1389657600,2,2158,4.9366391184573

2318017,5,B0009S2SOY,"Sitting down to watch this series is like curling up under a favorite blanket on the couch with a beloved book, one that you've read many times.  It's cozy and funny and silly and very well written, a show that warms your heart.

Judi Dench is, as ever, marvelous in her portrayal of Jean, a woman who runs an agency that supplies a typist for Lionel Hardcastle (the also familiar Geoffrey Palmer you might recall from other BBC shows) when he is finishing up a book about his life in Kenya as a coffee-grower.  But, surprise surprise, it turns out that years ago they were an item and lost touch during the war due to a missing letter.  At first, they resist renewing their interest in each other, but that old spark is still there...

Other characters include Jean's secretary and her daughter.  Lionel's father and his father's girlfriend are fun and quirky.  Still, the most interesting secondary character is Allister, Lionel's agent--a man who you end up finding fascinating and annoying, sometimes both at the same time.

If you are looking for rip-roaring comedy or lots of slapstick, you won't find it here.  This is a gentle comedy, full of all of the normal problems and silliness of regular life.  This is a show about real people and how love can renew itself even after over 30 years apart and after two people have grown older in the meantime.

The dialogue in this show is wonderful, but the best is reserved for the interplay between Jean and Lionel (of course) who are played marvelously by Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer.  They are very believable characters and you end up invested in their re-blossoming relationship.

Probably not the best BBC comedy show ever (my vote would run towards The Good Life, Butterflies, and To the Manor Born), but very much worth watching.",1372204800,,1791,4.701923076923077
2318018,5,B0009S2SOY,"This is far from my favorite BBC sitcom, but I found that it is perfect for a quiet evening at home, especially right before bedtime.

Not only is the show smartly written, but it stars one of the greatest actresses ever- Dame Judi Dench!  Judi leads a fabulous ensemble of very talented actors/actresses and every episode leaves you wanting more.

2318050,4,B0009S2SOY,"AS TIME GOES BY was one of the BBC's fondly remembered sitcoms of the 1990s - not so much because of the originality of the scripts (which were nonetheless well structured) but because of the acting.  Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer as the lovers meeting once again after four decades were consistently entertaining; they formed a double-act who were at once worldly-wise yet optimistic, aware of the absurdities of the contemporary world yet ever-willing to embrace them.  The supporting cast was equally good: Frank Middlemass and Joan Sims as Palmer's (screen) parents were consistently delightful, with their tendency to do outlandish things and make outlandish statements. These eleven discs contain every episode that was made: well worth the money.",1356739200,,754,5.3277310924369745

After watching one episode, we were hooked!  The actors portray their characters so well!  The relationships are funny, warm, and sincere. We felt as if we were transported back into a simpler time with absolutely no vulgar language, bloody crimes, or sour attitudes toward traditions and family life--what a welcome relief from current TV shows.

We just had to order the entire series so we could have the pleasure of watching the plot line unfold from the beginning. The set of DVD's came as a nice boxed set, factory sealed and in perfect condition.  Currently, we are midway after watching several episodes every few nights. ""Jean"" and ""Lionel"" have conversations laced with witty remarks that keep us laughing out loud.

This is a comedy/romance series that will probably appeal more to those of us who are over 50.  Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer are superb in their roles, as are all other members of the cast - even though this is a 10-year-old program, it still holds true in its beauty and the way that the characters care for each other.  It does not resort to the slapstick, pie-in-the-face kind of humor to get you to laugh - and laugh you will with the wit and wonderful dialogues.

I only saw every other show of ""As Times Goes By"" when it was on PBS so having all the episodes will fill in all the gaps and I will see how everything turns out. I love the writing and the characters are funny, charming, and a bit mischievous at times but at the end of each show it leaves me saying ""wow, this is a really good show!""

The writing was very well done and the casting was superb.  We had passed on purchasing the series a few times, but this time decided to take the plunge.  So far we have not been disappointed.  The quality of the video appears to be so much better that what the PBS station broadcasts.  It is even full screen, and not the smaller side letterboxed images transmitted on Saturday nights.  We are up to Season 8 already, having mini As Time Goes By film festivals, watching as many episodes as we can at once, knowing that when we are done, we can start all over again.

Even though every time I think of this show the first word that pops into my head is ""boring"" I have to admit that somehow I have become addicted to it.  The relationships between the characters are sweet and endearing.  As a comedy, the funniest thing to me was the misperceptions the writers of this show have about Americans, (particularly Idaho).

And, not surprisingly, that is exactly what ""As Time Goes By"" is....GREAT.  But, it goes further of course.  BBC production standards are among the world's best; BBC directors are exemplary; and BBC writers are enviable.  Put them all together and the series just cannot be anything other than a magical delight.  It is hilarity balanced by poignancy, light-heartedness balanced by some pretty heavy truths; good plain fun without a single put-down or disgusting word.  And guess what?  They pull off nine whole seasons without a single graphic sex scene, no more than a very rare mild expletive, and not a second of bare flesh...those things which seem to be presumed necessities in many of today's offerings.

habits, views of life, and the viewer learns about ""channel reports"" and ""lemon

I can't explain the attraction other than the excellent writing and cast, it just has a special quality about it that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. This show really grows on you and you will love it forever.",1297728000,2,375,4.295774647887324
2318103,5,B0009S2SOY,Extremely funny and very enjoyable.  Can't understand why the series ended.  The reunion special was especially nice since it gives some closure to what happened to all of the shows characters after the series ended.  LOVE LOVE LOVE,1297209600,2,232,5.052631578947368

2318106,5,B0009S2SOY,"Quite possibly the greatest television series on either side of the pond. It is unimaginable that a series centered about the love affair of two people older than 40 would ever be made in the US, but thankfully the powers that be in the UK helped create a truly original masterpiece. The acting is uniformly superb, but Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer are in a league of their own. There are times when it truly feels as if a camera has dropped into a real life conversation or situation because the intamcy is so palpable. Not to mention that there are just as many moments eliciting laughter out loud. This series is highly recommended to anyone who appreciates poignancy, wit and comedy written without overt sentimentality. Every aspect of the series, including the writing and direction, is done with an attention to detail most often ignored in many sitcoms currently produced. Give yourself and the one you love a real treat and watch this brilliant creation.",1296086400,2,965,4.819277108433735

Lionel was in the Korean war; this makes the couple our age and relevant to the times.  The dialogue is clever; each episode has something of importance in it...humor, romance, and ""goodness"".  It is the favorite of my 20-yr old granddaughter, and I am almost 80, so I think this is for everyone!",1294790400,3,436,4.481012658227848

But one night during Winter Fest they showed a marathon of ATGB and OMG I was IN LOVE!! This has got to be one of the best shows ever. I have honestly seen the entire series at least 6 or 7 times on reruns on PBS and I still laugh at them. There is no American show that comes close to the quality of this. Its funny without being lewd and crude, no cussing or overly sexual. Now I love my American tv shows, but the Brits...they just know how to write. I think a lot of people would be surprised how many British shows get remade in to American shows (not just The Office either). By the way its not just for the older crowd I fell in love with this shows when I was 20 and 5 yrs later I still rush home on Saturday nights to watch this at 8 on my PBS.

2318115,5,B0009S2SOY,"I love this series. It just feels like a warm hug. Warm, gentle humor, which will always make you smile and often laugh out loud.

Being English, this is always a nice cure for homesickness. If you are an Anglophile, then this is definitely the series for you. Lionel and Jean were courting when Lionel was posted to Korea. They were parted by a lost letter and have a chance meeting 38 years later.

Judi Dench is wonderful as a woman learning to be comfortable again with the man she loved many years ago and Geoffrey Palmer is charming and always makes me smile.

My favorite moments are when Jean is trying to calculate how many people they can fit into the front room, which turns into an argument about how people gesture with their arms when they talk, and Lionel individually wrapping cupcakes because he wasn't told to put them into a container and wrap the container as a whole. Brilliant. Not in your face, slapstick jokes, but the kind of humor that makes you feel warm inside and makes the show watchable over and over again.",1291852800,,1038,4.51063829787234

I have wanted to own this series for several years now, so I decided to go ahead and order it. I love to watch Jean, Lionel and all the other great characters on the show. I have also wanted to watch the entire series in order from its beginning to the final episode, something I can't do on PBS. I can now enjoy the series whenever I like.

It's as delightful as it was when we watched it each week on PBS, but now we're able to catch the episodes we missed before.  Our only complaint (and it's minor) is that the background music is sometimes a bit loud and drowns out the conversations of the actors.

Season 9 is not formatted in the same way as the others; the screen image is ""squeezed"" vertically.  Not fatal issues, but annoying.",1269993600,32,419,4.2784810126582276

Having the complete series also meant we were able to watch the series in chronological order, which really helped as the episodes are linked in this way. We have always been a fan of comedy which is subtle and does not involve shouting or slapstick antics and this is perhaps the most enjoyable series we have ever watched. Although we are nowhere near their ages, we can identify with Lionel and Jeanne so well it almost seems we are watching ourselves on video. We would certainly recommend this series to anyone.

I wasn't sure she would enjoy these because of the high brow humor. She loves them! It's been the first entertainment we both have been able to agree on. She watches them over and over and I think they might belong to her now. lol In short, if you are thinking of purchasing them do it.

2318221,5,B0009S2SOY,"The first thing you have to know:  This show is special.

Why is it special?  The characters matter. They are decent people leading decent lives, and you get to share time with them as they explore their relationships.  Their relationships matter- when these characters meet and fall in love, or re-fall in love, or hurt eachother without even meaning to, you care.  This isn't Ross and Rachel leading self-involved lives of desperate selfishness, but honest to goodness people trying to do what's right but occasionally getting it all wrong.

It's funny.  Side splittingly funny at points. Lionel (Geoffery Palmer) can be a grump, and his stodgeyness is a fantastic foil for the other characters to play against.  Jean (Judi Dench) is a bit of a busybody, but in a completely unannoying way- and her meddling leads to many humorous situations over the course of the show.

There are no real minor characters in this program- every character has their moments in the spotlight, to grow and challenge themselves.

My wife and I love this show and we return to it often, just to spend some more time with these fantastic characters.",1257811200,3,1130,4.869109947643979

Dame Judi Dench is her always marvelous self, Geoffery Palmer is romantic but not fake. The supporting cast members are funny, bright and believable.

I don't know how the cameras avoided catching me on film, but there are no hard feelings.  It was simply an honor being part of this warm, tender and hilarious family and their adventures in life.

2318226,5,B0009S2SOY,"First of all; British television, especially that offered by the BBC, is light-years ahead of American television in the areas of writing, directing, acting, producing, class, and longevity of appeal. This particular series is simply the finest body of television work it has been my pleasure to watch. The continued appeal of series such as ""Are You Being Served?"",""One Foot In The Grave"", ""Danger Man"" (seen in his country as ""Secret Agent Man"") attests to the extreme high-quality of British television productions. Dame Judi Dench, Geoffrey Palmer and the remainder of the cast of ""As Time Goes By"" smoke all American actors I've seen in their ability to actually pull you into the story line; effecting outbursts of spontaneous  laughter  from myself; alternating with actual tears from a man who normally does not allow any movie or television show to affect me such. (Please forgive my poor grammar.)I actally found myself wanting to know the characters in this series; and to want to invite some of them into my home. The only American entertainer I could say that about was the late Johnny Carson. To sum it up: This series is well worth the money; I've had the series for three weeks and have watched it completely through twice!",1252972800,18,1239,4.923444976076555

2318250,5,B0009S2SOY,"Many Americans don't realize that Judi Dench was a terrific comedic actress on British tv.  An earlier sitcom she did with her own real life husband was A FINE ROMANCE, which I also loved. This series begins when she discovers her own daughter going out with a much older man.  This man is her own lost love from days of the Korean War.  She was a nurse and he was a solider.  They were in love but lost touch.  He is divorced and returned from years in Kenya and she is widowed with one daughter and the owner of a successful secretarial staffing firm.

The rest of the series rests on this romance, between Jean (Dench) and Lionel (Geoffrey Palmer).  It brings a lot of other lovable characters into the mix.  My favorites were Stephen, the dentist brother-in-law of Jean's; Rocky, Lionel's father and Alistair, Lionel's publisher (of his horrible MY LIFE IN KENYA) and future suitor to Jean's daughter Judy.

I fell in love with these characters.  Judi Dench is the zany comedian who keeps the comedy centered whereas Lionel is more the straight man.  Jean pokes her nose into everyone's business (just like Lucy Ricardo did) and this is the set up for every other character's subsequent development.  For one example, she initially tells Penny and Stephen (her former in-laws) that Lionel is a psychiatrist in order to impress them (he is not).  So Lionel subsequently gets stuck analyzing Stephen the dentist, one of the high points in all of situation comedy.

Jean and Lionel are a very believable couple along with being a humorous one.  I've seen the entire series twice and am looking forward to viewing #3.

2318254,4,B0009S2SOY,"As Time Goes By stars the incredible Dame Judi Dench OBE CH and Geoffrey Palmer OBE as former lovers who reunite after 38 years by accident. Judi plays Jean Pargeter, a widow who ran her own typing agency called Type for You which is like assigning secretaries for her clients. Her secretary, Sandy, is well-played by the actress and her daughter, Judith, is played by Moira Brooker who became an actress after watching Judi play Lady Macbeth. Despite Judi Dench's honors and awards, she can still do a sitcom. Unfortunately, she's very dry and British but does a great job in sometimes corny situations like when her sister-in-law of her late husband played brilliantly by Moyra Fraser bumps into her at a music store. Instead of telling Penny and her dentist husband, Stephen, that Lionel Hardcastle (played by Palmer) was a writer who just written his memoirs about his life in Kenya, she tells them that he's a psychiatrist who she met on the dodgems instead of 38 years ago before Korea and her marriage to Penny's brother. Penny and Stephen are childless couple who have been married for years and Penny runs the household and the marriage.

Lionel's father, the late wonderful Frank Middlemass plays Rocky Hardcastle who decides to get married to the funny and charming, Madge, and honeymoon in Memphis. Rocky and Madge are big country music fans and are going to Graceland. They also love Johnny Cash and other country music without being over the top. Madge is played by the queen of the Carry On comedies, Joan Sims, who should have been made a Dame herself. Unfortunately, both the actors who played Rocky and Madge are gone in real life. Sims died in 2001 and Middlemass died a couple years ago but they are brilliant to watch. Also there is Mrs. Bale played by Janet Henfrey who reminds you of Allison Janney. She is a divorced woman who is a devoted housekeeper to senior Hardcastle and is like a member of the family.

Rounding out the cast is Lionel's publisher, Alistair, played by Philip Bretherton who outdoes the role but makes him believable. Alistair falls in love with Jean but ends up with Judith. Sandy has somebody else. The series was never outrageous like other British comedies. There is almost 100 episodes of the series. According to Judi, the acting legend as she has been described, she prefers stage first, television second and film third. Because in television unlike films, she can revisit the character like Jean Pargeter Hardcastle and make her better each time. She does it naturally rather than over the top. The show is still shown wildly on American public television stations and is popular more than ever.

I have written to Geoffrey Palmer once and Judi Dench twice and received responses. Believe it or not, they are down to earth and enjoy doing this series. Palmer could easily play Nixon, he has such a strong resemblance. With As Time Goes By, there are no losers but winners and hopeless romantics for a good romance story with all the problems intended.",1249257600,5,3006,4.788053949903661

But with Judi Dench, Geoffrey Palmer, Philip Bretherton, Moira Brooker and Jenny Funnel you feel like they are a family that you would like to keep!  It is a joy every time we watch it.

My family and I had to put it on pause several times because we were laughing too hard and couldn't hear what was said next. It's one of the best series that I've seen. There is a wonderful balance between the characters. Jean is a mid-fifties woman who owns a secretarial business. She has a daughter and a secretary of whom she is friends with. Nigel is a mid fifties to late fifties ex soldier who is in the middle of writing his autobiography. He is using the services of one of Jean's secretaries but the woman is a terrible secretary. So Jeans daughter goes to fix the situation. Nigel asks her to have dinner but when he picks her up at her mothers place, were she live, he sees Jean and immediately there is a dj vous. The discover that they had been lovers 15 years earlier when he was a soldier and she was a nurse stationed near each other. I'm not going to tell in detail what happened.

2318266,5,B0009S2SOY,"It's all been said in other reviews. The number rated 5-star tells the story. This is a delightful series about a couple once in love, separated by a war, and then finding each other again after 38 years. A second chance risked and devoured.  It deals with the life of older citizens, but a pair who have not given over to the rocking chair. A lively couple. And the younger set they live, work, and love with.

Sarcasm is the mode of endearment, and leave the viewer laughing out loud.

One negative was discovered after 15 hours of watching, about half-way through the set. I knew both my wife and I had fallen for this series and the characters, and they become like family. They will be missed when the end comes, and they were. In that way, this series is not unlike, ""Monarch of the Glen,"" ""The Grand,"" ""The Darling Buds of May,"" ""The Duchess of Duke Street,"" & ""The Pallisers."" Check out my reviews on those sets as well. Good stuff. One masterful addition to this set is the DVD set's ending with ""You Must Remember This"". In that special episode Lionel is being encouraged to write a book about his life with Jean, at their older age.  The second chance love. Many happy replayed scenes occur as they remember. Viewers get a recap of the series. A nice touch.

This is a must-own set for Judi Dench fans, perhaps her finest performance. Geoffrey Palmer as ""Li"" is also top notch, spot-on. A dozen more characters could be listed and praised.

Another good comparison is ""Affairs of the Heart"".
This is as honestly romantic (not sappy syrupy) as ""Nights of Rodanthe.""  Again both highly recommended just like ""As Time Goes By.""

Divide the cost of this complete set by 32 hours and you will find ""As Time Goes By"" to be a bargain in entertainment. AND you will watch it more than just once.",1240963200,3,1798,4.493865030674846

2318270,5,B0009S2SOY,"So many reviewers have rightly described this series as touching, even moving, that prospective buyers who haven't yet seen any episodes should be reassured that it is also incredibly funny. In fact,time after time the quality and depth of the writing and acting easily manage to induce both responses simultaneously. This is simply one of the best, maybe the best, comedy series ever made. Some others on the shortlist, from both sides of the Atlantic, would be Cheers, the brilliant earlier seasons of Frasier before it ran out of steam after Niles and Daphne got together, and, from the U.K., Waiting for God. Some popular choices seem overrated to me. Seinfeld? Not nearly as funny on the second viewing, and so cold at heart. Benny Hill? Funny sometimes, but on a shallow, one dimensional level. Monty Python? Some brilliant moments, but to get to these you have to sit through long stretches of dull self-indulgence and self-congratulation from the cast(likewise Saturday Night Live).Friends?  The most overrated of all. Shallow, implausible characters, but aren't they just so cute, and don't they know it? O.K.,maybe I'm venting a bit , but I can connect this up, as they say in just about every courtroom scene. As Time Goes By, Waiting for God, and Frasier, are not ""ageist"". There are important characters from different generations as integral parts of the story (as in Cheers until ""Coach"" died in real life). In Seinfeld, Friends, and so many other sitcoms, British and American, all the principal characters have roughly the same age, usually between 18 and 40, given the advertisers' obsession with this demographic. Of course parents versus young or adolescent children is a sitcom cliche, but other generation gaps are uncommon. In the best comedy series the differences between generations provide both great humor and emotion.  So why do love As Time Goes By? A great story, great acting, great comedy. The best!",1238889600,,1932,5.053291536050157
2318271,5,B0009S2SOY,"The newest complete 11 disk box set, released with UPC 794051-236227, consists of 2 folders, one with 5 disks and one with 6 disks, and it needs some explaining.

When you first get it and look only at the top titles of each disk it looks like the series is not complete and the disks are out of order. But if you examine them carefully you will find the set is complete. I had to take a felt tip marker and label the disks from 1 to 11. If you got the prior mega set with 6 individual cases in the box, then this does not apply to you. Also, there is no complete episode list included. I went to [...] and found it, by typing in ""As Time Goes By"" and then following the link for the full episode list.

No competition, no life-threatening illness, no foul language to endure, and low and behold - they actually work for a living! - just a pleasant trip somewhere else to wrap up my day (or interrupt a bad one)...does make me want to visit England, tho, sit in that kitchen with a cup o' tea or go across the way for a pint....",1237766400,,808,4.357615894039735

2318295,5,B0009S2SOY,"I really like the series.  Both the actors and the writers are skillful and believable.  By owning the DVDs I was able to watch a series of programs consecutively, thereby, watching the plot develop as one would watch a play.  Later, I watched selected episodes which focused on character development.  For example, Lionel is consistent across time.  You can see by the different situations that he is struggling to renew his life and relationships but is not a push over.  The program is reflective of real life, yet, the optimistic ends were achieved in a realistic way.  I like juggling the sequences to understand the great writing and to laugh a bit at the British ""way"".  I like England and this show helps me find old memories.",1223942400,3,734,4.724409448818897

I enjoyed the series on TV and I am enjoying it so much more without the interruptions and having to depend on PBS to get the episodes in the proper sequence. The only negative is that I do not enjoy the BBC commercials at the beginning of the last half of the DVD's.

You'll find no better actress anywhere than Judi Dench with a wonderful supporting cast -- Buy it either for yourself or a friend and I promise you won't regret it.",1198800000,,460,4.597560975609756
2318309,5,B0009S2SOY,"My significant other and I have been watching this for about a year on PBS. We're generally fond of British comedy, but even by those standards this is amazingly well done. She bought me the whole set for Christmas and we've both been captured by the extra depth those early episodes bring to the characters. Who knew Lionel was an old dog who chased skirts -- least of all those of Judy and Sandy? I remember a vague reference, in the later episodes we had already seen, to Jean and Alistair having a brief thing, but this was also a pretty rich thread; when you actually see it happen, it's funnier than you thought the premise could be.

I'd like to echo some of what others here have said: My significant other and I are younger than Jean and Lionel by ten years at least, but we met in our '40s and we identify with what Jean and Lionel project so well --the bittersweetness that comes with knowing you were extemely lucky to find the love of your life when many of your years are behind you, the sadness at having missed so much of the other's life. Also, the man who said this show spans many people's tastes in TV has it exactly right. My SO and I have very, very different tastes, in that I love Weeds and Californication, not to mention the books I read, and she's more into less-edgy, softer, ""family-oriented"" crap... (oops, did I say that aloud?)  With this show, we both adored it from the first. I asked her why she liked it and she said it seemed 'sweet' and 'real', which is exactly what I think. The jokes rarely seem forced and overwritten like American TV (think Three's Company and later Mork and Mindy); my SO said she hates laugh tracks and she was so glad this doesn't have one... until I pointed out that it does, in fact, have one...:-) I guess it's just not very obtrusive...

Anyway, it's an awesome set. And I love PBS, but sitting through a pledge drive to get these DVDs taxes even my prodigious patience. This is not cheap, but much less time-consuming.",1198800000,2,1985,4.4032697547683926

2318311,5,B0009S2SOY,"If I could I'd give this series 10 stars!  The story line is delightful; humorous and touching at times. It focuses on lost love regained many years later. A lost letter separated them during the Korean War and they led different lives than they had planned. They are reunited by accident, with an awkward courting of Jean by fumbling Lionel. Along with these two main characters are Jean's (Dench) daughter; the upbeat book publisher Alistair; the bubbly secratary Sandy: and Lionel's free spirited father round out an excellent cast of characters. Each character has qualities  that compliment each other. Lionel's dour personality and Jean's worrying along with Alistair's positive attitude lead to mischief and humor. A fine example of Classic English TV.  Buy it, even though it is pricey for the whole set, you will not be sorry!",1198368000,,835,5.036231884057971

2318318,5,B0009S2SOY,"My wife and I adore this show.  Bob Larby is a great writer and wrote every single episode in the As Time Goes By series (he also wrote for ""Good Neighbors"").  We started watching the Brit-coms on PBS and eventually fell in love with this show.  I watch an episode almost every night even though I've seen them all ""oodles"" of times.  We bought series 1 & 2 from Amazon and loved it so much that we sprung for the Complete Series and have never regretted a moment.  Charmed, soothed, and a good laugh is what you'll get from every episode.  It's a pity that they couldn't continue the series forever.  When the very last episode aired on TV in England, one news source stated:  ""Tonight, a little piece of England died.""  To some extent, it was actually a bigger hit in America than Britain.  It is a bit ""slower"" and less ""madcap"" than many British comedies but in my opinion more poiniant and endearing.  The Lionel Hardcastle character is written a little overly-grumpy (that British aristocracy syndrome) but that tension is what causes the show to have its dialogue jump back and forth between characters.  All of the actors are great - not to take anything away from their abilities - but the writing is what is key.  The excellence of the casting and acting is what rounds-out the whole thing and makes it ""magic"".  They strum a beautiful chord together.  Jean, played by Judi Dench, is a master of the ""double-takes"".  Like Lucille Ball in the ""I love Lucy"" show who winds up trying to ""white-lie"" her way out of sticky situations, Jean does some of the same - albeit not because she is ditsy the way that Lucy was, but mostly to save face and look the ""proper lady"".

I really can't say enough about this show so I'll stop.  Words fail.",1187308800,8,1745,4.485714285714286

She does not know where to find him and the relationship is broken off. Thirty years later they chance to meet again, he divorced, she a widow. They resume their relationship and the series goes on from there.

Now that you have the bare bones of the story line, you might think there is little to watch here.  You would be correct if you are a fan of Hollywood or commercial television's presentations of stupid people, acting in stupid ways and being affected by totally outlandish, and idotic outcomes.

Lionel Hardcastle and Jean Pargeter show us real life incidents that have been presented in comedic ways. You have to laugh at them because the situations presented are really quite funny. The dialogues were written by masters--the language and vocabulary are geared to intelligent people and not the 10 year-olds of commercial television. As for the situations that take place, everyone has experienced moments when something happened to him or her in spite of their best efforts. The results are not what were desired and the perpetrator might look rather foolish afterwards, but the foolishness leaves everyone concerned laughing at the unexpected outcome, not feeling like buffoons.  The entire program is on an intellectual level that does not demean the viewer.  In fact, the entire program uplifts the viewer and every program leaves you feeling that you have had a real, ""solid"" infusion of life and all its meaningful comedy. All the supporting actors play roles that are extremely endearing and funny too.  The plot line is continuous over the series, but each program is a complete set of incidents with a central point about them; it really does not matter if you can watch only selected episodes or all.  Of course, watching all in sequence is a particular joy and that is why you should get the series.",1178928000,13,1945,4.8343373493975905

It is probably the best money I have ever spent for any entertainment product. The show is delightfully funny with just the proper touch of pathos. It is the story of two middle age people who rekindle a long lost romance that, by the hand of fate, ended before it had a chance to truly blossom. Bring into that a young daughter, some very entertaining family and friends and you have a mixture of characters and stories that will keep you entertained for many, many hours. All of the actors are superb and unbelievably talented, but the story is really carried by Dame Judi Dench and Geoffery Palmer. The lively banter between these two is funniest part of the show. And throughout the nine seasons they never seemed to tire of their roles and the writing never sags. It is just a very funny, well done TV show and well worth the investment to buy it. I actually was sad to watch the last episode. If you want 60 plus episodes of excellent comedy, buy the entire series.",1176422400,67,1137,4.367924528301887

2318340,5,B0009S2SOY,"My review title says it all - As Time Goes By is absolutely the best show on television.  It is only shown on Public Television, and most stations will show it along with a variety of other British Comedies.  The series is based on a British nurse, Jean Pargitter, and a British lieutenant, Lionel Hardcastle, falling in love.  Lionel is assigned to duty in Korea.  His letter to Judy telling her where she can write to him in Korea becomes lost.  Jean thinks Lionel never wrote, and Lionel thinks Jean never answered his letter.  Their lives take separate paths, and they meet by accident thirty-eight years later.  Judy Dench (now Dame Judy Dench) is absolutely superb as Jean Pargitter and Geoffrey Palmer does a wonderful job as Lionel Hardcastle.  The supporting cast of Moira Brooker as Judy, Jean's daughter, and Jenny Funnell as Jean's secretary at her secretarial agency, and Philip Bretherton as Alister Deacon, Lionel's publisher, are all a perfect fit.  In general, reruns can become tiring after a while.  However, this particular series is one of those rare exceptions.  It was worth the price to have a real classic that can be viewed from beginning to end and start over again and again without losing anything.

The series deals with an aging couple rekindling an old romance.  Both characters are somewhat curmudgeonly and there's just as much fussing as cuddling as well as a lot of fun in between.  Jean's daughter Judith, her secretary, Sandy, and Lionel's publisher, Allister Deacon, round out the quirky cast of characters.

This is a series that never fails to amuse or inspire.  It's a good watch on a rainy day or when you're just needing a laugh.  The whole set is definitely a keeper.",1168560000,22,1076,4.670212765957447

2318358,5,B0009S2SOY,"I so looked forward to watching this show each weekend, and hated to have to miss it for any reason.  Now since buying the entire set I can watch to my hearts content.  This was well worth the price.  I love it.",1168387200,3,211,3.9761904761904763

2318361,5,B0009S2SOY,LOVE THIS BRITCOM.  VERY SUBTLE HUMOR BUT OH SO FUNNY!  I HAVE WATCHED THIS TWICE FROM  BEGINNING TO END.  CHARACTERS ARE FLESHED OUT AND YOU BEGIN  TO FEEL AS IF YOU WERE PART OF THE FAMILY.  I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SON BUT I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN.,1168300800,,280,4.0
2318362,5,B0009S2SOY,"This is truly a series not to be missed.  Rarely does a comedy come along with such gentle sweetness that it touches our hearts forever.  And that is exactly what this series does.  Join Lionel and Jean, who fell deeply in love once upon a time, and accidently rediscover one another 38 years later.  The love and hilarity that follow will make you both laugh and cry.  Follow the rocky love adventures of Judith, Jean's daughter, and her friend Sandy.  And speaking of rocky, don't miss Lionel's hilarious, eccentric father, Rocky and his darling bride, Madge.  There's also Mrs. Bales and her constant weather forecasts in the Channel, Alistair and his flash ways, and Jean's sister-in-law, Penny, and her husband, Stephen, all of whom provide much enjoyment and many delights along the way.  The acting is so well done and the characters so well developed that they will become your friends and your family along this pleasant journey.  This is truly a show that you will want to watch and watch and watch again... as time goes by.

This complete series is contained on eleven discs.  If you buy this set, or season 8 and 9, you won't need the additional DVD entitled, ""You Must Remember This,"" as it is contained in both these sets.  This is a great price for the entire series at one pop.  Also, don't miss the ""Reunion Special"" that was subsequently released.

So once again, if you're looking for a show with plenty of love, laughter, and charm, then this is definetly the one to try.  Go out and get a copy today; you won't regret it.

2318363,5,B0009S2SOY,"This beautiful visit to your British friends, brings you into a world where adults are allowed to stumble, grumble and mumble all day and still be comfortable with themselves and others.  Of course, it is a great love story, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  This ""family"" brings you into their midst and allows you to enjoy their vulnerability to one another and life in general. It's okay to speak your mind and still be loved and respected. You can even be petty at times in their home and you will be understood and ""let off the hook"", eventually.  If you love foibles, you will love these folks.  Slouch on the couch in your comfy clothes and be ready to fit in with Lionel and Jean and the rest of the crew.  Laugh, yes, cry, yes, sigh, yes and even be perturbed at times, but you will love visiting this bunch over, and over, and over again.  I am in love with this series and have watched it multiple times on PBS on  Britcom night. I have and will continue to visit these friends numberous times now that I have the complete series and the Reunion.

2318376,5,B0009S2SOY,"This is a great British sitcom about an older couple who fell in love while they were young, but lost touch because of a lost letter.  The main characters are wonderful.  I bought this for my wife because it is one of her favorite TV show and she in turn has gotten my children watching it.  We let my parents borrow it and now they are hooked, too.  The scripts are well written and the actors have a wonderful chemistry.  I highly recommend it.",1141776000,10,446,4.261904761904762
2318377,4,B0009S2SOY,"A touching series; never in bad taste, often funny, and often true to life.  Such fare is hard to find.  The emotions evoked by the poignant theme song are played out by the two once young lovers, separated by mischance during the Korean War.  They find each other again after a lifetime apart.  The only problems with this fine series are the near ubiquity of gratuitous argument [which is less harrowing than that on FAWLTY TOWERS, but also less funny], and Jean's habit in the later episodes of pointless, compulsive lying.  Excise these irritants [which probably represent lazy writers' padding] and we might have 5 stars.",1141084800,18,626,4.867924528301887

2318381,5,B0009S2SOY,"I got hooked on As Time Goes By when it aired on PBS. Buying the DVD's was a no brainer. It is a witty comedy that only the British can produce. It is a series with soul, that not only tells a story, but illustrates the human condition and the unusal ways in which life plays out. If you are a British comedy lover then this DVD set will be a wonderful addition to your collection. Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer are a wonderful pair and the supporting cast are equally delightful.  A light hearted, but not light on substance, series that you will never get bored of watching.",1140048000,10,577,4.293577981651376

Find and buy Harry Nilssons' L.P. (actually a c.d, availiable at Amazon.com)recording of the same name,(As Time Goes By) and you will have the most wonderful ""soundtrack"" music to the series. These together will complete the romantic in all of us.",1138320000,6,458,4.7375

I would rather refer to it as a humerous look at real life.  I cannot wait till I can afford the set.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes comedy and British humor.  I also recommend it to anyone who is looking for good clean family viewing.,1137974400,7,383,4.053333333333334

Now we no longer have to wait until Saturday night to have a Truly Funfilled Family Night.  This series as you can see is for anyone from age 81 down to 9 years.

2318390,5,B0009S2SOY,"We could have purchased each of the seasons of ""As Time Goes By"" separately, but my husband and I waited until this complete collection was available so that we could have the entire set in one neat box.  We've been watching the episodes from the beginning -- enjoying those we've seen before and discovering the ones we'd missed along the way -- and it has become a special part of our evenings together as we watch 2 or 3 at a time.  It's so nice to have them on DVD to watch at our convenience.  Public television plays them fairly regularly, but often at a time when we're not free to sit still and view the program.

Of course, we love this series.  Even though we're younger than Jean and Lionel, we see ourselves in them.  It's such refreshing writing for a comedy series as it finds something amusing in our human interactions as opposed to inventing impossible situations for the sake of a laugh, relying on bathroom jokes, or resorting to insults.",1130025600,234,957,4.502890173410405
