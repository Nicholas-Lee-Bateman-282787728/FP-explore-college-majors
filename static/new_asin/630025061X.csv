7807570,5,630025061X,This is great video material on the Kennedy presidency.  I purchased this tape to replace a copy that I bought in a store some twenty-five years ago.  My old copy was recently damaged by a VCR that is no longer working properly.  This copy was purchased for only a fraction of what I paid for the original.  This tape arrived extremely quickly and in perfect condition.  I was completely satisfied with the seller and the product.,1409961600,,430,4.605263157894737

At the end, there is a interview of JFK's mother it's interesting.
So I suggest you to buy it.",1060905600,,242,4.0625
