8335220,4,B001Q94TJ2,"Mulan came out towards the end of Disneys peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack; thats no insult given how strong most of the films were. This is a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films.

Mulan, voiced by Ming-Na Wen, cant seem to act as a proper Chinese lady and find a husband. She decides to take her physically ailing fathers place when every family must give a man for war that has come upon them by the Huns. Dressing and acting like a man shes awkward in the training at first, but she eventually becomes one of the most impressive of all the soldiers, while the man leading her and the squad is one she admires and finds quite dashing as well. Along the way she gets some much needed help from a small but determined dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.

The film has a nice combination of comedy and action, although they are within a story somewhat clunky at times. This is no doubt a gorgeous film, from ancient Chinese villages to snowy mountain peaks to the Forbidden City. The title character is certainly a strong willed female hero, and mostly it is not by chance but by the choices she makes which determines her fate. Unfortunately she just didn't engage me as a person like any number of other Disney leading ladies; as much as I admired her strength her character basically swung in two modes: awkward bumbling girl and super-brave hero woman. Its a good Disney heroine, but not a great one. The songs are nice, with a couple being fairly memorable.

On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn't one of the best Disney animated musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale. One last thought: What the heck were they thinking with that first song in the ending credits? It doesnt fit movie at all.",1406851200,,2207,4.498753117206983
8335221,5,B001Q94TJ2,"Couldn't find this at any of the local retail outlets and needed to replace an old, worn out VHS.  Excellent movie for the entire family, account handled quickly and shipped in excellent condition and on time.",1403136000,,209,4.805555555555555
