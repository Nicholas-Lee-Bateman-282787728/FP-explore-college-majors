8437162,5,B004ODLUKS,"Coffee samurai is a fun anime. It's about a samurai who was defeated in battle and wishes to come back with an iron body so he can't be killed before he finishes destroying evil. He gets his wish, but as the old saying goes becareful what you wish for - he comes back as a coffee vending machine. He can only return to his human form for a few hours. One of his enemies comes back as a zebra shaped kids ride. It's really worth watching.",1402012800,,437,4.093023255813954
