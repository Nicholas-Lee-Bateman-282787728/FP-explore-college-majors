4082458,4,B0037VF4CI,"Just a note... This review is for anyone else like myself who prefers killer music and performance without the un-necessary profanity. Being a big Alter Bridge fan, I am in the market for a copy of this blu-ray/dvd/cd. When I came to purchase, I noticed the ""Explicit Lyrics"" label. Before buying, I wanted to know why this is on here. After searching for hours on the net with no results, I finally decided to bite the bullet and watch every track on YouTube where someone had uploaded them. So finally there will be an explanation on the net for others like myself. Here is what I found: Myles (the lead vocal) drops the F-bomb in the middle of 2 separate tracks - ""Before Tomorrow Comes"" and ""Buried Alive"". ""Buried Alive"" is one of my favorite AB tracks, so IMHO it was a shame to have my listening experience suddenly ruined by this un-necessary additional lyric. Other than the above, the blu-ray/dvd/cd is phenomenal. AB delivers outstanding live music, once again. Mark Tremonti, once again, does not disappoint with his killer guitar talent. I don't think I need to say anything more about how great the music is for anyone who is an AB fan. Overall, I give it a 9/10. As I said, I am a huge fan of AB, so the only reason for the reduced rating is the un-necessary profanity. I will probably still purchase this blu-ray/dvd/cd. I hope my review helps out someone else like myself.",1296691200,2,1389,4.582329317269076
4082459,5,B0037VF4CI,"This bluray has helped me make a few new Alter Bridge fans, something I can give others (or the cd of the concert in lieu of a greatest hits album) to get a taste for the talent these guys have. My favorite band, easily. Myles Kennedy is the best rock vocal in play right now.",1296172800,2,276,4.036363636363636

WHAT CAN I SAY...AWESOME.IF YOU OWN A BLU RAY, AND YOU HAVE YET TO PURCHASE THIS, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR...PURCHASE,VIEW. YOU WONT BE SORRY. YOU ARE NOW AN ALTER BRIDGE FAN...A DVD YOU WILL WATCH OVER AND OVER .....",1306022400,,401,5.0
4082469,5,B0037VF4CI,This video gave me a new appreciation for Alter Bridge.  Les Miles has a powerful voice that blends perfectly with Mark Tremonti's crushing guitar riffs and the band has a tremendous stage presence that is fun to watch.  The sound production is outstanding and I long to see this band live for myself.,1302652800,,301,4.660377358490566
4082470,5,B0037VF4CI,"I've been waiting 10 months for this Blue-ray to come out and it was well worth the wait. Lot's of energy,perfect vocals and harmonies,great picture and sound for a Blu-ray! All of the songs are great and the crowd is really into the concert. Another Two Thumbs up concert!!",1299628800,,274,4.612244897959184
4082471,4,B0037VF4CI,I love this band and this show. Low end (bass and kick drum) sound great but no matter how I EQ it the guitar levels are low. The guitars need mixed better and the cymbals tones need cleaned up other wise it would be a 5 star. It's a live show. It's not going to sound like a studio album. So buy this Blu-ray and crank it as loud as you can!,1299369600,,342,3.763888888888889
4082472,5,B0037VF4CI,"I first saw Myles Kennedy in Seattle during the Slash tour, guy has an amazing voice, and can play the guitar pretty damn good too. Bought the Alter Bridge Blu-Ray and would just like to say that it was awesome. They as a band are super tight and put on a tremendous show, the combo of Kennedy and Tremonti is great. If they ever make it up to Canada I will be the first in line, as there new biggest follower.",1299283200,,410,4.074074074074074
4082473,5,B0037VF4CI,"The product itself was flawless. Perfect conditions. Very satisfied; however, the real satisfaction comes when watching it. Not because of the quality. It's Blu Ray after all. Anyone who is into rock should give Alter Bridge a chance. They are such an amazing band, yet not many people know about them. They are the members of Creed, with the exception of Scott Stapp. I like Creed, but Alter Bridge is where Mark Tremonti, Brian Marshall, and Scott Philips shine. Those three, plus vocalist Myles Kennedy, form a perfect family. Myles Kennedy is an Amazing singer to say the least; it's no surprise he is currently touring with Slash. Alter Bridge's albums, One Day Remains, Blackbird and ABIII are all worth rock fans' attention. Their songs are meaningful and powerful, down to the lyrics and instruments, and truly define what Rock should be. Live From Amsterdam is a breath-taking concert, even to those who have never heard Alter Bridge before. This band has so much to offer and shows it through their live performances. Vocalist Myles Kennedy does an outstanding job in making the audience a part of the songs, which further amplifies the exciting experience when performing live. But don't take my word for it. See for yourself. Any AB fans out there should definitely own this recorded concert, DVD or Blu Ray, and to those of you who are not, order Live From Amsterdam. Alter Bridge will Not let you down.",1298937600,,1416,4.855371900826446
4082474,5,B0037VF4CI,"I patiently waited for the Blu-ray version of this product so we could listen to Alter Bridge as they were intended to be heard live in concert. I never actually watched the DVD version for myself, but any signs of compression on that version (in either the video or audio department) would have automatically been a hindrance on the overall experience. I got the Blu-ray version on day one and have given it plenty of run-throughs for my final assessment of it. I own an HDTV and a 5.1 surround setup so I was able to maximize its capabilities.

First of all, the concert itself. One great thing about Alter Bridge is they have the talent to perform on stage exactly as they sound with their studio-produced albums, no small feat and something that is rarely seen these days. These four members are TALENTED musicians, no matter which way you look at it. However, they are also able to transform their studio quality sound and make it worthy of a live experience. They have some very nice lead-ins and intros, breakaways during song to rile up the crowd, Myles Kennedy going from one end to the other on stage with vivacity and throwing in fillers between lines, and meanwhile nailing every high-pitched note and solo shred. But don't take my word for it, go onto YouTube and preview a few of these songs for yourself if you'd like. I recommend you help them out and buy the Blu-ray anyway. If you are an Alter Bridge fan, you will be a fan of this concert. Now for my downsides with the concert experience. On a song like Open Your Eyes, one thing that really helps with its alternative feel is the tempo of the song. This is lost in concert as they nearly go double time on it. And speaking of tempo, what is with a crowd always going faster than the beat it's trying to match with? If they can't clap on beat, they shouldn't clap. Finally, I just wish they performed Down To My Last live. It's such an enriching, engaging song and surely beats some of their other tracks in my opinion. I know they did this well before their third album came out so I can't blame them for not including those, but here's to hoping another Blu-ray concert comes out someday including some of those songs.

Now for you videophiles out there, here are some comments on the picture quality. As far as in-house production, I think they did a fine job. There doesn't seem to be much filtering and even some film grain is present. If Myles lets out a bit of spit as he angelically sings into the mic, you can see it clearly. Edges can get muddled, but the colors that separate bluish background hues with the orange flesh tones as lights beam on the band members is nice and vivid. Some of the blacks often seem to crush, but we might have to attribute that to poor low light performance on the cameras. Speaking of camera work, this is where I think many people will think they aren't getting the best possible Blu-ray experience. There are some cameras that give everyone the cleanest possible look, and then there others which make it look like an SD production. This has nothing to do with the video transfer; there are certain cameras which are worse than most of the main ones (like the one behind Scott Phillips leaves a very undesirable look). Again, nothing that can be done there. You're still getting the best possible video experience you'll ever be able to get on this Blu-ray.

Now onto the sound department. If you have 5.1, you owe it to yourself to blast away with it. The center sound stage mostly has Myles' voice directly into the mic and Scott Phillips' drum components (minus the LFE's with the bass pedal). The fronts do the most work getting Myles on reverb, the main guitar portions (seemingly balanced with both guitars and the bass), the midrange portions of the drums and small bits of the crowd. The surrounds mostly boast the crowd's effects, so when they get into it, surely you get a nice live ambiance thrown into the mix; there is also slight vocal reverb and you can hear the high hat take hits on it. The subwoofer handles anything low-frequency-based with the bass guitar and the drums. My crossover frequency is set to the THX-certified 80 Hz, and sometimes I feel like there isn't enough bass whereas sometimes I feel like there is too much. This is but one inconsistency that I'm sure, again, happened with fault to the microphones and not necessarily with the transfer. The sound itself is NICE! My favorite performance to listen to is Watch Over You as Myles stands alone and his acoustic guitar takes over the front sound stage. It's so clean and crisp, you'd think he's actually in the room with you! I think the balance is actually very good, but distorted guitars seem to override clean guitars and I would honestly leave most of the bass guitar in the LFE's rather than hanging around in the fronts. I also wish the center got a little more of a workout in the balance of things, but you can still hear the drums plenty and it doesn't hinder the experience itself. There was only one issue with actual vocal distortion that will make you think you blew an amp component, and it's during the intro of Metalingus when Myles says ""Brian Marhshall on the bass guitar!"" It doesn't ever happen after that, so don't be too worried when you hear it as it's just on the disc. Again, blast this baby for full effect. They did it right!

Now for the disc... honestly, when I first popped it in I thought it was a DVD. The loading screens and menus are very standard definition-esque and even the loading times to transition from area to area on the menu is a travesty. Make sure you switch it to 5.1 because it's not defaulted to it. And I know this were many interludes in this concert which they decided to skip over, but it would have been nice if this  cconcert was actually in order. There's something about it that makes me feel like between the first and last song, they really jumped around the concert in whatever order they chose to. The scenes are broken up by the songs themselves and if you skip them while playing the concert, there isn't any indication of what the song is until you hear it for yourself. I have yet to delve into the behind the scenes stuff of this disc, but there seems to be a good chunk of it to still check out.

If Alter Bridge runs in your play cycles on your MP3 player, you owe it to yourself to get this disc. I can't comment for the DVD, but the Blu-ray is every AB fan's dream. Again, as far as the concert it's too bad they didn't perform Down To My Last and there's no way we could get any of their newest tracks, but this will be the best you will ever see and hear them in your Blu-ray player until [hopefully] their next BD concert comes out. And with that, it very much so earns its five stars!

Parental Advisory: I believe Myles throws in two F-bombs during the concert. Once is during Before Tomorrow Comes, and I can't remember the other time he does it. I believe it's also somewhere in the beginning. It's too bad he couldn't just keep it clean, but if there aren't kids around for it you're fine.",1297209600,8,7068,4.449074074074074
8390816,5,B0037VF4CI,"Loved it!! I just wish this band would open the window a little more on their behind the scenes footage of studio recording. Let the fans see the actual gear being used and the methods applied. This fan base needs more than just the opportunity to ""raise the arm' or "" sing along"" this fan base is more engaged than typically realized.",1491091200,,335,4.419354838709677

8390819,5,B0037VF4CI,"Great concert. These guys pound it, as you know if you are reading this. I have their concert from Wembley and this one, in my opinion is far superior. Better and more camera angles (I've not looked to see if the production companies were the same)... SUPERB. I grew up when concert tickets were $12 for the floor and if you paid a scalper $20 (unheard of) you'd be in the first 5 rows. That said, paying HUNDREDS of dollars for show tickets is just something I refuse to do. I'll pay for a disk like this that I can watch over and over and enjoy multiple viewing angles. If you are a fan, buy this Blu-ray disk. You'll enjoy it, guaranteed.",1454976000,4,641,4.262295081967213
