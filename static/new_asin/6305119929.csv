7884034,5,6305119929,"This movie is absolutely hilarious! It's a great Christmas story for kids of all ages. It probably wasn't meant to be funny, but we were laughing so hard tears were streaming out of our eyes, we could barely breathe, and had to rewind the show because we couldn't hear any of the dialogue over the sounds of our own laughter. We had so much fun with this movie, and will absolutely have to add this to our list of our favorite Christmas movies. Wish it came on DVD, though.",1464307200,,473,4.325842696629214

7884036,5,6305119929,"I enjoyed watching this Christmas special when I was a child and I was pleased to find it available on video. As the title suggests, it tells the story of Santa Claus, a toymaker who, with the help of Mrs. Claus and the Elves, builds a castle so toys can be made and given to all the children. It is a heartwarming and fun special to watch that is appropriate for everyone, and I highly recommend it.",1410134400,,400,4.207792207792208
