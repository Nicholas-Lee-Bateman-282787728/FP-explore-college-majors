2693163,5,B00004S9VQ,"I don't know what would be expected from a DVD of this nature. DTS? 5.1? THX LUCAS sound effects?  Whatever notions you may have in your head, get rid of them.  This is Black Flag.  It sounded just like this at shows, at least it did when I was growing up and catching them live.  You're just going to have to deal with things not sounding pristine, difficulties with imbalances in levels, etc.  All in all, it sounds fine, images are fine, and it's Black Flag in their glory, captured at a time that will never again be captured.  This is the true stuff people and if you have even a slight appreciation of the band, you should not hesitate to get it.  I truly can't recommend this highly enough.",1108080000,15,697,4.315384615384615
2693164,3,B00004S9VQ,"I'm giving this DVD 3 stars when anything that comes from Black Flag should have 5. And those 3 stars are for video alone. Audio only gets one star. I have to agree with the guy from Sweden - the sound is glaringly sub-par and unforgivable. I got my copy at Fry's, and as I was standing there at the rack, looking at the cover and pondering whether I should drop $20 on what I knew was a glorified bootleg, I had only to remember the time I passed up getting it for $20 on video 10 years ago and missing out when I came back for it and it was gone. Any true fan should have this. That being said, here are some obsevations on various elements in the video:
THE LINEUP: This is the ""Live '84"" band lineup as is the setlist on this DVD performance. The Bill/Kira rhythm section, though not being as fierce and brilliant as the Biscuits/Dukowski/Cadena (see 84 demos bootleg) lineup, is more than adequate, even though when you see bill and kira live, they are not as energetic and animated as henry and greg, but this is really splitting hairs and and i know this.
VIDEO EDITING AND QUALITY: This is the best thing about this DVD. It's obvious that they had about 3 or 4 cameras, at least two or three on the stage and behind the drum riser, and all panning, and zooming in and out, never dwelling on one member too much. The editing was also fabulous from the standpoint that someone took the time to incorporate all the camera angles into a flowing whole complete with fades, cuts, cross fades, etc. I do have a bone to pick with the guy who edited some of the in between song stuff. Not cool. He even edited out the first half of bill and kira's classic intro to slip it in! NOT COOL. As for image quality goes, its about as good as a bootleg gets. The color hues are not really that great, but keep in mind *when* this was done...But the images are crisp and clear and decently lighted, so you can really see what's going on. Anybody who's ever seen a 20th generation bootleg filmed with one camera from the balcony can appreciate the fact that this is higher quality effort.
SOUND: The good news - it's Black Flag, and all BF sounds good. Also, every thing *is* audible if your ears can tell the difference between instruments, and the general volume level is adequate, if not somewhat subdued. The bad news - overall sound sucks. If you listen to this on a 5.1 system, only the front right speaker plays, and when I tried watching it through TV channel 3, it only came through the front center speaker. Also, as many here have mentioned, Henry's volume is jacked way over a everything else in the band. Gregs guitar and Bills drums are quite audible though, but kira's bass needs to be twice as loud, but you *can* hear it. All I can say is that if the producers of this DVD are going to ask the same price for this product as a Pink Floyd concert, they should at least get in there and level things out and get the sound to go through all channels. Come on ""Visionary"", its the digital age and sound engineering isn't exactly rocket science.
THE VERDICT: All black flag fans should have this. Especially if you haven't seem them 5 times like i have. You are not paying for a state of the art DVD. You are paying for an imported English bootleg video that is low on production quality, but a more than adequate document of a legendary band in the midst of a fine performance.",1086480000,20,3379,4.314465408805032
2693165,4,B00004S9VQ,MY BLACK FLAG VIDEO IS PERFECT I DONT KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOURS BUT I GUESS I GOT ONE OF THE GOOD ONES NOT THOSE DEFECTIVE ONES THAT YOU OTHER PEOPLE GOT,1062028800,7,151,3.75
2693166,3,B00004S9VQ,"this video does not have all of the songs from ""my war"" as was mentioned earlier. its about 40% my war, 40% slip it in, and 20% old stuff.  its ok... not really the best show they did, but its somewhat funny.  it would be alot better if their rodie (possibly mugger?) wasn't doing god aful backup vocals in the background during most of it (espically the girly ""slip it in""s
the best part is when hank hits the guy in the face with the mic at the end of six pack... if you like that then get it, if not, then why are you reading this?",1062028800,,534,3.9813084112149535
2693167,5,B00004S9VQ,"If you are a true Black Flag fan this is what you have always been waiting for. I have a few old videos of the flag, but the quality on them is getting worse as they get older. A must buy for anyone who rocked with Dez, Biscuits, Duckowski, Ginn, and Rollins in the eighties!",1042934400,3,275,4.0181818181818185
2693168,1,B00004S9VQ,"Maybe the most God-Awfull Video to DVD Transfer I've ever seen.
While the video quality may be terrible, it's great compared to the sound. The sound is so bad, you cant watch this all the way through.
You cant hear the instruments at all!!!! All you hear is Vocals, literally!!!
What should have been an incredible document of a pioneering Punk band turns out to be a collossil mess.
At least we still have the music.",1041292800,9,417,4.5
2693169,3,B00004S9VQ,"If this is the ""My War"" video circa 1984, it ain't that great.  It was filmed in England somewhere, and the Brits just don't get into it.  The audio (isnt great) and the film quality has a lot to be desired.  They play every song off the album, but the band seems to want to get the whole thing over with and get the hell out of England.  If you're a Black Flag fan it's ok, otherwise turn the volume up, and leave the room.",1031875200,,424,3.9529411764705884
2693170,5,B00004S9VQ,"Well I haven't seen this video yet but I just read that if I write a review for this video I can win 50 bucks. That's it. It's probably good, especially if the setlist is punk hardcore and not the late metal crap.",987120000,,213,3.9767441860465116
8157773,5,B00004S9VQ,This video is great.  Its funny at one point where the audience is watching them- just stunned.  I was glad to have found this!,1522800000,,127,4.25
8157774,5,B00004S9VQ,"I read some laughable reviews on this video, so I had to post this. Complaints about the sound quality are ridiculous. Is the sound great? Nope, but it was recorded in 1984. And it's a punk band, perhaps one of the greatest of all time and we're lucky to have this recording in the first place. Complaining about the sound is as stupid as complaining about the picture quality. Why isn't this video from 1984 in HD? Haha. Cmon people, appreciate this for what it is and feel lucky that someone even recorded it in the first place. Punk was great, too bad almost all of you missed it.",1500163200,,583,4.3577981651376145
8157775,5,B00004S9VQ,"This joint is the soundtrack to my life, kids!!!!

Great sound & great picture quality!!

Only beef; they cut out tracks from the actual FULL show...(see link for full show: [...])

Those that are non-Hank BF fans need to reckgnize! THIS is BF at their best stage!!

And that straight from a cat who has had a nervous breakdown, needs head fixing, drinks black coffee, and is a man on a string.

BUY THIS!!

This is hardcore at it's finest hour!",1344124800,,445,4.432098765432099
8157776,4,B00004S9VQ,"This dvd gets a bad rep, and I honestly don't see why, The picture quality is extremely good for an 80s punk show, Remember folks this was a Black Flag show not a Pink Floyd show, So anytime you go to watch a punk rock show on dvd that was from the 80s you cant really expect perfect picture quality, But the picture quality on this dvd is not bad at all, Its actually quite good, And the sound isn't bad either, Sure Henry Rollins vocals out power the instruments but I would rather have vocals out power the instruments instead of the other way around, Even though the vocals out power the instruments a lil bit you can still tell exactly what songs they are playing and hear them well, If you are looking to buy this dvd don't listen to all of the negative reviews, Buy it, Its a great performance by the mighty Black Flag so what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a true Black Flag fan do yourself a favor and buy this.",1205884800,,931,4.177777777777778

8157778,4,B00004S9VQ,"1984, the Flag captured by the Visionary Video team at the Bierkeller in Blackpool. One and only officially released video of this legendary californian HC band, and as such, a must have for all of their fans !! A short ( 55 ')but intense and frantic set of 14 songs with HRollins in maniacal mood. Superbly well shot with 3 cameras and creatively edited, you get to see a lot of everything all the time, with an emphasis on, of course, Hank. This is a tough one to review though so I'll split it into :

1- Video : It's a clean but direct transfer of the VHS that you can still obtain from the label. Resolution is OK only, not very sharp but picture is fine albeit colour is a little faded, just adjust your TV control. It has some very minor and sporadic video glitches like lines and dropouts that really don't detract from the excitment.

2- Audio : Almost an afterthought on this dvd, I'm afraid. 2.0 but you only get VERY low audio from the left channel only; the right one is dead. I had to switch the setup to mono, which spread the audio across both frontal speakers in dual-mono mode, crank the sub, set treble control to the max to get semi-decent sound and still the voice was excruciatingly high in the mix (soundboard ). If only the guitar were louder in the mix I would be in seventh heaven. The drums sound spot-on and the drumming is outright INSANE.

But.....the show is smashing, Hank interacting with the brit crowd is priceless and the overall result is a document I just had to own in spite of having read about all of these flaws BEFORE I bought the dvd.

If you love this band, you HAVE to get this, believe me. Just don't get turned down by the bad reviews. If you love BF, chances are you'll love this video as much as I do.",1172707200,,1751,4.280966767371601
8157779,4,B00004S9VQ,I have never before seen a live dvd of Black Flag live. I must say even though the camera work is very improvised and new wave looking the director got the right shots. If I correct it is the only live dvd of the Flag ever. It is great watching Henry Rollins singing like a crazy person. I would recommend it for any serious fans of the Flag. If you are new to the Flag you might not like this dvd. To really injoy it you must know the histroy of the Flag. SO YOU SECENE KIDS BETTER STAY AWAY!!!,1141171200,,495,3.96
8157780,5,B00004S9VQ,"This is a 1983 video containing some of Black Flag's best songs performed live at Target Studios, including songs sung by both Dez Cadena and Henry Rollins.

The video includes an interview with the band, and they perform songs such as T.V. Party, Rise Above, Damages, American Waste, Thirsty and Miserable, and more classic songs from the early 80's. Also included is a trailer of other Target Video offerings.",1132531200,,411,4.956521739130435
8157781,4,B00004S9VQ,this is a great documentation of black flag in the 84' line-up.  only downer is it seems they recorded the sound from the mixing board - meaning the vocals are jacked over the instruments which were probably much more evened with the vox in the live performance.,1130630400,,262,4.574468085106383
8157782,1,B00004S9VQ,"sorry to say,but BLACK FLAG sucked after DAMAGED(and that didn't suck ONLY because a lot of the material on it had been around for a while BEFORE henry rollins joined).

rollins thought himself a rock star even back in 1984.
