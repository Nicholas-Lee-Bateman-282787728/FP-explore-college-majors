3756068,5,B001PPLJJU,"We first saw this episode when it was on PBS.  My 3-year old twins love it.  They want to watch the pirate segment over and over.  They like to sing along with the songs.

They also like Abbie's Words song, the Stand and Sit song, the Crabby Crawl, among other things.",1245974400,,268,4.196078431372549
3756069,5,B001PPLJJU,"This is a ""must"" DVD for Elmo lovers! Using this DVD is another way of exposing small children to the magic and beauty of books. My grandson, the ultimate Elmo fan, loves all the characters from Sesame Street, but Elmo is his favorite. Watching this DVD, reading Elmo books, along with many other books is a fun way for young children to be entertained as they are learning many important lessons! Also, as a bonus, I was able to purchase two other Sesame Street DVD's at a great price. However, just realize that although DVD's are fun for children, there is no replacement for parents reading to their young children.",1245715200,,619,4.636363636363637
3756070,5,B001PPLJJU,I love this episode as does my two year old son. He thinks the pirate songs are fun and this is another well made Sesame Street Video of the episode that ran on PBS.  If you are looking for an all ELMO storyline- this is not it.  Just a really good episode of Sesame Street that was put on DVD. We love it at our house and sing along with all the songs!,1244332800,2,353,3.8219178082191783
3756071,3,B001PPLJJU,My son loves Elmo in Grouchland so I thought that this would be a great second option for him but it just isn't as good as Grouchland.  Grouchland has a continuous story to it  and this has mini stories (like Elmo loves you).  This is more like Sesame Street instead of a movie.  My son likes the Sesame Street characters so he will pay attention to it but it is just okay.,1242518400,3,373,4.138888888888889
3756072,3,B001PPLJJU,"I thought this would be a great DVD with pirates and singing, but it's a lot of on screen reading and my 3 year old gets bored. Tina Fey is entertaining, but kids don't see her as anyone different from the rest of the adults on the movie. The clay pirate short is cute, but for the first 15 minutes, the movie is mostly talking which doesn't capture my child's interest. The giant squid is a cartoon and is only on for a minute or so. I would think this would be better for 5 year olds.",1241222400,8,486,4.020618556701031

8334235,4,B001PPLJJU,"My grandson is addicted to this DVD; we've had it out of the library repeatedly, and he always asks for it when we've just taken it back. He will watch it every day if he can. I'm buying him his own copy!",1390608000,,204,3.880952380952381
8334236,5,B001PPLJJU,"I am the parent of a Two year old ELMO-holic... originally introduced to Elmo at daycare, we now have an extensive DVD collection of this little red monster.
This particular DVD is highly requested by my son.  It features Tina Fey and has some cute segments... I find it is actually tolerable to watch (which is daily).",1323129600,,319,4.5964912280701755
8334237,5,B001PPLJJU,"I am glad that Amazon has DVD's that are affordable.  The stores don't carry these titles anymore and all the new movies are over $20.  Amazon has a good selection on DVD's for my daughter.

Thank you.",1292198400,,201,4.378378378378378
8334238,5,B001PPLJJU,"Tina Fey is great - and Elmo is always good.  The grandkids, 19 month old twins, love it.  Jim Henson's goal with Sesame Street was to keep the parents interested and amused so they would watch with their children.  Jim may be gone, but that essence still remains!",1282262400,,264,4.458333333333333
8334239,4,B001PPLJJU,Very cute songs and skits about books and reading.  My 2yr old loves it.  She sings along & reads more because of this video.,1253145600,,125,4.166666666666667
