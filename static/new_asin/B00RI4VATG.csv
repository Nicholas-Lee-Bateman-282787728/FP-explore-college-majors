8695365,4,B00RI4VATG,"This 2014 Swedish film presents the melancholy prospect of observing two men, Andreas, whose latent bisexuality is veering towards more homosexual attraction to men, at least to tranny Sebastian (a.k.a. ""Ellie""), while Sebastian/Ellie him/herself gradually is drifting, over the summer's and early autumn's span of time, into increasingly greater assertion of a female identity (at least, more or less, queerly so). As their trajectories of sexual identity and desire meet, cross, and render asunder, one observes the desperation of Andreas to hold onto Ellie, while Sebastian/Ellie becomes ever more strongly, more defiantly and surely self-feminised.

The result is a break that Andreas does not want, but which Ellie needs to plunge fully into his/her new identity. Along the way, Ellie pries into Andreas' life and friendships, causing some strain which only furthers the lovers' alienation one from the other (not to mention, but it gets mention here anyway, embarrassment and difficulties for Andreas). There are some pleasant scenes of Sebastian and Andreas cavorting sexually, with some discreet full-frontal nudity, in various settings, urban/domestic, parklands, and nature.

The edition viewed, Network Releasing 7954293, is one obtained from Amazon-U.K., the DVD being in the PAL format. (There is a North American DVD edition available, formatted NTSC, as well, with similar features.). English subtitles are embedded, well displayed but not so prominently on the screen as to be unduly distracting, with the dialogue being in Swedish. The film is rather slow moving, so it is not hard to stay apace with the dialogue via the subtitles. The only extra features are pretty minimal, namely, a trailer and a gallery of images.

Well filmed and enjoyable in a low-key, languorously elegiac sort of way.",1452729600,,1811,5.460714285714285
