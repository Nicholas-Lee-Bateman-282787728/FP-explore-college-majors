7856736,5,6303703496,"OMG! I remembered this performance from the late 80's going into the early 90's....  It was FUNNY AS HELL back then & it's STILL FUNNY AS HELL now!!!!  Tommy Davidson is an excellent comic, and he developed his skills from way back in the days of In Living Color----and he can still represent in today's style of comedy. Some of these ""new comics"" might want to go back and study some of the 80's & 90's comics and LEARN HOW TO DO THIS CRAFT called comedy....",1405814400,,459,4.325581395348837
7856737,4,6303703496,"I like this, but I thought that this would be the entire show. This was only 30 minutes - there was another much longer version, but I can't find it.",1354579200,,149,4.0
7856738,3,6303703496,"I had trouble finding this video. I finally found out the name, ordered it and watched it and realized I needed Illin' in Philly 2, but this still had a lot of the jokes I was looking for. Tommy Davidson was at the top of his back back then.....",1341964800,,245,4.020408163265306
7856739,5,6303703496,"I first saw this show on tv or a cable show and laugh sooo hard I almost choked. I think this was when Tommy Davidson first started out and was at his best then, very talented. All his work since then have been great. When it came on again I taped it. My family and friends saw it and also thought it was hilarious so I had to make some copies. Since then I no longer have a vhs player only a dvd player but, the last time I tried to watch it the volume was very low and friends and family can't find their copy. I wish to god that this was on dvd, I probably would buy it for 25 or 30 dollars if it became available ,but not on vhs. Can you let me know if it does? I would reserve some copies today. Thanks A.D",1283212800,,711,3.778523489932886

7856741,5,6303703496,"This is BY FAR one of if not THE best comedy stand-up's I have ever seen!  My mother, the most Christian woman I know even cracks us at this!  She was the one who showed me!  My sister and I know this DVD by heart and still watch it all the time!  I'm laughing just thinking about the beer jokes! HAAAA HA HA HA HAAAA! LMAO! And Freddy...""Freddy's in da' house...."" Yall know what I'm talkin bout!  If not  Buy the VHS!  They need to put this on DVD ASAP before we warp our VHS!",1236038400,,478,3.968421052631579
7856742,5,6303703496,"I really wish this would come out on DVD.  My poor video is just falling apart.  I have so many ""inside jokes"" from this routine that I scare people with some of the things that come out of my mouth.  I have never laughed so hard in my life!  Tommy Davidson is brilliant and an absolute riot.  If you haven't seen it, you need to.

I thought it was originally longer - thank you for making me realize that I am not going crazy.",1217980800,,427,4.023809523809524
7856743,4,6303703496,"The other reviewers are correct. This is Tommy at his funniest, and if you haven't seen this video, you are sure to get some serious laughs. However, I do remember seeing a longer duration version of this on TV many years ago with some VERY funny material that is missing in this video. For example, his Al Jarreau impression.....HILARIOUS!! But for silly corporate reasons, you won't see it in this video. Paramount / Showtime edited this ""home video"" version down to 30 minutes from what used to be an hour-long TV special....which was also edited down from the actual live show which was about a 90 minutes long! All those funny jokes were left on the cutting room floor. The truth is: they cheaped us out, thinking 30 minutes is enough for the home viewer, because using less tape is more cost effective for Paramount. Guess what - I'd easily pay $50 for the full show! Ironic isn't it? Thumps up for Tommy - one of the funniest stand up comedians EVER! SHAME ON SHOWTIME / PARAMOUNT!!!!!",1184198400,4,992,4.610169491525424
