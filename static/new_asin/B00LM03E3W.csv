8666529,5,B00LM03E3W,"If you're not a Tiger Shroff fab yet,  Then this is a fun introduction to the world of Tigers Shroff,  And a really fun example of bollywood films. You'll sing you'll dance!! I teach  Religions of the world, cultural ethics and the philosophy of man, and I use this film at the end of my Hindu God unit. After learning about 15 or so Hindu gods and watching some documentaries, this film is almost a reward for my students... Of course I give them a questionnaire on what subtle inferences to Hindu religions are seen in the film, but in actuality, I just want them really to enjoy and appreciate the rich culture of India and the fun of Bollywood.",1521244800,,648,4.383333333333334
