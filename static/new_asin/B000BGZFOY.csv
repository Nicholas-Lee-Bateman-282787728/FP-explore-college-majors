Usually, one expects less than nothing from these cheap, public-domain double features. This is an example of a pleasant surprise.

SAVE THE BOX BECAUSE:

Save the box, because that is the only case that comes with this DVD!

HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL:

This is certainly a classic of the genre starring Vincent Price. This version is B/W and Fullscreen, 75 minutes. A 3-star horror classic without gore.

ABOUT THE TRANSFER:

The transfer for the ""House On Haunted Hill"" was not nearly as good as the ""Warner Brothers"", Widescreen, BW release that I last saw this movie on. However, it played in ""Fullframe"" about the way a VHS transfer would, with acceptable sound and video, though a little dark at times. There was no bouncing or flutter or excessive artifacts on the film. One would assume that he/she was watching the movie on cable by the quality of the transfer.

BLUEBEARD:

This very creepy John Carradine horror vehicle is a real sleeper. Basically, it is a ""Boston Strangler""-in-Paris film made 60 years ago. It is a worthwhile film to see, definitely a 3-star film, and again, without the gore or profanity that one finds in more recent offerings from this genre.

ABOUT THE TRANSFER:

Not as good as the first, but the bouncing stopped after the opening credits and some artifacts and fading persisted throughout this 60-year-old film. Still, it was quite watchable.

MECHANICAL MONSTERS:

This original ""Superman Cartoon"" played even better than either of the feature presentations. This is a very good transfer of a nearly 60-year-old cartoon.

BOTTOM LINE:

At around $5.00, it is very well worth the price.",1132099200,2,1633,4.930402930402931
