2653331,5,B000I5YJ7C,"Both the Amina dance routines and advice and Bert Balladine's live class footage are absolutely priceless. The legendary dancers of San Francisco are shown here in live performances, interviews and during  downtown street shows.

This exquisite dance footage is nothing less than a rare window into Belly Dance history. Every dancer should own a copy.",1346371200,,351,5.363636363636363
2653332,5,B000I5YJ7C,"This is worth buying just for the footage of the great Burt Balladine who is shown teaching his legendary classes. What a terrific dancer and teacher! Now I can see why he is still worshiped by so many dancers. Amina, one of San Francisco's great stars appears in an extended live performance at the very heigh of her career. You have never seen Taksim like this--she is spellbinding to say the very least!

I also enjoyed the performances by Katerina and Taia, both of whom were apparently just beginning when this film was made. Each of them went on to build impressive careers. Finally, the hypnotic outdoor street dance by sword dancer Deanne is featured and you can definitely feel the excitement she created in her live performances.

These are the legendary stars of the San Francisco dance scene that sprung up around North Beach. I don't know of another place where you can see such performances.

I loved this film and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about belly dance. Professionals wil especialll enjoy the rare Ballendine and Amina segments, which are unique to this lovely film.",1300060800,5,1104,4.8

2653334,2,B000I5YJ7C,Kinda funny and there were some neat clips but not worth $15 for such a short thing.,1279843200,,84,4.0
2653335,3,B000I5YJ7C,"Interesting trip back through time, but rather over-priced for such a short dvd.  Still, it is worthwhile for fans of old-style American cabaret dance who are not on a budget.",1234137600,,175,4.833333333333333
2653336,4,B000I5YJ7C,"I enjoyed it a lot, but it might not be for everyone.  Obviously a short documentary type movie about the times and Belly Dance - the 70's.  For me it was lovely to see again on film, what I remember from my ""baby dancer"" days.  I remember the street dancers, like DeAnn.  And scouring the little hole-in-the-wall shops for treasures to add to your costume.  I even have LPs of the musician that are playing for the dancers.  I was there.  I lived it too.

Want to step back in time and see Belly Dance history?  This DVD is for you.",1185753600,11,533,4.198019801980198
8144174,4,B000I5YJ7C,"This is an excelent reflection of the 1970's Bellydance scene in the San Francisco area.  The dancer's attitudes, general cosutming direction, performance choices are pretty reflective of the general American Bellydance Scene.  The introduction is somewhat harem fantasy though lovely imagery and highlights how many aspects of the prevalent harem dancer mythos that was popular at the time.  We hear many orientalist and harem fantasy comments throughout such as comparisons to Sheherezad in telling a story.  Much of it comes of as a bit cheesy (but it's pretty common in style for a 70's documentary like this.  It's great for dance historians, ethnographers, and ethnologists who want to see some of the ""classic stars"" from this era such as the legendary Burt Balladine, Amina, Deanne, Taia and Katarina.  By today's standards some of the comments can come off a little odd.  Modern Bellydancers tend to underplay sexual in favor of sensual but here we hear several comments from instructors about being feminine, being sexual, being erotic, etc... Amina's advise almost sounds like a push towards selling yourself, dance for a guy's fantasy, let him festishise and fantasize about you, get up close and personal (like a lap dance?).  While it was very much part of the way bellydance was viewed in that era modern bellydancers may find some of that a little off putting.

Being that there were several topics touched in and so little actual film it felt in some ways like there were a lot of story-lines unfulfilled.  There didn't seem to be a beginning-middle-end to any of the topics.  We hear about putting together costumes and get a begining but the middle and end are somehwat muddled and inconclusive.  The dancer's personal development as a performer is a big beginning and middle point but has a fizzle out at the end with no real resolution.  Seems like many of those points they bring up aren't followed through to completion as if the story they are telling just trails off.

Overall I enjoyed seeing classic American Bellydance and this glimpse into it's history and the culture surrounding it.",1513641600,,2113,5.0
8144175,4,B000I5YJ7C,"This short film is a delightful insight into California's bellydance scene in the 1970s. The cheesy ""recreations"" are part of the charm, but the real jewels are the performances and class footage.",1502150400,2,196,5.15625
8144176,5,B000I5YJ7C,Excellent production. The dancing was excellent but the explanation of putting together the costume and the meaning  of the the jewelry was educational.  I always enjoy learning what goes on behind the scenes.,1476921600,,209,5.303030303030303

8144178,5,B000I5YJ7C,"Love Love Love!  This is San Francisco Belly Dance as it was in the 1970's. I love this Film sooo much I've practically worn it out. I watch it practically every day and DREAM of how it used to be...the good ole days in Belly Dance! When dancers actually got paying jobs and played finger cymbals, and danced to LIVE Music. if You are an aficianado of the Hay Days of USA belly dance You will LOVE this film!  The video of Amina Goodyear is worth it's weight in gold!.....I play this for my students to show them the historical perspective of how much our dance has changed. and so I have another chance to watch it again! Thank You Gordon Inkles! xoxo.",1470182400,2,653,4.300813008130081

8144180,2,B000I5YJ7C,This documentary is very dated and the production quality is very poor.  I guess it would be considered interesting to someone who knows next to nothing about belly dancing.  A belly dance enthusiast would be extremely disappointed.,1468540800,,232,5.243243243243243
8144181,5,B000I5YJ7C,I enjoyed watching this.  It was nice to see familiar faces.,1458864000,,60,4.454545454545454
8144182,5,B000I5YJ7C,"Being a huge admirer of belly dance, I take the time to study it's roots and enjoy vintage footage of what it was like ""back in the day"". I've seen bits-n-pieces of Classic Stars of Bellydance, but never the entire movie until now and it's amazing!! I love the individual stories of tragedy and triumph. Following the dancers' pursuits into what they love!!! This DVD is truly a CLASSIC and a must have!!! It's at the TOP of my collection!! Perhaps a Volume II will appear someday!!!",1413590400,,483,4.563218390804598
