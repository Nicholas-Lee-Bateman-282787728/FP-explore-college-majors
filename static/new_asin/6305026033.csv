7881315,5,6305026033,"I think movies and TV shows pretty much speak for themselves. If you are searching for this movie/show, you must be considering buying it. I purchased this for my electronic library because I did not feel the need to have the media. I am very happy with the fact that I can go to my library from my phone or tablet whenever I want to and watch this. It is also handy to be able to access it on my home theatre system you finish one and then go to the next; it avoids having to run up and down the stairs switching out DVDs .",1392336000,,524,3.952830188679245
