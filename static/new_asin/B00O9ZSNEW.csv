6730591,4,B00O9ZSNEW,"A few years ago I received  and reviewed here on Amazon a double DVD set titled The Transatlantic Sessions. I was one of 6 volumes (each with almost four hours of wonderful performances by both Scottish and American folk performers. The project  bringing US artists like Jerry Douglas, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Alison Krauss and Tim OBrien to Scotland to play and record in a mountain retreat in the Scottish Highlands  was conceived by Ally Bain (Scotlands pre-eminent fiddler and member of the original Boys of the Lough) in 1995 and released on DVD by Bains record label, Whirlie Records. For some reason Whirlie released them all in the PAL format (for Europe) and only issued Volume 4 in the NTSC (US) format. Then they went back and released earlier volumes in NTSC EXCEPT Volumes 1and 3. These were promised last year but  to my knowledge  have not been issued.

The reason for all this background is because PBS HOME VIDEO has just released this single DVD  titled The Directors Cut. Im not sure why it is called that (the Director is Mike Alexander). It is Volume 1 in a series of not-yet-announced volumes. With six volumes on DVD from Whirlie  with almost 24 hours of performances by 179 artists (!), It would take many volumes to complete this series at the current rate.

MOST  if not all - of the performances on this DVD come from Series 4 (recorded in 2009) and all but two of the 12 performances are headlined by American artists (OBrien, Chapin Carpenter, Eric Bibb, Sarah Jarosz, Bela Fleck, James Taylor). The running time is 52 minutes.

So, if this is your type of music, this DVD may be a good introduction to the series. But if you want to dig deeper, I think the Whirlie releases (well the four sets that are on NTSC) will be a better deal. They are pricier but the per performance cost is much cheaper. Still Im glad that  with PBSs participation  the series is getting more exposure.

There is a companion CD to this volume but I haven't heard it yet.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8682863,5,B00O9ZSNEW,Fantastic Folk music with Fantastic musicians. Runaway and Copperline alone are worth the price.,1492646400,,96,5.928571428571429
8682864,5,B00O9ZSNEW,just a great gathering of wonderful singers and musicians the whole Transatlantic Sessions are a great source of music,1486512000,,118,5.2631578947368425
8682865,3,B00O9ZSNEW,"Incredible music and virtuoso-level playing, but beware this is an NTSC (low resolution) video.  The camerawork and production are excellent, but the audio is simple stereo and the video is blurry and pixelated most likely because the native recording format was PAL meaning it's been transcoded to NTSC for American DVD players.",1485561600,2,329,5.326923076923077
8682866,5,B00O9ZSNEW,"I loved it. My whole family loved it. It is to bad the other sessions did not get recorded in
Region 1 type so I could buy more sessions. I did find another session that was made for Region 1` and ordered it. I am looking forward to getting it for Christmas.
By the way I would like to thank Amazon for making it so easy now to get things ordered.",1480723200,,347,3.9014084507042255

8682868,5,B00O9ZSNEW,If you like acoustic music this is for you. Great musicians! Great sound quality. It really is worth every penny,1465516800,,112,4.65
8682869,5,B00O9ZSNEW,This Transatlantic Session Series is some of the very best music of this kind I've ever come across. I can't decide how to label it but it's all very satisfying music and I listen it often. The volume that contains the Amos Lee music is especially rewarding to me but the entire contents of the series are outstanding. There are too many artists to mention them all so if you have an adventurous spirit you should at least try one of the sessions.,1461542400,,447,4.397590361445783
