Its 100 year birthday is celebrated with 4 movie shorts by some of the most varied but respected movie makers of today. They are Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap. Their anthology is not the best of their efforts but an example in brevity of the sort of cinema that they are best at. You may hate all of these shorts, or  like some, but this celebration does have some uniqueness and engages us.
I thought that these films would have an unifying theme but unfortunately I was disappointed,  but despite this weakness and  some other drawbacks they  do leave an impression.
The first short is by Karan Johar called `Ajeeb Dastan Hai Yeh'. Most of us associate him with candy floss however he tries  a completely different genre here. An examination of a lost marriage between Rani Mukherjee and Randeep Hooda tormented by infrequent sex and a lack of communication. An acquaintance  Saqeeb Salim provokes their marriage, There are many many references to Bollywood, from Rani's profession as a gossip columnist, Hooda's love of old film music and Salims test for determining the sexuality of a male based on their  preference between Sridevi and Madhuri. Rani Mukerjee is stunning both in her acting and with her freckles. Hooda and Salim are somehow weak but the street singer with her rendition of Lag Jaa Gale is flawless.  I felt this was an ordinary segment but refreshing to see Johar explore a complex topic.
The next clip by Dibakar Banerjee is outstanding and one of my two favorites, Star by Dibakar Banerjee which is based on Satyajit Ray's short story ""Patol Babu, Film Star"".
Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a failed businessman and a struggling actor who lives in a chawl with his wife and sick daughter. Lack of motivation mars his days and people make jokes about his failed business of selling emu eggs,the Emu itself is a wonderful screen presence. Just remarkable is fact that all the man wants to do is impress his daughter.
It is an ode to the extras who fill up the screen and we never think about them ever as we devour the film. Sadashiv Amrapurkar is amazing and so are the final moments when Siddiqui comes and acts out the days happenings to his sick daughter. Fathers love their daughters with all their heart, the final scenes are proof that Siddiqui is an incredible actor and Banerjee, a director who knows his stuff.
The next segment is by one of my favorite new directors, Zoya Akhtar- Sheila Ki Jawaani. This is a hopeful segment about the fascination the opposite sex can have for cross dressing and putting makeup. I am unsure if Zoya wanted us to just believe in this fixation or is this a view about  repressed sexuality. That apart the boy (Naman Jain) shines brightly along with his stern but loving (Ranvir Shorey), who wants him to participate in sports but all the little one want to dreams of becoming a dancer, and his fantasy is Katrina Kaif. Naman Jain and Khushi Dubey are the brother and his sister, who share a room but also secrets. The sacred brother and sister bond is so beautifully rendered. Watch the last sequence and the brilliant dance sequence by Jain. Once again, Zoya proves a point.  I cannot wait for her next film Dil Dhadakne Do.
The last segment is  a dedication to Amitabh Bachchan is a direct reference and homage to not only Amitabh Bachchan but also to many of his devotees who come to Bombay to pay respects  to the idol and catch a glimpse of the phenomenon. Titled `Murrabba' it stars Vineet Kumar as the son who treks to meet his fathers  wishes. This short is weak but the struggle of people trying to survive in a city is adequate.
The final song featuring some of India's best actors and actresses is mediocre. I would have preferred a more blockbuster tune.
 The film is  fresh and interesting and an tribute to the enduring dream of Indian Cinema.",1400630400,2,3946,4.6575539568345325
8623695,5,B00GJ00ENS,"I have been an American Hindustani/Bollywood movie viewer for thirty years starting with Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali et al, I have never been so fully immersed  with the experience of voyeur/participant as was so cleverly executed in Bombay Talkies. I usually purchase movies, watch them and revisit them at regular intervals, however; after watching Bombay Talkies I was left speechless (in thought) wondering what just happened? The four stories presented were oh so entertaining, at the same time giving intuitive insight into the  director/writer's lives which buffed up the level of intelligence that rose to the viewer's expectations of superb filmmaking. The premier song ""BAMBAY TALKIES"" along with the images presented swept me away. It resonates in my head continually. Unlike all other movies I reserve watching this movie, because it is so fulfilling, for unique and deserved moments of pleasure. FIVE THUMBS UP!!!",1393459200,,929,5.444444444444445
