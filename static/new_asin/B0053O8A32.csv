4535167,5,B0053O8A32,I love American Dad and have all 7 volumes on dvd. this show is so smart and unique that more people should check it out on Fox or on dvd. It's definitely worth getting into. Amazon.com has great prices and pre-order gets me this dvd ultra fast.,1337299200,2,245,4.23404255319149
4535168,1,B0053O8A32,"This season of American Dad! is probably the best one so far. Highlights for me were the 100th episode, Stan's Food Restaurant, the Christmas episode, or The People vs. Martin Sugar. All of these episodes are amazingly funny.

Now here's the big BUT, which has nothing to do with the series itself, but with this product. I have hundreds of DVDs at home, and all of them play on my code free DVD player, yet for some reason this is the first one that won't. (After the menu it shows a screen that says it's not able to play on my DVD player because of the region code.) I have no idea if this is a new 'feature' by 20th Century Fox or something, but in any case it sucks big time. I intentionally spend money to buy my favorite shows on DVD and never ever download them illegally, but if they are now trying to reinforce the region code issue (which never worked and made sense in the first place), I really have to think about that. Sorry for the rant, and I'm also sorry to have to rate this amazing show so badly, but for me this product is worth one star only. I had to watch it on my laptop, which really isn't the way I intended when I bought this.",1335657600,7,1154,4.151785714285714
4535169,1,B0053O8A32,"All I need to say is that we had six great volumes of this show but just like Family Guy it got old and this is the season in which it all started, or should I say ""ended""?",1335657600,2,172,3.5526315789473686
4535170,5,B0053O8A32,"First off, thanks to the Amazon reviewer who went to the trouble of breaking down all the episodes that come with this volume, and reviewing each one independately.  Really raising the bar for the rest of us, I definitely need to start doing better reviews if I ever want to rise up in the Amazon ranks.

Anyway, American Dad was a show that for years I ignored.  I never gave it the time of day, after all I had Family Guy.  Well, Family Guy for me has started to wane in years past and I decided one night to give American Dad a try.  My brother and I laughed ourselves almost to the point of hiccupping.  This show is histerical.  Also this is NOT Family Guy Jr.  This show follows it's own formula and style.  I.E. no cut scenes like Family Guy.

I have pretty much now seen all the older re-runs and now watch the new episodes every Sunday night.

This particular volume contains some especially funny episodes.  One that jumps to mind is the Jury Duty episode with Roger and Stan.  Roger really gets into his characters and his ""Martin Sugar"" persona was a riot.

Judging from what I've seen, American Dad and Family Guy do not releases seasons, but volumes.  I don't know if this means you don't get a complete season or what is the case.  I do know you get quite a few episodes in this set though.

This would be a great gift for a soldier overseas, I doubt those guys have tv over there.  The reality is though that this tv show IS sindicated now and is on at least 3 times a day.  So for me at least, owning it is not high on my list.

However many people can not afford cable, I know I couldn't if I lived on my own, so just buying a series here and there is probably cheaper.

If you are one of these people, give this show a chance.  Especially if you have never seen it before.  It will crack you up.

***One techical aspect you may want to research before buying.  Fox has the bad habit of release different cuts of tv shows.  I have on numerous occasions watched Family Guy and then watched the same episode on Adult Swim and have seen differences.  Usually Fox cuts stuff from their episodes, while Adult Swim will air more explicit content matter.  What do you get on DVD, I honestly don't know...

Well, that's my 2 cents on this great show and this Volume 7 home release, hope it was helpful.  As always, sorry for any spelling and grammer errors, I went to public school...",1334448000,17,2394,4.267260579064588
4535171,5,B0053O8A32,"According to a number of sources including Wikipedia and tvshowsondvd.com, American Dad! Volume 7 has a release date of April 17 and will contain all 19 episodes from Season 6. One big plus is that Volume 6 of American Dad! was the entire 5th season and this set appears to be the entire 6th season. I wish that they would start doing this with Family Guy instead of dividing the episodes up into Volumes.

""Flirting with Disaster""  4/5 (Hilarious spoof of ""The Office"" in the opening scences)
""Gorillas in the Mist"" 3.5/5

This set has some very funny episodes. The Christmas Special ""For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls"" was just fantastic. ""The People vs. Martin Sugar"" had me laughing for days after it aired(Several references to ""The Fugitive""). In the episode ""Flirting With Disaster"", the opening sequence and the first 5-6 minutes of the show is a spoof of ""The Office"" as a documentary crew films Stan and his co-workers in their office. This sequence is an absolute riot. There are quite a few more episodes on this set that I do like: Stanny Boy and Frantastic, School Lies, Home Wrecker, 100 A.D., Stan's Food Resturant among others are all hilarious. So far during the current 2011-2012 season, there hasn't been a really good episode yet so this DVD set could be the last good one unless things improve.",1327795200,35,1816,4.812903225806451

4535500,3,B0053O8A32,"I have all of Family Guy and the first Seven seasons of American Dad. I like the shows but I must say that perhaps both shows are becoming too ADULT. Children watch these shows and I think they are the lucky ones when they do not understand the over the top and gross sex jokes and themes, etc. American Dad has done a lot more than push the envelope, they have more of less shoved it down our collective throats. A. D. even thought it was funny to throw ACID into Francine's face, which melted it of course. Roger became the girlfriend of one of the boys. Roger used a tennis ball with a slit in it which was used as a vagina for the boy. Then there was the episode where the daughter of the show had married her stoner boyfriend. The boyfriend gave up pot and pot had kept him from masturbating. In the episode the stoner masturbated in the cupboard and just basically everywhere.

I like Family Guy and American Dad but the shows are resorting too much to raunchy crude story lines and sex. The shows simply would be a lot BETTER if the raunchiness was toned down about 20%. The writers should focus more on the stories and comedy and leave the pornography to the pornographers. The writers of theses stories are now resorting to showing cartoon penis's. They showed Peter's penis a few times in Family Guy and also the penis of the American Dad. Really, is this supposed to be high art, and great animation?",1341705600,4,1411,4.385496183206107
