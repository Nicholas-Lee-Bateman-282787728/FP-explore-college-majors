8611504,5,B00F1FVL6Q,"One of those episodic films very well done with a fabulous cast traces a panorama of the italians sometimes sad sometimes fun, but always with their unique sense of humor. Catherine Spaak as a fake rich teen, Virna Lisi as a fortune hunter, and above all Anna Magnani's odissey to have an icecream on sunday with her family. Great!",1475625600,,331,4.627118644067797

8611506,3,B00F1FVL6Q,Tris is a most entertaining portrait of Italian culture in the 60's. I first saw this film on TV in my home country and dubbed into Spanish. I wish the DVD transfer had ketp the original language and had added captions in other languages.,1398643200,3,238,4.431818181818182
