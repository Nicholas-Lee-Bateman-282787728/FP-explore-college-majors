6877466,5,B00QQU5P6C,My daughters love this video. They are ages 8 and 9 and enjoy watching the character building lessons that go along with the scripture. It's been a great tool to help them memorize scripture but also to help them understand the meaning of the scripture on their level.,1448668800,2,268,4.604166666666667
6877467,5,B00QQU5P6C,"Amazing! My kids are learning the passages effortlessly, and when I start them out with a verse, their eyes light up. Also, they're understanding them: my daughter told me ""I can fight in battle, even when I'm 5! It's a real battle!"" I was floored!",1421625600,6,248,4.533333333333333
8692352,5,B00QQU5P6C,This video keeps the attention of all 4 of my kids. They really enjoy the different teachers and are glad to learn the Scripture with this fun method.,1533081600,,150,4.392857142857143
8692353,4,B00QQU5P6C,Absolutely LOVE the content! I wish they would make a sequel! The only reason I deducted one stat is because there is no way to play the entire DVD from start to finish. The menus are very annoying because you have to manually select to play each different passage of scripture (and there are like 10or 12 of them). It's annoying to have to go back to the controller every 8 minutes to select the next passage. I wish it could just play them all from beginning to end!,1532649600,,468,4.269662921348314
8692354,4,B00QQU5P6C,"Kids liked it but I was expecting it to be songs with motions, not just speaking with motions.",1529712000,,94,4.277777777777778
8692355,5,B00QQU5P6C,Excellent! My kids really enjoy it and I even enjoy the explanations of the scriptures. Well done!! They really should make more!!,1520208000,,130,4.954545454545454
8692356,5,B00QQU5P6C,My girls were so excited to revive this DVD. It makes scripture memory fun. My 5 year old has learned whole chapters with this program.,1498521600,,135,4.44
8692357,5,B00QQU5P6C,"Very excellent customer service and generosity. Beautifully put together DVD and the teaching applications are so insightful and awesome. You have blessed so many lives with this DVD, please know that. God bless!",1489622400,,212,5.454545454545454
8692358,5,B00QQU5P6C,This DVD is so fun! I am memorizing scripture and my 2 year old has a blast with the hand motions. I order it for all the friends bday party gifts now.,1487548800,,151,3.75
8692359,5,B00QQU5P6C,This has got to be the best purchase I have made in years!  My children learned all the Bible verses in just a couple weeks.  I even find myself meditating on the Word more because of watching this show.,1466812800,,203,4.17948717948718
8692360,5,B00QQU5P6C,We have really been impressed with Scripture Talk video. The kids really learned ALL the verses and understand the meanings. It is one thing to memorize the words but so much important to understand and apply God's Word.  We have seen that with Scripture Talk. The skits really help kids understand and see how the verses apply to daily life. It is educational and entertaining. Wish they had more products.,1449705600,3,407,4.814285714285714
8692361,5,B00QQU5P6C,"This DVD is a wonderful tool for children, parents and teachers.  My children love memorizing and learning with the children in the DVD.  The hand motions all make the verses ""stick"".  I'm confident they have hidden these verses in their hearts, which will be invaluable for their entire lives!
Parents and teachers will benefit from the sections on ""how to teach"".  This can then be applied to any verse they want to share with their children.
This is a fun yet meaningful way to memorize scripture.  Highly recommended.",1449014400,3,521,4.875
