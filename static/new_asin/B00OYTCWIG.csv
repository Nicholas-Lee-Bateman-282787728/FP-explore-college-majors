6777106,2,B00OYTCWIG,"Loads of action and special effects, but a really confusing and outlandish storyline.  The writing was ridiculous.  The Mayans who were so intelligent they became extinct left behind in a cave a energy cell that when used with their designs they left can build a machine that will save the world from the coming apocalypse being brought on by the approach of the ninth planet  (Pluto is no longer a planet, but a dog for Mickey Mouse).  There is suppose to be a disaster for each sign of the zodiac.  All the disasters seem to happen near the hero, his son and a girl the son has a crush on.  Together they race from here to there and then over here, get rescued by a survivalist.  Are chased by a fruitcake fed trying to kill them to get the stone back.  The scenery looks like Washington State or Oregon, but then the find certain tiles are only 8 miles away in Davenport, Iowa.  Just ignore that Tsunami they escaped racing ahead of in the car.  Good only for action fans who don't even care if the plot makes sense.",1421280000,5,1019,4.343915343915344

6777111,1,B00OYTCWIG,"The acting was awful, the effects were awful, they don't even show a disaster for all of the zodiac signs, only about 4. The idea behind the movie was excellent, it could've been such a good movie if the script would've been written better. Really, if everything would've been better.

6777114,3,B00OYTCWIG,I enjoy disaster movies. I want to see out they are going to destroy the earth and at the last minute our hero saves us. It is a 90 minutes to 2 hours of not worrying how the governments are destroying world. The acting was fine. Love Joel he's a great actor the guy that played his son wasn't bad. The others could use a little work. I liked the idea of the script but it really could have been written better. Overall it's wasn't bad but far from great.,1455408000,,455,4.066666666666666

6777156,1,B00OYTCWIG,"Terrible disappointment here. Not interesting enough to be camp. Did anyone double-check the basic story or plot points before the shoot? I try to figure out who signed off on the completely unfollowable, totally illogical story before the scenes were broken down and the shooting started. It's that bad, you can't figure out how so much could go so wrong in a single movie making attempt.  I don't doubt the crew and tech people and actors' own skills, this kind of comprehensive badness simply wouldn't be the crew's fault.

Since clearly not able to work from a  budget for top of the line CGI or with known actors other than WONDERFUL comedic legend Christopher Lloyd [ADDAMS FAMILY, BACK TO THE FUTURE, TAXI], it would have been easy to forgive lots of small problems in  a B-movie *soft scifi* --this movie in particular--  if the story had either a believable plot or crossed over into it's own special world of a well-executed parody.

This piece of really bad cinema had neither, and is one of only a  few films I wish I'd never, ever devoted neural processing to. Watched it twice to make sure it wasn't that I'd missed something major in the story's logic, or that the lines the actors were forced to say were that bad.

There was one great scene discovering a post-apocalyptic Bunker Guy, that was very well done. It gave me some hope the film would redeem itself.

And that didn't happen.

Yo, if you want to show me an awesome global apocalypse, please don't try to convince me that it's all actually going to happen within 20 minutes/20 miles of where the scientist who created the only techno antidote to fixing the multi-apocalypse fu, all nature collapsing all at once, say,  has his corporate headquarters, and that guy happens to be in the deserted executive suite that day... Or that somewhere in New England there are, say, 20 dormant unknown volcanoes awaiting launch? One of these four ideas could have been OK, but stacking ridiculous plot points one atop the other pretty much leads to...total ridiculousness.

We were also shown early on, that one of the characters --who's not Christopher Lloyd's mad scientist-- somehow knows and may be in control of some aspects of meteoric showers, cyclones, flooding rivers. But no coherent reason, like from occult lore or myth or any other factor that can be determined by two viewings of this film,  is ever shown in a way that might connect these crucial plot dots. A discovery in a cave apparently in another country early on didn't really seem to justify the linking of either the apocalypse --or, much less, it's rate of unfoldment or control-- to this character.

Instead, generally bad [with a couple of really good exceptions of] CGI fx are trotted out in order to have us believe that the classic signs of the Zodiac will be...reproduced in THE SHAPE of the specific smoke, fire, water, lava flows, mud, twigs, and, I don't know, orange Tiki mugs full of frozen lemonade raining down on people's heads and destroying all cities of the world.

So I waited a month before writing this review because I respect indie filmmakers in particular, and then I realized I didn't want anyone else to have to invest their time in this incredibly bad film.",1425600000,3,3220,4.745519713261649

6777164,2,B00OYTCWIG,not my cup of tea / real close to being a fairly good movie / what with better acting / better script / better photography,1424390400,,122,3.92
6777165,3,B00OYTCWIG,"Oh my!  Well, I guess people don't generally turn to SyFy for the finest in motion pictures, do they?
With that in mind, I guess I should compare this to its competition.
I have to say, it's far from the WORST science fiction movie I've ever watched.  Of course it's a long
stretch from the best as well.

This is a film you can put on for amusement, perhaps walk in and out of the room at times without
pausing, and not have to worry that you'll no longer be able to follow the ""plot"" because you just
raided the fridge.

The script consists mostly of exclamations like, ""Watch out!""  ""Colin!""  ""Dad!""  ""OK"", ""Be careful!""
and similar original gems of brevity, though once in a while they throw in a short speech to justify
the action.  Not that the speeches are much better, just a bit more explanatory.

I hesitate to describe what went on as acting, but would observe (being of the other half of the human
race) that the film overall would have benefitted in direct proportion to any further reductions
in Andrea Brooks' clothing.  As it was she was typically bare-armed, with a moderately low-cut
top and long legged pants.  Andrea by the way is a competitive dancer and figure skater as well
as actress, and speaks French fluently though she's a native of Ontario, Canada.  She majored in
English Literature and Film and appeared in a number of commercials and TV shows before working up
to full-length films.  So, it IS possible to major in English without your future career involving a repetitive,
""Would you like fries with that?""

Still, there's something funky going on with her eyebrows in this movie.  She's clearly made up to be
a modern young lady with hair tinting, a ring nose etc, but something clearly went wrong with the
eyebrows which they failed to correct.

Special effects: some were rather nice for a small-budget production; others were...well, ridiculous.

""Plot""--I think the most interesting were the suggestions of incipient relationships.  Both the father
and the son were looking for a little love in their life and about 1/3 the way through, it looks as if
both might have found a match more or less simultaneously.  But this plot does deviate a little bit
from the totally mindless, ""all's well in the end"" style that is more common in this genre.

The zodiac classically (and here as well) has 12 signs, and in the film a natural disaster
is connected with each sign.  Toward the end, the cast had figured out 10 had already
occurred and each one is progressively more severe than the one before.  They manage
to divert number 11 just in time and--what?  Film over?  What about the 12th?  Maybe I
was raiding the fridge when that was explained....otherwise, it's a gaping hole in an already
tenuous story.  No, I'm NOT going back to figure it out....

8685495,5,B00OYTCWIG,"Not gonna lie, I watched this because it stars Reilly Dolman (from ""Travelers"" [2017], streaming on Netflix). So you'll probably expect me to say, next, that ""the acting is superb!"". And yes, even the unbiased me would agree to this. All the cast are quality (excepting maybe Sophie, who is like a ""cute girl filler"").

Cons: Obviously, the special effects are sub-par (low budget I'm guessing). There are a few logic holes, but some can be smoothed out in your own head if you think of creative enough explanations. Personally, I didn't like how the two females leads were constantly being aided up small inclines/out of cars etc by the two male leads, like they have 0 muscle mass. Too much of the action consisted of escape driving. (I don't like cars or drivingthey drive me crazy).

Pros: ACTING IS GREAT (Huge one). The underlying concept is juicy enough. Back to the Future references were nice. I also liked the character ""Marty"" and how they thought to include him in the story line.

Pro (or Con?): The kiss at the end. If only it didn't take a near-annihiliation of Earth and life as we know it to snag one from Reilly Dolman.",1495843200,,1137,4.618811881188119
