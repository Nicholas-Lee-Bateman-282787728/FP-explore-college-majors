219990,4,6300183807,"Directed by Burt Reynolds, with a local boy's eye for interesting locations, this has to be one of the better Elmore Leonard adaptations. A slightly grim tone adds realism. Cast: Charles Durning, Candice Bergman, George Segal, Burt and many other recognisable faces. Every character has something to offer to the involving storeyline. Good work by all. Dar Robinson...one of the stuntmen elite at the time, plays an albino gangster, and does a groundbreaking stunt at the end of this film. Good toughguy Burt action.

220300,4,6300183807,"If you're a Burt Reynolds fan I think you will like this movie, especially the villains if you give it a chance.

Burt Reynolds is Ernest ""Stick"" Stickly, a former criminal fresh out of prison who heads to Miami to see his former friends and daughter. When a deal his best friend was involved in goes bad Stick gets caught between two gangs who suddenly both want him dead.

If you like movies like Payback and Faster where you root for the bad guy to get his revenge this movie is in the same vein though not as fast paced in parts as the two mentioned. The real standout of the film is the late stuntman/actor Dar Robinson who plays Moke, an albino enforcer who is Stick's most persistent foe in the film.

So in my opinion this is a really good film, worth owning or watching. Come for the Burt Reynolds and stay for the Dar Robinson. It's worth it.",1374883200,,852,4.279503105590062

Man perfect casting. The last stunt where Moke falls of the balcony and unloads all 6 shots is nothing short of genius! I've seen Dar in many clips and he's the nicest guy. what an actor to play Moke. Burt Reynolds knew what he was doing when he got Dar involved in this flick.

220329,2,6300183807,"After a string of box-office disappointments, ""Stick"" (1985) represented Burt Reynolds' last gasp as a major film star. However, this potentially strong Elmore Leonard adaptation was marred by studio-imposed reshoots and the actor's ill health. Director Reynolds has assembled an offbeat cast (notably Charles Durning in a ridiculous fright wig), but the crime thriller suffers from a wildly inconsistent tone. Judging by its atmospheric start, one senses that Burt's original cut was superior to the messy finished product.",1349308800,,524,5.730769230769231

Once again we get another Reynolds film that is packed with great character actors that lend an air of authenticity to the drama this film seeks to create.  Reynolds gives what may be his best performance in a starring role in this dark, but often humorous story.  It is a film I never get tired of watching and, unfortunately, one of those gems that gets overlooked by most.  It's a good ride and it's a good story.

220373,5,6300183807,"Stick and Sharky's Machine are two of my favorite Burt Reynolds movies.  I admit that I am a fan and have liked Reynolds since his days as Quint Asper on Gunsmoke.  Stick is based on the novel of the same name written by Elmore Leonard.  Mr. Leonard also wrote the script for the film.  One thing to be sure is that if Elmore Leonard wrote it, it will have some slick dialog.  This movie certainly does.  Burt Reynolds also directed this film and the beautiful Candice Bergen co-sars as an attorney and Stick's love interest.  Burt Reynolds, in my opinion, has always been under-rated as an actor and director.  This film tells the tale of an ex-con Ernest ""Stick ""Stickley, who serves his time for armed robbery and returns to South Florida to begin a new life.  He has a 15 year old daughter who lives there and he attempts to renew his relationship with her.  Stick quickly gets into trouble when his buddy from prison talks him into a delivery job and gets shot.  The story has a few twists and turns, but suffice it to say that Stick avenges his friend's death, saves the day (and his daughter who's been kidnapped by a drug kingpin), and wins the hand of the fair lady.  Charles Durning is a close friend of Reynolds and has been in several of his films.  He does an excellent job as Chucky, a bumbling drug dealer.  Like Sharky's Machine, this is one of those films that I can watch over and over again without growing tired of it.  If you like good old fashioned action and a good story, then this is the movie for you.  No special effects to speak of, just a good old movie the way they used to make them.",1330560000,3,1614,4.33
220374,4,6300183807,"Burt Reynolds show his great dramatic ability along with comic input in this story about recovery and getting back on your feet after tough times.  Truly an entertaining movie.  Not quite as good as Sharky's machine, but very entertaining.",1325980800,,239,5.102564102564102
220375,1,6300183807,"Being an Elmore Leonard fan, I ordered this one. I think there are two things that stand out about this movie: it portrays the sleezy world of south Florida drug lords, tough guys, and loud mouth rich jerks with great enthusiasm, while it employs some of the most transparently piss poor acting I've ever seen.  It makes Pink Flamingo look like Oscar material. Charles Durning, who has proven that he can characterize bad guys, was apparently directed to bring zippo to bear. The telling eye shots from Burt Reynolds to the cute 18 year old barmaid and back to Burt worked well. As did the reparte between Burt and Candace Bergen. George Segal, who has been known to do some fine work, also was not apparently asked to deliver much of anything except two funny jokes. (Question: what's the last thing that goes through a bug's mind when he hits the windshield?) So who the hell directed this gem?  Burt Reynolds.
Normally, Elmore Leonard will deliver, but not in this one. Your twenty bucks might be better spent on a cup cold South Beach espresso.",1320537600,,1048,4.65945945945946

This order arrived fast, fast, FAST, and I merely chose ground cheapo shipping.  I was absolutely ecstatic to watch this on dvd for the first time.  And it's actually pretty refreshing to put in the dvd and have it just start playing, no mucking about with a menu or annoying previews.  The disc is widescreen with perfect sound, and as others have said this is one of Burt's best 80's movies (not to mention he directed it, and you have the awesome Dar doing stunts as well as acting, and this era of Miami is quite fascinating and beautiful to look at).  The disc will even repeat play on its own.

220380,5,6300183807,"I lived in Miami in 1985 when I saw Stick at the theatre.  I lived there for many years so this movie is very nostalgic for me.  I know all of the scenes in the movie from first hand experience.  I've visited most of the places shown in the movie and I lived specifically (for 20 years) in Coconut Grove where Chucky's office is located and where Bunny Eyes fell and missed the pool.  I lived a block away from that building and drove past it every day.  Now, enough about my nostalgia.  This a film depicting the Cocaine Cowboy era of Miami.  It's got action, romance, humor, innocence, soft mystery and suspense.  It's a portrait of the 80's scene in Miami, the cool, but just a little cheezy culture, of that time.  What I like best of Stick is that everything in it is real to the time and culture of 80's Miami drug dealers.  The clothing and language is real and very peculiar to that era and Miami in general, today.  Even the black magic is true to the genre.  Stick (Burt Reynolds) is a calm and cool ex-con just out of prison.  Not really a bad guy at all, just a bad decision maker.  That's what got in the slam.  He meets up with an old prison buddy who gets in trouble along with Stick. He's in denial about the fact that thru the movie he's on a vendetta about his friend - but realizes in the end that his ""good heart"" is whom he really is.

So, watch and enjoy this Miami Vice time-period film and appreciate the qualities of Burt Reynolds as an actor with all his ""Burt Reynolds"" nuances.  Sit back and slip-back into a world known only to those who were there!  I'll guarantee you'll feel good at the end.

PS.  Candice Bergen makes a ""hot"" financial advisor, too!",1297814400,7,1682,4.262658227848101
220381,5,6300183807,"Character development lacks in so many modern movies, but not with Stick. Burt Reynolds plays an amiable yet tough ex con trying to right his life after being released from prison. However things start out badly as he hooks up with his former cellblock buddies with ties to the underworld. The plot takes off quickly with a cast of colorful characters and escalates to a crecendo and a near fairy tail ending, complete with a sweet musical score by Anne Murray.  OK, Burt talking hispanic is a bit of a stretch and the Katie character (Burt's daughter) was a little smarmy, but those are my only criticisms, and very minor ones at that.  Bottom line is, this movie had me sucked in 2 minutes after it started, and did not let go. Two thumbs up from the peanut gallery!",1292803200,3,768,4.517985611510792
220382,4,6300183807,"If you are like me and own a ''DVDR digital copy from VHS'' of that ''never-released commercially on DVD'' movie you will be curious enough to go for that Vault Series Edition. Quality of the widescreen picture is A+ perfect, much better then the full-screen version that's been sitting on my shelf for years. The annoying part is the ''no menu'' format.
To at least put a background picture with one option to play the movie would be a tremendous addition. Having a movie starting without being able to control it is extremely weird. That being said, never mind Burt Reynolds, this movie should be remembered for Dar Robinson's performance. Hopefully, a commercially released DVD will one day include the behind the scenes shooting of the final stunt (available on the documentary The Ultimate Stuntman). Simply amazing.

220420,5,6300183807,"I have been waiting for this gem to be out for some time, every other Universal film that came out in 1985 (Back To The Future, Fletch, Breakfast Club, Into the Night) had been put out, but not this one, Imagine my surprise when I discovered it on DVD as a Amazon Exlcusive, I immediately ordered it, this is one of Burt Reynolds' underated films, because this film takes place in Miami, I think it was somewhat overshadowed by Universal's hit show ""Miami Vice"" at the time in 1985, but it is still a good film, but more of a character study than a shoot-up fest, not as action packed as Reynolds' other film ""Sharky's Machine"", but just as good I think,  like other reviewers here, I too was a bit concerned with how it would look, but after watching it, I have to say it looks  much better than it did on VHS, it seems Universal gave Amazon the master copy, because it looks as if Universal did it themselves even though Amazon did, it is as good as it could be, true, there is no Menu screen, but better to have it than not have it, now if Amazon would only do the same for Jeff Bridges' ""8 Million Ways to Die"" or Universal's ""The Wild Life"", then I would be really pleased, if DVD-R is the only way to go, then I say do it too!!",1278028800,2,1233,4.154811715481172
220421,4,6300183807,"While the new trend toward burn on demand DVD-R has its share of detractors, if that's the only way we're going to get long overdue catalog titles like this, I say keep them coming!  The picture here is excellent (much better than poor Burt has been treated over the years on DVD with full frame disasters littering his output) and the bonus here is the sound.  The back cover said 2.0 sound, but popping this in the player, it quickly turned out to be a full 5.1 soundtrack, a most unexpected bonus that helped a bit to salve a slight disappointment.  The credits, oddly, read like those in the original 1984 version that was never released, with Annie Potts' name listed and Snuff Garrett as music producer.  By the time it opened on April 26, 1985, Potts had been edited out and Barry DeVorzon and Joseph Conlan's great electronic score was in place.  I have posters from the aborted 1984 release and the final 1985 release and verified that the credits on the back of this DVD were from the original.  SO...the occasional optimist in me thought maybe a rare print had been burned to the Vault Series, but no such luck.  (Anyone ever seen this elusive version?)  For Burt fans, this is a fine product and another success for the series, with the exceptional sound transfer a most welcome surprise.",1275696000,5,1300,4.597402597402597
220422,5,6300183807,"A classic 80's action movie with perfect cheesey drug deal gone bad storyline and revenge!  Besides the movie being great by itself, the soundtrack to this movie is perfect.  If you are a fan of synthesizer music from great composers like Jan Hammer and Harold Faltermeyer, then this movie and it's awesome soundtrack are for you!  This is a DVD-R and not a standard pressed DVD, but don't let that scare you away..the quality is exactly the same as a pressed DVD, though it may have problems in some DVD-ROM drives on computers.  This is the widescreen edition of Stick, a film that belongs in any action fan's library!",1275350400,13,620,4.660550458715596

I had never purchased one of these before, so I was a bit worried about the picture & sound quality. However my fears were laid to rest once the disc arrived. The picture & sound quality come across as good as any other standard DVD. As reported by Robbie, there is no menu or special features, so it's just straight into the film. Thanks to Universal & Amazon for this gem of a film. Recommended.",1267747200,24,557,4.365384615384615
220425,5,6300183807,"This is one of Burt's better films from the 1980's, with a good supporting cast around him. Burt plays an ex-con who gets on the bad side of some nasty drug dealers in Miami. The movie has some comedy mixed with some romance and plenty of violence. Though I'm no expert on the subject, the video/audio transfer from vhs to dvd seems to be really good. My only minor complaint is that there is no menu or extras on the disc. A behind-the-scenes look at the filming of this movie would have been interesting, as there was a great stunt performed towards the movie's ending. Also, on the back of the dvd case, it states that this disc may not play on a dvd recorder or PC. However, when I played it on a PS3, I had no problems.

220427,5,6300183807,"""Stick"" is actually one of Burt's better action movies, in my opinion on par with ""Sharkey's Machine"". It is certainly better than ""Malone"" and way better than the horrible flick ""Heat"". The film has some colorful characters and great action scenes. The late great Dar Robinson, one of the best stuntsmen ever, gives a memorable performance as an albino hitman. He also performs an incredible stunt at the film's end.
