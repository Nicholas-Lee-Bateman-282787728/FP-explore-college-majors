8662189,5,B00KWFJPYA,"A beautiful set from a very underrated director, watching a Hou Hsiao-Hsien movie is akin to strolling down the backstreets of Taiwan. His tendancy to put character and mise en scene before traditional narrative may alienate some, but for those special few for whom these wonderful works connect, he masterfully builds a vivid depiction of the world he grew up in. His work has been compared to Ozu, but I see it more as a Taiwanese manifestation of the Dogme 95 aesthetic. Along with minimal camera movement and underdramatized narratives, Hou keeps a lot of distance between the audience and the characters, often abandoning closeups for wider shots that allow the protagonists to sink into the world around them, or as Hou himself says ""A good director will veil his subjects and weave them into the film's texture, making the seemingly fixed images speak a thousand words.""

This box set is released by Hou's own company, SinoMovie, and as far as I can tell, is one of the three non-bootleg box set releases of his work (The others being the gorgeous but sadly out-of-print 1983-1986 box set with The Boys from Fengkuei/A Summer at Grandpas/A Time to Live, A Time to Die/Dust in the Wind, as well as the recent Central Motion Picture Corporation blu-ray two pack of A Time to Live, a Time to Die and Dust in the Wind.) I have seen other listings for an 8 film box set, but as near as I can tell these are not authentic, and are probably bootlegged from the two 4-film box sets. At the very least I have been unable to find any information that verifies its authenticity.

This set, however, is a real joy to look at. The picture quality is significantly better than the 1980's box set, which was unfortunately plagued by heavy windowboxing and poor transfers. There is some slight windowboxing on this release, but its barely noticeable, and the image is mostly clear and crisp, especially by Chinese home video standards. The one exception is Flowers of Shanghai, which is decidedly fuzzy throughout with evidence of image artifacts, but sadly this is still probably the best it will ever look in an English friendly release. The box is a sturdy plastic material printed with black and white images taken from the movie, and also holds a 32 page booklet with a directors statement and notes for each of the four movies, printed in both Chinese and English. The only two faults I can find with this set are the dimensions of the product (It's taller than a normal DVD release, so its tough to fit on a shelf) and the subtitles could use some improvement, with occasional typos, grammatical errors, or missing punctuation, though it's certainly no worse than the vast majority of Asian releases, and it doesn't significantly hinder comprehension.

All in all, this is a wonderful set and one of the gems of my collection. With the shameful fact that so much of his work remains unavailable on home video, interested viewers should grab these while they can.",1424563200,4,2960,4.7436893203883495
