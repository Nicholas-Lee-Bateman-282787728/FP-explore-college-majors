8320676,4,B001M9ELPI,"Dwayne Johnson, ""The Rock"", does a fine job in all three of these movies. This is a good value because you save eleven dollars from buying them individually.

Scorpion King - Dwayne plays an unequaled Styrgian assassin. He and his brothers are hired by several tribes to kill a tyrant King that is taking over everything. Good sword & sandal action movie.

Doom - Dwayne plays a military group leader that is to lockdown a biological testing facility when something escapes. The problem is most of the people are unchanged, but not for long when they aren't released. Based on the game, the movie has some scenes that look like you are the first person shooter. Good SciFi action.

Rundown - Dwayne plays a tough bounty hunter that is hired to get a man's son back to him. He has to go to a diamond mine in the jungle  that is run by Christopher Walken, and Walken is one bad guy that won't give up the son because he knows where a large emerald is located. Great action. I hope to see him in more movies like these.

If you enjoy this, catch ""Total Recall"".
