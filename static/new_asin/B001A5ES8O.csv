3445619,3,B001A5ES8O,"The film is very light weight but still enjoyable.  The iambic pentameter opening seems very dated.  However Dick Powell does a reasonable job.  Fred Waring the and Pennsylvanians are in fine voice and the dance numbers still work.  The finale is very cute -- particularly as the various levels of law enforcement come into the theater and end up watching the show.  Look at the college hazing -- now mostly a thing of the past, curfews, the old cars -- driving to NYC instead of taking the train (at least for the college kids).  Most people who buy the DVD will probably watch this film more than once",1238198400,,603,4.537037037037037
3445620,4,B001A5ES8O,"Varsity Show may not be the best movie musical ever made; but it's much better than I anticipated. The plot moves along very well and the acting is convincing. There are several cute, catchy musical numbers and it's a real treat to see Fred Waring And His Pennsylvanians in this picture. Busby Berkeley gives us a finale proving his superlative skill as a choreographer.

The action starts when Winfield College is putting on their annual show--but it is being severely hampered by stuffy Professor Sylvester Biddle (Walter Catlett). Biddle will not allow what was then modern swing music in the show; and the result is that the performance is going to be boring with students who are demoralized. Even Ernie Mason (Fred Waring), the faculty member closely supervising the kids and their show, just doesn't have enough clout to change Professor Biddle's mind.

The students, including Barbara 'Babs' Steward (Rosemary Lane), Betty Bradley (Priscilla Lane) and Cuddles (Mabel Todd), decide to call on Winfield College alumnus and Broadway producer/star Chuck Daly (Dick Powell) to help them in their hour of need. They hope that maybe Daly can use his influence to change Biddle's mind and make the show much better. Daly takes along his sidekick Willy (Ted Healy) when he leaves Manhattan for Winfield College. Unfortunately, what the college kids don't know is that Daly has hit on hard times and that he's considered a ""wash-up.""

Daly's tries to help the kids but he fails when he goes up against the school board. Daly strikes up a romance with ""Babs"" but he and Willy return to New York. The college kids come up with the idea to take their show to New York where they can put it on free of Professor Biddle--and prove that Chuck Daly is still a star after all!

Questions still linger, though: Will the kids from Winfield College be able to fight off the New York City theater owner--and law enforcement--when they are being forced out of the theater for not paying the bill? What will happen to Chuck Daly's romance with Babs after he leaves Winfield College to return to New York? Will Chuck Daly be able to regain fame and fortune to be a star again? Watch the movie and find out!

The song and dance routines are not bad at all, actually. One of my favorites is ""I'm Working My Way Through College"" which is at the beginning of the film; and the elaborate song and dance routine at the end showcases Busby Berkeley's talents as one of the best choreographers the world has ever seen. Look also for some wonderful dancing and singing by John Bubbles and his partner Ford Washington Lee; they play two maintenance men at the college. Their roles are embarrassingly outdated but their song and dance work still shines bright!

The DVD comes with two good Vitaphone shorts: A Neckin' Party and the 1938 Merrie Melodies cartoon entitled Have You Got Any Castles?

Varsity Show is not a film to toss aside and forget. Sure, it's fluffy; but then again there are times when a light fluffy musical comes in rather handy. I recommend this picture for picking up your spirits on a dark and dreary day.",1230422400,6,3101,4.731481481481482
3445621,2,B001A5ES8O,"""Varsity Show"", a Warner's musical from 1937, is an inexplicably long and extravagant college musical with a cast of generally second rate musical performers. When the cast lists a band leader as second in the credits and the ghastly Ted Healey third, you know that the film will be weak.  Dick Powell is the sole star in this one and if he is a little less ebullient than normal, put it down to the dumb screenplay and stupid part he was given as a Broadway producer down on his luck and recruited by the students of his Alma Mater to put on their annual show. There are a few good points:

- The finale staged by Busby Berkeley, a rousing tribute to the Ivy League
- Priscilla Lane, spunky and very cute, in her movie debut, even if her singing is characterless and her voice thin.
- Buck and Bubbles, 2 peerless black performers performing their act with especially good tap dancing from Bubbles.

Unfortunately, the negatives are too obvious:

- Rosemary Lane playing the romantic lead opposite Powell. Lane has charm to spare but her trained operetta soprano does not lend itself readily to pop songs.
- tiresome performers such as Johnny Scat Davis and Mabel Todd, doing there thing with forced charm or lack of it in Todd's case.
- endless dreary dialogue between the collegiates as they plan their next strategy for outwitting Walter Catlett as a square professor. Catlett was a renowned scene stealer and a very funny comedian but his lines here are really awful.

The print of the film is OK but it is incomplete. There are holes in the continuity and at least 2 songs are missing such as the Lane Sisters duetting ""Love is on the Air Tonight"" towards the end of the film. The extras include a very worn theatrical trailer and a dreadful Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy short in poor condition. In fact the best thing on the disk is the cartoon, in which the songs from the film are interpolated into a delightful fantasy as the covers of books, many of which were made into films of the era, come to life and thereby depict the leads of the films (e.g Victor McLaglan in ""The Informer"" and Paul Muni in ""Louis Pasteur"").  There is a perfunctory introduction about the politically incorrect depictions of negroes which I thought completely unnecessary, especially when the black depicted is the great Cab Calloway who had a unique performing style.

The DVD might be of interest as part of the Busby Berkeley Collection Volume 2, but otherwise, don't bother.",1226880000,,2466,4.668202764976958
3445622,3,B001A5ES8O,"Winfield College is putting on their annual production, but this year their director is really bringing them down. Instead of a fun, modern show, he is forcing them to perform in a play with no laughs and outdated music. A group of kids decide to enlist the help of a former student who has made it big on the Great White Way. Chuck Daly (Dick Powell) has fallen on hard times, and his partner (Ted Healy) forces him to accept the $1000 offered him to fix the college musical. Once there, he realizes usurping the faculty will be much harder than he expected. But that suits him just fine; there is a pretty girl (Rosemary Lane) occupying his time.

Powell and Lane do not have great chemistry together so the love story is quite thin. The plot leaves something to be desired as well, but it isn't the story that makes this film enjoyable; it's the music. The romantic melody ""You've Got Something There"" is staged simply, but with the lovely lyrics, this is appropriate. ""We're Working Our Way Through College"" is done simply as well, although the moving camera makes it seem more complex than it actually is. The song is peppy and funny, the perfect college song. ""Have You Got Any Castles, Baby"" is a very dancable tune which was made into a Merry Melodies short included on this disk. The real showstopper of the film, though, is the grand finale which features several different school songs the formations of the college letters. This number is simultaneously impressive and timeless.

Unfortunately, this print is considerably shorter than the original film which runs for two hours. Perhaps this version of the film was too deteriorated to be considered appropriate for release. There are several spots in this film that appear to have been neglected, so the film quality is not entirely consistent. Still, it is in much better condition than some films of the early 30s, so perhaps it is best not to complain too much. After all, it could be worse; at least the film is available now for viewing.",1221868800,6,2005,4.693181818181818
8276035,4,B001A5ES8O,"Oh, no! Winfield College is in trouble! No, wait! Correction: Winfield College's music program is in trouble! The Quadrangle Club may be disbanded! It's time for the annual varsity show, except it hasn't gone so well the past few years. Maybe because Prof. Sylvester Biddle (Walter Catlett), that old fussbudget faculty advisor, is staging the thing. He champions dignified terpsichore. He thinks the minuet is hot stuff. He regards jive and swing music as vulgar musical exhibition. What a wet blanket.

The students are in an uproar. They think the varsity show is gonna suck mightily. And then a lightbulb appears. Why not recruit the famous New York Broadway producer Chuck Daly (Dick Powell) to take over the varsity show? After all, Winfield is his alma mater.

Except Daly has had a tough year with three shows, three busts under his belt. His bank balance is $24. It may even be overdrawn. So maybe call it skewed altruism - let's not call it mercenary - but when the Winfield kids come begging and offer to pay him, well, there's Daly willing to give it the old college try.

VARSITY SHOW, a 1937 Warner Brothers joint. It is what it is. A ""let's put on a show"" college musical packed with juvenile humor and a smidge of vaudeville. The narrative is the sort of fable where the choir club is more popular than the football squad and Dick Powell's character can get away with a line like ""Kids come to school for something else besides sticking their noses in a lot of books."" Okay, Dick Powell.

It's the kind of movie where the ocarina and concertina are featured, where the baton twirler is awesome, and the black janitors have mad dance skills and end up in the big show. The most bewildering thing is that the girl with the glasses turns out to be the dimmest bulb in the room.

It's Warner Bros. so the production is glossy and slick, and the song lyrics bright and witty: ""If fair Helen's lovely lips could launch a thousand ships, you could split the universe in two."" ""I'm no social lion's rich daughter; my eyes have the look of dishwater..."" Good job to master lyricist Johnny Mercer. I feel everything is right with the world whenever Dick Powell gets a chance to croon. The Lane sisters are also great with their numbers.

Powell finds hasty romance with a college girl (Rosemary Lane); he looks young enough so, thank goodness, it doesn't get creepy.

Busby Berkeley is another star in this show, even though he doesn't get in front of the camera. But he directs the 11-minute finale extravaganza, and we'll just ignore the question of how a set that's fifty feet high and sixty feet wide can suddenly fit on the stage of that one theater that the Winfield kids take over to put on their show. I did like the ongoing gag of the theater manager, to whom the kids don't bother paying lease, keeps going up thru channels in his try to oust the interlopers. Again, this is a fable, and in a fable I guess if the theater manager calls the cops on the interlopers, why the interlopers will just have a sit-in, thank you. Anyway, it sort of works in the movie. Only thing is, if the kids were so keen on raising money, the audience they drew in that day defeats the purpose, doesn't it?",1520380800,,3201,4.546875
