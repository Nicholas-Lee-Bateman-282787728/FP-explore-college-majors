5408604,5,B00AB65T7W,"Love this show, DVDs are great.  You don't even have to love football to like this show.  Show characters are great.",1382227200,,116,4.476190476190476
5408605,4,B00AB65T7W,The League never fails to make me laugh out loud!  It has unexpected and dirty humor and is not just for the sports fan.  Don't be a frutata and buy it now!,1381104000,,156,3.84375
5408606,5,B00AB65T7W,love this show i own all the seasons so far. the bloopers are funny and they don't show them on tv only on the dvd,1380844800,,114,3.6
5408607,5,B00AB65T7W,"""The League"" keeps outdoing itself every season. It's a shame that there are limited episodes per season but the quality of each show is outstanding. I don't watch football and care even less about fantasy leagues, but ""The League"" is one of the funniest comedies that I ever have had the pleasure to watch. I've bought every season and am waiting for season 4 to be on sale soon. AND I'm waiting for season 5 to commence. Great DVD collection!!!",1369353600,,446,4.5875
5408608,5,B00AB65T7W,"I have not bought this from Amazon, but I watched when it was aired on TV, and it is absolutely hilarious.  I have seen all four seasons of The League, and it has yet to disappoint.  Be warned that this season is certainly the most crude season yet, and it is for Mature audiences only, but being a college student, NFL fan, and fantasy football player, I fit the perfect demographic for this show, and I love it.  I would not recommend this to anyone who is easily offended, as there is a lot of crude content, but for those who love football and fantasy football, and comedy, I would highly recommend this show.  Guest stars include Jerry Jones, Adrian Peterson, Ryan Fitzpatrick, and Deion Sanders among others.",1357862400,,714,4.5546875
5408609,5,B00AB65T7W,This is an absolute must watch if you love fantasy football! This show is extremely funny! Don't listen to the bad reviews about crude humor. I mean wht do you expect? It has nick kroll and his stand up acts are wonderful. The show sports some very beautiful women in it (Katie aselton and Nadine Velazquez to name a couple) and some nudity. People shouldn't come on here to bash a show that's crude to them. Don't like that type of humor then by all means don't watch. Simple as that.,1357689600,,485,4.34065934065934

5408612,5,B00AB65T7W,Not a fan of sitcoms.  This show is hilarious.  Love every moment of it.,1408924800,,72,4.071428571428571
5408613,3,B00AB65T7W,A good season but by no means the best one so far.  Hopefully season five we'll be back up there with the first few seasons.,1404777600,,124,3.96
5408614,3,B00AB65T7W,"The cover, case, and cd are of superb quality. However, the contents of the cd are not so great. I am pretty sure this review isn't about the show itself - so I will leave out my hardcore thoughts. I will say that unless you don't care about the content your kid watches, this isn't a good show for anyone under 16 or so... They are crude and .... Wait I said I wasn't going to critique the show. So yeah. great quality case and cd.",1402444800,,432,4.034883720930233
5408615,5,B00AB65T7W,Wish there were more seasons.  Even those of us who are not huge football fans enjoy this series.  Perfect casts and timely humor during each fantasy football season.,1393286400,2,166,4.892857142857143
5408616,5,B00AB65T7W,This was a gift and I was so very happy it arrived the day before Christmas!  My son has enjoyed having his own copy.,1389484800,,117,3.875
5408617,5,B00AB65T7W,"Great Christmas gift, looking forward to seeing his face because he loves this show so much and only has the first two seasons of it!",1387324800,,133,4.36
5408618,5,B00AB65T7W,"Love the show, just wished there were more episodes. i had to watch the first season twice to really get into it, but all the following seasons have been awesome. if you're a sports fan, especially football, or even if you just play fantasy football, you'll love it. but even if you're not a huge sports fan. the comedy and subtle humor is more than enough to keep you interested and laughing.  if you're a fantasy football player, you can totally relate to that part of the show, but theres enough comical interaction between the characters to keep you  entertained otherwise.  definitely recomend all the seasons of the league for comedy and even sports lovers.  plus, all the seasons can be found for pretty cheap, in the 14 - 20$ range most of the time, maybe cheaper around thanksgiving, blackfriday and christmas time.  most have!",1383177600,,836,4.7379310344827585
5408619,4,B00AB65T7W,"totally funny, but I think that other seasons have been better...still worth the watch.  Looking forward to catching up to Season 5 when it comes out.",1383004800,,150,4.769230769230769
8549677,5,B00AB65T7W,Funniest show in the history of television. Jumps the shark somewhere around the end of this season or the beginning of 5th season but I'm here to tell you the 1-2-3-4th seasons of this show can hang head-to-head with any other television show ever made. So funny.,1506643200,,264,4.638297872340425
8549678,5,B00AB65T7W,Great show! Super funny. If you're into comedy & football - this show is a no brainer.,1468195200,,86,4.117647058823529
