7752075,4,B01FWU12W2,"This film depicts the events surrounding Clarence Thomass Senate hearing on being appointed to the Supreme Court in 1991.  I remember it well as it was going on at the same time I was getting married.  And of course the World Series was going on.  The hearings were likely the more spellbinding.  Clarence Thomas was appointed by George H. W. Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the only black person on the court.  With Thomas, also black, it seemed assured he would be confirmed.  This is spite of the fact that he and Marshall couldn't be further apart philosophically.

The hearings were concluding with the Judicial Committee approving him for a full Senate vote when at the last minute, an agent for Sen. Kennedys office named Ricki Seidman (Grace Gummer) got a tip that a former colleague of Thomas (Wendell Pierce) alleges that Thomas sexually harassed her a decade earlier.  Anita Hill (Kerry Washington) was a law professor at the University of Oklahoma and was extremely reluctant to testify, given the nature and the notoriety it would surely create.

Washington and Pierce provide compelling performances consistent with what I remember.  What I don't remember is that Sen. Joe Biden (Greg Kinnear), who headed the committee seemed more concerned with just getting a vote rather than getting to the bottom of who Clarence Thomas is, or at least was, 10 years earlier.  With Washington scheduled to go first, Biden changed the order at the insistence of Thomass sponsor, Sen. Danforth (Bill Irwin).  After his denial of facts not put into evidence, the committee had few questions they could ask.  Biden also closed the hearings rather than listen to testimony of others who asserted the same harassment.

The HBO film does seem to take the side of Hill, but then so did I at the time.  I couldn't get past the fact that Hill had nothing to gain by coming forward with these claims.  In fact, she had to be pushed by Seidman and other close friends.  Having been in the workforce when these events allegedly took place, I can tell you that Hills lurid testimony is totally believable.  I saw much of the same thing and worse.  The film is very good, well scripted and certainly entertaining and appalling at the same time.  Recommended.",1465689600,5,2260,4.8359375
