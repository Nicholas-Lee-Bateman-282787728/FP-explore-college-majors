However it's for the presence of these true legends that make this movie a must see. The first real meat you are hit with (after the pleasantries of Jimmy Clanton, Alan Freed, and Chuck Berry) is an absolutely rousing review number by The Flamingos. It is clearly one of the show stopping moments in the movie. Then subsequent spine tingling numbers by Eddie Cochran, Richie Valens, and Jackie Wilson and holy cow.....what a barn burner this one is. It even has a convoluted plot that almost passes for a story with Alan Freed playing Mr. Nice guy. So why only 4 stars? Because if you really want to see a 5 star fifties R & R flick then these two are the supreme must see's. Rock Around The Clock. Line for line and frame for frame the best R & R fifties flick of all time. Then a close second is The Girl Can't Help It. Besides having the brilliant Tom Ewell and Edmond O'Brien there are 2 very big reasons to see this movie.....Jane Mansfield! OMG.....I don't think I'll ever recover from that woman. Seriously.....these two flicks are the best ever. Get them as soon as humanly possible!",1117929600,5,1224,4.593607305936073

A few names...Ritchie Valens, Jackie Wilson & Chuck Berry. Main actor/singer  is Jimmy Clanton with songs that thrill me till this very day. Hopefully  this movie will be released again soon!

He was one of the radio disk jockeys who paid attention to and promoted a ""new type of music"".......and he seems to have paid the price for it.

7813385,3,6301560620,"The yellow-covered VIDEO TREASURES tape pictured above was one of the first I purchased 25 years ago. I watched it again today after decades of idleness and the darn thing played GREAT!

Recorded in LP mode prior to the advent of HiFi audio, both the picture and sound on this VHS are exceptionally good for its day. Design may be a factor in why these VT tapes track so well: both reels have extra-large center spindles, fully two times normal size, and that may be the secret of their success (no engineer here!).

SYNOPSIS--
Orphan boy (Clanton) striving for his R&R break is just an excuse for many fine performances (and a few schlocky ones). Berry does three of his hits, the Cadillacs sound like the Coasters, 17-year-old Valens is outstanding in his only film, as is Wilson. As for legendary DJ Alan Freed, we all owe a great deal to this crusading integrator and champion of rock & roll. This one's a must-see for fans of 1950s pop, r&b and rock music.

7813386,5,6301560620,"I had been looking for this movie for a long time! Go Johnny Go surely shows the atmosphere of Rock 'N' Roll in the late 1950s. It's a must for all 50s music lovers. Staring Alan Freed,Chuck Berry,Jimmy Clanton & Sandy Stewart,the movie shows the attempt of a young man's effort to become a pop star. Showing these pop stars performing in their primes like Jackie Wilson,The Cadillacs,Chuck Berry,Jimmy Clanton & Sandy Stewart is worth the movie purchase!! Plus the acting is very good. You really feel the storyline.",1253577600,,517,4.820224719101123

7813388,5,6301560620,"Searched many years for this movie, and the music from it.  Plot is lame, but to see Alan Freed, and the great music stars from the 50's was worth the search.  In time I have been able to obtain the acutal recordings from the movie, one a 4 song 45 EP of J. Clantons songs in mint condition and the 45 singles for the Jackie Wilson, Chuck Berry.  The others I have found on albums or have had to settle for dubs from the film.  This has been released on CD and is available on Ebay, but be careful of the vendors there are bad copies a plenty.  Also note this VHS is recorded at the slowest tape speed and the quality is good, but suggest that a high speed copy be made early on, before the tape degrades.",1205884800,,705,4.043165467625899
7813389,4,6301560620,"This is good for a lazy weekend afternoon. Nice late 50s time capsule with R&R impresario Alan Freed hosting a ""story"" about forgotten rocker Jimmy Clanton's rise from orphanage to rock stardom. Chuck Berry (in a role he says took 5 days to film-no doubt) hangs out with Alan and performs the title cut, Memphis, and Little Queenie. There is also some nice rare footage from acrobatic doo-woppers the Flamingos, comedy doowooppers the Cadillacs, the legendary Jackie Wilson, Ediie Cochran and Ritchie Valenz before their untimely deaths, etc.

Leave your brains at the door, laugh at the dopey plot and cornball acting, and ENJOY THE MUSIC.",1160784000,,640,5.037735849056604
