3712763,5,B001NE80OA,"A friend bought tickets to see this film at Outfest in Los Angeles a couple of years ago and I went along without any expectations. I couldn't imagine being interested in the story of two Christian singers but the film turned out to be completely compelling. It's very funny for one thing and it sneaks up on you and draws you in emotionally as well without being in any way sentimental. I cried. I am very excited that it's now on DVD and seems to have some good extras on it. I recommend anyone who is considering it, to take a chance and order the DVD. By the way, it's a much better film than Benjamin Button, though that's another story...",1233360000,25,644,4.330578512396694
3712764,5,B001NE80OA,"This is a must see for everyone, gay and straight.  While it is the story of a gay Christian pop duo and their struggle for acceptance in the gay and Christian community which traditionally don't mix, at it's heart it's a love story.  Mr. Nunez does a wonderful job in illustrating the hate that these two must face without preaching to the viewer.  It may be a clich to say ""I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me"" but with this movie it's all true!",1230508800,36,454,4.195402298850575

3712767,5,B001NE80OA,"It seems as though there is a trend with documentaries telling the story about the lives of men struggling with their sexuality while maintaining a close relationship with God and their Christianity. I recently watched ""Call Me Malcolm"" and just yesterday I saw ""We're All Angels."" Both films portrayed men on a journey for understanding and purpose. While ""Call Me Malcolm"" dealt primarily with a transgender homosexual male, ""We're All Angels"" tells the story of Jason and deMarco, two gay Christian men simply trying to make a name for themselves in the Christian pop music world. There were moments of pure laughter when watching ""We're All Angels"" and moments of tears, mainly from the desire to be in a relationship similar to the one that Jason and deMarco have. I was fascinated by their ability to spend countless hours with each other, travel with one another, yet still be able love each other so deeply. What struck me most about this film was that I was not bombarded with their homosexuality, I truly felt as though I was watching a straight couple. Not that it matters either way, but for those afraid of seeing these film because of potentially graphic images, you are certainly mistaken and will most definitely be surprised. This film definitely leaves your curious for what is next for Jason and deMarco.",1272412800,2,1323,4.884444444444444
3712768,5,B001NE80OA,"While this film focuses on a gay Christian pop duo, is a definite must-see
for everyone. The film follows two gay male musicians who struggle for
acceptance in the Christian community. We follow the men while they deal
with their inner conflicts as well as the conflicts they face in their
everyday lives. The pair continues to write religious music, however, and
set out play their music across the country in order to spread awareness.
Aside from spreading the word about their music, these two men want to
spread a message of hope and acceptance to young gay Christian teenagers.
By offering their support, the two men hope to lower the suicide rate
among this demographic. This film has a definite sense of humor and does a
great job of proving a point without preaching.

If you're interested in LGBT documentaries, I would also recommend

3712769,5,B001NE80OA,"This film was extremely eye-opening and hopeful. Not only did this film teach me more about Christianity and its practices, but it brought a personal tone to it. It is inspirational to see two homosexual singers who are struggling to keep their place in the Christian community. The film has a great sense of humor and presents the story in a way that does not beg for pity or sentimentality. It begs a number of existential questions and guides us along the search for some sort of answer. This is one of the best movies regarding religion and sexuality that I've ever seen.",1271980800,,575,4.592233009708738
3712770,3,B001NE80OA,"This was a good portrial of a christian gay relationship. I was however hoping for deeper intermacy (not sexual) between the two; their interpersonal relationship apart from the misic. And how close friends and family members who are christian understood their journey. However, it is a good movie to begin discussions with christians with family members who are gay.",1265760000,2,367,5.237288135593221
3712771,5,B001NE80OA,"This documentary should be seen by everyone on both sides of the ongoing debate on gay marriage & gay rights in general. Thanks to two unlikely heroes, Christian singers who happen to be a gay couple, you'll be entertained & enlightened--even if you think you have your mind made up about any of the issues that come up in this film you'll probably re-think your position. This is a truly heartfelt movie but is neither cloying or pandering. Had this been a fictional story it might be too far-fetched but the fact that it's real has much greater impact.",1257552000,9,554,4.606060606060606
3712772,5,B001NE80OA,"Jason and DeMarco are amazing. I really love them a lot.  I purchased and watched We're All Angels a couple of weeks and now I'm hooked on their music. What voices!!! I am listening to ""All I Ask For"" right now and I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life...The Gospel genre is one of the few genre's of music I haven't listen to much of but I'm hooked on J&D's music. So inspiring & uplifting. I listen to it constantly...just love it.",1252022400,5,467,4.188888888888889
3712773,5,B001NE80OA,"Wish they had many more DVD's and Hit CDs......find them a very Loving couple. And wish them much sucess and long relationship and romance and LOVE............In Unity with their faith sharing of humanity with all us in the Gay Soceity and hoping to see them both in Movies one day. My suggestion is watch,learn,and listen to these Angels.",1244851200,5,339,4.862068965517241
3712774,3,B001NE80OA,"Gay and Christian are no longer mutually exclusive terms and these two little boys, cute as buttons and deeply in love with one another, are trying to make a change in the concept.  They sing with pretty voices, they know their music, they're a bit self-absorbed, but their story ends up capturing some level of attention.  I'm not sure they're going to make fans of a lot of gay men, but if given a little time they just might charm the gay viewer.  The story doesn't get going until about half-way through and some of the most interesting moments go by really quickly and involve looks on the faces of people in the background of the piece.  Not great documentary film-making, but engaging and rather uniquely interesting.",1238457600,4,724,4.677165354330708

8323693,1,B001NE80OA,"Boring docudrama which follows the two song performers as they do their musical tour.  It is more like Reality TV and seems it was a sort of spontaneous thing, for which the two singers were ill prepared.  I shut the film off after half an hour watching them preen in front of the mirror and act camp. Was not all that impressed, though the stars are very cute.",1456790400,,361,4.294117647058823

8323700,4,B001NE80OA,"It is rather amazing that this documentary film has only come to my attention five years after its initial release.  However, as it turns out, that fact adds depth and authenticity to a rather remarkable story.  This delightful singing duo has performed at my church, First MCC of Atlanta, twice during the past year, but it was only this past Sunday that we purchased the DVD.

The presentation is lively and very honest.  I don't know how widely it was circulated during the year of its initial release, but hopefully it made some significant impact.  Needless to say, the fact that these two young men are still together, as entertainers, witnesses to their faith, and as a committed couple, is where the authenticity comes from.

Hopefully, sometime in the near future, there will be a sequel, because there story has become much richer with the birth of their twin boys, now two years old.  As the issue of Gay Marriage is being revisited by a number of states as well as the Federal Government, it would be very helpful, I believe, to have this further affirmation of their successful and meaningful relationship.",1376352000,3,1119,4.796875
