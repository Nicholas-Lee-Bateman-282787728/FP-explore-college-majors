3649539,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I just got this in the mail today, and I am really disapointed.  Its very poorly made, the instructor voice is a little anoying, and they don't give enough time in the poses.  What they should do is tell what pose they are explaining at the BEGININING, so that if you have done yoga before, you can go ahead an get into the pose.  The way they do it is spend so much time explaining it that there is only a few seconds actually in the pose.  I assume after watching it a few times, I will remember which one they are doing, so I don't have to wait to go into the pose.  I don't like how many props they say are required.  I don't mind the blocks and blankets, but the chair and bolsters (pillows)... its just a little too much.  Maybe for someone new to yoga, they might be needed.  But some of the poses she is doing, you do not need THAT much modification - like modified downward dog (using a chair) in 2nd trimester??  Other prenatal yoga videos - Jennifer Wolfe - do them fine without a chair.  I wanted a video that would be a lighter, easier workout than the Jennifer Wolfe one, and this one is too slow and too much trouble (props).  I will probably use it some since i already bought it, but without some of the props.  I would only recommend this to someone that is new to yoga and needs the extra support & instruction.

Update
I changed my reveiw from 2 stars to 1 because I only used it twice, both in the 2nd trimester. I tried it in my third trimester, but it was tooooo easy!!! I really hate this video and it was a complete waste money.  DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE ANY YOGA EXPERIENCE, AS THIS WILL PROBABLY BE WAY TO EASY AND VERY ANNOYING VIDEO.  Oh, it has NO flow, which is also very annoying for someone who has done yoga before.",1246579200,14,1747,4.112094395280236
3649540,5,B001IQ8BCY,"If you are pregnant and have had Morning Sickness, Back Pain, Bloating or pretty much any of the other things that we go through during the trimesters, you owe it to yourself to get this DVD.

It is designed to provide you with gentle, and what I have found very effective, yoga routines to help you out.  Plus there are some general things to do on those days that you just want a gentle yoga workout.

Mary provides very good introductions for each trimester and carefully lays out what to expect physically (which you may or may not know, but even if you do it is interesting in the context of yoga.)

The instruction is very well planned out and I felt safe and comfortable so far using this DVD, Mary makes sures to set things up so to have all the physical support and positioning.

It is more of a treatement and relief DVD, together with good stetching and relaxtion, more than a workout DVD, which was just what I wanted.  If you are looking for a very active workout, other DVDs may be more to your liking.  But if you want relief and safe yoga, this is extremely good and should be kept around for the days you need it.",1246320000,5,1130,4.30188679245283
3649541,4,B001IQ8BCY,"This video has some really good stretches, but I thought it was pretty boring.  I am still doing this every night before bed because it does seem to help prevent the back pain I was having before.  This video alone is not enough exercise for pregnancy.  I do more strenuous exercise in the morning and then do this at night to relax before bed.",1243468800,4,344,4.34375
3649542,5,B001IQ8BCY,"I have used this now for a little over three months and could not be happier.  I started in the middle of my first trimester and the selection of routines for helping was perfect and I am finding the same so far in my second trimester.

I really appreciate the pace and how it is put together, I feel very comfortable doing these.",1237507200,,330,4.222222222222222
3649543,5,B001IQ8BCY,"I am nearing the end of my second trimester and this is my second pregnancy.  My first was very easy and I was happy to continue with a modified version of my fairly intense pre-pregnancy fitness program.  This time around I wanted something more nurturing and something I could do at home.

My midwife suggested yoga. I had done some post-natal yoga however I would say I am a beginner.  I purchased 2 DVDs and we reviewed them together. She felt both would be fine for me. I am using both of them although I find myself reaching for this one more often.

There is plenty of material on this DVD and it will take you through your pregnancy. It offers routines for each trimester and has been very helpful with dealing with not so wonderful symptoms that can come with pregnancy.

There is only one model demonstrating the routines. (A different one for each trimester). These woman seem to be very experienced and not just pregnant models. I prefer to have only one person to watch.

The instruction is very detailed but easy to follow. This isn't a fast paced workout so you have time to follow the direction, get into the pose, adjust as needed and you won't feel rushed to move along to the next one.",1233878400,16,1204,4.470319634703197
3649544,5,B001IQ8BCY,"I started with Iyengar style yoga classes about 6 months before I became pregnant. It's a type of yoga that relies a little more on props and you spend more time getting in and staying in a pose. Being not so flexible and having some back issues it was a good choice for me.

I had hoped to take pre-natal classes at the same studio, but at the beginning of my pregnancy I just wasn't up for going after a day at work. I wish I'd have found this DVD sooner (I'm at the end of my 2nd trimester now). The ones I did get were much faster moving and didn't use much if any props. I wasn't comfortable with that on my own.

For any pregnant woman who is new to yoga or looking to use yoga to relieve pregnancy symptoms and be more comfortable, I think this is a good choice.  There are routines for each trimester that deal with specific issues we face during those times and offer modifications that make it very safe for you and your baby.

I also appreciate that I only have one model to watch doing the routines appropriate for where I am in my pregnancy.  With other DVDs I found it difficult to keep my eye on the one in the room at my stage.",1233792000,3,1143,4.084821428571429
3649545,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I'm no where close to a yoga expert, but I have take a few classes.  That said, this dvd was very frustrating for me.  They take SO much time over explaining the poses that there is no time to really relax into them. Plus, the poses do not flow together (which to me is one of the most important aspects of yoga).  The whole dvd is very ""stop and start"" and really too easy.  The modifications for the 1st trimester portion are almost completely unnecessary, as well as many in the 2nd trimester portion.",1233187200,2,504,4.329787234042553
3649546,5,B001IQ8BCY,"As I started my third trimester I was happy I bought this DVD even though I had some others.  This one seems to really understand what I am going through as my body changes (okay, I am bigger now) and the issues in the trimesters with a selection of routines for each trimester and the changes.

Very well thought out DVD and addresses what I feel.  The backache routine is helpful, and I am also really enjoying the energizer and general routine.  I am actually still able to do some yoga now, it is easy and gentle.",1232064000,11,517,4.298969072164948
3649547,5,B001IQ8BCY,"I picked this up to continue my yoga and hopefully help with some issues and so far it is working - the routine for morning sickness has really seemed to help the last 10 days or so and that alone makes this worthwhile to me even if I do not use anything else.  I had bad morning sickness the first time I was pregnant and it was happening again.

There are sections for all trimesters (I am only using the first right now) and like Denise Austin's video, this one seems very focused on keeping exercises safe.  There is alot of good information about how to use the DVD, proper positioning of your body with support where needed, and other items.

A quick look at the later trimesters looks good and they look tailored for proper physical support, but I have not yet used them.",1230854400,10,778,4.344827586206897
3649548,2,B001IQ8BCY,I am new to yoga and found this video a bit tricky.  For some poses you need to be against a wall.  My tv and DVD player are not near one and I felt doing some of the balance yoga positions without a wall are too difficult during pregnancy since our sense of balance is off,1377907200,,273,3.857142857142857
3649549,2,B001IQ8BCY,"If you are looking for ROUTINES this is NOT the product for you. It says on the front that there are 'routines for: Morning Sickness, Lower Back Pain, Rejuvenating and Relaxation' but this is not accurate. It is actually one woman doing a pose and then in a different setting, time and with different music showing you another pose... for 45 min or however long you choose. The videos left me feeling agitated and irritated rather than relaxed and worked out. Go get Shiva Ray's maternity yoga video - it is wonderful, and is a routine that begins with meditation and ends with relaxation .... this video doesn't begin or end ... it just starts and stops. I am returning it ASAP.",1366243200,,679,4.573770491803279
3649550,1,B001IQ8BCY,"Please don't waste your money on this DVD, it's really awful! I can't even watch it, the place is horrible, dark, with a piano and candles in the middle of a living room worthy of an Agatha Christie's tales of a crime scene, not for a expecting mom doing yoga! There's not a inch of a yoga ambient!. There's tons of others good yoga DVD's for pregnancy, listen to the reviews (I didnt!) and don't waste your money in vain. I bought it because it was cheap, the case was fine and last for 2 hours but please don't make the same mistake!. Helping you is my only comfort because it can't be return once is opened.",1313452800,,610,4.222222222222222
3649551,4,B001IQ8BCY,"The video was great, but it was pretty hard for me being in my second trimester with twins, and never having done yoga before. I couldn't make it through the first work out the first time. It took some building up to. Also requires some equipment that I had to substitute.",1305763200,,272,4.352941176470588
3649552,3,B001IQ8BCY,"I didn't buy this until my 3rd trimester.  I like that there are many different routines to do, so you are not repeating the same ones over and over.  I did not like that the woman doing all the 3rd trimester exercises was really unattractive and looked like she was stuck in the 80's.  It it easier to take it more seriously when you are looking at a more current looking person.  I did not like that there are many materials needed for all routines.  I had to make do with what I had (pillows, blankets, fold up chair, books for blocks).  overall this has really good exercises.",1300320000,,580,4.324074074074074
3649553,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I would say that I am at an intermediate level of yoga and in my first trimester, and I did not find this dvd helpful at all.  The poses are very simple, but I didn't find much of a stretch in them.  The biggest problem is that they jump from one pose to another without any transition.  One second you are up against a wall standing, freezeframe switch screens, and the next second you are sitting in the middle of your mat.  I was constantly stopping the dvd, moving all of the stuff and repositioning every few minutes.  Also, there were way too many props needed: mat, 2 blocks, 2 rolled blankets or pillows, chair, etc.  I got more of a stretch and workout from moving all of the props around inbetween each pose.  Very disappointed!

I also bought Sara Holliday's Prenatal Yoga First Trimester, and I really enjoy it.  There is a natural flow between poses with good stretch and just the right amount of intensity for my first trimester.",1299715200,2,943,4.4678362573099415
3649554,3,B001IQ8BCY,"This DVD is fine.  The exercises are slow and gentle for pregnancy, which is a must.  The one thing I don't like is that you need so many props to do the exercises - 2 wooden blocks, a strap, 3 folded blankets.  I was looking for something a bit more simple.",1296518400,,258,4.019607843137255
3649555,2,B001IQ8BCY,"This product, in my opinion, is not for beginner yoga - pregnant women. The dvd has difficult and extreme stretching for a pregnant women.",1293840000,,138,4.791666666666667
3649556,5,B001IQ8BCY,I bought this DVD a week after I learned I was expecting and I'm now in my 5th months and still enjoying it.  I had never done yoga before but heard it was really good for pregnancy.  At first I thought it was too easy.  As my pregnancy has progressed I'm finding that it's perfect.  The routines for specific pregnancy related issues have been a big help.  I haven't tried any other prenatal yoga programs because this one is still working well for me.  I'd recommend it and bought copy for a friend.,1291852800,,501,4.333333333333333
3649557,2,B001IQ8BCY,"I just got this video, and don't like it for a number of reasons.  First, the yoga studio is old and really gross, it looks like a moldy basement.  For some reason I think Yoga is more relaxing in an open, fresh and clean atmosphere.  The photo on the front is certainly deceiving!  The other huge problem is that you have to do most of these poses up next to a wall, which I don't have.  I read the instructions closely before buying, and you do need a few things like a blanket, etc.  I have all that, but no wall!  It is annoying.  Now I can't use the DVD at all.  Almost all the routines are the same but in different orders.  Not my favorite to say the least.",1284336000,2,664,4.038461538461538
3649558,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I had one Prenatal Yoga DVD but it only had one routine on it.  I was looking for something that had more options.  While this video had options, I didn't like the flow of it.  It didn't flow from one pose to the next without a break in the video.  The background is like something from a house in the 1970s.  And they really should have a voice sample before you buy it.  The instructor's voice is annoying.",1277078400,,408,4.166666666666667
3649559,5,B001IQ8BCY,"If you are looking for a pure workout DVD, then you probably want to pass on this one.  This DVD, however, is PERFECT for what it says it does -  highly effective and which focus on your health at the same time.

They may move more slowly than a traditional ""workout,"" but if you are feeling bloated, having trouble having sleeping or having other issues this will take care of it in a safe and well thought out manner.  There are some general things for just feeling better also.

A definate plus to add to help you out.  I use this 2-3 times a week to feel better, and the back pain poses makes it worth the price in and of itself.  I grew along with each of the people doing the poses (there is a different one for each trimester)

If you want some nice gentle things to just focus on yourself and feel better, you should get this. It takes a few moments to set up (the first time until you know what to expect, and there are clear instructions at the beginning of each thing to do.)  If you are impatient or not one to focus on details to make sure everything is done cautiously, find something else.",1274832000,4,1104,4.194312796208531
3649560,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I purchased this DVD in my second trimester to help mix up my fitness routine because I was getting a little bored with my walk/jog one day, prenatal workout the next. I was very unhappy with this DVD. I was expecting a good stretch and maybe a little workout... not the case. A lot of the poses seemed like they would work if I were in my 90s! The person in the workout seemed very blah and boring as well, she didn't change her facial expression once! Now for the music, it was piano music and the setting was an old mansion with a piano in the background. I felt like I stepped back into the 70's and did not feel like the ""workout"" worked me out at all.",1273104000,,657,4.10077519379845
3649561,5,B001IQ8BCY,"This video was so great for me during my pregnancy. It offers easy/moderate/hard routines for each trimester, giving you the choice of difficulty throughout your pregnancy. Regardless of the difficulty level, you feel like you have had a good workout every day. I noticed an increase in my energy level within the first 2 weeks. It was wonderful! I recommended it to a couple of my pregnant friends!

The only disappointment was that, as my pregnancy proceeded, it was difficult to keep up motivation and the guide was not very encouraging in this. I found that if I missed even 1 day, the next time I did the video it was more difficult. It was difficult to take time off from the program and restart, especially late in my pregnancy. But that was mostly my lack of discipline and focus not the video's fault at all.",1272240000,,817,4.595890410958904
3649562,2,B001IQ8BCY,"I don't like this dvd, many routines have the same poses. I am not experiencing morning sickness, But some of their rountines made me nauseous. I really don't recommend this one.",1271808000,,178,4.774193548387097
3649563,4,B001IQ8BCY,"I bought this DVD early in my pregnancy (with some other workout DVDs) and finally started using it in my 3rd trimester. I am an intermediate yoga student and have been doing prenatal yoga on my own with the prenatal yoga deck since I became pregnant.

I love the different workout options provided, with the choice of a general option, energizing routine, or more specific routines targeted to the different pregnancy discomforts like lower back pain and more. I only wish I had used this DVD earlier in my pregnancy for the symptom reliefs!

As other reviewers have said, this is slow moving and not a fast paced DVD, but it does contain plenty of poses and time in each pose. I was frustrated by the flow as well as the other reviewers, because they change positions/props so much I ended up having to pause the DVD in between poses several times to move the mat, add a chair, or just change the general set-up to match the one in the video. It would have been nicer if they would have allowed for this prop-adjustment time in the DVD rather than just jumping between poses like they do. They do explain where the props should go as well as what to focus on in the pose. Despite these annoying transitions, I still think the workout was decent (slow paced but focused) and helpful and I think this DVD is worth it for all of the different workout options provided!

As for props, they use a yoga mat, folding chair (I used my coffee table as a substitute because all of my chairs have arms on them!), blanket, & bolsters (I used 2 of the dozen pillows from my bed).

The modifications to poses DO seem a bit excessive at times, but it is easy to adjust the modification according to your experience and comfort level. The modifications are reasonable and I appreciate that they are showing everything you can do to make the pose more comfortable and safe.",1270339200,5,1858,4.488165680473373
3649564,2,B001IQ8BCY,I'm not too sure about yoga but i have a hard time with this dvd. It's too slow for me and it doesn't transition smoothly from one pose to the next. I feel there are too many props needed.,1268611200,2,188,3.8461538461538463
3649565,2,B001IQ8BCY,"I only used this twice during my pregnancy. First of all you need other equipment such as blocks and bands that don't come with the dvd. Second, it goes waaaay too slow, even for a preggo! The instructor isn't pregnant, which to me would have made more sense. I'd feel more like ""Hey, she's pregnant and she can do this so I can too."" I didn't like this dvd at all. But to be fair, I didn't really give it much of a chance. I preferred the Prenatal Pilates DVD's much more and used them frequently.",1265155200,,498,4.197916666666667
3649566,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I ordered this DVD based on reviews by other people only to find that this is the worst possible DVD I have ever seen in my life. 6 minutes into the basic workout I had only done two poses. It isn't a routine either like most yoga workouts, it shows one pose for a few minutes and then ends that scene and goes to a completely different post. None of them flow together. One may be standing and the next one on the floor. I could not even believe what I was seeing. The next thing is that it's an older woman doing it. I was maybe expecting a pregnant person. The setting is horrible. It's in some estate looking home with a fire place and a baby grand piano in the background. I would not buy this dvd for any reason. You will get nothing out of it other than being totally bored. I don't see how anyone could make it through this dvd. Do not believe the other reviews or you will be totally disappointed unless you are looking for something to call a work out that is anything but that.",1264982400,,988,4.124352331606218
3649567,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I was soooooooooooooo disappointed with this DVD.  I used Shiva Rea in my first pregnancy and thought I'd try something different.  What a waste this was.  There are excessive props needed as well as a good a amount of free wall space, which I don't have.  The postitions do not change smoothly.  Instead the film is edited to cut to a new pose in which the model person magicaly reappears in a totally different postition with a different mat angle and different props.  This was just too cumbersome for me, especially as changing positions grows more difficult with my growing belly.  I kept trying this DVD but would grow so irritated with the changing angles that I could never get through a whole practice set. Save your money, get the Shiva Rea DVD instead.",1263686400,,763,4.649253731343284
3649568,1,B001IQ8BCY,"This is perhaps the worst prenatal workout I have ever done. It seemed so promising but it is not for anyone who is looking to actually practice yoga.
I was unable to get through any of the workouts because I was so bored. I feel as if this would be a great workout for a woman in her late 90's who has decided to try yoga for the first time in her life. I have yet to find a good prenatal yoga workout dvd but two that are all OK are Crunch Yoga Mama & Prenatal Pilates with Lizbeth Garcia.",1261180800,,491,3.92

3649571,5,B001IQ8BCY,"This video explains things very well in detail.  I took time to go over the whole video then start the yoga by trimaster.  I am working on the 2nd trimaster now and some of the movements were adjusted accordingly, so it's pretty safe.  Each execise runs in a slow paste so that it's very easy for me to follow.  I can choose the 25 minutes morning sickness relief execise, or 45 minutes hips & lower back execise, or 50 mitues energizer... There are so many choices for each trimaster.  I can see the different of how my body react if I execise or not.  I highly recommend to any pregnant lady who enjoys yoga during pregnancy.

3649572,3,B001IQ8BCY,"I was looking forward to a work out that has shorter and longer practices as well as specific workouts for certain complaints.  While I have only done one work out so far, I was not impressed.  You are constantly having to get up and down and change from sitting, to standing, to leaning against a wall and it just doesnt seem to flow at all. I'm in my 3rd tri so I don't know what the others are like, but it seems so ""soft"" and didn't really seem to do anything for me - like I said, i've only done one so far - and I would much rather do a work out that made me feel like i'd stretched and done something!

My one big gripe is that during each routine, they have me constantly moving my yoga mat back and forth between against the wall and perpendicular to the wall.  It sometimes feels like I'm spending more time moving my mat around than I am doing the poses.  Still, the routines are great for a novice like me, and my whole body feels great after I've completed a routine - something that I appreciate more and more as I get bigger and bigger.",1251676800,3,505,4.467391304347826
3649574,1,B001IQ8BCY,I was very disappointed with this video. Nearly all of the exercises call for props that i don't have. A huge number of the exercise require that you lean up against a wall or use a wall as a prop in some way and my living room isn't set up in a way that there is a wall for me to use. There are a few exercises that don't call for props/walls but so many that do that even attempting to do this video just zaps out all of my ambition to exercise in the first place. Also the cover of the video makes it look like a typical exercise video but it is different then normal because it isn't the instructor doing the exercise while she talks but a stiff looking model.,1250380800,,664,4.0

It is not a flow yoga DVD (ie fast and working up a sweat) - don't expect this. The routines are geared to addressing pregnancy issues such as fatigue and back pain rather than getting into perfect shape (Leisa Hart's ""Fit Mama"" is good also if you are looking for this. Right now it is about feeling healthy and feeling energized so this DVD really hits the spot for me. With 20 routines on it, there will be lots to do for most people - great value.

8311257,3,B001IQ8BCY,"The routines were a little strange, it seemed to require too many props, and it was too long and complicated for my taste.  I used a 10 minute Prenatal Pilates DVD that I loved instead of this one.",1434067200,,197,4.184210526315789

8311260,1,B001IQ8BCY,"This DVD is horrible.  It appears to have been filmed in the common room of a dorm at Smith.  The poses use the wall or chairs and treat you like you are geriatric rather than pregnant.  There is absolutely no pacing; she's up, she's down, and there's no transition between poses.  If you are absolutely new to yoga, this might be your speed.  Otherwise, try Element Prenatal and Postnatal Yoga or Hilaria Baldwin Fit Mommy-to-Be Prenatal Yoga.",1409961600,,444,4.714285714285714
8311261,3,B001IQ8BCY,"I love that this dvd has trimester-specific and symptom-specific routines. The instructor is gentle and easy to understand. However, I gave the dvd a three-star rating because I find it is so cumbersome to locate and use all the props as directed. I understand that you want to stable in the poses while pregnant, but having to use props is keeping me from using the dvd. I will probably be shopping for a simpler workout soon.",1401580800,,427,4.631578947368421
8311262,1,B001IQ8BCY,"I was very excited to order this DVD.  When I had a chance to finally try it out I found that only the introductions and advertisement portions worked, but the actual workouts only worked for the first couple minutes, then skipped or just froze.  It was not damaged as far as I could tell. Unfortunately, when I found this out it was too late to do a return.",1401148800,,358,4.25
