3118769,1,B0013PVGOU,"One of the WORST films ever. A real piece of Junk. It just rambles on. NOT FUNNY. One star is too much. It is like a really bad SNL skit that goes on for over an hour. It is just work to watch. In the beginning you think the film will lead to something if you give it a chance, but it doesn't.  You will wear out the fast foward button on your DVD controls, and turn it off before the end, because you won't care what happens next. I love B movies and even C movies, but this is way below them.  I will never trust the National Lampoon brand name again. Use the DVD is a frisbee and you will enjoy it more.",1263600000,,606,3.84
3118770,2,B0013PVGOU,"What a title !  Building expectations to something interesting....instead you get a disdainful pieeece. They tryed but failed miserably.  I forced my self to watch for maybe half the movie, but felt so cheated for the wasted time.  I could have been washing my toilet.  Very possibly the poorest result ever put out on film.",1253232000,,324,4.836363636363636
3118771,4,B0013PVGOU,"In 2077, a child by the name of Tex Kennedy is placed into a bunker, by himself, before the nukes hit that wipe about 98% of the world's population. In 2097, Tex Kennedy, a grown man now, emerges from the bunker with a mission. To help with the ruling of New America. With his trusty dysfunctional robots, he begins his search for the prophesized Benjamin Remington, the man that will be King of New America. Together, they will need to get to a radio tower to help unite the lone survivors of America. But the tower just happens to be in a certain part of America called, The Threshold of Hell. For some reason, the people here were protected by the blast. Some would think it might be magic, or maybe even the work of Satan. With the help of some unlikely friends, such as a Cannibal Sue and Javier Castro, they must get to the tower, before Benjamin's crazy brother, the Jackal.

The first time I began to watch this, I stopped probably 10 minutes in. I couldn't stand the coloring, and it just seemed very cheap. Then, thanks to me making myself watch all the movies I own in alphabetical order no matter what, I finally got to see this little gem. I honestly laughed quite a lot. Everyone is pretty funny, but Kevin Wheatley (Tex Kennedy) is very funny with his witty lines. The whole story is great, even though filled with plot holes and goofiness. This is definitely not the best movie ever, but for a B-Movie, that is pretty low budget, it's great. It really is. The characters were funny, and some were almost epic, for a movie like this. Even my friend who I was watching this with, who doesn't care for B movies that much, laughed quite a bit too. He said the movie was `Eh', but he still laughed. Also check out the Outtakes, some funny stuff there to. I liked when Tex and the two robots were running up a sandy hill, and one of the robots trips up the other robot and he hits face first into the sand, making them all trip each other up. I laughed pretty hard at that... hehe.

While the movie is low budget, and the story is pretty crazy, the movie was definitely a fun watch. I was definitely surprised. Just make sure you sit through the first 10 or 15 minutes. Give it some patience. Can't wait for the sequel (that they tease you with at the end)!

P.S. - My friend and I joked about how it looked like 95% of the movie was filmed in the same spot. Well I guess it was. IMDB says that most of it was filmed on the beaches of Pensacola, Florida. Man I miss living next door to Pensacola.",1243209600,4,2506,4.282700421940929

3118774,5,B0013PVGOU,"This is a great movie. The first time I saw it was a couple years ago at the Pensacola Film Festival. The whole cast and crew did a great job on creating this movie.
I'm very into keeping up with all the celebrity, movie, and tv news all the time. I like how the DVD shows all the hard work that goes into making a film.

Only thing I have a question about and maybe someone can help me, is a tech problem I keep having with the DVD. My 3rd copy just arrived yesterday and still having problems. When I put it in, it won't allow me to go to the menu. It keeps forcing me to watch like 15 minutes worth of previews first, and while going through the previews, the first 2 copies won't allow me to fast forward, stop, or pause it. Then keeps having problems with jumping really bad too in the movie itself.
The 3rd copy just arrived yesterday, and it will let me pause it, but the other things fast forward and stop not working. This happens on all the DVD players I have, and no other DVD's having any problems.

Thanks,
Amy",1219276800,2,1023,4.11
3118775,2,B0013PVGOU,"I found this movie to be pretentious, idiotic, and not at all funny. I caught myself wondering what sort of person could actually get intrigued by this. It's not tongue-in-cheek enough to be campy, and it's not subtle enough to be satire. It was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief and swallow the idea that this was happening in a far future devastated by nuclear warfare. I expected that at any given moment the camera would turn and reveal the entire film crew, complete with the director wearing a hawaiian shirt, sitting in his chair under a beach umbrella, and sipping a fancy cocktail. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The beginning animations were interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes it disintegrated towards total boredom. I couldn't last past 45 minutes. A complete waste of time. If you want a morbidly funny/bizarre post-apocalyptic movie, try Delicatessen.",1217030400,3,898,4.993333333333333

3118779,3,B0013PVGOU,"This is a goofy post-apocalyptic roller-coaster ride!  Low budget; a mish-mash nod towards the most well-known cliches of the genre, it nonetheless manages a fresh approach.  Yes, it is somewhat disjointed, with some head-scratching moments, but this kind of film isn't meant to be taken seriously at all (National Lampoon after all), and it's hard to tell if these rough edges are deliberate,\; due to budget constraints; or simply creative minds run amok.  The film would have been best served if they'd taken some of the most innovative moments--such as the seemingly random interjections of animation, and simply ran with it.  Rather than the few insertions contained in the film, it would have felt more deliberate--whether it was due to budget constraints or not to just go with it and use animation every time there was a dust up.  There were some admittedly few laugh out loud moments, but they were there, and it did manage to remain interesting 'til the end.  Your level of amusement depends on your own tastes.  If you like slap-stick with a liberal splash of fake blood, you'll like this. The acting was decent, not bad, not overdone--and the movie was entertaining overall.  Definitely a NEW approach to the whole idea of a new United States of America rising from the ashes, which makes it a cut above other low-budget films of this type.",1423440000,,1352,4.873362445414847

3118787,5,B0013PVGOU,"Beach Party At The Threshold Of Hell is a surreal post-apocalyptic comedy that is now lodged in my brain. I first saw this movie a couple of years ago and had an idea I was going to see the same ho hum end of the world scenario covered by so many other films (but maybe with a few laughs). Instead I got a  movie that does contain many familiar doomsday elements, but assembled in such a unique way that taken as a whole, everything became fresh and original. Like many of the 1 star reviewers here I felt the first 15 minutes or so were slow and confusing. Unlike them though I feel I could not fairly review a film I had not watched. So I stuck it out, and discovered an amazing and subtly funny new world order Heck this movie deserves 4 stars for totally avoiding the tired cliches of fighting over gasoline or water. I give it its fifth star for starting the story at the end of a 3,000 mile journey by foot. A walk we heard about briefly but were not forced to watch each agonizing step of.

3118796,5,B0013PVGOU,"One my favorite films. It manages to make one laugh while maintaining a unique and purposely ambiguous tone. Plus, its sharply-constructed visuals shine throughout. tBPatToH is a surprisingly blood-soaked dramedy that pulls no punches.

3118797,3,B0013PVGOU,"It appears as if National Lampoon attempted to create a cult classic by using some standard formula. However, it is the viewers who give cult status, not the makers of the film.

20 years after American is destroyed by bombs, people emerge from their shelters. While they were in their shelters they listened to the radio broadcast of one man who proclaimed himself king and his nephew (who is blind) to be his heir. A man named Tex Kennedy (Kevin Wheatley) along with 2 androids (Paul Whitty, Chandler Parker) with no real special effects seek out the nephew, Benjamin (Bill English) to fulfill the prophecy.

Meanwhile the lunatic son of the broadcaster with his small band of idiots seek Benjamin to kill him. Along their travels, Tex encounters ""Cannibal Sue"" whose Christian name is Cannibal Susan (Jamie Bullock) who they take with them, in a cage. The characters all come together at a beach party in Pensacola run by Satan, hence the title of the film.

There is blood, killing, language, and very brief nudity. New characters are introduced into the movie as it moves along by use of either flashbacks or a futuristic story teller (Richard Riehle) imitating Masterpiece Theater. At times I thought it was going to be a parody of Hamlet, then a satire of the 1960's, then simply a bad movie. It is not laugh out loud funny, but may make you smile.

I would recommend seeing ""A Boy and His Dog"" before watching this movie.",1281225600,,1429,4.704

3353293,5,B0013PVGOU,"One my favorite films. It manages to make one laugh while maintaining a unique and purposely ambiguous tone. Plus, its sharply-constructed visuals shine throughout. tBPatToH is a surprisingly blood-soaked dramedy that pulls no punches.

Who knew that Post-Apocalyptic cinema could be so damn funny?",1351209600,,298,5.7727272727272725
3353294,3,B0013PVGOU,"It appears as if National Lampoon attempted to create a cult classic by using some standard formula. However, it is the viewers who give cult status, not the makers of the film.

20 years after American is destroyed by bombs, people emerge from their shelters. While they were in their shelters they listened to the radio broadcast of one man who proclaimed himself king and his nephew (who is blind) to be his heir. A man named Tex Kennedy (Kevin Wheatley) along with 2 androids (Paul Whitty, Chandler Parker) with no real special effects seek out the nephew, Benjamin (Bill English) to fulfill the prophecy.

Meanwhile the lunatic son of the broadcaster with his small band of idiots seek Benjamin to kill him. Along their travels, Tex encounters ""Cannibal Sue"" whose Christian name is Cannibal Susan (Jamie Bullock) who they take with them, in a cage. The characters all come together at a beach party in Pensacola run by Satan, hence the title of the film.

There is blood, killing, language, and very brief nudity. New characters are introduced into the movie as it moves along by use of either flashbacks or a futuristic story teller (Richard Riehle) imitating Masterpiece Theater. At times I thought it was going to be a parody of Hamlet, then a satire of the 1960's, then simply a bad movie. It is not laugh out loud funny, but may make you smile.

I would recommend seeing ""A Boy and His Dog"" before watching this movie.",1281225600,,1429,4.704
8252561,5,B0013PVGOU,"Brilliant.

A mythically-scaled, homespun satire on the fate of mankind in post-apocalyptic North America.  All on a shoestring budget (and a broken shoestring at that), with some of the most hysterically psychopathic characters ever brought to screen.  My only wish was for backstory on some of the characters that didn't receive it.  This thing needed to be on the threshold of hell, because it's FUNNY AS HELL.

A choice part of my permanent collection (one of the few actual DVDs I own, since I usually purchase only BD/UHD BD).  Can't wait for the sequel (yeah, that will so happen).  Recommended if you like absurdist comedy.",1500163200,,631,4.9523809523809526

8252564,4,B0013PVGOU,"This off-t-misunderstood comedic gem just will not appeal to a much younger generation, since so many are hooked on devices which tell them when to think. Sad. But if you have some of the NL=s history to work with, then I'd say this film is worth a look. In a world of future time, after the BIG ONE hits, a new america is born. Horrendous amount of fake blood, some flavored with a few body parts, happily eaten by a female cannibal; this film has all the makings of despair. Until the sarcastic and occasionally off-putting ""wounds and injuries"", power struggle for kingship of new america begins. The rest, you will have to take my word that as this film trots along, some of the antics and well played humorous, even choreographed scenes do not disappoint. Remember, it's a spoofy, silly mess which you can feel good about laughing with.  Just when you think you've figured it all out, another scene, actor or line pops up and you have to start all over. Don't overthink it.
 **One Caution: Please don't allow any age children to watch this film, then write a review slamming everyone in it as demonic.
IF your kids watch it, even though you were warned out of kindness to and for YOU, the responsibility is yours,  not flyx's. NOT

 Producers, film crew, actors- NO!  It rests squarely upon your parental shoulders. **

This is similar to the old ""Airplane"" films, just not for smalls. (kids).

It's really, truly, just for fun.  You weren't doing anything, anyway.  :)",1450224000,,1474,4.634615384615385
