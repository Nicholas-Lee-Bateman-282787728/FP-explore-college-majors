8155258,5,B000KA17WU,"Where the Waters Run is an exciting video telling some of the magic of water which, instead of an evolutionary accident, is a magnificent design by God. Water has been called the elixer of life and it truly is. Water is essential and plays a key role in all plant life and animal life and human life. Even in the Bible the Lord Jesus Christ spoke of His own message as spiritual water of eternal life. Water is God's own design specialty and bears His stamp of being created by Him. The video presentation Where the Waters Run did a splendid job.",1417392000,,546,4.362745098039215

These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us.

8155260,4,B000KA17WU,"This is a Moody Science Classic, first produced in 1975.  This 28-minute DVD teaches us about water.  Why we need it, its composition, why it floats when most frozen substances sink, how water rises in the trunks of trees against the pull of gravity, the water cycle, etc.  A lot of good educational information, and I did learn several new things myself.  Besides, inspiring wonder and thankfulness at an important element of God's creation, the DVD also ended with a nice spiritual lesson at the end comparing the importance of water to physical life and the importance of living water in Christ.

However, I didn't enjoy this DVD as much as the other ones I've seen in this series.  The explanations, while decent, weren't as engaging and accessible as in the others.  They'd be fine for older children, but there was less that my 6-year-old could grasp than in the others.  I also don't enjoy this narrator like Dr. Irwin Moon in the older videos.  I thought the cinematography in this one actually seemed more dated than in some of those that were made in the 50s, maybe because of some of the very 70s bright colors?

Still, this is a nice educational DVD from a Christian perspective.  I'd rate this one 3.5 stars, which I'll round up to 4.  If you were only buying a few of the DVDs in this 19 DVD series of classics, I'd recommend others instead, but this is still worthwhile.",1260748800,2,1385,4.585365853658536
