6516965,1,B00LZS8Y7W,"Why do they make films with such poor acting. Like in chess, when defeat is inevitable, resign. The acting was so bad that the films sucked because of it. As I've said, one needs all the elements to work and if one can't do that, then quit making films please and spare us.",1414800000,3,273,4.169811320754717
