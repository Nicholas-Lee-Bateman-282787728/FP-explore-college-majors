8404677,5,B003SQW0ZQ,"I admit I have not given the book and CD the careful study to date as I planned, and need a Chirunning coach.

However, the joint warming up exercises Mr. Dreyer and his friends offer are quite effective, as are the balance and momentum discussions.  I am also well pleased with the information they offer regarding diet and the more specific comments on pain management for when one is moving down the trail.

I intend to give this method the attention it deserves, as my work thus far convinces me that the ergonomics of Chirunning can help me even more in my slow distance as much as they have helped me in my sprints.

As for the works themselves, the book is well concieved and clearly written, and the CD (Vol. 1) is extremely informative.  My only complaint about the CD is that I cannot find a Vol. 2.",1354320000,,809,4.402684563758389
