6428349,5,B00KHA8992,"The Toy Story of Terror short film has a runtime of approximately 21+ minutes.  It's a quality production with an interesting Halloween-time story, focusing on Jessie and the gang's unplanned stay at a roadside motel.  The original ""commercials"" that aired with Toy Story of Terror are featured at the end of the film, spoofs of Combat Carl as a GI Joe style infomercial, a short on the Old Timer clock, and finally the ""Transitron"" transformer-style robot in a Japanese-style commercial.  Each commercial has a runtime of about 60 seconds.  Overall, it's a fun collection for true Toy Story fans.

As a bonus, three Toy Story Toons are included, Hawaiian Vacation (6 min.), Small Fry (8 min.), and Partysaurus Rex (7 min.).  These are great shorts and add some value to the purchase if you do not already have them.

Finally, included is a behind the scenes feature with the director giving a look at the day-to-day work to make a Toy Story short.",1408406400,35,948,4.779141104294479
6428350,4,B00KHA8992,"Pixar takes the same kind of pride and care with their Toy Story characters as Walt Disney did with his beloved Mickey Mouse. Toy Story of Terror is a perfect example. This 21-minute Halloween special debuted on ABC-TV on October 16, 2013, but it stars all of the original voice talents and features the same energy, inventiveness and attention to detail as we got in the three big Toy Story movies. Whats more, with this release the Pixar bunch continues with their playful brand of self-reflexive filmmaking. Is it too scary for young children? Not really, because of Mr. Pricklepants' humorous undercutting of the characters' fears via a running commentary about horror conventions, and also because the big reveal comes fairly early in the film. Some will say that the plot too closely resembles Toy Story 2, but it strikes me as a fun variation on what toys might find horrific about a motel, and also finds humor in what parents know for a fact: toys can easily get lost in a hotel room. Dont be put off by the short runtime. Toy Story of Terror is full of jokes, gags, and allusions that adults and older siblings will love. But its also designed for young children, with a core message about believing in yourself and, as the old Nike commercials proclaimed, just doing it!

6428351,3,B00KHA8992,"I definitely enjoyed this Halloween special when it aired but seems a bit expensive considering you are only getting 22 minute feature and three even shorter Toy Story Toons... they could have given us a multitude of things to fill this out and make it a great package but, unfortunately Disney does not operate that way.",1406851200,20,321,4.75
6428352,5,B00KHA8992,"Anything Toy Story is a hit in my house. This was recorded and played over and over and over for most of Halloween and Christmas. I am so happy to finally have a hard copy (I lived in fear of the DVR frying and losing it!). Yes, it can be scary but if you have a Toy Story fan in the house, this is a must have for the collection. As well done as any of the movies and just as funny -- for adults as much as kids.",1406160000,3,413,3.651685393258427
6428353,5,B00KHA8992,I thought I saw on Amazon a few months ago that there was going to be a 3D release of this title. Am I dreaming?,1404000000,,112,3.52
6428354,5,B00KHA8992,"I saw Toy Story of Terror when it aired on TV back in 2013 and loved it. I was really happy the main cast returned to voice the toys for a 30 minute show. Now for anyone looking for something really scary should know right off the bat that this won't be like the scary movies you see in theaters, it has more of a Scooby Doo feel to it where someone/something goes missing and they got to find out what's going on.

There are references to events from the Toy Story movies and an we're introduced to a character I personally like named Combat Carl, voiced by Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from the Rocky movies)

I'm looking forward to the Blu-Ray release, and I suggest anyone who is a Toy Story fan, you'll want to add this to your collection",1402704000,25,742,4.25531914893617
6428355,5,B00KHA8992,"We saw this as a special on television and absolutely loved it (keep in mind we are a family of adults).

6428357,5,B00KHA8992,"Some of my best childhood memories, and favorite stories to tell while reminiscing with family members during get-togethers, are those times when a movie or TV show scared the daylights out of me. My poor Mom took me and my sister to see ""Psycho"" during it's initial run in theaters in 1960, I believe. I was 6 years old at the time and loved ""monster"" movies, and ""scary"" movies. She, and my sister and I, had no idea what we were in for. The original ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a grim, gut-wrenching hour and a half that left me and the rest of the Saturday afternoon matinee kids shell-shocked when I was about 13 or 14 years old.

I watched ""Toy Story of Terror"" during its run on the Disney Channel during the Halloween season with my grownup children, and with a 5- and 8-year old brother and sister foster kids. Needless to say, we all loved it, and the little ones wanted to watch it each time it was broadcast. Sure it was scary, but in a ""Scooby-Do"" kind of way, and that's the fun of it. I will be ordering at least two copies of ""Toy Story of Terror,"" one for the kids and one for me. If you love the ""Toy Story"" gang, you'll love this one, too!",1401062400,72,1161,4.20627802690583

6428388,3,B00KHA8992,Arg! Why amazon is there not a loop feature for just the cartoon and NOT the extras? I would rather have the dvd than deal with all the bonus stuff. My son wants to watch these over and over again and is toy story obsessed. This and the other toy story shorts both have bonus stuff and there is not a loop feature for just the movie. Irritating. Cartoon itself is cute and fun but my complaint is the format. Dvd would be better. It at least just play feature button would be nice.,1519516800,,481,4.127659574468085

It's sure not easy overcoming your inner demons, just ask Jessie and her box-phobia! Both the DVD and Blu-ray contain a bunch of bonus features, like commercials made just for this release, audio commentaries on the feature program and 3 Toy Story Toons, and more! The separate Blu-ray disc has deleted scenes, that aren't on the DVD. Luckily, this classic is only Scooby Doo spooky, hence the TV-G rating, or you'd have to make your kids boycott this special!

It makes fun of horror movies and horror conventions while also using brilliant story telling, and uses a group of vintage toys as a sort of team of specialists Ala mission impossible. Combat Carl, a name mentioned in Toy Story as their version of GI Joe, makes an appearance as a key character (Although eagle-eyed Pixar Nerds like me will notice the Combat Carl in this is black while the one in Toy Story is White. Obviously, like GI Joes, there are different versions of Combat Carl.) And the commercials included are amazing! I definately recommend watching it first with the commercials. As for the Shorts, it has Hawaiian Vacation, Small Fry, and one I haven't seen before: Partysaurus Rex, which is AWESOME in High Definition (you may want to turn your volume down in some spots. It gets pretty loud!) All in all, a fun time for and Pixar Nut or Toy Story fanatic.  The biggest complaint I have is I wish they hadn't put the menu in black and white!!!

Who is behind the mysterious disappearances? It mainly falls to Jessie to find out, her brave front already shattered from an earlier experience on the road. Luckily, she'll have the help of Combat Carl and his friends.

Okay, I'm gonna address this television special first, and then the Blu-Ray release itself, which is getting some unfair runtime complaints I'll talk about in a minute. The special itself is excellent. It looks gorgeous, complete Toy Story theatrical quality, and it's a fun little story. The more recent special, Toy Story That Time Forgot, may be a little better storywise (it has a more epic feel, but then it's a different kind of story), but this one is still very good. It pulls off everything it's trying to, and my only complaint about it is that it's meant to be a Halloween special. This is my pet peeve when it comes to holiday specials. If they have nothing to do with the actual holiday, it's very disappointing for me. Toy Story of Terror is a great little Toy Story featurette, but I wish they'd made it an actual Halloween-themed program and not just trying to link it with the horror film theme. About halfway through, it feels less like a horror film and more like a typical toy story adventure anyway, so even that is a weak link. That's not that it's a weak story, just weakly linked to Halloween. In fact, there is no mention of the holiday at all. Toy Story That Time Forgot fairs a little better in this regard as a Christmas special, but still not what a viewer is truly hoping for when they sit down for a Christmas special. And, well, we need more Halloween specials, so that makes it a bit more disappointing. However, again, I'm not saying this special disappoints in any other way. It is excellent. I just hope we see another Toy Story Halloween special someday that actually shows some of that great suburbia Halloween atmosphere that makes the best Halloween stuff so darn good. That single complaint being hammered in, I really think this special is awesome as a new Toy Story adventure, and the quality is up there with all the other toy story stuff. Plus, it's great that we're getting to know Molly's other toys better with these new specials, not to mention getting to meet new characters. I already have added Pez Cat (from this special) to my collection of Toy Story replicas, ha.

How about the Blu-Ray though? What is everyone complaining about? Simple. They're stupidly buying something without researching or even taking a look at what they're buying at all. They're complaining that a Disney Blu-Ray (with digital copy) is costing them 13.88 (I caught this on sale and paid a bit less, but even still), yet only runs about 22 minutes. They're also complaining that it has behind the scenes features! What?! Oh my god, what is wrong with you people?!!!

Okay, first, if you ever have bought Disney blu-rays, you know it's pretty amazing to find any for less than 19.99 outside of release week. There have been some changes in this recently, granted, with some of the less popular classics getting big price drops, but that's mainly because most people who want them already have them. For the most part, getting a Disney blu-ray of a half-hour TV special, well, anything under 15 bucks sounds about right, and Suggested Retail Price is still probably 19.99 (as for the features the SRP is much higher). If you still wanna complain that it's not worth it, well, you really have no excuse to, because the info is all right on the package. Look, if you're just looking for a babysitter rather than high def, great quality programming adults and kids both can enjoy together (and yes, you're paying partly for the beautiful, theatrical quality of this original special over some cheap DVD of low budget TV show episodes randomly mashed together in a themed volume), then may I direct you to the 5 dollar DVD section? Beautifully made featurettes with excellent bonus features are clearly not for you. Reading some of the negative reviews on here have me totally disgusted and thinking, ""So you folks are the problem? The reason we hardly get any good bonus features anymore, and so many releases are practically bare bones or have very superficial bonus features!"" I was so happy to see the bonus features on these specials! This is what DVDs and Blu-Rays were meant for! If you're not a true fan and collector, the right thing for you is the digital download. We real fans want those behind the scenes featurettes and fun, fake toy commercials! The bonus features on Toy Story of Terror really go above and beyond, especially for a television special release!

Toy Story of Terror includes deleted scenes with optional director intros, fake vintage toy commercials with optional intros, a great behind the scenes featurette, bonus shorts with optional commentaries (that is fantastic!) and a commentary track for the main attraction as well! This is one fantastic release and well worth the price! Those phony vintage commercials are always a hoot, and I'm always happy to get more shorts. I'm puzzled that anyone would complain about the runtime when three more Toy Story shorts are included, but it seems pretty obvious some people bought this thinking it was a feature length film. Arrgh!!! Why do you buy things you know NOTHING about, don't even bother to read the package first, and then feel you have the right to complain about stuff clearly laid out for you in advance?!!! Why would anyone buy any Blu-Ray or DVD without reading the back of the packaging even a little bit? We even used to do that much before we rented a movie, let alone purchasing one! Okay, enough of that rant. As for the shorts, you get Small Fry, in which a kids' meal version of Buzz switches places with the real Buzz for a chance to get out of the restaurant display case and actually get played with for a change. Very cute and funny, plus a special appearance by old Disney character Condorman, ha. That was a nostalgic treat, and extra fun since a lot of us are all too familiar with kids' meal toys. Then there's Hawaiian Vacation, which is the one I remember seeing on the big screen the most, though I still don't remember which feature it accompanied. Oh, wait, Cars 2, no wonder I didn't remember. It's about Barbie and Ken wanting to take a Hawaiian Vacation and have their first kiss. When they stowaway in the wrong place, they miss their flight and the rest of the gang has to create a virtual vacation for them! This one is great fun, as Barbie and Ken always are. Finally, there's Partysaurus Rex, in which Rex finally gets to be the life of a party when he's taken to join in bathtime and then left behind with the hard partying bath toys. Rex takes over a sudsy rave party that gets out of control! It's a funny, high energy short that sorta has an adult theme (with the rave subject), but is still kept totally kid friendly, no worries there. Like the television featurettes, all these theatrical shorts keep that great Toy Story quality standard and all the surviving original voice cast, which is highly impressive considering some of the big name stars involved! And, sure, I had all these shorts already, I believe, on the releases of the theatrical films they originally accompanied, but it is great to have them all together on one Toy Story-themed blu-ray. Not worth the money? No way! This Blu-Ray is a fantastic package of superb material! Disney and Pixar at their best!",1446940800,,7764,4.673245614035087

6428901,5,B00KHA8992,"Last year, I was all excited about the premier of Toy Story of TERROR!, but for some reason I didn't especially care for it.  However, I decided to watch it again this year when it was on TV this year, and I wound up really enjoying it.  Now, Im at a bit of a loss to figure out why I felt the other way.

This half hour special is from the people at Disney/Pixar and includes the original cast back to voice their characters.  While not all the characters are back, we get a good chunk of the old and new characters as they accompany Bonnie (voiced by Emily Hahn) on a road trip.  When her moms car gets a flat tire in the middle of a rainstorm, they pull into a nearby motel in the middle of nowhere until they can get it repaired in the morning.

The toys have been watching a scary movie in the trunk, and Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton), who is an expert on them, continues to warn the toys of the dangerous things that can happen.  But instead, the gang wants to explore the room where they are spending the night.  Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) is the first to vanish followed quickly by Rex (Wallace Shawn), Pricklepants, Trixie (Kristen Schaal), Woody (Tom Hanks), and Buzz (Tim Allen).  With only Jessie (Joan Cusack) free, it is up to her to save her friends.  But where are they?  And can she face one of her biggest fears to save the day?

Maybe my expectations last year were too high, and I was expecting a full movies story in 22 minutes (got to factor in commercials).  Watching it this year, I was actually surprised at how quickly the story moved.  Theyve got time for lots of action and some nice character development in that time.  And we cant leave out the humor since there are several good laughs along the way.

Actually, I mention character development, but really only Jessie gets any significant development.  Dont get me wrong, the rest of the cast is their usual charming selves, but it is Jessie that has to overcome her fear of being left in a box.  Yes, so it is predictable, but still, it is nice to see this weakness brought up again and faced over the course of the story.

Despite have Terror in the name, I don't think this will truly scare kids.  Yes, the toys are watching an old fashioned vampire film early on, but there are so many laughs with the characters reactions to it, Im not sure it would scare them.  The only really scary thing might be the weird thing grabbing the toys, but once that is explained, Im not sure that would scare kids for long.  I don't think it would have scared me as a kid, but I think youll only need to worry if you have super sensitive kids.

While the animation doesnt include any of the beautiful money shots we normally get from a Pixar film, it is certainly up to telling this story.  The voice cast, new and old, does a great job bring their characters to life.

So if you somehow missed Toy Story of TERROR!, fix that today.  Its a fun story that you will enjoy as long as you aren't as stupid as I was last year.",1434758400,,2997,4.278863232682061

The ""shorts"" that come with it are also available on other Disney DVD's so I actually have all of them already.  My 3 year old twin boys love it and will watch it over and over, and I'm sure will for years to come.

It would have been better if they had gone ahead and made this into a full length feature, but this is okay, too.  The story is that Jessie, Woody, Buzz, and a few of their toy buddies are traveling with Bonnie and her mother.  When they stop at a motel for the night, Woody warns the other toys that it's really easy for toys to get left behind at a motel, so they'd all better stay in Bonnie's suitcase.  Of course, they don't listen....  So begins the adventure where the toys disappear one by one, and it's a race to get everybody back in time to leave with Bonnie.  We are introduced to some new toy friends, including Combat Carl, a GI Joe type toy who teaches us how to cough safely as a bonus.  I hope Carl will become a regular.  This is all done with the usual Pixar attention to quality and detail--it's just shorter.",1419206400,,944,4.293785310734464

Obviously, the kids were completely bored with all this and everyone was very disappointed. The price was ridiculous for a 20 minute show. When we bought it, the description was not clear that this was only a short show and then a bunch of interviews to fill out the rest of the hour.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: I always get super excited and psyched up when a new PIXAR animation film comes out. They've made us laugh, cry, and have even thrilled us on occasion. But rarely have they tried to frighten us, let alone make a horror movie. But for Halloween in 2013 PIXAR released a thirty minute short film, featuring everyone's favourite toys from the 'Toy Story' franchise on US primetime television, but sadly not in the UK. And it certainly did not disappoint everyone in America. Plus, it was so much fun to see what the geniuses over at PIXAR could do with a horror movie.

Every toy is back this time around including Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head, as well as some newcomers. But what really sells this short besides the excellent script and voice acting, are the numerous horror movie references throughout the 22-minute runtime. You can tell that writer/director Angus MacLane (an animator for PIXAR since 'A Bug's Life'), is as huge fan of horror and science fiction movies. With new toys such as Combat Carl (voiced by Carl Weathers of course), Transitron, a PEZ cat, and shape-shifting LEGOs, Angus MacLane uses these new toys to their fullest ability that packs some great laughs and some genuinely creepy moments.

A flat car tyre strands Bonnie [Emily Hahn] and her mother [Lori Alan] at a creepy, small motel for the night, due to the tow truck company not being open until morning. In the car with Bonnie are Woody [Tom Hanks], Buzz [Tim Allen], Jessie [Joan Cusack], Mr. Potato Head [Don Rickles], Rex [Wallace Shawn], Mr. Pricklepants [Timothy Dalton], and Trixie [Kristen Schaal]. As the group locates their room and settles in for the night, the toys come awake and feel like exploring their surroundings. But soon enough some unseen monster starts capturing each toy one by one, until it's just Jessie left to find her friends before morning.

During her search, Jessie meets up with some new toys, one of them being Combat Carl [Carl Weathers], a big GI Joe looking guy with his miniature version Combat Carl Jr., which makes for some excellent comedy. Little does Jessie know that the motel manager is an Ebay seller [Stephen Tobolowsky] who has his pet iguana around him at all times? But now it is up to Jessie and her new friends to save the day and be back in their room before morning. It was a good move to have Jessie the main heroine here. Jessie struggles with her own nightmares and hang-ups in order to save her friends and must overcome her greatest fear to survive.

All children and adults alike will love this film, as there are some laugh out loud moments and some excellent horror movie Easter eggs for the older generation. As always, the voice talent here is top notch, and adding Carl Weathers to the cast is simply perfect. I hope Pixar continues to release these holiday themed shorts throughout the year with their other franchises, because Toy Story Of Terror! hits all of the right notes 100%.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Toy Story Of Terror! is as every bit of excellent as you've come to expect from a PIXAR/Disney release. It has a glorious 1080p ultra image transfer presented in 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The detail of this animation is perfect. Every inch of screen is completely detailed from the stains on the walls of the seedy motel to the textures on the toys' cloth costumes. Every stitch is crystal clear and vivid. Even in the darker scenes, which this short film has a considerable amount of, looks impressive, and never leaves you in the dark. The edges are very crisp and organic. There are some shots that actually look realistic. It looks that good. The colours simply pop out of screen at all times and are well balanced and bright. The black levels are very deep and inky with no crush whatsoever. There were no instances of any banding or aliasing to speak of, which is difficult to say for an animated film, but PIXAR does it up right. This video presentation is totally amazing and would be even more improved if they had brought it out in 3D?

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This release comes with an impressive lossless 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix that sounds robust, full, and loud. PIXAR uses all of the favoured horror genre sounds here to perfection, which should make you happy. The dialogue is always crystal clear and easy to understand, and is perfectly situated on the centre channel. There is some excellent directionality here as well. The sound effects and creepy voices and noises can be heard from the surrounds nicely, and puts you in the centre of the action. You might even begin to look over your shoulder or around your room to see if that was a real noise or not. These sound effects are life-like and pack a good punch. Ambient noises can be heard too and sound great. The fun and eerie score always adds to the entertainment of the movie and never drowns out any dialogue or sound effect. The surround effects are superb and the dynamic range is very wide here, leaving the audio presentation something to marvel over.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary withDirector Angus McLane, Director of photography Ian Megibben and Editor Axel Geddes: Here we get a breakdown of this special Blu-ray, scene by referential scene, noting the Easter eggs and classic film references tucked away in Toy Story of Terror! They also discuss the story and characters and  paying particular attention to Jesse's arc as a horror heroine, the new heroes and villains they've introduced to the Toy Story universe and just about every little titbit and in-joke a fan could hope for.

Special Feature: Team of Specialists [1080p] [12:00] This day-in-the-life of Angus MacLane soon gives way to a production feature that covers the development of the special, the creation of new Toy Story characters, animation and effects, and the staff meetings his team holds to guide shots from the storyboard stage to editorial. We get to see everything from research, and even a small conversation with Michael Giacchino, the composer of the shorts music and composer of scores for films such as UP and The Incredibles.

Special Feature: Toy Story Toons [1080p] [19:00] While ""Hawaiian Vacation,"" ""Small Fry"" and ""Partysaurus Rex"" have already been released in high definition via previous PIXAR Blu-ray releases, their inclusion here gives each short's filmmakers a chance to chime in thanks to a trio of optional audio commentaries.

Special Feature: Vintage Toy Commercials [1080p] [4:00] The special's hilarious vintage commercials are ""Old Timer,"" ""Combat Carl"" and ""Transitron"" which can be played with Toy Story Of Terror! which can be accessed individually from the Bonus Features Menu, or viewed with director introductions.

Deleted Scenes [1080p] [7:00] Three unfinished deleted scenes are available, which include ""Pencil Topper Trilogy,"" ""Travel Brochures"" and ""Road Trip Roulette"" and each with an optional introduction by Alex Geddes.

D23 Teaser [1080p] [1:00] Toy Story Of Terror! promo from D23. This little teaser was shown at the 2013 D23 EXPO, following the first 10 minutes of the short. Its nothing really major, but definitely makes you wonder what youll see and the good thing is, they keep so much of the juicy stuff not shown!

Finally, Toy Story Of Terror! is quite a fun film, and an excellent addition to the PIXAR and 'Toy Story' universe. The references to other horror classics are hilarious and great, and the fact that they used Jessie as the main hero here was fantastic. The video and audio presentations are both demo quality while the extras are all worth watching. And I'm glad that Disney is aware that they are selling a 22-minute film, therefore the price is very reasonable. If you are a fan of PIXAR animation, like I am, then this is one very entertaining short film you will want to add to your Blu-ray collection and the bonus features are also a total MUST! Very Highly Recommended!

The addition of the character Combat Carl to the Toy Story universe was awesome (great voice work by Carl Weathers).

It also comes with some neat fake toy commercials and the entire Toy Story Toons collection (Small Fry, Hawaiian Vacation and Partysaurus Rex).  These short episodes are simiply charming and continue the Toy Story universe in a good way.

Beautiful picture and sound quality involving Disney's now classic Toy Story characters in a ""haunted"" setting with all the snappy dialogue and humor we've come to expect from these guys. In this Disney short [21 minutes long, originally shown as a half-hour Halloween special on ABC in 2013] the toys are taken on a road trip, at night, in the rain, with Bonnie and her mom to visit Bonnie's grandma. Following a flat tire that forces them to stop for the night at a roadside motel, one of the toys goes missing, and the others are caught up in a series of mysterious and terrifying events as they search for their lost buddy.

We initally had it on the DVR, but darling hubby accidentally deleted it... after many conversations about what a horrid thing that would be, no less!  An accidental slip of the finger, the wrong button pressed, and our little man in tears because there was no more ""Special Woody"" available.  We were in such a panic I even contacted a friend who knows someone who works at Pixar... no luck.  Darn corporate policy.  But we did get word that this would be released to DVD shortly, so all was not totally lost.  Thank goodness!  After many, many, many days of explaining that Special Woody was broken and not available, our pre-ordered DVD was in hand.  It might as well been little man's birthday, it was that big of a deal.

The movie is cute - set after the movies.  The cast is on a road trip.  Nefarious hijinks ensue.  Good wins in the end.  I honestly think the material is a bit older kid/adult oriented (particularly the bit at the end), but the little man loves this one.",1410739200,4,1013,4.440217391304348

These 4 short films (one is a little over 20 minutes) all take place after the events of Toy Story 3 - you get a glimpse of what life is like with Bonnie, which is wonderful. Lots of highlights (""Predator"" homage from actor Carl Weathers, Jane Lynch as ""Neptune,"" references to classic horror films) and fantastic new characters. I loved Mini Buzz,  and Combat Carl seriously needs his own movie - c'mon Pixar, let's make this happen. ""Combat Carl never gives up. Combat Carl finds a way."" :) The highlight is the final cartoon - Partysaurous Rex will get your kids shaking their booties, if they aren't rolling on the floor with laughter, of course. One small warning - the first half of the first film, Toy Story of Terror, might be a little intense for your youngest children. I recommend keeping a happy face and laughing a little after the scary parts, quietly telling them that the characters will all be okay.",1410652800,,978,4.52542372881356

6429341,3,B00KHA8992,"This is a cute film short, but it's important to note that it is a made-for-TV special, so it's only 22 minutes. I personally think it would have been a lot better if they made this twice as long, for a full hour TV special instead of just a half hour. The whole thing feels very rushed - it's over before you realize it. The editor even said in the deleted scenes section that they had to trim things they didn't want to for time. And on that note I should mention it's a good thing they added some special features like deleted scenes to add more bulk to the Blu-ray & DVD. If it weren't for that this wouldn't even be worth $10. The 3 ""Toy Story Toons"" they mention on the cover are:
- Hawaiian Vacation
- Small Fry
- Partysaurus Rex
It's important to note that Hawaiian Vacation and Small Fry are both on the Pixar Short Films Collection 2, so it's not like these are all unreleased shorts. Partysaurus Rex might be new and not previously released... I had never seen it before this Blu-ray, and I have all 3 Toy Story movies on Blu-ray which have other shorts on them. I think Partysaurus Rex is a really fun little short! They really did a good job with the music and lighting on it to pull off a bathroom dance party vibe... if that could be a thing. haha I don't have kids but I hang out with kids a lot and I think a lot of kids and adults would enjoy these shorts.

So in short (pun intended), this is a cute little TV special with some bonus features, but don't expect a lot of content. That's really the only reason I gave it 3 stars... if Disney/Pixar put twice as much material on here it would easily be 5 stars in my opinion. Give us more for our money next time, Disney! (You can also apply this to Disney World, and the new Marvel releases where you only get a single disc DVD or Blu-ray for $20-30!! [My complaint being that if you want a digital copy you have to shell out more money for the 3D Blu-ray release... really not consumer-friendly cost-wise!]).

6429343,5,B00KHA8992,"I decided to buy the digital copy because my little ones make a mess with the blue-rays/DVDs!

Plus I also have my tablet with the Amazon instant video app, etc. So it was more convenient for me this way.

The content itself is wonderful! We love Toy Story, ever since it first came out as kid myself, I'm so glad my kids can also enjoy it now! The Toy Story of Terror is awesome! It's not that scary, I have toddlers that watch all the time and love it! (2yr old boy & 3yr old girl). Then the additional stuff is great too! The additional 3 short stories are cool, they show it sometimes on the Disney Jr. channel so my kids have seen them but it's great to have them as well. The other part of the video include behind the scenes, extra commercials of the toys from the story Toy Story of Terror, Combat Carl, etc.

So overall, a great addition to your Toy Story collection! Will definitely love more stories like this! Keep it up Pixar/Disney!!",1410220800,,1110,4.206572769953052
6429344,5,B00KHA8992,"This was very good from picture to sound to the actual Toy Story of Terror!

The extras were, for almost the first time, worth it to me. I enjoyed the deleted scenes and the 'commercials' were cute and enjoyable as well.

The main 'feature' concentrated on Jessie which I think is a good thing as I find her character a very interesting and slightly undeveloped one.

About the only thing wrong was the running time - it was just a little short even with the 3 Toy Story Toons. I think that the 'main feature' would have benefited with 1 or 2 of the deleted scenes. It, contrary to most things I watch, would have been nearly perfect if it had been 10 to 15 minutes longer! Total run time was a little over an hour.

It was so good I didn't want it to end!

I would rate this a very high 9.25 to 9.75 out of 10. And if it had been a little longer I would have added an extra 0.25 points.

HIGHLY recommended!",1410134400,,908,4.101694915254237

Unfortunately I was expecting for 14.99 a hour long lineup of new shorts. Not 1 new short and 50 minutes of credits, reviews, and 3 other shorts I had already purchased. I wish I could get my money back. :(

If you have not purchased all of the other shorts this might be a good buy but good luck getting your kid to sit through the BS. Thanks PIXAR!!!!",1409875200,7,458,4.170454545454546

It may entertain the toddler set; but for those of us (i.e adults) who expect far more from Toy Story - I suggest skipping this one.",1409788800,,331,4.354838709677419

6429375,4,B00KHA8992,"One of my main concerns when getting this movie was just HOW scary is it?  I have two young nephews ages 8 and 11 who love the Toy Story movies, but I don't want to get a call from their mom tomorrow about how they ran into her room at 4:00 am screaming because of nightmares after watching a scary movie with me.  But I don't think that will be an issue with this movie.  While it certainly fulfills the Toy Story of Terror! title expectations, it is scary in a way that kids can handle.  Where everything works out in the end and nothing truly horrific happens.

My only issue with this purchase would be the price.  It is priced about the same as a full length movie but is only 22 minutes long with a few short films and extras also available on the disk.  I could keep them occupied and entertained for 2 or 3 hours with a full length film for the same price as this that would only keep them busy for half an hour or so.",1409270400,3,926,4.054945054945055

6429380,4,B00KHA8992,"Just in time to get geared up for the Halloween season, Disney brings Pixar's ""Toy Story of Terror"" to Blu-ray and DVD. Loaded with all sorts of horror genre references, it's a must-see for any fright fans with kiddos too small to enjoy scarier fare during the holiday. I actually enjoyed this 22-minute short more than I did any of the actual movies.

Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and the rest of the gang go on vacation with Bonnie and her mother. The curious toys decide to explore a mysterious roadside hotel when their car's tire blows out. They find themselves captured by the owner of the inn and put up on the internet to be sold to the highest bidder. When Woody is bought, the rest must come to his rescue before he's shipped out via mail. They face perilous adventures and a dangerous ""creature"" along the way.

Toy Story of Terror is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) and English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The video perfectly emphasizes the precise animation Pixar is known for. The picture is vibrant and clean and matches the quality of the full-length films. All the creepy sounds youd expect from a Halloween special jump out at you thanks to the surround format.

Disney packs the Blu-ray edition of Toy Story of Terror full of exciting bonus material. Three Toy Story Toons entitled Hawaiian Vacation, Small Fry, and Partysaurus Rex are found. Never-Before-Seen special features include vintage toy commercials, deleted scenes, audio commentary and introductions, D23 teaser, and a featurette called Team of Specialists.

Although Toy Story of Terror is rated G, there might be some scary moments for younger children and possibly older ones as well. My 13-year-old daughter jumped at one scene and almost flung her ice cream all over the place. Between a lizard trying to eat Woody and other tense moments, it really might be too much for toddlers to take.

Toy Story of Terror is a perfect way to get ready for the Halloween season. It might be a month out, but it can never be too early to start the celebration. Although the actual feature presentation is only 22-minutes long, the addition of three additional cartoons and the special features make this a must-have for anyones Disney home entertainment library.",1409184000,2,2247,4.8871391076115485
6429381,4,B00KHA8992,"My 3 yr. old loves Toy Story and Halloween so we had to get this. It's not scary and the humor is for kids and adults. My only complaint is that it's really short, but I was aware of that when I bought it.",1409097600,,205,3.6818181818181817
6429382,5,B00KHA8992,"When you start to play your Toy Story of TERROR! disc, be sure to choose to watch it with the commercials. Youll be glad you did. This was an ABC TV special last yearthe first Pixar TV special everand it was constructed to break for commercials. So for the Blu-ray, Pixar included the ones they created especially for the show.

Sure, this is a great for Halloween watching, complete with a cheesy black-and-white Saturday drive-in style movie (love that puff of smoke!), but its also year round fun for Toy Story fans, as it could be thought of as an unofficial sequel"" to Toy Story. Many of the characters introduced in that film are here again, and they get more screen time, like Mr. Pricklepants, the self-appointed movie expert (you can almost see Marshall McLuhan making a cameo to contradict him, &aacute; la Annie Hall).

The 22 minutes focus mostly on Jessie, which is welcome. Shes a character with a lot of layers and audience empathy. Who among would want to be shut into a suitcase or box? The others characters are supportive in their various ways. One just wants to watch them do things together for as long as possible.

In this story, they find themselves at a creepy old motel with a manager hiding creepy secrets, but don't worry about it being kid-friendly, its not Psycho, though  nods to numerous suspense conventions abound. Theres a lot packed into this special.

The three Toy Story Toons included on the Blu-ray alone are worth having, since they in effect are follow-ups to the Toy Story films. Michael Keaton and Jodi Benson walk away with Hawaiian Vacation, Rex gets his time to shine in Partysaurus Rex (a stunner in high-def), and the characters have to grapple with their happy meal identities in Small Fry. Everything in this package is highly rewatchable.

The original movie voices are here, including Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack and Don Rickles, plus Carl Weathers voicing Combat Carl, a G.I. Joe type action figure with the fierce intensity of Liam Neeson (Hurry! Theres no time!) and the tendency to speak in third person like Regis Philbin likes to.

There's even audio commentary (thank you!)",1409097600,45,2139,4.796195652173913

6429386,3,B00KHA8992,Enjoyable disk although show should be longer. There is an audio drop out problem at approximately 59 sec to one minute point when Pickle Pants is speaking. This must be an inherent problem as I returned my original disk and received a replacement which had the same problem. I tried it on two different blu-ray players with the same result. Would be interested in hearing if others had the same problem.,1408752000,,404,4.704225352112676
6429387,4,B00KHA8992,This is an extremely cute story and an excellent addition to your movie collection if you love Toy Story or have a Toy Story obsessed  child like I do. It is however a little light on content with only the short story that aired as a part of Halloween special in 2013 and three even shorter stories that were played before a few Disney movies when they were in theaters; it would have been great to have a new short cartoon or booklet included.

6429389,3,B00KHA8992,We love the Toy Story shorts and Toy Story of Terror is a really cute one. But it only has a runtime of about 20 minutes and for $12.99 it's really pricey.

6429390,5,B00KHA8992,"I got this for my 4 year old nephew and he e-mailed me that he loves it. The ""terror"" isn't really that scary, he said, and the toy story characters are really funny.",1408665600,,166,4.0606060606060606
6429391,5,B00KHA8992,"Our favorite toys are back, but when the road trip they're on gets delayed at a roadside motel, they find themselves trapped in their very own scary movie.  In classic horror movie form, they disappear one by one and it's up to Jesse to overcome her fears, save the day and solve the mystery.  Toy Story of Terror uses flips the clichs from the horror, suspense and monster movie genres with nods to adults and without getting too scary for the little ones.  Pixar keeps the quality strong with top notch animation and the original voice cast returning and even adds to it.  If you didn't catch this on TV it's worth picking up.
The 22 minute short is great as is, but Disney has put together a really terrific Blu-ray release with this title.  There are the usual start-up trailers but you can go ahead and jump to a cute haunted house menu which looks to be pulled from the vampire movie the gang is watching in the trunk of the car, the feature with can be played with or without commercial breaks (more on those later,) and quite a few bonus features.  For most people the Toy Story Toons will be the main draw here, including Hawaiian Vacation, Small Fry (love the surprising appearance of Jane Lynch as Neptuna,) and Partysaurus Rex.  All three are great.  There are three deleted scenes and explanation from the editor about what they are and why they got cut.  They are rough line drawings with temp voices, but they give you a good idea about the scenes and some insight on the animation process.  There's a behind the scenes called Team of Specialists which really gets into the new characters and what it's like at Pixar. There's the trailer for the special that was shown at D23 and three vintage toy commercials.  The commercials really show how deep Pixar goes with its characters, giving us a commercial for Combat Carl (still voiced by the amazing Carl Weathers,) Old Timer, and Transitron, all done in the style that they would have been done back in the day.  If you're a child of the 80s you will appreciate these.  Additionally there are a number of audio options, including English in 7.1, 5.1, 2.0, English descriptive 2.0, French and Spanish both in 5.1.  There are also English, English for Hearing Impaired, French and Spanish Subtitles.  There are some sneak peeks tacked on including a very brief commercial for Star Wars Rebels.
Overall it's a fantastic short and a jam packed release with quite a few extras.  The digital copy is easy to add through Disney Movie Rewards and Disney Movies Anywhere and includes many of the extras above.  If you enjoyed the special when it aired of like the characters, go get this disc!  It's a wonderful companion to the films and deserves a spot on the shelf right next to them.",1408579200,12,2743,4.597535934291581
