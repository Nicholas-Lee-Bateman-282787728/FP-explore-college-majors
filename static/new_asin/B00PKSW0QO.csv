If you come into this looking for an amateurish B movie to laugh at, you're probably going to enjoy yourself. This movie has bad acting, a bizarre soundtrack, gratuitous Sister Hazel cameos, drunken skankery and immense age gap relationships. In short, it's #floridaman the movie. I highly recommend it!",1496102400,,438,4.9324324324324325
8688498,1,B00PKSW0QO,Awful display of bipolar. This makes people with bipolar look dangerous and homocidal. They aren't.,1486684800,,99,5.666666666666667
8688499,1,B00PKSW0QO,"One star because I can't give zero. Horrible, horrible, terrible acting. Dismal. The story line wasn't bad, but the acting.... If it could even be called acting... I've seen better performances in kindergarten plays, because at least they're genuine. Do not waste $2.99. Just don't do it. Just because someone taught at SCAD, DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN OR SHOULD ACT.",1448755200,4,363,4.967213114754099

  Things start out serenely enough as the personalities of and relationships between Lucas (James Bock), Oscar (Matthew Foote), Audrey (Alison Rae), and Lauren (Jenny Johnson) are established. Initially were given only a few brief glimpses that something is a bit off about Audrey, but that changes fairly quickly once things start happening which she sees as obstacles to her goal of hooking and keeping Lucas. While the movie may not intentionally feature a character who suffers from bipolar disorder, I will say as someone intimately familiar with the disorder that Alison Rae brilliantly portrays the emotional rollercoaster which is its primary hallmark. Oscar provides a nice balance of comic relief to offset the tension as the story builds to its dramatic ending, while the relationship between Audrey and Lauren provides a window into both Audreys mindset and the events which set off her downward spiral. Make no mistake, the story is fairly dark overall but is well told and entertaining.

  All in all, this is a movie well worth watching. Very few special effects are used, so there is no distraction from the story itself. While not officially rated, it would easily fall into the R category. It is definitely not for young children, and contains both strong language and adult situations.",1416614400,3,1536,5.031496062992126

Look at the article in the Gainesville Sun where the director states the movie is NOT based on a character with Bipolar disorder but  bipolar  behavior  is  representative of the mental condition of the people behind mass shootings. .Really? Do your own research as very few school shootings , etc.... we're commited by individuals with mental illness. These type of fictionalizated movies help to make individuals and their families Not obtain help. Demand they change the name of their movie!!!!!!Maybe, one of their sponsors should have been a mental health professional???I am embarrassed that a town with so many well respected medical facilities would produce/sponsor/allow location for filming of the movie that causes so much damage to so many people!!!!!!Shame on them as I first I gave them the benefit of the doubt that this was an error made by lack of knowledge but despite being informed of the damage the title of this movie is creating they have failed to respond. I quess money and possible awards at the Tampa film festival mean more?????Wish I could rate it a 0,By the way NOT a very orginal title as another movie made recently has the same title",1416355200,4,1196,4.876847290640394
