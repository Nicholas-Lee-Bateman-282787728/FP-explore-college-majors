7814163,5,6301706331,"This program of shorter pieces from various composers could hardly be better, at least for fans of Toscanini.  The playing of the NBC Symphony is very fine but the music almost takes second place behind the fascinating pictures of Toscanini conducting.  The sound, by the way, is excellent for its time. My only cavil would be that the picture could be considered quite dark (it was also in the original broadcast) but enough can be seen to appreciate the wonderful music-making.",1194566400,2,479,4.901234567901234
