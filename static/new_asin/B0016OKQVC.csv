8263708,5,B0016OKQVC,"Like all 50 minute documentary programs, this one cannot be considered a comprehensive treatment of the subject of alchemy, but it is a good basic program none-the-less.  I don't think that any of the info is off track; it's a good intro and covers the important bullet points.  I liked this DVD very much on balance, and am glad to add it to my library on occult topics.",1354838400,3,371,4.4411764705882355
