8028130,5,B0002ILTG4,"The setting is lovely - nations, more like city-states, use airships and formal rules of combat to fight battles.  The battles are overseen by the Guild.  The artwork is perfect, the characters real and the soundtrack is awesome.  The main characters are two vanship pilots who deliver letters - Claus and Lavie.

The plot becomes twisted when it seems that the Guild have their own ideas about which side should win - it seems one nation holds a girl they want.  And want bad.

The air battles are amazing, with much of the effects done by computers.  The English voices of Crispin Freeman, Tony Oliver, Steve Kramer and Lex Lang are just some of the stars you will hear.  Each disc has four episodes and some extras, but the big plus is the unfolding story.  It really hooks you and keeps you watching.  This isn't anime, this is art.",1100217600,3,836,4.550335570469799
8028131,5,B0002ILTG4,"With this purchase you get the first three dvd's of the Last Exile series.  Fans of the series might have seen this on Tech TV last winter, but you will find that the animation is much cleaner on DVD format.  The contents of the DVD extras are uninspired, but the story is the real gem here.  The approach of this title actually makes the fantasy seem plausible.  The voice work is astounding, featuring the voices of Spike from Cowboy Bebop, Vash the Stampede from Trigun, Alucard from Hellsing and many noticable others.  High quality and well worth the purchase, I know I'll be returning to this series again and again",1097539200,4,621,4.609090909090909
8028132,5,B0002ILTG4,"Last Exile has excellent art, a compelling story, interesting characters, and truly exciting sky battles.  Every episode leaves you hungry for more.  The world of futuristic airships is gritty and techy, while remaining warm and rich.

And the price is a great bargain, compared to individual-disc purchases!

The three-pack dvds come in individual, fully-labelled plastic cases, just as if they were bought seperately.  (I buy for a library, so these are important details for me.  Oh, and the labels are eye-catching foil artwork, as well! Lovely for display.)",1095897600,3,562,5.329545454545454
8028133,5,B0002ILTG4,"Last Exile is definitely worth the purchase. If you are familiar with Trigun, Hellsing or Cowboy Bebop, you may enjoy hearing a lot familiar voice actors(the voices of Vash the Stampede and Meryl Stryfe from Trigun and Alucard from Hellsing are among main characters). The world of Last Exile is that of a non-computerized future which revolves heavily upon air travel. It has a great balance of action and character development and mystery with an awesome score to accompany it. Last Exile lives up to what you would expect of a cojoint effort by Gonzo, Pioneer, and JVC.",1094428800,2,572,4.846938775510204
