186978,3,1568124945,I made a huge mistake by doing this video BEFORE I did Volume 1. I had no idea about the lack of intensity and the equipment that was needed to do this workout. It totally turned me off to The Firm for a few months!,1005782400,2,215,3.8
186979,5,1568124945,"i have been using the firm workout videos for over two years, and this is one of my favorites.  I like the fact that it works my entire body in less than an hour, and places extra emphasis on women's trouble areas- the hips, buttocks, and thighs.  I would recommend this video to anyone!!",978739200,7,288,4.314814814814815
186980,5,1568124945,"I have used this tape so much, along with some other firm tapes, that I have worn them out.  I want to be able to reorder this great tape but you are not producing it along with some of your other older tapes.  Please consider re-publishing this tape (and others) in VHS and DVD.  It is a classic.  I am a firm believer. I am in great health and shape as a result of using your tapes for years.",976924800,3,394,3.949367088607595
186981,4,1568124945,"This is a wonderful video.  Unlike some of the recently released Firm videos, this one features 1 instructor throughout.  If you need to get more weight work, just increase your weights on your barbell, or dumbbells.  This is easily adaptable for beginners.

186982,5,1568124945,"I just purchased this video and i really have to say i absolutely LOVE it!  I have been looking for a workout video like this for along time.  I have several other FIRM workout videos and this is my favorite....I really  enjoy alot of aerobics and this tape does have alot and not the old boring  same step aerobics either.  It seemed just when i thought i couldn't go any  further...that segment ended and another interesting and challenging one  began that made me keep on going .  I realized that after doing this video  a couple of times it was becoming my favorite.  I try to alternate it with  another firm video every other day ,but sometimes have trouble keeping  myself away from it.  It is a very modivating, fun, challenging, feeling  like you actually worked out video that ALWAYS leaves me dripping at the  end.... I really like the instructor...she kept me going and the music kept  my feet moving.  I would recommend this video to anyone who is looking for  any of the above.  IT IS THE BEST IN MY OPION!",964396800,5,1019,4.469945355191257
186983,5,1568124945,"I own several Firm tapes and this is my favorite. I am over fifty and it is great to see some ""older"" fittness buffs. This tape gives me a total body workout without wearing me out. I would like to see more videos  featuring the ""older exercisers"". Janie Poteet is an excellent  instructor. It would be a shame if this video remains unavailabe.",948844800,13,344,4.444444444444445
186984,4,1568124945,I have been a Firm Believer since 1990.  This workout is one of my new favorites.  It works almost all muscle groups and really concentrates on the areas that will give you the most dramatic results.  I love including  pelvic floor exercises in a workout- then I don't forget on my own!  This  workout can grow with your fitness level- just increase weights as your  fitness level grows! Simple cues and not too perky encouragement plus the  inspirational music makes this a wonderful workout!,948758400,6,493,4.785714285714286

186986,5,1568124945,"I absolutely love this cardio workout! It is fun and motivating. Carissa Foster is a great instuctor, The music is very motivating the participants look like they are having fun. This is a good intermediate/ advance workout. My advice to you is try it!! The instructor makes you feel like you can get through this workout from beginning to end!! Even though it is challenging you are a little disappointed when the workout end, but know that you can't do it over again. So that said get it, do it !!!!",1166659200,,501,4.516483516483516
186987,5,1568124945,"PROs

- This is one of my favorite Firm videos. It's not so easy that you'd get bored or feel under-challenged, not so hard that you'd give up. When you get stronger, just add poundage.

- There's a sufficient variety of exercises and good sequencing to keep you from getting bored and/or too exhausted.

- Step-ups with barbells interspersed with calf pumps are my favorite part, and if your heart wasn't pumping before this segment, it will be soon enough.

- The squats are excellent--you really feel your thighs and legs getting exercised.

- Jayne Poteet is a good instructor, w/ great cueing, counting down the number of reps at every 4 reps (16, 12, 8, 4). This works really well for me because I know I'm getting closer to the end of the set.

- I like the stretch before and after the workout.

CONs

- Not too much of a ""con"" but I think a longer stretch routine (for all the Firm videos I've tried, actually) would be healthier and more effective.",1141689600,4,958,4.4655172413793105
186988,5,1568124945,"This is volume 6

An outstanding workout when you want something a little lighter;but you can add intensity by using a higher step up box.  Remember the Firm is into shocking your body so there are moves in this work out that are different -- moves shouldn't be done the same all the time anyway.

Since The Firm dosen't sale these older volumes anymore and this was one of the last true ""volumes"" it has become a collectors item for those of us that truly know the Firm.  Enjoy!",1127088000,3,479,4.348314606741573
186989,5,1568124945,"I recently found myself a used copy of this video.  So glad I did, it is too bad it is out of print, it's a great video.  The workout is led by Carissa Foster.  It runs about 45 minutes, the majority of it is cardio, with the last 15 minutes being toning with weights.  There is a lot of cardio variety here, you will see low impact, high impact, step aerobics, 4 limb aerobics some of it on the step.  There is also an aerobics section which uses a small ball, a soccer ball or small pillow would be a good substitute if you do not have a small ball.  You could even skip the ball if you wanted.  The toning section is short but thorough, you will see lunges and dips, pushups, upright rows, bent over rows, bicep curls and tricep dips all in just 15 minutes.  Most of the toning work is done with a barbell, but dumbells can be easily used in place if you do not have a barbell.  A short box is used for aerobics, plus the lunges and dips, and a tall box is used for a set of tall box climbs.  A step and stool would also work here.

If you can find a copy of this video get it, it is loads of fun and the music is great too, some of the best music I have heard in a Firm video.  Highly recommended.",1110067200,7,1201,3.9173553719008263
186990,5,1568124945,i love the ab routine. this workout is the core of my collection.,1085961600,,65,4.076923076923077
186991,5,1568124945,"This is my favorite weight training workout for when I have more time.  The routines are simple, so I can learn them quickly, and the workout is VERY intense and rewarding.  You'll feel like a work-horse when you're done.  Just doing this once or twice a week will make you ALOT stronger and will improve your posture.  It's the only weight training video that has kept my interest and I've been doing it for YEARS.  Make sure you get steppers that are the appropriate height for your height.  The FIRM folks will tell you which ones to get.  You can't beat it; it's one of my top 3 overall.  Good luck!

186992,5,1568124945,"This is a great, basic workout that combines strength training and aerobics.  The instructor is easy to follow and her instructions are concise and to the point.  Perfect for those who shy away from ""dancy"" aerobic routines.  As a personal trainer and fitness instructor, I highly recommend this video.",1041638400,7,302,5.122448979591836
186993,4,1568124945,"If you can get past the cheesy flash dance type moves (it is an older tape), it's not a bad tape.  It is a great tape for beginners, or intermediates on the beginner side.  I either didn't read the previous reviews or the tape description closely enough, and was disappointed with the cardio/aerobic aspect of the tape.  It is very slow cardio, which is great for those with joint problems, or bodies that can't move as fast. I will use this tape on my 'off' days, and another aerobic/weight tape when I want a heavier workout.  In comparison to the 'new' Firm tapes (those on Infomercial now), this tape seems very slow and out of date, but again, still a good tape to use for a  not so intense feeling workout.",1029974400,,712,4.404580152671755
186994,5,1568124945,"I love this workout.  Some of the other reviewers have mentioned that this is a little less intense than some of the other firms.  That is precisely the reason I love it so much.  It is very effective with less stress on your joints.  Originally it was intended as a workout for the ""baby boomers"" approaching middle age, but really it is adaptable to all.  The lower body segment is killer if done with weights appropriate to your strength level, but the aerobic segment is less intense than some.  I am 48 but still run and workout to the other firms as well as Gilad, so I am in fairly decent shape, but I can still feel the hover squats in this video!  The firm and Gilad in my opinion have the best workout videos bar none.  They are not dancy or cutesy; just good solid effective workouts with real results.  And isn't real results the reason we all do this in the first place?  BTW I was just lucky enough to obtain another copy of this out of print video on e-bay.",1029542400,5,972,4.262295081967213

7796858,5,1568124945,"I pretty much have all the FIRM videos, but what I love about this one is the focus on the legs & butt (a lot of squats & step box work), however, still an all around great strength training routine!  I love it.",1374019200,,211,3.9069767441860463
7796859,5,1568124945,"Out of ALL of every FIRM workout out there..this one is one of my TOP FAVORITES!!! For some reason this one to me has the best music and FUN easy moves! I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this workout! It NEVER gets boring to me!!! I feel you get a good toning workout (light weights), but the moves and segments just flow easily!!!!!!

Oh, and they do have it on DVD now :) you can search for it. and When I found out about this being (FINALLLLLLY) out on DVD, I bought one ASAP and has been doing it at least 1-2 times a week. I just LOVE this one!!

If you have done the firm ""cardios"" before, out of the three (super cardio, Cardio Burn), this one falls into the one that is the most ""moderate"" and easier, yet still a great workout! Cardio Burn is a bit more higher impact, and Super Cardio (aka Calorie Killer 2), is a bit lower, this one is right in between!! Oh and they also now have Cardio burn on DVD!!!!!!!!! Now I have ALL THREE on DVD....a perfect heaven!!!!!!!!!!

Seriously though, if you love cardio with light 4 limb and more better music, then this one is your #1 :)",1347148800,,1072,4.219512195121951

7796861,5,1568124945,"Love this one! All these years I didn't realize that Maximum Cardio, Cardio Burn and Power Cardio were the workouts that Core Cardio I, Core Cardio II and Bust and Butt were taken from because The Firm was sneaky and issued the later three first. They were really just Parts tapes! And funny enough, I liked Carissa's parts the best and considered just fast  forwarding to her parts on the tapes when I found out about Maximum Cardio.

This workout consists of some great, original routines that are really fun to do. You just can't get bored and the workout goes by fast. When I previewed it it seemed like it was on super high-speed but it didn't feel that way when I was doing it, though it does move fast. It's not as high-impact as Cardio Burn and is a great mix of hi-lo, step and four-limbed cardio sometimes including light weights. Some jumps are sneaked in as well. After the cardio there's some great weight work, but this workout's focus is cardio. I really like Carissa Foster as an instructor as well.",1217462400,2,1015,4.510869565217392

7796863,5,1568124945,"I've owned and used this video for nearly 10 years. I'm a Jazzercise junkie and use videos when for whatever reason I don't go to Jazzercise.  After trying many videos and CDs, The Firm and Gilead, in my opinion, consistently give the best, and safest, workouts. I often turn to this video for a good, all-over workout that isn't too vigorously jumping or dancing.  The cuing is excellent and you can ramp up or tone down the weight levels depending on how you feel.  I've never used this video with a barbell but use free weights instead, and they work just fine. After all these years I still find this video challenging and don't get tired of it.",1202947200,,649,4.483050847457627
7796864,5,1568124945,I have been doing the Firm for years and this is still one of my favorites. I saw another reviewer commenting she previewed the tape and thought the instructors were too into themselves. She obviously never has done any Firms. They are as tough as you want them to be by adding poundage. I love this video because it's low impact but you can still make it difficult by adding heavier weights. The hover squats with the dumbell always makes my butt feel worked. I like the newer Firms but the old ones make me sweat the most. Jayne Poteet is a great instructor.,1186531200,2,560,4.394230769230769
