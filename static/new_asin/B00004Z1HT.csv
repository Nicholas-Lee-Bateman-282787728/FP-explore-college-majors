Every since he was an infant I would show him flash cards, read him books and have him watch educational videos. I think that's why he finds learning fun and anything that teaches him something new entertaining to watch. Teaching your children now instead of waiting for a teacher to teach them is key. that's the secret to making learning fun and not a struggle.",1293148800,2,483,4.627906976744186
1379861,3,B00004Z1HT,i thought this was going to be more fun mentally than addition flying across the screen. The box was also crushed and banged up. will not purchase again from buyer.,1292025600,2,164,4.5
1379862,1,B00004Z1HT,"I liked the Rock-N-Learn Telling Time video and the Rock-N-Learn Money and Counting Change  dvd. My 6yo learned to tell time in one afternoon after watching that video. The Money video was clear and well presented - even if the music in both was dated and somewhat annoying even downright corny, overall I felt as though the materal was, again, clearly presented in a logical, well-thought out presentation. And, my child learned the principles as they were set forth on the video.

Having had a positive experience with the first two, I went ahead and ordered Rock-N-Learn Addition and Subtraction Rock without previewing it. School was due to open soon and I wanted my 6yo going into 1st grade to have a supplement that reinforced basic math principles. Wrong! The Addition and Subtraction Rock dvd has nothing - nothing! - but a sing-songy voice burbling out addition and subtraction equations over and over and over again. No explanation of math principles or how to read an equation or even how to prove your work by working backwards in an equation, such as: 1 + 3 = 4, thus 4 - 3 = 1. It is very frustrating to sit through the entire length of the dvd listening to nothing but a voice singing repetitive equations the entire time. Silly idea and nonsensical presentation of the material. This is simply awful and not worth the money. After 10 minutes both of my children were pleading: ""turn it off, it's driving me crazy!""

I wish I was exaggerating, but really, the entire dvd consists of people singing: ""four minus three is...one!"" ""Five plus six is...eleven!"" Between the wacky music and the kooky mathematical mantra, it is a very curious addition to the otherwise solidly good Rock-N-Learn series.",1251504000,10,1711,4.793220338983051
1379863,3,B00004Z1HT,"This product is good, but the songs and info goes by to quickly. Needs to slow the pace of the spelling of the words a little bit more.",1244764800,3,135,3.857142857142857
1379864,3,B00004Z1HT,"This product covers the material in great depth and gives the child a chance to answer the question before giving the answer. It starts off simply with visual presentations of each numeral, then the addition or subtraction, and a visual of the final answer, then progresses to higher skill levels, all the way to addition fact memorization. The choice of presentation style is a little slow. I found ""Math Circus"" by Leap Frog to have a much more engaging presentation but Leap Frog doesn't have anything which covers the material as thoroughly. We watch this Rock'n Learn video while eating lunch or supper where it isn't as engaging and is more repetitive in nature.",1239494400,11,668,4.868421052631579
1379865,5,B00004Z1HT,I work in an elementary school and my students LOVE this video! The music gets their attention and they love trying to shout out the answers before the video! It's so rare you see many students excited about math.,1235520000,,213,4.487179487179487
1379866,1,B00004Z1HT,"Having had a very good experience with the Rock and Learn Phonics, I bought this to teach my daughter addition. This DVD does not help teach anything. It just says adding 1 to a number makes the next number and adding 0 keeps the same number. That is where the teaching ends. After that hours of adding some random numbers without any introduction whatsoever. Don't bother buying.",1167004800,28,380,4.686567164179104
1379867,5,B00004Z1HT,"Great Phonics Vidoe. A must Have for every household. I have a 3 and 2 year old that love it and my 3yr. is already sounding out words.

7927971,1,B00004Z1HT,"Boring.  I've bought other Rock 'n Learn videos in the past and been happy with them, but this video is awful.  It sounds static-y and the music in the same tune over and over and over and over again.  I asked my 7yo daughter how she liked it and she said it was boring.  I was hoping for something fun that would help her learn her math facts during our daily commute, but I don't plan on using this again.",1446595200,,407,4.05
7927972,3,B00004Z1HT,It's basically just flashcards on TV. In between flashcards there is someone playing a guitar or drums. The songs are boring and I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of it. My 5 year old felt the same way. The flashcard drill will be helpful in short segments for rote memorization of addition problems. The first half of the video did show pictures of objects that they added together and that was helpful for younger kids.,1424217600,,425,4.605263157894737
7927973,1,B00004Z1HT,"Am so dissapointed with that video, no help what so ever, i order other dvd from ROCK N LEARN and was very please, but this one is no help. wish they would help break down the concept to the kids, instead of just singing like that can help, they don't even allow the child to think befor they give the answers, very disappointed, AM GOING TO RETURN FOR SURE.",1422576000,,358,4.202898550724638
7927974,5,B00004Z1HT,Our Autistic son loves these. He gonna destroy the DVD soon enough. He runs the DVD constantly and all day.,1419465600,,107,4.4
7927975,1,B00004Z1HT,"Horrible save your money, problems were not consequential in format and hard to learn.basically watched a fool sing to numbers. My children even thought it was horrible and confusing and they watch some pretty boring stuff and enjoy it. Again save your money bought from a teacher recommendation never again",1379462400,,307,5.16
7927976,3,B00004Z1HT,I was expecting a CD and so when a DVD arrived I was disappointed.  I thought that we would listen to it on the way to school in the mornings.  We did watch the DVD and it did not impress me.  My son lost interest after the 2nd time.,1370995200,,233,3.7142857142857144
7927977,5,B00004Z1HT,"The Rock 'N Learn Videos have worked great with helping my son learn, since he is a very visual child.  I am so happy with how they are presented to him and he loves the music they play along with the learning material.  It is allot of fun for him.  I would highly recommend any of their products (we have several).",1366156800,,315,4.131147540983607
7927978,4,B00004Z1HT,This DVD makes learning fun and puts it to a catchy song so that they are excited about learning more.  I would definitely recommend this for a challenge to K/1st Graders.,1353974400,,171,4.516129032258065
7927979,1,B00004Z1HT,"The Phonics DVD in this brand was excellent.  This, however was not educational.  The DVD is very fast.  No methodology for teaching basic concepts.  Random additions and subtractions. Could make the process of learning these math problems more difficult.  I also bought Telling time and Earth Science and they are also too fast.  No pause to ensure concepts are understood and reiterated, just a continuous noisy rap or chatter.",1330905600,,429,5.144927536231884
