8493176,5,B00652U6KG,This purchase was well worth it.  The energy and strength put into this work is worth seeing It over and over again.  Angelique has inspiring guest and the music is so uplifting.  The DVD has excellent quality and I would purchase another piece that is produced by her and this group.,1369699200,,284,4.529411764705882

8493178,5,B00652U6KG,"I really like this DVD. My only complaint is that it's way too short (an hour maybe?). It's like you get revved up & then it's quickly over. Outstanding performances - by Ms. Kidjo herself of course, Branford Marsalis, Dianne Reeves & Josh Groban. The Fela dancers added a nice touch as did the band (Christian McBride on bass).",1336348800,2,328,4.576271186440678
