8284145,5,B001BP14Q2,"This is the best Serge Gainsbourg film ever, and perhaps the only good one.

The late 1960's are screamed out in the decor and in the storyline.
Every Serge Gainsbourg fan would love this film, it is far better than the silly ""Heroic Life"" biographic film made about him.

Even people sho don't like Serge Gainsbourg but like quirky French films from the era would enjoy this. The plot looks overly simple - older man falls for younger woman, but starts to have problems getting a divorce from his wife. I don't want to spoil the ending.
Under the surface the film makes a point about advertising unrealistic dreams, fakery and infidelity.",1393804800,,639,4.696428571428571

The world-famous affair that would begin with this movie that would create two legends in their own lifetime; those of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin,  would still prove popular more than forty years on!  This is a two disc set which includes bonus material - all done with English subtitles (including the movie itself) which is a great pity, since I would have expected such a great and iconic movie to have been `dubbed' for English audiences by now - perhaps for those excepting who may think it would spoil the authenticity perhaps, but it would have certainly helped to reach a much wider audience.

I do not normally take to movies with subtitles, they can be so distracting - especially when there is a lot of dialogue.  As it is, this is just fine!  Accompanied throughout by Serge's beautiful title theme song that haunts the viewer long after the movie has ended!  There are some beautiful scenes too in this picture - beautifully shot - my favourite being the one as they're travelling in the car to the great theme song. The story is quite strong, but I'm afraid the poor David and Dado characters do not stand a chance against the charms of the handsome, charismatic and sexy Serge here;  they're simply too young, inexperienced and rather boyish for a young woman so in love with a much older man...

Whenever I think of Jane Birkin, I see her with that iconic wicker basket she carries in this movie. She and Serge were more than the legendary song `Je T'aime'; sung by a couple who would be forever attached by wires it would seem for the rest of their lives - and this film is where it all started!

A great and iconic movie from the decade where everything was at its peak!

NOTE:  For fans of Jane; she can be seen interviewed in English (though she now speaks with a French accent!) on YouTube - she comes across as a really LOVELY person;  modest and hasn't a derogatory word to say bout anybody...",1377043200,,2032,4.489130434782608

8284149,4,B001BP14Q2,"""Slogan"" is that type of film that French cinema seems to do better than anyone else, A mix-and-match of almost unlikeable characters who are redeemed by their love for each other.  It is the type of love that is unfathomable and sometimes cruel, but made romantic by the artistry of the director's camera and the illogical logic of a screenplay (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Betty-Blue/dp/B0002TSZH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Betty Blue</a>, anyone?)

In this case, the two misfits are Serge Faberge (Serge Gainsbourg, a popular French musician  and actor who also wrote the score) and Evelyne (Jane Birkin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blow-Up/dp/B0000WN0ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blow Up</a>).  Serge is a forty year old advertisement director with a pregnant wife named Francoise (Andrea Parisy) and a bad case of ennui.  His life is satisfyingly dull, with his skills as a director much in demand and his commercials constantly winning awards.  At one such awards festival, in Venice, Serge meets the eighteen year old Evelyne, and in a case of lust at first sight the two are soon engaged in a torrid affair.  You can probably figure out the rest of the story.

The back-story of ""Slogan"" gives it as much of its status as the film itself.  A scandal erupted when the real-life Serge and Jane (the woman for whom designer Hermes' created the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birkin-Bag/dp/0061473340/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birkin Bag</a>&nbsp;for) started an off-screen romance that lasted for an eleven-year marriage and saw the release of the duet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Je-T-Aime-Moi-Non-Plus/dp/B000006YW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Je T'Aime Moi Non Plus</a>&nbsp;(""""I love you... me neither"") which was a Number One hit even though it was banned for Birkin's simulating an orgasm as part of the song.  Disco queen Donna Summers later covered the song and also imitated it for her own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-to-Love-You-Baby/dp/B000001F9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love to Love You Baby</a>.

As a movie, ""Slogan"" is a pleasant piece of nostalgia.  It embodies that ""Swinging 60s"" -style later mocked by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers/dp/B00006WUWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers</a>&nbsp;films. Serge is the embodiment of Gallic charm and indifference, with heavy-lidded eyes and an ever-present cigarette always dangling from his lips.  He casually discusses with Evelyne's step-father the best way to beat her in order to keep the girl in line, and is as quick to answer Evelyne's demands with a smack in the mouth as with a kiss.  Evelyne, on the other hand, is a child in mind as well as body, unsophisticated and willing to let Serge take control, with a child's need for affection and devotion.  She has none of Serge's cynicism.

Her first starring role in a film (she had previously been eye candy in other Swinging 60s films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Knack-and-How-to-Get-It/dp/B000069HZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Knack... and How to Get It</a>), Jane Birkin is not the most talented actress, but looks devastating in the small dresses and 60s fashion that she constantly bounces around in.  She would later earn the OBE in 2001, for her long music and film career as well as her humanitarian causes, but in ""Slogan"" she is still a novice.

Probably my favorite bits of ""Slogan"" were Serge's commercials, which are over-the-top stabs at the consumerist culture that ruled at the time.  There are some real gems here, like an adventurer doing battle with knife-wielding natives and comparing their knife cuts to the smoothness of his shaving cream, or a naked women getting whipped by kilt-wearing Scotsman and asking if your complexion ever needs to get ""whipped into shape.

Cult Epics release of ""Slogan"" is a nice presentation, especially in this two-disk special edition.  The print is not the most pristine, and Cult Epics is not known for their restoration, but it is nice to have this rare film available in any condition.  The first disk has only the main feature, and the second disk being loaded with extra features including interviews with Birkin and Gainsbourg being very much in love, as well as behind-the-scenes glimpses at the advertising world so effectively spoofed by ""Slogan.""",1266537600,9,4602,6.135514018691588
