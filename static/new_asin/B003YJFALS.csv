4229819,3,B003YJFALS,"I have been a science fiction fan all of my life...I'm 59. Somehow I missed this series, so I bought it here for a good price. I think that for it's day (early 80's...soldiers are still wearing old pisspot helmets), it was probably cutting edge. Quite frankly, I'm having trouble getting through it. It's not the concept, which I find is grear. It's the writing, which is full of cliches, the acting, which is wooden with no chemistry between the characters, which of course goes back to the writing again and the directing. It's outdated and owes a lot of it's style and form to Quinn Martin shows, like the Invaders, except they existed 15 years earlier. I think my biggest beefs are that the aliens say the same things in each episode...""we must raise our bretheren, these humans are stronger than we anticipated, we must accomplish this brothers or all is lost."" The humans do the same thing and they are wooden enough to make Keanu Reeves look animated.

I do like the way they transition from the 1953 film with Gene Barry to now. To throw in some references to HG Wells would have been nice and thus far I've discovered no real purpose for the invasion, although I might have missed it. With the kind of military power the aliens have, this should be no contest.

I'm keeping the set so I can watch it again, but so far I'm underwhelmed.",1375401600,20,1344,4.504098360655738
4229820,4,B003YJFALS,"This set is TV's sequel to the original story. If you're a sci-fi fan, you will still enjoy this series.",1367539200,3,104,4.25
4229821,4,B003YJFALS,"I enjoyed this series when it first aired on TV. That's why I wanted it in my collection. I think the first year was the best. So, if you don't want to go for the whole thing, get the first year.",1348963200,4,195,3.7804878048780486
4229822,5,B003YJFALS,"Very good, enjoyed it when it was on tv, even better on DVD.
it's like it was continued from the original movie.",1346544000,6,112,4.136363636363637
4229823,2,B003YJFALS,"Great set, except... I thought this was gonna be a nice complete edition boxed set, or something similar. Instead it is just season one (nicely slipcased) and season two (plain dvd case) bound together with plastic wrap. Not so cool in my opinion. They should have made the extra effort to make a nice (fold out?)box. This way it only looks cheap. But for the contents, great to be able to watch the entire series.",1336435200,,414,4.533333333333333
4229824,1,B003YJFALS,"how the hell it is possible that this great show does not have a choice of subtitles or languages? Paramount is the only study that does not add to their shows these options, I remind you gentlemen, that in the United States, the second most spoken language is Spanish, followed by French, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and so on. So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Paramount shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing. I love this show, and I speak and understand English, yet do not buy it, and I recommend anyone who does not have English as their mother tongue do not buy it. Enough to discrimination against non-English speakers.",1311984000,4,671,4.894736842105263
4229825,1,B003YJFALS,"I recently ordered the War of The World Complete Series and found Disc 3 on ""The Final Season"" does not work. I returned the set and requested a replacement. The second set has the identical problem on the same disc. I gave up, returned it again and asked for a refund. Watch out there might be a batch problem with these DVDs.",1291334400,10,327,4.290322580645161
4229826,1,B003YJFALS,"There is nothing redeeming about this show, everything about it is terrible. The writing would insult the intelligence of a stupid person. The acting is wooden. There is absolutely no character development or chemistry between the actors, the sets are cheap and I would not be surprised if this was produced a bunch 3rd graders and financed with bake sales. This is the worst sci-fi series I ever watched. My dvd player died after playing four episodes (honest) I think it committed  suicide rather play one more minute of this c**p",1465344000,2,532,4.846153846153846
4229827,5,B003YJFALS,Good Sci-Fi For The Time. Great Price For The Whole Series! Watched This When It Came Out On Regular TV. Looks Better Now On Blu-Ray Player And 4K-TV.,1464134400,,150,4.392857142857143
4229828,4,B003YJFALS,it was good the main problem with this series is the gap that was left between season 1 and 2,1457654400,,93,3.7

4229830,4,B003YJFALS,"For me season one was way better, but if your a hardcore fan and still want the final episodes, including the iconic action-packed season premiere (in which Drake is killed by the aliens and Ironhorse sacrifices himself to save his teammates) and the series' finale (which didn't make any sense and was really boring, but nevertheless it did have a conclusion to the show, showing us the end of the war between the humans and the alien invaders), then this complete series packet is a great buy.",1445472000,2,495,4.7011494252873565
4229831,4,B003YJFALS,"This two season series is like two different series. Season One takes place in present day America (circa 1990 when cell phones were the size of bricks and almost as heavy) and has us fighting the Martians from the 1953 movie ""War of the Worlds."" Season Two takes place in ""Almost Tomorrow"" when we find out the Martians are really from Mothra. The first season has the resurection of the aliens who then learn to take on human form but the radiation needed to maintain that form causes them to decay. A task force, the Blackwood Project, is set up to battle the aliens. In the second season some time has past and the introduction to the shows infers that war has led to the collapse of society and the segmentation of government. A post apocalyptic society more like the first Mad Max movie than the second. Two of the main characters from Season One are killed off and Adrian Paul of ""The Highlander"" TV series is introduced as John Kincaid. The special effects, sets and props are up to par with for TV in the late 80's early 90's, not to bad but dated. I give this series a four star rating instead of a three because of the second season. It's dark and gritty and Paul makes you believe in the cause of the Blackwood Project.",1439424000,12,1231,4.4035087719298245
4229832,5,B003YJFALS,"I miss these episodes dearly, I'm glad to purchase this dvd from Amazon.",1424908800,,72,4.615384615384615
4229833,4,B003YJFALS,"I love this series when it first came out I was sad to see that it folded. It is cheesy sci-fi at its best. I used to watch it when it first came on TV. If I'm correct it was one of the many TV series that came out of Canada. They had a certain type of film look to them and a feel that you got from them and the unknown actors who are usually Canadians. Of course my favorite character was the special forces officer.

Overall it was just a fun series to watch. In my area it showed on Saturday right after the monster movie. It was just good fun to watch. You also wanted to to in the week following just to see what was going on. They had explosions, Uzis, and Aliens! What more could you want! It also had cut scenes from the original movie.
All in all just good clean cheesy alien fun!",1424649600,6,790,3.9375
4229834,3,B003YJFALS,"It is a good series but, I thought there were more of them.",1422748800,,59,3.6153846153846154

4229843,5,B003YJFALS,"I gave it 5 starts because only in the Sci-Fi genre can a show be so bad that it's good and in this case great!  Look at the characters in the first season.  You've got the tree hugging nutty professor, the American Indian warrior military guy, the level headed divorcee scientist, and of course our handicapped Jamaican computer wiz in a voice activated wheel chair who can hack through ANY US govt. computer in record time with his state of the art, Honeywell Bull PC.  It's a scream!  Toss in some good old fashioned Gothic horror from the aliens and voila!! We have a low budget Sci-Fi show that borders on camp.  Man, I love this show.  For those of you who trashed it, you've got to take it for what it is.",1402272000,20,712,4.315789473684211
4229844,5,B003YJFALS,I enjoyed both the first part and the second though they were decidedly different in many ways. I personally like most sci-fi movies.,1398211200,2,133,4.826086956521739

8409477,5,B003YJFALS,"Dark, weird spin off from the classic movie. The cast is adequate but the scripts are not Shakespeare. This is fun and call it camp. There are not a lot of sci fi horror series to chose from. You could do a lot worse. This is the complete First Season, but not the whole thing. You have the Final season to go yet. Dark weird fun.",1497484800,,330,4.015151515151516
8409478,5,B003YJFALS,"This series is so full of corn. I happen to like B type material . its ok for a sunday afternoon . If your not in the mood ,you will want to sling the disc across the room!! other than that, its ok . The transfer from video tape is not so great, a lot of slop in the picture. Many S F fans will note that Jared Martin also had a small part in the movie ""West World"" as a technician in the control room ,who died of lack of air when technology failed.",1487808000,,450,3.7473684210526317

I am having a hard time watching it,i am on the second eps and I am seriously thinking of just watching something else. Maybe V the series it is as cheesy but it was much more fun",1468022400,,329,3.7142857142857144
