3078379,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout DVD.  It's very intense and non-stop for twenty minutes.  By the end you'll definitely think that twenty minutes is a long enough workout.  I would start at level one even if you are intermediate or advanced.  Level two kicked my butt and I work out every day.  Each work out is three circuits of 3 minutes strength, two minutes cardio, and one minute abs.  You move up to the next level at your own pace.  There is no time limit for being at any of the levels.  Highly recommend this DVD.",1206489600,16,513,4.270833333333333
3078380,5,B00127RAJY,"I have recently decided that home workouts are the only way I am going to ensure I get a workout in every day, with a toddler and a full time job. Thus, I did a lot of research on good DVDs and some essential ""props"" and over the past few months have purchased about 12 DVDs from TaeBo to PIlates to the Biggest Loser series, and then I saw this new one from Jillian, and it surpassed everything else I own by far. I have been working out pretty regularly for over 10 years, I've done triathlon's and everything from spinning to running to kickboxing, so I figured I could start at Level 3. After 3 minutes I went down to Level 2, and then another five minutes to Level 1!!! I have been doing Level 1 for a week and think I will be able to progress a level each week, but it is truly a challenging and rewarding workout, and I highly recommend it for people who enjoy maximum results in minimal time (and don't mind sweating and feel like they might have a heart attack!)",1206489600,139,971,4.170212765957447
3078381,5,B00127RAJY,"This is hands down the best workout DVD I have ever done, and I own several.  I have only done this workout a few times but already I feel the difference.  The workouts are only 20 minutes each so although they are super tough you know that you are almost done so you can push through it!  It consists of a lot of jumping, so prepare for sore calves!  Jillian in incredibly motivating.  Also, I am not a super fit person.  I only started working out a few months ago and I can just barely do level 1 so it is definitely beginner-friendly.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!",1206403200,36,581,4.18018018018018
3078382,5,B00127RAJY,"This workout is great!! I highly recommend it! If you are serious about knocking off the extra pounds then you must buy this workout, it is very hard but Jillian motivates you the whole way through. If you don't do it you are only cheating yourself out of the potential weight loss. I have a big event coming up so I'm going to do it everyday!!! I highly recommend the 30 day shred!!!",1206403200,15,384,4.273972602739726

3078384,5,B00127RAJY,Awesome workouts and takes only 30 minutes total! I agree with everything Little Ms. Cutey (cutie?) said!,1205452800,22,105,5.235294117647059
3078385,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a really good workout.  It's geared a little more to advanced exercisers, but the choreography is fairly basic and you will definately feel this the next day.
There are three workouts that combine toning and aerobics together which are about a half an hour each.  This way, you're burning fat and toning muscles at the same time.  It's a little challenging, but fun and effective.  The first workout is the easiest of the three and from there it gets more challenging.  The most challenging workout is tough like she shows on The Biggest Loser (ie travelling pushups and tough jumps etc).  It's a good idea if you're intermediate to begin either at the start or middle and stick to that for a while and then move on.  Each workout uses toning, kickboxing and ab work.
I found this really good to do.  It's absolutely a good idea to not go too quickly with it and begin at the lower of the three levels even if you do it only a couple of times - you can always advance as soon as you're ready for your next workout.  She may not be the best cuer, but she is certainly encouraging and motivating.  This is fun and I highly recommend it.  I've only done it twice so far since it's so new, but I can still feel my muscles thanking me.  This is great.",1205366400,475,1254,4.311965811965812

3078448,5,B00127RAJY,I did this program for the 30 days and lost 8 lbs and 2 dress sizes. Its hard work but this is the best shape Ive ever been in. Started at level 1 and moved up every 10 days. I have visibly defined abs! I will keep doing this to stay at this level. Thanks Jillian!,1523318400,,264,3.732142857142857
3078449,1,B00127RAJY,"I know the video is superb and would like to give it a five star rating, but I live in Norway, and the disc is locked for the US - hence the 1 star for the ""wrong"" disc. Kinda big problem really. Would wish for a refund, or perhaps (and even better), a disc that is set for Europe. But I know I am way too late for this. I torn my ACL the day before I recieved the disc and therefor didn't open it until today. Sadly. What a dissapointment.",1522800000,,440,3.8461538461538463
3078450,5,B00127RAJY,"Years ago, I enjoyed working out to Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos but my main form of exercise was going for brisk walks. I live in Wisconsin where at least four months out of the year, we are pretty much quarantined inside because of the cold so going for walks doesn't work out most of the time. I really had gotten out of shape and needed to lose weight when a friend of mine said she uses Jillian Michaels' DVDs to workout. I had never used one of hers before but figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. I searched quite a bit and decided to try the 30-Day Shred since it seemed like a popular choice.

Jillian Michaels is a fitness trainer and people may recognize her from her coaching on the show, The Biggest Loser. The 30-Day Shred consists of three different workouts which increase in intensity and use her 3-2-1 Interval System. Each workout is 20 minutes long with a two-minute warm-up before the workout and a two-minute cool down after the workout. There is a tiny break between each exercise so you can get in position and so Jillian can explain the exercise so the entire workout will take about 27 minutes total with the warm-up and cool down.

Each 20-minute workout consists of three of the 3-2-1 circuits (all exercises are different so you won't get bored). For anyone who doesn't know this system (since I didn't before I got this DVD), there are three minutes of strength exercises followed by two minutes of cardio exercises followed by one minute of abs exercises. Once you complete the first circuit, you will start with the second circuit. The exercises get a bit harder as you progress in the workout but you get warmed up and used to them.

There are three levels of workouts: levels one, two and three. Level one is the easiest but isn't considered ""easy"" by any means. I've been using this DVD for at least a few days every week and I'm on level two, which is still difficult but I'm getting better at it.

To get the most benefit from the workout, you will want to purchase some hand weights. I am using three-pound weights which is what I started with and it's tough! If you are new to working out, I would start with a lower weight. If you are working out on a hard surface, you will also want to buy a yoga/exercise mat.

Let me tell you, this DVD has been AMAZING so far! The first time I did it just under three months ago, I looked at the TV and thought ""Are you kidding me????"" because it was tough. I won't lie about that. A week later, I decided to try it again and it was a bit easier since I was somewhat familiar with the exercises. I discovered how much I enjoy the exercises and the feeling I get after an intense workout! There is such a variety of exercises that you won't likely get bored unless you feel it's time to move up to the next level, which is how I knew I was ready to try level two. I even get excited when I know I'm going to use this DVD!

Jillian is very motivating and she will push you, which is a good thing. She jokes around with the girls who workout behind her. One girl will do the modified versions for beginners and one will do the advanced versions. Jillian does a great job pointing out the differences and explaining how to do the exercises so you are doing them correctly and getting the most out of the workout.

I bought this DVD about two-and-a-half months ago and I've already lost 21 pounds! I use this DVD typically three or four times a week, along with eating healthy, and even walking outside when it's nice out. I'm very proud of what I've accomplished and I have Jillian Michaels to thank for designing an awesome workout system! I've told many of my friends that I use these DVDs and some of them have purchased them as well. Whether you are a beginner or experienced, I think you will enjoy this DVD and I highly recommend it!",1522713600,8,3818,4.3314685314685315

3078452,2,B00127RAJY,"I don't mean to give the product such low stars. The workout probably works wonders if used right. 17 months post partum with a baby and trying to loose 20 lbs without leaving the house was what got me looking for something like this. I bought the weights and set my mind to it. But I couldn't keep up past 15 days or so. I just let go again. Was not enough for me to keep going. Depends on how you like to work out. I ended up joining kickboxing and that is what is working for me. The dvd workout itself is good. Has 3 stages that you work your way up to. I do not like that I cant just put on and start the workout but instead have to go through an introduction every time. Waste of time. Jillian Michaels is awesome though and her techniques definitely will give you a burn. Repetitive moves ina. Dvd bores me, Ive discovered.",1522195200,,830,4.098159509202454

I don't follow this religiously- just throw it in a few times a week, but it does help with muscle tone!",1521849600,,401,4.742857142857143

I worried about the high impact jumping and my knees so I do those and the jump roping on my small trampoline.  This works out great for me!  I'm 47 and want to take it easy on my joints.  Ill weigh myself in a few days and hopefully i ve lost a couple of pounds.  I definitely feel stronger and more toned.  I'm using 5 lb weights and keep up ok.

3078495,5,B00127RAJY,"BUCKLE UP FOR A DETAILED REVIEW: Im a 27 female. My starting weight was at 213 and I was doing absolutely no physical activity before I started this tape. I was fit during college (age 18-22) but I gained a lot of weight since then due to working a desk job and being lazy.

On 1/1/2018, I started eating healthier breakfasts and lunches. I had a yogurt for breakfast and low-carb lunch (sweet potatoes, lentils, veggies, apple/almond butter, half of a whole grain chicken sandwich type of things). For dinner, I mostly ate healthy and if we went out I would just pick the lowest calorie salad on the menu.

I went to the doctor and they weighed me at 213. Then, I started the 30 Day Shred. Im almost at the end of the 30 Days and I weigh 186 according to my home scale which we just bought and is accurate (also verified by my husband). I did not change my eating habits, I just tried to eat healthier.

I did Level 1 for 10 days and then went straight to Level 3. I only did Level 2 for 1 day as it started off with way too much jumping for me (I hate jumping up and down). When I started Level 1, it was HARD. By the end of the 10 days, it started feeling easier so I felt like I could jump to Level 3. Level 3 had butt kicks, walking push-ups, Supermans, boxing with weights, sit-ups, jump squats, etc.

Theres two girls on the tape, one harder and one with modifications and I did follow the modification one sometimes - I didn't always do the hard girl even in Level 1. In Level 3, I switched the rockstar jumps with high knees and kicks just because again, I had jumping up and down. worked out in the mornings because if I try to do it after work I will not do it.

RESULTS: My watch feels looser, I have more energy, my pants feel looser, my stomach isn't as protruding when I lay down in bed. Im still not down to my goal weight of 150. I do think that I lost a lot of weight because I was not doing anything before AND because I have more to lose (if you're already smaller this will help you with toning), but I do credit this video for getting me off my butt and melting some easy weight off of me. I will continue using this DVD and will update my review if something changes.

Hope this helps! You can do it! Make it through 10 days and then youll be unstoppable!",1518739200,71,2278,4.096412556053812

Day 1: Wow. Level 1 is such a difficult workout for someone who is out of shape. I was so gassed by the end. My heart was pounding during each 2 minutes of cardio. I definitely couldn't do a decent push-up, even on my knees. My arms were dying by the end, My legs were wobbly on the lunges. I thought to myself, ""How will I ever be in shape for Level 2?!"" I decided instead of focusing on the things I can't do, just stick with it each day and see how much I improve in 30 days.

Day 7. Jillian is right! By day 4 or 5 I could tell a huuuuge difference. My body is adapting! Cardio feels like a walk in the park compared to day 1. I can do about 6 legitimate push-ups, although still on my knees. I can't wait to see how many push-ups I can do by the end. I continue to do more and more each time, increasing my hand weights and going deeper into the moves. I can't believe I am saying this, but I think I'll be ready for Level 2 by day 10.

Day 11: My first day of Level 2 is exactly how I felt on Day 1... like I wanted to die. For most of the moves, I was back to following Anita. Somewhat discouraging because I went in feeling so confident and that I was ready for Level 2 and it quickly reminded me that I have way more work to do. I definitely could not keep my butt down throughout all of the plank exercises, but I look forward to seeing what I will be able to do 10 days from now.  I keep telling myself to ""trust the process"" and just do my best. I can already see my body starting to change in the mirror. Working out everyday and trying to eat healthier is heading in the right direction.",1515196800,28,1698,3.898843930635838
3078564,5,B00127RAJY,"30DS delivers incredible results. I started out at 168lbs. with a goal weight loss of 28lbs. I had just had my second baby by cesarean and never really worked out prior to trying this. This DVD got me to 140lbs. in about 3 months.

The modifier was a lifesaver. I was awful on day 1. My fitness level was very poor and the workout was difficult. I had to take breaks during the cardio and was dripping sweat. I stayed on Level 1 for way longer than 10 days because it was so hard that I just wasn't ready for Level 2. I think after about 6 weeks I began to progress to the next levels.

If you stick to a diet and do this at least 5 days per week, results will come in literally just days. After week one my legs were firmer and my core was stronger. Bending over to pick things up was easier. It was like I had an extra spring in my step. Just after week one! I was back in my jeans so fast and they fit me better than before with my legs and butt filling them out in all the right places.

3078596,3,B00127RAJY,"I've been spoiled by Jillian's other DVDs.  I came to this one when I was running out of Jillian Michaels workouts to buy (I have almost all of them).  I was really disappointed with the production quality.  The music is too loud, it's hard to hear her, and their clothes and environment are very plain.  Beyond the production value, the segments are surprisingly unbalancedpart of the workout will feel really easy, and another part too hard, rather than alternating the two in a perfect harmony of challenge and recovery time, which is so common in her other DVDs.  I tried the workouts once and went back to Ripped in 30 as my main full body shredder.  I do 2-4 Jillian Michaels workouts a day when I have time; there's no time to waste.

Skip this more famous DVD and get Jillian's newer ""Ripped in 30"" instead.  Same idea, much better production and workout balance.

And, in case you didn't know this: Jillian Michaels is the queen of workout DVDs.  My progress is so fast on these that the people around me take notice within a week of me starting a new Jillian regimen, and I feel incredible!  Over the last 10 years, I've used these to tone up, lose weight, gain energy, recover from injury, etc.  If you tried 30 Day Shred, though, and didn't like it, just know these early DVDs are her roughest.

Skip 30 Day Shred, No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and 6 Week Six-Pack, and go for anything and everything else.  My favorites are Ripped in 30 and the Killer series (Killer Arms & Back is my nirvana).  Also, if you've slipped out of exercise for a while or need the basics, Beginner Shred is excellent.  It will transition you right into Ripped in 30.  I strongly recommend starting with one of these.",1511654400,4,1730,4.529032258064516

And I'm suprized at how I'm not sore after or even later in the day I didn't get stiff. The cool down really works Good workout get heart rate up and a lot of sparkling (sweat)

Pros
DVD is easy to use exercises are not hard and she gives you time to get to the next exercise before moving on. She gives you safety tip so your not hurt yourself.  Good price

Cons
Start the DVD and then get your shoes on and wieghts ready and a drink quite a few adds before the menu actually shows up and there's no skipping. The first time I can see but when your watching it every day you'll have it memorized in a week lol

Second thing is she does cuss by saying the words ass which I didn't appreciate this because my young kids like to exercise with me and I would rather them not hear that.",1511136000,,952,4.074866310160428

My parents had this DVD so I thought I'd give it a shot. Jillian really whips your ass into shape and fast! I've always tried stuff like Zumba, but it never did anything for me. With this DVD I was seeing results within the first week. I did it this past summer, every day Monday-Friday as well as keeping my calorie intake below 2,000 (I typically would be at 1,200 calories per day).

This workout is nice and quick and pretty easy for me to fit into my schedule. I have been alternating it with the 21 Day Fix.

3078662,2,B00127RAJY,"I wish so, so much I could leave a positive review. I followed this routine carefully, ensuring I followed all safety recommendations and not pushing myself too hard. I am a 25-year-old woman at a healthy weight who had previously been running four times a week, so I was not out of shape. As recommended/required by Jillian, I did the program every day. I ended up developing tendonitis in my knee by Day 22, which my doctor stated was due to the high demands of the knees in this program combined with absolutely no rest days. I had previously had no problems with my knees, even when running. It has taken me months of expensive physical therapy to reduce the pain and regain use of my knee.

I gave one extra star because I believe if you ""broke the rules"" and did this program every other day, it could be great.",1510272000,2,817,4.410596026490066

3078713,1,B00127RAJY,"Dont do this video. I never ever have had problems with my ankles- never- not even a sprain- and now I have some kind of tendinitis in both. I cant exercise for most likely weeks now maybe months. I am really injured and it hurts all day. Plus you don't lose weight. You will get toned. But not weight loss. Not one pound lost and I did 2 levels some days.  If you do the video don't do everyday. Switch up. I am in good shape and have about 15 pounds I want to lose. I started video almost 6 days a week. After 2 weeks Im injured from the pounding on my ankles. And 0 pounds lost. Toned yes.  I used to run and be an athlete. Ive never had anything like this and I am in my thirties. Im not overweight and Im not old and I am athletic. So I did everything proper form, I stretched more than shown and I did to my ability.  I should have just started jogging instead of this. And she is a bit annoying. Not encouraging at times when could be more encouraging. People that lost weight- read their posts- they usually jogged too and were eating differently. And surprisingly my knees ok though I kept thinking this kinda rough on knees. Think about it- Jillian would never do this for 30 Days straight. She would switch it up. Other videos usually switch it up too. You don't pound knees and ankles everyday, nor lunges everyday.",1509494400,,1327,4.196078431372549
3078714,4,B00127RAJY,"So I've done many of the Jillian Michael's workouts, but this was my first, and I think it's the best. It will kick your butt. It's my go to when I need to tone up a bit (I don't really need/want to lose 30 pounds, let alone in 30 days.)  I've done it multiple times over the years and pretty much every time my body aches after day one, but this last time, it wasn't so bad. Perhaps I'm finally getting better! And it's not just for chicks. I badgered my husband into doing it with me and I'm pretty sure we he agreed he was like, ""Ah, sure, I'll humor her by doing her ladies workout,"" and boy was he shocked! He also had muscle soreness for a few days afterwards and now he also uses this from time to time as a quick butt kicking workout.

Things I like about the workouts include:
1.) The length! They come in at just under 30 minutes including warm ups and cool downs so they aren't a massive time suck.  The downside of this is that you don't burn a ton of calories during such a short workout (I come in a just under 200 according to my fitbit-I'm 5'7 145lbs and usually my max heart rate for the work out is 160).
2.) It's very focused on strength training and overloading your muscle groups. I mean, I friggin' hate push ups and all the variety of plank exercises that she keeps making me do and depending on the workout either my shoulders/back/arms or my thighs (but usually my shoulders) are killing me when we finish. In workout two it's like a complete blitz on the shoulders with planks being in the cardio and the abs and some tough shoulder stuff in the strength training. I think this helps build muscle and tone quicker.
3.) The workout never gets easier. I mean, ideally it does. But you can keep it tough by moving up to follow Natalie (the more advanced movements) or by adding heavier weights to the exercises as you get stronger.

Things I don't like:
1.) The overloading work on the muscle groups, while effective, I think can also cause more injuries as you become more exhausted and your form suffers. I try to keep pace with Jillian and co. but sometimes will realize that I'm not keeping my back flat or I'm extending my knee over my toes and I have to back off (especially during the pendulum and jumping lunges. I have terrible balance and can't keep their pace with good form at all.)
2.) You are supposed to do ten days in a row for each set without breaks until you hit thirty days (I believe). I don't think that's very safe. Your muscles need time to recover. These exercises are intense. I usually take a break after day 5 or so (sometimes more often or sometimes I'll do the full ten without a break.)
3.) It gets monotonous doing the same thing ten days in a row. On the one hand, I do like to see how I progress. On the other, I can get bored.
4.) These exercises are very squat and lunge intensive. In other words, very hard on your knees. In workout three she adds a bunch of plyometrics which compounds the knee work/pressure. I've been doing this dvd off and on for about ten years (and I will go a year or two without doing it at all, don't get me wrong) but I definitely notice it in my knees more now (I'm in my late 30s). If you have knee trouble, this might not be the dvd for you. I think you would have to modify like 80% of the exercises.

As for results, you definitely need to follow a sensible diet plan for any significant weight loss. You can't do this and eat like crap and lose 30 pounds in 30 days.  Usually I will pair it with a diet of some sort, but this time I'm not changing my eating at all. I definitely notice increased strength and definition in my arms and my tummy. I haven't really lost weight this time, but I'm not really trying to. When I watch what I eat and do this and try and get 10,000 steps a day, I definitely lose weight. I would just say, don't get discouraged if you can't do the whole thing right away. It's legitimately hard. I still can't do a real push up! But I keep trying. Some day I'll get there. :)",1509408000,2,3993,4.192708333333333

I just read the description of the DVD and decided to give it a go. I do find Jillian's constant chatter annoying, but I just use Bluetooth headphones and listen to music to drown her out. The reason I docked a star is because the DVD has a loooooong intro that you can't skip! I used to start the DVD and then go change into my workout clothes, set up my mat and grab my weights and it *might* have been ready to start. I accidentally found a way around that though. If you have a DVD player that remembers where you left off when you hit play, you can start the workout and hit stop. Then when you play it the next time, it starts right at the beginning of the workout. This has saved me so much time.

Pros: It gets your heart rate up.
It's challenging.
Cons: LONG intro you can't skip after the first time. When I'm ready to work out, I'm ready.
Not enough ab work for my tastes.
Too much jumping around all shoved together.
Not long enough of a workout - I feel like I need more when I'm done.
Always, ALWAYS gives me calf cramps (and no, I'm not dehydrated) making me pause for a minute while waiting for them to abate - which throws me off my game.

3078842,5,B00127RAJY,"I thoroughly enjoyed this workout. It's true you can watch it for free on youtube, but it's constantly getting flagged and removed. The 8 bucks were worth it to spend for the consistency alone.

You're going to notice a change in inches by doing this workout by itself, but if you want to see the numbers drop down on the scale you need to drink more water, eat healthier and possibly add an additional ten minutes of cardio. Nothing major, just a short run or a few minutes jumping rope as a warm up will do. I also recommend 5-6 days working out with this DVD and 1-2 days of yoga or something more low key. I personally really like Jillian's style but if you don't, you can always mute her and put on your own music once you get the routine down.

As a stay at home mom/student, I don't have a lot of time to fit exercise into my schedule. Warm up and cool down included, the entire thing is about 25 minutes. It's quick and dynamic enough that I don't get bored doing it. And most importantly, I feel like I'm getting a lot of bang for my buck; the results are definitely worth the 25 minutes of work. The best part? My three-year-old likes to do it with me. He says it's so much fun, and while he's still developing his fine and gross motor skills, he sticks with me through the whole thing so it's turned into a bonding thing/fun way for both of us to get moving. So for anyone with little guys at home, don't let that deter you.

3078902,1,B00127RAJY,I usually love Jillian Michaels but I just cannot believe this. I started this video and was very skeptical at first because every single movement she makes aside from ab work is bad for your knees. And that was just level 1. Then I moved up to level 2 and I could not believe my eyes. Every single movement was jumping bending high-impact movement on your knees. She is literally expecting people that are overweight to put all of their weight on their knees and not get injured. I am blown away I am so disappointed and I'm writing this review as a warning. I don't even have bad knees normally period but after 2 weeks of this video I'm worried I've done some serious damage. Not only that but I don't see any results at all.

3078948,4,B00127RAJY,"I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who is trying to get back into working out - or who is starting to work out for the first time. When I started the video I was between 155-157 lbs.  I actually gained weight and was up to 160 lbs. (building muscle blah blah blah - I still felt crappy that I'd worked so hard and gained weight), and ended at 152 lb.  While I only lost about 3-5 lbs. I know for a fact that I lost inches all over.  I should have measured before I started, but I honestly didn't know what to expect.  This last weekend - after 35 days doing the shred - I was able fit into clothes that had been sitting in storage for three years! I took a star away from my review because by the third circuit JM is REALLY annoying to listen to.  She talks constantly!  We tried to switch it to the audio option where you can just listen to the music and not hear her talking, but there is absolutely no signal to tell you when to switch to the next exercise or circuit....which means you are stuck with JM annoying the crap out of you for twenty minutes.",1502755200,9,1071,4.100478468899522

I work out 6 days a week, and have been *loosely* following the meal plan lol and I have already lost 7.5 lbs  I love the circuit workouts and there is literally no excuse I can justify not completing a 20 minute workout each day! I think I plan to incorporate these workouts even after the 30 days :)",1501977600,5,379,3.9220779220779223

3078952,4,B00127RAJY,"I'm not going to lie to you.... this is 20 minutes of hell! It is early days and I'm sure it will get better as the days go by though. Today is my first experience with this DVD and I have to say, I can't see why anyone wouldn't lose a fair amount of weight by following this with a sensible diet. So far I'm pretty impressed, I like the way Jillian Michaels encourages you along and her directions are easy to follow and not annoying. I want to lose about 10 pounds and generally be fitter and feel better in myself, I feel like this workout will get me there. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars at the moment is that, like with what other reviewers are saying, there are a lot of lunges and jumping jacks etc and I felt a bit of a pain in one of my knees near the beginning... I did adjust the way I was doing these moves a little bit and it seemed to stop the pain.... so I most likely wasn't doing them correctly somehow... maybe... will see how things go.",1501718400,2,962,4.015625

I'm not one of those people that enjoys the social aspect of the gym. In-fact I completely keep to myself and sometimes feel a bit awkward there. I turn bright red and sweat very profusely when I exercise and the embarrassment from that holds me back from going all-out in front of strangers.

Doing this workout in my living room allows me to not care at all what I look like while exercising. I can turn tomato red, sweat buckets and only my family members know. I don't have to hound my kids to get ready and take them to the gym childcare just to exercise.

I just did level 3 for the first time last night and it was literally the most challenging thing I have ever physically done. I actually visibly see a small change in my body today from a single workout!",1501545600,,913,4.364705882352941

I have a better body at 44 than I have ever had in my life.  Jillian Michaels is not only an outstanding fitness instructor, she is an inspirational woman.  I like her ""no BS/no excuses"" attitude in workouts and in life.  And her constant reminders that the hardest part of the workouts are the moments when your body transforms the most.  I actually find this lesson to apply in so many areas of life - especially as a parent.  Being a rock for your kids in the most difficult moments is what help your kids to learn, grow and transform the most.  I am also grateful to her for also saving me ALOT of money and time at the gym!  Love working out at home on my own schedule.  You rock Jillian!!!",1501372800,2,816,4.146496815286624

It's based on a 3-2-1 method of Strength, Cardio, and Abdominal exercises which helps the body adjust to new, intense movement. There are modified versions but if your a BEGINNER, I do suggest the 30 Day Beginner Shred.

I'm 51 years old and have to make slight adjustments as she recommends but get a great workout in a time frame that fits my lifestyle.

3079037,5,B00127RAJY,"I love this workout! I ordered it on Amazon video so I can stream it wherever I go and I really like Jillian Michael's training style. She encourages you and more importantly explains WHY you are doing the moves you are doing. She's tough but she motivates you to give it your best.

I do this video 3 days a week (M/W/F) because I do Pilates the other two days (T/Th). Another thing I do is rotate which level I do for the day, there are three. So one week I'll do 1, 2, 3 then I'll rotate and do 2, 3, 1, then 3, 1, 2 then repeat. I think it's a good idea to always keep your muscle memory guessing for the best results.

This video is challenging and I do flip Jillian off occasionally but that means it's working and I'm always sweating after my workout!

Another thing to note is there are two other women for you to watch that do the moves with you; one for the advanced movement and one for modified movements if you're just starting out.",1499817600,3,945,4.125

3079039,2,B00127RAJY,"I loved LOVED the 30-Day Beginner Shred. I mastered all the hard modifications in about 60 days and was excited to see if I could do the classic 30-Day Shred. The answer is just because I can doesn't mean I should. Holy joint pain! I'm 34 years old, 120 pounds, 5'8"", in good shape. Doing this DVD for a month destroyed my knees first, then my hips. I'm very careful to follow directions, listen to my body, wear the best shoes, etc. (I regularly go for one-mile runs and never run into joint problems.) Not only was all this hard-impact jumping bad for my body, it was not fun. At the end of the workouts I really didn't feel the good soreness in my muscles, not like I did with the Beginner Shred! It was like we wasted so much time with stupid jumping cardio that half the good strength training was cut out. It is really frustrating to have to take days off from working out because you don't want to hurt yourself. I'm going to go back to the low-impact Beginner Shred and add some more modifications to make it harder -- that's one good thing I'm getting from this DVD, a few more strength modifications I can take back to the Beginner Shred. Maybe you don't need low impact, but now I know that I do.",1499644800,12,1207,4.275109170305677

I'm 53 years old, and I do the modifications (In some cases, I even modify the modifications.  HA!).  Sometimes I use 3 lb. weights, other times I use 2 lb.  I have knee issues, so I will do modified butt kicks, jump ropes, and jumping jacks. I love the fact that these workouts are 30 minutes, which is perfect for my morning, before work fitness routine.",1499126400,,475,4.425287356321839

Don't give up when you're sore, keep at it... it'll get better, I promise. I haven't seen much weight loss, but have loss inches and I can tell my endurance is much better.

Can't wait to do round 2 when I finish the 30 days to see if I can do all the workout without doing the modify version.

I would highly recommend taking a rest day after 4-5 days of workout before continuing. Jillian Michaels is tough but good tough. She gives you that extra push and motivation you need when you feel like you can't do it anymore.",1499040000,,672,4.083333333333333

Level one is basic - nothing is terribly challenging, and it will get your muscles used to moving.
Level two is (I think) the most difficult. When I would do all three back to back, I would have to do it first or I would be too burned out to finish it.
Level three feels like an achievement, which makes it so much fun.

I recommend this to my friends who need a jump start to fitness, though some of the moves are a little high impact for people who may have knee, hip or back issues.",1498435200,2,752,3.980132450331126

Some background, I'm 45yo, 5'5"" and normally between 125 and 135, 145 is my max number- you know, the number that wakes you up and says, ""WHOA! Stop the chips!"". I do not work out and in all honesty I am/was skinny fat. In June of last year I started cross fit, stuck with it for 8 weeks until September, went away on vaca and had an unrelated injury when I returned & never went back to cross-fit. That is the extent of my lifetime work out history. My daughter went to college on the other side of the country in August and since then I have steadily gained (freshman 40 for mom), but worse- I simply didn't care. I went up to 175, my heaviest EVER and felt like ""eh, I'm 45, all moms are fat at 45"". (Not true btw) and it didn't hurt that it was winter. Now- 175 and nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, fits and summer is fast approaching.

My girlfriend turned me on to Jillian Michael's when she showed me her before and after pics after doing Body Revolution. She and I have always run neck in neck with our weight (although not recently) and we have the same build, so after seeing her Incredible results in only a few weeks, I had hope. Knew I could never do Body Revolution with no prior working out, and wasn't interested in spending that much money if I failed to commit, which I'm famous for. So I am trying this video, the price literally can't be beat, esp if you buy on Amazon prime TV.

4/21/17 Today is day 4- I know- you probably expected me to say I am done with it but no. I'll update as I go along. But so far I have gone from 175 to 170 (I started eating better 2 days before starting video). First 3 days I literally couldn't walk, sit, get up, climb stairs, etc. This morning something happened, I woke up and immediately noticed I felt better, soreness had alleviated tremendously and I was able to get out of bed and walk like a normal person - well 80% anyway. Had a cup of coffee and did my workout and before I knew it, it was over. Incredible. Prior to today it has been torture, counting down the minutes and today we were cooling down in what felt like 10 minutes. So I want to tell everyone- don't let the soreness scare you away. It will pass and level one will get easier, if not easier, at least faster... I don't have much to say beyond that as I am only in day 4, but I hope to update this post with some great before and after pictures in the next month or two.

Food wise I am having a coffee first thing am (milk and sugar, I WILL NOT skimp on my coffee), protein shake immediately after working out, Medifast meals/bars 2-3x throughout the day 110 calories high in protein (that's another story altogether), grilled/baked chicken with steamed or sauteed green vegetables, 1/2 apple and peanut butter or a handful of almonds as a desert/snack. Obviously nothing else but water throughout the day, but I do cheat with my 1 glass of wine in the evening, although have switched from white to red as per my old cross-fit instructors direction.

I'm writing the review because I know for me, an extremely non-athletic person, I very much need to read reviews and look at before and after's daily to keep motivated, although looking at my before pics seem to be motivation enough, however they are pretty depressing, so better to look at others who've succeeded. I intend to post mine someday soon.
Good luck to everyone!",1492732800,22,3624,4.269286754002911
3079347,4,B00127RAJY,"I wanted a jump start to bathing suit season and this looked like a practical way to get started. It was a lot more difficult than one would assume when they watch it. It is a good balance of cardio and strength training and the only equipment needed are hand weights and a floor mat (if you have hard floors). It got my heart pumping and I definitely woke up sore the next day. I like the fact that it is broken down into 20 min segments so you build up to doing an hour over the course of a month. That way if I don't have an entire hour, I can still do 20 or 40 mins and feel like I got a good workout.",1492646400,2,605,3.8095238095238093

Even though I'm a consistent user, I still struggle through the jumps at the end of level three -- this is tough stuff -- but the intervals are short enough, and Jillian's patter consistent enough, that I'm able to push myself to finish. I love that there's enough variety here that it's still interesting, even after I've done it dozens of times.

3079406,5,B00127RAJY,I did this like a year ago and need to bring it out again. I would come home from work and do at least 20 minutes of the video. At first I couldn't get up off of mat fast enough to start jumping jacks but would try to keep up. I'm on my feet all day and have knee problems so I still jog in place and flap arms instead of the jumping jacks. But I lost inches and weight fast. I'm 5 foot and I started at 178 and got down to about 156. I'm still on the 1st workout on the tape because the other workouts are out of my league. I never really stopped eating same foods but did add CLA to my vitamin regime.,1491609600,6,603,3.71875

3079411,5,B00127RAJY,"After having my son, it took me a year to lose 14 lbs. Thats when i decided to try something new, 30 day shred. I took my before photo after the very first workout i did.
I changed my lifestyle a little as well. Im a life long vegetarian, but decided to eat a vegan diet (no dairy), cut out most processed food and eat whole foods as well as get rid of refined sugar. We all know we cant out run a bad diet.
I did the program for 30 days and never advanced to level 3. I found it too hard, so i did level 2 twenty times instead.
In the morning and evening i would walk a couple of miles with my son.
In just 4 weeks i lost 13 lbs! I know i didn't JUST do the dvd everyday, but in combination with everything, i feel it really helped me tone and build muscle. I have continued on to other JM dvds and have fallen in love with her workouts!

I am 29, 5'4"" 120 ish, I was looking to get back to my 110lb weight and be toned again.
The first workout was KILLING my calves, my massage therapist said they felt inflamed. They were definitely not normal workout sore. So till they healed i couldn't do some moves, specifically jump rope. Halfway through level 2 my knees started hurting, which of course is more concerning. My shoulders joints hurt too but my knees were really bothering me. I decided to move on to another program mid workout on day 18 because I felt I was harming my body. I was even combining this with a gentle streatching/yoga routine every day.
That's great it works for some people! I just feel doing the exact same exercises every day puts too much stress on those body parts. I also haven't lost any weight, I've actually gained a few lbs, though I do feel better and I can see the muscles building. But so far no weight loss.",1490918400,,1006,4.413978494623656

I give it 5 stars because it worked for me. I do run 3 times a week, plus this 4 times a week and I feel like I am keeping strength in my 40s. Level 1 is hard to start with (straight into pushups), so I advise jumping around in the levels to keep from getting bored and to cross train. In the first few weeks I had to rest when I couldn't keep going but gradually stopped taking rests. Also, after years of doing this, I listen to books on tape while working out instead of listening to Jillian. I know what to do. It's hard enough that it never seems to get easier, even though my muscles are better at the exercises. It keeps me toned and feels like actual work. Do the work and you will be stronger.

Holy Moly, when I started the first day I thought I might die before I made it through the 20 minute video. However, I made it through level one and stuck with it. I didn't end up doing 30 consecutive days due to illness and life but I did 30 workouts in 36 days. I didn't monitor my weight since that wasn't my main focus but I did notice a flatter stomach and more defined arms/shoulders. The best thing for me was that it strengthened my core significantly. I have had chronic back pain since I had my son and this REALLY helped decrease my back pain by strengthening my core. I finished the program a month ago but I am still doing the workouts 3-4 times a week to maintain my new strength and muscles. I cycle through the different levels. My advice to anyone attempting this program is KEEP GOING! It will suck sometimes, especially in the beginning but don't give up just do the easier modifications of the moves and try not to take more than 5 second breaks.

In this video, she is straight forward, in some of her other workouts that followed, her personality comments are more over-the-top; I prefer the methods she used in this video.  Her 3, 2, 1 system with the integration of toning, cardio, and abs creates a nice blend.  I agree with the others that you cannot skip the opening information, which is annoying.  Also, once you become familiar with the workouts, you can make quicker transitions to each set.  She takes a few seconds introducing the next move.

Although I am at the starting gate, two of my co-workers recommended it to me. You can see results. They both lost weight and inches. One has developed some abdominal definition & the other has biceps that are becoming defined and ""hard"". Jillian is motivating and energetic.

3079528,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD because I liked the idea of being able to get in a good workout in 20 minutes.  I am a mom with two young children, work from home, and generally have a lot to get done in a day.  I knew that getting to the gym regularly (especially during the winter when my kids get sick and can't go to the daycare) wasn't going to happen.  I didn't have enough time in my day for that.  After putting off getting back on the work out wagon for a long time, this seemed like a good fit. I committed to doing it for 30 days, taking breaks only once a week.

My activity level prior to this was minimal.  I played with my kids and carried them around, but that was about it.  As far as weight goes, I am barely considered overweight from a medical standpoint, and most wouldn't say I was overweight by looking at me.  I decided going into this that weight loss was not my goal. I didn't weigh or measure myself.  I wanted to feel better and stronger -- so that was my focus.  I did take one picture of myself on the first day just to see if I noticed any difference.  What I did notice from the before and after picture was minimal -- but what I felt was huge.  Today I completed my 30th workout.  I did 10 days on Level 1, 10 days on Level 2 and 10 days on Level 3.  The first few days of level 1 were hard.  I could barely make it through the workout and was sore all day long.  Now, as long as my blood sugars didn't drop (I am a Type 1 diabetic), I can make it through Level 3 doing most of the more advanced level moves.  My body is stronger and more toned than it was prior to beginning -- which is honestly more than I expected.

I did my work outs in the morning.  I saw a huge increase in my energy levels.  I felt better.  While I would have sore muscles, Jillian does a good job of explaining the moves so that I didn't injure myself.  I modified exercises and worked towards doing the more intense versions.  Some days were harder than other, but I generally found if I forced myself to do it (even when sore and tired), I felt better by the end of it (once I caught my breath). All in all -- this is a good work out for what it is.  It's quick, you will sweat (lots), get your heart rate going and build muscle.  I have bought a few more of Jillian's workout videos and plan to make sure I keep getting at least 20 intense minutes of workout a day.  It may not be amazing -- but for someone like me who wasn't doing much before, it's a big improvement.",1489104000,7,2467,3.983673469387755

As for directions on doing this workout, I am not sure if during the unskippable 10 minute intro to the DVD there is any explanation of how often you are supposed to do these exercises but I tried to do them 4-5 times a week with walks.  I ended up having to actually go online to research it and came across the meal plan.  None of this information was provided within the DVD box or during any of the auditory instruction.

I really wanted to like this workout routine but I unfortunately didn't.  It does produce results but I found it so repetitive doing the exact same workouts two weeks at each level and there are only three workouts on this DVD.  I like to have some variety in my workouts and this just did not cut it for me on that level.  I would find myself wandering back to my Jessica Smith workouts one week into each segment.  Also, as an aside, if you live in an apartment, condo, or multi-family home this workout will probably not work for you as you will be doing a lot of jumping around and trust me, it will be noisy.

Now I don't want anyone getting the wrong idea, I do like other Jillian workouts and often do many of her free ones on YouTube, but this set of workouts to me was just lackluster and produced minimal results for my body.  I know I am already in somewhat good shape, but I really did not feel challenged and often times felt bored during the sessions.",1486944000,3,1570,4.288135593220339

I played the dvd 5 to 6 times a week and would usually add 30 minutes of cardio afterwards although this video combines cardio with strength training.  The video contains 3 workouts. Jillian coaches you the entire time and gives you encouragement along the way.  I have several other of Jillian's dvds and this is my favorite one.,1485734400,2,432,4.657894736842105

I have bad knees and some exercises truly just hurt, but what I have found helpful is doing some of the excercises that I learned in stage 2 and replacing some in stage one so that I am able to continue to move for the duration of the video.

She is just as tough and motivating through the screen as she is in person. I did this for 2 months straight and noticed a big difference. All I did was eat healthy and exercised with this video. I did give my self a cheat day once a week for all the hard work I put my body through however, I stayed within reason. If you give yourself a cheat day DO NOT go overboard.

She breaks this DVD into 3 levels, however if I am doing these workouts consecutively, I like to just alternate workouts rather than doing the same level day after day.

The downside is the music. You may want to play your own. :) It's a beginners workout but it does the job for us. We swap the levels around. It hits all the regions.

Let say I went to sleep well workout and woke up with a soar back hurting abs. I do hip abs  DVD and it good but this a different type of work out.

Also, Jillian is serious. She doesn't chit chat like other trainers. Just show me the workout and let me do it. That's exactly what she does.  I like Jillian becaue she's intense. No fluff. You do what she says and you'll get results. She doesn't have obnoxious music or make you look like a crazy octopus in her workouts. She has easy to follow moves and they burn! Get her DVDs.

3079985,5,B00127RAJY,"I have a love/hate relationship with this DVD.  It is so hard, but it's hard to deny the results.

I am halfway through the 30 Day Shred. I haven't done it everyday (I average about 5 times a week), but since starting it on October 6, I have lost 1.5 inches off my waist and 1.5 inches off my hips.  Note that this is only halfway through, so I would say that 15 sessions into it has yielded nice, quick results.  My pants are feeling looser and I feel SO much stronger.  I haven't done it everyday because it's hard on my knees, but it's strange because on the days I don't do it, I feel lethargic and tired - and on the days I do it, I have an amazing amount of energy.

I won't sugarcoat it - Jillian is a monster and I cuss at her throughout the entire workout, but again - if it's results you're looking for, you're not going to do any better than this, considering it's only 20 minutes.  I will assure you that you will be dripping with sweat by the time you're done with those 20 minutes...and you'll be so happy that you got through it.  Starting out, you will be very, very sore, but like others have said, the soreness goes away after about 3 or 4 days.  I suggest powering through it the best that you can - I find that movement diminishes some of the soreness.

The only issue I have with this video is how hard it is on my knees.  This seems to have slightly diminished as I get stronger, but if you're carrying around a lot of extra weight (like me), your knees will be sore - period.  I have started each level at beginner movements, GRADUALLY moving toward the more advanced movements, but there are just some things I can't do (plank jacks, for one).  You will still get in a really good workout if you follow the beginner movements - don't be ashamed of that at all!

All in all, I know Jillian means well...but this workout is TOUGH.  Be prepared to sweat, and be prepared to be sore (at least initially).  But, also prepare to see results - quickly!",1477612800,6,1969,4.196808510638298

It also doesn't let you skip forward in the DVD which I like because you can't cheat. It has 3 different levels-one each for beginners, intermediates, and the very experienced. Even the beginner one is challenging. Since starting this I feel so much better and the results are very noticeable, people give me compliments all the time now.",1476576000,,505,4.685393258426966

I run most days of the week, but on my non-running days, I like to do some strength exercises, and this video fits the bill. You do need to buy some free weights for this video. It is broken down into strength, cardio and abs.  I like that it works all these areas. I am only on Level 1 and I will try to get to a point where Level 1 is easy for me.  Then I will move on to Level 2. I did sweat a lot, and with 8 pound weights, it is still a challenge for me.",1476403200,2,626,3.573529411764706

I would say the tape is more for someone who isn't just starting out (like I was) I was so sore for the first 3 days! But it definitely gets you sweating. This video was a great alternative to gym. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because I'm not quite sure how I feel about jillian but over all she does know how to lead a great workout.,1476144000,,430,3.7888888888888888

This may have been an early video for the producers, but I wish they could somehow upgrade the video so we can REALLY just get into the SHRED section of the video... !
 I do really like the 20 minutes exercises once you can get to them, they are great but when time is short I just cant do this video.. and  switch to my cardio kick-box with Billy Blanks to get in my exercise routine...he gives  quick warm up and you get right to it.. WISH Jillian can do one like that... anyone have any recommendations with weight like this shred video please let me know!

3080058,5,B00127RAJY,"I was about 35 pounds overweight and lost 20 pounds after my first month of 30 Day Shred six years ago. Losing those 20 pounds gave me confidence and motivation and I lost the other 15 by exercising regularly and eating sensibly. Since then, I have held onto this dvd and it is my go-to workout when my scale starts creeping into numbers I don't like. In fact, I just started the program back up a couple of weeks ago and have already lost 8 pounds and feel better overall. I definitely start noticing a difference around the 3rd or 4th day and it motivates me to keep going. I love that the workouts are less than 30 minutes and the exercises aren't super difficult. I tried P90x and could not do some of the exercises, didn't have or want to buy some of the equipment required and the workouts were way too time consuming for me. While I don't end up looking anywhere near as fit as Jillian or her girls in the video after 30 days (you would need to eat, breathe, sleep fitness for that), I definitely feel more toned, my clothes fit better and my scale is a much happier number. I highly recommend this dvd and have.",1475280000,23,1119,4.283018867924528

It is short enough that it keeps my interest, and it's more difficult to come up with an excuse not to take 20 min to work out. For only being 20 min I have seen amazing results. My thighs, butt, abs, and arms have all toned up. It is not a ""bulky"" tone, I am definitely still slimming down while toning. After a month of doing it I do find myself rotating this with some of her other DVDs to switch it up. I definitely recommend. Even if you find yourself struggling in the beginning, keep pushing and stop when you have to.

3080160,5,B00127RAJY,"I purchased this DVD in March of 1989 after having gone many years without doing any type of weight training workout. I loved it from the start. It was so hard, I couldn't even do all the exercises in the 28 minute workout. I kept at it, though, and soon had Level 1 mastered. Two years ago I joined a gym and do an hour long workout 3 times per week, but still, 7.5 years later, come back to this same workout any time I can't make it to the gym. Sometimes I do it just to have a different workout, and it always makes me sore the next day. I probably still do it about 2-3 times per month.  I love it because it is short, covers all the major muscle groups, and gets down to business.  I have bought several other DVDs through the years, but always come back to this one. I recommend it to people all the time. I just looked up my Amazon history this morning to see how many years I have been doing it and decided to write a review. It has whipped me into shape and made me really stick with exercise for over 7 years! The only thing I don't love about it is the music, Since I know the routines so well now, though, I often turn the sound down and play my own. It is an awesome video for those who want nice muscle definition in as little time as possible. Oh, I also love that it is a cardio workout as well.  It definitely keeps your heart rate up. By the way, I am 52 years old now. However, my 3 teenage and 20 something daughters can't keep up with me on it. They have tried : )  I definitely recommend.",1472256000,8,1511,3.9768976897689767

3080389,5,B00127RAJY,"This workout will kick your butt. Even though I haven't stuck to it, I've seen 10 pounds worth of weight loss from doing it off and on over the course of a few weeks. I strongly recommend it. It's high intensity, however. It has modifications, but it is incredibly face paced. It requires dedication. If you've experienced any past injuries, it may cause them to flare up. I'm in my 20s and it kicks my butt. I have a lot of past volleyball injuries that it irritates, but it's definitely do able.

I do recommend giving it a shot. If it seems like to much, you may want to talk to a doctor about it. There's a good chance it may be too much. However, if you can handle it, I completely recommend trying it. It's never boring, and Jillian keeps you moving. You feel like you may never move again afterwards sometimes. Be sure to stretch before and after, and even soak in some epsom salt afterwards. Trust me, if you aren't in fantastic shape, you will be sore.

But if you stick with it, you WILL see results. Even though I haven't lost as much weight as I need to, you can watch your body change. You will tone up and build muscle during this. You gain weight before you lose it on this program, but just stick with it. Be sure to add portion control and healthier options, as well.",1469836800,4,1284,4.279835390946502

I loved the program. The sessions are challenging and effective, but only 20 minutes each! And the beauty of it, is that you don't have to drive to the gym to get an incredible workout. I did mine as a challenge. 30 days to get a jump start on getting a more toned figure. If you google the program, you can find fun calendars to track your progress. It is recommended that you take measurements before and after so you see your results. I did not do that. I only weighed myself and took the pictures, thinking I want to see what people see. I only lost 2.5 lbs in the 30 days however I lost 3% body fat ! ....then I quickly lost 3 lbs the few days after completing the challenge. I'm definitely leaner even though it may be difficult to see in the photo. Most importantly, I feel stronger ! I encourage anyone just thinking to try it to just do it! Even if you don't have proper form or you rest a bit in between, like me, you are guaranteed to be drenched in perspiration after 20 minutes (fat melting )",1469836800,81,1169,4.176991150442478

3080479,4,B00127RAJY,"The workouts are pretty good for somebody that doesn't have much time. I'm thin and fairly fit, but I needed a more regular routine and my kids don't really allow me a lot of time to work out. The 20-minute workouts offered here are what drew me in, and even with the short workouts, I do feel my strength and stamina improving. I use this video 2-3 times a week, mixed with running 2-3 times a week. I rarely do this workout on 2 consecutive days, and if I do I don't do the same level. I've found the workouts to be as challenging as you want them to be, and you can modify most movements to accommodate injuries/weaknesses/etc. I'm not out to lose weight, so there are times where I take a break or skip a part I just don't feel motivated for that day-- I'm especially not fond of all the push ups at the beginning of level 1, and the neck circle sin the warm ups make me dizzy! That being said, if you're somewhat fit and putting in some effort, you should progress fairly easily. Sticking to the ""harder"" versions of each exercise, I think I did level one 3-4 times before progressing to level 2. I haven't felt a lot of need to move up to level 3, but went through the first circuit once just to see what's on it. Level 3 is definitely a step up, so it's a good idea to spend some time at level 2 perfecting all that plank work!

My main issue with this is the DVD. There is no way to skip over the intro and just go straight to the menu to choose your workout. Then you have to go through 2 levels of menu. There's no reason anyone should have to watch the intro more than once. I use this time to set up my mat and weights, but I still end up standing around twiddling my thumbs waiting for Jillian to shut up so the menu will come on. For a workout that is supposed to be 20 minutes, adding on a bunch of extra time for the intro is annoying. Also, just to be precise, the workouts are 20ish minutes plus the warm up and cool down-- only an issue if you're crunched for time! Don't expect to start and finish in 20 minutes.",1469059200,4,2032,4.08

3080481,5,B00127RAJY,"I am an ultra busy working mother of two. In other words, I have next to NO time to work out. I really can't even manage 30 mins per day. So my husband and I worked out a deal where we switch off working out while the other tends to the kids. It has now been two months since I got this DVD and started doing the workouts every other day and I am down 10 pounds!!! I can hardly believe it! I'm sure I would have gotten quicker results had I been doing it everyday, but that just wasn't manageable for me. I started out with Level 1 and advanced from there and now I'm just rotating each time I work out. My point is that even if you can't fully commit to Jillian's program you will still see results just at a slower pace. I'm convinced Jillian's 20-30 minute 3-2-1 workout system is THE way to go if you don't have a whole lot of time to commit to physical fitness. Love Jillian!!!",1468972800,2,882,4.045714285714285

3080517,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is one of my favorite workout videos. There are 3 twenty minute workouts each getting increasingly difficult. I love that each workout is short so that when I'm pressed on time I can still exercise and feel like it counted. She says that one of these 20 minute workouts can replace hours of ""phoning it in at the gym"" and I think she's right! When I give it my all I can really tell a difference in my endurance and strength after only a few days.

I always start with workout one, and I do it for about 10 days straight. Then when I'm ready to move on, I go to workout two. I must be honest that workout two is my least favorite of the bunch. There are quite a few floor exercises that make me light headed and dizzy. The exercises work, though, so I force myself through them. There are modifications to each exercise and you can choose which helper to watch and follow- the easier gal or the more advanced gal. One word of caution though- there is no modification for jumping jacks! After awhile I was so proud that jumping jacks weren't as difficult as they were at first. I *almost* enjoy them now!

After about 10 days of two I move on to workout three, and it is so much fun. The exercises chosen for three are great. It's really quite hard, but if you go at your own pace, before you know it it isn't as challenging. I love that I can do this video in the privacy of my own home. My face gets really flushed when I exercise (it embarrasses me) so I'm glad not to have an audience like I would at the gym. I have lost quite a bit of weight by doing this workout video. When I am diligent, I see results really fast. No matter your skill level, this video can help with your fitness, and it's a lot of fun to boot.",1468368000,17,1750,4.129032258064516

They can not be copy and today some computers don't have floppy DC's, so if you want to travel and have them with you  is not possible.  Maybe she or Amazon should have a site and give a code to buy them and have them delivered to a computer, just as the books.

3080578,5,B00127RAJY,I am still at level one and I love it.,1466294400,,38,2.9
3080579,5,B00127RAJY,"My skill level: I am pretty good about doing a home workout DVD about 5-6 times a week. I have tried several of Jillian's programs, several in The Firm series, more Beachbody programs than I care to admit, and a few random ones for good measure (Billy Blanks, prenatal workouts, and a few Bellydance). That being said, I am not athletic. I hate working out but do so because it is the healthy thing to do. I would classify my level as ""lower level advanced"". I am certainly not a beginner but by no means am I a super toned athlete.

As a way to kind of organize my own DVD collection, I wanted to go through and rate them all so I can quickly grab exactly the kind of workout I am looking for that day, rather than try to think ""hmm, is this the good ab one or the good thigh one?"". Posting them here on Amazon for all to benefit from. Here goes:

This review is for the Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred. There is one DVD with 3 different workouts- 3 levels of essentially the same format. The idea is that you do each workout for 10 days. The first time I did it was about a year ago when I had just been cleared to start working out again after I had my son. At that time, it was free to stream on Amazon Prime until I finished the 2nd level but I loved it so much, I ended up buying the DVD.

Time: For each workout, the warm-up and cool down are about 2-3 minutes each. The actual workout is 23ish minutes, so you are looking at a 25-30 minute commitment from start to finish.

Skill Level: This program is perfect for a beginner or someone who is getting back into working out after taking a break. Though I had previously done workouts like Beachbody's ""Insanity"", that was not something I wanted to jump back into after just having a baby.

Though it doesn't seem it at the time, level 1 becomes easy as does level 2 (Still working on Level 3 but I am assuming it will get easier as well)! As with most of JM's workouts, there are always plenty of modifiers to make the workout harder or easier. If you classify your skill level as ""upper intermediate"" or ""advanced"" the first two levels will probably be too easy for you.

Equipment: You will need weights- I recommend a pair of ""light"", ""medium"" and ""heavy"", which, depending on your skill level will be different. For beginners I'd start with a pair of 3-5-8, intermediate would probably use 5-8-10, and advanced 8-10-15 (I used 5-10-15).

Breaks: No breaks. It is a short workout so she keeps you moving pretty much the whole time.

Format: Jillian uses her common 3-2-1 circuit formula: 3 minutes of strength training, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, then one minute of abs. I really love this pattern because it is a way to have a little of everything in a very predictable way. There are 3 different circuits and within each circuit (except abs) each component repeats 2 times.

Overall, I think this is a perfect 30 day program to use as an introduction to working out. I have done a bunch of different programs that range from 30 days to 15 weeks. The longer ones have more variety in workouts, yes, but that is a pretty overwhelming time commitment for someone just starting out on their journey. This program is simple (in terms of the schedule) and predictable (all workouts follow the exact same formula). Once you master this you will certainly want more variety but if you can stick to it for 30 days, you will have created a great daily habit of working out and will be 100% ready for the next level.

Personally, I still use Level 3 in my workout rotation when I am looking for a relatively short comprehensive workout (mix of cardio/strength/abs).",1466208000,3,3621,4.38301043219076

It's nice to have two 'levels' of almost all of the exercises so you can choose to do the modified version or the more challenging version, depending on how you are feeling.

I have tried a lot of exercise routines over the last two years but had a very hard time with motivation because change was so slow.  I was really frustrated. I started this about 6 weeks ago and I could see changes almost immediately.  It has been great for motivation and my strength has increased dramatically.  I have finally started to see a decline in my weight.  Would like to have seen that sooner, but at first, I added weight due to the increase in muscle and while I did not go on a diet with this, I found that the program itself has changed my food cravings.  I noticed that some have mentioned knee problems and I don't have those, but I did had issues with my left knee right after I started this.  I realized that when it hurt I was favoring it.  When I stopped doing that and continued to stretch it out during the day, the problem went away after about 2 weeks. I know my limitations too so there are some exercises where I stick to the modified version.  I have tried to maintain this at least 5 days a week.  If I got real sore, I took a day off. All in all, I love the results and I am just finishing up level 3.  I am so pleased I orders ""Ripped in 30"".

I appreciate the modifications that are given for the different exercises. (I am currently on level 2 and using most of the modifications - I still sweat like crazy!) I also like how Jillian Michaels isn't the overly bubbly positive cliche - she admits that the workout is difficult and you can tell that she and the other two women in the DVD are working hard. I've been doing the DVD well over the 30 days, and I hope to start Level 3 next week. It's awesome that all you need are a pair of weights and a yoga mat.

3080707,5,B00127RAJY,"Loved it. It took me a few different tries to actually start really doing it. I did it once and it kicked my butt. Then I did it a second time and could not make it through. Then I saw how much i weighed and knew I had to make a change. So I started doing it every day with 5 pound weights. I would do 3 days on 2 days off. The first 2 weeks, there was not much of a change, so I added in 10 minute HIIT 3 times a week. At the end of the program, I had lost 10 pounds. And my body pretty much transformed. I could see more definition, and tone, which means that I had transformed fat and into muscle (which as we all know, weighs more). I think the second level was the hardest but there is when i started seeing more fat burn off. Level 3 I started seeing more tone and lines on my abs. To loose 10 pounds in roughly 30 days is great. Once you really get into the groove of it, and start to memorize the work outs, its not that bad and ends up being a pretty quick 30 minutes. I highly recommend it for beginners.",1464048000,4,1014,3.81042654028436

I don't want to call it that because this is an INTENSE WORKOUT! But it's easier than some of her other stuff.
I like this because not only does she divide it into 3 levels but she gives you easier alternatives for the moves, So if you are out of shape you can still perform the entire workout. And just ALMOST die! haha

My biggest pet peeve about this DVD is that you have to watch the 'infomercial' at the beginning of the dvd EVERY SINGLE TIME you play it. There is NO WAY TO BYPASS it. DRIVES ME INSANE. I want to pop in a dvd and start my workout. I do not NEED an infomercial about biggest loser or Jillian's empire EVERY time I turn it on. BLEH.",1463011200,8,549,4.238095238095238

3080855,5,B00127RAJY,"Well, yesterday I finished day 30 of the 30 day shred. So, today I am ready to give my opinion and results. I am 39 and bought this video because it's time to get in shape after recently having a baby.  Oh yeah, and I never got in shape from the baby I had before the last one. When I started this video I needed to lose 60 pounds in order to reach my desired weight.

Results:
I will say that the results are very noticeable. Everyone keeps asking me if I have lost alot of weight. To be honest, I have only lost 4 pounds, which is disappointing, but it is obvious that I have replaced much fat with muscle. I have lost 1/2"" off my thighs, 2"" off my hips, 3"" off my waist, 2"" off my chest, and 1"" off my arms. My clothes fit much looser than they did 30 days ago and they look much better. Also, I have far more energy and endurance.

My diet:
I did not use Jillian's diet plan. In fact, I did not change my diet much at all. The only thing I have changed is that I have cut soda completely, but I only drank 1-2 sodas a week before starting the program. I also have begun to drink much more water. I messed up a couple of times and ate lots of movie theater popcorn. I cannot stop thinking about how this has impacted my results.

The video:
I really like this video. None of the moves are complicated. The only equipment you will need are some hand weights. You will start with level one and move on to level 2 when you feel ready and then the same with level 3. Each level has a brief warm up, 3 circuits, and a cool down. From beginning to end you will workout for 24 minutes. I will admit that I am not in the best shape, but I am certainly not in the worst. I found this video to be challenging. It took me a week to get through level 1 without pausing. I think I paused 7 times on day one. I honestly paused about 1 less time each day, until I finally didn't need to. I stuck with level 1 for 2 weeks. When I moved on to level 2, I did not need to pause at all. I read many comments about level 2 being the most challenging, but l LOVED level 2. I did level 2 for one week. I also did level 3 for one week. Level 3 is a killer and I enjoyed it less than the other levels, but I made it through without pausing the video.

My plan is to try a video each month (this one was my first), until I lose all the weight. Over the next month, I will be doing the Biggest Loser Cardio Max and then I will post a review with my results of that.",1461628800,20,2441,3.8642714570858283
3080856,5,B00127RAJY,"This is my second time purchasing this dvd! I am purchasing this as a gift for a friend because I am a firm believer in this work out plan. With dieting and implementing this work out two times a day- I lost 37lbs the first month & a half.

I cut added sugars, dairy, and carbs out of my diet. The work outs are short and really get your heart pumping... I sweat so much! I always find myself going back to this routine.

There isn't much I can add to the reviews for this dvd, but I will just say this: I ordered this dvd January 7th, 2016. I was able to do two pushups, half-hearted jumping jacks, and was wobbly just from workout #1 and after only doing workout #1. Now I'm able to use workout #1 (and her other dvd workout #1's) as my warm-up and incorporate other exercises. I'm also 19lbs down in less than 4mos (the healthy way).

3080941,5,B00127RAJY,"UPDATE - Hello my fellow workout junkies:) I never stopped working out since. I am currently weighing at 128 LB, toned and my endurance is fantastic. I simply workout 3 days a week, of course use a Jillian Michael home workout video - I have 8 of them and kinda rotate between one another but 30 day shred is always close to my heart and walk/run another day, drink a lot of water and don't forget to take my post workout protein shakes! A total lifestyle change. It all started with this DVD :) So pleased!!

Try it  you will not be sorry.

A little bit about myself (sorry long story, but I promise I have a point :)) - I had a baby 10 months ago and I gained almost 50 pounds during my pregnancy. I was a size 4, 128 pounds and 5 feet, 3.5 inches tall pre pregnancy and I went all the way up to 183 on my last few weeks of gestation. Post-partum, I did lose some weight (my body doing its own thing) and I hit a plateau when I reach 155 pounds. So I started my weight loss mission. I started with the juice masters 7 pounds in 7 days challenge. I read the book, I was totally committed and I completed the program. I lost 5 pounds which was very discouraging weight loss wise but I noticed my skin and my hair was thankful I did the detox. I then went and bought myself a stationary bike. I was scared to use the bike because I was 6.5 months postpartum and I haven't exercised in like 15 months. None  not even a long walk. So I would use the bike for 7 min and I would be out of breadth and had no energy to proceed. A friend suggested I do p90X (I know, dumb idea for someone who has no endurance what so ever!) Anyway, they make you take this fitness test which was painful and scary and I of course failed but that opened the idea and the possibility of a home workout DVD idea. After a lot of research and procrastination, I landed with the 30 day shred. In the meantime just trying to exercise and using the bike few times a week made me lose a few more pounds. I started the 30 day shred when I was 8.5 months postpartum and weighed 145 pounds. I completed level one and though I was going to die the next few days. I couldn't move because my muscles freaked out. I was in a lot of pain and my self-confidence was suffering but I didn't give up. I picked myself up on day 4 and completed level one again. Couldnt work out for the next couple of days but started again day 7, you get the idea. I kept pushing myself and I was in level 2 in another week and a half and in level 3 in another week and half from that. Its been 45 days and I am now 134 pounds, toned in areas I was only dreaming about and my endurance and energy levels have increased dramatically. Guess what, I took the p90x fitness test again (I had too) and yes I passed with flying colors :) Thank you Jillian. Next up  Get ripped in 30 days. Watch for my review there..soon.. :)",1459728000,5,2857,4.031746031746032
3080942,1,B00127RAJY,"I was so excited to try this workout.  I am out of shape and this dvd was described as a beginner routine.  The first level was very disappointing.  It was nothing but jumping jacks, (fake) jump roping and push-ups.  I don't need to buy a dvd to show me that.",1459641600,2,259,4.12

 sweating more than a hour at the gym.",1459382400,2,294,3.7419354838709675
3080944,5,B00127RAJY,"I have had this video for years and love to go back to it. When I am feeling like I need to tone up, I pop in Jillian and boom she sets me straight. It's only a 20 min video people! You can do it! Oh and don't think just bacause it is so short it will be easy. Nope. She keeps you moving. And you will be sore the first week. Follow through for 30 days and you won't be sorry. I promise. Great workout video to have in your collection.",1459382400,,435,3.739130434782609
3080955,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a fabulous DVD if you are looking for something quick and not too challenging. The workouts are under 25 minutes, so squeezing something in before work or adding a workout to a busy schedule is possible! It's covers your whole body, and includes some basic free weight work. I would definitely add in some more intense cardio and strength training to your workout routine, but this is great for people looking to get in shape, or more fit people looking for something quick to do on busy days. There are also three different levels, so you can choose between an easier workout and a slightly more strenuous option. This has been great for me as a new mom, trying to get back into shape and having limited free time.",1459382400,4,723,4.526717557251908
3080956,3,B00127RAJY,"It's okay. It will get your heart rate up and you will probably lose weight if you use this program.

I docked two stars for one simple reason: every time I do this workout, I inevitably end up with some kind of injury, either my knee or my back. I've used this program several times over the years - two babies, wanting to lose the baby weight, shape up for a wedding, etc etc. I know all about proper form, it's not that. There's some move that she does that if you have even a slightly sensitive low back or knees, you're likely to end up injured.

Also, Jillian Michaels knows nothing about building a feminine physique, if that's something you're worried about. She builds bulky quads and wide shoulders. It's fine if you're looking to quickly slim down; the areas she bulks you can fix with better programs (like Tracy Anderson, or Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful), but if you're looking to build a femininely toned body *while* you slim down, look elsewhere.

In short: this program is okay. If you don't get hurt, you will probably lose weight and build muscle in your legs and shoulders. But, if your goals are bigger than just lose weight ASAP, you can find better programs.",1459296000,2,1188,4.542056074766355
3080957,4,B00127RAJY,I am enjoying working out with Jillian. I think she is inspirational.,1459296000,,69,4.833333333333333
3080958,5,B00127RAJY,"I started this expecting nothing, mostly because I always told myself I had tried everything. To be completely honest I began many programs and never really stuck longer then 2 weeks tops. I tried running, and calorie restriction, weight watchers, and a ridicual amount of Beach Body workouts. I hated the Beachbody because they were so long and seemed to cause more soreness then results. There were so many addons and meals you had to pay for, I just got tired of it real quick. But this DVD went by quickly, I loved how there are three circuits, So by the second one I could tell myself half way through! The time flew, by the second week I told myself I am giving up. But I thought about it and thought I will stick it out. I didn't really see results until the middle of the 2nd week, by the 3rd week all my work pants were lose, by the 4th week everyone at my work had noticed and said ""Wow you have lost so much weight!"" I couldn't believe it! I was the one that had lost the weight! I didn't even follow the mealplan, I told myself I wanted to teach myself how to eat on my own without always following a diet, instead I eat almost all organic and hormone free food, and watch my portions. I try to eat 4-5 times a day. And avoid anything fake, and cook all of my meals. I am beyond impressed and feel so happy! I can't believe after years I actually saw a difference. I didn't weigh myself because I thought I would self sabotage myself and obsess about the numbers. But my clothes speak volumes! The pants I couldn't even wear last June, I had to dig out and wear because all my other pants were so lose! Now by the 4th week, those pants are lose too!!!!! I am so happy and proud of myself! I can't believe I did all 30 days. I worked out 6 days and one day off. I didn't even have wieghts because I couldn't afford them so I used bean cans, lol. They still worked! I did 10 days on level 1, 10 days on level 2, and 10 days on level 3.

If you are reading all the reviews and looking at as many before and after photos as you can just do it. Take the plunge you will not regret it. You will feel beautiful strong and that you can accomplish anything!! Do it!!!!!

I am now on my second day of the ripped in 30 and love it even more! I am hoping to finally get down to a size 7!!! and dress size 6!! I just need to tone a bit more and lose that last layer on my tummy! I really feel like I can do it and by the 30 day mark I will be amazingly pleased. I intend to combine the ripped in 30 with at least two days hiking, and sometime within the 30 days I will also throw in the one week shred, which I may do for 2 weeks to maximize my transformation and to get rid of that top belly layer. I haven't seen hardly any results or pictures for Ripped in 30 but, after the 30 day shred I am conviced. Really fitting into pants that haven't fit for over a year??!?!?!? and when I did wear them they were super tight on my abdomen. I can't wait to fit into those skinnny jeans I bought months ago. I actually tried them on and was able to button them, they are far too tight to wear them comfortably, but the point here is that I was able to get them past my thighs!!! and button them, which I couldn't before!!! :D Do IT!!!!!! You can do anything if you really want it, but not for anyone else, for youself! I tried to workout in the past in my mind I wanted to look better for my husband but, I never followed through. This time I'm doing it for me, and I actually finished it through and am so very proud!! Do It!! You won't be sorry",1459209600,14,3538,4.002828854314003

3081036,5,B00127RAJY,"I started the 30 day shred on New Years Day 2016. Since then, I have done this workout 5 days a week, and I spent 2 weeks at each level.

This workout kicks ass! Especially if you are a beginner like me. I feel like I get a great workout every time, and it feels amazing to see the changes in my body. I was relatively small to begin with (135 pounds, 5'4), but I dropped down to my goal weight of 128 using the shred and without changing my diet. (I don't drink pop, I have one coffee a day and then the rest is either water or unsweetened tea, I have desserts maybe one day a week -- so my diet wasn't terrible to begin with, but I haven't really changed anything).

The biggest changes for me have come in my ability to do things I couldn't do in the beginning. I went from not being able to do a push-up to being able to do 20 in a row. I went from being sore and winded every workout to feeling great every workout. These workouts really do amp up at each level, but they are do-able in this progression. I was sore the first few days after each new level.

Also, I personally love Jillian, so her personality has never been a problem for me.

Overall, I would highly recommend this to a beginner wanting to get in shape without devoting hours of your time. I am a doctoral student with very limited free time, but I have been able to fit this in! I feel more confident in myself than ever. Thanks Jillian!

3081081,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm a HUGE fan of JM and have a collection of her workout DVDs. I do this routine a lot and swear by it. Jillian gives great advice, talks about form, and gives modifiers to make the exercises either easier or harder, depending on your fitness level. This DVD has 3 levels of full-body workouts based on her 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs strategy (which TOTALLY WORKS). Quick full workouts saves me time and keeps me fit. I rotate a lot through her DVDs to fight boredom, and do lower levels with heavier weights, higher levels with lighter weights (or push hard on higher levels with heavier weights to keep my body guessing). When I workout consistently with her DVDs, I get a well defined 6 pack. Totally worth it and I highly recommend",1456704000,3,769,4.460992907801418

I shopped around for some fitness dvd to start working out at home in the mornings. I finally settled on the 30 day shred. Shipping was super fast and I was eager to pop it in and give it a try.  The only equipment you need for this are hand weights (dumbbells) and a yoga mat if you're going to be doing this on a hard surface. I love that I didn't have to run out and buy a ton of extra stuff. The dvd starts out with and introduction to jillian then you select from three workouts. Level 1. Level 2. And level 3. Today I did level one. By the time we were done I was sweating from head to toe! She starts off with some warm-ups then you get right into a variety of exercises then you do static stretches to calm down. Jillian has two women behind her. One you follow if you're like me and not in shape and need to start a little easier. The other if you're in shape but looking to work out at home. The exercises were simple but I'm sore already! I read alot of reviews saying people with previous knee issues couldn't do this because it was too strenuous. I will say I do not have knee issues but I think if you do this might be too much for you. It's alot of getting up and down. I really like this video and have high hopes for my goals while using this. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to lose weight and get in shape.

3081102,5,B00127RAJY,"I ordered 30 day shred after my best friend suggested it to me.  I noticed she was looking wonderful and I asked her what exercises she was doing.  She told me that she was using this DVD.  I ordered this in January 2015.  I have been using the DVD every morning for over a month.  At first I started on level one.  I noticed within a couple of weeks I was mastering it well, so I decided to go up to level 2.  I have been doing level 2 for the last 1 1/2 months.  I love the weight training and resistance moves.  They are not only allowing me to lose weight, but are adding muscle and trimming me down.  I have lost close to 10 pounds, and I am much more tone and fit.  I love the combination of strength and cardio.  I am not an exercise nut...I like to say I exercise so I can have a cookie later...Just to give you and idea of where I am coming from.  Great dvd...I am going to order another, more advanced Jillian DVD so I can improve even more.

Update, I just got on the scale this morning and have lost another pound.  I am using ""My Fitness Pal"" on my iPhone to log my calories, and walk the dog a couple times a day...but honestly, this DVD is my main work out.  I am now using 5 pound weights in each arm when I do the strength training.  That is making me work harder, but isn't killing me.  Keep in mind, I worked up to the 5 pounds.  I started with 2 pound weights.  My core is so much stronger, and I feel as if I can hold myself up better, sit better, walk better, and just feel so much better.  I plan on moving to level 3 in a couple of weeks if all things go well.  I will keep reporting how I do.",1456185600,7,1617,3.895705521472393

3081170,4,B00127RAJY,"I didn't have much of an opinion either way on JM before this video. After this video I really like Jillian Michael's method of coaching. She is motivating and to the point without being preachy.
Ok- so I bought this b/c I wanted to get back into shape. I have always been an athlete and ran/worked-out on/off for most of my adult life since I stopped doing competitive sports after H.S./College but needed something to get me back into it. I picked this up based on reviews and a good price/easy to do at home. I love the 3-2-1 method that keeps you going and mixes up the workouts and I love the truly fast 20 minutes b/c I have no excuses to do this 5-6 days a week. I wanted to tone and get stronger and hopefully lose about 5lbs. Now, after almost 3 full weeks I have lost about 2lbs and 1-1.5 inches from my waist and hip area. I definitely feel much stronger and have better endurance. This does work and I think if you stick with it and wanted to lose more weight than I am aiming for it would work, especially with a diet modification plan. I have not changed my eating at all but am still seeing some results. I will hopefully reign in my eating more so I can actually shed the 5lbs I would like to...maybe even more?!
Couple more things: Wish that each level offered 2 work-outs just for variation but I will say that each video offers a way for you to keep working but modify for your own needs. I have not great knees from years of wear and tear and I currently do have a torn rotator cuff so I am careful during some moves to really listen to my body- but overall I am able to do 85-90% of the workouts at my full capacity.  L1 I was able to complete confidently in less than a week and same with  L2. I then returned back to L1 and found it significantly easier after completing my 2nd full week (last week on L2)! So exciting to see progress. Also, I do find that L2 is a bit tough on the joints (shoulders/knees) due to the moves but L3 eases up on that but is much tougher on actual muscle toning moves with more resistance.
Overall I like this and will continue to do and probably get another one of her 20 minute DVD's to mix it up.",1455321600,7,2152,4.133651551312649

The workouts - man. If you are new to exercising, just keep going. I was DYING on my first day and took breaks and couldn't keep up. But the workout actually goes by really quickly. There are three rounds each consisting of 2 minutes of strength (push ups, chest press, shoulder press type workout outs), 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, butt kicks, jumping rope etc.) and 1 minute of ab workouts (different types of crunches or sit ups). The cardio part is what really killed me at first. Now I am able to jump around with them and not be too bothered by it. Of course, then it changes to the next level (there are 3) so you don't plateau.

I run and do other sports but this workout always sculpts my body so quickly.  Better than any other workout that I do.  Her training is AMAZING.  The results are worth the sweat.  This is a challenging DVD, but, you can make it as challenging as you want.  I never saw my body change with any other workout like it does with her type of training.  She is really driven and will make you work for it but I promise, you won't be disappointed.  It is 20 minutes.  You feel great (plus sore) afterward and will know you got more than your money's worth.  If you want a challenging workout that pays off, this is for you. (I am a regular person not an athlete.

3081278,5,B00127RAJY,"I have a few of Jillian's DVDs, and this is one of my favorites! It's a tough, fast-paced workout that will leave you sweaty and panting.

There are three 20-minute workouts, each with a different difficulty level. And although the moves are all simple and easy to understand, there is a definite difference between levels. Even the level 1 is pretty tough (and I consider myself very athletic and in good shape), and the level 3 is KILLER (don't try it before you do levels 1 and 2 a few times). You do short circuits of weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, cardio, and abs. It goes by so fast (and saves me so much time compared to going to the gym every day), but it is a serious workout and if you stick with it, you'll see results. I didn't need or want to lose weight when I started these, but after two months of doing them 4-6 times per week, I had dropped 5 lbs and a pant size. So I was very happy with it!

However, if you get bored easily doing the same thing over and over, this may not be the DVD for you. I really don't mind it, and I like to mix it up by doing the different levels, increasing my weight, or adding weights to the cardio part. But it may get tedious for some people.",1453766400,4,1198,4.181818181818182

Over eight months I lost 52 pounds, and this DVD played a big part.  (Of course, I now eat very healthily too.)",1453680000,6,356,4.042857142857143

I have worked with a trainer on and off for several years and this DVD is the closest one I've had that comes to the same actual type of workout you do with a personal trainer. The workout is pretty fast paced, but I found the first level to not be too difficult even for being completely out of shape after having a baby.  They even offer an easier and harder version of most exercises so you can take it to the level you feel comfortable with.

I knocked off one star because the commercials at the beginning when you start the DVD are annoying and will not let you skip to the main menu. I would recommend popping in the DVD and then go get ready for your workout so the DVD is ready to go when you are.",1453680000,13,738,4.041095890410959

I go to the gym about 4 days a week and do the about an hour on the elliptical, bike and weight machines.  My weight has plateaued and my endocrinologist suggested changing up my routine (I have hypothyroidism).  I picked up the One Week Shred that was on clearance and couldn't get through 10 minutes.  It was BRUTAL.  I remembered how effective this DVD was and decided to buy on amazon. Just started and it is as good as I remember.  20 minutes and I am done, sweating and feeling a good soreness in my muscles.  Even when I thought I was working out effectively, it is good to ""change things up"".",1453507200,,723,4.226277372262774

3081298,1,B00127RAJY,"Update: SO NOT AWESOME. I never did get the DVD to not play the commercials even with suggestions from other reviews. However, after working my way up to level 3, and doing jumping jacks with weights, I am now in physical therapy 3 times a week. The first time I saw Jillian do jumping jacks with weights, I did not follow. I have been weight training on/off most of my adult life and never have I done any type of aerobics with weights. I even told my husband I thought this was absurd and dangerous. Then I decided to try it, against my best judgement. And, I should have listened to myself. On top of now having bursitis and needing a cortisone shot in my shoulder, I cannot do any weight lifting or any type of exercise with my arms because I have damaged my shoulder doing this video. I DO NOT recommend doing any cardio with the weights!

This is not for content, but the fact that it takes forever to load every time. I have to sit and watch the commercials for the biggest loser, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I just want to start my workout, not watch commercials. I try to fast forward but it resets my DVD player and I have to start it all over again. Such a waste of time.

If you stick with it after only 2 weeks you will start to see results.  I feel firmer but I'm not getting on the scale for another 2 weeks so not sure about pounds.  I think it's going to take me longer because I just can't do some of the jumping due to bad knees and a bad back.  Sorry, Jill, I modify somewhat and do the best I can.  I don't cheat really, just substitute running in place as fast as I can which seems easier on the knees and back for the jumping in place, but I do every one of the jumping jacks.  I've knocked off a star because there really needs to be alternate movements given for those of us who aren't young or have injuries. What'ja say?  Go back to Jane Fonda you old thing??  No way!!

I think this is a fantastic dvd which works the entire body. Nothing was too difficult to follow due to ability or coordination. I know that everyone has a different body type and what is good for one may not benefit another but in abt 6 weeks I was able to drop 7 pounds. I did this 3 times a week and started being more careful with what I ate. (I love candy.) I was 137 pounds when I started 5'7 if that info helps to know body type. I put on weight everywhere not just one area. Anyhow, I really enjoyed this workout and that is saying something for me.

I couldn't move and had to be assisted to do basic tasks like using the restroom with my husbands help. Extremely painful and it took about 3 weeks to fully heal. I am not blaming it on this DVD but please be aware, especially if you have had children recently, you may want to strengthen your core first. I had three kids in 6 years, my core is shot which I think is what caused me\y lower back to give out. I am going to attempt this again AFTER I do her ab DVD in hopes I can strengthen my lower back and abdomen.

3081352,5,B00127RAJY,"I'd like to start off by saying that I rarely review anything on Amazon. In order for me to do so, I have to really like the product. I LOVE this video.
I have been trying to lose weight, but more importantly get fit. I don't want to be skinny, I want to be strong. Jillian's video will make you work! I am about 3 weeks in and I'm still on level 1. Not because I think that level 2 will be too difficult, I am confident I can do it, however I want to do all the advanced versions of the moves and I am gradually increasing dumbbell weight. I essentially started as a couch potato, which had about 20 Lbs to lose I'm 5'10'' tall. I did the first three days without any hand weights. After that, I began using water bottles, just for my hands to become accustomed to the weight. Now I am using 3 lb weights and I will go up to 5 lbs. As far as results go, I can honestly see huge improvement. First off in my fitness level, I panted when I began working out, now I pant less. I still curse every single time I do jumping jacks, however, I do them without stopping. Secondly, I see a change on my clothes and inches lost. I lost about 3 - 4 inches around my belly in these few weeks, and together with following a plan provided by Itrackbites app, I lost about 6 lbs. Overall I am very happy with this workout, and I will update my review when I am close to finishing level 2.
I highly recommend you try this if you're on the edge. Also, it's free on YT without the 10 min intro.",1452038400,14,1477,3.9932432432432434

3081358,5,B00127RAJY,"Everything I have to say about this DVD has probably already been said, but I thought I'd throw my two cents in. I am not an avid exerciser. Never have been. I'm tall and due to some fabulous genetics (thanks, Mom and Dad), I've always been on the thin side naturally without having to exert much effort. But I've never been strong, or toned, and I lacked any and all endurance or cardio fitness which is quite dangerous as heart disease runs in my family. I finally decided enough was enough a couple of months ago and buckled down with this workout.

And it worked. Take it from someone who honestly doesn't enjoy working out - the 30 Day Shred IS DOABLE. And it is effective. It hurts, don't get me wrong. As Jillian says on many occasions, results don't come for free. But they do come! I stuck with all three levels for 10 days each, taking a rest day every 5 or 6 days, so it took me a bit over a month but I lost 6-7 inches total (mostly around my waist, hips and arms) and 3-5 lb. As I said, I didn't have a ton of weight to lose anyway and that wasn't my goal. But the best part? Feeling fit, and strong, and having more energy! And being toned overall. I can see muscles without flexing that didn't exist before! Not only that, but my core is stronger which equals less back pain (I have had back problems for years). For less than 30 minutes a day, it's nothing short of miraculous and worth every minute of swearing at the TV.

I'm about to start her Ripped in 30 tomorrow and I can't wait to see what further results it brings. Jillian has certainly made me a believer. Stick with it, eat right (as much as possible) and it will work for you too!",1451865600,10,1659,4.197492163009405

If you like this DVD, please try Ripped in 30 as it is essentially the same style of workouts, but much improved over this DVD. I think Ripped in 30 has better warm-ups and cool-downs (slightly longer), as well as 3 strength moves per circuit vs 2, which makes it go by a lot quicker. I feel like I always get a better workout with Ripped in 30, for the same amount of time. Not that 30 Day Shred is a bad dvd, just that Ripped in 30 is better.",1451347200,23,621,3.976

3081394,5,B00127RAJY,"This video is great for those trying to get back in shape after not exercising for awhile.  After having my 5th child and not doing much exercising during my pregnancy, I suffered from weak knees and a lot of extra weight. After trying to run, my knees were extremely sore and not able to handle the extra weight. I needed a lower impact way to get the weight off and build up my stamina. This workout is great for that. It's very low impact but gets you sweating and helps build up your stamina and get that muscle tone back. You only do a 30 minute workout on each level so it's fairly easy to make time for it during your day. You can't take any breaks during it though because if you want those 30 minutes to be effective you have to work for it. I've definitely noticed an increase in muscle tone after only two weeks as well as a huge increase in stamina. I've even lost about 4 lbs in these two weeks (combined with a health, low carb diet) Definately recommend this workout video for those trying to get back on the habit of exercising or those with injuries that want a low impact but effective workout.",1450310400,4,1112,4.270142180094787

3081397,5,B00127RAJY,"This woman is crazy. But sometimes you need crazy to help kick your butt in gear. I started this program as a couch potato. I won't lie, it was hard at first, but noting I couldn't handle. I just took it slow in the beginning and listened to my body. If I felt like I couldn't do a move, or needed a minute to breathe, I would march in place and jump back in once I had pulled it back together. After about a week, I was completing every move with ease. DONT GIVE UP. Little progress is better than no progress! It may have taken my an extra week, but regardless, I'm 15 pounds lighter. Worth it!!! You can do it!!",1450137600,8,614,4.040983606557377
3081398,5,B00127RAJY,"Mostly love it.
I have one complaint, and that is that when Jillian has us do jumping jacks, she says that everyone can do jumping jacks and there are no excuses for getting out of them. I don't know, but I'm guessing she hasn't had a baby as that has completely shot mine and my mother's ability to jump and not pee ourselves. I think this is a good reason to not do jumping jacks.
OTHER THAN THAT, I love this and use it a lot. Wasn't trying to get shredded when I bought it, just for casual use--two or three times a week--to mix up my workouts. I'm always sore afterwards and feel proud of what I've been able to accomplish.",1450137600,5,628,4.155737704918033

I thought well it must just be the weather (my joints pop hot or cold 24/7) so I thought nothing of it. But the next night when I went to do the video again, they poped everytime I moved my arm! Taking a break from that section I went on and low and behold my KNEES stated popping as well! I have stopped this DVD and given it to Goodwill. I'll go back to Yoga...",1450137600,,615,3.928

I rotate thru the 3 levels weekly and sometime when I am being lazy will just go back to level 1. Mind you, level 1 is still a great workout.  LOVE the fact it is 20 mins, a full workout for anyone.  I did, however, utilize my heavier weights for some of the chest moves (15 lbs) and bought 5 lbs weights for all the back and shoulder exercise.  For beginners, start with 1 lbs, may not seem like much but it will!  Be sure to wear good athletic shoes, you do lots of jumping jacks and in place aerobics.",1450051200,2,604,4.050420168067227

The workout is good and really works up a sweat but you have to get past her ridiculous leering into the camera, stopping every minute to walk around jabbering constantly then gloriously jumping in at the last set to give herself more camera time. I prefer my instructors to sweat right along with me and give me a few moments to focus rather than having to listen to constant garble. You cannot skip to the workout from the start of the video either. It immediately starts up with her giving a spiel (GO FIGURE) which I try to skip over.

This is the only one that I can keep the volume on. Its a great workout and it's not complicated. The only equipment you need is one set of light hand weights (1-3 pounds) and a mat if you're exercising on a hard surface. Each workout is about 20 minutes. There are 3 different workouts.

3081478,3,B00127RAJY,"It didn't help me really lose weight. It muscled me up a bit tho, but it definitely didn't work for my body type (pear-shaped). Lol it kind of just solidified my body mass and I'm trying to slim down here lol (replaced fat w/ muscle tone). It was A LOT of arm exercises. I needed more toning in my stomach and thighs. It just really fatigued and stressed out my body, it's really not worth it for someone who is trying to lose weight, there are better options out there. I stuck with it but eventually after 28 days and not seeing much results I was over it. I'm pretty healthy outside of this workout so maybe this wasn't going to show much results in me? but still I feel this isn't the best option; I definitely didn't  feel motivated to work out and she started to annoy me. I should have known from her body type though; it might work for someone with a straight up and down body but regardless of that, I don't think this is a great idea for people who want to get in shape fast; not the most effective cardio/muscle strengthening. It didn't burn as much as stretch me in awkward positions that eventually strained my knee cap and arm socket. I'm sure if you had the correct form lol yeah it might help but they weren't very easy to follow sometimes so if you're body is unlike any form represented there, then you might actually strain yourself.

I've been doing this DVD on and off for about a year, and in the past 2 months have really stepped up my game and been doing it diligently Monday - Friday.  I have noticed results - specifically, my stamina has greatly improved, my arms and thighs have toned up, and my abs/core have definitely gotten stronger. I used to get winded running to my mailbox, which is maybe a city block away.  Now I can run 3/4 of a mile before stopping.  That's incredible for a girl who managed to skirt through high school without ever actually running a lap in gym.

So I'm sure you probably already know this from other reviews or the product info itself, but there are three workouts in here, Levels 1-3.  You're supposed to do each level for 10 days, combining it with her meal plan for maximum weight loss (unfortunately her meal plan didn't involve eating an entire Costco pizza by yourself so I kindly had to pass on that section).

She says they're 20 minutes, but they're actually 30 minutes once you factor in the warm up and cool down (I mean, you're not supposed to skip those so they should count, right?).  The first week will be the worst - you will wish you were dead (if you're like me, you might also wish Jillian were dead).  You will be sore for a few days afterwards. The first week of Level 1 feels like what I think getting beat up by Batman would feel like.  I actually shed a few tears the first night because I hurt so bad (true story).  But if you keep it up you'll notice that slowly, jumping jacks are a little less awful.  And the push ups never get easy, but they get easier.

I would recommend

- Definitely checking in with your doctor before you start. I sprained my chest last December and had to take a break for several months (look it up, chest muscle injuries are one of the slowest to heal!).  So I really strongly recommend a sports bra if you're going to do all the jumping jacks, jump rope, rock star jumps and butt kicks she wants you to do.  I would also check in with a doctor if you have questions about your knees, because she will basically destroy them if you're not careful.

- Bringing your own music once you get the routines down, as it really makes them go by faster.  And it helps if you have a partner to hold you accountable.

The important thing is to just develop the habit of doing it - whether you do it in the morning like me or after everyone has gone to bed.  Whatever time works best for you, just keep at it.  It takes 30 days or so to build a habit and only missing it once or twice to break it!  This is a great habit to develop, don't give up on yourself.

So the real question that everyone's probably wondering: am I ripped?  No.  You might call me ""roughly in the shape of a healthy person"", but definitely not ripped.  I'm not in any danger of having six pack abs or buns of steel (though I think you could probably get ripped with this, if you were unlike me and willing to give up ice cream). Am I healthier?  Definitely - along with the aforementioned benefits above, I just feel healthier.  I (believe it or not!) seek out healthier foods, I take the stairs instead of the escalator. It's tough to explain, but I think Jillian says it best: when you're disciplined and work out, then you'll be disciplined in other areas of your life as well.

Let me be clear here: I do not actually like the workout itself, but I AM enjoying the impact it's having on my life and health.",1445904000,12,3639,4.194244604316546
3081600,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian will kick your but.  I had this DVD before but lost it in a move and I knew I had to replace it.  It works great.  You will lose weight if you keep up with it.  When first starting this I will take 2-3 weeks before moving up to the next phase, it takes me longer than the 30 days but sometimes my body just isn't ready for the next phase and it's great that I can help set my own pace.

I love that it is only 30 minutes.  Usually Jillian's DVDs are longer than that and it makes it hard to fit in during a busy work week.  But I know I can spare a half an hour a day for my health.  Her 3:2:1 system is great so you know what to expect.  3 minutes of cardio.  2 minutes of strength.  And 1 minute of ab work.  It's not easy your muscles will feel it the next day and you might not thing that you can do it again but you can and you will get through it.  Stick with it (I cheat and sometimes take a day or 2 off during the week) and you will notice results.  You will drop pounds, loose inches and the work out will start to get easier.  Level up when you think you are ready and if you try and aren't give it another week and try again.

Jillian is a good motivator without being annoying, she doesn't have that super cheery fitness instructor personality that annoys me to no end.  She has good cuing and will help keep you on pace and on track.

This is one of my favorites.  I know I can do it (and I'm not in great shape), I know that it will work if I stick with it.",1445904000,,1480,3.7934426229508196

For beginners, I am certain level 1 would be intense, fun, and deliver great results on its own with a reasonable diet plan. I do levels 1 and 2 back to back and that combination is amazing!! I love the circuits as my mind tends to wander. The fast pace keeps me focused. I've only had these a week, but have done this particular routine twice now in combination with P90X and running. Excellent workout!! I highly recommend it, but again; if you're in decent physical condition to start with, more is better.

Jillian goes through 3 work-outs --designed to grow with you. The first is the easiest and slowly gets harder as you go along. I stayed on the first level for about 30 days before moving on, but that's because I was starting from scratch. I saw results within two months---I felt better, my endurance was through the roof and I went down a few sizes! I've had this for over 4 years now and it's my go to workout. I would definitely recxomend this to someone just starting work outs or someone looking for w workout change. It's worth the money and your time!!",1444867200,6,704,4.3007518796992485

Workout is a butt-kicking 20 minutes that will shred you nicely. Obviously if it's a recorded workout there will be repetition. But if you go to an exercise class at a gym do you think the instructor doesn't repeat himself there too? Working out at home requires dedication and discipline and you don't have the camaraderie of a gym scene.

That said, these JM DVDs are the real deal. When I was 24 I lost 60 lbs using this and being careful about portion control. I quit working out for a while after that because I had reached my goal but when I met my husband I gained some of the weight back and this helped me lost 16lbs in a month in a half before my wedding. You just have to do it, I find I get the results I want quickly if I do it 6 days a week.

Since using this video, much of my back and shoulder pain has been eliminated, my posture is getting far better than is has been in years and I am starting to feel solid.  The 3 different workouts are fantastic and work the entire body.  I have done all levels and they can get progressively harder, but not so much that you can't do it with modifications.  To make the lower levels harder, use heavier weights.  This video has kept me motivated and how can anyone not find just 20 minutes to do this video?  Even on the days that I can't get myself to run, I do this video.  Jillian Michaels has some great exercise videos.  I love the fact the the 2 ladies who are in the video have different figures than Jillian so you can see other shaped ladies who are fit.

Initially I could only keep up with about 4 days a week (taking every other day off), but by week 2 it seems I am no longer needing the rest days.  I was already in pretty great shape, but these workouts are definitely taking my fitness/strength/endurance up several notches.  I can see more definition throughout my body in just one week.  Excellent.  I also feel great and have tons of energy.  Thanks Jillian (and team)!  PS:  Get ready to sweat!!

It's short and a good workout.  I got brave and tried level 3 the other day and I did find it easier in the cardio department than level 2.  But I did enjoy all three levels.  She does a good job at mixing things up and encouraging you to keep going.

What I love about this dvd is that it has different levels. You have your beginner, intermediate, and advanced. If you feel like gotten use to one level move on to the next. Also, I love that Jillian understands not everyone that starts working out is on the same level. She has two women on the workout for you to follow. One that does the workout on a beginner level and the other that does it on an advanced level. Also don't get fooled because there are woman on this workout. This workout can be just as challenging for men. I've gained weight again and this time I'm starting at 210. I lost my DVD so I had to buy again to replace it because this is the only DVD that I know can guarantee results as long as you but the effort into it.

I started thirty day shred 14 days ago. I lost a 4.8lbs so far. The first week I focused on eating under 1200 calories but the second week I cut out carbs entirely. I also kept with level one. I tried level two but felt I wasn't strong enough. I'm also heavy chested and don't want to bulk up my upper body so Instead of doing a lot of the upper body exercises I do squats with the weights and for abs I only do the bicycles crunches.

3081949,5,B00127RAJY,"This is my first time buying a Jillian Michael's DVD. I have currently completed 20 days of the 30 day shred and still going. I complete a level 4-5 days of the week. Let me start by saying that my original goal was to lose 25 pounds, be healthier, and get more in shape. In the last 20 days, I have only lost 5 lbs. A lot of people, like me, will look at that number and think that's nothing this DVD must not work. However, I also have been measuring my inches as I have gone along and have lost almost 10 inches overall. I have gone down an entire clothing size (pants and shirts) and feel much stronger. Even when I walk I can feel that my legs are much stronger than before. I have to say that this DVD has changed my mindset. I am going to start looking at the inches that I lose instead of the pounds.

It has always been difficult for me to lose and maintain lost weight. Therefore, if I change my mindset to becoming stronger and healthier, then I think it will be easier for me. In addition to doing the DVD as my workout I am also doing a blood type diet. There are a lot of people that say this diet is not good and it doesn't work. However, ever since starting it I have felt much better, more energy, less hungry so often, and my digestive health has improved.

So also realize that I am VERY out of shape. I started Level 1 of the DVD and thought OMG I am never going to make it through this. I was doing the modified moves and about died. I pushed forward and continued to do Level 1 for the next week. Then I moved on to Level 2 feeling the same way of how I originally felt of Level 1. I thought there is no way it can be much more difficult. Then I completed Level 2, my face blood red, dripping sweat, and my little girl asking me ""Are you ok? Are you going to die?"" And I thought, yes I am about to die. I continued back and forth between Level 1 & 2. The reason for doing this was to give me a break and a different workout so that I would not get bored. Then one day I tried Level 3. I am still working on mastering Level 3. I continue to do most of the modified moves and am always pouring sweat and sore when I am done. Again, I will still rotate all three levels when I am very sore or just tired of the same workout. I am still benefiting from Level 1 although I now feel it is much easier (hence I am getting stronger).

One warning that I will say is that my knees are always sore after every workout and I have no knee problems. I don't know if my muscles are sore or if I am hurting my knees. There are a lot of squats and lunges. I am completing these correctly so it is not an error in my move. Therefore if you have any knee issues then I would not recommend this DVD. I am finally able to start including some cardio into my workouts besides the DVD and hope to see even greater results soon. If anything, this DVD has made me much stronger and have a higher self-esteem because of how great it makes me feel.",1439251200,8,2944,3.9695945945945947
3081950,2,B00127RAJY,"okay, I'm kind of bummed!!

The workout intensity is hard but when I was finished I felt like I did nothing to be proud of or even feel like i worked hard I also wear a calorie counter and I only burned 112 calories during level 1 Autumn Calabrese I burn 315 . Maybe I need to move up to level two but I've just started my weight loss journey I'm not in the best shape though I'm trying but I am still over weight.

Generally, speaking I'm fundamentally lazy and having lived a sedentary lifestyle most of my life, at the time I picked this DVD up I found it extremely difficult to exercise, I have never tried a circuit training before at least not at home and I remember being extremely sore for 2 days after doing Level 1 Only! But I pushed myself to complete the first 10 days and It has really changed my outlook on fitness all together. Yes, It helped me lose weight a considerate amount of course while monitoring my diet as well, but most importantly I'm grateful for the fact that I became a healthier person because of this One DVD.

For those of you just starting your health and fitness journey, please give it a try. I usually find exercise routines a tad boring and hard to follow through, but In My opinion 30 day shred was Enjoyable for the most part and is relatively easy that even a person who's over 200 Ibs can manage to follow at least modified version of the exercises so I would surely recommend it for a start.",1438041600,2,1108,4.431372549019608

3082007,5,B00127RAJY,"This is  a great workout series. It is divided into 3 workouts for 25 minutes each. I like that you can buy each workout separately, and they are only 1.99 each. Which is a great value for what you are buying.

I have level 1 and level 3. I liked both, and I though level 3 was only a little harder bit than level 1. I have done Jillian's six week six pack, and I thought that level 3 was easier than that.

The moves are pretty repetitive, but you get a good workout of your arms, thighs, and core. If you combine this with cardio, and strength training you can really see a difference in tone and definition.",1437696000,2,610,4.109243697478991
3082008,4,B00127RAJY,I got this disc just a few days ago. I have loved it every since then. It's a great way to loose weight along with good eating or portion control of your food. It keeps your heart weight up and you even start to break out in a sweat. There are 2 people along with Jillian micheals in this video . They all did the same thing but the girl on the right shows a more easier effective way to do the workouts and I have to say I am pretty please with this disc.,1437696000,,456,3.8105263157894735

3082028,4,B00127RAJY,"These workouts definitely kick your butt. My sister and I have been doing level one every other day for about a month. We haven't tried level 2 or 3 yet but I know those will work. You definitely have to push yourself. After a few straight days of doing level one, it was easier for me. Not super easy, but just enough for it to not suck as much. The only downside with the workouts is that if you have bad knees, this DVD may not be the best for you. Or, you can always switch it up so it's not so hard on the knees. It's just a lot of getting down on the floor and then getting up. (I haven't done level 2 or 3, but I watched them and those have a lot that has to do with the knees). As for the downside with the DVD, it's annoying that every time you want to do a workout, you have to listen to the beginning speech from Jillian before being able to get to the title menu. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a tough workout in a short amount of time.",1437436800,4,962,3.8883248730964466

3082048,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm all about making the most of your time, especially with a baby in the house.  I'm an active person, who typically worked out 4-6 times a week pre baby.  With a little one now, it takes a lot to muster up the energy and desire to go get in a good sweat at the gym....especially when there's a cute little baby at home whom I'd rather spend time with.

This DVD gets my vote for squeezing in a quick sweat session during nap time.  There are three 20 minute workouts, each level increasing in difficulty, but each level provides a quality exercise in a short amount of time.  With a 20 minute workout sitting in front of me, I find no excuse to not pop it in every couple of days.  This DVD has a great blend of strength, cardio and abs in a quick manner and even allows time to squeeze in a shower post workout!

I highly recommend this DVD for ANYONE looking to get in a quick sweat session at home.  Whether a beginner, experienced, new mommy, or someone looking for a quick alternative to the gym, this is it.  The price is great and definitely a worthwhile purchase.",1437004800,5,1073,4.246305418719212

I dropped 12 pounds on it and results were apparent, as I had lost a lot of my love handles and my tummy was more defined. I am 5'10 and was 165 pounds before I started. I will say, don't be discouraged if you do try this and you don't lose a ton of weight. If you finish it out, it'll appear like you've lost more than you actually have because of the muscle you gain from the program. Pay more attention to your appearance than the scale. Would not recommend if you're looking for a drastic change, but It's a good choice if you need a place to start.",1436659200,5,651,3.9770992366412212

I didn't feel like Level One was doing much so after two weeks I jumped to Level Two....and man Jillian works you hard! Level Two is challenging for me because I have to bad shoulders and there is mostly shoulder work from plants to military lifts. A lot of upper body. But again, you go at your own pace.
My one big complaint is the Promo at the beginning of the tape. It is LONG and you can't fast forward. Every time you workout you have to wait for the lengthy promo to end. I guess that's what you get when you pay for a DVD under $10. I just start the tape and get water, roll my mat out, gather my weights while the promo plays.

I did Jillians 30 day shred with it once a day for 30 days.. 10 on level 1 10 days on level 2 and 10 days level 3. I love that it is only 20 mins so its easy to fit in ANY schedule. In the 2nd month I lost an additional pounds and reached my goal weight. I have maintained it now for over a year! I also helped my mom to lose 134 pounds in a year and she has kept the weight off!

3082088,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD long ago and the first time I attempted it was super super hard. It was the first time I attempted any exercise program in many years. I was obviously sore the first week. This DVD is composed of three levels and my goal was to move into each level after 10 days. You can move to level 2 or 3 as you feel comfortable. Even when I finished level 3, I kept going and sometimes I would do the workouts twice a day. I did not follow a diet plan but I did not eat pizza, burgers, or any other junk food. I ate more fruits and restricted my fluid intake to plain water. After 2 months, I lost about 17 lbs. It was a great difference because I am a short person and extra pounds don't look good. I noticed a great difference in legs and my arms. I did not get the super abs but after having two children, I am more than comfortable looking a lot better than before. I think that Jillian Michaels' technique of the 3-2-1: 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of ab work has been the best technique so far. I also bought Ripped in 30 and it has the 3-2-1 technique but this has four levels instead of 3. I borrowed the P90X but I became bored since this is almost an hour workout. I attempted T25 but didn't feel very comfortable because my legs never got a rest and I felt like the rest of my body was not doing much. I love Jillian Michaels and I am looking forward in buying her new workout Bodyshred!!!",1436140800,2,1435,4.056338028169014
3082089,4,B00127RAJY,I have wasted about 30 minutes attempting to find an email or contact with amazon to complain about the quality and inability to play this video. Nad enough that the original contained all three levels and amazon has you pay for each one separately but every time I have tried to play the workout I get adobe update messages. I would rather not have to use this format to complain about this because it is an amazon issue not a work out issue. I have used this dvd in the past to get in shape. It is truly fabulous if you stick with it!! Don't give up however I would recommend buying a hard copy and not waste time adding it to your library for convenience like I did. So far it has been anything but a convenience and if anyone knows how I can actually find a useful place to complain to amazon please let me know because it is frustrating to try to play something you paid for and not be able to use it. Amazon get your act together and fix the way this video plays or in my case doesn't play at all. PS all my other amazon videos play fine and don't constantly prompt me for updated adobe which my computer is in compliance with. Ugh!!,1436054400,2,1139,4.158371040723982

I usually follow it up with my own set of strength/weight training but I love using this as a precursor so I can get my cardio in- my heart blasts the entire workout and I love it. I enjoy Jillian as an instructor and I don't mind that she stops exercising to explain the form. She does that in a few others I have of hers too but I don't mind it.

3082134,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great overall workout video. I bought 2, one for home, and one for office use. I've followed it for a month, and finished level 2. Now I rotated between level 1 and 2 depending on my condition and other workout programs. When I first tried level one, I could not complete any single one movement in length and had to take break in the middle. Now the only movements I still have issue with are push-up (in level one) and double jumps in level two. Even so, I still panted and sweated heavily even doing level one. It is an amazing workout DVD, it builds up my strength and endurance but still keeps me challenged.
The only weak point to me is the abs. I don't feel I get my abs worked out enough. Compared with strength and cardio, abs part seems like a welcoming cool-down. I see my upper body and lower body get toned (esp upper arms, chest, backs, shoulders and thighs), but my middle section does not get much improvement. I tried the 'Six Pack in Six weeks', and even that is a good overall workout, it still does not touch my core sufficiently. So I returned to some of the old fashioned crunch-based abs workout DVD. I'll need to wait and see, but I feel sore around abs after these workouts, which I seldom felt with Jillian's workout.",1434585600,2,1253,4.336170212765958

What usually takes hours in the gym to accomplish, Jillian Michaels has achieved in 20-30 minutes. It has different workout levels that you can graduate to as you go along. However, you can meet your weight loss goals if you never advance past Level 1. It will cause you to sweat, and work hard, but it will get easier as you go. And once you see the results, you will be hooked. If you like workouts that are short, effective, and yield quick results, this is the workout for you.

Jillian Michaels will make you sweat, cuss and maybe even cry but she delivers RESULTS!

DVD came on time and in perfect condition.

Lost 5 lbs and 14"" overall the first 30 days. Thank you Jillian Michaels!",1433980800,3,224,4.6923076923076925
3082171,5,B00127RAJY,"I've been going back to this video for yrs. The first time I tried it about 3 yrs ago I was completely out of shape, the resulting soreness was uncomfortable at first (normal) but I stuck to it & got toned so quickly like I've never have before in my life-not even at the gym. If you do it at least 4-5 times a week you will see results in less than a month. This is not an easy workout, but it is so convenient due to the fact that you can do it from home, you need minimal equipment (mat for hard floors & weights-I use 5 lbs.) and the workout itself is short and goes by quickly.

I always start with this after long periods of not working out. After 2 yrs of not working out & unwanted weight gain,  I popped in my Jillian DVD & after only 2 weeks I see my abs again. I feel so much stronger and also have more endurance. I move on to the next level after 2 weeks which is when my muscles start to feel conditioned.

I highly recommend this dvd. I've gifted it as well. It's tough but anyone can do it if they stick to it and you'll feel really amazing when you see the quick results. You may feel as if you can't get through it at first which is normal but you can if you push.

I highly recommend Jillian Michael's  ""No More Trouble Zones"" after completing ""30 Day Shred "". The workout is longer but it'll make you even stronger.",1433808000,8,1335,4.003759398496241
3082172,5,B00127RAJY,"I love this workout. Level 1 is great, level 2 is waaaayyyyyy too hard...there is a lot of up and downs...so if you have knee issues, stick with level 1...there seems to be a big leap from level 1 to 2. I always feel sore, and my body actually feels like it is changing. Also you can do level 1 as a warm up and then go running after if you really want a great work out.

I also start off with this dvd if I haven't worked out in a while. It gets me back in the groove of things.

I now have the whole dvd memorized so I turn down the volume and turn up my music. haha. It's the best. Thanks Jillian!

I've read some of the other reviews where people mentioned that this workout isn't good because it is rough on the knees. If you have bad knees, like myself, you can modify these moves or switch them out for a movement with less impact on the knees. Really, it's about following her system of cardio, strength and abs. Another bonus -  you only have to suffer 20 minutes. I'm on level two and have only been at it a few weeks and have noticed my muscles toning up and I'm losing some of my baby fat after four kids. Well worth it.",1432944000,18,685,4.229007633587786

But i will advice ppl to just do it 3-4 times per week if you are a  beginner and if you are athletic 5 times a week is enough the body needs rest.,1432944000,4,411,3.7241379310344827

3082225,5,B00127RAJY,"I purchased this video because it seemed short enough for me to do everyday (20 mins of actual workout). She's one tough trainer, she often says things that aren't nice in this video but it's to motivate and push you to work through and make the most of the 20 mins she has you working out. I have done the 30 days but not 7 days a week since I do  long run and rest for one day on weekend. However I have seen the difference in my clothes and my stamina doing the workouts. I still can't do the unmodified versions of all three levels but I am in better shape than I was before I started and it takes minimal time for my day. I also went from not working out at all to being able to keep up with most of the excercises. I think the key is that it's short but it's a lot of work so most people should be able to do this video with no problems.",1432684800,,843,3.8728323699421967

3082231,4,B00127RAJY,"I bought Jillian Micheals 30 day shred about 2 years ago. Tried it a few times, it was really hard and I didn't stick to it more than a day or two. I am 5'7"" and weigh 167lbs. This is the most I've ever weighed and decided I really needed to do something about it; becuase I have never been so uncomfortable with my body. Over the past 8ish months I've gained 20lbs. Id love to be back down into the 140 range but am trying not to get my hopes too high and would be happy with losing 10lbs.
I am currently on day 4 of the 30 day shred still on level 1. And as hard as this DVD is I love it. After the first day of working out my calves and arms were killing me, but it's a good kind of pain! The only reason I didn't give this DVD a 5 star rating is because I'm just not sure yet if I am going to loose any weight. This time however, I am going to put in my all to stick to it. so for so good. I have changed my diet a little and am doing this workout everyday hoping to see results!

3082246,5,B00127RAJY,"How can I love this DVD? It's PAINFUL, it's not easy by any means and yet I love it. I've waited 2 months to write this review because I really wanted to give it a fair shot before I jumped in with my thoughts. I tend to go gung-ho at first, dive right in and then quit too quickly because I pushed myself too hard. This time I was really careful and methodical with how I went about this DVD. I'm 42, have a son and felt determined to finally begin my goal of exercising regularly. I'm 5ft 5. I started at 162 Ibs. My size 10's were getting too tight and I refused to go up to a 12!

Level 1 starts off with an easy enough warm up and ends with basic stretching.
It includes 3 circuits, each circuit consisting of:
1) 3 minutes of strength (pushups, lunges, side lunges, chest flies, etc.)
2) 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope [without the rope], punches)
3) 1 minute abs (basic crunch, reverse crunch, side crunches, bicycle)

I use 5Ib weights throughout except I use 3Ib for the boxing/cardio and shoulder raise/side lunge (which happens to be my favorite of all of the exercises)

After 2 months I've lost 7 Ibs and instead of squeezing into a tight size 10 I'm now in a size 6 in some clothes, but mostly a size 8. I'm VERY happy with this. I didn't measure myself because I honestly didn't think I'd keep it up truth be told, but I've definitely lost inches. More than how I look though is how great I feel. I have more energy. My stamina is amazing, and I just love this DVD! I love how I feel when I'm done.

One other thing about me - I have MS. I have a mild case of it - knock wood - but because of weakness in my legs I've had to modify how often I do this workout. I tried it daily for 6 days straight but I couldn't maintain that pace as my symptoms returned. My dr. said I was pushing my body too hard so I now I do it every other day and cardio on the other days. I also follow a low calorie diet and Jillian Michael's 80/20 philosophy. I believe all of this has helped me go down 2 sizes. I don't want to be a size 2. I'll never be a skinny lithe person. But getting to a six and feeling so much healthier is something I'm really proud of. Here's what has helped me:

1) It's only 22 minutes, and as hard as it is it goes by very fast. This has helped me realize and appreciate I can find 20 minutes in my day to this. There's no excuse. My son does his homework, and I work out. I get up early some days to do it. I do it on weekends. There's NO excuse not to do it with it being so short.

2) Take your time and don't push yourself too hard. The day after I first did it I could hardly move. It hurt to sit down to pee for crying out loud! I took 2 days off and went back at it. Start slow and ease into it. This is a tough workout .... don't burn out so fast by rushing in.

3) Practice the form of each movement and then get into it. My knees killed me the first 2 weeks and a lot of reviews mention knee pain because of this workout. It's not this DVD that's the problem - it's the way you're doing it! Practice, do it with someone watching you and get your form right. And then when you're exercising watch your form to make sure you're not injuring yourself. After I did this my knee pain went away and I'm all good.

4) Go at your pace. In the beginning I would try and keep up with Jillian and it was completely stressing me out. Go at your pace. You'll find after a week or two your stamina will have improved and you can push yourself harder.

5) Adjust the routine if you feel you need to. I realized I will never be able to do a pushup on my toes. I just can't do it. So now I do the plank the whole time she does the pushups. It's HARD! But I can do that better than a pushup.

6) I am still on level 1 after 2 months. Probably because I do it every other day. I don't feel stressed about that. I'm not ready to move on yet. I've seen (amazing) results with level 1 and I'm ok with that. Having MS doesn't stop me from doing this but it does make me tweak it in a way that is beneficial for me.

7) Believe it or not when I miss my workout days - life gets busy as a mom and birthday parties, and school meeting and my job can take over but I always get back to it. The longest break I've taken is 5 days and every single day I tried to get to it but something pulled me away. I never fully quit though and would get right back to it. It also taught me that it's harder when you've not done it for a while!!!! That in itself makes me want to keep going and never miss a day. I now do it more first thing in the AM even though that kills me as I'm not a morning person.

8) I HATE the warm up and the first 10 minutes. I literally loathe it. That's the hardest for me for some reason. But once it gets going and I'm 10 minutes in, I LOVE it. I have certain points in the dvd where she says things that just make me smile. When she talks about wanting to quit and turn the dvd off, I'm always going harder, pushing myself further. When she says don't phone it in , go lower and deeper with your legs, I do. I love her and feel she is funny, and real and she makes me want to be better.

9) If you can do more, do it. In level 1 during the boxing/cardio I use 3Ib pound weights. I don't have to but I can, so I push it harder.

10) Watch your diet. I've seen the best changes when I really commit to the 80/20 philosophy. No point kicking your but in this workout only to spoil it with poor food choices.

Give this DVD a try. Commit to it. REALLY COMMIT to it and you'll see results.",1432166400,81,5537,3.896276595744681

3082285,5,B00127RAJY,"I am new to exercise dvds but this one had great reviews and the price was right. I am so glad I did! I'm on day 16 and even though I hadn't been recording stats I can already notice changes. My posture is better and my butt is tighter.

The most amazing result is my blood pressure.  I am 33yo and my BP wasn't considered high but it had been consistently at the higher end of normal for the last couple of years, enough to cause concern. At days 5 & 6 I had my BP taken, just normal doc visits, and my both times my BP was just below 120/80 (in a good way) & I was complimented on my healthy BP. I was floored!!! Considering it was also finals week & the fact that my BP normally increases anyways due to anxiety about the reading it is even more amazing.

The exercises are tough but doable. Even at the modified version I'm still getting my butt kicked. Be aware that level 2 has a lot of plank poses, which some may find difficult.  It's alot of up and down etc...

Overall for a program that costs $8 & only lasts 20 min it is fantastic. I am hooked to j michaels & just ordered her Ripped in 30. Can't wait to start!",1431129600,4,1123,3.9955357142857144

I felt like a failure after the first time I did this video. I was so tired. But DO NOT GIVE UP!!! YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!! DO WHAT YOU CAN IN THE VIDEO EVENTUALLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP UP.
At first I thought to myself, what the heck?! If I wanted to do push ups I'd do push ups.
TAKE your TIME. In the beginning I could only do 2 push-ups...and laid there as they kept going....eventually, a few times after doing it I could keep up.
I really felt like I hit a big goal after completing the level 1 with ease. It really boosted my confidence.
It will not be a 30 day shred for me, it will be more like a 60 day.
I've incorporated running for 2 minutes and walking for 2 minutes on the treadmill 5 days a week for 25 minutes so I only do Jillian videos on the weekends. THAT DOES WONDERS TRUST ME. I look forward to purchasing more.",1430697600,2,926,3.9047619047619047

I was never having extra weight, but that workout made me lose cms at the right places. I lost 4 cm on thights & hips, and 3 at the waist. I do exercise 3-4 times a week, so it is an impressive result. People at work started to comment my weight lose, even if i just lost 2 kgs. I am short and athletic so those 2 kgs gave a fantastic effect on the whole body shape. Those exercises are pretty simple, effective and work the whole body. I didn't do that workout every day but it still works. For those, who doesn't like Jillian, she can be pretty annoying at the video, but the video gives results. If you are having problems with knees and back, you should be careful doing squats and jumps.

Julian is very motivating and I like having the two girls giving modifications and hard workouts at the same time so I can follow the one at my level. The only thing I do not like about this DVD is you cannot skip through much of the beginning portions of the video so it takes time to get back to the actual workout daily. Very frustrating...

3082384,5,B00127RAJY,"Everyone always seems to talk and have such great reviews with this DVD so I gave it a shot! At first, I really wasn't a fan of Jillian but now I have most of her DVDs so I think I've become a fan. Her workouts always make me sweat and feeling overall accomplished.

For this one, you have three levels, starting with level one and you progress forward when you're sure you can step up to the next level. It only takes a month to do so you really have to focus.  Don't be afraid to step it up if feel you may not be ready for the next level. You have to get used to that *next level* work to put in and then, it'll become easy to you! When I thought I had the first day in the bag, WRONG! It was super hard for me! Since I'm used to doing some of these moves over and over again, it seems it'll be easy easy. However, you learn and do the exercises over and over each day. You begin to build strength to sustain for longer periods plus my endurance has gotten better too. I've noticed in other workouts outside of this DVD, I've become quicker. Also I've managed to make it without so many pauses too. I got through level two and three by the end of the 30 days and still to this day, all three levels are a challenge I'm always up for! Jillian really kicks you to push yourself along with Anita and Natalie throughout every session which is great motivation!

I didn't lose AS much weight with this because those last extra lbs want to be stubborn. However, I lost a couple of inches off my waist, thighs and have gained strength all around so I'm glad to be leaner and feeling the burn afterwards! It's an excellent DVD for those who want to see what they're capable of.

The amount of stretching is very short, and you only hold the post for 10 sec. My only frustration is the 5 minutes of introduction on the DVD that you cannot fast forward through before you get the option to select what workout you want to do. I find myself having to start it, walk away and do something else while I wait for all the credits/intro to finish. Overall, good video...

You can make them harder by using heavier weights.  20 minutes isn't a lot of time to work out.  I think using this can result in weight loss if you are really dieting.  I do know it can improve you overall level of fitness.  I do like that most moves aren't risky, just designed to work your muscles.  Overall it is a good, quick workout.  I don't thin anyone will blast off a ton of weight if they aren't dieting and moving more throughout the day.  I started ramping up my workouts with this and have now progressed the Cathe's workouts that can be 40 minutes to an hour plus.

I have done that and keep on increasing as I start working out again.  It may be something that is a bit difficult but worthwhile.  Even doing a few minutes has helped as I have gone along with the combination of things she targets.

3082444,5,B00127RAJY,"Let me first start off by telling a little bit about myself. I am 25 years old and overweight. In high school I played tennis and did marching band, so I was decently active. Back then, I was not super skinny, in fact, I have never been super skinny, but I wasn't fat like I am now (maybe a little harsh? it's the truth...). Once I went to college, I was doing no form of exercise except walking to and from class and taking the stairs occasionally. I probably did gain the freshman 15 because of the delicious cafeteria food. Still tho, I wasn't as self conscious as I am today. What really got me was when I graduated college and got an internship at a hotel and served every morning. I ate everything in sight, but I was also hustling my ass off with waiting on tables and working weddings. You don't sit while serving, I should have been losing weight, but wasn't because of the over eating. So, that's how I got to where I am now: very overweight.

I decided that since I would like to become a mother within the next few years, I would like to lose weight before I get pregnant. After reading the reviews, I decided to get this. Can't beat 20 minutes when you're lazy like me!

Day one: HARD. I had to stop a few times, even with Jillian telling me not to, but it's hard. I could barely do the push-ups (which was discouraging because being in marching band, we did push ups all the time). I got through it tho, and felt great afterwords.

Day two: Hard, but seemed easier. I was so sore tho. I could hardly walk down one step. I was walking around work looking ridiculous. I was just so sore.

Took one day of rest because that was my plan, but also because I slipped on some ice on day two and fell right on my knee.

Day three: I could definitely see a difference from day one, I WAS getting stronger and I could make it through the last set of cardio where you do everything without stopping!

Blah blah blah, it got easier and I am getting stronger. I have been slacking on the jumping jacks because I hate them more than anything, but I can see a difference every day, even when I skip days. Usually work out on Monday, Tuesday, skip Wednesday, start again on Thursday, work out Friday, and Saturday if I'm feeling it. Rest again on Sunday. However, my knees are killing me, not sure if it's the squats or the lunges, but they hurt. Also, some days I get shin splints, but they go away within a few hours. I guess that's to be expected because those are common with an increase in activity level. I have not moved on from level one because I still can't do it all the way through, but when I feel like I'm ready, I will move on. For the price, you really can't beat it.",1428019200,8,2681,4.206225680933852

3082460,5,B00127RAJY,"I was totally out of shape when I started this workout DVD, so I really appreciated that Jillian has two women doing the workout - one who uses some accommodations to make it easier, one doing it 100% to give something to aim for.  I also have a bum knee - a result of a sports injury back in my early teens, although I kept playing sports for a few more decades.  For the first month, I used a knee brace to help with the stability.  Now I have built up the muscles around my knee enough that I don't need the brace.

I haven't lost the degree of weight that they talk about, but I still give it 5 stars.  My body shape is changing, and I'm a lot healthier.  Three months ago, I had huge, flabby upper arms.  Now they aren't an embarrassment, and I can feel the muscles growing and getting definition while the fat is lessening.  My stomach area is tighter and my pants fit better.  Even when I was young, I did ""girl"" push-ups, on my knees instead on the balls of my feet - now I can do real push-ups.  I can jog again, although not for as long as I'd like (but I know I'll get better, now!)  So, even though the weight is not disappearing at the rate I'd like, I'm really happy with the results so far.  I just feel so much better!  Oh - I'm doing the video 4 days a week.

I love that the workouts are 20 minutes.  I mean, who can't find a mere 20 minutes in their day?  I'm getting another of her DVDs with a longer, harder workout now, but it's good to know that on days when there's a ton of stuff going on, I can just do a 20 minute workout.  I like the 3-2-1 structure of the workout, too.  (3 minutes of strength, 2 of cardio, 1 of abs)  Most importantly, I love her teaching approach and personality.  With Anita demonstrating the easier version of an exercise, and Natalie demonstrating the no short-cuts version, it's easy to to build up to doing the harder exercises.  Jillian makes sure to point out the proper technique, and she seems to say the right motivational statement at the right time for me.",1427760000,11,2016,4.1576227390180875

I really wanted to tone up and drop about 10 pounds within two months but I didn't want to spend huge sums of time or money so I decided to try this DVD.  I have been doing this DVD for exactly one month as of today, but I tweaked the plan by alternating between the DVD and running 2-3 miles every other day (I reduced my portions as well but didn't follow any particular diet plan).  In one month of doing this I have lost 6 pounds, 1 inch in my waist, bust and hips, and a full pant-size.  I have a defined waist and visible abs for the first time that I can recall (I have weighed less, but not had such a defined waist).  For me, this did what I hoped it would do. I feel that if I had done this every day as it was intended the results would probably be slightly better, but I knew I would get burned out if I didn't switch things up.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and I always alternated between the three different Levels to make it more interesting.  As for Jillian Michaels, I am not her biggest fan but her DVD was cheap and delivered decent results for me so I can deal with it.

I could never stick to a workout routine at my gym because the classes were too long and I would always dread going. This workout is short enough, yet EFFECTIVE, so I don't allow myself to make excuses to not get it done. One thing to be mindful of is form. Considering the workout is only 20min, you really need to have really good form to get the most out of the workout. I notice that my form was off during the ab portions but as soon as a corrected it I noticed  more intensity and tightening of my my ab muscles during the workout. Doing the same routine everyday can be boring for some people, but I don't mind because the routine is short enough that I don't feel the need to be overly entertained. These workouts have been the best thing to happen to me.

3082527,5,B00127RAJY,"I am 39 with two young kids - one still in preschool. I have very little time to myself and I am tired all the time. My body has not bounced back after the birth of my second child and I can't seem to lose weight no matter what I do. I tried going to the gym 3-4 times a week for 3 months doing mostly cardio and I didn't lose a pound. I am permanently 15 pounds overweight and at 5 ""2 it really shows. It is VERY hard to kickstart another exercise regime under these circumstances. Exercising daily is like torture when you are extremely out of shape like yours truly.

It felt like a 20 min DVD was a realistic start but I wasn't very hopeful it would work. 5 weeks later (and I'm not even doing it daily) I am noticing my jeans are fitting looser. I can see some muscle definition (under the fat) and my endurance has already improved. I am being very careful with my diet, with the occasional (ok frequent) slip. But wow, I am actually finding the exercises easier and feel motivated to get up early to do it. I accepted that sometimes my preschooler would be next to me joining in or that I would feel like a zombie at 6am. It's not pretty or fun but I feel better finally. I am going to try to do it daily or at least 5 days per week. I haven't dared weigh myself. I will let my body improve more first. It's important not to dwell on weight.

I have great affection for Jillian Michaels. I feel like she really cares about helping people like me. Just when I want to stop and lay on the couch she says, ""you can't get results in 20 mins without working for it"" and I keep going. Or she says, ""this is no joke. You gotta work hard for this"". I appreciate her motivation and her recognition that it is hard work. I love her no-nonsense style. The girls are athletic and dress in casual exercise clothes. Yeah the music is cheesy and horrible but it is super expensive for these companies to buy the rights to ""real"" music so they make their own. I have yet to find a workout DVD with good music. I don't really care. It's the exercise that matters.

My only critique is that the ab work could easily be 2 minutes or even 3 minutes instead of just 1. It is certainly not enough to get any results. When I can I supplement with another ab workout I have - or just do more ab exercises without a DVD. I never feel sore in the abs after this DVD. Otherwise though it is a fantastic all round workout.

It kicks my butt every time, even after doing the workouts for a while.  My body has been changing and I am happy with the results.  This is my new ""go to"" DVD.

3082593,3,B00127RAJY,"Honestly, I purchased this from walmart. I had a cesarean almost 1 year ago. I gained 25 lbs during pregnancy.  I had a 9 lb 5 oz baby. I was still only 10 lbs lighter than the day I had him so I decided I no longer had the excuse ""I just had a baby"" it had been almost a year... that excuse sailed months ago. I looked up my bmi and saw I was considered borderline ""obese"". That was it. I had to change.
So January 23... step 1... started drinking only water and lots of it. Height 5'2"" Weight 161.2...
Jan 27th- cut out large quantities of carbs. No more bread, pasta or potatoes. (Prep for atkins) weight 157
Feb 1st- began atkins.
also began couch 2 5 K program. Weight 156

Today... feb 24th... decided I need to add something extra to my workout routine. I've had this dvd since after having my son. Time to put it to use right?!?!
So current weight... 151. Goal... 125. I'll keep you posted thru my journey and if this program helps  I will increase the stars.

1st update. March 9th.... I sprained my ankle then got the stomach flu so have not yet started. Starting today.
Weight 147.
Height 5'2.

Update 2- tendinitis in my knees started bothering me. Took a break. Stopped atkins and gained 10 lbs back. I was down to 144 now back at 154. Haven't been doing the dvd like I should. Starting again today. Hard to stay motivated once u gain weight back... :-( I'm going to try. I've not yet stuck with the dvd for 30 days.",1424736000,4,1429,4.200729927007299

3082624,5,B00127RAJY,"Great exercise DVD. The 20 minute no-nonsense approach is refreshing, and the exercises are challenging but not impossible. I did the 30-day program and was able to drop a couple of sizes and reverse a year-long trend of slow weight gain. For the first week, I was sure Jillian was out to kill me, but as it turns out, I didn't die -- I got stronger, faster and fitter with each day. Though I didn't get ""shredded"", the results are awesome and happened faster than with yoga, pilates, running, walking, cardio/strength at the gym, swimming and HIIT.

Note: it may not be a great program for you if you have problems with your knees and ankles. If you have manageable issues, just spend a few extra minutes doing dynamic stretches on your troublespots before you get into it, and focus on form throughout, even if you have to go a bit slower.",1424476800,5,841,4.532894736842105

3082712,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian really does it this time.  This workout is a must have for anyone's workout dvd library.  There are so many positives to it!  First of all, it's only twenty minutes--the work out really does fly by!!  Second of all, it is very challenging!  I have been doing this DVD for a month now and I still feel like I've had my butt handed to me by the end of it.  Jillian is seriously no-nonsense in this DVD and I love it.  She doesn't pull any punches--she tells it like it is.  I only have a few concerns about this DVD.  First of all, I think it's a little much for Jillian to expect a person to be able to do push ups in level one.  I have lost almost sixty pounds in the past five months and I still cannot master the full push up.  Even the one on the knees is too challenging for me.  The difficulty of the exercises seem kind of inconsistent--I can handle almost all of level one at the advanced level except for those darn push ups!  The plank positions are really what get me--and the modification is still even a struggle.  I liked in her Killer Buns and Thighs DVD that I was able to start at a beginning level and really build up the muscle--right now with that darn plank, I just feel like I keep failing!  But I suppose that's something to work for and strive for!  The other concern I have is one that many have offered--Natalie really does ""phone it in"" several times in the work out.  It's kind of annoying!  Jillian is challenging you not to stop and then you see this girl with this amazing body just quitting a few times.  I try to remind myself that they probably work out that whole day, but it doesn't always help me from getting mad at her!

I started doing this workout when I was 240 pounds (I'm 5'6"" and female).  It was seriously hard, but I managed even with five pound weights!  Now that I've shaved off sixty pounds, I still do the work out and I still find it effective.  I've been doing this DVD with her Killer Buns and Thighs One for a month and I see incredible improvements in my cardio, my waist and my arms.  Jillian is the way to go--and the complaints I have are so small, they almost should even be a concern at all.  Go Jillian, I absolutely love you!!!",1422662400,8,2197,4.186157517899761

When i started i was 151lbs, Wednesday i was 148, and this morning when i got on the scale i was 146....i am so excited and amazed so far. Day one i was taking my inhaler every 5 minutes throughout the workout, and it was very hard. But today i took my inhaler before i started and got through it with no issues. I will add that ive been doing this along with substituting two meals a day with slimfast shakes, and one 500 calorie meal a day, and eating 3 100 calorie snacks a day. Drinking only water other than the shakes. But thats my choice. Basically with a great diet u will most likely see amazing results.",1422576000,7,686,4.165413533834586

3082743,5,B00127RAJY,"I read the other reviews before buying this DVD of Jillian's 30 Day Shred.  I bought it anyway because you can't always go by reviews and I'm glad I did.

First off, I will say, If you have not ever worked out before or had a regular exercise regime of any type, I would suggest you do as I am doing and instead of planning to lose the weight in 1 month and do all 3 levels in 1 month, split it up and plan 1 level a month for 3 months.

Before buying this video, I had been doing minimal exercise so know my body needs conditioned first.  While I do want to lose weight, I realize that I can't just expect my body to be able to jump right in there after it has not had any type of conditioning to exercise, so decided to take it slow.  Instead of doing this every day, I try to do it 3 to 5 times a week and take a day off as needed (if my muscles hurt too much I take a day off or if I simply don't have time, it is ok to take the day off).

I decided to try to complete 1 level to the point that I could start out with the easy, modified way (the girl on the right) until I could build my body up to follow the harder, full range way (the girl on the left).  Once my body is conditioned to do the workout to the maximum on level 1, then and only then will I move to level 2.  I plan this to take me 3 months instead of 1 month to complete and then after that, i can focus on doing each level every day of the week and completing all 3 in 1 months time (month 4).

Losing weight is important, but conditioning is the first thing one has to do and that is important to know your limitations as well.

As for the reviews about this being bad for the knees....if is not bad for your knees if you are listening to Jillian and doing as she says and she makes it very clear what posture you should not have in order to not damage your knees.  I have a very weak knee from an injury, and I am finding that doing this workout at a slower modified pace and stretching level 1 out to 1 month instead of 1 week, and following everything Jillian says about how to position the knees so as not to hurt them, my weak knee is actually being strengthened.

I have been doing this workout for 2 weeks now and I am noticing a huge difference in my endurance and strength as well as my overall physical well-being.  I am also sleeping better, eating healthier, and living happier.  I may not be losing the 20 lbs in 1 month that one would lose if they did this every day and did 1 full level at the hardest directions every week, but that will come in time.

Something people tend to forget is that when you do a video like this, it is ok to modify where needed for yourself until you build up your body endurance and strength to do the workout with Jillian and the girls.  You don't have to be just like them.  Do it at your own pace, modifying where you need to, not modifying where you don't need to and in time, you will be able to keep up with them and go the whole way through with no problem.

We live in a day and age where everyone wants everything right now.  Workouts are not something you want to have that attitude with if you want them to be successful for you.

Great video with lots of workout 'suggestions' and help.  I also got the Ripped in 30 days to do after I complete this video, but I believe doing both will take me probably 9 months to a year to get up to par and be able to keep up with them all.  And for me, while I do need to lose some weight, I will along the way and so it is all ok to take my time.

Thanks, Jillian, for making an affordable workout video that gets me up and moving and started toward a healthier lifestyle.",1422057600,23,3640,3.9224489795918367

So I tried it. I think the workout is really not too bad and boy do I sweat when I do it! But it bugs me to do a workout video where your trainer doesn't do at least half of the work. I guess for me I like to know that your trainer really is ""right there with you"". I also didn't like the fact that some of the moves you do for much longer then for the other side of your body. Overall, this is a good workout though a little rough on legs and knees if the moves are not performed correctly.

For people at the very beginning of their fitness journey, there is a model to follow who is doing modified routines. There is no problem following the modifications, and it's especially nice to see your progress as you can move from the modified version to the regular version.

If you haven't worked out in a while, this work out has a good balance. It is a bit physically challenging, if you are unfit, but not so much so that you cant do it. So it makes you sweat, but not in a way that makes you despair, give up, and quit. Then, after youve done it for a while, if you are a beginner or a re-beginner its probably better to stay at level one for more than a week, you can move up to the other levels that increase the challenge.
The workout is short, so it doesnt take up too much of your time, and it doesnt give you any excuse not to do it. The form is the usual for Jillian, 3 min strength, 2 min cardio, 1 min abs so you work all the essential. She keeps every part of your body engaged, so that you can take out the max effect from your 20min effort.
Jillian, as always, is tough and motivating, she irradiates you with energy from the TVs screen. Shes a BOMB of energy and purpose that will make you love what you do, even when you hate it!!",1419552000,4,1103,3.972972972972973

3082858,5,B00127RAJY,"Like any other workout regime, it requires determination and a good diet for results. Do not expect to see any results if you don't follow the workout or do not eat well.  I have been following this regimen for years, not just for 30 days and I love the 20-minute workouts. Like some reviewers have said, her constant chattering can get pretty annoying but if you're really serious about getting a workout, you would concentrate on the actual exercise and not the instructor's annoying comments.

They are truly challenging, but if you are diligent, your endurance will improve over time. In my opinion, to lose the 20 in 30, you would have to have a high level of endurance to start. When I began this regimen, I could not complete a full workout. My advise is to stay motivated. By the end of the 30 days (and beyond) you will see a drastic difference.",1419120000,4,854,4.538961038961039

What I absolutely HATE is the fact that you must watch several minutes of previews of other videos and then here Jillian give explanations of the work outs before you can get to the root menu. No fast forwarding. No skipping to the root menu. Come on! I'm strapped for time in the morning. Why else would I be doing 20 minute videos. I just find this very annoying. Would not buy again.

It was hard at first, but I built up stamina and eventually tried level 2.  I love level 2!  Again, I did some of the modified moves until I could actually do a walk out push up!  It's fun and very quick. I've seen my stamina increase and my body looks more toned. I'm an average woman with no athletic ability. I think this DVD is great for anyone with no time who really wants to try to work out. It's much better than just cardio and easy to do at home.

This workout DVD has three different levels that increase with difficulty from level 1 to level 2. The workouts were about 25 minutes long from warm up to cool down. Each workout is a combination of strength, cardio, and abs.  And, because workouts are intense and short, they are done before you know it. Also, I really like the fact that Jillian has two models that work out with her and one model is for beginners and the other is for more advanced workouts. This was awesome because it eased me into working out on a more consistent basis.
I did take before and after pics of working out over 30 days and I did see a difference in my body regarding my stomach and muscles being more toned.
I really like this DVD and would suggest it. And, I used it after I had my twins and it helped me get back into the swing of things for working out after babies.",1415318400,7,974,4.264864864864865

3082989,3,B00127RAJY,"These workouts are effective for a minimal time commitment, as long as you give it your all. I get bored to death doing the same thing over and over again so when I do the 30DS, I do a MWF circuit going up a level each day.

The 3 stars are purely for how effective these workouts can be. I still haven't decided how much I like working out with Jillian. She says things like ""It's hard for us too"" while standing there, not doing her own workout. Or she'll claim that if you do the workout on Natalie's level, you will actually look like Natalie ""in no time."" Yeah right. The low point is when she tells us to think of bathing suit shopping. C'mon, bathing suit shopping? What is this, a Cathy comic?

I also find the cool-down to be very insufficient. If you are going to do 30DS with regularity, please consider adding in a separate stretching routine. This workout will stiffen you up ""in no time."" And last- be very careful with the lunges and squats. They move quick and if you're not used to compound movements, you can easily lose track of your knees while you focus on your arms. This will give you messed up knees ""in no time.""",1414972800,2,1137,4.283720930232558

Well after 2 weeks of doing this workout, I noticed my knees would hurt sooo bad whenever I would bend down and I thought it was something that would go away. So I continued the workout for another 2 weeks. One afternoon I bent my neck down and heard a crack and picked my head up and this INTENSE paralyzing pain shot down my spine and my shoulders, I was in agonizing pain!!! I thought maybe it's the workout? Well a few days later it got better and I continued the workout for about another 3 weeks (not doing it everyday) than one morning that same pain happened again!! So I immediately went to the chiropractor and got adjusted and stopped the video! It's been 4 weeks since I've stopped and have not experienced pain like that again. Now mind you I snowboarded and did p90x and have NEVER in my life experienced knee pain or neck pain like that. I'm contributing this workout to that pain because Jillian does not emphasize on stretching! Which is sooooo important! I recommend noone buy this!

There's something about her tone of voice I just couldn't stand. I went back to using P90x and Zumba instead.,1413590400,,410,4.1375
3083054,5,B00127RAJY,"When I began 30 day shred, I wait a little over 200 pounds and was struggling to do a jumping jack. I did each level for one week and then switched though I did stay on the beginning level modification. At the end of the program I had lost 35 pounds. Since then I've added six weeks six pack and burn fat boost metabolism into my workout routine. After 125 straight days of doing one of her workouts each day, I am down 55 pounds total and still losing. The routines work and when you add healthy eating habits do the mix, the results are incredible. I sweat profusely during each and every work out and feel it the next day... but I feel great and look amazing.",1413590400,36,662,4.1796875
3083055,4,B00127RAJY,This work out video was good a little harder than what I wanted.,1413590400,,64,4.0
3083056,5,B00127RAJY,"This review is really my personal diary to keep myself accountable. So far I think the workout is 5 star since I feel like I'm not wasting my time. I actually sweat and feel a bit sore afterward. I really have fallen waaayyyyy off the wagon with exercise. I ran track in middle school, was a cheerleader in high school and stayed pretty active afterward until I had my daughter several years ago. Then more life happened...my dad passed away last year from cancer and I had the supervisor from hell last year who tried to get me fired so exercise fell by the wayside just due to sheer depression over all of that.
  Fast forward to the present. I've decided screw this surviving to see another paycheck with a job I hate. I'm going to at least try to look good while doing it. So I've FINALLY taken up exercise again. I lost about 10 lbs back in the spring just from changing my diet to a more Paleo/Primal style. I've never really been a rice/bread/grain person anyway so it fits me well. I started doing my old standby Walk Away the Pounds during the summer, but kind of slacked with that. So now I've discovered this 30 day shred in the past couple of weeks. I work from home so really started to notice in the past month or so that I've lost a lot of muscle definition just from being home for the past 7 years. It was really disconcerting. So what I really want is to gain my fitness level back. Plus, I don't have the money for a new wardrobe. In addition to that, I don't have the money for cosmetic surgery. I'm one of those who don't have a large chest so a flabby gut just doesn't suit me. I can be flat chested, but damn if I'm going to be flat chested with a huge gut lol!
  Anyhow, I'm going to update this review every so often. I'll include what I did each day and we'll see where I end up afterward. I'm not going ham with this. I've been there done that when I killed my knees doing Slim in 6 when I was in my 20s. I didn't know anything about resting every other day after doing a workout like that. Needless to say, the older I get my knees just can't take the heavy squatting etc. Although I will admit my legs looked absolutely gorgeous after doing Slim in 6. Just shame on Debbie Siebers (sp?) for not giving good advice about how often to do the workout. That's why I like Lindsey Brin so much. Anyway, I digress...so with this workout at my older age (I'm late 30s...okay not ancient, but these knees say otherwise...) I'm planning to do things differently. I still believe I can have the body I want, but I'll just get it at a slower pace. So for any of you with creaky knees or who haven't worked out in ages I'd suggest investing in some Biofreeze and knee braces (heck elbow and wrist braces if needed!) before even attempting this work out. Oh yeah, also one of those nifty ice packs where you put the ice in and screw the top on. So I have my Biofreeze ready, the ice pack and I have my two knee braces. I'm ready! (I also bought Tiger Balm before I got my Biofreeze from Amazon. My daughter kept asking Mommy what is that? It smells delicious! LOL!) The whole point is to be prepared for any muscle soreness and whatnot. *I plan to write updates for every day that it takes me to get to 30 days. So I'm sure this review will be LOOONNNNNGGGGGG!!! Plus, I'll be able to see what the heck I'm doing and what, if any, excuses I come up with not to do the workout. So here's what I've done so far and I'll continue to update when I have time.

Day 1- Shred, Level 1 (feeling pumped like I accomplished something. Hey, maybe I can do this whole thing through with a rest day after every 6 days. Yeah!)

Day 2-Shred, Level 1 (calves are tight as hell! LOL! Uh...about doing this workout for 6 days straight...)

Day 3- Walk Away the Pounds (30 minute workout dvd) (Thinking I better take it easy before I put myself in the hospital. Doing the moves in Walk Away helped soothe my tight, achy muscles. I actually feel better and more stretched after this workout.)

Day 4-Shred, Level 1 (This day is SO much better! I feel stronger. Calves are still sore, but not crazy sore like the first 2 days. I slapped some Tiger Balm on my knees beforehand along with wearing a knee brace on my left knee. It was great! I could get through the workout without a whole lot of pain. I'm still doing the moves at low impact, but I can get through them. Just don't want to overdue ANYTHING. I want to get stronger and stronger before attempting anything crazy. Still broke a sweat and felt satisfied afterward.)

Day 5- no exercise, rest day

Day 6- Shred Level 1 (this day was okay. Much more energy since I took Sat. off)

Day 7-Shred level 1 (meh. A little sore from yesterday. My butt and lower back are sore. I want to get stronger but all things in due time. I'm soooooout of shape! Grrrr! I just keep watching YouTube video results for inspiration. If I can get over this initial hump that'd be great. Jillian cracks me up. I love when she says 'you can't phone it in!' I'd have a problem if she were talking to children, but this is an adult workout video so I don't see the problem with her style. It actually motivates me since I know she's right. This gut ain't going anywhere if I don't suck it up and sweat!)

Day 8-Shred Level 1 (I wasn't even going to do the workout today. I thought I'd do Walk Away the Pounds, but I was angry about my dead end job situation so I thought, screw this! I can't control my situation at the present moment, but I can work out! So i worked out to release some frustration and anger. it helped. I sweated more today and felt stronger with my anger fueling my energy. Maybe I'll get through 6 days this week. We'll see.)

Day 9- Shred Level 1 (I'm still at it. I've discovered that having momentum behind me is going to help me stick this out i.e. doing the workout 6 days in a row with one rest day instead of doing it every other day (like I really think it should be done). It's geared toward getting results so that probably won't happen if I take an 'every other day' approach. Some other things I do is start walking in place while she's doing the intro talk that you can't skip. That way my muscles are more warmed up. I also bought Madeline Lewis's AM/PM stretch so I'll do that every day after the workout when I get it. I'm also going to take Epsom salt baths whenever I feel the need to in addition to continuing to slathering Biofreeze all over my muscles before I work out. That stuff is amazing! My endurance is getting better. I can do all the push ups in Lv 1, yay me! I still have a ways to go with the endurance though. I see a small difference in my gut. Mind you I still look preggo if I'm not wearing spanx, a big t shirt or camoflaging (sp?) in some way, but it does look like it's shrinking ever so slightly. That's an awesome sign. Maybe if I keep this up it'll actually shrink like other people's did in all those Youtube videos I've watched.

Day 10-Rest day (Finally! I didn't get a whole lot of rest though. Went to a party and drank way too much. :( )

Day 11-Shred, Level 1 (Up and at 'em again although I didn't really feel like working out today after partying last night. Oh well. No excuses for today. Plus, I'm so afraid of not working out and losing the fitness level I've gained so far. I DO NOT want to start this process over. It was hell just starting out with this. My lower back and upper left butt cheek still hurt for some reason. I'm powering through it though. I just keep using Biofreeze. I also iced it last night to reduce inflammation. I see my abs changing so I'm not going to stop. I SO want a flatter stomach and tight abs. I may not get 100% of that with just doing Shred which is why I plan to keep going after this with Ripped in 30.)

Day 12-Shred, Level 2 (I'm up to level 2 now. First day. It's definitely tougher than level 1. I do not recommend anyone to just jump right into this level unless you've been working out regularly and use weights regularly. Overall, the workout is fine. It's harder, but very doable for me since I've got level 1 under my belt. I felt really good after doing level 1 those 10 days. My fitness level improves daily. I still do any knee bending carefully and don't go as deep as the advanced girl, but I can do the exercises more rigorously i.e. jumping jacks are stronger, butt kicks higher. Anyhow, Jillian jumps right out the gate on this one with walking push ups for the first exercise after the warm up. I have to bend my knees all the way down then just do a plank. I tried a few push ups on a few. It's hard! At the end, you think she'll give you a break with the ab exercises. Nope. It's those plank twists. I was thinking really??? Once I get used to the exercises and perfect my form I'm sure I'll master level 2. It may take me all the 10 days, but I'm SO excited to see what my belly looks like after this level.

Day 13-16-Shred, Level 2 (So I've completed 5 days total of level 2. It's definitely no walk in the park. It's harrrrdddddd! I limped to the finish line today thankful that tomorrow is my rest day and Sunday I can work out when I want instead of first thing in the a.m. My belly is in a battle of wills with this workout and my bad eating habits. I haven't done a great job of watching my carbs. Chocolate and wine have taken over many a night unfortunately. I'm hoping that exercise will overcome the need for my body to hold onto this belly fat even though my eating is crap. The thought of how far I've come keeps me going. I'll just keep working out and finish the Shred then move onto Ripped in 30. At least working out will help keep my belly in check even if I can't or won't do better with my eating. It's hard not to drink wine after a long day of doing a job I hate. Oh well.

Day 17-22 Shred, Level 2 & 1st day of Level 3 (Yaaaayyyy!!! I made it through 10 days of level 2! It was hard I must say. I've gained enough of a fitness level that I could do the exercises with correct form and some gusto, but I still modified some for my knees and butt. For some reason, either butt cheek hurts off and on. Icing them helps. So I was ready for level 3 to be this terrible monster in the closet, but it really wasn't! I didn't sweat nearly as much as I did in level 2. It really wasn't too terribly hard. I'm not complaining because level 2 was a bear! With level 3, I'll try to do more of the advanced moves at a higher intensity level. I absolutely won't do those jumping lunges. It feels too awkward to do and my butt can't handle it. Same goes for the rock star jumps. Nope. Those are NOT happening. I am not pulling any butt muscles. So anyway, now that I'm determined to eat sensibly and do this workout, I'm hoping it'll help me reduce my body fat percentage. It looks like it takes mountains to lose body fat. I think it'll mostly depend on me eating right while the exercise burns it off. I'm just not going to see the muscles underneath this layer of fat on my gut if I don't stick to a good diet and this exercise. Period. End of story. So I'm looking forward to completing 10 days of level 3. After Shred, I'm moving right into Ripped in 30. I want a lean belly BAD!!! LOL! I've never had a problem with any other body part EXCEPT my belly. It's never been flat. It wasn't bulging like it is now when I was younger, but after having a baby, man!

Day 23-Shred, Level 3 (Today was my second day doing level 3. I take back what I said about it being easy. I worked up a good sweat today! I still think level 2 is harder though. I guess because of all the jumping around. I like that level 3 has plank moves. I read somewhere that doing planks and push ups are more effective at slimming and flattening abs than crunches. I will say that Level 3 seems to zoom by which is awesome! The circuits just seem to go by so much faster. Maybe because I'm more fit now.

So my more objective opinion (for my health, fitness level and preferences!) is this:

Warm up- There's no way in he*l I'm doing double jump ropes in a warm up. I'll do the regular ones. I don't think you should kill yourself in a warm up. That's the whole point-to warm up your muscles so you don't get injured right? I'm also NOT doing butt kicks with my past tush soreness. I do jumping jacks instead.)

Circuit 1- I love the plank exercise at the beginning. Like I said, I want to burn belly fat and flatten my abs. Planks are perfect. I think the superman exercise strengthens your back muscles and belly for that matter which is going to help me reach my goal of slimmer abs. I love the mountain climbers in the cardio section of circuit 1. I can actually do them! I'm not saying I'm not tired afterward, but I believe the upper body strength I've built up really helps me be able to do them. On to those dam* sumo squats. I hate them! I have a feeling though that my thighs are going to get slimmer and I'll develop more quad strength which I need.

Ab exercises-The ab exercises in all the circuits are fine for me except the scissor kicks. Those are hard. Plus, I don't think I have a lot of lower back strength.

Circuit 2- Strength-I'm absolutely NOT doing those jumping lunges. They just seem dangerous and I feel too awkward doing them. I do the forward lunges while holding weights. Cardio-the boxing with the weights is hard, but I like that I'm building upper body strength. I do the butt kicks with the weights during this time since I'm actually warmed up and working out, but I still take it easy. I don't do the jumping jacks with the weights. Just don't like those. I do jumping jacks or double jump ropes instead with no weights.

Circuit 3-Strength-I like the traveling push ups. Again, helps me develop more upper body strength. I still have to bend my knees with push ups. I like the row and leg lifts. Maybe those will sculpt my butt even more. Cardio-I'm absolutely NOT doing rock star jumps. I don't care what those will sculpt. My butt can't handle those. I like the jump squats though.

All in all, I'm digging level 3. Level 1 will probably be a cake walk if I ever do it again (which I probably will when I'm done with Ripped in 30 and begin rotating workouts.) I still feel a way about level 2 which is why I'll challenge myself to do that workout every now and then (probably on a Sunday when I can do it later in the day and relax afterward). It was just a hard workout and not my favorite of the bunch.

Day 24-30 (Woo hoo! I'm officially DONE with the 30 day Shred! I never stick to anything so this is a real accomplishment for me. Am I totally shredded? No. Maybe if I hadn't eaten like a pig the first 2 weeks my body fat percentage would be lower, but no use in crying over spilled milk. Onward and upward, right? Really, the only bad part about this workout is that I didn't wake up sooner and really start doing it seriously i.e. eating right. I actually did those dangerous looking rock star jumps on my last day today! Booty all healed so I thought I'd give them a try. They actually weren't that bad. All in all, I'm MUCH stronger. I can do push ups (still on my knees, but they're strong), I can do mountain climbers with no problem since my arms and shoulders are stronger. I can even do those horrible sumo squats without totally dying during the first set. Don't ask me about the second set though. :) My butt is noticeably smaller and lifted. I had no idea it had spread and flattened so much! It's hot now! My legs, arms and shoulders look awesome. These have never been my trouble spots. I have my muscle tone and definition back in those areas. The thorn in my side is my stomach. Always has been. I see my 6 pack when I'm doing double jump rope etc. but, of course, it disappears when I'm not holding it in. On the bright side, my belly is smaller. Looks like I've lost an inch from it. I have to keep going with Ripped in 30 though. I'm hoping that now that I'm eating right and following the dvd to the letter that the belly fat will melt away. If all of it doesn't I'm just going to keep going till I get what I want. I want my belly to look like Anita's or something similar. She's small chested like me so with her belly super flat everything is in proportion. I can't have the slightest gut since I don't have a chest to compensate for it. It just irks me to no end which is why I'm continuing with Ripped in 30, level 1 tomorrow.

3083058,5,B00127RAJY,"This really was a fantastic workout to start with. I did the workouts 6 days a week, making sure all days added up to 30 (so I went for over a month, when you count the days off). I did not change my diet; I did not change anything. As a natural consequence, I drank more water. I bought her Master Your Metabolism book; and I made sure I took 20 minutes a day to do this. I wrote about my results (with pictures) at bigserious.hubpages.com.

I recommend a few things: drink water; never work out on an empty stomach; you don't have to keep up, just keep moving. What you struggle with in week one is easy by week four. It's really fun. And TAKE PICTURES. My pant size did not change; my weight did not change. But if you look at the photos, it's quite clear my body changed. So don't trust numbers! Take pictures!

The workouts are intense enough to actual feel like you are doing a workout with intention. I am one who doesn't like to workout but with this video it was a quick 20 min workout and I was able to work my self up from level 1 then on to level 2 and then finally when I made it to level 3 I was so proud of myslef and significantly stronger, more lean and fit. Not only did it change my body but it gave me the confidence I needed too. When first starting on level one I thought man this is tough but now after making it to level 3 and going back to level one I can see the major change and how much easier I fly through the workouts! Jillian knows what she is doing iv bought a few more of her DVDs since and I absolutely LOVE them as well!

3083074,5,B00127RAJY,"Purchased this dvd to get myself into working out more regularly. Wanted a video that didn't require any additional equipment and was less than 30 minutes. THIS IS PERFECT! I started with Level 1 which was brutal at first, once I got used to it I tried Level 2 and then Level 3. I like how she has the 'easy' version in the background in case there are parts where you get tired and then the more challenging version when you are ready for more. Once you do this for a couple weeks straight the Levels become pretty easy, I started stacking doing 2 levels in one workout or doing one session from this video and then one session from her 6 week six-pack video.",1413244800,3,660,4.288
3083075,4,B00127RAJY,"The workouts are challenging, but they are not so challenging that you can't get through it.  It took me about three tries to make it through the Level one workout completely and I am pretty much as much of a beginner as you could be.  I haven't lost any weight yet, but I can tell it is making a difference around the tummy area, my belly feels nice and tight and it hasn't felt like that since I was thirty years younger.  Jillian has so many different workouts, its hard to figure out which one is the one that you should start with when you're a beginner, this one might not be the ""best"" choice for a beginner, but I think that its totally doable for a beginner, and I really like that there are three different levels with beginner and advanced versions for the exercises.  One thing I noticed, if you read the outside of the box on the label it mentions ""diet and exercise"" which would probably lead one to believe that there is a diet plan on the DVD somewhere, and I don't think that there is - but having said that, I am only on level one so maybe its on there somewhere, if you're looking for a diet plan you might not find that, but you will find a challenging fun workout that is completely within reach for someone who is just starting out, and I think you will be pleased that you seem to see results right away.",1413158400,2,1327,4.21259842519685

3083103,4,B00127RAJY,"I have had the video for a few years now.  Started again 2 weeks ago and starting to see results.  I switch up each day and rotate between 1/2/3.  You can make any level more difficult by adding 5 or 8 lb weights depending on the exercise.  I find them equally difficult by doing this and helps the eventual boredom you can get from doing videos.

I love that they take 30 minutes total time, I like the addition of weights to give cardio and weight training.  I never lost much weight if any while doing this but certainly saw results in time.  My clothes are fitting better.  Toning is my big problem as opposed to weight loss.

I did Insanity a few years ago but got a terrible back injury so I'm fairly cautious now.  I don't seem to have any issues with this video.

I wish she had another version of this so I could add to the mix, I have bought several others but this is my favorite.  Some jumped from the floor to standing too often and too quickly, I liked that this is a smooth transition and only 30 minutes.

The first video is challenging, especially if you are not in great shape, but not so difficult that most people will find it impossible to finish. If you're not used to working out, you will definitely be sore for a few days after you do this workout for the first time! I do not recommend doing the same video in the series for too many days in a row if you have joint or knee issues--sometimes I find myself having knee pain if I don't take a day in between doing a video. You can also alternate the levels to mitigate this problem (e.g., do level 1 one day, level 2 the next, then level 1 again). The intensity of this video is definitely high enough that you will see results if you use it consistently and also alter your diet. Another plus is that it's short enough that you can fit into your day very easily!",1411776000,,973,4.1534391534391535

I worked out 3-4 times a week at first and later increased to 5-6 when I got in better shape. I started with 3lb weights and now use 8lb dumbells and 10 & 15lb kettle bells. I was very out of shape to start and now have lost 25lbs and am in good shape. My only regret is not moving up a level sooner at first, because repeating the same workout can be very boring.

I have lost 43 pounds in 5 months and I'm still losing. I workout with Jillian every morning and use the DVD five times a week (Monday-Friday) and take the weekends to rest. I NEVER thought this short 24 minute DVD would be able to get these results. I am a size 0 now, fitting into skinny jeans, and I feel better about myself then I have in a long time!

3083239,5,B00127RAJY,"I was looking for something that was quick and effective. This DVD is it. Due to the short length of workout routines, it was super easy to fit into my schedule and I instantly felt stronger. I didn't exactly loose a bunch of weight, but that is probably due to the amount of food I was eating... went on many family visits and it is hard to resist family and grub! But I am fully confident if I ate healthy I would have lost some weight (Also I am not exactly super overweight or anything... but I could loose a good 30 I suppose lol) The only complaint is that this workout is a little hard on the knees. Now I am only 24 and have no prior knee injuries or anything like that, but my knees were cracking and under stress during some of the moves.

3083241,5,B00127RAJY,"I have never seen an episode of THE BIGGEST LOSER and, before purchasing JILLIAN MICHAELS 30 DAY SHRED, had never used a fitness DVD before. In 2009, after several years of having no fitness or exercise regimen, I wanted to begin a training regimen to get back in shape. At the time, I didn't have the finances to afford a gym membership, but a friend of mine recommended JILLIAN MICHAELS 30 DAY SHRED. I purchased the DVD and used it for a six month period and it was extremely helpful.

Other than a tv with a working DVD player and a space to workout, all one needs is a couple of hand weights and maybe an exercising mat. There are three different workouts on the DVD. The easiest is Level 1, Level 2 is moderate, and Level 3 is the most challenging. Each workout consists of a 2-minute warm-up. These are followed by a series of 3 circuits that are 6-minutes-long. Each circuit consists of 3 minutes of strength, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, followed by 1 minute of ab. Finally, the workout ends with a 2-minute cool down. Although there are some exercises that are repeated, none of the circuits are completely repetitive.

You are supposed to use this program by working out on Level 1 for 10 days, then progressing to Level 2 for 10 days, before finally ending with a 10-day-workout on Level 3. Initially when I purchased this DVD, I followed the program. However, I ended working out with it for about 6 months. So, after completing the initial program, I started over, but would mix it up: I worked on Level 1 for a day, the next day I would do Level 3, the next day I might do Level 1 or Level 2, etc. There would also be some days that I would do a series of two workouts: for instance Level 3 followed by Level 1 or maybe two rounds of Level 2.

During the first 30 days I followed the program, I lost about 12 pounds and was definitely more toned and in shape. After six months of using it, I had lost about 20 pounds.

Overall, JILLIAN MICHAELS 30 DAY SHRED is a great workout video for anyone who wants to a workout video to use at home. If you stick to the program, it will help you get in shape.",1408060800,8,2117,4.271820448877805

3083254,5,B00127RAJY,"Effectiveness: 10/10
I'm 5'2, woman and weighed 141 lb. I was 170 lb and lost 25 lb from jogging for almost a year. Although running for 6 months helped me lose the 25 lb, this workout will help you burn off those fats and flabs if you complete this workout dvd properly. I'm on day 24 and lost more 4 lb which is great because I was on a 6 frustrating months of plaque. I don't see significant difference in my physical appearance (because I'm chubby) until day 20 or 21 which was  when I began level 3. My butt, thighs, lower arms and upper arms are more toned and firmer. It also helped me tone up to rid those stretch marks from when I lost 25 lb.

My strength significantly increased too! I gained a lot of endurance and speed since trying 30 day shred. My time for a run improved a lot than my run time before I tried 30 day shred (12 min/mile before, 10 min/mile after in a 3 mile run). I can feel more power from my muscles,  and my legs can push me faster when I run,  and I can sprint for minutes longer.

I'm pretty sure that if I do this workout again for a total of 60 days working out, I will have the perfect toned body I want. But I will, instead, try Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 for the extra challenge.

Difficulty: Very hard
Doing these workout dvd is intense circuit training. It's much more intense than my normal circuit training with my trainer who I paid $60 per session at the gym! And I feel that I get alot more workout doing this 25 min workout with Jillian than 1 hour. $12.00 for a great workout dvd is a very sweet deal.

At my current state, I'm still considered overweight but this workout is doable. It's challenging, but because the workout is so short, and Jillian MIchaels is such a great motivator, 25 minutes will zip by fast!

Motivation: 9/10
I've tried Chalean's Turbo Jam dvd workout, and Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs workout, and Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is my favorite. Unlike Chalean and Shaun T, I found Jillian more motivating, helping me push harder for another minute in each circuit. There are 3 levels of training with level 1 being doable but very tough to level 3 being almost impossible to complete without a minute break. With that being mentioned, each level must be done for 10 days (workout level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 more days, and level 3 for 10 more days). Therefore, it is likely you'll get bored from listening and training with the training for 10 days. But Jillian is tough but very motivating, and doesn't have those annoying noises and phrases that I see from other workout dvds. Sometimes, I do switch it up, but listening and working with Jillian doing the same workout for 10 days is manageable.

Overall all rating: 9.5/10
Of all workout videos, this one is my favorite because this DVD can give you more than you can ask for: burn fat, get toned, increase strength, saves you big time and money from going to the gym, great workout workout in a short time. If you're looking to get in good shape, this dvd is great even for the fittest people.

3083279,5,B00127RAJY,"I was always a little intimidated by Jillian Michaels, by reputation.  When I decided it was time to really get serious about losing weight, I found the first of these workouts on YouTube.  I've been using it for the past few weeks, and I can honestly say I understand why Jillian is such a popular trainer!  Personalities differ, but I found her to be very motivating and encouraging.  I don't need a peppy, cheerleader type.  I need someone grounded who is explaining things to me - WHY is circuit training so effective, WHY do we work arms and legs together, and why 20 minutes of serious work can be more effective than going to the gym and ""phoning it in"".  She acknowledges that some exercises are tough, especially for beginners, but she also doesn't allow you to slack off.  I am now going to order the DVD so I can use all three workouts.  I still jump back to my favorite kickboxing DVD sometimes (10 minute solutions with Keli Robers - also highly recommend!), but I think this will become my go to workout.",1407456000,,1018,4.494565217391305

Lost the weight I wanted and now do it 3 times a week to maintain. Its especially good since you can do everything at home and it only takes 30 minutes. The DVD says 20 but by the time you set up everything and watch the promos its more like 30. Still my friends and I quote it all the time. Stop phoning it in etc. There really is no need for a gym membership unless you want to be a professional body builder. This should be taught at schools and even at colleges.

3083462,5,B00127RAJY,"I first began working out to the 30 Day Shred a year ago today, but never got around to leaving a review for some reason.  Since I truly believe this DVD is a game changer, especially for beginners, as well as it being my ""anniversary"" today, I felt it was now fitting to finally leave a review for this awesome workout.

First some context...I am a 33 year old Asian female who has been a bit overweight for most of my adult life. I didn't weigh myself before I began my exercise journey, but I believe I was close to 160 lbs. and wore XL most of the time.  However, I am not the stereotypical petite Asian as I am about 5'6, so the extra pounds on me were not too bad looking, except for the fact that I had a belly! I think this was due mostly to the fact that I never worked out before the 30 Day Shred (except for gym classes in school) and poor diet choices; I do shift work so I often ate again after work around midnight and eating chips and instant noodles weren't helping either.  Also, I suffered from low self esteem for a long time, so I was also guilty of ""emotional eating"", eating when I wasn't really that hungry but just to feel better.

The turning point for me was in 2012 when I went on a date and the guy (whom I met online) told me blatently, ""You would be a 10 in the looks dept. if it weren't for your excess weight!"".  I was crushed beyond belief, and afterwards when I got home, I took a long look at myself in the mirror and told myself that I had enough, and I was sick of being fat as well as constantly being told that I am (you see, I also had a lot of co-workers who were rude enough to often ""remind"" me that I am fat!).  So I considered buying a certain popular home gym but when I found out it was beyond my budget and hard to set up, I gave up and thought about joining my local gym.  So I went in for a trial period, but I was lost as to what I should be doing or even how, and I was told that I needed to set up time with staff just to be acquainted with those machines! What's worse, I was hounded by the sales there about membership fees as well as getting a personal trainer, since I was a newbie! I couldn't afford all that and just going to the gym seemed like a hassle to me, so I walked out, and felt bad as I really wanted to get in shape! But as I was leaving the gym, I saw a poster in there with Jillian's pic advertising her ""Shred"" classes and a lightbulb went inside my head! I could workout at home to a DVD!

So I asked one of my online friends, who is a personal trainer, about working out at home and she told me that it was indeed possible; I just needed a mat and some weights, for exercises like squats, lunges, etc.  I told her that my biggest concern was to shed fat, so she recommended that I focus on cardio.  I went to Ebay, and just punched in ""cardio dvd"" in the search box, and I saw Jillian's 30 Day Shred and Denise Austin's Cardio DVD at first glance, and I decided to buy both, just to see which I liked better.  I started Denise's first, but she just seemed to annoy me (no offence to Denise fans) and it was a bit dancey for me....so I tried Jillian's next; since it was called the 30 Day Shred, I decided to start at the beginning of the next month, which was July 1, 2013.  Prior to starting it, I read a lot of rave reviews online about the Shred, so I decided it was worth a shot!

On the first day of level 1, I remember wanting to die!! So many jumping jacks! I felt out of breath within 10 mins but I didn't want to give up.  Jillian's legendary motivation got me through it, although I was incredibly sore afterwards.  BTW, I never heard of The Biggest Loser before this workout, so I didn't know anything about Jillian beforehand.  I did each level for 10 days each, but I remember also doing level 3 on the 31st as well.  I did the Shred for the actual 31 days straight with no rest days, which in hindsight, is sorta crazy now!  I just kept plugging away everyday for that month and I was shocked when co-workers started asking me if I was losing weight within 2 weeks, I guess when I was into level 2, as I did sweat the most during level 2 and it was a big step up from level 1! I also remember my clothes feeling a bit looser during the halfway point.  I was just amazed that I saw results so soon and without following a strict diet; I just tried to eat sensibly and had a protein shake after my workouts, so perhaps that helped to curb my appetite a bit!

As you can guess, I was pretty pleased with the quick results of this workout at the end of that month, so I quickly ordered a few other Jillian DVDs, Ripped in 30 was my next one.  I knew that this was the beginning of the ""new"" me, and my self confidence grew day by day as well.  I didn't weigh myself at all for fear of being demotivated by the number on the scale.  Instead, I went by what I saw in the mirror as well as my clothes getting looser as days went by.  I couldn't believe that I could achieve such results with a DVD that didn't break the bank! This might sound bizarre, since a lot of people have commented on how Natalie ""cheats"" in Jillian's DVDs, but I found Anita and Natalie to be quite inspirational during the workouts for some reason.  I also didn't think the music was that bad either! Level 2 was my fave and now my go to when I am in a pinch, sometimes level 3, but I now hardly break out a sweat during level 1, which tells you a lot!

In the past year, I have become a big Jillian fan and now also have Yoga Meltdown, BFBM, NMTZ, Hard Body, and Killer Buns and Thighs (which also feature Anita and Natalie!) and I plan on getting her other ones in the near future.  I now rotate all of these DVDs throughout the week but have found that since I have gotten stronger and fitter in the year since I started the Shred, I now prefer the longer workouts like BFBM, which has boosted my results since it's pure cardio.  But when I am in a time crunch, I will do the Shred!  This workout will always have a soft spot in my heart because it was the first workout I ever did! I owe it to Jillian for all these awesome results, since I now wear a S.  I love everything about her instructional style! Yes, even her ""constant chatter"", as it motivates me and I love her quotes as well....""When you get stronger physically, it will transcend into every other facet of your life"" comes to mind.  Jillian is a godsend for the home exerciser!",1404172800,"1,444",6403,4.049128367670365

You don't do each move for too long which helps with not getting board or feeling like you can't possibly do more of it.  So you move quickly from jumping jacks for 30 seconds to jumprope for 30 seconds.  She's motivational, she's tells you what's coming up.  I really, really like it.  I originally bought a Tracy Anderson DVD and her cuing was just SO horrific I could never get into it.  But I really think this one will help me be consistent. I don't know Jillian from TV so maybe some of you will have heard her motivational stuff before but for me it's new and I like it.

I didn't have much faith that a 20 minute video could do much, but Jillian is seriously amazing, this workout has given me beautiful definition in my arms and legs, and my waist is getting smaller!  I do the DVD 4 to 5 times per week, plus an aerobics class and maybe 1 run per week.

My knees were swollen and hurt so much after 10 days following her program. Her program completely damaged my knee joints. I had to stop working out completely for over a year to recover. It was a long and painful road. Working out and staying fit is a long term effort. Once you are injured, you are out of the game.
I hope whoever read my post will be extra careful in caring for their knees while following Jillian Michaels's workout approach and philosophy that emphasizing strenuous routines that guarantee results in a very short time.
Meanwhile, thought I'd like to share with you all my favorite workout routines are Denise Austin, Jackie Warners, Tracy Anderson, Mary Helen Bowers, Rodney Yee (yoga). These instructors are more methodical and they all stress on the importance of keeping up the good work on a regular basis to see long term beautiful results, as the same time prevent joint damage and injuries.

After about 2 years my weight had increased by 15 - 20 lbs. , but my thyroid was back to normal by then with the help of natural hormones. I had tried to exercise off and on either walking or doing some of my other workout videos, but have had such a hard time getting motivated. Maybe it's from not doing it for so long or maybe it's my age?? I decided I needed to order a new ""better"" workout video and found this one just by chance. I read the reviews and thought ""ok, I'll give it a try"", even though I felt discouraged and wasn't sure I'd like it or that it would work. I started using it on Wednesday, June 4. Today is Wednesday, June 11. I alternate Workout 1 and Workout 2, and modify when necessary, so I'm not doing the same workout every day. I'll move on to Workout 3 in another week or so. In one week I've lost 3 lbs. by using this video, eating healthy, including cutting out alcohol and other sugars! I am so excited! I feel like I used to before my thyroid issue. I feel more energetic! My muscles are sore, but I love that feeling because I know it's changing my body! The first couple of days were the toughest, but I just pushed myself because I want to see if what Jillian says is true. I will never know if I don't try it. I also can't say ""it doesn't work"" if I don't give it my all. So, what have I got to lose, except weight and fat. I do it first thing in the morning. There's no excuse. With warm ups and stretching at the end, it's a total of about 25 - 30 min. I love it! I can see how it works because you are doing upper and lower body together, as well as cardio. It's non-stop movement and it seems to go by fast. You MUST try it! Thanks Jillian! I'll try to give another update after another week or two.",1402444800,6,1914,4.0

So, instead I used a lot of Leslie Sansone's DVDs to build up my fitness & strength level (leslie Sansone's walk it off in 30 days is excellent for beginners to build strength and endurance). A year passed by & I decided to give this DVD another try, & I was soooo amazed at myself for being able to complete level 1 WITHOUT doing the modifications!! So, I was inspired to complete the DVD in 30 days; which I did, and the results are amazing!!!  I am now hooked on Jillian, and own almost all of her DVDs!

I love everything about Jillian, from her style to her personality. She is motivating and inspirational.  Her workouts are time efficient and fat/calorie burners; perfect and ideal for a working mom like myself!

SIde note:  On days where I didn't feel like working out I would go hiking or swimming.  Mixing in those activities with this DVD gave me more success than any other workout I have tried.

Tip: Stay off the scale for the first 30 days.  I was weighing myself weekly to see if I lost weight and was disappointed when I saw no results.  I stayed off the scale...continued along..then when my clothes were noticeably looser I hopped on the scale and was amazed to see the results!

I have been supplementing these workouts with 2-3 mile runs most days of the week and I have noticed a huge difference in my arm tone (I only use 5 lb dumbbells).  I was on level one for quite a while, slowly moving up from the modified to the advanced versions of the moves.  If you are consistent with this workout, you will start to notice a HUGE difference in your strength and stamina over the course of a few weeks, and the workouts get easier.  I am not yet on level 3 because I've recently been switching between levels 1 and 2 during the week, but I plan to get there over the next few months.  I think everyone should give this DVD a try, especially for those who don't get sick of doing the same workout several days a week.",1400716800,,888,4.230769230769231

I don't work out at all and when I first started, the next day I was falling apart sore, but I did my workout anyways and lemme tell you, this chick knows how to keep you motivated. She's tough, not like those bean sprout walking enthusiasts who tell you to do what you can. She makes you work for it and she obviously knows what she's doing. So this is totally worth the buy.

3083653,5,B00127RAJY,"If you are ready for a hard workout that gets results, then this is the one for you.  Jillian is a tough trainer, no questions asked.  Her workouts are tough but not impossible.  I don't understand the people who criticize her workout dvds because they don't like how she talks through them and barks orders, if thats all you don't like, all you gotta do is put on music or mute the dvd.  For me, that actually  motivates me, because I need someone telling me I can do this particular exercise if 400 lb people can do it, and I need to hear how I need to keep going even if I want to stop or give up. It aint a cakewalk, and no reason to pretend like it is.  If you want someone who speaks in a more positive, uplifting tone, try Richard Simmons.. see what results you get from him though  I think a lot of people misunderstand her sense of humor, and take it as her being rude or harsh.  Biggest Loser has portrayed her as this callous, hostile trainer, so people take her the wrong way when she tries to be upbeat .  You can say what you want about her, but she is a great trainer and you will get results. I have no previous experience with exercising daily, and this was my first Jillian exercise dvd and I loved it.  Well, I hated it the first few times I did it, because it was so hard to finish all the reps and I HATE CARDIO with a passion.  But you need that cardio to melt the fat.  Just push yourself through it and you will be amazed how fast your bodys endurance builds up, and pretty soon you will be able to finish a full set with no needed rest.  25 mins is about all I can commit to exercise in a day, and she really delivers.  She gives you two moderators to follow, one is tough (but cheats alot!!) and the other is for a more low impact for people like me who are just starting out, and cant keep up with the more advanced moves.  I have done this dvd (as well as Ripped in 30) for about 3 months now, and I absolutely see results. Not the kind of results that this would give me if I stuck to a better diet, or pushed myself to follow the harder moderator more often, but I am quite thrilled with my results that I am now a die-hard Jillian fan.  I have lost close to 20 lbs since starting this dvd.  I highly suggest you try this dvd and give it a good 2 weeks before you throw in the towel.. what do you have to lose, except weight!",1400544000,5,2355,4.01931330472103

3083671,5,B00127RAJY,"First, I must say, I've had this for awhile.  I tucked it away after getting through level 3 and going onto some other dvds of hers and Bob's.  I recently went back and do level 1 as a warm up to some of the other workouts I do.  I just recently noticed that good ole Natalie...level 1, circuit 2 in strength.  Static lunge with a bicep curl.  She cheats!  The camera focuses on her w/ Jillian and then when Jillian walks over to Anita, watch Nat.  She bicep curls, but doesn't lunge.  Now, I never noticed this when I was just starting this dvd....but, now I know she did that, no wonder the 'pros' make it look so easy to beginners!  What gets me, is at the beginning, Jill even says (something along the lines of): 'if you want to look like this, do what she does'.  AND...later in circuit 3, I think it's in strength, Jillian hops back into the workout and says ""they don't even cheat when I'm not looking"".  Wonder if that was a reference to circuit 2 strength when Nat DID cheat (& she knows it)??
I like this dvd and would recommend it.  It might be a little much if this is the first one you are starting out with...BUT, stick with it.  Do your best and you WILL get stronger and better.  Remember: progress, not perfection ;)  You WILL see your results.",1400112000,,1262,4.243697478991597

I thought about T25 or P90x but thought I would start out small.  This is not small.  That doesn't mean its too much for me either.  After 1 day of 20 minutes, I was sweating and my heart was racing. The next day I can feel it for sure.  I'm really excited to track my progress and to see results.  What I like most about this workout is that they give you modifications of the exercises if you are a beginner.

3083698,5,B00127RAJY,"Oh how I love Jillian! This video is perfection. It's only 20 minutes long, so it's easy to do before work, and you only have to wake up 20 minutes earlier! She breaks it down in two ways. One, it's in three levels. You start with level 1, and as it starts to get easy for you, you move up. I've been doing it about 4 times a week for two weeks now, and I think I'll move up next week. She also breaks it down into segments: 3 mins strength, 2 mins cardio, 1 min abs. And repeat 3 times. That makes the video seem so much faster! I'm definitely the type of person who counts down until a video is done, and this just makes it seem like it goes so quickly--which is GOOD for a Jillian workout!
She really does work you though; don't think that since it's only 20 minutes it's not worth it. She does a lot of combination moves, so you're working arms and legs and abs all at once in the strength section. Cardio is fast-paced and non-stop for two minutes. The abs could get harder, but I definitely feel it afterwards. You can always modify to make them more difficult based on your level. Overall it's a great workout video. I feel like my endurance has increased greatly after just two weeks doing THIS video only, and I'm down 8 pounds (plus healthy eating!).",1399766400,2,1260,4.210743801652892

I found some of Jillian's workouts on YouTube and tried them - loved them - and ordered several. For me, Jillian's commentary is more motivational than any of the others I have tried - from the dark ages - Jane Fonda - to current - Bob Harper (also from Biggest Loser).

It was so challenging that I could hardly move the second day.  We are now on our second week and at day 6 I can feel my body tightening.  I know this will give me results if I keep going.

I am very pleased with this program. I will definitely do one more month and then move on to Shredded in 30. It is not too difficult for beginners, it warms up real slow and has a smooth transition into the workout. The workout is so short by the time you think about quitting, it's already over. I personally can't stand Jillian Michaels and her ""encouragements"" throughout the videos are pretty annoying, but the results have been great.

Also, I download this to my kindle via amazon for 1.99/level and am very pleased with that. I didn't want to buy the whole DVD (that I couldn't exactly take everywhere with me if I didn't have a DVD player) and the downloads are awesome.

3083771,5,B00127RAJY,This video works. I used this with Ripped in Thirty and i lost 10 lbs so that my body wouldn't get too used to the work outs. If you only use this one it can be a bit tiresome and I wouldn't recommend doing the same workout every day. Other than that this is a fun and challenging video.,1398124800,,287,3.8813559322033897
3083772,3,B00127RAJY,"I think this is a good workout.  It definitely makes me sweat but I don't think I am getting shredded.  I have gone through level 1 and 2 and have just started level 3.  I have lost around 11 inches all over my body and 5 lbs. I do not consider that being shredded, not unless I lose 10 lbs in the next two weeks, which is not likely.",1398124800,,334,3.8115942028985508
3083773,3,B00127RAJY,"My daughter and I have been using the bootcamp workout by David Kirsch, but wanted to try something shorter and different.  We do like this workout and we can feel that it works different muscles than the bootcamp.  However, it is kind of short and we need to pause it and do a more thorough warm up as well as stretching afterward.

A couple of thing to be aware of during this workout; 1) There is a lot of jumping (jumping jacks followed by 'jump rope').  I don't feel this is good on joints because so much jumping is done on a hard floor - but we modify the way we do it to reduce impact.  Also, we both snowboard so we are extra careful as there are quite a few moves that have potential to hurt the knees (we go slower, focus on balance of the legs, etc.). 2) There is a move with 'side squats' performed while you are doing front arm raises with weights.  We do a similar one with the other bootcamp, but this one really stressed our neck muscles. We have used these same weights for all our exercises for the last 6 months, but for some reason this move felt out of balance, so it stressed our neck muscles.  To help, we modified the exercise by alternating front arm raises with side arm raises and it feels more productive.

What we really like is that there are three levels on one dvd - so once you are conditioned to level one you have your next level right there to move up to.",1398124800,11,1392,4.167910447761194

3083775,5,B00127RAJY,"I used this both as a stand alone 30 day work out and as part of my training for running. If you're looking for a total body workout to get you started, this is it. There wasn't a muscle in my body that wasn't screaming the next day after the first workout. The workouts are under a half hour, so if you're short on time (like if you're trying to sneak in a workout while your no nap nap ninja finally sleeps), this is perfect.",1397779200,,427,4.035294117647059
3083776,5,B00127RAJY,This is a really nice shorter workout. I have limited time to exercise and I like that I can still feel the burn from this workout.

I also love she has 3 settings for beginners, intermediate and hard. As I'm starting of level 1 is perfect, as it gets easier I just go onto to next level. She will push you.

3083803,5,B00127RAJY,I've been doing the biggest loser at home and wanted to step it up a notch.  I've always been a fan of Jillians and this work out DVD delivers.  I am still feeling it two days later...and that was only level 1!  I love how it operates on a 3-2-1 system so you are constantly moving but get a small break inbetween doing something over and over.  This was definitely challenging but worth every single cuss word I threw at the TV.  Can't wait to do it again tomorrow.,1397347200,,466,4.191011235955056

3083805,5,B00127RAJY,"I always read the negative reviews before I purchase a product and noticed an overwhelming amount of complaints about this dvd set being hard on the knees.  I weigh 196 lbs (hence the reason for this purchase) and was able to perform all the exercises in level 1 with no issues.  I watched level 2 and 3 and there is nothing in this set that I find to be any different than the many bootcamps I have done.  I have also completed p90x and insanity and this is a cakewalk compared to all of that.  You have to know how to land softly in order to protect your joints.  I think Jillan does a good job of stressing proper form and working at your own pace, but she could probably emphasize more the need to land softly and not pound when doing some of the higher impact moves(jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope, etc.). I also work out on carpet and don't wear any socks or shoes (did this with Insanity also)

I also love the fact that it is less than thirty minutes.  There are three 6-minute circuits and although you are working non-stop through the whole thing, it is over before you know it.  I do this in the morning and Shaun T's Rockin' Body dvd set in the evenings to mix it up.",1397260800,2,1184,4.207964601769912

The thought of an hour long class embarasses me, as most times I would give up mid-way through. Most days I feel fatigued and low energy. I bought the 30 shred video, since my other slender friend said it gave her so much strength. I am so happy I gave it a shot. Day to day, I can feel myself getting stronger. It is a tough workout, but the 20 mins is doable. And Jillian is patient and coaches you through every move so you don't injure yourself. Each day, I push myself a little bit more, and I can feel my stamina grow with each session I have! I feel my body tightening and toning. Jillian has changed my life for the better.

3083820,5,B00127RAJY,"So part of me might just love this DVD because it brings back memories of late night workouts in my dorm room with my bestie getting ready for spring break in Miami, but I think a bigger part of me loves this DVD because it is soooo good! When my bestie and I started this DVD at level 1, we felt pretty good about ourselves, thinking ""oh this isn't so bad, we can totally do this and get shredded in time for South Beach."" Oh but that was an illusion! The next day we progressed onto level 2 and within 5 minutes we were wondering what we got ourselves into. Oh man Jillian sure knows how to get down to business as she mixes cardio in with strength at just the precise moment of utter exhaustion.

I've done other insane (hint) workouts and they helped with stamina but I didn't appreciate beginner alternatives in the work out. Jillian is encouraging and funny in this workout DVD.

I must say, it is great for strength building and I love that I work up a sweat in just 20 minutes, however, my poor knees can not take the daily abuse. By day 3, my knees are aching and even when I skipped a day or two and tried to jump back in, my knees were not having it.  I never even got to workout 3 because workout 2 is pure torture, even the ""easy"" modification is unbearable.

I am certain there are those that can get through the workouts, I just can't and I am not about to damage my knees further just so I can say I shed a few pounds.  On to something else.",1396224000,3,626,3.875

Summers I tend to workout for 1-2 hours per day, 5-days a week, so a tough short workout seemed like just what I needed.

I would not recommend for those who have been sedentary for for a few months and getting started again.  I thought that is what Jillian's workouts were about.",1396137600,7,619,4.558558558558558

3083861,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm a working mom so I only have a certain window of time to devote to exercising.  What's not to love about a workout that has easy moves in 25 minutes that will make you drip sweat after the first circuit?  I say ""easy moves"" but the workout will kick your butt.  I can easily do this in the morning before I start my day because it is fast and effective (I am really not a morning person but it is so quick that it is doable at a reasonable hour).  Even though I don't look forward to working out, I am always happy I did it.

I also have her 50 minute trouble zone DVD and I just don't like it as much simply because of the length.

Her 3,2,1 system of 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs makes the workout go by fast.  And I have a girl crush on Jillian.  She rocks and I will likely try her other stuff.  But for now, I have three great workouts with enough variety to last me for awhile, and I can build on the harder moves you can upgrade to.  This is a no brainer for anyone who thinks they are too busy to workout.  And the proof is when I went bathing suit shopping (which we all dread).

Jillian tells you if you are a beginner to follow one of the girls, Jillian is moderate, and another girl is high intensity.  20 minutes doesn't sound long, but she'll have you sweating 5 minutes into the video!  I like that you don't have to buy a lot of gear to workout.  You just need a set of hand weights.",1396137600,,413,4.1125
3083864,4,B00127RAJY,"The Pros:  I love that these workouts are quick (about 20 minutes) so it's easy to fit them in.  Jillian manages to target your muscles in a variety of ways so you can feel the impact.  It's great that she shows a beginner level along with a more advanced. If there's a particular exercise that you don't like, you know it's only going to last for 1 minute before she moves on to the next one so it makes it doable.

The cons:  The music is annoying and I hate that you can't fast forward past the opening work-out warnings/beginning intro information so every time you start the DVD, you have to suffer through the opening segment.  Overall, I highly recommend this DVD.",1396051200,,671,4.414634146341464

I like that this has 3-20 minute workouts that allow for progression which means I can use this for months to come if not years.  I also like the 3-2-1 workout style Jullian uses with 3 minutes of strength moves, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs- it of course feels like an eternity while working out, but keeps the workout moving and actually you are moving on to cool down before you know it!  I can't speak to the claim that you ""lose 20 lbs in 30 days"" because I didn't workout every day.

I feel the burn by the end of the circuit! I like that there are different levels to the workout and I choose when I move up to the next work out. I like that it forces you to warm up and cool down.

3083901,5,B00127RAJY,"I loved this dvd!! I absolutely hate working out, I was a dancer for 7 years but then badly injured my knee and ankle and had to quit to do physical therapy. Naturally the weight started adding on as my metabolism slowed after going from intense 5 hour workouts 6 days a week to no exercise outside walking to class and the store.  I usually find it hard to motivate myself to work out but I decided I wanted to get back in shape so I could stop feeling held back from certain things.  Jillian is great at talking you through the exercises and continuing to motivate you to push even when you want to take a break.  The system is designed with no breaks but because of that the time flies and afterwards you are sore in the best way possible wondering how you got such a great workout in that amount of time.  Level one is enough to kick your ass, so moving up seems intimidating at first, but after a week with level one it seems more manageable cause you already start to see results.

Jillian Micheals is a beast!! and totally committed to fitting in a FULL workout in 20 mins.
My favorite thing about this workout is the time- 20 mins, non stop, workout! strengthing, cardio and abs. I am a full time mom and nurse, I need something quick, consistant and that will give me results

Each is progressively more challenging. When I first tried it, I was skeptical about how much of a workout I would be getting. I'm used to running 20 or more miles a week and lifting weights at the gym. After trying level 1, boy was I exhausted! I stuck with the workouts and grew to love them. They made part of my body sore that I didn't know could get sore. Within a month, my waist was smaller and my entire body felt firm. I noticed that my biceps and quads got a little bigger. This is not a bad thing, as it means my muscles grew stronger. The best thing about 30 Day Shred is that it's very time efficient.

Level 1 is an excellent workout, and the progression to Levels 2 and 3 are challenging but seamless. The exercises are easy to follow, and Jillian gives you different versions of most of the exercises, so there's no excuse not to try this! I really think this is one of the better at-home workouts. You won't regret buying this!",1394668800,,442,4.469135802469136
3083960,5,B00127RAJY,"After sitting on the couch for months, this workout got me back into action! Level 1 is challenging but doable, even if you haven't been active in a while. (I cheated and took 30-second breaks to grab water during my first few workouts. Jillian would not approve; you're supposed to keep moving. Shh!)

Her approach is to combine strength training and cardio into one effective 20-minute workout. Within the first week, my muscles were already starting to tone. What I especially love: She gives you beginner and advanced versions of many exercises, which is helpful. I also like her motivational style. Just when you're thinking it might be time to stop and have a brownie, she'll pipe up with, ""I know you want to turn off that DVD. Don't do it."" (A little creepy how she can read my mind, but in a good way.) And then she'll remind you why you're doing what your doing.

The progression to Level 2 and then Level 3 is natural and doable. By the cool-down, I feel like I've really worked my whole body--upper, lower, and abs. I feel stronger, leaner, and healthier in just a month. At this point, actually look forward to working out with Jillian and her two co-trainers (well, most days).

My only complaint is that I feel like a few of the ab moves strain my back a bit, so I take mini-breaks midway through if I'm feeling that strain. But overall, a great workout!",1394668800,,1369,4.534412955465587

Then you move onto level 2, do the 10 days with a break in between if u need and then level three for 10 days with a break in between if you need it. I have tried many different workout videos and they have never worked for me, they are normally too long and require me doing moves that are just not possible and at a speed that is too fast paced, what I really like about this workout is the fact its only 20 minutes, the moves are not impossible for me, only a few moves are a little of a physical challenge that really push me. I work out for cardio, toning and for my anxiety, I normally would get on my elliptical machine  20 minutes a day I never lost a pound doing it and that's really common, some people work out and work out but never loose a pound, I decided to mix things up and give Jillian a try, the result? To my surprise 4 lbs in 7 days, my thought was how is that even possible? I workout everyday on my elliptical and don't loose a pound, do this for 7 days and pounds are melting away and that wasn't even my intention, but hey trust me I am not complaining at all, its amazing and makes me wonder how is this so different? All I know Is my energy is high, even after the workout, my anxiety is down and this is 100% something I will be doing over and over again, once the 30 days are over I will just start again at the beginning.",1394409600,6,1567,3.8664596273291925

3083983,2,B00127RAJY,"I workout regularly, usually running or biking, but I wanted to add a DVD to my workout to occasionally switch things up. I purchased this DVD because it has fabulous reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred.

The exercise routines on this DVD are moved through very quickly. Generally I like this because I am limited on time and I get bored easily. It is difficult to have good form though with these particular exercises when you are moving through them so quickly. With that being said, it is a DVD and you can pause the DVD.

My least favorite exercises generally including jumping jacks and lunges. I find both of these exercises to be boring, and difficult on my joints and body (despite being a runner). This is basically what this exercise DVD is all about...the exercises I hate. Also, I've done a lot of reading that states such exercises, as well as some of the ab workout to be actually bad for your joints and body and that there are much better alternatives.

Lastly, I have issue with any workout that states I should be doing it everyday without rest. A good trainer with absolutely tell you otherwise. Not to mention if you want results and want to stick to those results and that routine you need to do things the right way and something that you actually enjoy. For me neither of these aspects were met with this DVD.

Overall, I feel there are much better workout DVDs out there than this one. With that being said, you will see results with this DVD if you can actually stick to it and it doesn't hurt your body. For me, I prefer something more enjoyable and less jarring on my body.",1394409600,3,1664,4.5

3084002,5,B00127RAJY,"This DVD is great.  I know many people aren't fans of Jillian, but personalities aside her DVD really does get results.  Initially I followed the workouts like you're supposed to (level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 days, level 3 for 10 days) and only took a day or two off and by the 10th day I really could see results.  By the end I was able to run 3 miles with no hesitation, soreness or problems!

I didn't see much movement in the scale, which was a little disappointing since my reason for working out was to loose weight, but my husband assured me he saw changes within a week and said the reason the scale wasn't moving was because the fat was turning into muscle.

By the end of the 30 days I lost 20 pounds (I watched my diet, too) and may even wear a bikini this summer!  I started with 1 lb weights for the weight training, moved up to 3 lb and now workout with 5 lb weights.  I started the DVD in July, finished in August then did the workouts sporadically over the last few months.

The best part about this DVD is the workouts are no more than 28 minutes including warm up and cool down, so if you are in a pinch for time you can always shorten it or break the workout into sessions to make it even easier.",1393891200,11,1222,4.0625
3084003,4,B00127RAJY,Keeps me going and I can truthfully see results within a short amount if time. Plus it's less than 30 min from warmup to cool down.,1393891200,,131,4.076923076923077
3084004,5,B00127RAJY,"She's direct, easy to follow, no dancey aerobic moves. It's a little easier than her Ripped In 30 Days video.",1393804800,,109,4.5
3084005,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout.  I was doing Insanity and although it was insane, it was also damaging to my shoulders.  Jillian gets in all the stuff plus more that insanity does but doesn't cause injury so you can continue to work out!",1393804800,,230,4.325581395348837
3084006,4,B00127RAJY,Hard but worth it. If you use it correctly you will see the difference. Already a few pounds down. Yay,1393804800,,102,4.15
3084017,1,B00127RAJY,"I thought I'd give her DVDs a try. In my opinion, I don't feel like any of her moves are working for me. I honestly don't even break out in a sweat during these exercises. I think if someone is new to exercising, this might work, but I know of so many other exercises that give you better results than what she is exhibiting in the videos.",1393632000,,339,4.074626865671642
3084018,4,B00127RAJY,This is a complete work out in just 20 min. Still shedding the pounds and toning. It is a great DVD,1393632000,,99,3.761904761904762
3084019,5,B00127RAJY,"I have an athletic body, but have trouble working out in the winter. I have this a try and it has been awesome. I have done 10days of this work out so far and I can feel results. When I started it wasn't easy. There are some exercises that are tough and some that aren't too bad. It's a decent balance, but I know I am working hard. I started level two and it is definitely harder. Level 1 prepared me well though. I really enjoy these work outs. It's great to do regularly and especially on those days where you can't get to the gym or it's not good weather to do something outside. It's 20minutes a workout and I always feel like I worked hard afterwards. Jillian knows her stuff, let her teach you and make your body awesome.",1393632000,,728,4.170212765957447

3084021,2,B00127RAJY,"I love to exercise but I just couldn't get into this.  I like Jillian Michaels but was bored.  Not saying it was easy, but it just didn't flow the way I like to workout.  It may be great for others but I was very disappointed.",1393632000,,226,3.977777777777778
3084022,2,B00127RAJY,"I like the structure of the workout in this video, i.e., 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of core.  It is a very effective workout and pace, and makes the most of 20 minutes.  However, I was really disappointed that there was no low-impact modification available for people who can't jump.  I have always been a fit person, but I can't do high impact  because I have had 2 knee surgeries.  The video starts right off with jumping jacks, and my knees hurt immediately.  Jillian says in the video that she will not give an alternative because she has seen 400 pound people do jumping jacks, so there are no excuses.  There should always be modifications so people don't hurt themselves.  I expected more than jumping jacks and ""no excuses"" from someone who is supposed to be a great trainer.",1393632000,2,813,4.558620689655172
3084023,4,B00127RAJY,"Great workout video, especially for the price! There are 2 of us working out one female and one male. Both of us liked it.",1393545600,,122,4.125
3084024,1,B00127RAJY,"I'm a 25 year old healthy female with no prior knee issues and on day 6 of the 30DS. While I love the workout (it makes me sweat like crazy and helps my endurance), I won't be able to finish out the 30 days because MY KNEES ARE KILLING ME! All 3 workouts consist of nothing but jumping, lunges, butt kicks, and squats. She moves so fast through each step it's impossible to ensure you are achieving the proper form with each move. My 30 year old husband (with prior knee problems) tried one workout with me and couldn't even finish because his knees were in so much pain. I have no doubt I'd be extremely fit by the end of the program, but my knees would be so jacked it wouldn't matter.",1393545600,21,687,4.172932330827067

3084026,3,B00127RAJY,"There are only 3 workouts on the DVD which gets old fast. More annoying however, is the fact that you can't skip to the menu on this DVD. You have to listen to her welcome and explain the program shpeal every time! Overall, Jillian is an okay trainer but I prefer Jackie Warner's DVDs.",1393459200,2,285,4.296296296296297
3084037,5,B00127RAJY,"I absolutely love this workout. I was one of those people who wanted to get in shape but never did, would commit to something for 2 weeks and never do it again. I tried Insanity but it was too high impact for me, but I wanted something that was challenging, allowed me to transition into it and get in shape. I wasn't able to do it 30 days straight, more like 40 days due to my schedule but the results are astounding. I skinny and I always had a belly and a slight muffin top. Those have melted away and my stomach is flat for the first time ever. My legs and arms are toned, and my back is become toned too. I have made this apart of my daily workout routine. I love it. (Do 60 days to look like a superstar lol)",1393459200,,714,3.9652777777777777
3084038,3,B00127RAJY,"I can't really post an accurate review on this because the dvd had a ring around it and it wouldn't play past 51 secs of the Lionsgate intro when you first put it in. I don't know who's fault it was, the manufacturer's or the seller's. I was looking foward to it though because I love Jillian Michaels..... I'm bummed out but too nervous to buy another one and its not worth the shipping fees to send it back.",1393372800,,409,4.189873417721519
3084039,5,B00127RAJY,"I would HIGHLY recommend this video to any one considering it. The first time I worked out to this, I was sore for the next 3 days. You certainly get a good work out in 25 minutes. Love it love it love it!",1393372800,,205,3.7906976744186047
3084040,5,B00127RAJY,This video WORKS! I've been doing it off and on for a while now.  Workout one is still a decent workout :)  It's super great when you don't have time to do anything longer.,1393372800,,172,4.029411764705882

3084045,5,B00127RAJY,"Best workout video!  Only 25 minutes but it kicks your butt!  It usually takes two days for my body to feel soar, but with this video, it is instant.  Can definitely tell it is doing wonders.",1393200000,,191,4.25
3084046,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian is the best. I have worked out all of my life and I love all of her workouts. I especially like 30 Day Shred. You can't go wrong buying any of her workouts really.  I have purchased most of them now and every single one  is very effective, I don't get bored, and my body is in better shape then I have ever been in and I have worked out since I was 12.  Jillian brings it in every one of her workouts and I'm very happy with this DVD. I have No more trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, Yoga Inferno, the 6 week 6 pack. and I'm looking for more.",1393200000,,545,3.8482142857142856

3084058,5,B00127RAJY,"I have been doing this work out for 45 days straight.  I do see a difference in my clothes and my appearance.  Not sure if I actually lost any weight because I have not gotten on a scale yet, but I know I lost inches.  If only I was younger I am sure I would see a much bigger difference.  I like this workout because it is short but very effective.  It is easy to do everyday because it does not take up that much of my day.  I will continue to do it and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a quick workout that will give you results!",1393200000,,541,3.828828828828829

3084064,5,B00127RAJY,I got this dvd as me and a group of friends are doing a 4 week weightloss challenge and as I'm a mom of 2 so the 20 minute intensive workout idea appealed to me as finding time to work out with 2 toddlers is nigh on impossible.  I am a total couch potato lol so this was quite a shock to the system. I am 5ft 8 and started this dvd at 184lb. I am on day 5....haven't weighed in yet so I don't know if I have lost weight but i can tell you that i feel much better about myself. I can feel my body toning up. I honestly see a difference in my body in only a few days.  This dvd will push you. My whole body ACHED for the first couple of days. I honestly don't think there is a part of your body Jillian doesn't work out. I would highly recommend. I think it's a fun challenge...it's only for 30 days...I think I an can do it and if i can do it I think most other beginners could too. Love it!,1393113600,2,890,3.728723404255319

3084077,1,B00127RAJY,"I really like workout videos at home. The instructor can make or break a workout. Jilian does not make me want to workout. She is not motivating, her instruction is poor. Her workout does work, but I had to mute the video to get through it.",1392940800,4,240,4.239130434782608

I am on day 13 and I am always amazed at how quickly I notice my body changing when I use this DVD.
What I like most about the 30 day shred is that it's not too long but it is so effective.  So there are no excuses about not having time to exercise---I'm a mom of 2 and this is a perfect way to workout.",1392940800,,489,3.657142857142857

The obvious CONs is it is repetitive as expected with any excercise DVD so for those who get bored easily you might want to look for something else. I personally don't mind it because each time it doesn't really get any easier for me and she gives you two options to do the beginner or advance version of the workout. The other CON is if you haven't really done a workout class and had someone look if your stance and position are correct or not may hinder and hurt you. So if your not sure about how to do the workout correctly just look it up. Other than that its a great workout DVD for first timers like myself to the Home Workout DVD world.",1392854400,2,894,4.167630057803469
3084082,4,B00127RAJY,I got is to jump start my exercise routine and since I don't have time to workout for one hour a day.  I was wrong since this is a 20 minute workout she kicks my butt.  I thought I was able to do a lot but she makes sure you have very little time between exercises to rest.  She will make you feel good but sore for the next few days.  She throws a lot at you in 20 minutes,1392854400,,373,3.625
3084083,5,B00127RAJY,"This is such a butt-kicking workout. I have worked my way through all three levels but return to this one, adding higher weights. The technique taught through Shred (non-isolated weight training, intervals, etc), easily carries over into the gym. Also... Jillian Michaels.",1392768000,2,272,5.5
3084084,5,B00127RAJY,"This is the first workout video I've bought in YEARS, and thought I'd give it a try because of all the positive reviews - and because I'm a big Jillian fan :) I'm so glad I did!

This is an awesome video that has motivated me to get back into working out after about 7 years off (I'm a mom of 5 kids).  The workouts are tough and challenging, but I really did notice an improvement in my strength and endurance after only a few days.  After having 5 kids, I never thought I'd have the time to get in shape again (!!!), but I can do a 20 minute workout.  My 5 and 7 year olds actually like to try and do the workouts with me :)

I've been doing The Shred for a month now, and am feeling healthier, stronger and more energetic already.  I've lost an inch around my waist, have lost 5 pounds, and am getting more toned - that's without changing my diet at all, and only doing level one 4-5 times/week.  My initial goal was to lose 10 pounds and use this as a precursor to p90x, but I like this so much better than p90x that I've bought a bunch of other Jillian and Biggest Loser workouts to do instead.

Also regarding some of the negative reviews concerning knee injuries:  I have recurring knee pain, and haven't had any problems at all as a result of this video....actually, my knee feels better than it has in a long time.  Jillian emphasizes proper form quite often, so I've just tried to be careful.

Thanks Jillian for the awesome workout!

**Update** 5/20/14
This is by far my favorite workout video.  It's been 4 months now, and I usually do it about 1 to 3x's per week....not as faithfully as I'd like.  (I just got to Level 3 because I wanted to get more comfortable with level 2 before moving on, and level 2 is tough!)  Anyway, not even doing it every day and not changing my eating habits, I've lost 11 pounds and 3 inches around my waist.  I'm sure for those using this 5x's per week and following a healthy eating plan the results would be amazing.
Jillian has really helped me to love working out again!!!

I wasn't expecting measuring myself after a week and going down a whole inch in my waist and up a half inch in my hips (a good thing, since I didn't have any fat there and wanted to gain muscle). I'm so impressed and I can't wait to measure myself after the full 30 days!

I alternate between the levels so it doesn't get boring, and level one is not easy even if you are in shape. Also each level has beginner and advanced versions of the exercises so you have options. I love how Jillian talks through the video, it distracts from the boredom and discomfort I usually feel while exercising. I also love that there aren't a lot of silly aerobic moves. The cardio is jumping jacks, butt kicks, that sort of thing, no dancing.
My only complaint is that there isn't nearly enough stretching at the end. Maybe it's to keep it short, but you need to get a good stretch after this workout.

I would recommend this for beginners....but everyone will be sore who hasn't worked out in a while.,1391990400,,279,4.036363636363636

3084136,5,B00127RAJY,Good combination of exercises.  non stop intense workout.  I would recommend 5 days on 2 days of rest though.  10 days straight is a lot.  your body needs rest.  especially if you are new to exercising.,1391990400,2,202,4.5

We really see a difference in our endurance (neither of us were overweight to start, just wanted to tone up) and feel much more toned after doing this. I love how it's only twenty minutes as it makes it easy to squeeze it in either right before dinner or before bed even. With 3 kids, our time is precious and this work out delivers without consuming too much time.",1391817600,2,446,4.1976744186046515

Jillian is a great teacher and motivator-just when you think you can't possibly do another jumping jack, abdominal move-she talks you into doing two more!!",1391731200,,426,4.448717948717949

However I did have leg, knee joint problems from the workout. For about a good week I was in intense pain & had to ice my knees, doctors said I got bursitis from the workout. But after the swelling went down started the DVD again. I just modified the workouts and left out the lunging & knee motions. The upper body strength training + cardio & abs exercises are great. Would highly recommend.",1391558400,,521,4.067961165048544

I am a 28 year old female and I am normally pretty active as far as walking and biking, but never really did strength training stuff.  I would definirlty consider myself out of shape!  The immense pain after the first workout lasted 2 days and then I finally forced myself to do day 2 of 30 day shred.  Like I said, I just finished day 5 (level 1) and although I definitely still sweat my ass off and feel the burn, I think I am ready to move up to level 2!  I feel good and already notice my pants fitting looser, and someone commented today on how I looked thinner (they had no idea I had started this workout)!! I am only on day 5!!  Can't wait to see the 30 day results.  TIP: after watching it 1 or 2 times I suggest just watching the video and listening to your own music over it, because Jillian's repetitive voice gets annoying and your own music will motivate you even more and get you through the workout!",1391558400,3,1023,4.054726368159204

Of course, I never believe that the ""freshmen 15"" would happen to me, but sadly it did. I now weigh 150 lbs, and I am desperate to lose it. I really want to have more energy, be toned, and just confident with my body.

I have heard fantastic reviews about this video. I must admit I am a little nervous, but so excited to see how things go. I plan to stick to my 1200 calorie/day and do this video 6 times a week. I will give updates on my progress. Hopefully, this helps someone else!",1391472000,,639,3.877862595419847

If you are like me I had to do the slower version for about a week because Jillian is a good trainer but she don't let up. She promised to help you and that is what she intends to do. It does not cost that much and it delivers better than some of the more expensive tapes. I just had to write this review and let everyone know how great this tape is!!! I lost weight in the first week (5lbs)and I was not doing it right the first week, I couldn't. Now I can keep up, I just started to keep up good and I have lost a total of 10lbs in 2 weeks.

There is only about a 10 second pause in between activities to keep your heart rate up.  She breaks down the exercise so you know what to do, and also has two girls behind her - one doing a ""low impact"" version, and the other doing the more advanced version of the exercise.  I would recommend this video to anyone trying to get back into working out.",1391472000,2,501,4.1875

I can't stand jumping jacks, and you do a lot of them in level 1, but I have to say that this program does hit all circuits of a typical workout in a short period of time.  You get cardio, ab work, light weight training, and it bares down on your thighs, butt, and targets all typical problem areas.  I'd give this five stars if I didn't really, really hate jumping jacks :D",1391472000,,503,4.208333333333333

3084164,5,B00127RAJY,"This is an awesome workout DVD if you alternate workouts instead of doing the same one for a week or so and then moving on. The DVD isn't necessarily hard (although if you've never worked out or it's been awhile, it's probably very hard) but you'll pour sweat and burn a crazy amount of calories for twenty minutes.

I don't normally write reviews but I wanted to address the negative ones If you have never used it, you can't accurately comment on the DVD nor should you even be writing a review. If you're knees hurt or there's too much getting up and down for you then you didn't do your homework or are just being a babyand a quiter. As Jillian says, you can't change unless you push yourself so stop making excuses.

If you have bad joints check out Lindsay Brinn's Post Pregnancy DVDs. I know it sounds weird but she gives lots of ""alternative moves"" and adaptations.",1391385600,4,873,4.45

I recently got this as a download for my kindle so I could work out again.  I've gained a lot of weight from medical reasons and I wanted to increase my energy, tone my muscles and lose some weight.  I can't do a full workout at the easiest setting right now, but I do what I can and then increase it a bit every day.",1391299200,2,552,3.773913043478261

Anyway, I got this video because I don't have a lot of time between work and taking care of my kids to exercise but I have enough time for this video. The actual workout is a little over twenty minutes long, with three rotations of exercises working on strength, cardio, and your core. All you need is a set of 3 or 5 pound weights and a yoga/exercise mat and you are all set!! The only reason I gave this four stars is because you can not fast forward through the lengthy introduction and that wastes a lot of time that I don't have.",1391299200,4,699,4.072463768115942

Yes, it is difficult but the movements are slow, precise, and well explained.  No matter how much weight you need to lose, you can do this. Not a bunch of fast crazy movements impossible to understand or keep up. No coordination necessary! At only 30 minutes, and with three levels you can do it for a long time without getting bored. The people who got bored with this are in way better shape than I am. :)",1391212800,2,514,4.298969072164948

Here I am again, I have gained some weight back but I didn't want to go back to the way I was before, so I decided to give it another go. I read how great it worked for a lot of people and I wanted to lose the weight I put back on.

I do weight training 3x a week and cardio 3x a week. Due to the extreme frigid tempatures in my area I needed a workout that 1).  Received great reviews (I have friends who have used it who have raved about it), 2).  Was very short in duration (I do not like workout out at home or with a DVD so I needed something that would keep my attention) and 3).  Was challenging and not boring.  I started with Level 1 and will likely start with Level 2 next week.  I worked out for the first time yesteday morning (1/28/2014) and was huffing and puffing.  This morning I was not caught off guard by the contiual movements and did A LOT better.  Next week I will definitely move onto Level 2.  If I were a DVD person I would probably give it 5 stars and although this is only a 20 minute workout, I just can't do it.  I do enjoy the workouts.  Thanks Jilian.

Don't get me wrong- even if you're in good shape, you'll find this DVD to be a challenge, but it isn't as full-body exhausting as Ripped In 30 or Killer Buns and Thighs. It's definitely a good workout and I enjoy the exercises that Jillian comes up with. Each workout has a beginner modification and an advanced version, so you can work your way up. Even though I've progressed to level 3 and gone on to more strenuous Jillian videos, I still come back to 30 Day Shred at least once a week for a good workout. Although level 1 is the ""easiest"", I follow Jillian's suggestion and add weights to some of the exercises, which makes level 1 just as challenging as level 3.",1390608000,2,827,4.2075471698113205

3084217,5,B00127RAJY,"I use this DVD when I need a kick in the butt to start working out again. I love that it takes 25ish minutes to do and actually gives you results. The first time I did this was about 4-5 months after I had my first child and I'm pretty sure I couldn't walk for days...so be prepared! I recommend this DVD to all of my friends/family members who are just starting to work out.

Tips:
1) Have a lighter set of hand weights around when you first start. It's better to finish with a 2lbs hand weight than not finishing with a 5lbs. Nobody's judging you; you're in your living room. That said...don't forget to increase your weights as you get stronger!
2) Watch your form! There's a lot of lunges/squats/planks and doing them wrong can 1) really hurt you and/or 2) not give you the work out you deserve.
3) Do not do this around things that can fall off of shelves. You'll be doing some jumping around and nothing sucks more than having an entire shelf of pictures fall mid-way through your workout.
4) Switch between the levels!!

Using this work out (and, obviously, eating right), I lost a good 15lbs. I went from a size 6 back to my pre-pregnancy size 2...and I look phenomenal naked. :)",1390435200,6,1187,4.366515837104072
3084218,4,B00127RAJY,"My wife and I got the 30 Day Shred to work out together.  We've enjoyed the workouts, and they always get me going.  However at least with our Samsung BD-C5500 BluRay player, the previews are very hard to skip or fast forward.  We end up waiting 4-5 minutes each time we want to do a 20 minute workout for previews and warnings.  Given we try to do this daily, VERY annoying.  I can't figure out whether this is a function of strict DRM in the Samsung or the way the DVD DRM is published.  Stop-Stop-Play doesn't work, 'disk menu', fast forward, etc all say 'function not available'.  Pushing stop just exits the DVD, and pressing play brings back all the warnings and previews.

Any one else having a similar issue?",1390348800,2,716,4.453846153846154
3084219,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD after a friend recommended it to me and I am so pleased.  Although I am thin I definitely need to tone up, particularly my abs.  I am on my second week and still at level one.  After I finished the first week I felt like I still needed to stay at level one because I was still having a hard time keeping up.  I have two days left at that level and can't believe how much endurance I have gained.  I am so pleased with myself.

One of the greatest things about this workout is how quickly it goes.  I timed it and it is about 26:45 long but it goes so fast. The fact that it is broken down into circuits helps it move quickly. It's one of the best workouts I have found and I've tried quite a few.

One of my goals when starting this workout was to get the ability to do pushups back.  While doing the insanity program I taught myself to do them (having never been able to) but lost it over time.  I'm pleased to say I have it back!

Jillian motivates through her typical tough love.  She offers modified versions for most exercises but not all.  For example, she doesn't allow for modified jumping jacks saying she has 400 pound people who can do them.  Having said that she does not make you feel bad if you need to catch your breath but says to take no more than 5 seconds to do it.

One downside is Jillian's personality, she is pretty dry and monotone.  I usually have music going and turn the volume on the TV down to the point where I can hear it just enough to know what I need to be doing.  Her lack of personality is not enough to make me change my mind on how much I love to workout.

This is a great workout for beginners as well as the advanced. You will definitely find thst you are sweating and pushing yourself. If you are questioning making the purchase at all, question no more, DO IT!  You won't be disappointed.",1390348800,,1848,4.0974930362116995

3084221,4,B00127RAJY,"I already had Ripped in 30, and I like Jillian's 3-2-1 system so I got 30 Day Shred too. It's an enjoyable program that ups the variety, but you can tell it's the earlier version. It's not formatted exactly right for today's widescreen tv's (all the girls look a little wide, which I find oddly comforting) and some of the moves are a little dated. Ripped in 30 definitely is more modern, with better music and an extra workout. But 30 Day Shred is worth it. These workouts are tough. I have done a lot of extreme-style TV workouts like P90X and I still find Jillian's workouts to be very challenging. I also like that they are done in under a half hour from warm up to cool down.

I just bought this it caught my eye because I thought I can exercise for at least 20 minutes a day. I just did the work out. Wow level 1 iam able to do.

At 5'8"" and 137lb, I'm only looking to lose a couple pounds including the pooch that I gained after having a baby 4 months ago.  I don't have the freedom of going to the gym right now & the baby isn't old enough to be in the jogger stroller so a good home work out DVD is a must to get back on track.  I can not say enough good things about this workout!  It's 30 min long, which is honestly the perfect length because who can't squeeze in a 30 min sweat session?  I find Jillian really motivating and I love her on The Biggest Loser.  She makes a really good point by stating if you want results you need to work for them...it's as simple as that.  So when I'm starting to half ass it as my thighs are burning during lunges, I find myself able to push through know that the end of the workout isn't far and I AM going to see results!  I'm on Level 1 and sore in all the right places, thighs, butt, lower abs, chest and biceps. It feels so good to have time for myself to work up an effective sweat and not have to drive to the gym to feel like I got a good workout in.
You need a good cushioned workout mat if your on a hardwood floor like me. Also, a set of hand weights. I started with 3lbs but found it wasn't challenging enough &  i love working my arms and shoulders so I upped it to 8lbs. That and 30 min and you are all set!  Good luck!!

3084256,4,B00127RAJY,"This is a tough workout. I don't get very sweaty, but I do get out of breath. I am a fairly fit, fairly thin female (5'5"" currently 135 lbs) that hasn't exercised in a while so I wanted to get back into it without joining a gym. I use 5 lb. hand weights with this DVD but think that may be too heavy for starting out for certain moves.
The video consists of three circuits. You do 3 minutes of weights, 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, running in place, ""jumping rope"" movements etc.) and then 1 minute of abs. Then you repeat that 2 more times (for a total of three times) during workout 1. (Not ready for the other levels of workout).
After 2 days straight of this video, my calves are very sore (feel like I've been running), my chest and my triceps/biceps arms are also sore. I don't really feel any pain in my abs though, but I can do a lot of crunches before the video, so I don't really think the 1 minute of abs is enough for me.
Good video, will leave you sore the next day. I am going to keep it up and see if it helps me lose any weight. It is hard to do more than one day in a row though because of how tough it is. It is almost impossible to do ALL of the moves for as many reps as they do.",1389657600,,1206,3.9065040650406506

3084259,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm going to be honest, I don't like working out and I never have. I do it because I want to lose weight. I started because I got fed up with looking in the mirror and wishing I was thinner. I started with this DVD workout and all I can say is: It Works! I saw results after just one week and so did my husband. Seeing the results made me even more motivated and while it isn't always easy, it is definitely something that I was able to push myself through, and if I can do it, so can you!

Here are some specifics about the workout.

** You will need a mat (if on a hardwood floor) and some hand weights (I bought mine here on Amazon: ""j/fit Dumbbell Set with Stand"" It's a 32 pound set and perfect for Jillian Michaels workouts).

** The workout itself is only 20 minutes, but she does a warm-up before the workout begins and a cool-down after the workout is over, both of these are about 5 minutes each, making this whole workout (including warm-up and cool-down) close to 30 minutes long.

** There are 3 levels. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Each level gets more difficult as you progress. You are supposed to do each level for 10 days which means that you do Level 1 for 10 days, Level 2 for 10 days and Level 3 for 10 days until you reach the full 30 days (hence 30 day shred).

** Her workouts are are a mix of cardio and strength. You will be doing things like push-ups, jumping jacks and even a little bit of kickboxing. It's a good workout and it will definitely make you sweat.

** She does not allow any breaks, because the workout is only 20 minutes long and the main goal is for your body to change as fast as possible in order to see results in those 30 days.

** She does allow and show ways to modify exercises like push-ups for example. So don't worry about not being able to keep up 100% right away, you'll eventually get there.

Her workouts are tough (I own some of her other dvd's as well), but I am motivated to lose that weight so I can take w/e she throws my way. Please don't ever think that you can't do it or make up excuses of why you can't start today or why you should wait... I was there and I said enough is enough, today is as good as any other day. Push yourself and you will see that you are able to do this. There is nothing holding you back besides yourself. So go find that that motivation and hold on to it, push through, and you will see results!  Good Luck :)",1389657600,28,2402,4.061310782241015

Day two was the hardest for me (intensely worn out and sore) and wondered if I would actually get better and improve but low and behold - she was right!  It happened.  My body adapted!  Just started level two (which is apparently level I on steroids) and am psyched to keep on feeling the improvement that I can NOW truly believe is soon to come (soon to come after workouts that are not for the faint of heart!

Note: I did not lose any more weight, but my body looked like I had lost at least 10!

I fell off with my workouts during the last half of the year and decided to start 2014 right with Jillian again! This time around I am watching my eating and incorporating another of her videos. I am looking forward to reaching my goals this year and losing not only inches, but weight this time around!",1389398400,5,663,4.28

3084278,5,B00127RAJY,"I mean I seriously read the 1 and 2 star reviews on this and I am not sure how those reviews are even possible. This program is great and as a beginner working out from home I wanted something that was not too hard but something that could push and challenge me as a guy. After having been told by my dr. that I am in fact overweight for a person of my age and that I can get diabetes like a lot of people in my family I decided to take my health seriously. With this program I have managed to lose 25 lbs in just a month and a half of using it.

Was it a push and a struggle for a beginner like me? Yes it was but as Jillian said in the DVD you cannot expect to get results without the push. I mustered through the workouts and before I knew it the weight was starting to come off like nothing. Being a big fan of the biggest loser myself I said if those people can lose hundreds of lbs on the show then I have no doubt I could reach my goals too even if it's not as big of goals as the people on that show. Bottom line I am recommending this program because it works. For me as a beginner it worked and still works. If you are more advanced then maybe this program might not be the right one for you but for me it was simply amazing I give you that.",1389312000,15,1251,3.8115384615384613

You have to stick with it to stay in shape and keep the weight off, which is what I should have done. Also, I would like to add that with level 1 ALONE I lost the weight. Levels 2 and 3 are freakin' impossible (for me)! I got through about 5 minutes of level 2 and was dead. Lol. So I give it 4 stars for giving results, even though I didn't get through all levels.

3084314,4,B00127RAJY,"I would say that this one is a good DVD. There are essentially three different workout levels which you're supposed to do for 10 days each, though you can do any of them for more or less time depending on your fitness level. I will admit that I've only ever done levels 1 and 2, and haven't made my way to the end of the 30 days. My biggest issue is that I get bored; these aren't my favorite types of exercises and I don't really have ""fun"" doing them so I end up moving to a different DVD once I can't face this one any more. I will say that the exercises are great to get you moving, and they actually do get easier as you work through the 30 days. I also really like the warm up/cool down portions; I often forget to do these when exercising on my own so it's a nice reminder. Overall, I would say that if Jillian doesn't bug you (I like her, though I know I'm a minority) than give this one a shot!",1388793600,,903,3.967032967032967

3084316,2,B00127RAJY,"Those that watch Jillian know she can be tough. Pain is gain but as a beginner can be really destructive.

3084318,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels scares me.  I was turned off right away to this DVD because of her reputation.  Yes, I want to work out and lose weight, but I don't want to be beat down and terrified while I do it. :)

I've always dieted on and off and this new year was no different.  Well, except one thing.  I'm getting older and the weight is having a harder time coming off.  I hate doing this kind of exercise and prefer to just go to something active and fun, but it's just not enough anymore.  I tried Zumba, but nearly died from too much cardio.  Not to mention that I felt like I had two left feet trying to learn the moves.  This video is very doable for the clutzy.

So you start with a little stretch, then you do 3-2-1.  3 Minutes of strength training with the little dumbbells.  2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs which are on the floor so you will need a mat.

Just when you are near death, she stops and moves on to something else.  there are 3 or 4 of the 3-2-1- circuits and you're done.  One more cool down stretch and you have had a kick butt workout in less than 25 minutes.  I mean you can't beat that and it makes it hard for you to come up with an excuse because it IS so short.

I'm only on week 1, so I can't vouch for the other weeks, but so far so good.  I think this is the least boring work \out tape I've ever done.  To be fair, I haven't done many because I hate working out, but this one is different.  I really suggest giving it a try.  You can't go wrong for the price!  I'm in terrible shame.  My wii fit shot me up to the 'obese' category when it weighed me.  I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was THAT bad.  Even so, I was able to get through the workout.  I think this DVD is a great fit for the beginner exerciser and the super stars.

And finally, I am no longer scared of Jillian.  I actually find her very helpful during the video, a great coach and kinda of funny!  Who would have thought?",1388620800,,1930,3.9402597402597404

3084320,5,B00127RAJY,"My wife lost 18 pounds !

After her pregnancy she was so busy with our new baby that she didn't have time to go to the gym or even leave the house much. Many months were passing by and we were almost certain she was gonna keep on most of the weight. She had never really tried these home video workouts and didn't know if it would work for her but as it turns out, it works great ! As her husband, I am surprised and as excited as she is about her results.

Because each of the videos are approx. 20-25 minutes long, as soon as she puts our baby to sleep for the morning nap, she starts the video right away and is done before she knows it, well before our daughter wakes up. Fortunately the DVD, as many people have mentioned, is broken into 3 levels and so she was able to gradually get up to the more intense workout.

Tips from my wife: To get the most out of those 25 minutes, you really need to give it your best effort and intensity during that time knowing that it will be over soon. People are probably getting variable results because of the different effort they put into it. Jillian gives good encouragement during the workout to keep you going. Also, my wife was not on any special diet, just reducing her carbohydrate intake in general with more protein instead (ie. turkey/chicken/tuna), and eating smaller portions. If she craved chocolate, she didn't completely inhibit herself from it but would just take a small piece (all in moderation to keep sanity and motivation). Don't get discouraged the first few days and be persistent. The truth is my wife did this 6 days/week one day off to relax and enjoy life.

Summary: This is a wonderful discovery that gave my wife great results and a lot of energy at a time when she was extremely emotional and down about her weight. She was persistent and gave it her best shot and she lost 18 Lbs so far ! She looks so different, especially when we look at her ""before photo"" (recommend you take a before photo, its encouraging !). I imagine a lot of others like my wife can potentially lose quite a bit of weight if they work hard at it, be persistent, and eat better! Yes we definitely recommend this workout ! At this point, rather than searching for a new workout, my wife is just going to repeat this workout to reach her ultimate goal.

My wife and I both hope you find this review helpful in your search !

Well, Jillian kept me motivated throughout the whole workout - even knew when I was ready to quit for the day and told me to stick with it.  So now we spend each morning together for some butt kicking time!!!",1388620800,,341,4.380952380952381

I use this one and the Trouble Zones one by Jillian all the time. I use the Trouble Zones one mostly everytime I exercize (2 days/wk) which I would rank number one because it has alot more exercises and is longer than the 30 day shred. It also targets back of the arms, butt, & other areas better. I don't get sick of it of either of these two dvds. I enjoy both of them & know I'm going to get a good overall workout. Easy to do also. I like Jullian's knowelede, confidence, humor, and careing additude in the videos also.",1388448000,,649,4.038759689922481

3084346,5,B00127RAJY,The workout is short enough that  you will not suffer for long and not so hard that with adjustments along the way you cannot complete it.  It is definitely a great addition to a workout regimen.

Jillian is great and the workouts are very challenging, but not too challenging. Surprisingly, level 3 is my favorite and the most fun. I found level 2 to be the hardest. All in all, I'm sure I'll be using this workout for years to come.",1388361600,,382,4.319444444444445
3084349,5,B00127RAJY,"Just downloaded this on my Smart TV. VERY effective workout, and I will add this into my rotation of exercise videos. The workout is a smart combo of strength, cardio and ab training. Jillian uses a 3-2-1 method.. 3 min Strength, 2 min Cardio, 1 min Abs. Everything in my body feels a little tight and worked out.  Thanks Jill for your tough love & commitment to results!!",1388361600,,372,4.470588235294118
3084350,5,B00127RAJY,It was a gift for someone so I have not used it.  The person that it was for was looking forward to using it,1388361600,,108,3.5
3084351,5,B00127RAJY,"This was recommended to me by a nutritionist and I just love this DVD. There are 3 workouts that are all 30 minutes. That's the most I time I have for a workout. The warm up and cool down is mostly the same between the workouts, but each workout is progressively more challenging. The workouts work multiple muscle groups at the same time and attack the abs nicely. I always notice my body get firm (esp my abs) when I'm consistent with this work out. They follow a 3-2-1 format: 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs. Usually each segment alternates between two exercises, so you don't get bored. I tend to alternate between the workouts--I get too bored if I do the same workout in a row.

My only critique is that Jillian mentions a couple of times that it's a 20 minute workout, which annoys me when I'm sweating my butt off because it's 30 minutes. Maybe without the warm up/cool down it's not 30 minutes, but still it takes me 30 minutes to complete. I know, silly, but it does annoy me. If she had a 20 minute DVD I'd probably try it.

If you like this, ""Ripped in 30"" is similar to this video except there are 4 30 minute workouts. I like this one better for some reason, but that one is very good, too.",1388275200,2,1233,4.242553191489361
3084352,2,B00127RAJY,"This came with high recommendations for my cheap-skate self who won't fork out the cash for a gym membership in the winter. I've got some knee issues so normally have to modify the program. There really are no modifications you can do with this one (she'll tell you that herself then belittle you because, ""I have 400 pound clients who can do this!""). I tried the program for 2 weeks and my body never really ""adjusted"" as she said it would I was just constantly in pain. Plus, she's difficult to listen to on the video. There was no good way to mute her without knowing the program better.

Overall I was not impressed. I've got the P90 and P90X workouts and like those much better. They are more diverse and the P90 is easier to modify if you have any orthopedic issues.",1388275200,4,772,4.398601398601398
3084353,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this years ago.  I used it, years ago.  I liked it, years ago.  I put it down and got involved with other things.  I picked it back up in the last couple of weeks and I still love it.

The trick?  The exercises never get easier.  As they get easier, you just do more with better form and more weight.  You do levels 1 and 2 consecutively.  You do all 3 consecutively.  Whatever you do, all or one or two,  you still have a good workout done in less than an hour - saves time over going to the gym.",1388275200,,506,3.8627450980392157
3084354,5,B00127RAJY,"This is JM at her very best.  This routine really kicks my rear.  What I particularly love about JM 30DS is that Jillian is clear, gives good instruction, provides excellent transition between moves (if you've seen workouts that do this poorly, you know exactly what I mean) and her motivational commands are awesome.  As to the later, her motivational commands, if you were just sitting and watching this, you may think they're corny or something.  The fact that I'm commenting on them probably means I did at first.  But when you've really been pushing it and you're burning, she kicks in and demands that you push through it.  There is something about her timing, tone and rhythm that really works.  It is certainly not by accident.

The only con is that you have to watch the studio sales pitch every time you put the DVD in the player.  You can't skip though it.  I find this very annoying but it is certainly not JM's fault.

My wish list for this and all workout videos is I wish you could choose an audio option that allows you to listen to only the trainer's instructions without music so that I can crank my music while working out but not miss the important instructions from the trainer.

If you are in horrible shape and just getting back into it like I was a year ago or more intermediate as I think I am now, spend the 8 or 9 bucks this DVD costs.  It is so worth it.  If you are more advanced, I think this still would be a nice complement to your workout repertoire.",1388275200,,1483,4.384615384615385

I'm already at my recommended body weight, so I did not lose any additional weight.  However, I lost 1.75 inches around my waist and about 0.5 inches on each arm.  Even better, I went from being able to do 7 ""girl"" push-ups to being able to do 30 ""man"" push-ups.  I looked better and felt great!  The levels changed at exactly the right time.

You can pick different routines to do and she has a low impact version if you aren't quite ready  to go all out.  I can definitely see a difference in my body after only a few weeks.

3084369,5,B00127RAJY,"I like this video because it uses simple moves like jumping jacks and squats. There are a bunch of simple moves, that don't take a lot of brain power to learn, because you did them all in gym class. Jillian also takes the time to tell you what you are doing and why. This is really important if you want to break away from the video and work out on your own, to your own music. Also, if you have an injury, you learn how to sub in one move for another to match the required intensity to get the full effect.

3084371,4,B00127RAJY,"As someone who has always worked out by going for rambling walks and the occasional run, I wasn't sure what I needed to boost my workout. I came online in search of a video that I could do in the privacy of my own home without looking like an idiot in front of everyone. Based on all the great reviews, I decided to try the 30 Day Shred. I haven't been able to finish it because I got an injury in an unrelated activity but I'm chomping at the bit to get back. Sure, it's hard and yes, you'll sweat all over the place but man is this video great.

I thought it looked really easy but it keeps you going. I love the circuitry, it feels like it keeps everything fresh and oh my gosh -- how does Jillian know me? Just when I'm about to lay down on the floor and take a rest she calls out like a beacon in the night to hop back up and get with the program.

I would totally recommend this video to anyone who's looking to lose but be warned, losing weight and toning up doesn't happen with you prancing around the living room for 20 minutes. It takes real work, real dedication and drive. You can do it!",1388016000,2,1099,4.036697247706422

It sucks while you're doing it, I kinda feel like I'm going to die, but I saw results FAST. And since its only 20 minutes, I have no excuse not to do it. She recommends doing this two days in a row, then one day of just cardio, then two days of the video, then a rest day. The first level sucked (I do not like push ups) but the second level is great.

3084390,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD at the recommendation by my sisters.  It collected dust on the shelf for several months before I ever even opened it.  I have been a gym devotee for the past 14 years, and thought that working out at home was dumb and pointless.  And duh, how was I supposed to really get a good workout in in 20 minutes?

Then I actually OPENED the DVD and tried it a few months ago.  Wow, it was not what I expected at all!  I literally felt tired and exhausted after 20 minutes.  I loved it!  I didn't follow the standard progression of doing each one for several days, then moving up.  I go back and forth with the workouts to prevent boredom.  I also modify them a little if some of the jumps are bothering my knees, or if I feel that a sequence isn't challenging enough.  I don't know if I lost any weight from the workouts, I am already a thin/athletic build and wasn't really needing to lose weight. However, I DEFINITELY look more toned, and I am a lot stronger!  Jillian has changed the way I think about working out, and has changed the way I work out even when I'm at the gym.  No more ""phoning it in.""  =)

I do have a few issues with the workouts. First, the warm ups are not long enough at all. I generally warm up on my own for a few minutes before starting the DVD. Also, I wish the workouts were a bit longer, at least 30 minutes.  However, I am aware that Jillian designed these DVDs for people who are busy and have difficulty finding time to exercise. Sometimes I will do one of the workouts, then part of another.  Also, the plyometric (jump) training seems like it is pretty hard on the joints.  I have a semi-bad knee, and some days it hurts and I need to modify the workouts.  Or I just do Yoga Meltdown. But all in all, I am thoroughly impressed!  I have bought two more of Jillian's DVDs and now only go to the gym about once a week.  Jillian kicks my butt the other days!",1387411200,,1900,4.136612021857924

I now realize I should have eased into it. She makes you do SO SO many squats that I developed problems with my IT band. I am 30, a runner and hiker, am not overweight (125 lbs) and never had these problems before. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone...my body must be predisposed. A word of warning--BE CAREFUL!--if you start hurting stop immediately! My knees started giving out when I would squat to pick something up and the stairs were a huge problem for me. I think the repetitive movements in the video caused inflammation and rather than stopping and letting them calm down, I kept pushing myself and it resulted in injury.",1387324800,,791,4.5

Many people seem to be having a problem with having to watch the previews. Im not sure why but I haven't watched them since the first day and im on day 5. I just stick it in and goes straight to the main menu. This might be bc I watch it on my Xbox?

Another reviewer said this cant be watched in thr US. Totally not true. Im in the US. Im on day 5. Everything is great.

Now on to the product - It is the real deal. There are 3 different levels. I have been working out a few months now and thought level 1 was gonna be a breeze. Not! I found myself seriously struggling to keep up. I had to talk myself to it. Im still on level 1. I don't feel like im ready to go to level 2 just yet. Honestly kinda scared to lol.

These 3 workouts are great for days you don't have time or are just not that into working out, so that you are still killing calories. I rotate these smaller workouts w/ some of her extended dvds to keep it interesting and to work different body groups. I have been on a ""Jillian"" dvd rotation(30 min shred, metabolism boost, 6 week abs, advanced shred) for about a month and I feel great and I am super toned and feel strong. I can see definition in my body but I cant' really say that I have lost weight but I think that has more to do w/ my diet.  My only warning is that if you tend to build leg muscle and booty muscle quickly beware because w/ all the jumping and squats and burpies in her video circuits your legs and booty will be pumped up!

This video goes in six minute circuits: 3 minutes of strength training, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, followed by 1 minute of core work. Just when you feel like dying, you move on to something new and you can breathe again. The only thing I would say to watch out for is if you have bad knees.

Because the workout is so short you can't ""phone-it-in"". The way that the strength, cardio and abs are broken up is nice because your muscles get (a very short amount of) rest in between. The warm-up is great. During the cool down I generally do additional stretching because it goes a little fast. The last level is very challenging, don't get discouraged the first few times you do it. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is level 3. Level 3 is a bit hard on the joints (especially knees). I do modifications so my knees aren't so sore.

3084485,1,B00127RAJY,"Wow, not sure how this received so many 5 star reviews! The techniques she uses are NOT good for the knees and back! I have tried just about every workout dvd there is and am a big runner, but I have NEVER had knee pain until I did this BEGINNER section. The butt kicks and reverse squats as cardio and other moves in other sections are so bad for the knees.

I had pain climbing stairs for almost a week after doing the beginner workout ONCE!

To be fair, I did read reviews about knee pain, but I figured they must be inexperienced or overweight. I weigh 130 after having had a baby 8 mos ago and saw this recommended on several baby/pregnancy sites which is pretty scary since abs and back muscles are not able to support you doing these twisting and jumping moves. I can go out and run 5 miles with no problem and do any of my other workout DVDs but this one gives me knee and back pain.

I tried the other levels too and it doesn't get better. This one's going in the trash.

And the continuous weights instead of just a set at a time is tough.  Again, I'm loving it.  And I love that it's only 20 minutes.

3084493,4,B00127RAJY,"I bought this dvd a couple years ago and I keep returning to it whenever the weather gets cooler and I need to workout indoors. I personally do not like Jillian's personality; I find her egotistic and annoying. So, I am amazed that I actually like her exercise dvds. I think it is the 3-2-1 that I like; each circuit is a limited time and she breaks it up with different exercises that I am able to complete. In fact, her dvds are the only ones that I use repeatedly. I like the exercises so much that I am able to overlook her personality traits and focus on the workout.

Unlike some reviewers, I like that Jillian does not do all the exercises herself. One thing I find irritating on some videos is when the instructor is huffing and puffing while trying to tell how to do the exercises. I wish more instruction would be given on proper form. Once I became familiar with the exercises, I looked up how to do them properly. As for pacing, I do not try to keep up with the pace on the video and prefer to go at my own pace so I can pay attention to the proper form so I do not injure myself.

One thing I have difficulty with are the number of exercises requiring the plank position. I injured my wrist and am unable to hold that position.  Several reviews mentioned issues with their knees, but mine is my wrist. Level 1 is manageable but level 2 is too painful. But then, this is a dvd that I am working out to it on my own and I need to use my own judgment as to what I can or cannot do. This is why I am giving a 4 star rather than a 3 star review. In addition, it is also why I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 because when she says that she a 400+ pound people able to do jumping jacks and therefore there is no reason why you [whoever is listening] cannot do jumping jacks.  I find that remark to be irresponsible for a trainer to be giving. (This is my opinion because everyone has different needs and circumstances. Just because some one can do something that does not set the standard for me being able to accomplish that same task.)

I have to say that level one of the 30 day shred is one of my favorite routines and I often use it as a warmup before I go for my run.",1384560000,,2179,4.046403712296984

3084500,5,B00127RAJY,It's my first DVD with Jillian Michaels. It's very challenging and shapes up your body. After each exercice I really feel that my entire body works hard. I did not use to exercice so at first I was very very sore. This DVD is very effective and after 1 month I feel that my body has shaped up. Only after 3 weeks I started the level 2 and it was very challenging. I believe level one is still challenging whenever I want to switch back to it. Not yet up to level 3. But the results are so motivating and it feels so good at the end of each workout that although it is challenging I keep doing it every day. Really worth a try.,1384214400,,626,4.016
3084501,5,B00127RAJY,"This is an amazing workout.  I started seeing results in 2 weeks!!  I have done Insanity and Turbo Jam.  This is just as good, 1/10th the price and only 20 minutes.  When I did Insanity, I could barely move some days after working out.  Not so with this workout.  It is challenging but not so challenging that you can't get it done.  I can't wait to try more of her workouts!!",1384214400,,376,4.211267605633803
3084502,5,B00127RAJY,"And I've tried many. I'm one of those ""have 10-15 pounds to lose"" types which can be very hard to overcome that last set of pounds. (I've lost 9 so far.) Now, it's not solely due to this video.... I drastically changed my eating habits to higher protein / lower glycemic carbs only. Not low carb but only good carbs that don't spike blood sugar. This is actually what Jillian and many others suggest and I've seen it work in my own weight loss. (I got one of her cookbooks and one of the Biggest Loser cookbooks to help). I started this video about 2 1/2 weeks after I began to exercise every day with a variety of videos. But this hard workout really makes you feel like you are making best use of your time. If you are pressed for time, do this video! I have an elliptical and the way I feel at the end of this video doesn't compare! It's so much harder and a much more efficient use of my time exercising.

I'm on day 11 / level 2 now. (No, I did not do them 11 days in a row like some think she tells us to do.) I did about 2 in a row, then 1 day of something else like Yoga, then repeat, then day off to fill out the week.  I had already lost some weight before I started this video, but have lost more since and I've seen a huge improvement in inches lost around abs / waist, which was my biggest problem area, since I started this and lowered my body fat percentage. And my endurance has really improved.  But I haven't lost much in my legs and think Level 1 wasn't quite hard enough on legs but level 2 feels like it does more with legs.

I did level 1 all 10 days. I gradually increased the weight where I could, normally using 5 or 8. I wish I had started with 3 b/c I was WAY sore after the first workout. But after that one, I had no trouble continuing each day.  (Anyone else think the first cycle of strength on level 1 is the hardest of them all? Yikes! It was still way hard on my 10th day!)

The abs are a little too easy on Level 1 but improve on Level 2. So you may want to plan a little extra exercise on your own if that is a trouble area.

Just know though this is not 20 minutes. Plan for 30. Each video is about 27 ish minutes. I think she doesn't calculate the warm up or cool down when she says give her 20 minutes a day. But it's 20 minutes of the hard core stuff. Consider this video if you want to work hard in a short amount of time.

UPDATED:
I just have one day left of 30 day shred. It took me about 7 weeks to get through it. Ave. about 4x per week on the shred video and 2 days doing something else.

When I finished the 10 days of level 1 it still felt hard to me. But after mostly finishing level 3 when I took a lighter day to do 1 after a hike made my legs sore, level 1 was easy. It showed me how much better shape I am in cycling through the program. I've never experienced big results like this before with any other video or program.

From the 2nd week of Oct til now (mid Dec.) I've lost most of the weight I set out to lose and a lot of that is body fat.

I just have one suggestion on Level 3. The hardest move is when she wants you in a plank with weights under your hands to lift. But with all of your body weight on one hand at a time, it hurts too much b/c weights are too hard even with neoprene covers. I tried the same move without weights and still felt like my arms were getting a great workout (because they take turns holding a lot of your body weight.)

My legs got much more muscular after getting into Level 2-3 and abs workouts are much better than 1. I had mentioned 1 wasn't enough on the legs or abs. That gets fixed with 2-3. I was able to do an extremely difficult hike up a mountain at the 2/3rds part of this program. I could never have done it without having gotten in shape through this video first. I've lost over 3"" around my waist/abs area. And 13 pounds total loss.",1384128000,3,3839,3.945736434108527

3084504,5,B00127RAJY,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DVD!  Okay, so I started a diet and exercise program back in March of this year as I had 50 pounds to lose.  I started running 1-2 miles 5 days a week and now run 3-4 miles 5 days a week.  I lost my first 40 pounds but have been unable to lose the last 10 (very stubborn) pounds.  I have watched and maintained a healthy diet, quit all my soda, candy and crap and have really stuck to it, so it was upsetting that I could not get this last 10 pounds off.  I searched the web thinking I needed to do more than just cardio and came across Jillian Michaels 30 day shred. I thought, wow only 20 minutes a day? I can do this. Well let me tell you. I burned just as many caloriesa with the 20 minute workout as I do running 2.5 miles.  And, I thought I was in pretty good shape and when I do the workouts, I can feel muscles I didn't even know I had.  If anyone is considering buying this DVD, you totally should. Definitely has made a difference. My abs, back and thighs are getting toned, and I feel great.

There are a few reviews that say Jillian is annoying or you get bored with doing each of the 3 levels for 10 days.  I have not been bored.  The time flies by and I have so much energy.  I can't wait to purchase another one of her dvds.  Great buy!",1383868800,4,1273,3.9105058365758754

3084509,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for something to help me get started on my journey to losing my I'm-having-a-baby-so-I-can-eat-anything-I-want weight, about 45 pounds of it. I prefer yoga but I know I'm going to need more than that to get this weight off, and I need something quick that I can do while my kids nap and still have time to switch out loads of laundry, pay bills, etc. I also haven't had a proper workout since before I had my first child, almost 2 1/2 years ago, so I knew any workout I attempted would be difficult, so why not just take the plunge?

Today was day one, so this review is based on first impressions.
When the DVD starts Jillian tells you she is very tough. This is not an understatement. I began on level 1, doing the modified poses for beginners and using no weights. She starts with a quick warm up, but I am so out of shape that I was already starting to feel that burn start by the end of the WARM UP!
At 5 minutes in to the workout I was cussing her. At 10 minutes I started to fall off pace, simply unable to jump every now and then, needing a quick rest here and there. Around 15 minutes I knew I was close to the end but my body was just saying no, my wobbly legs would not lift me off the ground for jumping. Then Jillian said something like she knows you want to quit and just turn the DVD off right now, but the end is where you do the most good and to just keep pushing. I couldn't believe it but her words really helped me when I was about to stop. I pushed harder and felt a burst of strength come through my body and I finished the workout! She really did motivate me then, and she has a lot of the same talk through-out. I really enjoyed her tough-love approach.

So how was it? Awful. Do I want to do it tomorrow? Yes!
After the cool down I sat on the couch for a couple minutes and then got up to get some more water, thinking my legs felt pretty good. Walking back to the couch my legs felt like they might give out. The burn lasted long after the workout. I expect that my muscles will feel like they've been put through the grinder tomorrow, but I also know that if I keep pushing myself through this workout (and stick to my diet) that I will start seeing results in no time.",1383782400,7,2236,4.079545454545454
3084510,5,B00127RAJY,"This totally works!! Best workout tool I ever bought. She is great at explaining everything, including ways to do various moves either more intense or a little more easliy depending on your body strength.",1383782400,,204,5.029411764705882
3084511,5,B00127RAJY,This is a really great workout that doesnt take a lot of time. I tend to get really bored with workouts that are long but this one is short and effective which is exactly what Im looking for as someone who works full time and has a family!,1383696000,,239,4.0
3084512,5,B00127RAJY,Great workout in only 25 minutes! The different levels are challenging and the 3 2 1 interval training principle gets results. Nice to have both beginner and more advanced moves to choose from.,1383696000,,193,4.878787878787879
3084513,4,B00127RAJY,"I like this DVD a lot! After the first day, I was so sore, but I pushed through and feel great. I'm a mom with 2 kids, my oldest is 2 and the baby is 7 months. No way do I have time to hit the gym every day, but this is short enough that I can fit it in while the baby sleeps and my oldest watches an episode of Little Einsteins. After 4 days on level 1, I wasn't quite feeling as satisfied after the work out, so I upped to level 2. Loved it. I don't feel like I've lost weight or inches, but I FEEL better, and that's the important thing to me.

Update:
I put this tape away for a while. Ok, really, for about a year and a half. When I wrote this review originally, my son was 7 months old. Well, he just turned 2, and I decided it was time to start working out again. I eat fairly well, and with my diet alone, I tend to hover around the same weight. I don't gain, but I definitely don't lose either. I started this work out again one week ago, determined to make it through the whole 30 days. I didn't modify my intake, just started adding the work out. In 1 week, I will admit that I haven't lost any weight. In fact, I gained a pound. But! I'm so excited to announce that I've lost 1 inch off of my hips and thighs. I'm still on level 1. My goal is to do level 1 for 10 days, then level 2 for 10, level 3 for 10. Im really happy to be losing some stubborn inches of post-baby weight, and I can't wait to see the results after 23 more days!",1383609600,,1445,3.8006644518272426
3084514,4,B00127RAJY,I like this work out but I haven't used it much as I received my T25 workout videos right after receiving this.  LOVE the Focus T25!,1383609600,,132,4.076923076923077
3084515,2,B00127RAJY,"I can only say two good things about this video and they're both kind of the same thing:

1. It is challenging
2. It is probably effective

I have been physically active my entire life.  My parents had me in dance lessons by the time I was 2-years-old.  I danced past high school and remained active afterward.  I am now 30-years-old.  I am no stranger to working out.  I know the importance of reps and strength training combined with aerobics but COME ON!  This video, while challenging, is pretty much like my high school gym classes.

Jumping jacks.
Push-ups.
Fake jump roping.
Crunches.

It lacks character and variety as the same movements are used over and over.  I get so bored I can hardly stand it.  When you are working out and having fun, you don't think so much about how you feel tired or your muscles are sore but with this work out, you feel every. last. rep. because you are SO bored!  I put it away for a year.  This morning, I thought I'd give it another try to make sure I really didn't like it.  Yep.  I popped it into the DVD player and walked away about 8 minutes later.

I have never seen 'The Biggest Loser' so I was not familiar with Jillian Michaels' style before I bought this DVD.  She will begin a movement and do maybe 2 or 3 reps and then stand up and start walking around the room, calling her models ""Buddy.""  It's weird.  I get the sense that even Jillian Michaels is bored out of her mind.

If this is your style, then by all means, you'll be happy and I'm sure you'll see results.  If you are used to variety in your workouts - if you like to have fun and learn new things, this isn't your video.  Just do jumping jacks, crunches and push-ups on your own and save yourself 9 bucks plus shipping",1383523200,4,1731,4.258461538461538

But I got my 6-pack abs pack within a short time -- not 30 days, more like 90 -- but I really gained an appreciation for Jillian. She is amazing. She's funny, she's encouraging, and she's on your back constantly, as if she were right there with you. I liked this DVD so much that I bought the Body Revolution and then Ripped in 30 and her Yoga Meltdown. Awesome! I highly recommend this DVD to getcha goin' on the path to fitness.",1383177600,3,508,4.141414141414141
3084524,5,B00127RAJY,"So I must be out of the loop because most of these reviews are from 2008..haha however, I just started this DVD about a week ago and I LOVE IT so far. The first day was tough since I haven't really 'worked out' for about a year..besides taking an occasional walk or bike ride and being a 23 year old female I figured I should get in shape for the summer time! Like I said, I've only been doing it a week but in that week I lost 3 lbs and I didn't even do the DVD everyday! Obviously, you have to be eating right, too. I've been using the myfitnesspal app to count my calories (I highly recommend that app, it's a lifesaver). I am going to do this workout for longer than 30 days though--I've seen people call it the '60 day shred'..especially since I don't do it every single day (I try at least 5 days a week). I also love that you get a nice workout in a small amount of time-my work schedule doesn't give me much time to go to the gym so this 27 minute video is amazing and I feel great afterwards. GIVE IT A TRY. I will try to update this review as I get farther into my weight loss progress! LETS DO THIS!",1383177600,4,1110,3.9820627802690582
3084525,5,B00127RAJY,"This video is awesome! Jillian uses a 3-2-1 approach with strength, cardio and abs  this DVD has 3 sets of workouts, levels 1,2 and 3. 1 is for beginners but will give someone who works out fairly regularly a run for their money. This is a tough workout- but it's quick! This is a DVD everyone has time for, as it only takes 20 minutes and the only equipment needed is a mat (for us hard-floor folk) and some hand weights. It offers modified versions of exercises in each level too.
Jillian provides the motivation we've come to expect while focusing on good form. If you follow a good diet and do this DVD like you should, you WILL see results!
Cons:
I wish I could fast forward through the very beginning talk. It's not that big of a deal, but if she ever decided to re-release it, that should be addressed =p",1383091200,,811,4.300653594771242

But it is by far the easiest thing to fit into my schedule. only 20 minutes a day, who can beat that! It gives me energy and helps me tone up.",1382918400,2,435,3.898876404494382

3084535,4,B00127RAJY,"I have only been doing this workout for about a week, so I will post updates if anything changes. Here are my initial impressions:

--I started with Level 1, and didn't use weights simply because I couldn't find mine. In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't, as I was really sore the next day, even though I walk regularly and lug my 25-lb toddler around. This workout really seems to work all muscle groups.

--The workout is not 20 minutes start-to-finish. It is 20 minutes, not counting the warm-up and cool-down. Not a big deal to me, but those few extra minutes make a difference in how I budget my time to fit it in my schedule.

--My biggest gripe is that I have to watch the whole beginning part of the DVD every time I do the workout! I can't fast forward or just skip to the menu, which adds another few minutes, which does add up when I'm trying to squeeze it in during my baby's nap. I just have to start it before I'm actually ready to work out and let it sit on the menu screen until I'm ready.",1382659200,,1000,4.197916666666667
3084536,4,B00127RAJY,"I'm an avid cross-fit bootcamper but I recently went back to school in addition to working full-time and having a family. My crossfit schedule didn't fit into my lifestyle, but the 20 minute workout by Jillian Michaels does. I'm a big advocate for getting out of the house but during busy schedules, I think this is a good alternative.

I've never had any problems with tendons, ligaments, etc. Maybe because I'm used to doing exercises that are strenuous on the joints.",1382659200,,470,4.802469135802469
3084537,4,B00127RAJY,this is a good solid workout.  the 3 levels let's you continue to mix it up even after the first 30 days. some of Jillian's comments are annoying (especially when you hear them over and over and over...). but after a while you may know the routines well enough to switch to the music only version.,1382659200,,297,4.303571428571429

Dieting does not work for me because once I go back to eating what I would normally eat, that's when the pounds start to pack on.

I decided to just change my portion size but still eat what I want. I also incorporated more water in my diet because I'm not a water drinker. So here's the results so far.

I have lost 8 of the 15 pounds I wanted to lose! I am on Day 3 of level 3 and hoping to lose at least another two lbs by the time I am done with the dvd.

I gave the two latter videos a 5 star rating and the Jillian 30 Day Shred 1 star.  I simply didn't not like the transitions from standing to floorwork.  I prefer to do all my standing exercises and then do all my floorwork.

JM30DS has kept me accountable, pushed me to my limits, and help me to lose 10 lbs so far! She's awesome!

Love that there are three circuits with three parts each, so you always know how much you have left before the end of the workout.  HATE that you can't fast forward through her little intro speech.  Only need to hear that once!  Wish it had one more workout like Ripped in 30.  Wish it had three strength moves per strength circuit instead of one long one (one minute) and one short one (30 seconds).  For these reasons, Ripped in 30 is the better choice overall, but I like owning both for variety.  These workouts really shaped my upper arms and back noticeably.",1381104000,4,635,4.566371681415929

3084592,5,B00127RAJY,"I had been doing Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30 which is VERY similar to this DVD. However, this one offers a calmer less in-your-face Jillian which I found much more to my taste. The workouts are good in both and she seems to know the precise time when you are ready to quit to push you to keep going.

3084595,4,B00127RAJY,"Before buying the video (or any video) I read the reviews.  I am in my mid 60's and like a good workout.  Because of my age I'm very cautious about doing anything that will injure me.  I have Jillian's No More Trouble Zone workout and I love it so I'm very familiar with the moves in these 20 minute workouts but at a much faster pace.  However, what I will not do is follow the advanced moves as I know my limitations.  I would agree if you have bad knees or any other medical condition to avoid these workouts.  So, as long as I can do these without injury I will be doing so.

So far I've done #1 and #2 so I will do these until I feel comfortable to move on (or maybe not).  I really like Jillian's method of teaching and I love her exercises.  I'm working to get my last 10 pounds off and hope to have that complete by the end of the year.  With these exercises and eating right I'm sure I'll get to my objective.

Update:  I did Workout #3 and I was panting.  I would never attempt to do some of these jumping moves even if I were younger.  I can definitely see why people got knee injuries if they attempted to do this.  Definitely just use common sense and do not attempt to do things you don't feel comfortable with.  You can get a good workout without doing the more advanced moves - believe me.",1380067200,12,1305,4.078740157480315
3084596,4,B00127RAJY,"I purchased this video in late July and did the workout 6-7 days a week. The first week is when I felt it the most, I was red faced and covered in sweat after every workout. I didn't go to level 2 untill about 11 days because I felt like I was still feeling the burn with level 1.  Once I did got to level 2 I discovered I was not going to get a good work out doing that level for the simple fact that so much of that level is down in either PLANK Position or Push UP Position and my wrist could not handle it at all. They would start burning or they would ache the next day.  So what happened, ..well I did my best to get through level 2 a few times then ultimately  I reverted back to level one with heavier weights. I also tried level 3. Level 3 is just ok, but again with the wrist. I basicly did level 1 for a little over a month with a handful of days trying level 2 or 3. My legs are pretty fatty so I deffinetly didn't get Shredded LOL. Even though I didn't  loose numbers on the scale I started to see a little deffinition peak through on nyquads and my chest and arms looked alot slimmer.  What I LOVE is that 20 mins is a Very Doable workout and after I got through week one all the other workouts flew by. I haven't used it in about 2 1/2 weeks but will be starting level 1 again and trying to find a good SHORT cardio video to add to my routine.",1379894400,,1358,3.8530465949820787

3084599,5,B00127RAJY,"Ill get down to the important stuff first. Just starting to say i had my second baby 10months ago and i needed some sort of weight loss boost!
I didn't weigh myself, because i feel like when i do, i just tend to concentrate on a number.so i don't exactly know how much i lost. I did measure myself though and i lost:
 5inches around my hips
 2inches from my waist
 just over 1inch around my arms.
1inch around my thighs (although they look a lot smaller so im wondering if i measured wrong initially) , i also lost around my calves and upper body but i did not measure these.

I've done jillian michaels work outs before, but ive never been able to stick to them, because ive felt so spent afterwards (not the good endorphin rush if that makes sense). So i was intrigued by the 30day aspect, and the- fact that it was a 20min workout -30 if you count warm up and cool down.
I found Level 1 was already on youtube for free. So i decided to give it a go.

My goal was to do the 30 days without a rest day. For extra motivation throughout the process, i kept looking for positive reviews online and on youtube (they really did help!).
During the shred, i did end up catching a cold and get the usual aches and pains, but some days i did just push through and do the work out anyway. I think i stuck the rule of if you're ill from the neck up, its fine, but neck down, take a rest. In all i had about 6 rest days (not all at once, but here and tehre).

I have to say, i really enjoyed the whole process. It spurred me on when i started seeing the results! I would say I could see a visual difference on the third day, but started seeing a measurement difference on about day 9 i think, although it could've been sooner.

Eating wise, i did eat healthy, but i didn't deprive myself. So if i was in the mood for something sweet, id have a hot chocolate, or sometimes when i was in the mood id have a pastry! If i was out and my family were having fast food, id just have a medium fries instead of a whole meal, or i just would give it a miss!
I did swaps too, so for me, instead of eating chocolate i found that medjool dates hit that sweet craving for me.(my major weakness and a personal choice to cut it out completely. Ive never found eating chocolate to make me gain weight. But I found that if i didn't eat it, i would get a headache, so i wanted that gone.)
I still do swaps and im trying to make lifestyle changes, so i don't do ""cheat days"". I have a little bit of what i want when i want. But i don't exaggerate! This seems to be working for me, so im pleased!
There is an eating plan to go with this, but i didn't find out about it till the last level of the shred, so i juts did my own eating plan. The eating plan is free online. I think it says ripped in 30, but it still applies to the 30day shred. It looks like a good eating plan too.

I loved the first level, i found jillian to be supportive and encouraging, but in the second and thrid, i found her to be really irritating and cocky! lol. BUt that is just me. I saw a lot of reviewers say that the thrid level is killer, i actually found it to be more enjoyable than the second. I did not like level 2, but i think that is because im not keen on upper body moves.

I've decided im going to start over doing the shred again, because i enjoyed the process so much! I'm very pleased with the results.

I will add that around day 10 my knees did start to hurt, so instead of stopping, i just adjusted certain parts of the workout to accommodate, and then my the end of the second level, the pain had gone away. My thinking was that the joints are hurting because of lack of work out (for me anyway), so tehy're getting used to movement. I'm glad i persevered. I just tried to listen to my body and not push or punish my body.
I always followed the beginner workouts and sometimes i would try and do the advanced.

Now ive started doing a work out that is a bit different. It's called Ballet Beautiful, wich aims to give you longer, lean , toned look...which is what im aiming for. I'm doing the ballet beautiful 5days a week and doing the 30shred every other day.
I'm so glad i did the 30day shred, it's kick started my weight loss and even though i still have a way to go, im so pleased with the results it gives for just 20mins a day.
If you ever find yourself not wanting to do it, just tell yourself 20MINS A DAY! The only work outs you regret doing are the ones you don't do! Give yourself reasons to just do it, instead of excuses as to not!

Level 1 i did on youtube for free and bought the other two levels on amazon! :)",1379894400,12,4588,4.0241492864983535
3084600,5,B00127RAJY,"My background:  I consider myself to be generally fit.  I have worked out pretty consistently for over ten years, but my workout styles have not been consistent.  I like to change things up, both for my body and my mind because I tend to get bored with the same thing over time.  I have been lifting weights for nearly that entire time.  I have run three half marathons and done at least dozen sprint triathlons (five this summer).  I think this DVD is great for anyone at any fitness level.

What you need:  A yoga mat and three or five pound weights.  Not to sound snobby, but I didn't own anything less than 10 pounds before I got this.  I am so glad I read the recommendation on someone else' review!  They recommended three-pound weights for beginners and five-pound weights for people accustomed to training with weights.  I got both because I found that a couple of the exercises are too hard for me with the five-pounders, particularly in the shoulders.

Level One:  I found this to be very moderate.  It was mostly easy, save two exercises, which forced me to bump it to moderate :)

Level Two:  This is a big step but worth it.  At first, I found this level to be HARD.  I couldn't keep up the whole time like level one, and I was pouring sweat!  After a bit more, I can keep up better, but I still find it challenging!  I use mostly the five pound weights, saving the three pound weights for the last weight section only.

I haven't made it to level three yet, but I am looking forward to getting my butt kicked!",1379808000,,1523,4.345195729537367

As I said in my previous post about ripped in 30,if you concentrate on technique and doing the exercises correctly as opposed to repetitions, the you will most certainly see results. You can also make your own weights at home if you don't already have them. Just fill 2 700ml water bottles up and bam! Instant 1lb weights. If you want heavier ones, you can buy purified water jugs at cvs or target and use those for your rows and presses. Modify your diet, by cutting the extras, (Starbucks, Jamba juice, soda, salt, fast food, snacks) and eat fruits and veggies. Also, SUPER IMPORTAANT to make your workout the first thing that you do so that you're burning fat stores and not food that you consume for breakfast!!!

3084616,4,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels somehow radiates through the tv as you work out to push you to the limit. The first time you will feel like passing out and drinking an entire gallon of water to re-hydrate, but by day four you will feel like you just might not die, and that you are slowly feeling like it is getting easier on level 1. Then you will start level two and realize that you can still push yourself! Great dvd for beginners with no downstairs neighbors. The jump roping sections may not be the best for people who have sensitive downstairs neighbors.",1378771200,,546,4.47
3084617,4,B00127RAJY,"I thought this would be simple, being as I've done workout videos in the past.  I never realized doing a simple jumping jack for 30 seconds could be so much work.

The squats and lunges are hard on the knees, so make sure you follow Jillian's proper technique.  It won't hurt the knees then.  And I put a pillow under my knees for the push ups, because that was a little hard on my knees at this point.

I will keep up with it and hopefully get the ""up to 20lbs"" lost she says can happen (that is my goal, so that works nicely). :)",1378771200,,531,4.019047619047619

I especially like the  3-2-1 formula so you never get sick and tired of any 1 exercise.  This DVD definitely works.  Building muscle makes you more fit and helps dropping the lbs.  When I am doing this DVD regularly, I work up to doing 2 full workouts per day.  When I get busy and stop doing this, the pain in my knees and back comes back as my muscle strength  go away.  Highly recommend this DVD.  If you are a true beginner, do her Beginner DVD first and build up to this.",1378771200,2,613,4.110169491525424

3084623,5,B00127RAJY,"When I began doing the 30 Day Shred I had been working out regularly (5 days a week) doing some running and weights.  After losing a substantial amount of weight I felt I needed something that would push me harder.  My wife recommended the 30 Day Shred and I being a guy joked that I wasn't trying to look like Jillian Michaels, and expressed my somewhat serious concern that the workout wouldn't be difficult enough for me.  Wow was I wrong!  Each level is a 20 minute, fast paced workout that left me dripping sweat.  The first three days of each level were the most difficult, but you never get used to the workouts (at least I didn't).  The workouts never really get ""easy"" you just realize you can complete the circuits without taking extra breathers.  About midway through the 30 days I did start to develop some knee pain like other reviewers have mentioned, but it was a dull pain that only accompanied a few of the exercises that I felt I could work through and endure during the day with a few Ibprofen.  I completed the 30 Day Shred about a week and a half ago and lost a total of 13 lbs.  I was very pleased with the results and feel my runs are much easier now.  I liked the workouts so much that I am planning on incorporating the exercises and circuits into my long term workout routine.  I will say that I have a hard time watching exercise DVDs because they can be kinda cheesy and annoying and at times this one is no different.  What I did was I watched the DVD a couple of times and wrote down the exercises, and then did them using a stop watch to keep time while watching one of my favorite TV shows.  I would highly recommend this DVD to people who are starting to get in shape and looking for a challenge.",1378252800,,1729,4.266871165644171
3084624,4,B00127RAJY,This is a great starter for getting your body to where you want it!  I recommend it for anyone who wants to get in shape.,1378252800,,121,3.84
3084625,5,B00127RAJY,"I have owned several workout videos that weren't very effective, but this one will challenge you and start showing results within a week or so of daily use. Her formula of strength followed by brief, high-intensity cardio tires your arms and core, and leaves you sweaty right away. Following others' comments, I mixed it up -- occasionally alternating levels 1,2,& 3 according to whim instead of doing 10 days at Level 1 before moving up. Only parts of Level 3 are harder than 1 or 2, but not all. The variation keeps things from getting too stale.",1378166400,,548,4.65979381443299
3084626,4,B00127RAJY,"First up, it will work for most people - regardless of gender/age etc. That's the good news. Personally, I lost 4 pounds over the 30 days, but I was combining this with other exercise plans to do an hour a day for five out of seven days/week. I'm not convinced weight is the best metric, but it also helped shift inches so the impact on the critical body fat percentage is also good. On top of the fact that it will work, it's pretty easy to fit into your day - you only need 30 minutes or so, including warm up and cool down. That's not unmanageable. Her concept is three minutes of strength, two minutes of aerobic, one minute of core three times. So psychologically you always know where you are and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. She offers three different workouts (she likes the number three) with the implication that you do each for ten days before moving onto the next. They do get progressively more challenging so at least the first time through, that's the way to do it as you need to build up a bit to the next level. Even for the moderately active, it's a challenging workout - and level 3 in particular is an excellent workout.

What you will need are some hand weights (light is fine), ideally a good mat (esp for level 3) - thick if you have dodgy knees and possibly pushup stands if you have weak wrists as she does like to have you in plank a lot. One of the backing bouncers does a slightly lower impact version, but the differences are modest.

So there are a lot of positives. There are also some negatives though. Some won't apply to everyone. If you respond best to shouty coaches, you are in luck here. She does shout and generally seems rather angry. The soundtrack is awful so after you get familiar with the routine, it's best to pump up your own music (you cannot turn the music off unfortunately) which also has the advantage of drowning out shouty Jillian for me. She also fails to understand that we can only hear her and not her two friends so laughs maniacally when they say something apparently funny - hashtag awkward, as some would say. Most irritatingly, every time you fire up the DVD you have to listen to her self-promotion for several minutes before you get to the main workout menu. That's fine the first couple of times. Thereafter, it is infuriating.

Her strength work is potentially the most challenging. She likes to work upper body while keeping the lower body engaged in stress positions. This makes it particularly sensitive to the weight you are lifting - I struggled at first because I was lifting the same weights I would normally lift for these moves but because you are in a stress position you need to go a bit lighter. Thus lighter weights are probably better and will allow you to keep better form. This is another minor gripe - she and her backing bouncers use one set of weights throughout but I found that the different exercises required different weights to be effective. This approach has another longer term issue. It is good for aerobic workout (ie you will lose calories), less good at building lean muscle, because you are forced to use lighter weights. This means that longer term you are not building the muscle to keep fat off (muscle raises metabolism even at rest) so you will have to keep coming back to something like 30 day shred. It also seems strangely biased towards shoulders in the first two levels - maybe it improves posture so makes the impact look better?

Also be aware that level 3 in particular involves a fair bit of plyo (ie jumping up and down) work so City-dwellers / dorm room fitness fans beware - if you have people living below you they might get a little put out. Although by this stage you should be able to out run them if the get really angry ;)

Although short, after 10 days each level becomes so dull. As I said earlier, the first time through, you sort of have to build up to the next level. Thereafter, if you are doing the full 30 days, I'd strongly suggest doing level 1, level 2, level 3 and repeat rather than ten times level 1 etc. Better yet, combine it with other workouts to keep your body from getting used to the routine. If this is the only routine you do, you will soon get bored and the danger is this will stop you exercising. But as a 30 day before you go on holiday routine - it will produce results for a modest time input if you eat sensibly as well. Jillian bangs on about the diet - with reason - but there is no specific food plan associated with this DVD - but for this price, no complaints about that.",1378166400,4,4543,4.384341637010676
3084627,4,B00127RAJY,"This does provide a good workout and I like the routine of it - 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs.  However if you aren't used to these moves then you are likely too sore to do the same routine day after day.  I am supplementing with similar moves that work different muscle groups but following the same basic plan.  Just started so I can't give a statement about results but I will try to update this review when my 30 days are up:)

Also you have to purchase a separate book for diet plans.  This is a workout only video.",1378166400,,541,4.213592233009709

I started this 3 months postpartum,  lost almost the rest of my pregnancy weight (4.5 lbs of the 7 lbs i had left). I will use this video again to help switch up my routines.",1378080000,4,339,3.985294117647059
3084629,5,B00127RAJY,"There is simply nothing negative to say about this DVD.  There are a lot of dieting/exercise plans that you can invest in (and some that I fell for) that promise quick results (after you spend a pretty penny), but they're not very sustainable.  I love that for under $10 (plus another $15 for some 5lb hand weights) I found something that I enjoy, is sustainable, and inexpensive.  I just finished my 14th day (nonstop) on this DVD.  Prior to this, I was running (something I HATE to do) to try to lose some weight.  I'm 5'1"" and couldn't bring myself under 150 (I really should be closer to 115 for my height).  I had a gym membership, went to classes, spent money on B12 injections and saw a weight loss doctor (long story short... a hack who insisted that I needed to starve myself).  Money I'll never get back.  It was frustrating to feel like that money, time, and effort were for naught.  There was no change in the scale and no change in my body.

Two weeks ago, I bought 30 Day Shred.  I've lost about 4 lbs (I think... the water weight flux is always confusing), but even without a single pound of weight loss considered, I've DRASTICALLY changed the way I look in the mirror.  My once-painfully tight clothing (I refused to shop for more fat clothes, part of my self-motivation), is now loose.  I can wear clothes that were shoved into the back of the closet more than a year ago.  Let me tell you, I'm PANTING during this workout.  I've never had more than a little bit of sweat beading on my face and chest.  I'm dripping sweat by the end of the workout and I usually wait about a half an hour for my body to cool down before showering (otherwise, I'll get out of the shower and still be sweating while I'm getting dressed-- eww.)

What I love, is that yes, it's really hard, but it's also only 20 minutes.  By the time your brain and your muscles are telling you they can't handle it anymore, you're on your last set... and you can't let yourself stop when you can see the finish line.  I've really surprised myself and I can honestly say that I'm very proud of my results so far.  I can't wait to see where I'll be in another two weeks.

I plan on buying the Ripped in 30 DVD after I finish the 30 Day Shred.  This is going to be my new 'go to' daily workout.  This is part of my routine now.  I allow myself some treats once in a while, but my primary food source comes from leafy greans and lean protein.  I'm saving money by buying less processed foods, and I'm finding that I'm also less tempted by the not-so-healthy options.  It simply doesn't fit with my lifestyle anymore... it's counterproductive to the work I've been doing.",1377907200,36,2648,4.33130081300813

That being said, this workout is pretty tough. I've been on level 1 for about 3 weeks - yes, you're supposed to move after 10 days if you're going to finish in 30, but level 1 is enough for me at this point.

The best thing about this workout is the fact that its broken into 3 circuits. By the time I feel like I'm dying, I realize that I'm already almost done with circuit 2 and I only have one left - which helps tremendously.

I use 3lb weights which are still rather light.",1376438400,,366,4.097222222222222

3084666,1,B00127RAJY,"I like Jillian. I bought almost all of her dvd's in the hopes of starting to loose 30 lbs that I need to get off of my body. I am in my later 20's and a vegetarian who tries really hard to eat and drink healthfully. I get outside everyday, but really need to loose some weight.

This did not work, no matter how bad I wanted it too.

I started this in May and started right away, with a free online trial of her diet plan to help with this I was onboard and using her DVD's M-F with the weekend filled with out door activity. I was keeping track of my work outs, activities and food. I just gave up after only loosing 8 pounds, no where near the 30 I thought I would be on my way to loosing. Even at 2 pounds a week I should have lost more and I gave up with complete disappointment.

So I loved the video and it was easy to follow. Jillian has a great body and that inspired my, she is a great teacher and the video was not bad at all. I liked that it was mixed up in her 3-2-1 set up and really had high hopes. But for me it didn't work at all.",1376352000,3,1046,3.7889908256880735

It is a quick workout taking 30mins including warm up and cool down and works all parts of your body.  It is split up into circuits containing working on strength, core, and cardio. It also has 3 different levels of intensity and the two assistants focus on making the level easier or more challenging. If you don't like dvds that talk at you, there is an audio option to have music only and no voice, though I recommend you wait until you are familiar with the workout before turning the audio off.",1376179200,,625,4.288135593220339
3084675,4,B00127RAJY,"I love Jillian Michael's body, and being obese in my 20s, I wanted it. I have not worked out in a very, very long time, and I started with level 1 with 2.5 pound weights. I was able to do 2 days in a row with the weights but on the third day, I was so sore I had trouble getting down my stairs and even lowering myself to sit on the toilet. I felt terrible that I was so sore after level 1, it made me feel so pathetic. I had to take a 2 day break to give my muscles some time to heal - pretty sure I tore some of my leg muscles with the strength exercises. Today is day 5, and so far I've done the DVD 3 times. I decided to modify 2 of the exercises - the static lunge with a bicep curl, and the side lunge with anterior raise. Today I decided to do those 2 without weights; I still felt like I was getting a workout. Tomorrow I plan to use weights with one of the repetitions, she has you do those moves two or three times I think. I don't think I'll be ready to move to level 2 for a while, I want to be totally comfortable with level 1 first. I would advise anyone who is having a hard time with level 1 to try some of the exercises without weights. It's still effective in my opinion but not so damaging to my weak muscles. You do have to push yourself but, tearing muscles is no fun. Overall I love this DVD and I love that it's only 20 minutes. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1376092800,2,1379,3.825174825174825
3084676,5,B00127RAJY,I started using this video in June and decided to work-out Monday through Friday every week. I started on Level 1 which was hard - but not anything I couldn't do. I was a little sore the first few days but nothing awful. I did Level 1 for 11 workouts then moved to Level 2. It was more challenging and I found that after 11 workouts at this level I was definitely ready to move on to Level 3. I absolutely LOVE Level 3! It is very challenging but I can tell that I am definitely getting much stronger in my upper body. I can do actual full-blown push-ups now! Never before in my life have I been able to do that! (And I am 47 yrs old!) I also noticed that the muscle I had been losing in my quads - was now returning. I feel so much more toned and stronger than I ever have. Thanks Jillian for a great workout!

3084684,4,B00127RAJY,"I am a freshman (soon to be sophomore) in college and had gained about five pounds since starting freshman year. Sure, I hadn't gained the ""Freshman 15"", but I really was not happy with the way I looked at the end of freshman year. So, I hopped onto Amazon and looked at Jillian Michael's DVDs. First, let me just say that Amazon offers an amazing price for a bundle of 3 Jillian Michael's workout DVD's. I purchased the 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and 6 Week 6-Pack for about $25 and free shipping-you can't beat that! As soon as I got home for the summer, I began with the 30 Day Shred. The first day was KILLER. I hadn't worked out all year and that very first workout made me so sick. But then, I began to ease into exercising again and was okay. 30 Day Shred consists of 3 levels, each to be done for 10 days. I like this concept, but then again, after 10 days, each level began to get really boring. I practically had each level memorized by the end of each of the ten days. But, I stuck with it. I weighed myself at the end of each of the ten days, but I didn't see a huge change, which disappointed me. I saw so many success stories on Amazon's review section of the 30 Day Shred. In fact, instead of losing any weight, I gained some! But I soon figured out that I was gaining muscle, not fat. I love that Jillian works in strength moves-it made me a lot stronger. At the end of the 30 Day Shred, I had only lost about three pounds. However, I was a lot stronger and my endurance was so much better than it was when I first started. All in all, this workout DVD is great for those of us who fell off the exercising bandwagon, but want to get back on.",1375833600,,1658,4.073394495412844
3084685,5,B00127RAJY,"I've been jogging two miles, five days a week for three months now. I was starting to get a bit bored with my routine and worse, I noticed that my weight loss was reaching a plateau. I wanted to add an additional exercise routine, both to spice things up a bit and to re-fuel my weight loss (I'm 5'2"", and currently around 142 lbs; my goal weight 125-130 lbs). I was honestly more than a little skeptical about buying a work-out video from Ms. Michaels, primarily because I so loath reality TV weight loss shows (I'm sure you know the one I mean). But I decided to give these particular videos a try because you can buy one at a time. I figured I'd start with Level 1, and if I hated it, I'd only be out $1.99.

Level 1 definitely got my heart rate up, and I was a bit sore the next morning, but I didn't feel like I had worked as hard as I would have liked, so I bought Level 2 to try. First, let me say there is a pretty substantial jump from Level 1 to Level 2. That being said, it was a great work out, and was actually really fun. Jillian is, for me at least, the ideal trainer: she pushes you but is also supportive (without getting sappy and touchy-feely, which I find patronizing). She's good-natured and isn't above joking around and having a good time during the work out, but she's tough too. Basically, because she doesn't give you any outs to give up during the work out, she's saying that she believes you have it in you to finish, and I love that. I'll definitely have to spend some time at Level 2 first, but I'll be coming back for Level 3 in no time.",1375574400,,1568,4.140983606557377

This dvd is so motivational. Jillian truly surprised and inspired me. There was no yelling just consistent encouragement. For health reasons I was not able to do this workout every day. Even so, I felt I still got muscular and weight loss results. This workout gets me up and moving. Though each new round I would feel sore the first three days or so after that my body did well.

boy that was a long 20 minutes, at level ONE!

since i've done this before, i put it on mute and use one of my Hotel Costes CDs as a background music.

if you don't like listening to the same talk every time you do it, mute it and use a CD.  it doesn't have to be dance music but there should be a decent consistency (not a super fast song follow by a super slow song type of CD).  imo lounge or club music works best.

jilian's workouts work.  try to do it for 2 weeks to make it a habit.  to get the best result, slowly overhaul your diet, too.  don't cut everything ""bad"" all at once, do it slowly so to trick your body.

more than 1/2 of weight loss is in what you put in your mouth so cut easy carb and refine sugar out and replace with white meat and fresh fruit.

PLUS IT IS FAST!! 20 minutes and you really feel like you have spent hours at the gym! I would take this program over anything and I've tried a lot! so if you are wondering how to get in shape for the first time or again, you won't be disappointed!!",1374278400,2,599,4.300884955752212

It has 3 levels of exercise: level 1 for beginner, level 2 for intermediate and level 3 for advanced. Each level is 20 minutes long. Since it is only 20 min long, I think it is only for intermediate level. Advanced level should stick with Bob Harper or maybe do all 3 levels at the same time.

I gained 5 pounds while using this DVD.  I read reviews and people said that weight-loss began around level 3, I stuck it out and continued to only gain weight.  I took measurements when i began this workout and every week while using it and I lost a total of 1 inch combined from different areas on my body.  I felt like this workout was a waste of time.  I know that muscle weighs more than fat, but the fact that I didn't notice of feel any changes in my body. I hope that you have better luck than I did.",1373932800,,650,4.0390625

Its just shy of 28 minutes from start to finish on each level. I think this is the first dvd Jillian Michaels put out. I've seen a few clips of her newer dvds and you can tell the production budgets have grown as well as her head and ego. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't worked out regularly (or at all) for some time. The two other chicks in this one are nice too.,1373673600,2,532,4.076190476190476

I had to add running into the mix because it wasn't long enough for me and even with the running I haven't lost any weight. I actually gained like 5 lbs...yes I know what your going to say. I hear it all the time ITS MUSCLE! I guess I'll look like Chyna before I know it :( I have fat...that needs to go.

I have tried some insanity workouts with my husband before and it was just not for me, but this video by Jillian Michaels was perfect for me. I read a lot of reviews on many workout videos and decided to buy this one and I am glad that I did. I was looking to tone up and get in better shape and it did just that. I am on my last week and can noticeably see a difference from when I started. I really like the fact that the workouts are only 20 minutes long. I feel that getting in better shape with this video has pushed me to work even harder at getting in shape by running daily. Overall I would recommend this video to people who are looking to tighten and tone in a short amount of time.",1373587200,,774,4.0

3084747,4,B00127RAJY,This will definitely give you the intense workout you're looking for. I usually put it on silent after a while and put on music instead - Jillian can get a little irritating.

The 30-day Shred is fast paced and varied enough to keep me engaged and interested without growing bored of any one set of reps. I think the constant switching between upright and floor movements really helps. It's a butt-kicking workout. You are constantly moving - and before you know it, you're done! Highly recommended - even to those who hate working out. :-)",1373414400,4,486,4.534090909090909

3084752,5,B00127RAJY,"Update as of August 3. I almost finished the 30 day shred, 4 days left. Although I haven't moved up to level 3 yet, I gotta admit: Jillian is simply THE BEST! I can't stop looking at the mirror and checking myself out. I got definition everywhere, my whole body is slimmer, more toned. All my old clothes that I almost threw out now fit perfectly. Men started to pay compliments to me and the way I look. I have more confidence in myself. I am an actress (theatre) and it's very important for me to look great, especially with all those young and skinny girls coming in. Also I am more athletic now, I can jump and run, and I always hated it.
Yes, I ate extremely healthy: mainly organic, whole foods, lots of veggies, no sugar or flower. But I didn't even give up my wine!
I am 41 years old, and I was size 12 for a couple of years, and it was driving me crazy. Now I am back to size 10 and keep shrinking! I look 30 and I feel 30, thanks to Jillian.
To sum it up: If anyone tells you that you can't tone up and lose weight because of age, metabolism, body constitution, genetics or any other stupid excuse - don't listen. Eat right, do Jillian's exercises, and try to get rid of stress as much as possible - and you will be healthy, slim, energetic, happy and beautiful. Guaranteed!

3084757,5,B00127RAJY,"I absolutely love this video! Before this, I used to play tennis or go on the elliptical to ""work out,"" but since I didn't do those on a daily basis, they just weren't enough to build muscle. After reading the reviews, I decided to buy this DVD along with 8lb hand weights. After huffing and puffing and barely crawling through the first level 1 workout, I knew I had to move down to 5lb weights. I'm 20-years-old and fairly fit, but MAN, this workout is HARD! HOWEVER, not stupidly hard enough to do everyday for a little under 30 minutes.

I got my 6' tall, 170 lb gym-rat boyfriend to workout with me one day 'cause he couldn't believe that the workout was that hard. He checked out my weights and told me the 3lb weights fit me a lot better. Afterwards, he was certainly sweating and took back what he said about my workouts being easy. He agreed it was a great cardio workout (but said he needed much heavier weights than 5 lb to build muscle... whatever!).

Some recommendations to make your workout more effective --
1. Get the right weight dumbbells. Go to the store and lift a weight to the side of your body, your arm straight out, and see if you can hold it for 10 seconds.
2. Push ups are hard. Try searching on Google how to get better at push ups. Start at the wall, on a table, or a low couch. Whatever you're most comfortable doing during the workout.
3. Get heavier weights for chest presses! They're super easy and you don't get too much out of them if you don't pump up the weights.

If you're still wondering if you should get this, GET IT! If you stopped and if you're wondering if you should continue with this workout, KEEP GOING! I've been at this for a while now, and my clothes look a lot better on me now! Good luck to everyone!",1373241600,4,1755,4.280120481927711

I couldn't finish level 2 the first few times, so I would alternate levels 1 and 2.  Now, I can complete level 2.  Once I get good at all 3 I will start doing two levels in a row.

The only thing is she talks A LOT. Some times it's awesome and motivational and some times I just wanted her to HUSH and let me work.

3084769,5,B00127RAJY,"Hello everyone,
I have been using this DVD for 6 days now(just started level 2 yesterday)and I decided that it was the perfect time to write a review.
I have to say that my first day wasn't easy. I was dead with the warm up and I did just half of the work out. The next day (2nd day) my legs were a little sore but even with that ""problem"" I was able to finish the work out and I felt great and really proud. The 3rd day I was really sore and needed a break but I walked for 30 minutes in the morning and 30 at night and went up and down on the stairs few times to keep my body moving. The 4th day I was felling great and did the work out twice ( morning and night), and the days 5 & 6 I started the level 2 and I am doing really good and I am shaking and dead by the end of the exercises because she really kicks your butt. It maybe hard in the beginning for people like me who never did anything like this, but it is easy and Jillian motivates you all the time. She has 2 ladies to help her to show how the exercises should be done. One shows the easy way to do it ( for beginners) and the other one shows the harder way  (advanced). I also got a yoga mat and some weights (You need them to do the exercises). I started with the easy way and I didn't do so well in the beginning but I didn't give up and now I am following the harder way and I am so happy. I have noticed the changes in my body already and you will too. I am doing a diet by eating health in the right times and drinking lots of water and having dinner not later than 6pm . Please eat health so you can see better results. Keep moving! Don't give up! You can do it!",1372464000,3,1634,3.7638483965014577

Days 1-4 of Level one killed me. but after that it got better. The first 2 days of level 2 were really hard too! But I've gotten SO much stronger since Day 1 on L1. It definitely takes effort and is a challenge! I'm currently on day 2 of L3 and I will say that it is easier than L2. I would not suggest weighing regularly while doing this program! If you are not fit when you start you are most definitely going to gain muscle! But muscle kick fat in the rear! It takes up less space and burns 3x as many calories as fat....even when you aren't working out. I suggest tracking progress through measurements and pictures.

3084775,5,B00127RAJY,"That was my thought on the first day of doing Workout 1. Day 3, I'm thinking, ""okay, this might be a good thing."" Day 5: I'm really liking this. Day 7: I can't wait to get home and work out. I am getting results very quickly, which is always motivating.

Jillian talks you through those moments when you just want to say, ""this is too hard; I give up."" Don't give up. Do what you can and build up more each time. The key is consistency.

One thing I wish she would do, though, is give us a little longer cooldown at the end of Workout 1. Haven't seen the other two workouts yet so I don't know how long the cooldowns are, but I keep moving and stretching for a couple of minutes after Workout 1 ends because I just feel like it stops too quickly after all that intensity.",1372291200,,771,4.099337748344371

3084780,1,B00127RAJY,"I had this on my wish list to buy it later but I was listening to Jillian's podcast yesterday and she said that Ripped in 30 is tons better. 30 Day Shred DVD work out is old and that Ripped in 30 is way more advanced and knowledgeable work out system.

I thought it was great that she actually voiced this, coming from the horses mouth, and she acknowledges that her new system workouts are better for getting the results you want. I work out 5 days a week with high intensity and appreciate her honesty. She also recommends to work out 5 days on, 2 days off. Listen to her podcasts (It's free on iTunes!), she truly does want to make your health and fitness better!",1372204800,31,666,4.244094488188976

It's about 20 minutes long, so it can be fit into any schedule, and, I believe that the most people should be able to do the exercises as none are very strenuous on the body and joints. That does not mean that everyone is going to get through the whole workout the first time. Believe me, I did not , but after a week straight, I was able to.
I also like the workout because it only requires you and a pair of hand weights.

I wanted results but I didn't have time for the talking and talking and loooong workouts.  A friend recommended this to me and I was immediately in love.  Jillian does not dilly-dally or small talk you to death.  You get to work, you work hard, you're completely done in under 25 minutes.  I saw real results fast, even after baby #4.  I thought it would take me a lot longer to get in shape.  I could not only see my body losing fat and getting more cut, but I also noticed my endurance increasing.  My bike riding skills drastically improved and I was riding longer and harder than I ever thought I could.  Even my husband started doing and he hates it (in that good, butt-kicking way).

I would have never believed you could work out for 20 min/day and have it actually make a difference. BUT THIS DOES! I have done this video 9 of 11 days and I see a huge improvement in my stamina and I swear I can see my legs toning up already! Make no mistake, this video is HARD. Like, discouragingly hard. But do it for a week -- however you have to get through it-- and you will see improvement quickly. And this is coming from someone who is 15 lbs overweight and NOT in to exercise!!! Jillian will instruct you to keep moving, no rests, etc., but if you can't do it, just do your best! The first few days I had to stop occasionally (or even drop my hand weights at times), but I'm now doing the whole video. 20 minutes (of brutality), then it's done!

So I decided to try 30 day shred. Jillian kicked my butt! With three short circuits of strength, cardio, and abs to help the body. When I started out I got easily winded, and my wrist was weak because I hadn't been using it for a month because I had was having problems (later found out I had cysts). The weights was one of the reasons I wanted to use the DVD to strength my bad hand. Weight isn't main goal, but to get healthy. Building muscles is part of that, it takes more then being a skinny minnie. My endurance was improving and you really do see results quickly (if you do it everyday, and eat decent). Jillian is a good motivator, she laughs, she warns you what not to do so you don't hurt yourself. Will be checking out other videos :)",1371772800,,909,4.170454545454546

3084796,5,B00127RAJY,"OK I've bought a few workout DVDs in the past, but this is the first one I've managed to stick with. I think I spent the first few days screaming at my TV screen and being on the verge of quitting, but something about Jillian kept my going and the workout was over before I knew it. I'm 5'4"" and 140 and I have zero upper arm strength. I could BARELY do one pushup with good posture, but I was able to do at least 10 by the time I was halfway through level 1! I still do pushups on my knees, but I've made a big improvement before Jillian entered my life! By day 7, I started seeing some serious definition in my arms, stomach, and legs.

If you want to workout at home and see improvements I would buy this DVD! You'll need to buy some dumbbells, but this DVD is inexpensive and 3lb and 5lb weights were all I needed and they didn't cost much.",1371772800,,844,4.023809523809524

I have had this video for a few years and have done it off and on.  I made a commitment to myself to get up before work and do it M-F.  I did it and of course I saw changes and moved on to her Rin30 as I was ready for more of a challenge.

3084799,4,B00127RAJY,"I considered myself fairly in shape before buying this workout video. I needed to continue working out this summer for my health. I also wanted to begin strength training since I mostly do cardio-only. I visited the gym regularly. I heard Jillian was tough, so I decided to give it a shot.

I only did one day of day one but was surprisingly sore after even though going through the exercises were pretty doable for me. Day two was a lot more challenging and I plan on sticking with it for a while until I can go through it comfortably enough to move on.

I bought two of her other DVDs and so far so good, I would recommend it to anybody. I am starting to see definition in my abs and can't wait to keep sweating!",1371772800,2,714,4.204379562043796
3084800,5,B00127RAJY,"This workout is hard.  You have to sweat and you can't cut corners.  But the good news it only lasts 20 minutes.  The first time I did the video it was so hard that while I made it through I definitely had to take few little breaks.  The first few days it was hard to walk.  My legs were killing me!  But it only lasted about three days and then the workout got easier.  Well not easier but managable.  You still sweat bullets and are so glad when it is over and thrilled that you did it.  After level one you can move on to level two and then the hardest level: three.

What I did with this was as I built myself up I started doing two of them.  First level one and level two back to back. I hope to be able to do level two and three back to back and then I hope to be able to do all three of them.

You can definitely get ""shredded"" with this workout but I don't think you can do it in 30 days.  Real physical fitness takes longer than that.  However, after 30 days you will definitely have lost weight and feel great about yourself.

It's a really good DVD for the money.

FYI: It does require hand weights and a yoga mat.  You could get by without both but you should at least have a little resistance. Use soup cans if you have nothing else.  Then go out an buy some cheap hand weights (between 1 and 3 pounds should be enough).",1371686400,,1333,3.9660377358490564

There is a LOT of jumping jacks (second week is less, thank goodness) so if you have had kids and, well you know ladies, then be aware, a LOT of jumping!

Jillian gives you a great work out, including a warmup and cool down, inside 30 minutes. There are 3 levels of intensity, and while each workout definitely leaves you feeling like you worked for it, none of the exercises themselves are complex or require skill.

I read some of the negative reviews and agree that this workout can be hard on the knees, but I thought that the beginner modifications really helped me keep good form and not injure myself. I definitely could not perform like Natalie! I'm currently staying in Level 2 as I tried 3 and it was way too hard for me to get throughout without repeated breaks. I love this DVD and appreciate whenever a workout routine can be done with minimal necessities, such as one set of weights and not a slew of products I'd have to go out and buy. As someone who has slaved away for hours at the gym, doing endless hours on the stair climber and elliptical with moderate weight training, I found that 20 minutes of her techniques provided far greater improvement and weight loss than I was getting on my own.

It's not super girly, so my husband will actually do it with me, and I don't feel ridiculous the way i do with aerobics as i am definitely not coordinated.

One negative I have for this video is that Jillian Michaels gets really annoying after a while and she's a bit snide at times. I can't really see a huge change yet but I'm only on day 6 and I'm hoping that I see results by day 20. I would recommend this video. Beginners can learn a lot, just pay attention and don't do the moves if you can't do them without being safe.

I just did my first day on the first workout and it was amazing! I'm still getting down from the high of the workout! Pretty much all of the moves are things that I used to do in my strength and conditioning classes but you have to keep up with it and don't let yourself take breaks. By the end I caught myself getting lazy with the moves but hopefully I can stop that!

Definitely wear decent shoes when doing this! Right off the bat I noticed my arches getting a little strained.

I feel amazing after working out to level one, I can't imagine I won't feel the same way after levels 2 and 3.  She explains proper form, and what not to do, which is a good thing - I know I'm doing the exercise correctly the first time, fixing any bad posture or form right away instead of wondering WHY the workout isn't being effective after a month.

I've been training with a personal trainer a couple of times a week for a few years but I honestly feel I've gotten more out of the 30 Day Shred DVD in 3 weeks then I have in the last few months of personal training.

The only thing I'd change is that warm needs to be a little longer (but it is a 20 minute workout, a short warmup is to be expected).  I do my own warmup for about 2-3 minutes before Jillian starts.",1370390400,,490,3.979591836734694

3084844,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought the 30-Day Shred in February and have been using it to work out for the past 4 months. I have lost 7 pounds, which may not sound like much, but it is to me. Rather than doing the video series for just 30 days, I chose to do each level workout for one month. Workout one equaled sore arms, Jello-y legs and a feeling of accomplishment. I ended up doing the first workout for about 45 days before moving up to workout two.

Once I started doing workout two, I felt like I hit a wall of motivation. I hated the workout. Not that it was so challenging that I couldn't do it- more like I just hated the workout. I found that I was sleeping through my workouts or finding any excuse to do a different workout.

Then I decided to move on to level three. I'm so happy I did. The workout is so much more enjoyable to me. I love waking up in the morning and doing my workout. I see a six pack under a little layer of fluff (though admittedly much smaller layer of fluff than before). I'm much happier with my body now. I have some seriously strong legs and arms... and back... and stomach... and butt. There's really not a part of my body that isn't better toned now.

I recently lost 45 lbs, and reached a stall in weight loss. I was looking for a workout that would tone and flatten my stomach, what I got was a leg-heavy routine, full of squats and lunges. I have to admit, I did feel the burn from this workout, it was tougher than my hour long routine at the gym in 25 minutes; however not in my abs. Not only that, but I lost no weight, and my stomach actually looked fuller to me. So I decided that I would try a different routine that has more cardio, but I will be keeping this video in the lineup for my strength training days.",1370390400,,704,4.035714285714286

I am somewhere in the middle. I am not as tone as I would like to be but am in good physical shape and this work out is a work out for me. I love the levels and love switching between them to work different muscles in different ways. If you stick to the work out and don't rest, it is only 20 min after all, you will see results!

I am NOT a person who typically sticks with exercise, but I found this super motivating for some reason. I like the circuit format--I know what's coming next and I like that you don't do any one exercise for more than a couple of minutes, and I like that it's only 25 minutes. I also like that I got results FAST. I am in better shape now than I probably have been in 15 years. I haven't lost much weight, but I have whittled my thighs and bottom (my biggest problem area) and I have a nice little 6-pack in the works. I am really proud of how fit I have become.

I absolutely love this and her ""tough love"" style. I almost find it comical and it gets me through the whole 25mins (yes only 25 mins). I'm no stranger to workouts, You will usually find me in the gym at least 5 days a week, doing a mix of cross fit, weights and cardio. I have also done insanity. Needless to say I don't have much/any weight to loose but It has only been a week and my muscle tone and stamina have improved (Each day I do a different level to keep from burnout/monotony.) I also purchased 6 week six pack (It's no Joke) and No More Trouble Zones, both of which are great to mix in. Honestly if you can find 25 minutes (yes I'm a mom of a busy 2 year old so I know it can be tough) then what are you waiting for?!",1370044800,,863,3.994219653179191

If I can do it, anyone can do it.  Jillian keeps it interesting and I like her style.  I've only done the level 1 workout so far and it really kicked my butt.

3084860,5,B00127RAJY,"When I first started getting serious about getting in shape a few years ago, I did a lot of research about workout DVDs and heard a lot of good things about the 30 Day Shred and, based on word of mouth and the fact that the DVD was pretty cheap, I bought it.  I was vaguely familiar with Jillian Michaels, but had never seen her in action.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into!

Jillian uses a ""3-2-1"" system, meaning 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  The first time I did the level 1 workout I could barely get through it.  I screamed a few choice words at the Jillian on my TV.  The next day, going down stairs was excruciating.  I kept at it, and it got easier.  Never easy, but I gained endurance.  I got stronger.  I started to see results.  I eventually worked up the courage to try level 2 and level 3.  They were hard.  They got easier, but never easy - just the way a workout should be.

I stopped doing the Shred for various reasons and have been doing other workouts over the past couple years, but I recently started doing it again and I found that it is still a terrific workout.  Even though I'm much stronger and in much better shape than I was when I initially started doing this workout, it's still challenging and still gets results.  I can now do level 1 and level 2 back to back!

If you're looking for a workout that is highly effective but doesn't take up a lot of your time, I cannot recommend this highly enough.",1369872000,3,1477,4.162544169611308

The DVD: It works great, no issues there. As always, it has an easy-to-use menu, which I know anyone who uses her DVDs appreciates this, especially when you want to get straight to your workout without any hassle.

The Workouts: I love both all 3 levels, they get the blood flowing & heart rate going. Jillian has you work on different muscle groups than ""Ripped in 30"" & ""6 Week Six-Pack"" it's a nice change of pace. These are tough workouts but it's worth it. I love how positive Jillian is throughout the entire workout as well. I personally like to do Level 1, 2 or 3 from ""30 Day Shred"" & then one from ""6 Week Six-Pack""; the two combined are amazing & sure to get results fast. These workouts will come in handy during the winter when it's dark, raining & snowing because Jillian has you do cardio & strength. In my opinion, I much prefer this to ""Ripped in 30"".

Overall: Highly recommend for fans of Jillian & anyone looking to get toned fast. ""30 Day Shred"" & ""6 Week Six-Pack"" are my favorites!",1369872000,,1197,4.334821428571429

She makes each workout challenging yet not so difficult that you give up. Each interval is short enough so that you don't get bored with the circuits. I also love that almost all moves are easily modifiable and you can add or remove hand-weights.

I wish each workout was a bit longer than 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes would be perfect. Sometimes I even do two videos in one workout, but usually I'm exhausted after completing just one. Level 1 and 2 are both very challenging and are enough to replace a gym session.

(And I'm in pretty decent shape already!)  There are 3 levels, and you can advance yourself as you feel the need to do so.  There's nothing saying you HAVE to do Level 1 for X days before going to Level 2.  I did Level 1 only 3-4 time before moving to Level 2.  I've been on Level 2 for nearly 2 weeks, and am just about ready to bump it up to Level 3.

Blink an eye, and you're done with this high-energy workout...you don't get bored at all, because you're only doing 1-2 min of each move at a time, and the entire workout is done in 25-30min. Does that mean this workout is easy? No way! It is JM afterall =) You'll be dripping in sweat and feel so accomplished at the end of each session!",1369353600,,366,4.304347826086956

Her legs and arms are toning up and best of all she loves that it's only about a 20 -25 minute workout. It comes with three different workout levels so you can go at your own pace and switch levels whenever you feel you're  ready for the next challenge. Definitely recommend if you're looking to shred those extra inches but I wouldn't recommend for only 30 days. You should include this workout as an everyday routine.,1369353600,,533,4.494845360824742

I tried other workouts but always got so bored with them that I would quit eventually. 30 Day Shred holds my interest and I find myself enjoying it the entire time BUT it is very challenging!! There is a downside to this, though. It is very hard on your knees and I am only on Workout 1.

While I find Jillian to be kind of obnoxious (she tends to say things like ""that is the feeling of fear leaving your body"" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!), ultimately I found it to be a very effective series of workouts.  I saw visible change in my body and my running times improved.

Now I still do the workouts but modify them slightly (heavier weights, etc) because I was pleased with what it did for my fitness.",1369180800,,653,4.241935483870968

If you can stick with it everyday, you'll definitely see and feel the difference.  So far, we've only been able to do about 7 days in a row because of our busy schedules. It's hard to commit to working out everyday and we prefer working out every other day for longer than 20 minutes.

Both say in 20 minutes a day you can get results.  30 day shred actually worked.  I will say the first workout is hard but not impossible.

3084902,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm a working mom who's in-shape and no stranger to exercising. Jillian Michaels really pushes you with combo moves. I'm really impressed with how effective these workouts are. Definitely start with level 1. And I recall reading a review complaining about how she doesn't stop to take breaks or drink water. Well, she tells you exactly why she's doing it. I sip water intermittently and keep moving. Another thing is that she's not annoying like a lot of workout video hosts. She's informative, motivating, and knows when a laugh is a bit of a release. I'm at level 2 and am really glad I bought this.",1368489600,2,601,4.679245283018868

3084904,5,B00127RAJY,"Let me begin by saying this about me: I am in my mid 30's. I am vegan, do not eat any processed foods, nothing that comes in a box, I load up on tons of veggies and fruit, and am in very good shape. I do a lot of yoga and pilates but not too much cardio. I am 5'5 and weigh about 120. I do not weigh myself nor measure myself as a rule but that is approximate. I am a fit, size small. I tell you all of this because I think that when you are reading these reviews and hearing that people are losing weight, that information needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Who are these people, what is their diet, how much did they initially weigh, etc?  If this video is not being done in combination with healthy eating, you are not going to be losing weight and inches. Losing weight should be a conscious decision that should come with other changes in our habits and choices. I started this video after a long vacation in Europe in which I was not exercising too much and eating a lot of delicious food. I was feeling a bit out of sorts and needed a video to bring me back to feeling strong and lean.

All of that being said, I really love these videos and see a big difference in my own body after just 9 days. I am more toned, slim and have more energy. Jillian is great and her format is effective. She is very clear on form and is very encouraging. Video 1 is very do-able and preparers you for the other videos.

****Update
I finished the series. I definitely got smaller and much much more toned. I was not looking to lose weight so I did not have a goal in mind - except to tone a bit. I will say though this: BE CAREFUL with all the ""explosive"" moves. Explosive moves are NOT good for the cartilage, ligaments, joints and soft tissue of your body. Your body is NOT designed  to handle explosive moves repetitively. That is why Athletes and hard core exercise people have multiple injuries. If you want to maintain your body for the longterm- I really suggest that you go light on the jumping. I substituted a lot where there was maximal impact and I still look AMAZING and toned after 30 days. You will not be losing by going light- you will still be burning fat and boosting metabolism, but you will also be protecting the structures of your body and cannot handle impact. IE- Joints! I also felt that a few of the ab exercises were totally unsafe and I substituted ones that were just as effective but caused minimal wear and tear on the discs. I do not recommend anything where you are laying on your back and your legs are straight out ahead hovering on the floor. All you need to do is listen to your body and you might notice that this is an inherently unsafe move. There are plenty of other moves that work better. Check out pilates moves from other videos online and choose the ones that cause you NO pain.

I love Jillian and I think these are a great set. They just need some modification :)",1368489600,2,2906,4.191413237924865

The first time I did this workout I thought I was going to die! But after just three days of doing it, I have twice as much energy, and its already getting easier. For anyone who is at their ends wit, I say this is a good butt kicking way to wake you up.

My body ached SO bad for the first few days, but it's totally worth it! My body got used to it a bit and I don't feel like someone beat the hell out of me, I just feel GREAT! I just started level 2 today. I'm seeing muscle tone in places I've never seen before!! It's not easy but I find myself more and more proud of myself for pushing myself to get through it.

All this is great the first time, but we can't pass this in subsequent viewings?  I guess if I want to continue doing the workout, I'll start the DVD before I get dressed, water, weights and towel.

There are no excuses to skip your work out if its only 25 minutes long. What I love about these workouts is that all the exercises are combination moves so that you are maximizing your time (working arms and legs at the same time). I also like the fact that you do not need a lot of room or equipment (maybe hand weights) and that's it. NO EXCUSES!,1367539200,3,489,4.157894736842105

You work large muscles with small ones to burn more fat this way thus speeding up the changes. Workouts are about 25 min each because of the warm up and cool down.

It can be a little hard on the knees with all of the jumping jacks and squats, but as long as you use good form it is doable. I definitely have not lost up to 20 pounds, but I have lost at least 5 and that is without following her diet. I do not follow the diet, because it is only free for a little while and then you have to pay. All in all I am enjoying this DVD and seeing results. I think it offers a solid, quick workout that I will and have been recommending to other people.",1367193600,,651,3.8656716417910446

3084951,5,B00127RAJY,"This was my first Jillian Michaels workout and certainly won't be my last. This is really great workout. I began adding it to my routine five days a week. I didn't really have high expectations since it's only a twenty minute workout. However, by week two, I noticed real results. My arms feel a lot stronger, and Jillian is a great motivator. There are even changes in my core. Going to buy more of her!",1367107200,3,404,4.4

3084953,4,B00127RAJY,"When I decided several months ago it was time to get into shape I bought this DVD since I had heard so many great things about it.  It kicked my flabby butt into shape in about a week!  The first day on level 1 I could barely do one push-up and after a week I could do about 20!  I used 7 pound weights because those are what I had and I noticed a big difference in my upper body.  I moved onto levels 2 and 3 (level 3 is crazy and I had to buy 5 pound weights to get through it) and bought some of Jillian's other workouts (No More Trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, 6 Week 6 Pack, and Killer Buns and Thighs).  After trying out her other more dynamic workouts, I have not gone back to Shred.  What I've noticed about Shred as compared to Jillian's other DVDs is that she does many more reps in Shred which can get mentally tedious after awhile (and physically exhausting).  If you are looking for a similar workout with more variety I would recommend Ripped in 30, which uses the same circuit format as Shred but adds another move in the strength portion to break it up a bit. (It also includes 4 workouts instead of 3).

All of Jillian Michaels' DVDs have given me great results beyond what I expected, and I want to speak specifically about the results I have gotten working out with her 5-6 days a week for the past several months. When I started I was not looking to lose weight but to tone and tighten, and I have since gained about 3-4pounds. I was initially surprised by this (I never thought exercise would make me GAIN weight) and occasionally after a workout I feel a bit ""bulky"" the next day. I read that weight training can cause the body to initially retain water but my weight gain has stayed pretty consistent since starting this routine. I wanted to mention this as I have only read reviews describing weight loss and that may not be the case for everyone. Overall I am very pleased with my results and look and feel much healthier and more athletic.

Though I have moved onto her other workouts, Shred was the perfect place for me to start with Jillian and I would highly recommend it to start your fitness routine.",1367020800,2,2128,4.27363184079602
3084954,4,B00127RAJY,"This workout is quite good.  It takes 30 minutes to get through each workout.  I typically like to work out longer, but when I finish this one, I don't feel shortchanged.  A couple of annoying things about the dvd (otherwise I would have given 5 stars):
1.  You have to sit through the intro every time; I haven't found a way to skip or fast-forward to the workout, and it's not exactly a quick intro, either.
2.  She tends to start and finish on the same leg or arm, so one side gets an extra rep.  Maybe it's just me, but I like balance and knowing both sides get the same exact workout.  So, I typically rush an extra rep in before starting the next exercise.",1367020800,,662,4.2063492063492065

I only have 10lb dumbbells and I need to buy 5lbs this weekend...they use 5lbs in the DVD and I wouldn't use anything more, especially to start.  I feel like I'm going to be very sore later today/tomorrow lol! But over all I think I was able to do 16min of the 20min workout so not too shabby!

I do not know about the content on the DVD when it plays, because when I put the disk in I kept getting a ""Insert Disk"" message on my screen. I tried it multiple times on my dvd player, and switched between DVDs just to make sure it was the DVD and not my player. AND in the process I accidentally destroyed my FAVORITE work out dvd due to my own anger and took it out too briskly while switching back and forth and broke the disk. But yea really disappointing. Unfortunately I did not read back enough in the reviews, because other people had the same problem as well. So beware, it works on some DVD players and not others, as I gave it to a chick who lives a floor above me and it played fine. If you want a DVD that works on ALL DVD players and not on just a few then this is not the disk for you.",1366675200,,842,3.9011627906976742

Like most of you, i want results  and i want them fast. I felt this on day one and still feel it on day 25.

Then, I thought I would get the Ripped in 30 DVD at the store.  1 day of doing that video my knees were killing me.  I couldn't bend down without feeling like they were going to give out.  I noticed no difference after a week of completing week 2 of that DVD.  I like the way Jillian talks to the viewers in the 30 Day Shred whereas the Ripped in 30 is her smacking her assistants and saying a lot of ""get after it!!!"" which is distracting for me.

So, I'm sticking with the 30 Day Shred - better results and easier on the knees.  I feel like there is more aerobic/movement type exercises rather than planks with jumps like in the other DVD.",1366502400,2,879,4.040462427745664

They are quick workouts (which I need right now to motivate me to Just Do It)- they leave you tired, sweating, and honestly- it makes me long to work even harder.

She has 2 other girls on the DVD with her showing how to do amended moves for beginners and the tougher moves for those more advanced. I have already started shedding some weight.

Also worth nothing is that the DVD cost less than $10. Compared to a gym membership cost, it is a steal.

I would rate it 5 stars except I don't like that every time you turn the DVD on, you need to watch 5-10 minutes of an intro; you cannot fast forward or skip. I've learned to skip back to the beginning and then stop so that its queued up on the following night.",1366156800,,578,4.06140350877193

I don't often bother to do reviews, but I am so pleased with this DVD I wanted to share my experience and encourage anyone who might be on the fence about it that this is an effective workout. I never watched Biggest Loser but was familiar with Jillian Michaels, and bought this figuring she would help whip me into shape. And wow, I am not disappointed. This is a challenging - yet fun and upbeat - workout, with 3 levels. Each workout is about a half hour long (she calls them 20 minute workouts, but there is a warmup and a cool down for each - WHICH I TOTALLY COUNT, thank you very much (!) and make the total time closer to 30 minutes). I am currently on week 3, continuing to rotate all 3 levels (mostly switching back and forth between 2 and 3 at this point) and like them all. Each version has parts that seem relatively easy/do-able, and each has at least one part that seems darn near impossible... at least until after a few more days of trying. The thing that has impressed me the most is the SPEED at which I am seeing improvement. There were exercises (""circuits"") which I could barely do the first time or in the first week... and on day 21 I can tell you, I can do them ALL - even the advanced versions following Natalie. I can really see and feel a difference in my weight, my fitness, and especially my abs.

3085062,5,B00127RAJY,"Quick background information: I'm in my mid-30s and have 3 young children. I only had about 5 or so pounds to lose, but I really wanted to tone up. The problem: between family, work and school, the last thing I have time for is to set aside an hour or more to work out consistently. So when I saw that I could do this workout in such a short amount of time, I figured it was worth a shot. I didn't expect much, but by the time I finished Level 1 I was shocked by the results: flatter tummy, firmer butt, and some definition in my arms! Normally, I absolutely HATE working out, and lose interest in my ""exercise of the moment"" but seeing the change happen so quickly with this program has really motivated me to stick with it. I did miss a day here and there, but even with my schedule I am able to be consistent.

I realize that some people may be put off by it, but I love Jillian's ""drill sergeant"" style; I need someone to tell me to push through the pain. It also helps that she has a similar petite frame that I have, so I can kind of envision what I have the potential to achieve.

UPDATE: I moved onto Levels 2 and 3, and I have to say that I didn't enjoy the exercises as much as Level 1 because I found them awkward to do, and very hard on my knees. What I ended up doing was going back to Level 1, but using heavier weights. Then when I got back to Levels 2 and 3, I substituted the painful exercises (like the squat thrusts ad mountain climbers) with more intense versions of Level 1 exercises.",1365984000,,1505,4.081081081081081

3085100,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian is not lying when she says ""this is no joke"". The only thing I was doing when I first finished level 1 was gasping for air and wondering ""why the heck did I decide to start working out again?!?!"" But seriously, as a new younger mother, being 5'9'' and 220 lbs. was devastating for me. I have been quite active my whole life and have an athletic build, but that was masked by baby fat and cellulite. I bought this DVD thinking ""ok, well, the worst that can happen is that I stay the same"". I mean whats 20 minutes anyways? I'm going to be honest here... the first week of the workout was brutal for me. So brutal that I stopped doing it. I didn't think the pain was worth it. A few days later I weighed myself and... I lost 3 lbs...? How was that even possible? Those 3 lbs. gave me the motivation to suck it up and commit to making a serious lifestyle change with Jillian Michaels help. The DVD is only 20 minutes long, but in order to see results you really have to push. Jillian uses her 3-2-1 method (3 minutes stregnth, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs). You repeat the 3-2-1 method twice for each leveled workout (3 intervals total). While doing certain intervals (for me it's the plank jacks and double jump rope in level 2) you really do feel like you cannot go on. If you are determined and disciplined enough and actually give it your all you WILL SEE RESULTS. It's been about two weeks that I have been really serious about this workout and I have definitely noticed a change in my body. I actually go to the gym in the morning to get more cardio in before I do the tape now. Level 1 is easy for me, and I never thought I would say that. I'm still on level 2, but I will be switching to level 3 in another 3 days. The only thing I would change about this DVD is the horrible background music. I wear headphones while working out to the shred now... I couldn't take the elevator music anymore. Even though I can't hear Jillian's voice motivating me, her death stare through the television is enough to keep me going! She really is an inspiration and an amazing trainer! Just know that you can't do a workout DVD and then go eat three cheeseburgers though. You have to eat healthy and clean to see maximum results (as Jillian states in the beginning). This DVD has changed my life! I'm now down to 206 lbs and have more energy than I have had in months! People have told me that i look like i weigh a lot less than i do, and ask me where i find the time to workout so much!! I'm not where I want to be but with Jillian's help I know ill get there! This DVD was/is a steal and I would recommend it to anyone that is serious about losing weight and gaining confidence. Overall I am beyond happy with my purchase.",1365638400,4,2727,4.186311787072244

I was still sore the next day, but I remember thinking back several months how I would pray for the 20 minutes to end. I couldn't have gotten in shape to begin with without this video.

3085137,4,B00127RAJY,"I DID THE 30 DAY SHRED FOR 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS

I decided to try this DVD because I wanted something intense- I had recently gained 25 pounds (from holiday binging and from a 6-week trip back home to the USA -I live abroad-) Yes 25 pounds in about 3 months (after I had lost those 25 pounds and kept them off for 2 years!)
I'm a 5 foot 4ish and started the shred at 172 pounds.

I didn't change my diet too much except for paying attention to portion control, only eating when I was truly hungry, and trying to cut out soda and desserts.
I did the shred everyday, but not at the same time everyday.

The easiest day was day one- why I don't know but maybe because I didn't know what to expect.

The hardest days were days 2-6. I wanted to give up. I didn't see how I'd ever move on to workout 2. I wasn't seeing results. (That said, I don't think it was going to be realistic for me to lose 20 pounds in 30 days! My goal was 20 pounds in 3 months) I took it one day at a time.
I was VERY surprised at how much I enjoyed the shred. Usually, I look for things I can do to great music, like dancing. Before I did this DVD I kept in shape by doing dance (like zumba type or ""Just Dance"". I usually hate aerobic DVD's with the cheap porno-esque music in the background (be forwarned-this DVD has that!) I have pretty much never done weight training in my life! But I sincerely looked forward to this everyday. Something about it- like the counting really appealed to me. Like I just have to get through 2 minutes of cardio until we change activity... it was challenging in a different way. I talked outloud to myself!
What Jillian says during workout 1 is true- if you're around day 6 or 7 you really can feel that your endurance and strength are improving. Your muscles stop aching everyday. Starting around day 12-15 I craved more! I felt so amazing and energetic after the workout (whereas after days 1-7 I felt like curling up in a ball and crying!)
I started out with 2 kilo weights (5 lbs) on day 15ish I felt that on many of the strength training exercises I could go up and use heavier weights.
I sweat a lot and actually liked it. At the end it felt like I had really worked hard.

I moved on slowly. I did do workout 2 once in the beginning and ""regretted"" it as it was for the most part too hard for me, BUT that said, I took the bits and pieces from it that I did like, to mix up work out one.
Some people said- should I do this workout 2x a day? I moved up slowly. The workout is 3 sets of 3 min strength, 2 min cardio, and 1 min abs... around day 10 I started doing 4 sets. On days I felt good I added low impact cardio at another time during the day- walking, or dancing.
I went away for the weekend and was able to keep doing the shred without the DVD in my in-laws basement!!!

Something that helped for me was counting how many reps I was doing (usully in workout 1 it is about 15 for strength and maybe 30 for cardio i.e. 30 jumping jacks or 15 bicep curls) counting how many I had left was easier than trying to watch the clock for 30 seconds or just waiting for Jillian to say 2 more!
After while I was able to shut off Jillian's voice (there is an option for that) and just focus on doing my moves correctly.

On a few days in the beginning I did 'injure' myself- I have a bad knee, and a bad shoulder from years of swimming- so on the days after that I adapted the workout but kept doing it, stayed off the bad knee, or didn't push the shoulder that was hurting, and usually recovered from the pain within a day and was able to continue. It is almost important to stay focused and do all the moves correctly, make sure your feet are grounded because you can easily hurt and ankle.
I also have a herniated disc in my lower back so was very careful to adapt some of the exercises- for example I can't do the lower ab reps that lift the pelvis off the ground so I replace that part with something more low impact for my back that still works my abs.
Because of my back, in workout 2 for example, I pause the DVD and take some of the exercises slower in the beginning to make sure I am doing them correclty and doing controlled movements.

Around day 20 I was flipping through the calendar and saw that I only had about a week left before the end of my goal to do it for 30 consecutive days.... couldn't believe it! Wasn't counting anymore. My muscles are bulging!

30 days now and I'm not stopping!
I've lost nearly 10 pounds in a month, pretty darn good!",1365552000,6,4470,4.0877993158494865

On the days where I didn't want to turn on the dvd (when I was in the last few days of a level), I had pretty much memorized the dvd so I would do the workout on my own using a timer for all the exercises.

I started 30 Day Shred on 25th February 2013.  Sometimes I incorporated Killer Buns and Thighs and completed 25 out of the 30 days.  There was no major change to my diet apart from not eating after 6pm.  My results after Level 1 are that I lost 10lb and 11 inches.  I am a 50 year old and have 4 stone to lose, so another 3 stone and 4lb to go.  I started Level 2 on 26th March 2013 for a few days and realised I'm not at that level of fitness yet, so I've gone back to Level 1 and this is my 13th day!!!  My weight and inch loss may be down to the fact that I have a lot still left to lose but I also see my level of fitness has increased and I have muscle tone and strength.  I paid 11 for both DVD's and if I never use them again, it was the best 11 I have ever spent.  Hail to Jillian :-) :-)",1365465600,,1054,3.7545454545454544
3085142,4,B00127RAJY,"After years of going to the gym and slaving on the elliptical or bike for an hour at a time and not seeing any impressive results or improvements in fitness, I'm a complete convert to the short but intense workout! Like Jillian says, if you want a short workout, you don't get to take breaks. But I'd rather spend 25 minutes a day

Pros:
This is a great DVD because it's affordable, has three levels and requires very little equipment (just hand weights and a mat if your floor isn't carpeted). Jillian uses compound moves (exercising multiple muscle groups at one time) so you see overall improvement in less time. She also uses circuits of strength, cardio and abs to keep things interesting.

Cons:
I started this with the intention of doing it for 30 days, but by the fourth day of Level 1, I found I was getting bored of the routine. Suggestions to get around this is to switch up the three levels (following the modifications for harder levels) or integrating other DVDs by Jillian or others into your routine.

Overall though I recommend this to anyone, from beginners to regular exercisers. Jillian is tough but encouraging and the routines are challenging but doable!",1365379200,,1176,4.699029126213592
3085143,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout. It's not long and if you can muscle through the 24 minutes of it, you'll certainly feel it the next day.

As Jillian says, you can't take it easy and expect results from a 24 minute DVD!",1365379200,,337,3.9705882352941178
3085144,4,B00127RAJY,"This is my second Jillian DVD and I echo other reviews regarding the intensity of the workout in a 20 minute window - it is great.  I have never had knee problems and these workouts are very hard on the knees.  Even being careful with form, something went 'pop' doing simple jumping jacks a few days in!  Am sure the knee was stressed from unusual activity...

Also, silly note, but:  This DVD has a menu at the beginning.  Our DVD player remote is long gone so I could not navigate to play the workout....ended up watching it in YouTube.",1365379200,,538,4.383838383838384
3085165,5,B00127RAJY,"Absolutely loving this workout program.  This is the first Jillian Michaels workout video I have purchased and actually used or haven't quit because of boredom in a few days.  I am currently finishing up level 2 today (so I haven't even looked at level 3 yet) but I already have lost 3 to 4 inches and my muscle tone is really starting to gain some sculpted aspects.  I will say I am quite tall and lean for a female to begin with at 5'11"" and around 150 pounds.  (I purposely haven't kept track of my weight for this program, since weight isn't what matters to me).  I have always been athletic and athletically built throughout my entire life, but with a full time career and classes the last 4 to 5 years, I haven't had time to keep up with my physical activity at all.  Since I haven't been active for awhile, the first  3 days were rough, but after that your endurance really starts to pick up.  I also kept with  a 5 days a week workout schedule for this.  I still have two days of the week I CANNOT fit a workout into.

After just level one and level two on that schedule there was a huge difference in my waist, hips and belly.  My belly (while not gnarly ripped) is completely smoothed down and I no longer have that little pudge at the bottom of my abs.  I even actually have some side obliques that are starting to show some definition.  (Never had those before!)  My little muffin top is also completely smoothed out along my waist and hips.  I literally think I may need to go down a size already.  I can also tell quite a huge difference in my back tightening up and not showing those ""bra lines"" from gaining a few pounds.  I even have some lightly defined biceps and triceps developing again!  However I will say I don't see as drastic changes in my legs or rear end.  I can tell they are much stronger and tighter though.

Overall, I feel better, I look better, clothes are fitting better and I just feel energized each morning to start my day after this workout.  Jillian isn't annoying or overly overbearing.  She is motivating with out saying the same thing over, however by day 10 your look forward to a different routine and new narration!  This is a workout routine where I have heard a few individuals say they did not get any results and I don't believe they really, REALLY, tried to keep things challenging.  If you are following along with the hard level backup guide or Jillian it truly is a quick decently hard workout.

I like doing 2 or 3 wourkouts at once. Doing only one workout is not enough for me. I like spending 60min during a workout.

I like the DVD menu. For example, if you finish level 1, you can go to level 2, and the dvd menu allows you to skip the warm up and go straight to the workout. That is a good feature for those trying to do more than one routine.

I am not sure what sparked me to buy her video (I don't watch The Biggest Loser), but I am so happy that I did and have since purchased her other workout videos. I feel great, feel my body changing, and I am so much happier.

I like that you only need hand weights and a mat, as opposed to P90X (I injured myself in a ludicrously absurd way) and the Brazilian Butt Lift video (the instructor comes off like an idiot and the workouts are boring).

I rub my knees with a little menthol oil after each workout as I can feel them and want to prevent inflammation.

This is the only workout that makes me look forward to the jumping jacks (to catch my breath!)

The big pros are the price and the fact that for only 20 minutes per day, nobody can find an excuse strong enough not to do it.

I still only exercise 2-3 times per week, but the time I spend doing this video is having a much better impact than my gym time was.  While I found even level 1 intense when I first started, Jillian has two other women with her in the video - one doing a harder version of each exercise, and one doing an easier version, so even beginners can do this video.

I also really like the ""patter"" that Jillian gives during the video. Good motivational chatter. My one complaint is that she uses the word a$$ - since I am doing this video at home, often with my kids in earshot, I wish she would have kept it totally clean. Swear words are totally unnecessary.

The 3-2-1 system (strength, cardio, and abs) is very time effective and makes the workout flow well. It seems shorter than it is, and it's already short.

3085233,3,B00127RAJY,"I don't consider myself a work-out fanatic by any means, but I am in good shape and work out pretty intensely 5-6 times a week.  I have been doing so for about 10 years.  With two very small children, I can't make it to the gym, so I do work-out videos at home daily.  This was the first video I tried after the birth of my first child.  For me, even just a couple weeks after giving birth, it was way too easy and not enough of a burn.  I would bundle work out 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 1 and 3 to even feel like I was getting a work-out.  None of these work-outs made me sore.  For people who are used to being more physically active and looking for somewhat of a challenge, I would suggest instead trying No More Trouble Zones or Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  If you're looking for a really challenging work-out, try Killer Buns and Thighs.  I think Jillian is a great trainer, but this one is just too wimpy for me!",1364774400,,915,4.011049723756906
3085234,5,B00127RAJY,"I have not been physically active in years.  Purchased this and have been doing it faithfully for over 3 months, doesn't take a long time and really gives a great workout.  Am almost ready for level 2.  Couldn't say enough good about this video, was a great one for me to begin with in my quest to gain my health back and lose weight.",1364774400,3,334,4.1875
3085255,4,B00127RAJY,"I have been working out on a consistent basis for many years. I 6 hour hikes up steep terrain with no problems. I work out in the gym, etc. I therefore thought this would be very easy. I guess it was the lunges/squats that got me as I'm not used to doing them. The day after doing this I could barely walk.  I am on day two post-work out and still hobbling around. I think that part of the problem is that I only had 8 pound weights and that is too much to use in conjunction with aerobic style moves/lunges.  I am going to go out and buy 3 and 5 pound weights.  I'm looking forward to climbing back in to the saddle again tomorrow.",1364774400,4,632,4.0
3085256,5,B00127RAJY,"I absolutely love this workout! I did the first phase for a week and then moved on. really works the core and tones! Its 20 min of your time, but you feel like you workout for an hour when you're done!!",1364774400,2,202,3.951219512195122

3085258,5,B00127RAJY,"About me: I am a 37-year old mother who had my two kids in my 30s. With the first one I developed hypothyroidism and so have trouble losing weight. I also have Diastasis Recti from my second baby and so can't do certain moves, like popping up from lying down on my back.

I LOVE this video! I cried through it the first time I did it, but quickly mastered Level 1. I started the video a week before Thanksgiving and did it three times a week to alleviate some of the heavy Holiday foods I knew I'd be eating, and I can honestly say that even eating tons of fatty foods for the six week holiday season I did not gain a single ounce - just from doing this video three times a week on Level 1.

Yes, it's difficult. And, because of my Diastasis Recti I can't fully do all of the ab exercises completely, but I simply do my best and do what I can. I cannot emphasize this enough: PROPER FORM IS IMPORTANT! And, GIVE YOURSELF A DAY TO REST BETWEEN WORKOUTS! Or, at least, do another workout video so you work different muscles.

In more than four months I've made it to Level 3 and feel great! Combined with eating better I've lost 12 pounds and I feel strong and healthy.

If you've absolutely never ever worked out before I recommend watching the entire video first and learning, either with a full-length mirror or investing in one session with a personal trainer, how to do proper squats and lunges. I, personally, do 10 minutes of my own yoga stretches first to open up my lower back and hips, which are very tight as a result of my weak abdominal muscles from Diastasis Recti. This helps me, but also I've worked out in the past and know how to do lunges and squats properly.

Like all other exercise, you get out of it what you put into it. If you phone it in you won't get results. If you try your best and push yourself you'll soon feel ready to move up to other levels.",1364774400,2,1874,4.20891364902507

Why is that necessary, exactly?  I can understand having to do so the first time, but each time?  Really????  I am a busy person.  I don't have time to waste each morning on unnecessary none-sense.  Regardless of how effective her workout routine might be, because she doesn't respect my time, this is the first and last DVD I will purchase from her.  Period.",1364688000,,598,4.333333333333333

So I'm in decent shape, but nothing amazing. I skipped to Level 2, which was like Insanity lite, plus aggravatingly chipper commentary on how you should keep at it because jeans shopping omg!!! If you're trying to get what this video promises, do yourself a favor and invest in Insanity. It's hard but doable. This is lame.",1364515200,,484,4.574712643678161

I am 56 yrs old and have been walking 3-5 miles a day for the last year and have lost 10 lbs but I have come to a stand still until I started using this tape.  I still walk but have added this tape to my workout.  At first I couldn't get through the beginners workout but kept on using it each day and I am now up to the intermediate workout.

I started off level 1 for one week and I noticed a huge difference . While I haven't lost weight ( I refuse to believe its muscle gain because I haven't been doing it long enough to get that much muscle ) I look better and feel better. I can go up and down my dreadful stairs much better and I feel more confident. I just bought level two and I still love it. While on level 1 i look at the "" advanced girl "" and could do the moves on the advanced level, in level 2 I have to look at the "" weaker girl "" and go by that but that's how you push yourself. As far as Jillian goes, I used to be a big fan of biggest loser and have seen her at her worst , manner wise and I was happy with what I got. People want their trainers to be funny and cute and joke around and go on their paste, but that's not how you lose weight. Some people need a little star push and that is what needs to get done. Jillian is honest and as nice as it gets with her. I am beyond happy and can't wait to see more results",1364428800,,1137,3.683127572016461

3085317,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm a bit overweight but my main goal for wanting to exercise is to be fitter and healthier. I've never been a fit person, and the fact that I'm out of breath running after the bus despite only being 27 is an embarrassment. I tried exercising by going to the gym - it's expensive, time-consuming for travel, too many people hogging the machines. I tried jogging for a while, thinking I'll at least get cardio in - but I hate running in the daytime in front of a lot of people, the weather is hectic in my area, and running at night isn't safe either due to wildlife. This is when I decided to try the home workout DVDs. I only wanted to try the ones that had good reviews. First one I tried was P90X - I was traumatized for at least 6 months straight. 5 minutes of P90X led me to 2 weeks of burning, unbearable pain. I gave up on that one. Then I came across Jillian Michaels' DVDs, and it's a godsend. It is intensive enough without being overly intimidating. The first time I tried it, I did feel the burn and had about 3 days of intense leg pain. But I went back to it after a week's rest, and it worked out fine. Jillian is right in the DVD when she says ""your body will adapt."" I sometimes lose motivation, but I can always come back to it. Some people say she ""talks too much"" - that's what works for me, it's great motivation to push you through. I'm now able to run for the bus without losing my breath!

For people who have complained about knee injuries - I noticed that most, if not all of them, were already aware of their health problems/knee weakness - it just goes to show that if you already have major health problems, CONSULT A DOCTOR before starting any sort of diet/exercise programs. This cannot be stressed enough. I have low iron deficiency and I always talk to my doctor before starting any sort of diet/exercise regimes.",1364256000,,1845,4.271428571428571

One does a modified version, which is helpful for beginners. It took me almost a week to work up to being able to go through the whole 20 minutes, but she's right that change WILL happen fast. Among the things I appreciate about this workout is that you get occasional glimpses of the helpers cheating or wincing as they go through the moves. YES! Even hot, smiling Amazons with rippling abs get tired!  The only downside is that there's a lot of introduction/ads before you can access the main menu. Now, I just put it in 5 minutes before I want to start and keep the TV off. Otherwise, I highly recommend this.",1364256000,,782,4.468531468531468

I love her 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute ab circuits.  When you finish you feel like you have had a full body workout and you will be warmed up and sweating.

I found Level 2 to be the easiest of the three levels because it focuses on the plank pose and I found those moves to be more comfortable for me.  I find lunges to be the most difficult move for me to master.

The 30 Days consist of 10 days of each level, but I worked Level 1 until I could complete the non-modified version of all moves without pausing.  I think it took me 14 days!  But it felt great to kick Level 1's butt.

We are doing this video and it's amazing how in just three workouts we can tell it's working because we all feel BETTER in shape.  Very fun but challenging.  Since it's only 20 mins you feel like you can do it daily,1364256000,,327,3.8507462686567164
3085335,5,B00127RAJY,"Can I just say this:  WOW Jillian!  This is an amazing workout, especially when you consider that it is only 20 minutes.

Here's the thing - I am a habitual quitter in my workout and diet routines.  I started a very doable diet about 6 weeks ago and have actually stuck with it, but hit the plateau at 11 lbs.  I decided it was time to commit to working out, too, but I can't stand gyms.  All those skinny people just don't motivate me!

And then I found Jillian.  I should tell you that I have done level one of this DVD exactly twice.  Day one was when it was delivered.  I was SO excited.  I shut the door so hubby couldn't watch me bouncing around like a crazy person with breathing problems and popped that DVD in.  10 minutes in, and you are feeling the burn, my friend.  For someone not in shape at all, minutes 16 - 20 are PURE TORTURE.  I was so proud when I actually finished it.

Now, halfway through, Jillian mentions something about cutting out hours at the gym.  Pure talk, right?  Oh, no!  It is not!  The next morning, I could barely walk, my muscles were so tight.  A word to the wise:  if you are not a person who has worked out in 6 months, you may want to go to bed with a bottle of naproxen after this workout.  I hobbled through the day a little discourage because it had taken such a toll, but then I realized that I literally felt like I'd been at the gym 2 hours.  So I rested that day and came back to it.  And do you know what?  I was a little stiff when I started, but got right back into it and went through it with SO much more enthusiasm on day 2.

I have a rock hard stomach.  My thighs have some definition (like the old days), and I am seeing some nice cuts in my biceps and shoulders.  I am on my way, totally motivated, and back for the second edition:  EXTREME SHRED.  I can get through ANYTHING if it's just 20 minutes.  I could squeeze it in quickly and know I got an amazing workout.  Totally on a roll!  Don't hesitate, just do it.  It's not EASY, but it's doable.  Also excellent that she gives 3 levels, each with two versions:  beginner and advanced.  At the end of 30 days, I was doing Advanced level 3, but when I started, I couldn't even get through level 1, ""beginner"" without resting briefly here and there.

I am not a huge Biggest Loser fan, but I really like Jillian Michael's videos. She might be annoying to some people at times, but I have done tons of workout videos and have never seen one that doesn't have a review criticizing the ""annoying"" instructor.

I did not like how it is 30 days. I do it every 2-3 days. I will weight lift and do yoga more than this video, only because it is strenuous, but you need to give your muscles a break. This work out is perfect. If you feel like you cannot do a lot, then don't. Just build up the muscles and then go for it. I made the video last 3 months instead of 30 days.

I have knee injuries and this work out kicks my butt (in a good way) without KILLING my knees. Yet i have seen amazing results. I am so happy with this product.

3085343,3,B00127RAJY,"Jillian does a nice job coaching you through this video, and it's definitely true that you can do all her moves in your living room. I've been using this after shorter runs, when my calorie burning ability should technically be at it's highest. I'm still pretty doubtful that I would be shredded in 30 days. In fact, it's been 90. I'm in good shape, but I'm pretty sure doing this video alone would not do the trick.

The workouts have good variation and are challenging enough, in my opinion. I like that it's not dependent on lifting heavy weights, but rather on reps. It feels like a real workout, even though it is short. But like I said, I've been doing it on top of a pretty serious running schedule, and I find her ""cardio"" annoying. I would like this video a lot better if she tossed the cardio and added the extra time to abs.

In short, this is good as workout videos go. I really like Jillian's style and will probably purchase more of her workouts. In fact, I'm surprised to hear her referred to as ""tough"". She seems pretty approachable and encouraging to me.",1364083200,,1072,4.436548223350254

It's extremely annoying and when you buy a dvd, you should be able to peruse through it to get to where you want to start.  Again, very annoying.  workout is excellent.  Jillian - you need to shut out the advertisements.. I won't buy again.",1364083200,,575,4.247706422018348
3085375,5,B00127RAJY,"Get this DVD, get it, get it now! I can't say enough about this DVD. Jillian suggests doing each of the 3 levels for 10 days each to get shredded in 30 days. I wanted to complete the program before I put in my two cents. So let me start by saying, I followed the program, 10 days on each level, 30 days with no rest days.

I am also on Weight Watchers and I follow the program closely, this DVD (no DVD) will help if you don't couple it with a healthy, light diet. I lost 9 pounds during the month I did it, I would have lost more I think, but I'm breastfeeding, so I'm careful not to lost more than 2 pounds a week.

There's a lot of leg work in this DVD, lots of lunges, squats and jumping, so if you have knee troubles be careful. Don't be completely discouraged however, I have some knee trouble too, but I was careful to do the moves properly as Jillian explained and when I needed to I did them slowly to keep the right form. I made it through the entire program without any serious knee pain.

That said, I was sore, many times, I felt muscles I didn't know about, but it was the good I-worked-out-hard-today kind of sore. There were times I wanted to quit doing lunges, but I would look down and see how defined my thighs were becoming. When I wanted to get the hell out of plank position I would notice how ripped my arms were becoming and I would keep going.

This DVD is challenging and effective. It's 25 minutes a day, it's $7.99 or less if you do the instant DVD (which I did) and it works. Just buy it and do the workout. If you eat right and do the DVD, you will get results.",1364083200,3,1591,4.041269841269841
3085376,5,B00127RAJY,I use it almost every day. It is tailored to those just starting out but it is also good for those who have a different intensity level. I don't like the music they play so I mute the video and play my own music.,1363996800,,212,3.840909090909091
3085377,1,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels acts like a drill sergeant. She constantly barks orders and demands that the person trying to keep up doesn't stop. She even makes an insulting comment about how she has 400 pound people doing this so we can do it and there's no excuses to not work out.
The pace of the video was intense. I did the beginning work out and was so sore I could barely get out of bed the next day. I forced myself to go into work and I had such a hard time walking around my classroom that I had to keep sitting down, which is not a good thing to do. My whole entire body hurt so bad, but my friends said no pain no gain so I tried it again. Could get past the first few min because the pain was so excruciating. I am not a whimp when it come to pain. I usually don't take anything if something hurts, but after this video I was in almost the worst pain in my life.",1363996800,3,862,3.9314285714285715

3085379,2,B00127RAJY,"I bought the 30-day Shred as a tool to take with me when traveling and staying in hotels.  The Level 1, 2, 3 is a great idea.  However, the inability to fast forward over the instructions and introductions is seriously frustrating.  When pressed for time (hello, the idea of 20-minute workouts was supposed to be for time pressed people...), having to sit through the same dialogue over and over again just gets annoying.

My fitness level is intermediate and I need to lose about 18lbs.  So, I'm not someone who is like on the Biggest Loser who needs to lose 50lbs+.  However, I found moving into Level 2 the plank positions and quick moves from standing to the planks was for people with a much higher fitness level.

I am disappointed in this product.",1363910400,,754,4.582089552238806

3085381,1,B00127RAJY,"I recently bought this dvd since I've used 'Bob's' Biggest Loser exercise videos and I've heard good reviews on this tape. However, suggesting a weight loss of 20 lbs in 30 days is irresponsible without basing this on how overweight a person is and without encouraging physician advice as this is very rapid weight loss. Further, I was quite dismayed at the notion that 'anyone' can do jumping jacks, including another reviewer with 'bad knees'. Whether or not you can do jumping jacks is not a function of how much you weigh. However, I have sever arthritis and one knee is reduced to bone on bone. So THIS 'anyone' has doctor's advice to not do standard jumping jacks or other high impact moves. I can walk in place and move my arms in the proper motion, but jumping and hard hits will place me back on crutches. I almost didn't buy the tape because I was so angry at the total nonsense and lack of judgement in this advice! Please consult your doctor's advice on what you can and can't do! Anyone who relys on this lady's questionable advice may do themselves real physical harm. Most people can find excercise they can do, but Bob's tape seems more reasonable on providing alternate moves for real needs.

______

Updates: I've watched the DVD I purchased. This is the worst exercise video I've ever purchased. Jillian's form is pathetic. Every once in a while, she throws in a comment about form and what not to do to that might cause injuries, but overall, good advice is missing. I winced watching the knees bending to the floor and extending far over the foot during lunges. The cardio is boring and nothing but jump rope and jumping jacks. This is not a tape for anyone with knee joint damage.

You will also have to stomach Jillian's endless noise of stressing and pushing the body. Yes, you must work hard to see results but you do not have to do high impact aerobics nor do you need to do the worst excuse for squats ever to be marketed to the public. Absolutely hideous and going in the trash.

The ONLY redeeming parts of the DVD are the ab workout segments. I know Jillian has faced critics and claims to have certifications to teach but that doesn't mean she is qualified or that she has any working knowledge of the body, joints, and proper exercise form. At least no knowledge is evident in her ridiculous claims of weight loss nor in her horrific examples of exercises. Please talk to your doctors and do a hard workout that doesn't hurt your joints!",1363737600,13,2469,4.5415730337078655

After going through all 30 Days and combining this workout, morning runs a few days a week, and eating a clean diet I noticed a lot of definition and strength.  I wasn't too crazy about the music and not being able to skip parts of the introduction, but that's not such a bad thing.  Some people have complained about repetitiveness in terms of doing the same level everyday for an extended period of time, but you can mix it up.  However, the advantage of doing the same level for a period of time is that you allow yourself to learn proper posture and build your strength depending on your level of fitness.

I want to feel better about me but I don't have time or money for a gym membership and I have heard wonderful things about the 30 day shred.  I did it this morning and wow!  Jillian worked my ass off!  I haven't worked this hard since high school track.  I made it through the whole session with maybe 3 five second breaks.  It's hard and I wanted to give up but I just kept thinking about future me.  Me without love handles and me with clothes that fit like they are supposed to.  By the end I just wanted to lay down but I kept walking around and did the dishes, swept the floor, and gathered laundry.  I feel like this was a good idea because I was still moving and my heart rate was lowering naturally instead of me just falling over. I will update this in a week and see how I am still doing.  Also, I used the tip to use canned goods instead of weights and I felt like this was a good substitute. I will invest in some weights when I have kept this up for a few weeks.

Don't ge me wrong, you are constantly moving and it will kick you butt for that 25 minutes!!  It's the only workout video that I actually looked forward to doing every morning at 6 am and felt extremely guilty for missing it (Lord knows, I have plenty to chose from).

I'm still panting and sweating after I do the level one workout so I will keep at this level for at least a few more days.
Jillian can sound a little annoying at times, but for the most part her instructions help me to push through the workout.

What I dislike is her opening description that is part of the root menu so I can't fast forward through it.",1362960000,,523,4.058252427184466

Do the forms as she said or duh you will have hurt knees or back. My knees started hurting but then I noticed I wasn't doing the lunges correctly to begin with so I fixed it. As for results can't say yet, just started but overall I like it!",1362960000,,551,4.158878504672897

I don't like to work out to begin with and definitely need to push myself to do so.  When I saw this DVD, I figured I'd give it a try. It was only 30 minutes, if that, and I was able to do it first thing in the morning before I leave for work.  My goal was to have energy got my long days but I always wanted to lose some weight and get toned.  I have to say I was able to accomplish all 3 goals with this DVD, along with eating right and taking vitamins daily.

So I tried it for 30 days, lost 10lbs and was able to maximize my energy for the day.  I did it about 3-4 times a week on average, 2-3 days I would just use the treadmill, and have one day's rest.

I liked the circuits the DVD offered between strength, cardio and abs.  They show the exercise routine for beginners and for other's that are more advanced. Out of all 3 workout routines, the 2nd was my least favorite, it required more coordination than the other two videos and I'm not that coordinated to begin with.  So I pretty much skipped it and went to the 3rd workout, which was my favorite of them all.

Great DVD, I was skeptical but I definitely saw the results.",1362873600,2,1317,3.973384030418251

I downloaded this to my computer because for $4.99, what could I loose (I mean other than lbs)?! I've never tried a JM workout before, but I've been a fan of her on the BL since the beginning! Boy does she deliver! I'm a hefty gal at 5'2"" and 198 lbs, however to say I'm completely sedentary would be inaccurate. I'm 21 years old and work at a restaurant where I'm constantly buzzing about, hauling silverware, ceramic plates, ice buckets, and pushing towering cup racks. Of course to say I'm in any type of athletic shape is unfair too, but I want to make it clear that I don't sit at desk. So grossly overweight, armed with only an old yoga mat, I attempted this workout yesterday and made it out on the other side alive. I had to take a few brief breaks, tried to keep 'em less than 5 seconds like Jillian said, but I never became discouraged or quit. I think it probably helped that I didn't have weights the first day, as it kept pressure off my unconditioned chest. Sweaty and gross after completing the workout, I ran upstairs for a quick shower. The entire rest of the day I was bouncing with energy, and I didn't feel sore in the slightest. Of course I felt quite different this morning! Every muscle ached upon waking an hour ago. Almost decided not to do the workout again, because I have a double today at the restaurant and know I'm going to be tired. But then I thought, hey, 30 days ain't nothing. If I choose, yesterday could be the day I changed it all. So I put JM on. And I thought I wouldn't make it through the first circuit. But I did, albeit I struggled through soreness with the strength training (I went out and bought 3 lb dumbbells yesterday). And then I breezed through the last two circuits. Okay. So maybe not breezed. But I made it through the cardio without breaking, and that's HUGE for a little lifetime asthmatic like me. I've made it my mission to do this for 30 days, 10 days of each level. Perhaps around day 15 and definitely at day 30 I'll revise this with an update of what I hope will be great results!

A friend of mine had lost TONS of weight after just 30 days. Like literally went from being pretty big to a teeny tiny 3! I was amazed and ordered this asap. I, unfortunately, am not in shape. I literally despise working out. After doing this the first night I thought I was going to DIE. I tried so hard to keep up. I even went along with the ""beginner"" instructor, and absolutely could not stay with her. I had to take so many breaks along the way that Jillian tells you not to do! I am going to admit I only did the video about three or four times before giving up. It was just way too much for me to push myself to do. I don't have the motivation or will power to go through with the full 30 days. Since ordering the DVD I have also gained even more weight...wish I could make myself do it...but it really is a rough workout. If you stay with it though, my friend is proof it will give you amazing results!",1362700800,,1060,3.9812206572769955

Also, Jillian stops to comment and correct and I find it very irritating and stop because I think the reps are done with.  Also, it seems like you are encouraged to do this every day for thirty days and I think I was experiencing injuries from it.  Use The Firm or Jackie Warner circuit training instead.",1362700800,8,442,4.301204819277109

I knew I needed to do some interval training and heard good things about this workout.  Since it's available on y o u tube for free I thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't think the workout was that hard but I've already noticed results.  I like the fact that it's only 20 minutes which is a realistic amount of time that anyone can commit to exercising.

I was looking for something that would give me some good cardio and core exercise, but didn't take too long and that I could do at home (I have two little boys who don't make it easy to get to the gym).  I asked around on Facebook and the first 5 comments I got were to recommend this workout program, and then I had even more endorsements after that.  I've been doing this workout since last week and I can tell you I'm already feeling a difference.  The first few days my quads burned SO bad and I had a hard time going up and down stairs.  But now I can do it without too much difficulty and I can feel my endurance building.  I haven't yet added hand weights but I'm about ready to start.

I'm definitely still in the beginner's range, but I notice a huge change in what I'm able to do in the past month. With three different levels, I like being able to switch things up.

This is a great, fast at home workout that gets you seriously sweating and pushes you to the limit -- amazing considering how short it is. This is my first Jillian Michaels product and I am already going to buy more of her DVDs. My only complaint is that when you first put the DVD in, it takes a while to get to the actual exercising, and there is no way to fastforward through the filler in the beginning. Since I generally do the DVD in the morning, I now pop it in, go brush my teeth, put on my shoes, get some water, etc, and it is ready to go by the time I am back in the room.

I started 30DS on Ash Wednesday and committed to completing it for Lent (which is more than 30 days). My goal was to lose 15 lbs and be back where I was one year ago (135 lbs). However, at the rate at which I'm losing inches, I may have to just settle for being my old size instead of my old weight!

I've really only lost 3 lbs as at the end of week 2, but my thighs are significantly slimmer and so is my torso. I'm still not seeing much progress in the waist area, but I still have a week and a half to go. I also plan to start with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism (BFBM) right after I'm done with 30DS so I can get enough cardio to really burn those problem areas.

I'll be back at the end of 30 days to update on my progress, but I definitely recommend this DVD to anybody who's serious about slimming down, toning up and losing weight.",1362268800,4,979,4.067357512953368

Level 3 really is no joke.  She has some workout moves in this dvd that I've never seen before.  They are all about working more than one muscle group at a time.  There is also a beginner to watch, so if you're not in the best shape or you've had an injury you can follow her.  I would recommend this dvd to people of all fitness levels.",1362268800,,603,4.0

I am doing this work out so I can at least jump start my weightlost and build my intensity for insanity! Don't get me wrong there are 3 Levels to this work out and the first one starts off hard because there's no stoping and your working your body hard, today will be Day 3 on level 1, I all do this for another 7 days, then do level 2 for 10 days and level 3 for the last 10 days, I hope to lose at least 10 pounds..

I am in decent shape but recovering from a back injury which helped me put on an extra 10 pounds over the past few years.  This workout kicked my butt and I have already lost some body fat.  I love her workouts and that is why I am so disappointed in the website (jillianmichaels.com).  I thought I was able to create a login to check out her sight for free and I denied any charges and/or upgrades.  I honestly don't remember giving them my credit card and the card they charged has been sitting in a drawer for 6 months...I was charged on 2/2/13.  When I disputed the charge with jillianmichaels.com they refused to refund me.  I explained I would never have agreed to this because I am in school full time and not working so I could not afford this at all.  I looked at the site once and never went back.  Honestly, not sure what they are charging $52 a quarter for exactly..so I can log my food and exercise?  Myfitnesspal app does that better and for free.  She does give you some meal recommendations but I am a dietetics major and a vegetarian so those were of no interest to me.  The site may be a great resource for some but just not for me.  Just beware that there is a charge and you have to email them or call them to cancel, there is no way to simply do it from the website.  I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did.

So only opportunity is exercise at home. Only after first week using the DVD my hubby said that my butt got firmer , LOL! I'm using second level now and I feel my body is getting stronger and leaner.
I got this DVD only to get my body stronger and leaner, because 6 month ago I gave birth to my baby and I lost the baby weight already :)
Overall, great DVD, but I am not sure if it is possible to lose all the weight it says, because I'm 5'7 and weight 122 lb ( same as pre-baby), so I don't need to loose too much weight, only to gain strength and get my belly and bottom back in shape....

The first workout wasn't what I was expecting. Kind of expected to feel dead by the end of it rather than feeling energized and ready for more. Lol
Its over before you know it!

I'm not in the worst shape, but then again I'm active duty military,  so I kind of have to
Stay in decent shape.
I bought some 3 lb weights to go with it. I think I need 5lb weights when I start level 2.

That being said, I'm still a weakling and hate doing exercise. Running is my enemy. Lol

Level one of this video is a great way to start. It will keep your ego up while you build back strength and energy that you lost from being lazy for a year.
Level 2 will probably kick my ass. And I'm looking forward to it :)

I bought this with the yoga meltdown so I could alternate days so I wouldn't get tired of doing the SAME thing everyday.
I will try the YM tomorrow. It gets pretty good reviews as well.",1361923200,,982,4.01025641025641

I don't mind walking the dog around the block but anything with weights?  Forget it. If I can do this, anyone can. It's not easy but it's only 27 minutes so definitely doable! Just press play! Once it's over you will be glad you did it! I actually gained 1.4 pounds while doing this (was already at goal weight) but I lost a pant size!

The sequence is good, I like the cardio, strength and abs split but the getting up and down is annoying for a person like me who is not that mobile yet.

It was definitely doable for motivated beginners (as another reviewer put it), but I was sore for a day or two afterwards. It definitely gets your heart rate up and your muscles going in a way that you don't get on the treadmill or elliptical at the gym, pushing you out of your comfort zone. Switch up the lessons on different days to avoid boredom.

You do need a set of hand weights (if you're just starting out, don't be fooled by how light 2 or 3 pound weights feel at the store--you'll be doing plenty of reps with them, and they feel heavy fast. Save the heavier weights for later in your fitness journey) and a mat, but that's it. I love that it's minimal and doesn't require you to shell out much extra money.",1361836800,,806,4.233766233766234
3085716,5,B00127RAJY,"Wow!  This is a great workout!  I believe doing this dvd every day helps get me ready for the day and for the next work out.  I'm 48 so I started sort of with low impact, I try to throw in high impact as much as possible.  I have to keep in mind, don't push it to the point of hurting yourself because then you won't be able to do it again for awhile.  The first 10 days of Level 1, I felt so great.  By the 4th day, I was doing high impact.  By the 7th day I could feel my strength building on the workouts.  Now I'm 6 days in to Level 2 and I feel so much stronger.  I know I'll finish this and then I'll start over.  When I start over, I'll make the workouts more high impact, I'll push myself harder.  I'll go lower on the push ups, I'll reach higher on the sit ups, etc.  I'm sore, not a painful sore, a worked sore.  I feel great.  I have more energy.  I'm too tired to snack - lol!

My husband says he definitely sees definition in my sides.  I am also doing weight lifting 3x a week at home, free style.  I also am using a variety of Jillians other dvds on the days that I don't lift weights.  So, for instance today, I did the 30 day Shred this morning and then lifted weights for 2 hours - then I'll go walking after work.  Tomorrow, 30 days shred and then Jillian's 6 Week 6 Pack, Thurs will be 30 Day Shred and then Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, One of the weight training days, I also do the No More Trouble Zones.  I'd love to have all her dvd's.  I just don't know when I'd work them in right now.

Keep bringing the great workouts Jillian!

Update:  Mar. 6, 2013:  I'm on Level 3 now:  I spent the past couple days with a virus (I believe) which attacked the muscles.  It didn't help that I worked out everyday - hard - for 7 days straight and didn't take a day off. I tried to lift weights, too sore and too tired to stick with it.

Wednesday, today, I did Level 3 of 30 Day Shred but at the lowest level you can imagine. For instance, walking planks were done on my knees including the traveling push ups, the jump squats and rock star jumps were just getting my feet off the ground so basically a low level jump rope effort, (lol) scissor crunches involved my feet higher in the air - instead of a few inches from the ground, I was able to do the alternating punches holding dumbbells in the squat position, the butt kicks with dumbbells was basically getting my feet off the ground - bending my knees just hurts while jumping (hence, achy muscles) - I feel bruised still from the virus, the alternating jumping lunges were just low level lunging forward and back. It felt like it went quickly.

I'm glad I did it - I worked up a sweat - I'm going to do a walking dvd next. Instead of spending 10 days on level 3 I believe I'll spend 13 due to the virus making me do it at such a low impact. I'm glad I did it!",1361750400,2,2828,3.9982142857142855
3085717,5,B00127RAJY,Great workout for all levels of fittness. I got bored with the lower levels even though I wasn't fit enough to move on to the higher level but I tried it anyway and there is a low impact version of all three levels.,1361750400,,215,4.023255813953488
3085718,2,B00127RAJY,"Any CONSISTENT exercise, especially for someone who does not already exercise much, will make you lose weight.  For this reason, doing this video for 30 days straight would certainly make people lose weight and get stronger.  However, for a person to stay fit for good, a person needs to exercise not just for 30 days, but for a lifetime, and this video would not encourage me to do that.

Every step of the way, Michaels urges viewers to do her workout so that they can ""change"" their bodies.  She continually points to her two assistants, women who are very muscular and who have very little body fat, and says things like: ""Look at her abs.  You want abs like that?  Do this exercise.""  Or: ""See that crease above her butt?  Hot, right?  If you want that, do this exercise.""

But these are lies, and they're harmful lies.  Will your body ""change"" from doing this workout video for 30 days?  Sure, sort of.  You'll lose some weight.  You'll gain some muscle.  But it will still be YOUR body.  You and I will never have that woman's abs or that other woman's butt crease, regardless of how much exercise or dieting we do.  Can we have stronger abs/butts than we currently do, with less fat on them?  Sure.  But they will still be our abs and our butts.

In level 3 of this video, Michaels says, ""If you've been doing this for 30 days, you should already be feeling that six-pack.""  Um, maybe if you already had one before you began her video regimen?  Let me tell you something.  I was a Division I college athlete for four years.  I ran 50 miles a week.  I did 9 minutes of abs with no rest every single day.  And ladies and gentlemen, I never had a six-pack.  Never.  Not once.  And that ""pouch"" at the bottom of your stomach that Michaels assures you her workout will help you get rid of?  Even at my fittest, I always had it.  Why?  Because that's how my body was designed.  And you know what else?  I'm FINE with that.  I love my body.  I don't need a six-pack to love my body and to be beautiful, and neither do you.

If you're looking for a way to get in shape and stay motivated to work out past 30 days, find something that's fun to do and that makes you feel good about yourself.  Michaels will not make you feel good about yourself, and her workout is not particularly fun, or even convenient.  First of all, the workout requires hand weights.  Most people do not already have hand weights in all of the different sizes that would be necessary to reflect the gains in strength that they would make over time, so this is an added expense/inconvenience.  Michaels also relies on standard, run-of-the-mill exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and jumping jacks, so that even hardcore workers-outers will not be particularly inspired by her.  I was able to do all three levels back to back, and all I got from it was pissed off.

Her view of exercise is that the only reason you would want to be doing it would be to get ""hot.""  She insists that pain is gain and that the harder you work, the more attractive you'll get.  Though this could be effective motivation in the short term (let's say, for 30 days), it's not sustainable in the long run.  I would highly advise the beginners among you to find a more positive instructor who doesn't make false promises and encourage you to dislike your body (try Juliane Arney), and the advanced workers-outers among you to find a more challenging video, also with a more positive instructor who doesn't make false promises and encourage you to dislike your body.  (I don't particularly like Billy Blanks's style of instruction, but his advanced Tae-Bo workouts kill me.  I've also heard good things about the challenge level of P90-X, though I've never done it, and it does look expensive.)",1361664000,3,3737,4.4992548435171384

3085722,5,B00127RAJY,"For someone who never writes reviews for ANY product, (but does read them) I feel compelled to comment/rave about this workout and I'm only on my 5th DAY of THE 30 DAY SHRED.

I am the mom of two small kids. In my late 30s. Tall and fairly thin, yes, but not in particularly great shape as I've not really EVER worked out consistently. I've had several opportunities to join beautiful gyms due to my past employers offering substantial discounts but never, ever stuck with it.

Now, with two small kids and so little time in my day for anything, no money for the gym, expensive yoga classes, or babysitters to cover me for either, I've done nothing for myself, including taking care of my body and I'm closing in on 40. After reading the thousand of raves for the 30 Day Shred, I thought, fine, what's there to lose, right?... but secretly wondering WHEN I would actually lose interest and give it up.

5 days in and for the first time in my life, I WANT TO KEEP DOING IT AND FEEL A CHANGE IN MY BODY ALREADY.

What makes it different for me?
The length of the workout. Above all else, for a mom whose job never ends, the short time commitment is paramount. You are DONE before you know it and you feel like you worked hard. I have yet to feel like bailing and skipping a day the way I almost certainly would if this were a 45-50 minute workout. I can't stress this enough. The length of the workout is akin to a shot of confidence -- once you've done it twice, you know you can easily do it again and again.

The length of each circuit, the change-up of the exercises, coupled with the 3 different levels, makes it perfect for beginners AND perfect for more the advanced. It's my 5th day in I have not felt like I absolutely can't power through a tough part watching Anita on level 1. AND I see great potential in doing the Natalie moves (more difficult) as I improve, coupled with the 3 different levels for even more challenge. Even on day 5 I am able to do deeper, more advanced versions of some exercises.

Jillian is a great coach. She knows what to say, how to say it instruction-wise and WHEN. Everything she offers to ensure you are doing a move correctly is spot-on. When she describes the knot in your abs during the very last part, she is reading your mind and that acknowledgment is a confidence booster. In other words, it all feels natural and is easy to follow -- a perfect balance of instruction and encouragement considering I read so many gripes about other videos and how 'this or that' is irritating.

If you are sitting on the couch looking for inspiration, please give the 30 Day Shred a try... I am only 5 days in and an enthusiastic convert!",1361491200,4,2666,4.352112676056338

I think it is a good use of my time, which is limited.

I wanted something I could do when she naps that would not wake her and that would be an efficient workout-this is that! I love it, it's very challenging yet its only 20 minutes.

The best thing I like about this video is the audio options -- once you know the workouts, you can switch off Jillian's voice and do the exercises simply to music.  While I find that  the workouts are do-able, just the right duration, and effective, there's something about Jillian's voice that makes it seem that she herself doesn't enjoy the workouts, that the whole process is painful for her (the ""no pain no gain"" philosophy I suppose).  Exercising and weight loss doesn't have to be painful.  I have used this and other workouts in conjunction with Weight Watchers and have lost an average of 6 pounds a month for the past 4 months.

I would describe myself as formerly athletic.  Currently moderately athletic (ran a half marathon in November, do some weights, some cardio) and 15 lbs over my ideal weight.  Even when I exercise consistently (like marathon/half marathon training), I have not been able to lose weight.

This DVD helped me lose 10 lbs over the holiday season, and I didn't try that hard (diet wise - I ate those Christmas cookies, no problem).  I completed 20 of the 30 prescribed days over December and January (20 workouts over 2 months).  I rotated the levels each day to avoid boredom.  The fact that it's over in 20-25 minutes meant it got done more consistently.  It also didn't leave me hungrier than usual (like running has).  And yet, I felt like I did get a workout in.  After the first 6 workouts, I noticed visible differences.  I've kept the weight off (again without trying hard) for almost two months now.

Jillian's combination of workouts will really make you sweat and work for the whole twenty minutes. As she says, ""If you think you are going to die, that is when it is working."" She does a great job of giving examples for beginners as well as advanced level workouts. Also, the fact that all you need is some hand weights (use canned food if you don't want to buy some) is great too. Although the three levels can get monotonous. just mixing up the levels on different days keeps the workout intensive and interactive. Overall, great quality for a great price. If you are looking for a great workout without having to pay for expensive gym membership and have little time to get in an effective run, I highly recommend this DVD.",1360281600,,831,4.437908496732026
3085846,5,B00127RAJY,"If you are willing to commit to doing this workout, you WILL see results. I have done this challenge twice and plan on doing it again soon. But here's a secret - I didn't do it in 30 days. It took me longer because I only did it 3-4 days a week. The other days of the week I walked and jogged. The important thing is that you're adding variety to your exercise routine. I completed 30 sessions, just not all on back-to-back days. Jillian would probably holler up in my face for saying this, but if doing 30 Day Shred over 30 non back-to-back sessions (but no less often than every other day) is a more realistic goal for you, I say do it that way.

My favorite thing about this workout is that on the first day, 30 seconds of jumping jacks may about kill you. But on workout 6 or 7, you notice it's getting better. Near the end of the challenge, 30 second of cardio isn't a picnic, but feels GREAT.",1360281600,2,898,4.131428571428572
3085847,5,B00127RAJY,I workout 6 days a week and love hitting weights hard. Some days you want to do something but don't have the time to do an hour workout. These quick 20 minute workouts are great. Super effective and you can make them as hard as you want by modifying or adding higher weights. LOVE,1360281600,,280,4.203703703703703
3085861,4,B00127RAJY,"For only a twenty minute workout, this video definitely gets your heart rate up. I'm in decent shape - I don't work out all the time, but I bike commute to work most days (used to be 8 miles roundtrip, now its 20 miles), walk, and hike often. My heart rate definitely is up within the first few minutes of the video and some of my less used muscles are protesting quite a bit by the end. I did level 1 once and have been doing level 2 a few times a week. I haven't tried level 3 yet, but plan to soon. I like that there are 3 different workouts so you can switch it up and by using heavier weights you can make some of the exercises more difficult. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I think if you want to see more drastic results you probably need to do one of the longer videos. But I like that it is only 20 minutes since I don't usually have a lot of extra time and it gets in a little time working my abs, arms, and other trouble areas/less used muscles.",1360281600,,970,3.9289340101522843

I think the ""old school"" feel of it, with jumping jacks and jumping rope is great, and she is very motivational.  I've done a lot of workouts.

Something I did not have. I also lost weight and inches. My clothes fit better, too. The shred is actually 27 minutes, but that's ok. It's still a short workout. Especially for those starting out. I like that the shred is based on Jillian's 3-2-1 system. 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. The workouts go by really fast. Each level is hard when you first begin, but gets better the more you do it. Doing the 30 Day Shred for a month got me into the habit of daily exercise which is a good thing. Jillian is no nonsense, but she gets the job done.

There are modified moves for those not as fit or new to exercise. Follow Anita, she does the modified moves whereas Natalie does the advanced moves.",1359849600,,881,4.152046783625731

Im still on workout one beginner on this and I'm telling ya, it kicked my butt!!! I definitely felt my heart rate go up!! I wouldnt say you would get all over toned from this, but I definitely think its great little cardio!

Im not able to skip the beginning, so it kinda has a slow start of the repeat but not too bad. She goes through pretty fast because there is no stopping during this 20 minutes",1359849600,,557,3.9732142857142856

I haven't done the 30 day straight challenge, but have been content to use the video every other day or if the weather outside prohibits me from leaving my home.

What I like:
1) The workouts are easy to learn and there are modified versions for almost every exercise.
2) The workouts are effective, challenging your muscles and heart. I never fail to hit target heart rate with this one.
3) The workouts are quick, warm up through cool down takes just under a half hour.
4) The workouts require limited equipment, all you need is hand weights.

Cons:
5) For an advanced exerciser, i.e. someone who eats, sleeps and breathes circuit training, this video might not be challenging enough.

It's day 3 and we are both so sore that moving is a chore, but we feel AMAZING. My energy is back again and I feel more awake and focused than I have in a while. It may only be day three, but just based off of how sore I am, I know the results are going to be amazing. I can't wait to get a few more of her DVDs now so we can keep going even after these 30 days are up. Jillian's attitude and the way she breaks down everything you're doing and the reasons behind it encourage you to keep up with this workout.

3085962,5,B00127RAJY,"Back in October 2012 I decided to make a lifestyle change by changing my eating habits and exercising to get in shape. I wanted to be healthy and look great at the same time! So I started making raw Green Juices/smoothies and recently I started incorporating more RAW meals into my life. I have lost 35 pounds thus far. I just purchased the 30 Day Shred and 10 minutes ago I just finished the fist workout. Let me tell you how great I feel (and by great I mean sore and limping). This tells me that I'm burning something and it is most likely fat! This workout gives me something that the treadmill can't give me and thats the feeling that my fat is melting away. I have twenty more pounds to go and I believe that working out to this daily will definitely get me there. I plan on using this in the morning and the Jillian Michaels Buns and Thighs DVD in the evening. I'll do the treadmill on the weekends. My plans are to get it off and keep it off FOREVER! This is a must have for your workout regimen! I'll definitely update in 30 days to let everyone know the 30 day results!

3085966,5,B00127RAJY,"i am 3 days into this series, and so far am enjoying it...as much as i hurt.  Jillian is tough, the workout is tough, but it goes quickly and she is personable enough that i don't think she will become annoying ...as some videos can.  She has a point - if you want to work out for only 20 minutes, it has to be a hard workout: every second must count.  i like the idea of switching between levels to keep the workout from being boring, and i like that she offers modifications so even higher levels can be attainable to keep it fresh and interesting.

3085968,2,B00127RAJY,"I did this program exactly as directed and lost zero weight. Level One is perfect for someone massively out of shape because it gets easier every few days. I moved to Level Two after a week but Three was too much for me as it wore on my spine. Jillian is motivating and not boring, and the idea that you are moving towards your goal is energizing. Until you reach the end with zero weight loss, zero sizes smaller, and just a temporarily higher endurance as the only change.
Other reviews show just how dangerous this is for your knees and spine. I had no idea! You may not care now, but trust me, when you can't work out AT ALL and can't work either and are home on the couch... you will gain more weight than you could imagine.

I stopped a few times during the workout but probably would have stopped all together if it weren't for Jillian. She did an AMAZING job of encouraging me to keep going. I am sweating and close to throwing up but feeling great for changing my body. The workout was over before I knew it. If it were any other trainer, I don't think I would have kept going. Jillian was the difference!",1358899200,,550,4.055045871559633
3085970,5,B00127RAJY,I have really begun to see a change in my body since beginning the workouts. This change has been faster than turbo jam and many of the others that I enjoy doing. I am seeing definition in my body all over and not just in one area...but it does make me not like her!,1358899200,,266,3.9444444444444446
3085971,5,B00127RAJY,"Pros:

- Great variety! 3 minutes of strength is broken up into 2 different movements, so it's not 3 straight minutes of static lunges with bicep curls (for example). Same with cardio...jumping jacks, then jump rope, jumping jacks, jump rope.
- 3 levels based on intensity
- Each level includes modifications until you've worked up enough strength to do the full movement
- No excuse not to do it when each workout is only 30 minutes, including warm up and cool down
- Having a trainer tell you what to do and how to do it every time makes it easy to commit to a workout
- You can feel a difference in your endurance and strength each time you work out. You know when you're ready for the next level, so there's no guessing ""is this working?""

Cons:

Each level is a routine--that is, level one is the same every time you do it. So if you're a beginner like me, you'll be insanely sore for the first 3 days and there is no break for those muscles--you do the same routine every day, even if your pecs and quads are killing you.

DVD menu: You can't skip past the intro to get to the main menu and start the exercise. Turn on the DVD player a few minutes before you're ready to work out so you don't have to sit and watch the same intro every time.

Audio: I wish there was an option for just Jillian's voice instruction without music, but instead, you can choose to hear the music without her instruction. You get tired of the same music every time. I'll blast some club music in the background, but I still need to keep the DVD volume loud enough to know when to switch moves (you're not always staring at the TV) and the DVD music interferes with what I want to listen to.",1358899200,2,1674,4.251572327044025
3085972,5,B00127RAJY,"I was kind of at the end of my rope, and knew I had to make some changes. Started slow by gradually weeding things out of my diet, but I knew I'd need to start working out.

I dreaded it so much.

I hate to exercise. My feet fall asleep due to vein issues (yes, even barefoot, so it's not tight shoes), I get overheated and faint, and I hate how I feel so weak and incapable. I can sit in a room and play clarinet for 5 hours at a time, but 20 minutes of cardio feels like hell on earth. I'm 39, in the overweight category of BMI, have 2 young kids, and the most exercise I usually get is chasing kids and a short walk to get the dog to poop. I knew it was going to be really hard to do, so when I finally broke mentally, I downloaded this, set up my 3 lb. weights, yoga mat, water and shoes, and bit the bullet.

I'm on day 2 of this, and I already love it. (I am so shocked!)

Day one was hard. I had to stop the playback several times to catch my breath, lay on the floor and put my feet above my head to get the blood flowing correctly again. I hated having to stop, when the cardio was only 3 minutes.  I was sore all over, but finally got that first exercise high I've heard about (that I never got, even when I'd do 90 minute high impact step aerobics back in the 90's.)

Day two was today, and it took a lot of mental gymnastics to get me to hit play (and some Advil. Still sore.) My goal was to get through with fewer stops. I MADE IT WITH NO STOPS AT ALL!!! I can't believe it myself! Yesterday, 20 minutes seemed interminable, and today I couldn't believe it when she said we were on the last circuit. I was convinced there had to be 5 more!

I feel better, stronger and healthier already. Though I hadn't watched her shows, I had heard bad things about JM, but I found her to be very positive and encouraging, without being a complete irritation (and her voice isn't nearly as annoying as some others. Denise Austin, for one, drives me up a tree.) I also love that she doesn't smile like an idiot through this and keeps saying, ""this is HARD."" Yes, it is. Thank you for acknowledging the fact!

If you're a beginner, and you're scared, give this a try. The instant download is a really good deal, and for me made it doable, knowing I can take my laptop anywhere to work out made it worth doing. And do it the next day, even though you're sore. You deserve it!

I feel so good, I think I'll treat myself to some new gym shoes. I think I'm going to need them! Thank you, Jillian!",1358899200,2,2489,4.022267206477733

3085977,3,B00127RAJY,I saw the many reviews and thought it would be a good workout because I just love Jillian Michaels.  I was prepared for a tough workout but nothing prepared me for what happened 5 minutes into the workout. I was doing lunges making sure I was in proper form. Basically that my knee was not over my toes. I am not sure what happened but next thing I know I topple over and my knee pops out of joint. No one else was home so I had to put it back in joint.  Very painful!!! Had to wear a knee brace. Took about 6 weeks to recover to the point where I could not rely on someone else to help me get up or where I could kneel on the floor without it hurting.

I then bought the jillian micheals 30 day shred.  I not only was able to maintain my weight during the winter but I became thinner because I was losing fat and building muscles.  Now I am 5 foot 2 inches, so 120 pounds looks like a litter more on my short stubby body but i feel as if im in great shape.  I am able to do things I was never able to do before.  Not all of this was because of Jillian I lost the weight from running and dieting, but I got in shape with Jillian.  Not to mention where I live November-March I would freeze outside running and I get bored with my tredmill.

I started doing this DVD last week, I'm still on Level 1. This DVD is tough but you can do it! The interval training is a proven method that I love - you don't get bored and you have to push yourself through. The DVD is split up into three Levels - 1,2 and 3. Each level contains three circuits and each circuit contains 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and a 1 minute of abs. The goal is to go through the workout that is a full 20 minutes WITHOUT stopping. I just now have gotten down to only taking two 5 seconds breaks and I""m super out of shape, so it really does help. I purchased 3 other Jillian DVDS after I got hers. I love them. You will see results if you do the exercises seriously, push yourself and keep up with it.

3085991,5,B00127RAJY,"After returning to work following the birth of my daughter, I had a couple of pretty sedentary weeks because it was really hard to find the time to exercise.  This video is a great solution.  I can do it after putting the baby to bed or sometimes even while she plays nearby.  I have been doing the first level.  I find the cardio and abs easy but the strength moves very challenging, probably because I did a lot of jogging during my first few months post-partum, but even with the not-too-tough cardio I do get a decent sweat going.  I'm interested to see if the cardio/ab circuits get much harder in levels 2 and 3, which would really make this an amazing workout.  Even level 1 is an awesome workout when combined with a short run first.  I like how straightforward the video is.  You hardly need any equipment (you could use 16 oz cans for weights in a pinch) and Jillian's technique cues are helpful.  There's no wondering if you're on the wrong foot or feeling like an idiot because the moves are too complex.  I'm so glad to have this option available for really busy days and I am looking forward to checking out some of Jillian's other videos.",1358035200,3,1153,4.421800947867299

3085997,5,B00127RAJY,"I am only two days in, so I can't accurately rate the results after 30 days yet, but this workout is fantastic.  It is HARD.  It's the hardest 20 minutes that I can remember ever working out.  I had a baby 4 months ago and have a lot of baby weight to lose.  This video is great.  Because it's only 20 minutes, I can wait until I put my baby to sleep at 8, and do this quick workout.  I don't have to miss any time with him by going to the gym.  After day 2, my arms, legs and ""abs"" hurt so bad - which is especially nice to feel this burn in my stomach where I need the most help.

I know a few other new moms that do this video and they say this was the only thing that helped with the baby belly.  This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.

This is perfect for any moms of small children who don't have time to go to the gym, or anyone who is under time constraints of any kind.

I should also mention that I am obviously only doing the beginner workout right now, and I can barely get through that.  I can only imagine how challenging the other two workouts are.  I am coming from pregnancy and being completely sedentary, but back in the day I used to workout a LOT, so I do think I know a good workout when I see one.

I definitely recommend giving this a try.  I will try to remember to update my review after I complete the 30 days.

I will say, the commentary at the beginning and the fact that you can't fast forward through it, is annoying as some other reviewers said.  My solution - turn on the DVD and hit play, then go get ""ready"" (fill up water, change clothes, put baby to bed).  By the time you come back, the commentary is over & you're ready to go.

3086011,5,B00127RAJY,Wow! this is the first of Jillian Micheals videos I have owned. I have ordered several more and I am awaiting their arrival now. This kicked my butt way more than a trip to the gym & i sure felt it the next day!,1357603200,,211,3.8181818181818183
3086012,5,B00127RAJY,"After two weeks of doing this video every day, my body is already beginning to change.  I have tried many, many exercise routines, but NONE have achieved the results that Jillian's video does.  All my friends are ordering it because they too can see the progress I have made.  Highly recommend this video.  Only 20 minutes a day!  What more can you ask for!",1357603200,3,357,4.515625
3086013,5,B00127RAJY,This is a great workout and in only 20 minutes!  combines weights and cardio.  The most bang for your buck!  I really like the 3 level workout.  You can choose your level.  It's a great start to the new year!,1357603200,,208,4.1
3086014,4,B00127RAJY,"Received DVD this morning and decided to get right on with it , did easier on level one and managed to keep up although as I have a hip problem so did march instead of doing all jumping jacks , thoroughly enjoyed it , I didn't feel like I had done 20 mins went very fast , and on the plus side even now two hours later still feeling like I've actually worked out :-) like having an easy and hard version as well and the fact that Jillian talks you through as some DVD's where they have two levels you just get told to watch .
Looking forward to doing it again tomorrow , have done weight and measurements so hoping to see some changes next week :-)",1357603200,,648,4.0310077519379846

3086017,5,B00127RAJY,A speedy and challenging workout which gets good results fast. She explains the exercises well and they are actually easy to do even for someone who's fairly uncoordinated. Fun workout. Would definintely recommend it!,1357430400,,217,5.411764705882353
3086018,4,B00127RAJY,"Jillian does not disappoint. I'd heard about the 30 day shred for years, and I finally got it. I workout otherwise, so I don't do this multiple times a week, but when I do, it's always a good workout. It's only 20 minutes, but you never stop moving. I've only made it through the first level so far... looking forward to the next challenge!",1357430400,,340,4.328125

3086021,5,B00127RAJY,"Amazing workout in half an hour (including warm up cool down and getting the dvd started).  If you stick to it you will see results within a week.  I did 24 days and loved the results.  One of my husbands friends commented on how strong I was when I helped unload boxes of ceramic tile.  You will notice the changes in yourself, each time you do the work out.  i could not do a regular push up at the beginning of my ""training"" and was so pleased to get the strength as I worked out.  be sure to push yourself, you might not know you can do it until you try.  I moved to the next level every 10 days, they do get harder!  I am trying to get my husband to use this!  Everyone can find 30 minutes and it is a great workout, you are done before you know it.",1357344000,,754,3.9078947368421053

3086024,5,B00127RAJY,"I used this DVD at the start of 2012. Before I ended up with my diagnosis of RA and Osetoarthritis in my spine. This workout really does work! I lost 14 inches on my body overall. I didn't lose a ton of weight in pounds, but the inches were amazing!! I love Jillian, so don't hesitate to use this workout.",1357171200,,305,4.1
3086025,5,B00127RAJY,"I fell in love/hate with Jillian because of this DVD! it's a killer workout, but I lost 20 lbs in 30 days, just by working out every day and eating smaller portions and cutting out most of the junk, but I still would treat myself every once in a while. I love this workout!",1357171200,4,273,4.074074074074074
3086026,5,B00127RAJY,"I am new to the workout scene - approaching 40 and I ""just haven't had time"" for all these years. It's an excuse a lot of people use, but it really is true. I truly do not know where I would find the extra time in a day or even in a week to change clothes, drive to a gym, do a workout, drive home, etc.  A co-worker mentioned that she just gets up a little earlier and works out at home and I had an epiphany. Why couldn't I do that?

So, for the last 3 months, I've been getting up 45 min-1 hour earlier and working out. I started with some DVDs I got at the local big box store - dance/aerobics/zumba type DVDs that were fun, but I found myself skipping some of the routines because they were just too long.

I did a search on Amazon and Jillian's videos popped up immediately. When I heard 20 minutes, I was eager to try it. I'm SO glad I did. The 30 Day Shred is not easy, but it's not so difficult that a beginner can't do it. The first time around I tried to progress to level 2 a little too quickly and ended up hurting my knee. I took a break over Thanksgiving, did some research about form, and started over. I often follow the beginner/modified assistant, but I am still seeing results and I feel great the whole day long.

I really like the structure of this workout. I also have some of the Biggest Loser DVDs, but they seem kind of loose and disorganized compared to 30 Day Shred. It's nice to see the Biggest Loser contestants doing the workouts and struggling (like me!) but I really like the professionals on Jillian's video so I know the right way to do the moves.

I have finished the 30 Day Shred (lost 7 pounds in 30 days!) and I've moved on to Ripped in 30, which is very similar. I was nervous about Ripped in 30 because I loved the 30 DS so much, but so far I like it a lot, too. If you are pressed for time (or even if you aren't) but you want to tone up and feel good, Jillian's videos are definitely the way to go.",1357171200,2,1941,4.018134715025907
3086027,5,B00127RAJY,This is a GREAT workout video.  It will definitely kick your butt and you will see results if you stick with it.  I need to start it again!,1357171200,,139,3.9285714285714284
3086028,3,B00127RAJY,"First of all, let me say that this is a good, sound workout.  If you're looking for something relatively short that will get your heart rate up and works most of your muscles this is a fine program.  You could do a lot worse.

My biggest gripe with the whole thing is the ""20 pounds in 30 days claim"".

I'm a 300 pound guy.  Out of shape yes, obese no.  I can still run a 30 minute 5k at my weight.  I burn about 300 calories doing this work out.  A pound of fat takes 3500 calories to burn off.  If I DIDN'T EAT FOR A MONTH I wouldn't lose 30 in a month, whether I did this program or not.  If you think you can get a 3500 calorie a day caloric deficit go for it.  But you can't.  Most people will burn about 200 calories doing this program, on top of a base rate of about 2000.  If you cut to a 1500 calorie a day diet you can expect to lose about 8 pounds in 30 days.

Don't let the outrageous claim turn you off, it's still a good program.  Just understand that it's impossible to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without going on a hunger strike.",1357171200,3,1044,3.881516587677725

The first two weeks I was working out on level 1 and 2, the rest of the month I was working out on level 2 and 3 back to back. I can see my body is toned. This DVD is amazing.

I have bought others before but never stuck to them for long, this one I know I will. I guess for the others that say it's pretty easy....I'm thinking they have to be in really great shape.  I love that it's quick, effective, how she talks thru the workout by giving you tips on proper form, and that there are 2 advance workouts included.  Like a previous reviewer stated, the first few minutes of the tape are a bit annoying.  I want to just get started and not listen, but I guess it's a way to promote other things.

Level 2 & Level 3 are serious butt kickers, and on mornings where I accidentally sleep in or have an early meeting, I can put this in for 20 minutes and I don't feel like a slug for the rest of the day (how I feel if I don't work out).

We are currently on day 3 and although the workouts are tough, we are feeling great! We already have more energy and are feeling better about ourselves. We are a great motivator for each other we hope for great results! Jillian is a great motivator and this workout is intense, but fabulous.

I am a nurse in a cardiac intensive care unit. I don't want to be a hypocrite and look at my patients after they have had open heart surgery and tell them they need to make some lifestyle changes when I haven't done them myself. I always told myself that I would never get to that point but I am heading there and fast. I'm hoping Jillian can help me lose the 3 pants I have gained since graduating nursing school 3 years ago so I can not only better take care of my patients, but be an example to them.

I will keep everyone posted on my progress as I continue this journey!

So, I am 2 weeks in to the 30 day shred. Since I have a history of knee problems I did level 1 for 2 weeks instead of 10 days and I always follow Anita in the exercises. Today started level 2 and although it is super tough, I still feel great!

I am not one for weighing myself, but I have gone down one pants size since starting. I love that I am seeing results but I feel even better because I feel better! I work night shift and always seem to be low on energy on my days off...that has definitely changed and I am definitely getting more accomplished on my days off!",1356393600,6,1576,4.107142857142857

3086081,3,B00127RAJY,"I bought these videos because I wanted to try and work out over my winter break--I wasn't expecting miracles in 30 days, but I trusted the name and liked that the videos were only 20-30 minutes so it wouldn't eat up too much time.

However, they are a bit too intense for me. I am in pretty bad shape, I am only 20 but I am overweight and I don't exercise very regularly at all. I was only able to get through the first workout for two days--they were pretty hard and I was sore after, but today my knees are in a lot of pain and keep giving out when I walk. I am hoping that the pain will subside in a few days and that I haven't given myself a long term injury. My own fault, I should have gone slower and paid more attention to my form, but still.

Pros:

-very short
-does provide a good workout
-exercises are straight forward and easy to follow
-good quality videos as far as pace, music, trainer commentary

Cons:

-not great for beginners
-doesn't spend enough time on each exercise to get the form right
-the commentary was very good at encouragement, but I feel like it made it seem like slowing down or modifying the exercises more was entirely unnecessary. Probably to make good on the 30 day claim, but not necessary for just improving overall fitness at a slower pace. Mostly my bad, just be careful not to hurt yourself if you aren't in the best shape.",1355875200,2,1367,4.262548262548263

I am now able to complete the first workout AND walk just fine the next day! I have noticed my endurance and stamina improving!

I am about 50 pounds overweight, and not naturally athletic! Infact, other than dancing in high school, I have always hated working out! But Jillian has such a good personality and she really pushes you and makes you think! Just when you want to give up, she tells you ""you can do it!"" ""If 400 pd people can do jumping jacks so can you!"" And that runs through my head each time I do them, because instead of getting tired and stopping I think that if they can do it so can I!!!

I can't wait to see where I am on day 30! :)

Jillian uses high intensity interval training which keeps you switching things up between cardio and muscle building so it's never boring. This video has three levels, level one is great for beginning working out. If you're just getting back into the groove then buy this video! You can work your way up to level two and then three when you're ready. The moves are quite basic and would be easy even if you're battling with losing a lot of weight right now. All you need are some weights! I use two pound weights, they are just enough to get my muscles working. I have a bunch of Jillian's videos, but this is always my go-to video when I want some cardio! If I really want to workout, but I don't want to kill myself I will do level one, if I am feeling like a really need a beating then I'll go to level two or three.

3086097,4,B00127RAJY,"Its been quite some time since I last did this workout...(I just repurchased because of how my first time using it went!) So let me give you a bit of background.  Please stay with me...the extra information is quite a bit, but I feel that it counts toward the review's final say! Hope it helps!

(Back in 2008) My first time using it, I was about 25 pounds over my allowable weight.  I had a lot of ""icky"" stuff going on in my life and I was overeating...plus I was national guard working at the MEPS, an active duty location.  Weight was VERY important.  So I had to get it together! I purchased the book first and then read some reviews about this dvd so I purchased it.  IT WAS OUTSTANDING.  I am always up for a challenge, this was more or less my home workout gateway.

It was short enough for me not to get bored...it was challenging to the point where I started competing against myself, but not overly so where one would become discouraged.  SO...I can say that there is a good balance when it comes to this dvd.  The recipes in the book and the written guidance helped me with my diet as well. I dropped that 25 pounds plus a few more and then I was motivated to start running.  I paired this dvd with my running and my body was nicely toned!(seriously...I looked better than I did in high school...and I had a 4 year old at the time!)  Eventually I graduated beyond this dvd and was able to take what I learned in the dvd and other things I picked up along the way regarding fitness to keep my body at my target weight.

(In 2010) I was injured overseas in a rocket attack that among quite a few injuries took a large chunk of muscle out of my right thigh.  During the healing process I was only able to do Jillian's Yoga Meltdown dvd which was another great buy...(I recommend that!) It was the start for me to get back on my feet I was back to running about 7-8 months after my injury.  After that I was able to go back to my fitness knowledge to maintain my body.  (are you seeing a pattern yet?!)

(In 2011-2012)  During my recent pregnancy I was unable to work out because of the physical pain I was in due to my previous trauma injuries.  Now I am recovering from a hernia repair....I will be cleared to exercise in 2 more weeks.

(In...NOW) SO...here I am today about 5 months postpartum and 2 weeks away from medical release (to exercise) and I purchased her dvd yet again. (I loaned it to a friend when I ""graduated"" to other fitness options and never got it back OR I would TOTALLY still have it.  I won't be loaning this baby out again!!!!-lesson learned)

I SAID ALL THAT TO SAY:  Jillian's workout methods WORK.  As long as you remain determined, push through, do it those 5-6 times a week(basically remain consistent), and make some changes to your diet...the weight can be lost! I like her because she promotes not accepting excuses.  The exercises target the key areas and ramp up your heart rate when you really put your ALL into it.  A person only gets out what they put in!

This is a great starter dvd for someone looking to get their body on point.  It's not intimidating or boring.  I have done P90X and during my deployment I did some of the Insanity workout(before I got hurt) and those workouts ARE GREAT AS WELL...BUT may be intimidating or scary to someone that is just starting, trying to ease back into working out, or have injuries that prohibit them from doing the exercises fully even WITH the modifications.  Even though Jillian Michaels has a lot of Plyo(jump training) in her workouts...there is a way to modify if necessary and still reap the benefits especially if coupled with other methods of fitness.

This dvd is one that should remain in your collection.  It has been a doorway for me when most needed while providing me with basic knowledge of what makes noticeable change in my body. Don't compare it to Insanity or P90X...those workouts are in their own separate category.  I mean beachbody alone (the company those fall under) are in a category of their own...so just give Jillian her credit where it is do!

SOOOOO  I believe you should just press the button.  You know which button Im talking about right?  The buy/purchase button.  PUT IT IN YOUR CART!!! I'm serious!!! Just do it...give it a go.  NOW GO GET FIT!!!! :-)",1355443200,4,4279,4.409438775510204

The video features both advanced and simplified versions of most of the exercises, and if you follow the timeline, you really can work your way up to the advanced workout. I wish it had better music, but they wouldn't be able to sell it at this price if they had to license anything worth listening to.

The best tip I can offer is DO NOT give up! Each workout is broken down into three parts. When you finish the first part, you will not know how you can do it two more time. That's okay. You'll figure it out, and by the time you get to the third round, you'll be able to power through. Start with the regular moves and step down to the simpler modifications if you need to.",1355356800,,724,4.134751773049645
3086101,5,B00127RAJY,"...and you will love her for it. This 20 minute workout is intense but not so much so that you're dead. You still feel like you've had an hour long workout. Jillian focuses on combination strength moves. She works you through a warm-up, 3 rounds of 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, and 1 minute of abs, and a cool down. I did this for a week and already saw results: more toned abs, more toned arbs, cardio improved.

Jillian is also very encouraging. You don't even realize it, but when you're trying to get those last reps in and want to give up, she reminds you to keep going. When the workout is only 20 minutes, every minute counts.

I definitely recommend the DVD for anyone who needs a quick workout and wants all over results.",1355270400,,739,4.386861313868613

Caveat:  I've only done Day One of Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred at Level I. I'm not in the best of shape but not in the worst either and this was deceptively difficult. Easy moves done enough to make it hard. The few muscles I have have now turned to Jello. Impressive. And only 20 minutes and she keeps you motivated to keep going. Usually I get bored and turn videos off but in this case because nothing was excruciating or contorted or just too slow or boring, I kept on through it.  And about half way in the burn started and my legs were a bit wobbly.

This is old school calisthetics and basic gym aerobics put together by a professional in a way that really makes your body work.  Push ups, jumping jacks, crunches, combined with minor weights.  Sounds deceptively simple and easy...but I think that's probably the beauty of it is that it is simple...and seems easy at first...but quickly becomes muscle fatiguing and gets your heart rate going.  And that's all you want in a good workout.

I work out 4- 5 days a week and Jillian's dvd's still make my heart pound and burn away my unwanted calories.  I highly recommend Jillian's work outs if you haven't tried them.

Has different videos for different levels of fitness (3)
Just have a mat and weights and you are ready to go
Great for toning
Cheap

Cons-
No number of ""reps"" to complete which can be confusing when they change camera angles and you try to keep up with the people doing the exercise.
Gets repetitive
After completing this the first time, I had to stop for a while because I was having knee issues

Overall, I'd say get it but mix it with other workout DVD's as this one can get old and has high knee impact moves.",1354924800,,520,4.19
3086116,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout. I suggest having two different sets of weights on hand. I have 5 lbs and 8 lbs. One thing I recommend is adding in extra cardio with this workout. This is great for toning and keeping the heartrate up, but you definitely need more cardio. You must have a good diet plan in place as well. Track your calories, watch your sugar intake and eat extra protein since you're building up your muscles.

Don't do what I did. I'm in relatively good shape and day 1 I did level 1. Day 2 I skipped level 1 and went to level 2. I suggest waiting until level 1 starts to seem a little easy before switch to level 2.

I loved the video the first several days and you really do feel it especially in your tummy but my goodness the pain in my shins was awful. I purchased this to help me lose baby weight and tone my stomach. I used two cans of white beans instead of weights. My 4 year old saw me doing it and went in the kitchen to grab her own campbell soup cans and did some of the exercise too. She thought it was fun. You will sweat for sure! I had my husband rip this onto his computer and stream it though the apple tv so I could do it on any of our tv's in the house while the baby slept.

3086120,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this video more than a year ago, and I still use it regularly. I have never stuck with a workout program this long. I like it because it features three different workouts of only 20 minutes each. I can get a challenging workout (sweat, sore muscles, heart pounding) in less than half the time of a typical workout video. Whenever I try to talk myself out of working out, I just say, ""You can do anything for 20 minutes!""

The workouts are VERY challenging, especially for beginners. The first time I did it, I could hardly walk the next day! But my body got stronger very quickly, and I was moving up to more challenging workouts in no time.

The whole ""30 day shred"" idea is not exactly true. For one thing, I don't work out every day. I think your muscles need a day's rest in between. And I wouldn't say this video has gotten me ""shredded."" I'm a 41-year-old woman with two kids. I couldn't be shredded if I could afford a full-time trainer! But I have gotten significantly stronger, and my endurance has improved tremendoulsy.

3086123,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this back in late June/early July of 2012.  I'm a person who hasn't really worked out in over a decade since I stopped playing football in college.  I was terribly out of shape.  My problem?  Between work and children, I simply do not have the time to devote to spending over an hour working out.  It was always my belief that a person needed to devote that kind of time in order to get in shape and see a difference in their bodies. Enter ""30 Day Shred.""

I read the reviews here on Amazon, and decide to take the plunge.  I figured that worst case scenario, I get in better shape, even if I don't necessarily look it.  Anything is better than nothing right?  And for the cost of this DVD?  There was NOTHING to lose and EVERYTHING to gain.  I started with the level one workout back in early July.  Watching it, it didn't seem to difficult, but let me tell you, for someone like me who was totally out of shape, it was!

Here's the thing- It's now December, and guess what? I'm STILL doing level one.  Why?  Because I push myself to my physical limit.  Every day.  Every workout.  There's has been no need at all for me to switch up the routine.  In spite of the fact that the workout is only around 25 minutes with the warmup and cooldown, I have seen a dramatic change in my body.  I've lost my gut, and lovehandles.  I have abs!  Ones I can actually see!

For me there has been a few keys to success:

1. Do the workout everyday if you can.  I've do it almost everyday.  On average, I've probably missed one or two days per month, simply because I listen to my body, and if I'm that physically exhausted, I give it rest, however, like I said, I only do it once or twice a month, if that;
2. DO NOT SLACK OFF when doing the workout.  Like Jillian says, it's a short workout so you need to push yourself.  For example, I do 3 jumping jacks for every two the models do; During each 30 second punching portion of cardio, I do anywhere from 50 to 60+ punches.  You can do it too, you just have to will yourself to do so, even on days where you're tired and you're not in the mood to move, let alone workout.  No one can make you push yourself but you, and when we're talking about a measily 25 minutes of your day, there's no excuse to not do it;
3.  You obviously need to eat better.  What I've done is cut out the white carbs from my diet as much as possible, and I try to avoid sugars and carbs when I can.  I still eat them, don't get me wrong- and your body needs them, just try and eat brown cabs with fiber when you can.  Yes, I eat pizza, ice cream, and candy, but I don't do it everyday, and pig out.

I'm so happy with the success I've had doing 1/3 of this inexpensive, 25 minute workout DVD.  I don't know how much weight I've lost, but I definitely have, as I've gone from 36 inch waist to about a 31 inch waist, where I can see my abs- something I didn't think would be possible in my lifetime, and something that was never an expectation I had going into this.  If I knew I could invest such little time and get such great results, I would have done this YEARS ago.  I believe in this workout so much I went ahead and bought another copy for my parents and I'm convincing them to do the modified exercises, and do what they can because anything is better then nothing.  If you get this DVD good luck with it.  Follow my advice and you will see results.",1354752000,6,3376,4.094656488549618

I started this video 3 days ago with the intention to get toned, and lose a few pounds. I am very out of shape. I rarely exercise, so doing this was a shock. Day one, I was exhausted, out of breath, and almost passed out. It was so intense and it was level one! I also used 5 pound weights, when I probably should have used less. The next day, I weighed myself, and saw I lost 2 pounds already! I was in such a happy mood, that I decided to jump right up to level 2! Ha well that was a mistake, and I thought level 1 was hard! It was insane! I couldn't do half the moves, but worked out as much as I could! Afterwards, I was soooo sore! I couldn't walk up or down stairs, couldn't move my arms a certain way, etc. I was in such pain, and still am! Now i'm only on day 3, I went back to level 1, and I really see a difference in my body already! My thighs are becoming less flabby. My arms are becoming more muscular. It definitely hurts, but its totally worth it! I am definately sticking to this, and ill hopefuly write back soon when i'm getting more results!

3086138,5,B00127RAJY,"All three of the workouts on this DVD are great, alone or combined for a longer workout.  The 3-2-1 format keeps the heart rate up and makes the workouts fly by quickly.  I have really noticed an improvement in my core strength since discovering this and other Jillian workouts a year ago.  I used to wake up every morning with a sore lower back and struggled through the pain to run and walk for exercise.  After diligently working out with Jillian 6 days per week for a year, I now have a strong core and lower back, and I am pain free.  I never thought I could actually do back strengthening exercises in addition to ab work, but now I can do Supermans with the rest of 'em!  My advice to other back pain sufferers is to stick with it -- modify exercises as needed in the beginning as you are building core strength.  There were several exercises I couldn't do or had to modify in the beginning because of my back pain (Supermans were out of the question), but I can do them now thanks to all those ab exercises and planks.  I highly recommend this DVD - it can change your life!",1354406400,,1082,4.269607843137255

I couldn't get through the crawl push ups; killer.  Now I am doing week 2 and guess what?  Amazing things are happening!  I wake up in the morning with a zing! Not a struggle to sit up and get out of bed.  Running up a flight of stairs at the school I work at is much easier. I actually have more energy than the kids! What's more, I can already see a difference in my bod.  My chest and back feel more toned and my abs have an itty bitty 2 pack.  Yes!  This is a killer work out but it's only 30 minutes; perfect for those crunched for time. I love it because I don't have to pack up and go to the gym or fight traffic and stress out driving somewhere. Jillian is right there in my living room with me, kicking my butt and whipping me into shape. Let me tell you: this work out will NOT work if you don't push ""PLAY"" and get up out of your chair and do the exercises.  You have to move and ""bring it""!

The three levels of workouts, and 3 2 1 sequence of strength, cardio and abs keep the workout interesting and makes the time fly, I'm done before I know it.

I don't do it in 30 days - I use the DVD 3 times a week and alternate it with yoga or running. There isn't much stretching for warm up or for a cool down, so even though its a 20 minute work out and a 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down, I generally take about 40 with the stretching.

Great if you are just getting back into exercising or looking to begin. The two girls you can watch are great inspiration to try harder and you can see your improvement.

Thus, I did a lot of research on good DVDs and some essential ""props"" and over the past few months have purchased about 12 DVDs from TaeBo to PIlates to the Biggest Loser series, and then I saw this new one from Jillian, and it surpassed everything else I own by far. I have been working out pretty regularly for over 10 years, I've done triathlon's and everything from spinning to running to kickboxing, so I figured I could start at Level 3. After 3 minutes I went down to Level 2, and then another five minutes to Level 1!!! I have been doing Level 1 for a week and think I will be able to progress a level each week, but it is truly a challenging and rewarding workout, and I highly recommend it for people who enjoy maximum results in minimal time (and don't mind sweating and feel like they might have a heart attack!)",1206489600,139,971,4.170212765957447

3312882,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a really good workout.  It's geared a little more to advanced exercisers, but the choreography is fairly basic and you will definately feel this the next day.
There are three workouts that combine toning and aerobics together which are about a half an hour each.  This way, you're burning fat and toning muscles at the same time.  It's a little challenging, but fun and effective.  The first workout is the easiest of the three and from there it gets more challenging.  The most challenging workout is tough like she shows on The Biggest Loser (ie travelling pushups and tough jumps etc).  It's a good idea if you're intermediate to begin either at the start or middle and stick to that for a while and then move on.  Each workout uses toning, kickboxing and ab work.
I found this really good to do.  It's absolutely a good idea to not go too quickly with it and begin at the lower of the three levels even if you do it only a couple of times - you can always advance as soon as you're ready for your next workout.  She may not be the best cuer, but she is certainly encouraging and motivating.  This is fun and I highly recommend it.

3312947,5,B00127RAJY,"Years ago, I enjoyed working out to Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos but my main form of exercise was going for brisk walks. I live in Wisconsin where at least four months out of the year, we are pretty much quarantined inside because of the cold so going for walks doesn't work out most of the time. I really had gotten out of shape and needed to lose weight when a friend of mine said she uses Jillian Michaels' DVDs to workout. I had never used one of hers before but figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. I searched quite a bit and decided to try the 30-Day Shred since it seemed like a popular choice.

Jillian Michaels is a fitness trainer and people may recognize her from her coaching on the show, The Biggest Loser. The 30-Day Shred consists of three different workouts which increase in intensity and use her 3-2-1 Interval System. Each workout is 20 minutes long with a two-minute warm-up before the workout and a two-minute cool down after the workout. There is a tiny break between each exercise so you can get in position and so Jillian can explain the exercise so the entire workout will take about 27 minutes total with the warm-up and cool down.

Each 20-minute workout consists of three of the 3-2-1 circuits (all exercises are different so you won't get bored). For anyone who doesn't know this system (since I didn't before I got this DVD), there are three minutes of strength exercises followed by two minutes of cardio exercises followed by one minute of abs exercises. Once you complete the first circuit, you will start with the second circuit. The exercises get a bit harder as you progress in the workout but you get warmed up and used to them.

There are three levels of workouts: levels one, two and three. Level one is the easiest but isn't considered ""easy"" by any means. I've been using this DVD for at least a few days every week and I'm on level two, which is still difficult but I'm getting better at it.

To get the most benefit from the workout, you will want to purchase some hand weights. I am using three-pound weights which is what I started with and it's tough! If you are new to working out, I would start with a lower weight. If you are working out on a hard surface, you will also want to buy a yoga/exercise mat.

Let me tell you, this DVD has been AMAZING so far! The first time I did it just under three months ago, I looked at the TV and thought ""Are you kidding me????"" because it was tough. I won't lie about that. A week later, I decided to try it again and it was a bit easier since I was somewhat familiar with the exercises. I discovered how much I enjoy the exercises and the feeling I get after an intense workout! There is such a variety of exercises that you won't likely get bored unless you feel it's time to move up to the next level, which is how I knew I was ready to try level two. I even get excited when I know I'm going to use this DVD!

Jillian is very motivating and she will push you, which is a good thing. She jokes around with the girls who workout behind her. One girl will do the modified versions for beginners and one will do the advanced versions. Jillian does a great job pointing out the differences and explaining how to do the exercises so you are doing them correctly and getting the most out of the workout.

I bought this DVD about two-and-a-half months ago and I've already lost 21 pounds! I use this DVD typically three or four times a week, along with eating healthy, and even walking outside when it's nice out. I'm very proud of what I've accomplished and I have Jillian Michaels to thank for designing an awesome workout system! I've told many of my friends that I use these DVDs and some of them have purchased them as well. Whether you are a beginner or experienced, I think you will enjoy this DVD and I highly recommend it!",1522713600,8,3818,4.3314685314685315

I bought the weights and set my mind to it. But I couldn't keep up past 15 days or so. I just let go again. Was not enough for me to keep going. Depends on how you like to work out. I ended up joining kickboxing and that is what is working for me. The dvd workout itself is good. Has 3 stages that you work your way up to.

3312992,5,B00127RAJY,"BUCKLE UP FOR A DETAILED REVIEW: Im a 27 female. My starting weight was at 213 and I was doing absolutely no physical activity before I started this tape. I was fit during college (age 18-22) but I gained a lot of weight since then due to working a desk job and being lazy.

On 1/1/2018, I started eating healthier breakfasts and lunches. I had a yogurt for breakfast and low-carb lunch (sweet potatoes, lentils, veggies, apple/almond butter, half of a whole grain chicken sandwich type of things). For dinner, I mostly ate healthy and if we went out I would just pick the lowest calorie salad on the menu.

I went to the doctor and they weighed me at 213. Then, I started the 30 Day Shred. Im almost at the end of the 30 Days and I weigh 186 according to my home scale which we just bought and is accurate (also verified by my husband). I did not change my eating habits, I just tried to eat healthier.

I did Level 1 for 10 days and then went straight to Level 3. I only did Level 2 for 1 day as it started off with way too much jumping for me (I hate jumping up and down). When I started Level 1, it was HARD. By the end of the 10 days, it started feeling easier so I felt like I could jump to Level 3. Level 3 had butt kicks, walking push-ups, Supermans, boxing with weights, sit-ups, jump squats, etc.

Theres two girls on the tape, one harder and one with modifications and I did follow the modification one sometimes - I didn't always do the hard girl even in Level 1. In Level 3, I switched the rockstar jumps with high knees and kicks just because again, I had jumping up and down. worked out in the mornings because if I try to do it after work I will not do it.

RESULTS: My watch feels looser, I have more energy, my pants feel looser, my stomach isn't as protruding when I lay down in bed. Im still not down to my goal weight of 150. I do think that I lost a lot of weight because I was not doing anything before AND because I have more to lose (if you're already smaller this will help you with toning), but I do credit this video for getting me off my butt and melting some easy weight off of me. I will continue using this DVD and will update my review if something changes.

Hope this helps! You can do it! Make it through 10 days and then youll be unstoppable!",1518739200,71,2278,4.096412556053812

Day 1: Wow. Level 1 is such a difficult workout for someone who is out of shape. I was so gassed by the end. My heart was pounding during each 2 minutes of cardio. I definitely couldn't do a decent push-up, even on my knees. My arms were dying by the end, My legs were wobbly on the lunges. I thought to myself, ""How will I ever be in shape for Level 2?!"" I decided instead of focusing on the things I can't do, just stick with it each day and see how much I improve in 30 days.

Day 7. Jillian is right! By day 4 or 5 I could tell a huuuuge difference. My body is adapting! Cardio feels like a walk in the park compared to day 1. I can do about 6 legitimate push-ups, although still on my knees. I can't wait to see how many push-ups I can do by the end. I continue to do more and more each time, increasing my hand weights and going deeper into the moves. I can't believe I am saying this, but I think I'll be ready for Level 2 by day 10.

Day 11: My first day of Level 2 is exactly how I felt on Day 1... like I wanted to die. For most of the moves, I was back to following Anita. Somewhat discouraging because I went in feeling so confident and that I was ready for Level 2 and it quickly reminded me that I have way more work to do. I definitely could not keep my butt down throughout all of the plank exercises, but I look forward to seeing what I will be able to do 10 days from now.  I keep telling myself to ""trust the process"" and just do my best. I can already see my body starting to change in the mirror. Working out everyday and trying to eat healthier is heading in the right direction.",1515196800,28,1698,3.898843930635838
3313061,5,B00127RAJY,"30DS delivers incredible results. I started out at 168lbs. with a goal weight loss of 28lbs. I had just had my second baby by cesarean and never really worked out prior to trying this. This DVD got me to 140lbs. in about 3 months.

The modifier was a lifesaver. I was awful on day 1. My fitness level was very poor and the workout was difficult. I had to take breaks during the cardio and was dripping sweat. I stayed on Level 1 for way longer than 10 days because it was so hard that I just wasn't ready for Level 2. I think after about 6 weeks I began to progress to the next levels.

If you stick to a diet and do this at least 5 days per week, results will come in literally just days. After week one my legs were firmer and my core was stronger. Bending over to pick things up was easier. It was like I had an extra spring in my step. Just after week one! I was back in my jeans so fast and they fit me better than before with my legs and butt filling them out in all the right places.

3313093,3,B00127RAJY,"I've been spoiled by Jillian's other DVDs.  I came to this one when I was running out of Jillian Michaels workouts to buy (I have almost all of them).  I was really disappointed with the production quality.  The music is too loud, it's hard to hear her, and their clothes and environment are very plain.  Beyond the production value, the segments are surprisingly unbalancedpart of the workout will feel really easy, and another part too hard, rather than alternating the two in a perfect harmony of challenge and recovery time, which is so common in her other DVDs.  I tried the workouts once and went back to Ripped in 30 as my main full body shredder.  I do 2-4 Jillian Michaels workouts a day when I have time; there's no time to waste.

Skip this more famous DVD and get Jillian's newer ""Ripped in 30"" instead.  Same idea, much better production and workout balance.

And, in case you didn't know this: Jillian Michaels is the queen of workout DVDs.  My progress is so fast on these that the people around me take notice within a week of me starting a new Jillian regimen, and I feel incredible!  Over the last 10 years, I've used these to tone up, lose weight, gain energy, recover from injury, etc.  If you tried 30 Day Shred, though, and didn't like it, just know these early DVDs are her roughest.

Skip 30 Day Shred, No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and 6 Week Six-Pack, and go for anything and everything else.  My favorites are Ripped in 30 and the Killer series (Killer Arms & Back is my nirvana).  Also, if you've slipped out of exercise for a while or need the basics, Beginner Shred is excellent.  It will transition you right into Ripped in 30.  I strongly recommend starting with one of these.",1511654400,4,1730,4.529032258064516

DVD is easy to use exercises are not hard and she gives you time to get to the next exercise before moving on. She gives you safety tip so your not hurt yourself.  Good price

Cons
Start the DVD and then get your shoes on and wieghts ready and a drink quite a few adds before the menu actually shows up and there's no skipping. The first time I can see but when your watching it every day you'll have it memorized in a week lol

I am a 25-year-old woman at a healthy weight who had previously been running four times a week, so I was not out of shape. As recommended/required by Jillian, I did the program every day. I ended up developing tendonitis in my knee by Day 22, which my doctor stated was due to the high demands of the knees in this program combined with absolutely no rest days. I had previously had no problems with my knees, even when running. It has taken me months of expensive physical therapy to reduce the pain and regain use of my knee.

I cant exercise for most likely weeks now maybe months. I am really injured and it hurts all day. Plus you don't lose weight. You will get toned. But not weight loss. Not one pound lost and I did 2 levels some days.  If you do the video don't do everyday. Switch up. I am in good shape and have about 15 pounds I want to lose. I started video almost 6 days a week. After 2 weeks Im injured from the pounding on my ankles. And 0 pounds lost. Toned yes.  I used to run and be an athlete. Ive never had anything like this and I am in my thirties. Im not overweight and Im not old and I am athletic. So I did everything proper form, I stretched more than shown and I did to my ability.  I should have just started jogging instead of this. And she is a bit annoying. Not encouraging at times when could be more encouraging. People that lost weight- read their posts- they usually jogged too and were eating differently. And surprisingly my knees ok though I kept thinking this kinda rough on knees. Think about it- Jillian would never do this for 30 Days straight. She would switch it up.

3313211,4,B00127RAJY,"So I've done many of the Jillian Michael's workouts, but this was my first, and I think it's the best. It will kick your butt. It's my go to when I need to tone up a bit (I don't really need/want to lose 30 pounds, let alone in 30 days.)  I've done it multiple times over the years and pretty much every time my body aches after day one, but this last time, it wasn't so bad. Perhaps I'm finally getting better! And it's not just for chicks. I badgered my husband into doing it with me and I'm pretty sure we he agreed he was like, ""Ah, sure, I'll humor her by doing her ladies workout,"" and boy was he shocked! He also had muscle soreness for a few days afterwards and now he also uses this from time to time as a quick butt kicking workout.

Things I like about the workouts include:
1.) The length! They come in at just under 30 minutes including warm ups and cool downs so they aren't a massive time suck.  The downside of this is that you don't burn a ton of calories during such a short workout (I come in a just under 200 according to my fitbit-I'm 5'7 145lbs and usually my max heart rate for the work out is 160).
2.) It's very focused on strength training and overloading your muscle groups. I mean, I friggin' hate push ups and all the variety of plank exercises that she keeps making me do and depending on the workout either my shoulders/back/arms or my thighs (but usually my shoulders) are killing me when we finish. In workout two it's like a complete blitz on the shoulders with planks being in the cardio and the abs and some tough shoulder stuff in the strength training. I think this helps build muscle and tone quicker.
3.) The workout never gets easier. I mean, ideally it does. But you can keep it tough by moving up to follow Natalie (the more advanced movements) or by adding heavier weights to the exercises as you get stronger.

Things I don't like:
1.) The overloading work on the muscle groups, while effective, I think can also cause more injuries as you become more exhausted and your form suffers. I try to keep pace with Jillian and co. but sometimes will realize that I'm not keeping my back flat or I'm extending my knee over my toes and I have to back off (especially during the pendulum and jumping lunges. I have terrible balance and can't keep their pace with good form at all.)
2.) You are supposed to do ten days in a row for each set without breaks until you hit thirty days (I believe). I don't think that's very safe. Your muscles need time to recover. These exercises are intense. I usually take a break after day 5 or so (sometimes more often or sometimes I'll do the full ten without a break.)
3.) It gets monotonous doing the same thing ten days in a row. On the one hand, I do like to see how I progress. On the other, I can get bored.
4.) These exercises are very squat and lunge intensive. In other words, very hard on your knees. In workout three she adds a bunch of plyometrics which compounds the knee work/pressure. I've been doing this dvd off and on for about ten years (and I will go a year or two without doing it at all, don't get me wrong) but I definitely notice it in my knees more now (I'm in my late 30s). If you have knee trouble, this might not be the dvd for you. I think you would have to modify like 80% of the exercises.

As for results, you definitely need to follow a sensible diet plan for any significant weight loss. You can't do this and eat like crap and lose 30 pounds in 30 days.  Usually I will pair it with a diet of some sort, but this time I'm not changing my eating at all. I definitely notice increased strength and definition in my arms and my tummy. I haven't really lost weight this time, but I'm not really trying to. When I watch what I eat and do this and try and get 10,000 steps a day, I definitely lose weight. I would just say, don't get discouraged if you can't do the whole thing right away. It's legitimately hard. I still can't do a real push up! But I keep trying. Some day I'll get there. :)",1509408000,2,3993,4.192708333333333

I just read the description of the DVD and decided to give it a go. I do find Jillian's constant chatter annoying, but I just use Bluetooth headphones and listen to music to drown her out. The reason I docked a star is because the DVD has a loooooong intro that you can't skip! I used to start the DVD and then go change into my workout clothes, set up my mat and grab my weights and it *might* have been ready to start. I accidentally found a way around that though. If you have a DVD player that remembers where you left off when you hit play, you can start the workout and hit stop. Then when you play it the next time, it starts right at the beginning of the workout. This has saved me so much time. I can get right to the workout and continue on with my day.",1508198400,2,896,3.9833333333333334

Pros: It gets your heart rate up.
It's challenging.
Cons: LONG intro you can't skip after the first time. When I'm ready to work out, I'm ready.
Not enough ab work for my tastes.
Too much jumping around all shoved together.
Not long enough of a workout - I feel like I need more when I'm done.
Always, ALWAYS gives me calf cramps (and no, I'm not dehydrated) making me pause for a minute while waiting for them to abate - which throws me off my game.
Decision: I'll keep it in my rotation, but there's no way I'm doing it more than once a week - if that often.",1507075200,,816,4.203821656050955

3313339,5,B00127RAJY,"I thoroughly enjoyed this workout. It's true you can watch it for free on youtube, but it's constantly getting flagged and removed. The 8 bucks were worth it to spend for the consistency alone.

You're going to notice a change in inches by doing this workout by itself, but if you want to see the numbers drop down on the scale you need to drink more water, eat healthier and possibly add an additional ten minutes of cardio. Nothing major, just a short run or a few minutes jumping rope as a warm up will do. I also recommend 5-6 days working out with this DVD and 1-2 days of yoga or something more low key. I personally really like Jillian's style but if you don't, you can always mute her and put on your own music once you get the routine down.

As a stay at home mom/student, I don't have a lot of time to fit exercise into my schedule. Warm up and cool down included, the entire thing is about 25 minutes. It's quick and dynamic enough that I don't get bored doing it. And most importantly, I feel like I'm getting a lot of bang for my buck; the results are definitely worth the 25 minutes of work. The best part? My three-year-old likes to do it with me. He says it's so much fun, and while he's still developing his fine and gross motor skills, he sticks with me through the whole thing so it's turned into a bonding thing/fun way for both of us to get moving. So for anyone with little guys at home, don't let that deter you. However, don't let that fool you into thinking this workout is easy; it's definitely a butt kicker!",1504742400,2,1535,4.235494880546075

3313399,1,B00127RAJY,I usually love Jillian Michaels but I just cannot believe this. I started this video and was very skeptical at first because every single movement she makes aside from ab work is bad for your knees. And that was just level 1. Then I moved up to level 2 and I could not believe my eyes. Every single movement was jumping bending high-impact movement on your knees. She is literally expecting people that are overweight to put all of their weight on their knees and not get injured. I am blown away I am so disappointed and I'm writing this review as a warning. I don't even have bad knees normally period but after 2 weeks of this video I'm worried I've done some serious damage. Not only that but I don't see any results at all.

When I started the video I was between 155-157 lbs.  I actually gained weight and was up to 160 lbs. (building muscle blah blah blah - I still felt crappy that I'd worked so hard and gained weight), and ended at 152 lb.  While I only lost about 3-5 lbs. I know for a fact that I lost inches all over.  I should have measured before I started, but I honestly didn't know what to expect.  This last weekend - after 35 days doing the shred - I was able fit into clothes that had been sitting in storage for three years! I took a star away from my review because by the third circuit JM is REALLY annoying to listen to.  She talks constantly!  We tried to switch it to the audio option where you can just listen to the music and not hear her talking, but there is absolutely no signal to tell you when to switch to the next exercise or circuit....which means you are stuck with JM annoying the crap out of you for twenty minutes.",1502755200,9,1071,4.100478468899522

Today is my first experience with this DVD and I have to say, I can't see why anyone wouldn't lose a fair amount of weight by following this with a sensible diet. So far I'm pretty impressed, I like the way Jillian Michaels encourages you along and her directions are easy to follow and not annoying. I want to lose about 10 pounds and generally be fitter and feel better in myself, I feel like this workout will get me there. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars at the moment is that, like with what other reviewers are saying, there are a lot of lunges and jumping jacks etc and I felt a bit of a pain in one of my knees near the beginning... I did adjust the way I was doing these moves a little bit and it seemed to stop the pain.... so I most likely wasn't doing them correctly somehow... maybe... will see how things go.",1501718400,2,962,4.015625

I turn bright red and sweat very profusely when I exercise and the embarrassment from that holds me back from going all-out in front of strangers.

Doing this workout in my living room allows me to not care at all what I look like while exercising. I can turn tomato red, sweat buckets and only my family members know. I don't have to hound my kids to get ready and take them to the gym childcare just to exercise.

I just did level 3 for the first time last night and it was literally the most challenging thing I have ever physically done. I actually visibly see a small change in my body today from a single workout!",1501545600,,913,4.364705882352941

I have a better body at 44 than I have ever had in my life.  Jillian Michaels is not only an outstanding fitness instructor, she is an inspirational woman.  I like her ""no BS/no excuses"" attitude in workouts and in life.  And her constant reminders that the hardest part of the workouts are the moments when your body transforms the most.  I actually find this lesson to apply in so many areas of life - especially as a parent.  Being a rock for your kids in the most difficult moments is what help your kids to learn, grow and transform the most.

3313534,5,B00127RAJY,"I love this workout! I ordered it on Amazon video so I can stream it wherever I go and I really like Jillian Michael's training style. She encourages you and more importantly explains WHY you are doing the moves you are doing. She's tough but she motivates you to give it your best.

I do this video 3 days a week (M/W/F) because I do Pilates the other two days (T/Th). Another thing I do is rotate which level I do for the day, there are three. So one week I'll do 1, 2, 3 then I'll rotate and do 2, 3, 1, then 3, 1, 2 then repeat. I think it's a good idea to always keep your muscle memory guessing for the best results.

This video is challenging and I do flip Jillian off occasionally but that means it's working and I'm always sweating after my workout!

Another thing to note is there are two other women for you to watch that do the moves with you; one for the advanced movement and one for modified movements if you're just starting out.",1499817600,3,945,4.125

The answer is just because I can doesn't mean I should. Holy joint pain! I'm 34 years old, 120 pounds, 5'8"", in good shape. Doing this DVD for a month destroyed my knees first, then my hips. I'm very careful to follow directions, listen to my body, wear the best shoes, etc. (I regularly go for one-mile runs and never run into joint problems.) Not only was all this hard-impact jumping bad for my body, it was not fun. At the end of the workouts I really didn't feel the good soreness in my muscles, not like I did with the Beginner Shred! It was like we wasted so much time with stupid jumping cardio that half the good strength training was cut out. It is really frustrating to have to take days off from working out because you don't want to hurt yourself. I'm going to go back to the low-impact Beginner Shred and add some more modifications to make it harder -- that's one good thing I'm getting from this DVD, a few more strength modifications I can take back to the Beginner Shred.

Can't wait to do round 2 when I finish the 30 days to see if I can do all the workout without doing the modify version.

Level two is (I think) the most difficult. When I would do all three back to back, I would have to do it first or I would be too burned out to finish it.
Level three feels like an achievement, which makes it so much fun.

3313843,5,B00127RAJY,"Bought this as a DVD but quickly realized that its sold on Amazon Prime TV- which worked perfectly because I had been putting off doing it as my DVD player is no longer hooked up to my TV and it was going to be a project to hook up again, so with Prime I had no excuses.

Some background, I'm 45yo, 5'5"" and normally between 125 and 135, 145 is my max number- you know, the number that wakes you up and says, ""WHOA! Stop the chips!"". I do not work out and in all honesty I am/was skinny fat. In June of last year I started cross fit, stuck with it for 8 weeks until September, went away on vaca and had an unrelated injury when I returned & never went back to cross-fit. That is the extent of my lifetime work out history. My daughter went to college on the other side of the country in August and since then I have steadily gained (freshman 40 for mom), but worse- I simply didn't care. I went up to 175, my heaviest EVER and felt like ""eh, I'm 45, all moms are fat at 45"". (Not true btw) and it didn't hurt that it was winter. Now- 175 and nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, fits and summer is fast approaching.

My girlfriend turned me on to Jillian Michael's when she showed me her before and after pics after doing Body Revolution. She and I have always run neck in neck with our weight (although not recently) and we have the same build, so after seeing her Incredible results in only a few weeks, I had hope. Knew I could never do Body Revolution with no prior working out, and wasn't interested in spending that much money if I failed to commit, which I'm famous for. So I am trying this video, the price literally can't be beat, esp if you buy on Amazon prime TV.

4/21/17 Today is day 4- I know- you probably expected me to say I am done with it but no. I'll update as I go along. But so far I have gone from 175 to 170 (I started eating better 2 days before starting video). First 3 days I literally couldn't walk, sit, get up, climb stairs, etc. This morning something happened, I woke up and immediately noticed I felt better, soreness had alleviated tremendously and I was able to get out of bed and walk like a normal person - well 80% anyway. Had a cup of coffee and did my workout and before I knew it, it was over. Incredible. Prior to today it has been torture, counting down the minutes and today we were cooling down in what felt like 10 minutes. So I want to tell everyone- don't let the soreness scare you away. It will pass and level one will get easier, if not easier, at least faster... I don't have much to say beyond that as I am only in day 4, but I hope to update this post with some great before and after pictures in the next month or two.

Food wise I am having a coffee first thing am (milk and sugar, I WILL NOT skimp on my coffee), protein shake immediately after working out, Medifast meals/bars 2-3x throughout the day 110 calories high in protein (that's another story altogether), grilled/baked chicken with steamed or sauteed green vegetables, 1/2 apple and peanut butter or a handful of almonds as a desert/snack. Obviously nothing else but water throughout the day, but I do cheat with my 1 glass of wine in the evening, although have switched from white to red as per my old cross-fit instructors direction.

I'm writing the review because I know for me, an extremely non-athletic person, I very much need to read reviews and look at before and after's daily to keep motivated, although looking at my before pics seem to be motivation enough, however they are pretty depressing, so better to look at others who've succeeded. I intend to post mine someday soon.
Good luck to everyone!",1492732800,22,3624,4.269286754002911
3313844,4,B00127RAJY,"I wanted a jump start to bathing suit season and this looked like a practical way to get started. It was a lot more difficult than one would assume when they watch it. It is a good balance of cardio and strength training and the only equipment needed are hand weights and a floor mat (if you have hard floors). It got my heart pumping and I definitely woke up sore the next day. I like the fact that it is broken down into 20 min segments so you build up to doing an hour over the course of a month. That way if I don't have an entire hour, I can still do 20 or 40 mins and feel like I got a good workout.",1492646400,2,605,3.8095238095238093

I changed my lifestyle a little as well. Im a life long vegetarian, but decided to eat a vegan diet (no dairy), cut out most processed food and eat whole foods as well as get rid of refined sugar. We all know we cant out run a bad diet.
I did the program for 30 days and never advanced to level 3. I found it too hard, so i did level 2 twenty times instead.
In the morning and evening i would walk a couple of miles with my son.
In just 4 weeks i lost 13 lbs! I know i didn't JUST do the dvd everyday, but in combination with everything, i feel it really helped me tone and build muscle. I have continued on to other JM dvds and have fallen in love with her workouts!

I am 29, 5'4"" 120 ish, I was looking to get back to my 110lb weight and be toned again.
The first workout was KILLING my calves, my massage therapist said they felt inflamed. They were definitely not normal workout sore. So till they healed i couldn't do some moves, specifically jump rope. Halfway through level 2 my knees started hurting, which of course is more concerning. My shoulders joints hurt too but my knees were really bothering me. I decided to move on to another program mid workout on day 18 because I felt I was harming my body. I was even combining this with a gentle streatching/yoga routine every day.
That's great it works for some people! I just feel doing the exact same exercises every day puts too much stress on those body parts.

Level 1 is hard to start with (straight into pushups), so I advise jumping around in the levels to keep from getting bored and to cross train. In the first few weeks I had to rest when I couldn't keep going but gradually stopped taking rests. Also, after years of doing this, I listen to books on tape while working out instead of listening to Jillian. I know what to do.

I didn't end up doing 30 consecutive days due to illness and life but I did 30 workouts in 36 days. I didn't monitor my weight since that wasn't my main focus but I did notice a flatter stomach and more defined arms/shoulders. The best thing for me was that it strengthened my core significantly. I have had chronic back pain since I had my son and this REALLY helped decrease my back pain by strengthening my core. I finished the program a month ago but I am still doing the workouts 3-4 times a week to maintain my new strength and muscles. I cycle through the different levels. My advice to anyone attempting this program is KEEP GOING! It will suck sometimes, especially in the beginning but don't give up just do the easier modifications of the moves and try not to take more than 5 second breaks. You can do it!",1490140800,7,1134,4.2304147465437785

3313983,5,B00127RAJY,"This was my first Jillian workout DVD from many years ago and it is still one of my favorites.  In this video, she is straight forward, in some of her other workouts that followed, her personality comments are more over-the-top; I prefer the methods she used in this video.  Her 3, 2, 1 system with the integration of toning, cardio, and abs creates a nice blend.  I agree with the others that you cannot skip the opening information, which is annoying.  Also, once you become familiar with the workouts, you can make quicker transitions to each set.  She takes a few seconds introducing the next move.  I like to keep going and not break the momentum, so I can get a few more reps in while she is talking.",1490140800,,706,4.434108527131783

One partner is at the beginner's level and the other is at the experienced level. I guess she is the ""medium"" level. It is a great workout and I feel like my whole body was exercised.
Although I am at the starting gate, two of my co-workers recommended it to me. You can see results. They both lost weight and inches. One has developed some abdominal definition & the other has biceps that are becoming defined and ""hard"". Jillian is motivating and energetic.

3314025,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD because I liked the idea of being able to get in a good workout in 20 minutes.  I am a mom with two young children, work from home, and generally have a lot to get done in a day.  I knew that getting to the gym regularly (especially during the winter when my kids get sick and can't go to the daycare) wasn't going to happen.  I didn't have enough time in my day for that.  After putting off getting back on the work out wagon for a long time, this seemed like a good fit. I committed to doing it for 30 days, taking breaks only once a week.

My activity level prior to this was minimal.  I played with my kids and carried them around, but that was about it.  As far as weight goes, I am barely considered overweight from a medical standpoint, and most wouldn't say I was overweight by looking at me.  I decided going into this that weight loss was not my goal. I didn't weigh or measure myself.  I wanted to feel better and stronger -- so that was my focus.  I did take one picture of myself on the first day just to see if I noticed any difference.  What I did notice from the before and after picture was minimal -- but what I felt was huge.  Today I completed my 30th workout.  I did 10 days on Level 1, 10 days on Level 2 and 10 days on Level 3.  The first few days of level 1 were hard.  I could barely make it through the workout and was sore all day long.  Now, as long as my blood sugars didn't drop (I am a Type 1 diabetic), I can make it through Level 3 doing most of the more advanced level moves.  My body is stronger and more toned than it was prior to beginning -- which is honestly more than I expected.

I did my work outs in the morning.  I saw a huge increase in my energy levels.  I felt better.  While I would have sore muscles, Jillian does a good job of explaining the moves so that I didn't injure myself.  I modified exercises and worked towards doing the more intense versions.  Some days were harder than other, but I generally found if I forced myself to do it (even when sore and tired), I felt better by the end of it (once I caught my breath). All in all -- this is a good work out for what it is.  It's quick, you will sweat (lots), get your heart rate going and build muscle.  I have bought a few more of Jillian's workout videos and plan to make sure I keep getting at least 20 intense minutes of workout a day.  It may not be amazing -- but for someone like me who wasn't doing much before, it's a big improvement.",1489104000,7,2467,3.983673469387755

You really have to work for it, I was out of breath after the warmup on my first day.

3314071,5,B00127RAJY,"I have several workout dvd's. I like to alternate to keep it interesting. I've done the first (easiest) workout on this dvd about 3 or 4 times.  I like the fact that you are working harder than some other workouts but that it's less than half an hour.  Gillian comments on that at least once. If you wanted to extend the time frame, assume you could combine a couple of the workouts.
My goal is not necessarily to lose weight.  That being said, if that is your goal, I'm sure doing this work out daily and following a sensible diet would get you there.",1487030400,,552,4.288461538461538
3314072,3,B00127RAJY,"I workout 4-5 days a week and would consider myself an intermediate with regard to difficulty level.  I typically strength train 3 days a week and power walk the remaining days.

As for directions on doing this workout, I am not sure if during the unskippable 10 minute intro to the DVD there is any explanation of how often you are supposed to do these exercises but I tried to do them 4-5 times a week with walks.  I ended up having to actually go online to research it and came across the meal plan.  None of this information was provided within the DVD box or during any of the auditory instruction.

I really wanted to like this workout routine but I unfortunately didn't.  It does produce results but I found it so repetitive doing the exact same workouts two weeks at each level and there are only three workouts on this DVD.  I like to have some variety in my workouts and this just did not cut it for me on that level.  I would find myself wandering back to my Jessica Smith workouts one week into each segment.  Also, as an aside, if you live in an apartment, condo, or multi-family home this workout will probably not work for you as you will be doing a lot of jumping around and trust me, it will be noisy.

Now I don't want anyone getting the wrong idea, I do like other Jillian workouts and often do many of her free ones on YouTube, but this set of workouts to me was just lackluster and produced minimal results for my body.  I know I am already in somewhat good shape, but I really did not feel challenged and often times felt bored during the sessions.",1486944000,3,1570,4.288135593220339

We like to stay in shape and get our exercise in. These are 20 minute workouts. It definitely gets harder with each level. The only thing I added was some small weights and a mat for my hard floors. The downside is the music. You may want to play your own. :) It's a beginners workout but it does the job for us. We swap the levels around. It hits all the regions. It really focuses on abdominal workouts but I feel it every where. Some may get tired of doing the same thing for 10 days but for beginners it works great.,1482192000,3,667,4.022556390977444

Let say I went to sleep well workout and woke up with a soar back hurting abs. I do hip abs  DVD and it good but this a different type of work out.

Also, Jillian is serious. She doesn't chit chat like other trainers. Just show me the workout and let me do it. That's exactly what she does.  I like Jillian becaue she's intense. No fluff. You do what she says and you'll get results. She doesn't have obnoxious music or make you look like a crazy octopus in her workouts. She has easy to follow moves and they burn! Get her DVDs.

3314482,5,B00127RAJY,"I have a love/hate relationship with this DVD.  It is so hard, but it's hard to deny the results.

I am halfway through the 30 Day Shred. I haven't done it everyday (I average about 5 times a week), but since starting it on October 6, I have lost 1.5 inches off my waist and 1.5 inches off my hips.  Note that this is only halfway through, so I would say that 15 sessions into it has yielded nice, quick results.  My pants are feeling looser and I feel SO much stronger.  I haven't done it everyday because it's hard on my knees, but it's strange because on the days I don't do it, I feel lethargic and tired - and on the days I do it, I have an amazing amount of energy.

I won't sugarcoat it - Jillian is a monster and I cuss at her throughout the entire workout, but again - if it's results you're looking for, you're not going to do any better than this, considering it's only 20 minutes.  I will assure you that you will be dripping with sweat by the time you're done with those 20 minutes...and you'll be so happy that you got through it.  Starting out, you will be very, very sore, but like others have said, the soreness goes away after about 3 or 4 days.  I suggest powering through it the best that you can - I find that movement diminishes some of the soreness.

The only issue I have with this video is how hard it is on my knees.  This seems to have slightly diminished as I get stronger, but if you're carrying around a lot of extra weight (like me), your knees will be sore - period.  I have started each level at beginner movements, GRADUALLY moving toward the more advanced movements, but there are just some things I can't do (plank jacks, for one).  You will still get in a really good workout if you follow the beginner movements - don't be ashamed of that at all!

All in all, I know Jillian means well...but this workout is TOUGH.  Be prepared to sweat, and be prepared to be sore (at least initially).  But, also prepare to see results - quickly!",1477612800,6,1969,4.196808510638298

It is broken down into strength, cardio and abs.  I like that it works all these areas. I am only on Level 1 and I will try to get to a point where Level 1 is easy for me.

 I do really like the 20 minutes exercises once you can get to them, they are great but when time is short I just cant do this video.. and  switch to my cardio kick-box with Billy Blanks to get in my exercise routine...he gives  quick warm up and you get right to it..

Losing those 20 pounds gave me confidence and motivation and I lost the other 15 by exercising regularly and eating sensibly. Since then, I have held onto this dvd and it is my go-to workout when my scale starts creeping into numbers I don't like. In fact, I just started the program back up a couple of weeks ago and have already lost 8 pounds and feel better overall. I definitely start noticing a difference around the 3rd or 4th day and it motivates me to keep going. I love that the workouts are less than 30 minutes and the exercises aren't super difficult. I tried P90x and could not do some of the exercises, didn't have or want to buy some of the equipment required and the workouts were way too time consuming for me. While I don't end up looking anywhere near as fit as Jillian or her girls in the video after 30 days (you would need to eat, breathe, sleep fitness for that), I definitely feel more toned, my clothes fit better and my scale is a much happier number.

Jillian's 30 day shred covers all the bases: strength, cardio, and abs, and starts with level 1 and moves up to level 3. I usually do level 2 and 3 together, which totals about 40 minutes. I do this twice a week and run 3x per week and it keeps me tone and I'm in the best shape I've ever been in.

The workouts are intense intervals, which I like. It usually makes my legs sore from all the lunges and squats, but it's worth it!

I've been using this dvd for years. It helped me lose 30 lbs about 5 years ago. I used to do low impact cardio (Denise Austin), but I eventually realized that I was wasting my time. The workouts were not intense enough to get results.

3314657,5,B00127RAJY,"I purchased this DVD in March of 1989 after having gone many years without doing any type of weight training workout. I loved it from the start. It was so hard, I couldn't even do all the exercises in the 28 minute workout. I kept at it, though, and soon had Level 1 mastered. Two years ago I joined a gym and do an hour long workout 3 times per week, but still, 7.5 years later, come back to this same workout any time I can't make it to the gym. Sometimes I do it just to have a different workout, and it always makes me sore the next day. I probably still do it about 2-3 times per month.  I love it because it is short, covers all the major muscle groups, and gets down to business.  I have bought several other DVDs through the years, but always come back to this one. I recommend it to people all the time. I just looked up my Amazon history this morning to see how many years I have been doing it and decided to write a review. It has whipped me into shape and made me really stick with exercise for over 7 years! The only thing I don't love about it is the music, Since I know the routines so well now, though, I often turn the sound down and play my own. It is an awesome video for those who want nice muscle definition in as little time as possible. Oh, I also love that it is a cardio workout as well.  It definitely keeps your heart rate up. By the way, I am 52 years old now. However, my 3 teenage and 20 something daughters can't keep up with me on it. They have tried : )  I definitely recommend.",1472256000,8,1511,3.9768976897689767

3314886,5,B00127RAJY,"This workout will kick your butt. Even though I haven't stuck to it, I've seen 10 pounds worth of weight loss from doing it off and on over the course of a few weeks. I strongly recommend it. It's high intensity, however. It has modifications, but it is incredibly face paced. It requires dedication. If you've experienced any past injuries, it may cause them to flare up. I'm in my 20s and it kicks my butt. I have a lot of past volleyball injuries that it irritates, but it's definitely do able.

I do recommend giving it a shot. If it seems like to much, you may want to talk to a doctor about it. There's a good chance it may be too much. However, if you can handle it, I completely recommend trying it. It's never boring, and Jillian keeps you moving. You feel like you may never move again afterwards sometimes. Be sure to stretch before and after, and even soak in some epsom salt afterwards. Trust me, if you aren't in fantastic shape, you will be sore.

But if you stick with it, you WILL see results. Even though I haven't lost as much weight as I need to, you can watch your body change. You will tone up and build muscle during this. You gain weight before you lose it on this program, but just stick with it. Be sure to add portion control and healthier options, as well.",1469836800,4,1284,4.279835390946502

I did mine as a challenge. 30 days to get a jump start on getting a more toned figure. If you google the program, you can find fun calendars to track your progress. It is recommended that you take measurements before and after so you see your results. I did not do that. I only weighed myself and took the pictures, thinking I want to see what people see. I only lost 2.5 lbs in the 30 days however I lost 3% body fat ! ....then I quickly lost 3 lbs the few days after completing the challenge. I'm definitely leaner even though it may be difficult to see in the photo. Most importantly, I feel stronger ! I encourage anyone just thinking to try it to just do it!

3314976,4,B00127RAJY,"The workouts are pretty good for somebody that doesn't have much time. I'm thin and fairly fit, but I needed a more regular routine and my kids don't really allow me a lot of time to work out. The 20-minute workouts offered here are what drew me in, and even with the short workouts, I do feel my strength and stamina improving. I use this video 2-3 times a week, mixed with running 2-3 times a week. I rarely do this workout on 2 consecutive days, and if I do I don't do the same level. I've found the workouts to be as challenging as you want them to be, and you can modify most movements to accommodate injuries/weaknesses/etc. I'm not out to lose weight, so there are times where I take a break or skip a part I just don't feel motivated for that day-- I'm especially not fond of all the push ups at the beginning of level 1, and the neck circle sin the warm ups make me dizzy! That being said, if you're somewhat fit and putting in some effort, you should progress fairly easily. Sticking to the ""harder"" versions of each exercise, I think I did level one 3-4 times before progressing to level 2. I haven't felt a lot of need to move up to level 3, but went through the first circuit once just to see what's on it. Level 3 is definitely a step up, so it's a good idea to spend some time at level 2 perfecting all that plank work!

My main issue with this is the DVD. There is no way to skip over the intro and just go straight to the menu to choose your workout. Then you have to go through 2 levels of menu. There's no reason anyone should have to watch the intro more than once. I use this time to set up my mat and weights, but I still end up standing around twiddling my thumbs waiting for Jillian to shut up so the menu will come on. For a workout that is supposed to be 20 minutes, adding on a bunch of extra time for the intro is annoying. Also, just to be precise, the workouts are 20ish minutes plus the warm up and cool down-- only an issue if you're crunched for time! Don't expect to start and finish in 20 minutes.",1469059200,4,2032,4.08

3314978,5,B00127RAJY,"I am an ultra busy working mother of two. In other words, I have next to NO time to work out. I really can't even manage 30 mins per day. So my husband and I worked out a deal where we switch off working out while the other tends to the kids. It has now been two months since I got this DVD and started doing the workouts every other day and I am down 10 pounds!!! I can hardly believe it! I'm sure I would have gotten quicker results had I been doing it everyday, but that just wasn't manageable for me. I started out with Level 1 and advanced from there and now I'm just rotating each time I work out. My point is that even if you can't fully commit to Jillian's program you will still see results just at a slower pace. I'm convinced Jillian's 20-30 minute 3-2-1 workout system is THE way to go if you don't have a whole lot of time to commit to physical fitness. Love Jillian!!!",1468972800,2,882,4.045714285714285

3315014,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is one of my favorite workout videos. There are 3 twenty minute workouts each getting increasingly difficult. I love that each workout is short so that when I'm pressed on time I can still exercise and feel like it counted. She says that one of these 20 minute workouts can replace hours of ""phoning it in at the gym"" and I think she's right! When I give it my all I can really tell a difference in my endurance and strength after only a few days.

I always start with workout one, and I do it for about 10 days straight. Then when I'm ready to move on, I go to workout two. I must be honest that workout two is my least favorite of the bunch. There are quite a few floor exercises that make me light headed and dizzy. The exercises work, though, so I force myself through them. There are modifications to each exercise and you can choose which helper to watch and follow- the easier gal or the more advanced gal. One word of caution though- there is no modification for jumping jacks! After awhile I was so proud that jumping jacks weren't as difficult as they were at first. I *almost* enjoy them now!

After about 10 days of two I move on to workout three, and it is so much fun. The exercises chosen for three are great. It's really quite hard, but if you go at your own pace, before you know it it isn't as challenging. I love that I can do this video in the privacy of my own home. My face gets really flushed when I exercise (it embarrasses me) so I'm glad not to have an audience like I would at the gym. I have lost quite a bit of weight by doing this workout video. When I am diligent, I see results really fast. No matter your skill level, this video can help with your fitness, and it's a lot of fun to boot.",1468368000,17,1750,4.129032258064516

3315076,5,B00127RAJY,"My skill level: I am pretty good about doing a home workout DVD about 5-6 times a week. I have tried several of Jillian's programs, several in The Firm series, more Beachbody programs than I care to admit, and a few random ones for good measure (Billy Blanks, prenatal workouts, and a few Bellydance). That being said, I am not athletic. I hate working out but do so because it is the healthy thing to do. I would classify my level as ""lower level advanced"". I am certainly not a beginner but by no means am I a super toned athlete.

As a way to kind of organize my own DVD collection, I wanted to go through and rate them all so I can quickly grab exactly the kind of workout I am looking for that day, rather than try to think ""hmm, is this the good ab one or the good thigh one?"". Posting them here on Amazon for all to benefit from. Here goes:

This review is for the Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred. There is one DVD with 3 different workouts- 3 levels of essentially the same format. The idea is that you do each workout for 10 days. The first time I did it was about a year ago when I had just been cleared to start working out again after I had my son. At that time, it was free to stream on Amazon Prime until I finished the 2nd level but I loved it so much, I ended up buying the DVD.

Time: For each workout, the warm-up and cool down are about 2-3 minutes each. The actual workout is 23ish minutes, so you are looking at a 25-30 minute commitment from start to finish.

Skill Level: This program is perfect for a beginner or someone who is getting back into working out after taking a break. Though I had previously done workouts like Beachbody's ""Insanity"", that was not something I wanted to jump back into after just having a baby.

Though it doesn't seem it at the time, level 1 becomes easy as does level 2 (Still working on Level 3 but I am assuming it will get easier as well)! As with most of JM's workouts, there are always plenty of modifiers to make the workout harder or easier. If you classify your skill level as ""upper intermediate"" or ""advanced"" the first two levels will probably be too easy for you.

Equipment: You will need weights- I recommend a pair of ""light"", ""medium"" and ""heavy"", which, depending on your skill level will be different. For beginners I'd start with a pair of 3-5-8, intermediate would probably use 5-8-10, and advanced 8-10-15 (I used 5-10-15).

Breaks: No breaks. It is a short workout so she keeps you moving pretty much the whole time.

Format: Jillian uses her common 3-2-1 circuit formula: 3 minutes of strength training, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, then one minute of abs. I really love this pattern because it is a way to have a little of everything in a very predictable way. There are 3 different circuits and within each circuit (except abs) each component repeats 2 times.

Overall, I think this is a perfect 30 day program to use as an introduction to working out. I have done a bunch of different programs that range from 30 days to 15 weeks. The longer ones have more variety in workouts, yes, but that is a pretty overwhelming time commitment for someone just starting out on their journey. This program is simple (in terms of the schedule) and predictable (all workouts follow the exact same formula). Once you master this you will certainly want more variety but if you can stick to it for 30 days, you will have created a great daily habit of working out and will be 100% ready for the next level.

Personally, I still use Level 3 in my workout rotation when I am looking for a relatively short comprehensive workout (mix of cardio/strength/abs).",1466208000,3,3621,4.38301043219076

3315120,5,B00127RAJY,"I have never been big on exercise but I put on 25 pounds  in the last 3 years and need to get it off and as I'm aging, I also noticed I need more strength for balance.  I have tried a lot of exercise routines over the last two years but had a very hard time with motivation because change was so slow.  I was really frustrated. I started this about 6 weeks ago and I could see changes almost immediately.  It has been great for motivation and my strength has increased dramatically.  I have finally started to see a decline in my weight.  Would like to have seen that sooner, but at first, I added weight due to the increase in muscle and while I did not go on a diet with this, I found that the program itself has changed my food cravings.  I noticed that some have mentioned knee problems and I don't have those, but I did had issues with my left knee right after I started this.  I realized that when it hurt I was favoring it.  When I stopped doing that and continued to stretch it out during the day, the problem went away after about 2 weeks. I know my limitations too so there are some exercises where I stick to the modified version.  I have tried to maintain this at least 5 days a week.  If I got real sore, I took a day off. All in all, I love the results and I am just finishing up level 3.  I am so pleased I orders ""Ripped in 30"".  For me, this high intensity interval training is perfect.",1465516800,5,1403,4.0398550724637685

A few months ago I quit my gym membership to save money and thought I'd give the 30 Day Shred another try. I'm happy to report it is still as great and tough a workout as I remember! This time around I am more diligent about being consistent and I am seeing major definition in my arms and back, and starting to see definition in my abs!

I appreciate the modifications that are given for the different exercises. (I am currently on level 2 and using most of the modifications - I still sweat like crazy!) I also like how Jillian Michaels isn't the overly bubbly positive cliche - she admits that the workout is difficult and you can tell that she and the other two women in the DVD are working hard. I've been doing the DVD well over the 30 days, and I hope to start Level 3 next week. It's awesome that all you need are a pair of weights and a yoga mat.

3315204,5,B00127RAJY,"Loved it. It took me a few different tries to actually start really doing it. I did it once and it kicked my butt. Then I did it a second time and could not make it through. Then I saw how much i weighed and knew I had to make a change. So I started doing it every day with 5 pound weights. I would do 3 days on 2 days off. The first 2 weeks, there was not much of a change, so I added in 10 minute HIIT 3 times a week. At the end of the program, I had lost 10 pounds. And my body pretty much transformed. I could see more definition, and tone, which means that I had transformed fat and into muscle (which as we all know, weighs more). I think the second level was the hardest but there is when i started seeing more fat burn off. Level 3 I started seeing more tone and lines on my abs. To loose 10 pounds in roughly 30 days is great. Once you really get into the groove of it, and start to memorize the work outs, its not that bad and ends up being a pretty quick 30 minutes.

3315352,5,B00127RAJY,"Well, yesterday I finished day 30 of the 30 day shred. So, today I am ready to give my opinion and results. I am 39 and bought this video because it's time to get in shape after recently having a baby.  Oh yeah, and I never got in shape from the baby I had before the last one. When I started this video I needed to lose 60 pounds in order to reach my desired weight.

Results:
I will say that the results are very noticeable. Everyone keeps asking me if I have lost alot of weight. To be honest, I have only lost 4 pounds, which is disappointing, but it is obvious that I have replaced much fat with muscle. I have lost 1/2"" off my thighs, 2"" off my hips, 3"" off my waist, 2"" off my chest, and 1"" off my arms. My clothes fit much looser than they did 30 days ago and they look much better. Also, I have far more energy and endurance.

My diet:
I did not use Jillian's diet plan. In fact, I did not change my diet much at all. The only thing I have changed is that I have cut soda completely, but I only drank 1-2 sodas a week before starting the program. I also have begun to drink much more water. I messed up a couple of times and ate lots of movie theater popcorn. I cannot stop thinking about how this has impacted my results.

The video:
I really like this video. None of the moves are complicated. The only equipment you will need are some hand weights. You will start with level one and move on to level 2 when you feel ready and then the same with level 3. Each level has a brief warm up, 3 circuits, and a cool down. From beginning to end you will workout for 24 minutes. I will admit that I am not in the best shape, but I am certainly not in the worst. I found this video to be challenging. It took me a week to get through level 1 without pausing. I think I paused 7 times on day one. I honestly paused about 1 less time each day, until I finally didn't need to. I stuck with level 1 for 2 weeks. When I moved on to level 2, I did not need to pause at all. I read many comments about level 2 being the most challenging, but l LOVED level 2. I did level 2 for one week. I also did level 3 for one week. Level 3 is a killer and I enjoyed it less than the other levels, but I made it through without pausing the video.

My plan is to try a video each month (this one was my first), until I lose all the weight. Over the next month, I will be doing the Biggest Loser Cardio Max and then I will post a review with my results of that.",1461628800,20,2441,3.8642714570858283
3315353,5,B00127RAJY,"This is my second time purchasing this dvd! I am purchasing this as a gift for a friend because I am a firm believer in this work out plan. With dieting and implementing this work out two times a day- I lost 37lbs the first month & a half.

I cut added sugars, dairy, and carbs out of my diet. The work outs are short and really get your heart pumping... I sweat so much! I always find myself going back to this routine. I still have a long way to go, out of all the work out plans I've done this has got to be my most favorite.",1461542400,42,528,3.8440366972477062

3315438,5,B00127RAJY,"UPDATE - Hello my fellow workout junkies:) I never stopped working out since. I am currently weighing at 128 LB, toned and my endurance is fantastic. I simply workout 3 days a week, of course use a Jillian Michael home workout video - I have 8 of them and kinda rotate between one another but 30 day shred is always close to my heart and walk/run another day, drink a lot of water and don't forget to take my post workout protein shakes! A total lifestyle change. It all started with this DVD :) So pleased!!

Try it  you will not be sorry.

A little bit about myself (sorry long story, but I promise I have a point :)) - I had a baby 10 months ago and I gained almost 50 pounds during my pregnancy. I was a size 4, 128 pounds and 5 feet, 3.5 inches tall pre pregnancy and I went all the way up to 183 on my last few weeks of gestation. Post-partum, I did lose some weight (my body doing its own thing) and I hit a plateau when I reach 155 pounds. So I started my weight loss mission. I started with the juice masters 7 pounds in 7 days challenge. I read the book, I was totally committed and I completed the program. I lost 5 pounds which was very discouraging weight loss wise but I noticed my skin and my hair was thankful I did the detox. I then went and bought myself a stationary bike. I was scared to use the bike because I was 6.5 months postpartum and I haven't exercised in like 15 months. None  not even a long walk. So I would use the bike for 7 min and I would be out of breadth and had no energy to proceed. A friend suggested I do p90X (I know, dumb idea for someone who has no endurance what so ever!) Anyway, they make you take this fitness test which was painful and scary and I of course failed but that opened the idea and the possibility of a home workout DVD idea. After a lot of research and procrastination, I landed with the 30 day shred. In the meantime just trying to exercise and using the bike few times a week made me lose a few more pounds. I started the 30 day shred when I was 8.5 months postpartum and weighed 145 pounds. I completed level one and though I was going to die the next few days. I couldn't move because my muscles freaked out. I was in a lot of pain and my self-confidence was suffering but I didn't give up. I picked myself up on day 4 and completed level one again. Couldnt work out for the next couple of days but started again day 7, you get the idea. I kept pushing myself and I was in level 2 in another week and a half and in level 3 in another week and half from that. Its been 45 days and I am now 134 pounds, toned in areas I was only dreaming about and my endurance and energy levels have increased dramatically. Guess what, I took the p90x fitness test again (I had too) and yes I passed with flying colors :) Thank you Jillian. Next up  Get ripped in 30 days. Watch for my review there..soon.. :)",1459728000,5,2857,4.031746031746032

The workouts are under 25 minutes, so squeezing something in before work or adding a workout to a busy schedule is possible! It's covers your whole body, and includes some basic free weight work. I would definitely add in some more intense cardio and strength training to your workout routine, but this is great for people looking to get in shape, or more fit people looking for something quick to do on busy days. There are also three different levels, so you can choose between an easier workout and a slightly more strenuous option.

3315453,3,B00127RAJY,"It's okay. It will get your heart rate up and you will probably lose weight if you use this program.

I docked two stars for one simple reason: every time I do this workout, I inevitably end up with some kind of injury, either my knee or my back. I've used this program several times over the years - two babies, wanting to lose the baby weight, shape up for a wedding, etc etc. I know all about proper form, it's not that. There's some move that she does that if you have even a slightly sensitive low back or knees, you're likely to end up injured.

Also, Jillian Michaels knows nothing about building a feminine physique, if that's something you're worried about. She builds bulky quads and wide shoulders. It's fine if you're looking to quickly slim down; the areas she bulks you can fix with better programs (like Tracy Anderson, or Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful), but if you're looking to build a femininely toned body *while* you slim down, look elsewhere.

In short: this program is okay. If you don't get hurt, you will probably lose weight and build muscle in your legs and shoulders. But, if your goals are bigger than just lose weight ASAP, you can find better programs.",1459296000,2,1188,4.542056074766355

3315455,5,B00127RAJY,"I started this expecting nothing, mostly because I always told myself I had tried everything. To be completely honest I began many programs and never really stuck longer then 2 weeks tops. I tried running, and calorie restriction, weight watchers, and a ridicual amount of Beach Body workouts. I hated the Beachbody because they were so long and seemed to cause more soreness then results. There were so many addons and meals you had to pay for, I just got tired of it real quick. But this DVD went by quickly, I loved how there are three circuits, So by the second one I could tell myself half way through! The time flew, by the second week I told myself I am giving up. But I thought about it and thought I will stick it out. I didn't really see results until the middle of the 2nd week, by the 3rd week all my work pants were lose, by the 4th week everyone at my work had noticed and said ""Wow you have lost so much weight!"" I couldn't believe it! I was the one that had lost the weight! I didn't even follow the mealplan, I told myself I wanted to teach myself how to eat on my own without always following a diet, instead I eat almost all organic and hormone free food, and watch my portions. I try to eat 4-5 times a day. And avoid anything fake, and cook all of my meals. I am beyond impressed and feel so happy! I can't believe after years I actually saw a difference. I didn't weigh myself because I thought I would self sabotage myself and obsess about the numbers. But my clothes speak volumes! The pants I couldn't even wear last June, I had to dig out and wear because all my other pants were so lose! Now by the 4th week, those pants are lose too!!!!! I am so happy and proud of myself! I can't believe I did all 30 days. I worked out 6 days and one day off. I didn't even have wieghts because I couldn't afford them so I used bean cans, lol. They still worked! I did 10 days on level 1, 10 days on level 2, and 10 days on level 3.

If you are reading all the reviews and looking at as many before and after photos as you can just do it. Take the plunge you will not regret it. You will feel beautiful strong and that you can accomplish anything!! Do it!!!!!

I am now on my second day of the ripped in 30 and love it even more! I am hoping to finally get down to a size 7!!! and dress size 6!! I just need to tone a bit more and lose that last layer on my tummy! I really feel like I can do it and by the 30 day mark I will be amazingly pleased. I intend to combine the ripped in 30 with at least two days hiking, and sometime within the 30 days I will also throw in the one week shred, which I may do for 2 weeks to maximize my transformation and to get rid of that top belly layer. I haven't seen hardly any results or pictures for Ripped in 30 but, after the 30 day shred I am conviced. Really fitting into pants that haven't fit for over a year??!?!?!? and when I did wear them they were super tight on my abdomen. I can't wait to fit into those skinnny jeans I bought months ago. I actually tried them on and was able to button them, they are far too tight to wear them comfortably, but the point here is that I was able to get them past my thighs!!! and button them, which I couldn't before!!! :D Do IT!!!!!! You can do anything if you really want it, but not for anyone else, for youself! I tried to workout in the past in my mind I wanted to look better for my husband but, I never followed through. This time I'm doing it for me, and I actually finished it through and am so very proud!! Do It!! You won't be sorry",1459209600,14,3538,4.002828854314003

3315533,5,B00127RAJY,"I started the 30 day shred on New Years Day 2016. Since then, I have done this workout 5 days a week, and I spent 2 weeks at each level.

This workout kicks ass! Especially if you are a beginner like me. I feel like I get a great workout every time, and it feels amazing to see the changes in my body. I was relatively small to begin with (135 pounds, 5'4), but I dropped down to my goal weight of 128 using the shred and without changing my diet. (I don't drink pop, I have one coffee a day and then the rest is either water or unsweetened tea, I have desserts maybe one day a week -- so my diet wasn't terrible to begin with, but I haven't really changed anything).

The biggest changes for me have come in my ability to do things I couldn't do in the beginning. I went from not being able to do a push-up to being able to do 20 in a row. I went from being sore and winded every workout to feeling great every workout. These workouts really do amp up at each level, but they are do-able in this progression. I was sore the first few days after each new level.

Also, I personally love Jillian, so her personality has never been a problem for me.

Overall, I would highly recommend this to a beginner wanting to get in shape without devoting hours of your time. I am a doctoral student with very limited free time, but I have been able to fit this in! I feel more confident in myself than ever. Thanks Jillian!

EDITED TO ADD: I am now doing the shred level 3 twice a week, and ""No More Trouble Zones"" 3 days a week. I was more than ready to start No More Trouble Zones after I finished the shred.",1457740800,5,1598,4.044303797468355

Jillian gives great advice, talks about form, and gives modifiers to make the exercises either easier or harder, depending on your fitness level. This DVD has 3 levels of full-body workouts based on her 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs strategy (which TOTALLY WORKS). Quick full workouts saves me time and keeps me fit. I rotate a lot through her DVDs to fight boredom, and do lower levels with heavier weights, higher levels with lighter weights (or push hard on higher levels with heavier weights to keep my body guessing). When I workout consistently with her DVDs, I get a well defined 6 pack. Totally worth it and I highly recommend",1456704000,3,769,4.460992907801418

I shopped around for some fitness dvd to start working out at home in the mornings. I finally settled on the 30 day shred. Shipping was super fast and I was eager to pop it in and give it a try.  The only equipment you need for this are hand weights (dumbbells) and a yoga mat if you're going to be doing this on a hard surface. I love that I didn't have to run out and buy a ton of extra stuff. The dvd starts out with and introduction to jillian then you select from three workouts. Level 1. Level 2. And level 3. Today I did level one. By the time we were done I was sweating from head to toe! She starts off with some warm-ups then you get right into a variety of exercises then you do static stretches to calm down. Jillian has two women behind her. One you follow if you're like me and not in shape and need to start a little easier. The other if you're in shape but looking to work out at home. The exercises were simple but I'm sore already! I read alot of reviews saying people with previous knee issues couldn't do this because it was too strenuous. I will say I do not have knee issues but I think if you do this might be too much for you. It's alot of getting up and down.

3315599,5,B00127RAJY,"I ordered 30 day shred after my best friend suggested it to me.  I noticed she was looking wonderful and I asked her what exercises she was doing.  She told me that she was using this DVD.  I ordered this in January 2015.  I have been using the DVD every morning for over a month.  At first I started on level one.  I noticed within a couple of weeks I was mastering it well, so I decided to go up to level 2.  I have been doing level 2 for the last 1 1/2 months.  I love the weight training and resistance moves.  They are not only allowing me to lose weight, but are adding muscle and trimming me down.  I have lost close to 10 pounds, and I am much more tone and fit.  I love the combination of strength and cardio.  I am not an exercise nut...I like to say I exercise so I can have a cookie later...Just to give you and idea of where I am coming from.  Great dvd...I am going to order another, more advanced Jillian DVD so I can improve even more.

Update, I just got on the scale this morning and have lost another pound.  I am using ""My Fitness Pal"" on my iPhone to log my calories, and walk the dog a couple times a day...but honestly, this DVD is my main work out.  I am now using 5 pound weights in each arm when I do the strength training.  That is making me work harder, but isn't killing me.  Keep in mind, I worked up to the 5 pounds.  I started with 2 pound weights.  My core is so much stronger, and I feel as if I can hold myself up better, sit better, walk better, and just feel so much better.  I plan on moving to level 3 in a couple of weeks if all things go well.  I will keep reporting how I do.",1456185600,7,1617,3.895705521472393

3315666,5,B00127RAJY,If you stick with it you will get results.  I love the fact that the work outs are only 20 minutes because I can always find time to do it and don't get the urge to quick halfway through like I would with longer videos.  You might be sore after the first day and have noticeably more muscle after 2 weeks. You'll gain muscle mass so you might not lose actual pounds but you will lose fat and therefore look trimmer.,1455494400,3,415,4.111111111111111
3315667,4,B00127RAJY,"I didn't have much of an opinion either way on JM before this video. After this video I really like Jillian Michael's method of coaching. She is motivating and to the point without being preachy.
Ok- so I bought this b/c I wanted to get back into shape. I have always been an athlete and ran/worked-out on/off for most of my adult life since I stopped doing competitive sports after H.S./College but needed something to get me back into it. I picked this up based on reviews and a good price/easy to do at home. I love the 3-2-1 method that keeps you going and mixes up the workouts and I love the truly fast 20 minutes b/c I have no excuses to do this 5-6 days a week. I wanted to tone and get stronger and hopefully lose about 5lbs. Now, after almost 3 full weeks I have lost about 2lbs and 1-1.5 inches from my waist and hip area. I definitely feel much stronger and have better endurance. This does work and I think if you stick with it and wanted to lose more weight than I am aiming for it would work, especially with a diet modification plan. I have not changed my eating at all but am still seeing some results. I will hopefully reign in my eating more so I can actually shed the 5lbs I would like to...maybe even more?!
Couple more things: Wish that each level offered 2 work-outs just for variation but I will say that each video offers a way for you to keep working but modify for your own needs. I have not great knees from years of wear and tear and I currently do have a torn rotator cuff so I am careful during some moves to really listen to my body- but overall I am able to do 85-90% of the workouts at my full capacity.  L1 I was able to complete confidently in less than a week and same with  L2. I then returned back to L1 and found it significantly easier after completing my 2nd full week (last week on L2)! So exciting to see progress. Also, I do find that L2 is a bit tough on the joints (shoulders/knees) due to the moves but L3 eases up on that but is much tougher on actual muscle toning moves with more resistance.
Overall I like this and will continue to do and probably get another one of her 20 minute DVD's to mix it up.",1455321600,7,2152,4.133651551312649

The workouts - man. If you are new to exercising, just keep going. I was DYING on my first day and took breaks and couldn't keep up. But the workout actually goes by really quickly. There are three rounds each consisting of 2 minutes of strength (push ups, chest press, shoulder press type workout outs), 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, butt kicks, jumping rope etc.) and 1 minute of ab workouts (different types of crunches or sit ups). The cardio part is what really killed me at first. Now I am able to jump around with them and not be too bothered by it. Of course, then it changes to the next level (there are 3) so you don't plateau. Overall, I have done this program for a month and it helped me lose 4 1/2 inches of my waist, 1 inch off both thighs, and 1/2 inch off my arms!

Sadly on day 3 I had to take a break because my calves hurt to the point that I was limping :( I think it is because there is a lot of jumping and very little stretching I'll skip day 4 and 5 because it is pretty much a repeat of soreness but with a strict diet and this DVD I have lost 4 pounds in 5 days :) I am now 5'4 and 145 pounds.

I trying to work out 3-4 times a week and I like how this work out is fast and intense. I don't usually have an hour to spend working out so I feel like these work outs are amazing for 20 minutes and really get my blood pumping.

I run and do other sports but this workout always sculpts my body so quickly.  Better than any other workout that I do.  Her training is AMAZING.  The results are worth the sweat.  This is a challenging DVD, but, you can make it as challenging as you want.  I never saw my body change with any other workout like it does with her type of training.  She is really driven and will make you work for it but I promise, you won't be disappointed.  It is 20 minutes.

3315775,5,B00127RAJY,"I have a few of Jillian's DVDs, and this is one of my favorites! It's a tough, fast-paced workout that will leave you sweaty and panting.

There are three 20-minute workouts, each with a different difficulty level. And although the moves are all simple and easy to understand, there is a definite difference between levels. Even the level 1 is pretty tough (and I consider myself very athletic and in good shape), and the level 3 is KILLER (don't try it before you do levels 1 and 2 a few times). You do short circuits of weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, cardio, and abs. It goes by so fast (and saves me so much time compared to going to the gym every day), but it is a serious workout and if you stick with it, you'll see results. I didn't need or want to lose weight when I started these, but after two months of doing them 4-6 times per week, I had dropped 5 lbs and a pant size. So I was very happy with it!

However, if you get bored easily doing the same thing over and over, this may not be the DVD for you. I really don't mind it, and I like to mix it up by doing the different levels, increasing my weight, or adding weights to the cardio part. But it may get tedious for some people.",1453766400,4,1198,4.181818181818182

I have worked with a trainer on and off for several years and this DVD is the closest one I've had that comes to the same actual type of workout you do with a personal trainer. The workout is pretty fast paced, but I found the first level to not be too difficult even for being completely out of shape after having a baby.  They even offer an easier and harder version of most exercises so you can take it to the level you feel comfortable with.

I knocked off one star because the commercials at the beginning when you start the DVD are annoying and will not let you skip to the main menu. I would recommend popping in the DVD and then go get ready for your workout so the DVD is ready to go when you are.",1453680000,13,738,4.041095890410959

I go to the gym about 4 days a week and do the about an hour on the elliptical, bike and weight machines.  My weight has plateaued and my endocrinologist suggested changing up my routine (I have hypothyroidism).  I picked up the One Week Shred that was on clearance and couldn't get through 10 minutes.  It was BRUTAL.  I remembered how effective this DVD was and decided to buy on amazon. Just started and it is as good as I remember.  20 minutes and I am done, sweating and feeling a good soreness in my muscles.

3315795,1,B00127RAJY,"Update: SO NOT AWESOME. I never did get the DVD to not play the commercials even with suggestions from other reviews. However, after working my way up to level 3, and doing jumping jacks with weights, I am now in physical therapy 3 times a week. The first time I saw Jillian do jumping jacks with weights, I did not follow. I have been weight training on/off most of my adult life and never have I done any type of aerobics with weights. I even told my husband I thought this was absurd and dangerous. Then I decided to try it, against my best judgement. And, I should have listened to myself. On top of now having bursitis and needing a cortisone shot in my shoulder, I cannot do any weight lifting or any type of exercise with my arms because I have damaged my shoulder doing this video. I DO NOT recommend doing any cardio with the weights!

This is not for content, but the fact that it takes forever to load every time. I have to sit and watch the commercials for the biggest loser, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I just want to start my workout, not watch commercials. I try to fast forward but it resets my DVD player and I have to start it all over again. Such a waste of time.

If you stick with it after only 2 weeks you will start to see results.  I feel firmer but I'm not getting on the scale for another 2 weeks so not sure about pounds.  I think it's going to take me longer because I just can't do some of the jumping due to bad knees and a bad back.  Sorry, Jill, I modify somewhat and do the best I can.  I don't cheat really, just substitute running in place as fast as I can which seems easier on the knees and back for the jumping in place, but I do every one of the jumping jacks.  I've knocked off a star because there really needs to be alternate movements given for those of us who aren't young or have injuries. What'ja say?  Go back to Jane Fonda you old thing??  No way!!  Love Jillian and I can't find my legwarmers or my leotards.",1452988800,13,945,3.9365079365079363

I purchased this with a couple other DVDs to try to drop 5-10 pounds which I had accumulated as I neared my 40's and my metabolism seemed to have slowed. I think this is a fantastic dvd which works the entire body. Nothing was too difficult to follow due to ability or coordination. I know that everyone has a different body type and what is good for one may not benefit another but in abt 6 weeks I was able to drop 7 pounds. I did this 3 times a week and started being more careful with what I ate. (I love candy.) I was 137 pounds when I started 5'7 if that info helps to know body type. I put on weight everywhere not just one area. Anyhow, I really enjoyed this workout and that is saying something for me. There are three levels I think but I did the first one and occasionally the second. The only equipment needed are some 1 to 3 lbs hand weights (but not necessary) and maybe a yoga mat to lay on for a hard surface.",1452902400,2,1017,4.03960396039604

Unfortunately, 1 week into the DVD series, I threw my back out, badly. I had never had back issues before this. I couldn't move and had to be assisted to do basic tasks like using the restroom with my husbands help. Extremely painful and it took about 3 weeks to fully heal. I am not blaming it on this DVD but please be aware, especially if you have had children recently, you may want to strengthen your core first. I had three kids in 6 years, my core is shot which I think is what caused me\y lower back to give out. I am going to attempt this again AFTER I do her ab DVD in hopes I can strengthen my lower back and abdomen.

3315849,5,B00127RAJY,"I'd like to start off by saying that I rarely review anything on Amazon. In order for me to do so, I have to really like the product. I LOVE this video.
I have been trying to lose weight, but more importantly get fit. I don't want to be skinny, I want to be strong. Jillian's video will make you work! I am about 3 weeks in and I'm still on level 1. Not because I think that level 2 will be too difficult, I am confident I can do it, however I want to do all the advanced versions of the moves and I am gradually increasing dumbbell weight. I essentially started as a couch potato, which had about 20 Lbs to lose I'm 5'10'' tall. I did the first three days without any hand weights. After that, I began using water bottles, just for my hands to become accustomed to the weight. Now I am using 3 lb weights and I will go up to 5 lbs. As far as results go, I can honestly see huge improvement. First off in my fitness level, I panted when I began working out, now I pant less. I still curse every single time I do jumping jacks, however, I do them without stopping. Secondly, I see a change on my clothes and inches lost. I lost about 3 - 4 inches around my belly in these few weeks, and together with following a plan provided by Itrackbites app, I lost about 6 lbs. Overall I am very happy with this workout, and I will update my review when I am close to finishing level 2.
I highly recommend you try this if you're on the edge. Also, it's free on YT without the 10 min intro.",1452038400,14,1477,3.9932432432432434

3315855,5,B00127RAJY,"Everything I have to say about this DVD has probably already been said, but I thought I'd throw my two cents in. I am not an avid exerciser. Never have been. I'm tall and due to some fabulous genetics (thanks, Mom and Dad), I've always been on the thin side naturally without having to exert much effort. But I've never been strong, or toned, and I lacked any and all endurance or cardio fitness which is quite dangerous as heart disease runs in my family. I finally decided enough was enough a couple of months ago and buckled down with this workout.

And it worked. Take it from someone who honestly doesn't enjoy working out - the 30 Day Shred IS DOABLE. And it is effective. It hurts, don't get me wrong. As Jillian says on many occasions, results don't come for free. But they do come! I stuck with all three levels for 10 days each, taking a rest day every 5 or 6 days, so it took me a bit over a month but I lost 6-7 inches total (mostly around my waist, hips and arms) and 3-5 lb. As I said, I didn't have a ton of weight to lose anyway and that wasn't my goal. But the best part? Feeling fit, and strong, and having more energy! And being toned overall. I can see muscles without flexing that didn't exist before! Not only that, but my core is stronger which equals less back pain (I have had back problems for years). For less than 30 minutes a day, it's nothing short of miraculous and worth every minute of swearing at the TV.

I'm about to start her Ripped in 30 tomorrow and I can't wait to see what further results it brings. Jillian has certainly made me a believer. Stick with it, eat right (as much as possible) and it will work for you too!",1451865600,10,1659,4.197492163009405

I'm sorry but if they GAVE me this DVD, I could tolerate the ads (although I must admit that I am inspired by trim, fit people doing the exercises and not the folks who are still 100 lbs short of healthy).  Anyway, I am giving this Biggest Loser of a DVD to the library where most unsuspecting souls will not even try it the first time UNLESS they can figure out how to get past the ads.

If you like this DVD, please try Ripped in 30 as it is essentially the same style of workouts, but much improved over this DVD. I think Ripped in 30 has better warm-ups and cool-downs (slightly longer), as well as 3 strength moves per circuit vs 2, which makes it go by a lot quicker. I feel like I always get a better workout with Ripped in 30, for the same amount of time. Not that 30 Day Shred is a bad dvd, just that Ripped in 30 is better.",1451347200,23,621,3.976

After having my 5th child and not doing much exercising during my pregnancy, I suffered from weak knees and a lot of extra weight. After trying to run, my knees were extremely sore and not able to handle the extra weight. I needed a lower impact way to get the weight off and build up my stamina. This workout is great for that. It's very low impact but gets you sweating and helps build up your stamina and get that muscle tone back. You only do a 30 minute workout on each level so it's fairly easy to make time for it during your day. You can't take any breaks during it though because if you want those 30 minutes to be effective you have to work for it. I've definitely noticed an increase in muscle tone after only two weeks as well as a huge increase in stamina. I've even lost about 4 lbs in these two weeks (combined with a health, low carb diet) Definately recommend this workout video for those trying to get back on the habit of exercising or those with injuries that want a low impact but effective workout.",1450310400,4,1112,4.270142180094787

If I felt like I couldn't do a move, or needed a minute to breathe, I would march in place and jump back in once I had pulled it back together.

I have one complaint, and that is that when Jillian has us do jumping jacks, she says that everyone can do jumping jacks and there are no excuses for getting out of them. I don't know, but I'm guessing she hasn't had a baby as that has completely shot mine and my mother's ability to jump and not pee ourselves. I think this is a good reason to not do jumping jacks.

Lol it kind of just solidified my body mass and I'm trying to slim down here lol (replaced fat w/ muscle tone). It was A LOT of arm exercises. I needed more toning in my stomach and thighs. It just really fatigued and stressed out my body, it's really not worth it for someone who is trying to lose weight, there are better options out there. I stuck with it but eventually after 28 days and not seeing much results I was over it. I'm pretty healthy outside of this workout so maybe this wasn't going to show much results in me? but still I feel this isn't the best option; I definitely didn't  feel motivated to work out and she started to annoy me. I should have known from her body type though; it might work for someone with a straight up and down body but regardless of that, I don't think this is a great idea for people who want to get in shape fast; not the most effective cardio/muscle strengthening. It didn't burn as much as stretch me in awkward positions that eventually strained my knee cap and arm socket. I'm sure if you had the correct form lol yeah it might help but they weren't very easy to follow sometimes so if you're body is unlike any form represented there, then you might actually strain yourself.

3316096,4,B00127RAJY,"I am a lazy person.  I do not like to work out.  The only way I will work out is if I roll out of bed and work out first thing in the morning, when my brain is too asleep to realize what my body is doing. I've been doing this DVD on and off for about a year, and in the past 2 months have really stepped up my game and been doing it diligently Monday - Friday.  I have noticed results - specifically, my stamina has greatly improved, my arms and thighs have toned up, and my abs/core have definitely gotten stronger. I used to get winded running to my mailbox, which is maybe a city block away.  Now I can run 3/4 of a mile before stopping.  That's incredible for a girl who managed to skirt through high school without ever actually running a lap in gym.

So I'm sure you probably already know this from other reviews or the product info itself, but there are three workouts in here, Levels 1-3.  You're supposed to do each level for 10 days, combining it with her meal plan for maximum weight loss (unfortunately her meal plan didn't involve eating an entire Costco pizza by yourself so I kindly had to pass on that section).

She says they're 20 minutes, but they're actually 30 minutes once you factor in the warm up and cool down (I mean, you're not supposed to skip those so they should count, right?).  The first week will be the worst - you will wish you were dead (if you're like me, you might also wish Jillian were dead).  You will be sore for a few days afterwards. The first week of Level 1 feels like what I think getting beat up by Batman would feel like.  I actually shed a few tears the first night because I hurt so bad (true story).  But if you keep it up you'll notice that slowly, jumping jacks are a little less awful.  And the push ups never get easy, but they get easier.

I would recommend

- Definitely checking in with your doctor before you start. I sprained my chest last December and had to take a break for several months (look it up, chest muscle injuries are one of the slowest to heal!).  So I really strongly recommend a sports bra if you're going to do all the jumping jacks, jump rope, rock star jumps and butt kicks she wants you to do.  I would also check in with a doctor if you have questions about your knees, because she will basically destroy them if you're not careful.

- Bringing your own music once you get the routines down, as it really makes them go by faster.  And it helps if you have a partner to hold you accountable.

The important thing is to just develop the habit of doing it - whether you do it in the morning like me or after everyone has gone to bed.  Whatever time works best for you, just keep at it.  It takes 30 days or so to build a habit and only missing it once or twice to break it!  This is a great habit to develop, don't give up on yourself.

So the real question that everyone's probably wondering: am I ripped?  No.  You might call me ""roughly in the shape of a healthy person"", but definitely not ripped.  I'm not in any danger of having six pack abs or buns of steel (though I think you could probably get ripped with this, if you were unlike me and willing to give up ice cream). Am I healthier?  Definitely - along with the aforementioned benefits above, I just feel healthier.  I (believe it or not!) seek out healthier foods, I take the stairs instead of the escalator. It's tough to explain, but I think Jillian says it best: when you're disciplined and work out, then you'll be disciplined in other areas of your life as well.

Let me be clear here: I do not actually like the workout itself, but I AM enjoying the impact it's having on my life and health.",1445904000,12,3639,4.194244604316546
3316097,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian will kick your but.  I had this DVD before but lost it in a move and I knew I had to replace it.  It works great.  You will lose weight if you keep up with it.  When first starting this I will take 2-3 weeks before moving up to the next phase, it takes me longer than the 30 days but sometimes my body just isn't ready for the next phase and it's great that I can help set my own pace.

I love that it is only 30 minutes.  Usually Jillian's DVDs are longer than that and it makes it hard to fit in during a busy work week.  But I know I can spare a half an hour a day for my health.  Her 3:2:1 system is great so you know what to expect.  3 minutes of cardio.  2 minutes of strength.  And 1 minute of ab work.  It's not easy your muscles will feel it the next day and you might not thing that you can do it again but you can and you will get through it.  Stick with it (I cheat and sometimes take a day or 2 off during the week) and you will notice results.  You will drop pounds, loose inches and the work out will start to get easier.  Level up when you think you are ready and if you try and aren't give it another week and try again.

Jillian is a good motivator without being annoying, she doesn't have that super cheery fitness instructor personality that annoys me to no end.  She has good cuing and will help keep you on pace and on track.

This is one of my favorites.  I know I can do it (and I'm not in great shape), I know that it will work if I stick with it.",1445904000,,1480,3.7934426229508196

I stayed on the first level for about 30 days before moving on, but that's because I was starting from scratch.

Workout is a butt-kicking 20 minutes that will shred you nicely. Obviously if it's a recorded workout there will be repetition. But if you go to an exercise class at a gym do you think the instructor doesn't repeat himself there too?

I typically run 1-2 miles everyday, not a huge exerciser, but try to keep the old ticker pumping blood and making the doctor happy.  Since using this video, much of my back and shoulder pain has been eliminated, my posture is getting far better than is has been in years and I am starting to feel solid.  The 3 different workouts are fantastic and work the entire body.  I have done all levels and they can get progressively harder, but not so much that you can't do it with modifications.  To make the lower levels harder, use heavier weights.  This video has kept me motivated and how can anyone not find just 20 minutes to do this video?  Even on the days that I can't get myself to run, I do this video.  Jillian Michaels has some great exercise videos.  I love the fact the the 2 ladies who are in the video have different figures than Jillian so you can see other shaped ladies who are fit.  Of course when you hear her say that 400 pound people can do the same exercises, you realize you can do it too.",1444003200,2,1086,4.177884615384615

Beginners, please pace yourself. You won't do every single move. But keep going. If you're out of breath or fatigued, rest a few sec. By day 4 or 5, you'll see a big difference in your endurance. My knees are demanding a little break right now, but I'm getting right back on the horse bec I def notice my body tightening up. My muscles are popping. My legs are hard. Couples with my reduced cal intake, this video has helped me go from 201.4 to 195.8 the first week. It changed the way I work out. I want effectiveness. I'll def buy more videos from her.

3316254,5,B00127RAJY,"Love this video! I'm pretty lazy when it comes to working out--once it starts to burn/hurt, I tend to give up and think I've done enough. I've been using the x9i treadmill powered by Jillian, but I still felt lazy even using that. I'm 35, 5'2"", about 115 pounds give or take a pound, so I'm by no means overweight, but I feel pretty flabby in the thigh/butt area. We are going to Bora Bora next month and are planning to start trying to have a baby in a few months, so I figured I'd better get started on some sort of routine. This is perfect! I love that it's divided up into three circuits for each of the three levels. It tells my brain, just one more, just one more. When I'm about burned out, I tell myself abs are next and I get to lie down! That's enough to keep me going through to the end each time! So, after the very first day, my body hurt in so many places it has never hurt before--which excited me! I knew which places the exercises were targeting then! It's been 10 days, and I've done it for 8 of the past 10 days. I actually look forward to doing it. It's so easy to squeeze in because it's only 25 minutes warm up to cool down.

3316257,4,B00127RAJY,"Highly effective. However, if you have done other Jililan Michaels work outs, this one is a little different in that each set is done for 1 minute vs. 30 second increments. While this does not seem like a big deal, it takes some adjusting and I personally like the 30 second increments. Also, this must be one of Jillian's 1st videos because the music and work out clothes are from the early 2000s. As long as you can move past that, it is a great work out, really fast, and you feel great after!",1442880000,,496,4.287234042553192

I like the encouraging things she says: ""You can't expect to work out for 20 minutes and see results if you take breaks"" or ""If you think you're going to die, follow Anita (the fitness model doing the easier moves)"". It's definitely geared toward women, but this would work for anyone. I've been doing it a week, and I'm still sore! The first few days were the worst, but it's getting easier. I started at level 1, since my fitness level was poor. I'm 234 lbs and trying to lose my pregnancy weight. My baby (7.5 months old) tolerates me doing this. :-) Either I put him near me, and he enjoys being under my face when I do push up (makes him giggle) or trying to grab the weights out my hands during chest flies (also makes him giggle), or I put him in the doorway jumper and he jumps along with me.

What I don't like is how everyone thinks its going to be a miracle and after 30 days you are going to look like a sculpted (shredded) god or goddess. If you aren't doing a meal plan with it (or at least being more mindful) you aren't going to lose weight and look different. You do gain muscle and it is great feeling the workouts get easier so you can move on to the next levels. There are three levels. Each level gets harder and demands more.

What I love about this dvd is that it has different levels. You have your beginner, intermediate, and advanced. If you feel like gotten use to one level move on to the next. Also, I love that Jillian understands not everyone that starts working out is on the same level. She has two women on the workout for you to follow. One that does the workout on a beginner level and the other that does it on an advanced level. Also don't get fooled because there are woman on this workout. This workout can be just as challenging for men. I've gained weight again and this time I'm starting at 210.

I tried level two but felt I wasn't strong enough. I'm also heavy chested and don't want to bulk up my upper body so Instead of doing a lot of the upper body exercises I do squats with the weights and for abs I only do the bicycles crunches.

3316446,5,B00127RAJY,"This is my first time buying a Jillian Michael's DVD. I have currently completed 20 days of the 30 day shred and still going. I complete a level 4-5 days of the week. Let me start by saying that my original goal was to lose 25 pounds, be healthier, and get more in shape. In the last 20 days, I have only lost 5 lbs. A lot of people, like me, will look at that number and think that's nothing this DVD must not work. However, I also have been measuring my inches as I have gone along and have lost almost 10 inches overall. I have gone down an entire clothing size (pants and shirts) and feel much stronger. Even when I walk I can feel that my legs are much stronger than before. I have to say that this DVD has changed my mindset. I am going to start looking at the inches that I lose instead of the pounds.

It has always been difficult for me to lose and maintain lost weight. Therefore, if I change my mindset to becoming stronger and healthier, then I think it will be easier for me. In addition to doing the DVD as my workout I am also doing a blood type diet. There are a lot of people that say this diet is not good and it doesn't work. However, ever since starting it I have felt much better, more energy, less hungry so often, and my digestive health has improved.

So also realize that I am VERY out of shape. I started Level 1 of the DVD and thought OMG I am never going to make it through this. I was doing the modified moves and about died. I pushed forward and continued to do Level 1 for the next week. Then I moved on to Level 2 feeling the same way of how I originally felt of Level 1. I thought there is no way it can be much more difficult. Then I completed Level 2, my face blood red, dripping sweat, and my little girl asking me ""Are you ok? Are you going to die?"" And I thought, yes I am about to die. I continued back and forth between Level 1 & 2. The reason for doing this was to give me a break and a different workout so that I would not get bored. Then one day I tried Level 3. I am still working on mastering Level 3. I continue to do most of the modified moves and am always pouring sweat and sore when I am done. Again, I will still rotate all three levels when I am very sore or just tired of the same workout. I am still benefiting from Level 1 although I now feel it is much easier (hence I am getting stronger).

One warning that I will say is that my knees are always sore after every workout and I have no knee problems. I don't know if my muscles are sore or if I am hurting my knees. There are a lot of squats and lunges. I am completing these correctly so it is not an error in my move. Therefore if you have any knee issues then I would not recommend this DVD. I am finally able to start including some cardio into my workouts besides the DVD and hope to see even greater results soon. If anything, this DVD has made me much stronger and have a higher self-esteem because of how great it makes me feel.",1439251200,8,2944,3.9695945945945947
3316447,2,B00127RAJY,"okay, I'm kind of bummed!! I purchased this from the store to change up my workouts I've been doing Autumn Calabrese 21 day fix not the eating plan just the workout for about 4 weeks now and I love it, so when I saw this I thought cool something new. The workout intensity is hard but when I was finished I felt like I did nothing to be proud of or even feel like i worked hard I also wear a calorie counter and I only burned 112 calories during level 1 Autumn Calabrese I burn 315 . Maybe I need to move up to level two but I've just started my weight loss journey I'm not in the best shape though I'm trying but I am still over weight.

They are hard workouts, but her words stay with you  so you want to do them again. I still run, and use the elliptical, but using weights are new to me.

3316487,5,B00127RAJY,"This has been the very first exercise DVD I have attempted to do and actually completed. Generally, speaking I'm fundamentally lazy and having lived a sedentary lifestyle most of my life, at the time I picked this DVD up I found it extremely difficult to exercise, I have never tried a circuit training before at least not at home and I remember being extremely sore for 2 days after doing Level 1 Only! But I pushed myself to complete the first 10 days and It has really changed my outlook on fitness all together. Yes, It helped me lose weight a considerate amount of course while monitoring my diet as well, but most importantly I'm grateful for the fact that I became a healthier person because of this One DVD.

For those of you just starting your health and fitness journey, please give it a try. I usually find exercise routines a tad boring and hard to follow through, but In My opinion 30 day shred was Enjoyable for the most part and is relatively easy that even a person who's over 200 Ibs can manage to follow at least modified version of the exercises so I would surely recommend it for a start.",1438041600,2,1108,4.431372549019608

I have level 1 and level 3. I liked both, and I though level 3 was only a little harder bit than level 1. I have done Jillian's six week six pack, and I thought that level 3 was easier than that.

The moves are pretty repetitive, but you get a good workout of your arms, thighs, and core. If you combine this with cardio, and strength training you can really see a difference in tone and definition.",1437696000,2,610,4.109243697478991

We haven't tried level 2 or 3 yet but I know those will work. You definitely have to push yourself. After a few straight days of doing level one, it was easier for me. Not super easy, but just enough for it to not suck as much. The only downside with the workouts is that if you have bad knees, this DVD may not be the best for you. Or, you can always switch it up so it's not so hard on the knees. It's just a lot of getting down on the floor and then getting up. (I haven't done level 2 or 3, but I watched them and those have a lot that has to do with the knees). As for the downside with the DVD, it's annoying that every time you want to do a workout, you have to listen to the beginning speech from Jillian before being able to get to the title menu.

With a little one now, it takes a lot to muster up the energy and desire to go get in a good sweat at the gym....especially when there's a cute little baby at home whom I'd rather spend time with.

This DVD gets my vote for squeezing in a quick sweat session during nap time.  There are three 20 minute workouts, each level increasing in difficulty, but each level provides a quality exercise in a short amount of time.  With a 20 minute workout sitting in front of me, I find no excuse to not pop it in every couple of days.  This DVD has a great blend of strength, cardio and abs in a quick manner and even allows time to squeeze in a shower post workout!

I highly recommend this DVD for ANYONE looking to get in a quick sweat session at home.  Whether a beginner, experienced, new mommy, or someone looking for a quick alternative to the gym, this is it.  The price is great and definitely a worthwhile purchase.",1437004800,5,1073,4.246305418719212

I will say, don't be discouraged if you do try this and you don't lose a ton of weight. If you finish it out, it'll appear like you've lost more than you actually have because of the muscle you gain from the program. Pay more attention to your appearance than the scale.

Level Two is challenging for me because I have to bad shoulders and there is mostly shoulder work from plants to military lifts. A lot of upper body. But again, you go at your own pace.
My one big complaint is the Promo at the beginning of the tape. It is LONG and you can't fast forward. Every time you workout you have to wait for the lengthy promo to end.

I was obviously sore the first week. This DVD is composed of three levels and my goal was to move into each level after 10 days. You can move to level 2 or 3 as you feel comfortable. Even when I finished level 3, I kept going and sometimes I would do the workouts twice a day. I did not follow a diet plan but I did not eat pizza, burgers, or any other junk food. I ate more fruits and restricted my fluid intake to plain water. After 2 months, I lost about 17 lbs. It was a great difference because I am a short person and extra pounds don't look good. I noticed a great difference in legs and my arms. I did not get the super abs but after having two children, I am more than comfortable looking a lot better than before. I think that Jillian Michaels' technique of the 3-2-1: 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of ab work has been the best technique so far. I also bought Ripped in 30 and it has the 3-2-1 technique but this has four levels instead of 3. I borrowed the P90X but I became bored since this is almost an hour workout. I attempted T25 but didn't feel very comfortable because my legs never got a rest and I felt like the rest of my body was not doing much. I love Jillian Michaels and I am looking forward in buying her new workout Bodyshred!!!",1436140800,2,1435,4.056338028169014
3316586,4,B00127RAJY,I have wasted about 30 minutes attempting to find an email or contact with amazon to complain about the quality and inability to play this video. Nad enough that the original contained all three levels and amazon has you pay for each one separately but every time I have tried to play the workout I get adobe update messages. I would rather not have to use this format to complain about this because it is an amazon issue not a work out issue. I have used this dvd in the past to get in shape. It is truly fabulous if you stick with it!! Don't give up however I would recommend buying a hard copy and not waste time adding it to your library for convenience like I did. So far it has been anything but a convenience and if anyone knows how I can actually find a useful place to complain to amazon please let me know because it is frustrating to try to play something you paid for and not be able to use it. Amazon get your act together and fix the way this video plays or in my case doesn't play at all. PS all my other amazon videos play fine and don't constantly prompt me for updated adobe which my computer is in compliance with. Ugh!!,1436054400,2,1139,4.158371040723982
3316587,5,B00127RAJY,Absolutely my favorite exercise video that gives me the best results. I recommend this to everyone looking to lose weight & tone their muscles.,1436054400,2,143,5.0

3316604,5,B00127RAJY,Jillian Michael is the bomb!! Started doing this first thing in the mornings.  Makes the whole day! Never knew you could get so much from a short workout.  The workouts are over 20 minutes but that is because it includes the warm-up and cooling-off.  Best exercise video I have!,1435622400,,278,4.63265306122449
3316605,5,B00127RAJY,"The 30 day shred is a 27 minutes workout from warm up to cool down. Jillian Michaels takes you through three circuits that are six minutes each-- three minutes stregnth, two minutes cardio, and 1 minute abs. There are two modifications for each workout, but you don't have to do either. I personally have only used the first circuit because I just started using the item, but I look forward to the other circuits on this disc!",1435622400,3,426,4.545454545454546

3316609,5,B00127RAJY,Did this to lose baby weight after my first daughter.  Great progression and it was short enough to easily do at home while she was on her play mat or napping.,1435363200,3,159,4.129032258064516
3316610,5,B00127RAJY,Love these workouts!  I workout all the time at the gym and these 20 minute workouts still kicked my butt!  They have you sweating and getting in great cardio!  I have a bad knee that needs surgery so I had to modify some of the jumping parts but I still got a great workout in.  Perfect for busy people wanting a hard workout in a short amount of time!  It's sooooo worth the money to get these and burn some fat!!!,1435363200,3,416,4.08641975308642
3316611,4,B00127RAJY,"It's a great workout.  The only downside is that when you start the video up again, it goes through the whole start up portion of the DVD.  Maybe its a technical thing on my end....I would highly recommend it though.  I'm a beginner and it's an encouragement to work out.",1435363200,,271,4.38

3316627,5,B00127RAJY,My first Jillian DVD and I love it. I love being able to do these workouts in a short time. They may be short but they are challenging and I feel very accomplished. I usually follow it up with my own set of strength/weight training but I love using this as a precursor so I can get my cardio in- my heart blasts the entire workout and I love it. I enjoy Jillian as an instructor and I don't mind that she stops exercising to explain the form. She does that in a few others I have of hers too but I don't mind it. Love.,1434931200,,518,3.8962264150943398

3316629,4,B00127RAJY,Great product so far.  I am still trying all the programs.  I like all the work outs so far and I like how she designed the program.  She does do a lot of jumping jacks so if you have bad knees you may want to use your go to cardio moves during the jumping jack portions.,1434758400,,271,3.8035714285714284

3316631,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great overall workout video. I bought 2, one for home, and one for office use. I've followed it for a month, and finished level 2. Now I rotated between level 1 and 2 depending on my condition and other workout programs. When I first tried level one, I could not complete any single one movement in length and had to take break in the middle. Now the only movements I still have issue with are push-up (in level one) and double jumps in level two. Even so, I still panted and sweated heavily even doing level one. It is an amazing workout DVD, it builds up my strength and endurance but still keeps me challenged.
The only weak point to me is the abs. I don't feel I get my abs worked out enough. Compared with strength and cardio, abs part seems like a welcoming cool-down. I see my upper body and lower body get toned (esp upper arms, chest, backs, shoulders and thighs), but my middle section does not get much improvement. I tried the 'Six Pack in Six weeks', and even that is a good overall workout, it still does not touch my core sufficiently. So I returned to some of the old fashioned crunch-based abs workout DVD. I'll need to wait and see, but I feel sore around abs after these workouts, which I seldom felt with Jillian's workout.",1434585600,2,1253,4.336170212765958

3316645,5,B00127RAJY,"What I love about this workout, is that, although it is not the most enjoyable and fun, it is old school and to the point...It really works! What usually takes hours in the gym to accomplish, Jillian Michaels has achieved in 20-30 minutes. It has different workout levels that you can graduate to as you go along. However, you can meet your weight loss goals if you never advance past Level 1. It will cause you to sweat, and work hard, but it will get easier as you go. And once you see the results, you will be hooked. If you like workouts that are short, effective, and yield quick results, this is the workout for you. Just be ready to tap into your high school athletic days...lol (you'll understand when once you get it).",1434326400,4,727,4.392592592592592

3316650,4,B00127RAJY,"This program really works! I Waited 2 weeks to review it because I wanted to give myself time to see results. I consider myself a highly active person, and I still had to work at this. 20 minutes a day will give you results if you give it a good effort. You will need a set of weights and a mat if you plan on working on a hard surface. Two weeks in, I'm down 5 lbs and can see more definition in my arms and abs!",1434153600,6,413,3.7586206896551726

All are cirut training, 3 mins is strength moving big and little muscles small weights, followed by 2 mins of cardio ending with 1 min and. But she mixes it up so you are doing several different excersices. I would get more out of it if I did it more than 3X a week but I have a bum knee, so I slightly modified some and do it on days my knee feels good.  I recommend this.",1434067200,4,425,3.8850574712643677

3316664,5,B00127RAJY,This workout is absolutely amazing. I have to admit that I only got to level 2. But I use it as a way to stay fit. It is way better (for me) than jogging or one hr work out. The program works your entire body and even I was doing it for a while it is very intense.,1433980800,,264,3.5689655172413794

3316668,5,B00127RAJY,"I've been going back to this video for yrs. The first time I tried it about 3 yrs ago I was completely out of shape, the resulting soreness was uncomfortable at first (normal) but I stuck to it & got toned so quickly like I've never have before in my life-not even at the gym. If you do it at least 4-5 times a week you will see results in less than a month. This is not an easy workout, but it is so convenient due to the fact that you can do it from home, you need minimal equipment (mat for hard floors & weights-I use 5 lbs.) and the workout itself is short and goes by quickly.

I always start with this after long periods of not working out. After 2 yrs of not working out & unwanted weight gain,  I popped in my Jillian DVD & after only 2 weeks I see my abs again. I feel so much stronger and also have more endurance. I move on to the next level after 2 weeks which is when my muscles start to feel conditioned.

I highly recommend this dvd. I've gifted it as well. It's tough but anyone can do it if they stick to it and you'll feel really amazing when you see the quick results. You may feel as if you can't get through it at first which is normal but you can if you push.

I highly recommend Jillian Michael's  ""No More Trouble Zones"" after completing ""30 Day Shred "". The workout is longer but it'll make you even stronger.",1433808000,8,1335,4.003759398496241
3316669,5,B00127RAJY,"I love this workout. Level 1 is great, level 2 is waaaayyyyyy too hard...there is a lot of up and downs...so if you have knee issues, stick with level 1...there seems to be a big leap from level 1 to 2. I always feel sore, and my body actually feels like it is changing. Also you can do level 1 as a warm up and then go running after if you really want a great work out.

I also start off with this dvd if I haven't worked out in a while. It gets me back in the groove of things.

I now have the whole dvd memorized so I turn down the volume and turn up my music. haha. It's the best. Thanks Jillian!

I've read some of the other reviews where people mentioned that this workout isn't good because it is rough on the knees. If you have bad knees, like myself, you can modify these moves or switch them out for a movement with less impact on the knees. Really, it's about following her system of cardio, strength and abs. Another bonus -  you only have to suffer 20 minutes. I'm on level two and have only been at it a few weeks and have noticed my muscles toning up and I'm losing some of my baby fat after four kids. Well worth it.",1432944000,18,685,4.229007633587786

But i will advice ppl to just do it 3-4 times per week if you are a  beginner and if you are athletic 5 times a week is enough the body needs rest.,1432944000,4,411,3.7241379310344827

She's one tough trainer, she often says things that aren't nice in this video but it's to motivate and push you to work through and make the most of the 20 mins she has you working out. I have done the 30 days but not 7 days a week since I do  long run and rest for one day on weekend. However I have seen the difference in my clothes and my stamina doing the workouts. I still can't do the unmodified versions of all three levels but I am in better shape than I was before I started and it takes minimal time for my day. I also went from not working out at all to being able to keep up with most of the excercises. I think the key is that it's short but it's a lot of work so most people should be able to do this video with no problems.",1432684800,,843,3.8728323699421967

3316728,4,B00127RAJY,"I bought Jillian Micheals 30 day shred about 2 years ago. Tried it a few times, it was really hard and I didn't stick to it more than a day or two. I am 5'7"" and weigh 167lbs. This is the most I've ever weighed and decided I really needed to do something about it; becuase I have never been so uncomfortable with my body. Over the past 8ish months I've gained 20lbs. Id love to be back down into the 140 range but am trying not to get my hopes too high and would be happy with losing 10lbs.
I am currently on day 4 of the 30 day shred still on level 1. And as hard as this DVD is I love it. After the first day of working out my calves and arms were killing me, but it's a good kind of pain! The only reason I didn't give this DVD a 5 star rating is because I'm just not sure yet if I am going to loose any weight. This time however, I am going to put in my all to stick to it. so for so good. I have changed my diet a little and am doing this workout everyday hoping to see results! I will be coming back in 25 days to share what has happened!",1432512000,,1044,3.7072072072072073

3316743,5,B00127RAJY,"How can I love this DVD? It's PAINFUL, it's not easy by any means and yet I love it. I've waited 2 months to write this review because I really wanted to give it a fair shot before I jumped in with my thoughts. I tend to go gung-ho at first, dive right in and then quit too quickly because I pushed myself too hard. This time I was really careful and methodical with how I went about this DVD. I'm 42, have a son and felt determined to finally begin my goal of exercising regularly. I'm 5ft 5. I started at 162 Ibs. My size 10's were getting too tight and I refused to go up to a 12!

Level 1 starts off with an easy enough warm up and ends with basic stretching.
It includes 3 circuits, each circuit consisting of:
1) 3 minutes of strength (pushups, lunges, side lunges, chest flies, etc.)
2) 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope [without the rope], punches)
3) 1 minute abs (basic crunch, reverse crunch, side crunches, bicycle)

I use 5Ib weights throughout except I use 3Ib for the boxing/cardio and shoulder raise/side lunge (which happens to be my favorite of all of the exercises)

After 2 months I've lost 7 Ibs and instead of squeezing into a tight size 10 I'm now in a size 6 in some clothes, but mostly a size 8. I'm VERY happy with this. I didn't measure myself because I honestly didn't think I'd keep it up truth be told, but I've definitely lost inches. More than how I look though is how great I feel. I have more energy. My stamina is amazing, and I just love this DVD! I love how I feel when I'm done.

One other thing about me - I have MS. I have a mild case of it - knock wood - but because of weakness in my legs I've had to modify how often I do this workout. I tried it daily for 6 days straight but I couldn't maintain that pace as my symptoms returned. My dr. said I was pushing my body too hard so I now I do it every other day and cardio on the other days. I also follow a low calorie diet and Jillian Michael's 80/20 philosophy. I believe all of this has helped me go down 2 sizes. I don't want to be a size 2. I'll never be a skinny lithe person. But getting to a six and feeling so much healthier is something I'm really proud of. Here's what has helped me:

1) It's only 22 minutes, and as hard as it is it goes by very fast. This has helped me realize and appreciate I can find 20 minutes in my day to this. There's no excuse. My son does his homework, and I work out. I get up early some days to do it. I do it on weekends. There's NO excuse not to do it with it being so short.

2) Take your time and don't push yourself too hard. The day after I first did it I could hardly move. It hurt to sit down to pee for crying out loud! I took 2 days off and went back at it. Start slow and ease into it. This is a tough workout .... don't burn out so fast by rushing in.

3) Practice the form of each movement and then get into it. My knees killed me the first 2 weeks and a lot of reviews mention knee pain because of this workout. It's not this DVD that's the problem - it's the way you're doing it! Practice, do it with someone watching you and get your form right. And then when you're exercising watch your form to make sure you're not injuring yourself. After I did this my knee pain went away and I'm all good.

4) Go at your pace. In the beginning I would try and keep up with Jillian and it was completely stressing me out. Go at your pace. You'll find after a week or two your stamina will have improved and you can push yourself harder.

5) Adjust the routine if you feel you need to. I realized I will never be able to do a pushup on my toes. I just can't do it. So now I do the plank the whole time she does the pushups. It's HARD! But I can do that better than a pushup.

6) I am still on level 1 after 2 months. Probably because I do it every other day. I don't feel stressed about that. I'm not ready to move on yet. I've seen (amazing) results with level 1 and I'm ok with that. Having MS doesn't stop me from doing this but it does make me tweak it in a way that is beneficial for me.

7) Believe it or not when I miss my workout days - life gets busy as a mom and birthday parties, and school meeting and my job can take over but I always get back to it. The longest break I've taken is 5 days and every single day I tried to get to it but something pulled me away. I never fully quit though and would get right back to it. It also taught me that it's harder when you've not done it for a while!!!! That in itself makes me want to keep going and never miss a day. I now do it more first thing in the AM even though that kills me as I'm not a morning person.

8) I HATE the warm up and the first 10 minutes. I literally loathe it. That's the hardest for me for some reason. But once it gets going and I'm 10 minutes in, I LOVE it. I have certain points in the dvd where she says things that just make me smile. When she talks about wanting to quit and turn the dvd off, I'm always going harder, pushing myself further. When she says don't phone it in , go lower and deeper with your legs, I do. I love her and feel she is funny, and real and she makes me want to be better.

9) If you can do more, do it. In level 1 during the boxing/cardio I use 3Ib pound weights. I don't have to but I can, so I push it harder.

10) Watch your diet. I've seen the best changes when I really commit to the 80/20 philosophy. No point kicking your but in this workout only to spoil it with poor food choices.

Give this DVD a try. Commit to it. REALLY COMMIT to it and you'll see results.",1432166400,81,5537,3.896276595744681

The most amazing result is my blood pressure.  I am 33yo and my BP wasn't considered high but it had been consistently at the higher end of normal for the last couple of years, enough to cause concern. At days 5 & 6 I had my BP taken, just normal doc visits, and my both times my BP was just below 120/80 (in a good way) & I was complimented on my healthy BP. I was floored!!! Considering it was also finals week & the fact that my BP normally increases anyways due to anxiety about the reading it is even more amazing.

The exercises are tough but doable. Even at the modified version I'm still getting my butt kicked. Be aware that level 2 has a lot of plank poses, which some may find difficult.  It's alot of up and down etc...

Overall for a program that costs $8 & only lasts 20 min it is fantastic. I am hooked to j michaels & just ordered her Ripped in 30. Can't wait to start!",1431129600,4,1123,3.9955357142857144

TAKE your TIME. In the beginning I could only do 2 push-ups...and laid there as they kept going....eventually, a few times after doing it I could keep up.
I really felt like I hit a big goal after completing the level 1 with ease. It really boosted my confidence.
It will not be a 30 day shred for me, it will be more like a 60 day.

I do exercise 3-4 times a week, so it is an impressive result. People at work started to comment my weight lose, even if i just lost 2 kgs. I am short and athletic so those 2 kgs gave a fantastic effect on the whole body shape. Those exercises are pretty simple, effective and work the whole body. I didn't do that workout every day but it still works. For those, who doesn't like Jillian, she can be pretty annoying at the video, but the video gives results.

The first time I did, I was 50 pounds overweight and so out of shape that I could not complete the warm up! 9 months later,  I tried it again after losing 30 pounds- and successfully completed it. This workout is great! I lost so many inches and went down from a size 10 to size 6 in exactly 30 days!  I did some extra cardio most of the days- usually 20-30 minutes of walking.  This is a great workout and results are guaranteed.",1429660800,4,462,4.168539325842697

3316881,5,B00127RAJY,"Everyone always seems to talk and have such great reviews with this DVD so I gave it a shot! At first, I really wasn't a fan of Jillian but now I have most of her DVDs so I think I've become a fan. Her workouts always make me sweat and feeling overall accomplished.

For this one, you have three levels, starting with level one and you progress forward when you're sure you can step up to the next level. It only takes a month to do so you really have to focus.  Don't be afraid to step it up if feel you may not be ready for the next level. You have to get used to that *next level* work to put in and then, it'll become easy to you! When I thought I had the first day in the bag, WRONG! It was super hard for me! Since I'm used to doing some of these moves over and over again, it seems it'll be easy easy. However, you learn and do the exercises over and over each day. You begin to build strength to sustain for longer periods plus my endurance has gotten better too. I've noticed in other workouts outside of this DVD, I've become quicker. Also I've managed to make it without so many pauses too. I got through level two and three by the end of the 30 days and still to this day, all three levels are a challenge I'm always up for! Jillian really kicks you to push yourself along with Anita and Natalie throughout every session which is great motivation!

I didn't lose AS much weight with this because those last extra lbs want to be stubborn. However, I lost a couple of inches off my waist, thighs and have gained strength all around so I'm glad to be leaner and feeling the burn afterwards! It's an excellent DVD for those who want to see what they're capable of. Overall, pleased with the results that came of it and planning on doing this one all over again.",1429142400,9,1769,4.136627906976744

3316897,4,B00127RAJY,"Good Video. I liked everyone's recommendation of switching the levels up instead of doing 10 days of level one in a row. Do more stretching on your calf's after the workout. The amount of stretching is very short, and you only hold the post for 10 sec. My only frustration is the 5 minutes of introduction on the DVD that you cannot fast forward through before you get the option to select what workout you want to do. I find myself having to start it, walk away and do something else while I wait for all the credits/intro to finish. Overall, good video...

3316919,4,B00127RAJY,"There are three quick workouts that get progressively harder.  They are fast paced and about 20 minutes plus warm up/cool down.  You can make them harder by using heavier weights.  20 minutes isn't a lot of time to work out.  I think using this can result in weight loss if you are really dieting.  I do know it can improve you overall level of fitness.  I do like that most moves aren't risky, just designed to work your muscles.  Overall it is a good, quick workout.  I don't thin anyone will blast off a ton of weight if they aren't dieting and moving more throughout the day.  I started ramping up my workouts with this and have now progressed the Cathe's workouts that can be 40 minutes to an hour plus.  Cathe is much harder, but very enjoyable.",1428624000,2,751,4.3768115942028984

3316937,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels really pushes you in this video.  It is not easy, even on the easy level, but it is doable.  Take it a bit at a time and work through what you can.

I have done that and keep on increasing as I start working out again.  It may be something that is a bit difficult but worthwhile.  Even doing a few minutes has helped as I have gone along with the combination of things she targets.

Again, not easy, perhaps not beginner, but with taking it a bit at a time it works.",1428105600,,483,4.031578947368421

3316941,5,B00127RAJY,"Let me first start off by telling a little bit about myself. I am 25 years old and overweight. In high school I played tennis and did marching band, so I was decently active. Back then, I was not super skinny, in fact, I have never been super skinny, but I wasn't fat like I am now (maybe a little harsh? it's the truth...). Once I went to college, I was doing no form of exercise except walking to and from class and taking the stairs occasionally. I probably did gain the freshman 15 because of the delicious cafeteria food. Still tho, I wasn't as self conscious as I am today. What really got me was when I graduated college and got an internship at a hotel and served every morning. I ate everything in sight, but I was also hustling my ass off with waiting on tables and working weddings. You don't sit while serving, I should have been losing weight, but wasn't because of the over eating. So, that's how I got to where I am now: very overweight.

I decided that since I would like to become a mother within the next few years, I would like to lose weight before I get pregnant. After reading the reviews, I decided to get this. Can't beat 20 minutes when you're lazy like me!

Day one: HARD. I had to stop a few times, even with Jillian telling me not to, but it's hard. I could barely do the push-ups (which was discouraging because being in marching band, we did push ups all the time). I got through it tho, and felt great afterwords.

Day two: Hard, but seemed easier. I was so sore tho. I could hardly walk down one step. I was walking around work looking ridiculous. I was just so sore.

Took one day of rest because that was my plan, but also because I slipped on some ice on day two and fell right on my knee.

Day three: I could definitely see a difference from day one, I WAS getting stronger and I could make it through the last set of cardio where you do everything without stopping!

Blah blah blah, it got easier and I am getting stronger. I have been slacking on the jumping jacks because I hate them more than anything, but I can see a difference every day, even when I skip days. Usually work out on Monday, Tuesday, skip Wednesday, start again on Thursday, work out Friday, and Saturday if I'm feeling it. Rest again on Sunday. However, my knees are killing me, not sure if it's the squats or the lunges, but they hurt. Also, some days I get shin splints, but they go away within a few hours. I guess that's to be expected because those are common with an increase in activity level. I have not moved on from level one because I still can't do it all the way through, but when I feel like I'm ready, I will move on. For the price, you really can't beat it.",1428019200,8,2681,4.206225680933852

3316957,5,B00127RAJY,"I was totally out of shape when I started this workout DVD, so I really appreciated that Jillian has two women doing the workout - one who uses some accommodations to make it easier, one doing it 100% to give something to aim for.  I also have a bum knee - a result of a sports injury back in my early teens, although I kept playing sports for a few more decades.  For the first month, I used a knee brace to help with the stability.  Now I have built up the muscles around my knee enough that I don't need the brace.

I haven't lost the degree of weight that they talk about, but I still give it 5 stars.  My body shape is changing, and I'm a lot healthier.  Three months ago, I had huge, flabby upper arms.  Now they aren't an embarrassment, and I can feel the muscles growing and getting definition while the fat is lessening.  My stomach area is tighter and my pants fit better.  Even when I was young, I did ""girl"" push-ups, on my knees instead on the balls of my feet - now I can do real push-ups.  I can jog again, although not for as long as I'd like (but I know I'll get better, now!)  So, even though the weight is not disappearing at the rate I'd like, I'm really happy with the results so far.  I just feel so much better!  Oh - I'm doing the video 4 days a week.

I love that the workouts are 20 minutes.  I mean, who can't find a mere 20 minutes in their day?  I'm getting another of her DVDs with a longer, harder workout now, but it's good to know that on days when there's a ton of stuff going on, I can just do a 20 minute workout.  I like the 3-2-1 structure of the workout, too.  (3 minutes of strength, 2 of cardio, 1 of abs)  Most importantly, I love her teaching approach and personality.  With Anita demonstrating the easier version of an exercise, and Natalie demonstrating the no short-cuts version, it's easy to to build up to doing the harder exercises.  Jillian makes sure to point out the proper technique, and she seems to say the right motivational statement at the right time for me.",1427760000,11,2016,4.1576227390180875

I really wanted to tone up and drop about 10 pounds within two months but I didn't want to spend huge sums of time or money so I decided to try this DVD.  I have been doing this DVD for exactly one month as of today, but I tweaked the plan by alternating between the DVD and running 2-3 miles every other day (I reduced my portions as well but didn't follow any particular diet plan).  In one month of doing this I have lost 6 pounds, 1 inch in my waist, bust and hips, and a full pant-size.  I have a defined waist and visible abs for the first time that I can recall (I have weighed less, but not had such a defined waist).  For me, this did what I hoped it would do. I feel that if I had done this every day as it was intended the results would probably be slightly better, but I knew I would get burned out if I didn't switch things up.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and I always alternated between the three different Levels to make it more interesting.  As for Jillian Michaels, I am not her biggest fan but her DVD was cheap and delivered decent results for me so I can deal with it.

3317023,5,B00127RAJY,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks and it is perfect! Not too grueling but enough to work up a good sweat. I could never stick to a workout routine at my gym because the classes were too long and I would always dread going. This workout is short enough, yet EFFECTIVE, so I don't allow myself to make excuses to not get it done. One thing to be mindful of is form. Considering the workout is only 20min, you really need to have really good form to get the most out of the workout. I notice that my form was off during the ab portions but as soon as a corrected it I noticed  more intensity and tightening of my my ab muscles during the workout. Doing the same routine everyday can be boring for some people, but I don't mind because the routine is short enough that I don't feel the need to be overly entertained. These workouts have been the best thing to happen to me. No more flaking out and taking month long hiatus from working out due to the fact that I would dread hour long workouts that were killing me.",1426032000,3,1020,4.151515151515151
3317024,5,B00127RAJY,"I am 39 with two young kids - one still in preschool. I have very little time to myself and I am tired all the time. My body has not bounced back after the birth of my second child and I can't seem to lose weight no matter what I do. I tried going to the gym 3-4 times a week for 3 months doing mostly cardio and I didn't lose a pound. I am permanently 15 pounds overweight and at 5 ""2 it really shows. It is VERY hard to kickstart another exercise regime under these circumstances. Exercising daily is like torture when you are extremely out of shape like yours truly.

It felt like a 20 min DVD was a realistic start but I wasn't very hopeful it would work. 5 weeks later (and I'm not even doing it daily) I am noticing my jeans are fitting looser. I can see some muscle definition (under the fat) and my endurance has already improved. I am being very careful with my diet, with the occasional (ok frequent) slip. But wow, I am actually finding the exercises easier and feel motivated to get up early to do it. I accepted that sometimes my preschooler would be next to me joining in or that I would feel like a zombie at 6am. It's not pretty or fun but I feel better finally. I am going to try to do it daily or at least 5 days per week. I haven't dared weigh myself. I will let my body improve more first. It's important not to dwell on weight.

I have great affection for Jillian Michaels. I feel like she really cares about helping people like me. Just when I want to stop and lay on the couch she says, ""you can't get results in 20 mins without working for it"" and I keep going. Or she says, ""this is no joke. You gotta work hard for this"". I appreciate her motivation and her recognition that it is hard work. I love her no-nonsense style. The girls are athletic and dress in casual exercise clothes. Yeah the music is cheesy and horrible but it is super expensive for these companies to buy the rights to ""real"" music so they make their own. I have yet to find a workout DVD with good music. I don't really care. It's the exercise that matters.

My only critique is that the ab work could easily be 2 minutes or even 3 minutes instead of just 1. It is certainly not enough to get any results. When I can I supplement with another ab workout I have - or just do more ab exercises without a DVD. I never feel sore in the abs after this DVD. Otherwise though it is a fantastic all round workout. Who knew I would me willing to do jumping jacks??

I love Jillian!!!",1426032000,7,2470,4.107660455486543

I am not a youngster and I was finding myself grabbing hold of counters or chairs to get up from a kneeling position; a sure sign of age and I was not a fan.
The first time I did the Shred I couldn't walk easily for a day or two and started worrying that I had injured myself BUT I stretched as directed in the program and did it again two days later and have never looked back. I can now easily stand from a seated position or even a crouch and my push-ups are improving every day.

3317090,3,B00127RAJY,"Honestly, I purchased this from walmart. I had a cesarean almost 1 year ago. I gained 25 lbs during pregnancy.  I had a 9 lb 5 oz baby. I was still only 10 lbs lighter than the day I had him so I decided I no longer had the excuse ""I just had a baby"" it had been almost a year... that excuse sailed months ago. I looked up my bmi and saw I was considered borderline ""obese"". That was it. I had to change.
So January 23... step 1... started drinking only water and lots of it. Height 5'2"" Weight 161.2...
Jan 27th- cut out large quantities of carbs. No more bread, pasta or potatoes. (Prep for atkins) weight 157
Feb 1st- began atkins.
also began couch 2 5 K program. Weight 156

Today... feb 24th... decided I need to add something extra to my workout routine. I've had this dvd since after having my son. Time to put it to use right?!?!
So current weight... 151. Goal... 125. I'll keep you posted thru my journey and if this program helps  I will increase the stars.

1st update. March 9th.... I sprained my ankle then got the stomach flu so have not yet started. Starting today.
Weight 147.
Height 5'2.

Update 2- tendinitis in my knees started bothering me. Took a break. Stopped atkins and gained 10 lbs back. I was down to 144 now back at 154. Haven't been doing the dvd like I should. Starting again today. Hard to stay motivated once u gain weight back... :-( I'm going to try. I've not yet stuck with the dvd for 30 days.",1424736000,4,1429,4.200729927007299

Though I didn't get ""shredded"", the results are awesome and happened faster than with yoga, pilates, running, walking, cardio/strength at the gym, swimming and HIIT.

Note: it may not be a great program for you if you have problems with your knees and ankles. If you have manageable issues, just spend a few extra minutes doing dynamic stretches on your troublespots before you get into it, and focus on form throughout, even if you have to go a bit slower.",1424476800,5,841,4.532894736842105

Her workouts keep me interested and motivated. Just when I start to think I want to cheat she reminds me it's a short workout and you gotta work to get results. Next thing I know its cool down time.

3317209,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian really does it this time.  This workout is a must have for anyone's workout dvd library.  There are so many positives to it!  First of all, it's only twenty minutes--the work out really does fly by!!  Second of all, it is very challenging!  I have been doing this DVD for a month now and I still feel like I've had my butt handed to me by the end of it.  Jillian is seriously no-nonsense in this DVD and I love it.  She doesn't pull any punches--she tells it like it is.  I only have a few concerns about this DVD.  First of all, I think it's a little much for Jillian to expect a person to be able to do push ups in level one.  I have lost almost sixty pounds in the past five months and I still cannot master the full push up.  Even the one on the knees is too challenging for me.  The difficulty of the exercises seem kind of inconsistent--I can handle almost all of level one at the advanced level except for those darn push ups!  The plank positions are really what get me--and the modification is still even a struggle.  I liked in her Killer Buns and Thighs DVD that I was able to start at a beginning level and really build up the muscle--right now with that darn plank, I just feel like I keep failing!  But I suppose that's something to work for and strive for!  The other concern I have is one that many have offered--Natalie really does ""phone it in"" several times in the work out.  It's kind of annoying!  Jillian is challenging you not to stop and then you see this girl with this amazing body just quitting a few times.  I try to remind myself that they probably work out that whole day, but it doesn't always help me from getting mad at her!

I started doing this workout when I was 240 pounds (I'm 5'6"" and female).  It was seriously hard, but I managed even with five pound weights!  Now that I've shaved off sixty pounds, I still do the work out and I still find it effective.  I've been doing this DVD with her Killer Buns and Thighs One for a month and I see incredible improvements in my cardio, my waist and my arms.  Jillian is the way to go--and the complaints I have are so small, they almost should even be a concern at all.  Go Jillian, I absolutely love you!!!",1422662400,8,2197,4.186157517899761

Day one i was taking my inhaler every 5 minutes throughout the workout, and it was very hard. But today i took my inhaler before i started and got through it with no issues. I will add that ive been doing this along with substituting two meals a day with slimfast shakes, and one 500 calorie meal a day, and eating 3 100 calorie snacks a day. Drinking only water other than the shakes. But thats my choice. Basically with a great diet u will most likely see amazing results.",1422576000,7,686,4.165413533834586

3317240,5,B00127RAJY,"I read the other reviews before buying this DVD of Jillian's 30 Day Shred.  I bought it anyway because you can't always go by reviews and I'm glad I did.

First off, I will say, If you have not ever worked out before or had a regular exercise regime of any type, I would suggest you do as I am doing and instead of planning to lose the weight in 1 month and do all 3 levels in 1 month, split it up and plan 1 level a month for 3 months.

Before buying this video, I had been doing minimal exercise so know my body needs conditioned first.  While I do want to lose weight, I realize that I can't just expect my body to be able to jump right in there after it has not had any type of conditioning to exercise, so decided to take it slow.  Instead of doing this every day, I try to do it 3 to 5 times a week and take a day off as needed (if my muscles hurt too much I take a day off or if I simply don't have time, it is ok to take the day off).

I decided to try to complete 1 level to the point that I could start out with the easy, modified way (the girl on the right) until I could build my body up to follow the harder, full range way (the girl on the left).  Once my body is conditioned to do the workout to the maximum on level 1, then and only then will I move to level 2.  I plan this to take me 3 months instead of 1 month to complete and then after that, i can focus on doing each level every day of the week and completing all 3 in 1 months time (month 4).

Losing weight is important, but conditioning is the first thing one has to do and that is important to know your limitations as well.

As for the reviews about this being bad for the knees....if is not bad for your knees if you are listening to Jillian and doing as she says and she makes it very clear what posture you should not have in order to not damage your knees.  I have a very weak knee from an injury, and I am finding that doing this workout at a slower modified pace and stretching level 1 out to 1 month instead of 1 week, and following everything Jillian says about how to position the knees so as not to hurt them, my weak knee is actually being strengthened.

I have been doing this workout for 2 weeks now and I am noticing a huge difference in my endurance and strength as well as my overall physical well-being.  I am also sleeping better, eating healthier, and living happier.  I may not be losing the 20 lbs in 1 month that one would lose if they did this every day and did 1 full level at the hardest directions every week, but that will come in time.

Something people tend to forget is that when you do a video like this, it is ok to modify where needed for yourself until you build up your body endurance and strength to do the workout with Jillian and the girls.  You don't have to be just like them.  Do it at your own pace, modifying where you need to, not modifying where you don't need to and in time, you will be able to keep up with them and go the whole way through with no problem.

We live in a day and age where everyone wants everything right now.  Workouts are not something you want to have that attitude with if you want them to be successful for you.

Great video with lots of workout 'suggestions' and help.  I also got the Ripped in 30 days to do after I complete this video, but I believe doing both will take me probably 9 months to a year to get up to par and be able to keep up with them all.  And for me, while I do need to lose some weight, I will along the way and so it is all ok to take my time.

Thanks, Jillian, for making an affordable workout video that gets me up and moving and started toward a healthier lifestyle.",1422057600,23,3640,3.9224489795918367

So I tried it. I think the workout is really not too bad and boy do I sweat when I do it! But it bugs me to do a workout video where your trainer doesn't do at least half of the work. I guess for me I like to know that your trainer really is ""right there with you"". I also didn't like the fact that some of the moves you do for much longer then for the other side of your body. Overall, this is a good workout though a little rough on legs and knees if the moves are not performed correctly.

The program has 3 different levels of routines. They recommend following each for 10 days. They do not mention taking rest days. I took about two per 10-day cycle, so it took about 36 days total.

For people at the very beginning of their fitness journey, there is a model to follow who is doing modified routines. There is no problem following the modifications, and it's especially nice to see your progress as you can move from the modified version to the regular version.

After the program I moved on to mostly running for exercise, but I still will go back to this and do a workout when I need something quick and indoors.",1420675200,2,787,4.458333333333333

Sorry. The wisest thing anyone has ever told me is ""Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym"" And it's true. Doing a calorie restriction AND this workout video will give you dramatic results!

========

Some pointers; use LIGHT weights. I tried to use 5 pounds weights in the first interval for arms and i literally could no longer feel them. Don't feel like a 'wimp' for using 1-2 pounder weights! Trust me, i will be buying lighter weights!

Now this workout kicked my butt. I was already breaking a sweat within the first interval. It's no joke, there is NO rest time. You're moving the entire time. And i found this workout isn't actually 20 minutes-- it's more along the lines of 30minutes.",1420329600,12,877,4.428571428571429

3317335,5,B00127RAJY,"After a long time of inactivity, Ive decided it was time to restart working out. 30-day shred level one is perfect just for that. If you haven't worked out in a while, this work out has a good balance. It is a bit physically challenging, if you are unfit, but not so much so that you cant do it. So it makes you sweat, but not in a way that makes you despair, give up, and quit. Then, after youve done it for a while, if you are a beginner or a re-beginner its probably better to stay at level one for more than a week, you can move up to the other levels that increase the challenge.
The workout is short, so it doesnt take up too much of your time, and it doesnt give you any excuse not to do it. The form is the usual for Jillian, 3 min strength, 2 min cardio, 1 min abs so you work all the essential. She keeps every part of your body engaged, so that you can take out the max effect from your 20min effort.
Jillian, as always, is tough and motivating, she irradiates you with energy from the TVs screen. Shes a BOMB of energy and purpose that will make you love what you do, even when you hate it!!",1419552000,4,1103,3.972972972972973

3317355,5,B00127RAJY,"Like any other workout regime, it requires determination and a good diet for results. Do not expect to see any results if you don't follow the workout or do not eat well.  I have been following this regimen for years, not just for 30 days and I love the 20-minute workouts. Like some reviewers have said, her constant chattering can get pretty annoying but if you're really serious about getting a workout, you would concentrate on the actual exercise and not the instructor's annoying comments.

They are truly challenging, but if you are diligent, your endurance will improve over time. In my opinion, to lose the 20 in 30, you would have to have a high level of endurance to start. When I began this regimen, I could not complete a full workout. My advise is to stay motivated.

It's fun and very quick. I've seen my stamina increase and my body looks more toned. I'm an average woman with no athletic ability.

3317481,5,B00127RAJY,"I really like Jillian from the Biggest Loser; therefore, I wanted to try the 30 Day Shred, and I was not disappointed. This workout DVD has three different levels that increase with difficulty from level 1 to level 2. The workouts were about 25 minutes long from warm up to cool down. Each workout is a combination of strength, cardio, and abs.  And, because workouts are intense and short, they are done before you know it. Also, I really like the fact that Jillian has two models that work out with her and one model is for beginners and the other is for more advanced workouts. This was awesome because it eased me into working out on a more consistent basis.
I did take before and after pics of working out over 30 days and I did see a difference in my body regarding my stomach and muscles being more toned.
I really like this DVD and would suggest it. And, I used it after I had my twins and it helped me get back into the swing of things for working out after babies.",1415318400,7,974,4.264864864864865

3317486,3,B00127RAJY,"These workouts are effective for a minimal time commitment, as long as you give it your all. I get bored to death doing the same thing over and over again so when I do the 30DS, I do a MWF circuit going up a level each day.

The 3 stars are purely for how effective these workouts can be. I still haven't decided how much I like working out with Jillian. She says things like ""It's hard for us too"" while standing there, not doing her own workout. Or she'll claim that if you do the workout on Natalie's level, you will actually look like Natalie ""in no time."" Yeah right. The low point is when she tells us to think of bathing suit shopping. C'mon, bathing suit shopping? What is this, a Cathy comic?

I also find the cool-down to be very insufficient. If you are going to do 30DS with regularity, please consider adding in a separate stretching routine. This workout will stiffen you up ""in no time."" And last- be very careful with the lunges and squats. They move quick and if you're not used to compound movements, you can easily lose track of your knees while you focus on your arms. This will give you messed up knees ""in no time.""",1414972800,2,1137,4.283720930232558

Well after 2 weeks of doing this workout, I noticed my knees would hurt sooo bad whenever I would bend down and I thought it was something that would go away. So I continued the workout for another 2 weeks. One afternoon I bent my neck down and heard a crack and picked my head up and this INTENSE paralyzing pain shot down my spine and my shoulders, I was in agonizing pain!!! I thought maybe it's the workout? Well a few days later it got better and I continued the workout for about another 3 weeks (not doing it everyday) than one morning that same pain happened again!! So I immediately went to the chiropractor and got adjusted and stopped the video! It's been 4 weeks since I've stopped and have not experienced pain like that again. Now mind you I snowboarded and did p90x and have NEVER in my life experienced knee pain or neck pain like that. I'm contributing this workout to that pain because Jillian does not emphasize on stretching! Which is sooooo important! I recommend noone buy this!

3317553,5,B00127RAJY,"This review is really my personal diary to keep myself accountable. So far I think the workout is 5 star since I feel like I'm not wasting my time. I actually sweat and feel a bit sore afterward. I really have fallen waaayyyyy off the wagon with exercise. I ran track in middle school, was a cheerleader in high school and stayed pretty active afterward until I had my daughter several years ago. Then more life happened...my dad passed away last year from cancer and I had the supervisor from hell last year who tried to get me fired so exercise fell by the wayside just due to sheer depression over all of that.
  Fast forward to the present. I've decided screw this surviving to see another paycheck with a job I hate. I'm going to at least try to look good while doing it. So I've FINALLY taken up exercise again. I lost about 10 lbs back in the spring just from changing my diet to a more Paleo/Primal style. I've never really been a rice/bread/grain person anyway so it fits me well. I started doing my old standby Walk Away the Pounds during the summer, but kind of slacked with that. So now I've discovered this 30 day shred in the past couple of weeks. I work from home so really started to notice in the past month or so that I've lost a lot of muscle definition just from being home for the past 7 years. It was really disconcerting. So what I really want is to gain my fitness level back. Plus, I don't have the money for a new wardrobe. In addition to that, I don't have the money for cosmetic surgery. I'm one of those who don't have a large chest so a flabby gut just doesn't suit me. I can be flat chested, but damn if I'm going to be flat chested with a huge gut lol!
  Anyhow, I'm going to update this review every so often. I'll include what I did each day and we'll see where I end up afterward. I'm not going ham with this. I've been there done that when I killed my knees doing Slim in 6 when I was in my 20s. I didn't know anything about resting every other day after doing a workout like that. Needless to say, the older I get my knees just can't take the heavy squatting etc. Although I will admit my legs looked absolutely gorgeous after doing Slim in 6. Just shame on Debbie Siebers (sp?) for not giving good advice about how often to do the workout. That's why I like Lindsey Brin so much. Anyway, I digress...so with this workout at my older age (I'm late 30s...okay not ancient, but these knees say otherwise...) I'm planning to do things differently. I still believe I can have the body I want, but I'll just get it at a slower pace. So for any of you with creaky knees or who haven't worked out in ages I'd suggest investing in some Biofreeze and knee braces (heck elbow and wrist braces if needed!) before even attempting this work out. Oh yeah, also one of those nifty ice packs where you put the ice in and screw the top on. So I have my Biofreeze ready, the ice pack and I have my two knee braces. I'm ready! (I also bought Tiger Balm before I got my Biofreeze from Amazon. My daughter kept asking Mommy what is that? It smells delicious! LOL!) The whole point is to be prepared for any muscle soreness and whatnot. *I plan to write updates for every day that it takes me to get to 30 days. So I'm sure this review will be LOOONNNNNGGGGGG!!! Plus, I'll be able to see what the heck I'm doing and what, if any, excuses I come up with not to do the workout. So here's what I've done so far and I'll continue to update when I have time.

Day 1- Shred, Level 1 (feeling pumped like I accomplished something. Hey, maybe I can do this whole thing through with a rest day after every 6 days. Yeah!)

Day 2-Shred, Level 1 (calves are tight as hell! LOL! Uh...about doing this workout for 6 days straight...)

Day 3- Walk Away the Pounds (30 minute workout dvd) (Thinking I better take it easy before I put myself in the hospital. Doing the moves in Walk Away helped soothe my tight, achy muscles. I actually feel better and more stretched after this workout.)

Day 4-Shred, Level 1 (This day is SO much better! I feel stronger. Calves are still sore, but not crazy sore like the first 2 days. I slapped some Tiger Balm on my knees beforehand along with wearing a knee brace on my left knee. It was great! I could get through the workout without a whole lot of pain. I'm still doing the moves at low impact, but I can get through them. Just don't want to overdue ANYTHING. I want to get stronger and stronger before attempting anything crazy. Still broke a sweat and felt satisfied afterward.)

Day 5- no exercise, rest day

Day 6- Shred Level 1 (this day was okay. Much more energy since I took Sat. off)

Day 7-Shred level 1 (meh. A little sore from yesterday. My butt and lower back are sore. I want to get stronger but all things in due time. I'm soooooout of shape! Grrrr! I just keep watching YouTube video results for inspiration. If I can get over this initial hump that'd be great. Jillian cracks me up. I love when she says 'you can't phone it in!' I'd have a problem if she were talking to children, but this is an adult workout video so I don't see the problem with her style. It actually motivates me since I know she's right. This gut ain't going anywhere if I don't suck it up and sweat!)

Day 8-Shred Level 1 (I wasn't even going to do the workout today. I thought I'd do Walk Away the Pounds, but I was angry about my dead end job situation so I thought, screw this! I can't control my situation at the present moment, but I can work out! So i worked out to release some frustration and anger. it helped. I sweated more today and felt stronger with my anger fueling my energy. Maybe I'll get through 6 days this week. We'll see.)

Day 9- Shred Level 1 (I'm still at it. I've discovered that having momentum behind me is going to help me stick this out i.e. doing the workout 6 days in a row with one rest day instead of doing it every other day (like I really think it should be done). It's geared toward getting results so that probably won't happen if I take an 'every other day' approach. Some other things I do is start walking in place while she's doing the intro talk that you can't skip. That way my muscles are more warmed up. I also bought Madeline Lewis's AM/PM stretch so I'll do that every day after the workout when I get it. I'm also going to take Epsom salt baths whenever I feel the need to in addition to continuing to slathering Biofreeze all over my muscles before I work out. That stuff is amazing! My endurance is getting better. I can do all the push ups in Lv 1, yay me! I still have a ways to go with the endurance though. I see a small difference in my gut. Mind you I still look preggo if I'm not wearing spanx, a big t shirt or camoflaging (sp?) in some way, but it does look like it's shrinking ever so slightly. That's an awesome sign. Maybe if I keep this up it'll actually shrink like other people's did in all those Youtube videos I've watched.

Day 10-Rest day (Finally! I didn't get a whole lot of rest though. Went to a party and drank way too much. :( )

Day 11-Shred, Level 1 (Up and at 'em again although I didn't really feel like working out today after partying last night. Oh well. No excuses for today. Plus, I'm so afraid of not working out and losing the fitness level I've gained so far. I DO NOT want to start this process over. It was hell just starting out with this. My lower back and upper left butt cheek still hurt for some reason. I'm powering through it though. I just keep using Biofreeze. I also iced it last night to reduce inflammation. I see my abs changing so I'm not going to stop. I SO want a flatter stomach and tight abs. I may not get 100% of that with just doing Shred which is why I plan to keep going after this with Ripped in 30.)

Day 12-Shred, Level 2 (I'm up to level 2 now. First day. It's definitely tougher than level 1. I do not recommend anyone to just jump right into this level unless you've been working out regularly and use weights regularly. Overall, the workout is fine. It's harder, but very doable for me since I've got level 1 under my belt. I felt really good after doing level 1 those 10 days. My fitness level improves daily. I still do any knee bending carefully and don't go as deep as the advanced girl, but I can do the exercises more rigorously i.e. jumping jacks are stronger, butt kicks higher. Anyhow, Jillian jumps right out the gate on this one with walking push ups for the first exercise after the warm up. I have to bend my knees all the way down then just do a plank. I tried a few push ups on a few. It's hard! At the end, you think she'll give you a break with the ab exercises. Nope. It's those plank twists. I was thinking really??? Once I get used to the exercises and perfect my form I'm sure I'll master level 2. It may take me all the 10 days, but I'm SO excited to see what my belly looks like after this level.

Day 13-16-Shred, Level 2 (So I've completed 5 days total of level 2. It's definitely no walk in the park. It's harrrrdddddd! I limped to the finish line today thankful that tomorrow is my rest day and Sunday I can work out when I want instead of first thing in the a.m. My belly is in a battle of wills with this workout and my bad eating habits. I haven't done a great job of watching my carbs. Chocolate and wine have taken over many a night unfortunately. I'm hoping that exercise will overcome the need for my body to hold onto this belly fat even though my eating is crap. The thought of how far I've come keeps me going. I'll just keep working out and finish the Shred then move onto Ripped in 30. At least working out will help keep my belly in check even if I can't or won't do better with my eating. It's hard not to drink wine after a long day of doing a job I hate. Oh well.

Day 17-22 Shred, Level 2 & 1st day of Level 3 (Yaaaayyyy!!! I made it through 10 days of level 2! It was hard I must say. I've gained enough of a fitness level that I could do the exercises with correct form and some gusto, but I still modified some for my knees and butt. For some reason, either butt cheek hurts off and on. Icing them helps. So I was ready for level 3 to be this terrible monster in the closet, but it really wasn't! I didn't sweat nearly as much as I did in level 2. It really wasn't too terribly hard. I'm not complaining because level 2 was a bear! With level 3, I'll try to do more of the advanced moves at a higher intensity level. I absolutely won't do those jumping lunges. It feels too awkward to do and my butt can't handle it. Same goes for the rock star jumps. Nope. Those are NOT happening. I am not pulling any butt muscles. So anyway, now that I'm determined to eat sensibly and do this workout, I'm hoping it'll help me reduce my body fat percentage. It looks like it takes mountains to lose body fat. I think it'll mostly depend on me eating right while the exercise burns it off. I'm just not going to see the muscles underneath this layer of fat on my gut if I don't stick to a good diet and this exercise. Period. End of story. So I'm looking forward to completing 10 days of level 3. After Shred, I'm moving right into Ripped in 30. I want a lean belly BAD!!! LOL! I've never had a problem with any other body part EXCEPT my belly. It's never been flat. It wasn't bulging like it is now when I was younger, but after having a baby, man!

Day 23-Shred, Level 3 (Today was my second day doing level 3. I take back what I said about it being easy. I worked up a good sweat today! I still think level 2 is harder though. I guess because of all the jumping around. I like that level 3 has plank moves. I read somewhere that doing planks and push ups are more effective at slimming and flattening abs than crunches. I will say that Level 3 seems to zoom by which is awesome! The circuits just seem to go by so much faster. Maybe because I'm more fit now.

So my more objective opinion (for my health, fitness level and preferences!) is this:

Warm up- There's no way in he*l I'm doing double jump ropes in a warm up. I'll do the regular ones. I don't think you should kill yourself in a warm up. That's the whole point-to warm up your muscles so you don't get injured right? I'm also NOT doing butt kicks with my past tush soreness. I do jumping jacks instead.)

Circuit 1- I love the plank exercise at the beginning. Like I said, I want to burn belly fat and flatten my abs. Planks are perfect. I think the superman exercise strengthens your back muscles and belly for that matter which is going to help me reach my goal of slimmer abs. I love the mountain climbers in the cardio section of circuit 1. I can actually do them! I'm not saying I'm not tired afterward, but I believe the upper body strength I've built up really helps me be able to do them. On to those dam* sumo squats. I hate them! I have a feeling though that my thighs are going to get slimmer and I'll develop more quad strength which I need.

Ab exercises-The ab exercises in all the circuits are fine for me except the scissor kicks. Those are hard. Plus, I don't think I have a lot of lower back strength.

Circuit 2- Strength-I'm absolutely NOT doing those jumping lunges. They just seem dangerous and I feel too awkward doing them. I do the forward lunges while holding weights. Cardio-the boxing with the weights is hard, but I like that I'm building upper body strength. I do the butt kicks with the weights during this time since I'm actually warmed up and working out, but I still take it easy. I don't do the jumping jacks with the weights. Just don't like those. I do jumping jacks or double jump ropes instead with no weights.

Circuit 3-Strength-I like the traveling push ups. Again, helps me develop more upper body strength. I still have to bend my knees with push ups. I like the row and leg lifts. Maybe those will sculpt my butt even more. Cardio-I'm absolutely NOT doing rock star jumps. I don't care what those will sculpt. My butt can't handle those. I like the jump squats though.

All in all, I'm digging level 3. Level 1 will probably be a cake walk if I ever do it again (which I probably will when I'm done with Ripped in 30 and begin rotating workouts.) I still feel a way about level 2 which is why I'll challenge myself to do that workout every now and then (probably on a Sunday when I can do it later in the day and relax afterward). It was just a hard workout and not my favorite of the bunch.

Day 24-30 (Woo hoo! I'm officially DONE with the 30 day Shred! I never stick to anything so this is a real accomplishment for me. Am I totally shredded? No. Maybe if I hadn't eaten like a pig the first 2 weeks my body fat percentage would be lower, but no use in crying over spilled milk. Onward and upward, right? Really, the only bad part about this workout is that I didn't wake up sooner and really start doing it seriously i.e. eating right. I actually did those dangerous looking rock star jumps on my last day today! Booty all healed so I thought I'd give them a try. They actually weren't that bad. All in all, I'm MUCH stronger. I can do push ups (still on my knees, but they're strong), I can do mountain climbers with no problem since my arms and shoulders are stronger. I can even do those horrible sumo squats without totally dying during the first set. Don't ask me about the second set though. :) My butt is noticeably smaller and lifted. I had no idea it had spread and flattened so much! It's hot now! My legs, arms and shoulders look awesome. These have never been my trouble spots. I have my muscle tone and definition back in those areas. The thorn in my side is my stomach. Always has been. I see my 6 pack when I'm doing double jump rope etc. but, of course, it disappears when I'm not holding it in. On the bright side, my belly is smaller. Looks like I've lost an inch from it. I have to keep going with Ripped in 30 though. I'm hoping that now that I'm eating right and following the dvd to the letter that the belly fat will melt away. If all of it doesn't I'm just going to keep going till I get what I want. I want my belly to look like Anita's or something similar. She's small chested like me so with her belly super flat everything is in proportion. I can't have the slightest gut since I don't have a chest to compensate for it. It just irks me to no end which is why I'm continuing with Ripped in 30, level 1 tomorrow.

Well, this review has been fun! If you got to the end of it I hope it was helpful for you. Toodles!",1413504000,9,16438,4.175339009776096

3317555,5,B00127RAJY,"This really was a fantastic workout to start with. I did the workouts 6 days a week, making sure all days added up to 30 (so I went for over a month, when you count the days off). I did not change my diet; I did not change anything. As a natural consequence, I drank more water. I bought her Master Your Metabolism book; and I made sure I took 20 minutes a day to do this. I wrote about my results (with pictures) at bigserious.hubpages.com.

I recommend a few things: drink water; never work out on an empty stomach; you don't have to keep up, just keep moving. What you struggle with in week one is easy by week four. It's really fun. And TAKE PICTURES. My pant size did not change; my weight did not change. But if you look at the photos, it's quite clear my body changed. So don't trust numbers! Take pictures!

The workouts are intense enough to actual feel like you are doing a workout with intention. I am one who doesn't like to workout but with this video it was a quick 20 min workout and I was able to work my self up from level 1 then on to level 2 and then finally when I made it to level 3 I was so proud of myslef and significantly stronger, more lean and fit. Not only did it change my body but it gave me the confidence I needed too. When first starting on level one I thought man this is tough but now after making it to level 3 and going back to level one I can see the major change and how much easier I fly through the workouts! Jillian knows what she is doing iv bought a few more of her DVDs since and I absolutely LOVE them as well! If your in a workout rut, a beginner or need something to switch up your routine, but this DVD, it's a life changer! :)",1413331200,2,1011,3.888888888888889

3317571,5,B00127RAJY,"Purchased this dvd to get myself into working out more regularly. Wanted a video that didn't require any additional equipment and was less than 30 minutes. THIS IS PERFECT! I started with Level 1 which was brutal at first, once I got used to it I tried Level 2 and then Level 3. I like how she has the 'easy' version in the background in case there are parts where you get tired and then the more challenging version when you are ready for more. Once you do this for a couple weeks straight the Levels become pretty easy, I started stacking doing 2 levels in one workout or doing one session from this video and then one session from her 6 week six-pack video.",1413244800,3,660,4.288
3317572,4,B00127RAJY,"The workouts are challenging, but they are not so challenging that you can't get through it.  It took me about three tries to make it through the Level one workout completely and I am pretty much as much of a beginner as you could be.  I haven't lost any weight yet, but I can tell it is making a difference around the tummy area, my belly feels nice and tight and it hasn't felt like that since I was thirty years younger.  Jillian has so many different workouts, its hard to figure out which one is the one that you should start with when you're a beginner, this one might not be the ""best"" choice for a beginner, but I think that its totally doable for a beginner, and I really like that there are three different levels with beginner and advanced versions for the exercises.  One thing I noticed, if you read the outside of the box on the label it mentions ""diet and exercise"" which would probably lead one to believe that there is a diet plan on the DVD somewhere, and I don't think that there is - but having said that, I am only on level one so maybe its on there somewhere, if you're looking for a diet plan you might not find that, but you will find a challenging fun workout that is completely within reach for someone who is just starting out, and I think you will be pleased that you seem to see results right away.",1413158400,2,1327,4.21259842519685

I do this one on days I just can't get to the gym and every time I go back to it, I end up sore again.  I know its working.  Level three really tends to tweak my knees for some reason so I usually skip it but these are awesome workouts.

3317600,4,B00127RAJY,"I have had the video for a few years now.  Started again 2 weeks ago and starting to see results.  I switch up each day and rotate between 1/2/3.  You can make any level more difficult by adding 5 or 8 lb weights depending on the exercise.  I find them equally difficult by doing this and helps the eventual boredom you can get from doing videos.

I love that they take 30 minutes total time, I like the addition of weights to give cardio and weight training.  I never lost much weight if any while doing this but certainly saw results in time.  My clothes are fitting better.  Toning is my big problem as opposed to weight loss.

I did Insanity a few years ago but got a terrible back injury so I'm fairly cautious now.  I don't seem to have any issues with this video.

I wish she had another version of this so I could add to the mix, I have bought several others but this is my favorite.  Some jumped from the floor to standing too often and too quickly, I liked that this is a smooth transition and only 30 minutes.

3317611,4,B00127RAJY,"I've done the first 30 Day Shred video many times--both as a stand alone workout and as part of the 30 day shred plan (30 days of doing each level 10 times). The first video is challenging, especially if you are not in great shape, but not so difficult that most people will find it impossible to finish. If you're not used to working out, you will definitely be sore for a few days after you do this workout for the first time! I do not recommend doing the same video in the series for too many days in a row if you have joint or knee issues--sometimes I find myself having knee pain if I don't take a day in between doing a video. You can also alternate the levels to mitigate this problem (e.g., do level 1 one day, level 2 the next, then level 1 again). The intensity of this video is definitely high enough that you will see results if you use it consistently and also alter your diet. Another plus is that it's short enough that you can fit into your day very easily!",1411776000,,973,4.1534391534391535

3317711,5,B00127RAJY,"Yeah, repeating the same workout script every day can get annoying. But the workouts are fast and effective. I have 2 little kids so I needed a workout I could do during naptime, and I did this for about 5 months. 2 months of level 1, 2 months of level 2 and one month of level 3 before moving on to Shred it with Weights and 6 Week 6 Pack. I worked out 3-4 times a week at first and later increased to 5-6 when I got in better shape. I started with 3lb weights and now use 8lb dumbells and 10 & 15lb kettle bells. I was very out of shape to start and now have lost 25lbs and am in good shape. My only regret is not moving up a level sooner at first, because repeating the same workout can be very boring. I also recommend alternating different workouts to keep things interesting. She offers modifiers at each level to make things easier or harder so it's easy to customize the workout to your level of fitness even within the same level.",1408838400,10,939,4.108695652173913

3317713,3,B00127RAJY,The workout is vigorous but there is a set with too many bicep exercises in a row. What is irritating is having to wait to listen to the advertising pitch at the beginning for quite a few minutes before you can get into the workout. It won't let you fast forward either. If I was given this DVD for free I wouldn't mind but why do I have to pay to listen to multiple ads? Jillian should get a better deal for her next DVD.,1408752000,2,422,3.976470588235294

I have lost 43 pounds in 5 months and I'm still losing. I workout with Jillian every morning and use the DVD five times a week (Monday-Friday) and take the weekends to rest. I NEVER thought this short 24 minute DVD would be able to get these results. I am a size 0 now, fitting into skinny jeans, and I feel better about myself then I have in a long time! I love Jillian's no-nonsense personality...she know working out stinks and she doesn't profess her exercises to be easy-she pushes you and encourages you too. I love that! Keep 'em coming Jillian!!",1408233600,39,699,4.303030303030303
3317736,5,B00127RAJY,"I was looking for something that was quick and effective. This DVD is it. Due to the short length of workout routines, it was super easy to fit into my schedule and I instantly felt stronger. I didn't exactly loose a bunch of weight, but that is probably due to the amount of food I was eating... went on many family visits and it is hard to resist family and grub! But I am fully confident if I ate healthy I would have lost some weight (Also I am not exactly super overweight or anything... but I could loose a good 30 I suppose lol) The only complaint is that this workout is a little hard on the knees. Now I am only 24 and have no prior knee injuries or anything like that, but my knees were cracking and under stress during some of the moves. I did read that Jillian's Ripped in 30 DVD addresses some of those problems though... and I am on to that one!",1408147200,,859,4.088757396449704
3317737,5,B00127RAJY,Another great incorporation with my already so busy workout routine. This workout definitely fun and challenging but not hard to do  I love that it works the total body switching between circuits.

I'm on a long plateau so I'm switching up my routine and using this.,1408147200,,438,4.75
3317738,5,B00127RAJY,"I have never seen an episode of THE BIGGEST LOSER and, before purchasing JILLIAN MICHAELS 30 DAY SHRED, had never used a fitness DVD before. In 2009, after several years of having no fitness or exercise regimen, I wanted to begin a training regimen to get back in shape. At the time, I didn't have the finances to afford a gym membership, but a friend of mine recommended JILLIAN MICHAELS 30 DAY SHRED. I purchased the DVD and used it for a six month period and it was extremely helpful.

Other than a tv with a working DVD player and a space to workout, all one needs is a couple of hand weights and maybe an exercising mat. There are three different workouts on the DVD. The easiest is Level 1, Level 2 is moderate, and Level 3 is the most challenging. Each workout consists of a 2-minute warm-up. These are followed by a series of 3 circuits that are 6-minutes-long. Each circuit consists of 3 minutes of strength, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, followed by 1 minute of ab. Finally, the workout ends with a 2-minute cool down. Although there are some exercises that are repeated, none of the circuits are completely repetitive.

You are supposed to use this program by working out on Level 1 for 10 days, then progressing to Level 2 for 10 days, before finally ending with a 10-day-workout on Level 3. Initially when I purchased this DVD, I followed the program. However, I ended working out with it for about 6 months. So, after completing the initial program, I started over, but would mix it up: I worked on Level 1 for a day, the next day I would do Level 3, the next day I might do Level 1 or Level 2, etc. There would also be some days that I would do a series of two workouts: for instance Level 3 followed by Level 1 or maybe two rounds of Level 2.

During the first 30 days I followed the program, I lost about 12 pounds and was definitely more toned and in shape. After six months of using it, I had lost about 20 pounds.

Overall, JILLIAN MICHAELS 30 DAY SHRED is a great workout video for anyone who wants to a workout video to use at home. If you stick to the program, it will help you get in shape.",1408060800,8,2117,4.271820448877805

3317740,5,B00127RAJY,"I love this workout video. Seriously, its three circuits and you are done in less than 30 minutes most of the time. I do not understand why they call it season 1, is there another one coming out?",1408060800,,195,4.157894736842105
3317751,5,B00127RAJY,"Effectiveness: 10/10
I'm 5'2, woman and weighed 141 lb. I was 170 lb and lost 25 lb from jogging for almost a year. Although running for 6 months helped me lose the 25 lb, this workout will help you burn off those fats and flabs if you complete this workout dvd properly. I'm on day 24 and lost more 4 lb which is great because I was on a 6 frustrating months of plaque. I don't see significant difference in my physical appearance (because I'm chubby) until day 20 or 21 which was  when I began level 3. My butt, thighs, lower arms and upper arms are more toned and firmer. It also helped me tone up to rid those stretch marks from when I lost 25 lb.

My strength significantly increased too! I gained a lot of endurance and speed since trying 30 day shred. My time for a run improved a lot than my run time before I tried 30 day shred (12 min/mile before, 10 min/mile after in a 3 mile run). I can feel more power from my muscles,  and my legs can push me faster when I run,  and I can sprint for minutes longer.

I'm pretty sure that if I do this workout again for a total of 60 days working out, I will have the perfect toned body I want. But I will, instead, try Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 for the extra challenge.

Difficulty: Very hard
Doing these workout dvd is intense circuit training. It's much more intense than my normal circuit training with my trainer who I paid $60 per session at the gym! And I feel that I get alot more workout doing this 25 min workout with Jillian than 1 hour. $12.00 for a great workout dvd is a very sweet deal.

At my current state, I'm still considered overweight but this workout is doable. It's challenging, but because the workout is so short, and Jillian MIchaels is such a great motivator, 25 minutes will zip by fast!

Motivation: 9/10
I've tried Chalean's Turbo Jam dvd workout, and Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs workout, and Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is my favorite. Unlike Chalean and Shaun T, I found Jillian more motivating, helping me push harder for another minute in each circuit. There are 3 levels of training with level 1 being doable but very tough to level 3 being almost impossible to complete without a minute break. With that being mentioned, each level must be done for 10 days (workout level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 more days, and level 3 for 10 more days). Therefore, it is likely you'll get bored from listening and training with the training for 10 days. But Jillian is tough but very motivating, and doesn't have those annoying noises and phrases that I see from other workout dvds. Sometimes, I do switch it up, but listening and working with Jillian doing the same workout for 10 days is manageable.

Overall all rating: 9.5/10
Of all workout videos, this one is my favorite because this DVD can give you more than you can ask for: burn fat, get toned, increase strength, saves you big time and money from going to the gym, great workout workout in a short time. If you're looking to get in good shape, this dvd is great even for the fittest people. Don't even try downloading this on Amazon Instant Video for $4 It's worth getting all 3 levels in one DVD.",1407974400,4,3132,4.321976149914821

When I decided it was time to really get serious about losing weight, I found the first of these workouts on YouTube.  I've been using it for the past few weeks, and I can honestly say I understand why Jillian is such a popular trainer!  Personalities differ, but I found her to be very motivating and encouraging.  I don't need a peppy, cheerleader type.  I need someone grounded who is explaining things to me - WHY is circuit training so effective, WHY do we work arms and legs together, and why 20 minutes of serious work can be more effective than going to the gym and ""phoning it in"".  She acknowledges that some exercises are tough, especially for beginners, but she also doesn't allow you to slack off.  I am now going to order the DVD so I can use all three workouts.

Lost the weight I wanted and now do it 3 times a week to maintain. Its especially good since you can do everything at home and it only takes 30 minutes. The DVD says 20 but by the time you set up everything and watch the promos its more like 30. Still my friends and I quote it all the time. Stop phoning it in etc. There really is no need for a gym membership unless you want to be a professional body builder. This should be taught at schools and even at colleges.

My husband is doing it with me too and it totally kicks your butt, or to be more accurate it has you kicking yourself in the butt...quite literally! You change things up too much to get bored with any one move. A few times I've wanted to scream ""NO...I just can not pretend to jump rope again!!!"" but only because I am so tired at that point. I feel this workout in so many different places on my body. It really woke me up to how little I have been doing.

I found that if I played music it was easier to get through the workouts. Each workout lasts about 20-22 minutes. I do love that I can get a good workout in a short amount of time.

I'm in my 30s, have had 2 kids & am 5-10 lbs overweight (5'5"" & 135ish lbs); just stopped exercising after kids though I used to run. I actually take a break from these videos to run on the off days. Jillian does a lot of planks, pushups & weights, plus jumping jacks & lunges. Yes, you will feel like you are going to die. I thought I was going to throw up a few times. My husband plays basketball but even he had to take a break & couldn't make it through the whole thing without stopping. Great, intense workout & best exercise DVD I own because it combines weights & cardio & abs plus offers 3 levels that get harder as you progress.

3317959,5,B00127RAJY,"I first began working out to the 30 Day Shred a year ago today, but never got around to leaving a review for some reason.  Since I truly believe this DVD is a game changer, especially for beginners, as well as it being my ""anniversary"" today, I felt it was now fitting to finally leave a review for this awesome workout.

First some context...I am a 33 year old Asian female who has been a bit overweight for most of my adult life. I didn't weigh myself before I began my exercise journey, but I believe I was close to 160 lbs. and wore XL most of the time.  However, I am not the stereotypical petite Asian as I am about 5'6, so the extra pounds on me were not too bad looking, except for the fact that I had a belly! I think this was due mostly to the fact that I never worked out before the 30 Day Shred (except for gym classes in school) and poor diet choices; I do shift work so I often ate again after work around midnight and eating chips and instant noodles weren't helping either.  Also, I suffered from low self esteem for a long time, so I was also guilty of ""emotional eating"", eating when I wasn't really that hungry but just to feel better.

The turning point for me was in 2012 when I went on a date and the guy (whom I met online) told me blatently, ""You would be a 10 in the looks dept. if it weren't for your excess weight!"".  I was crushed beyond belief, and afterwards when I got home, I took a long look at myself in the mirror and told myself that I had enough, and I was sick of being fat as well as constantly being told that I am (you see, I also had a lot of co-workers who were rude enough to often ""remind"" me that I am fat!).  So I considered buying a certain popular home gym but when I found out it was beyond my budget and hard to set up, I gave up and thought about joining my local gym.  So I went in for a trial period, but I was lost as to what I should be doing or even how, and I was told that I needed to set up time with staff just to be acquainted with those machines! What's worse, I was hounded by the sales there about membership fees as well as getting a personal trainer, since I was a newbie! I couldn't afford all that and just going to the gym seemed like a hassle to me, so I walked out, and felt bad as I really wanted to get in shape! But as I was leaving the gym, I saw a poster in there with Jillian's pic advertising her ""Shred"" classes and a lightbulb went inside my head! I could workout at home to a DVD!

So I asked one of my online friends, who is a personal trainer, about working out at home and she told me that it was indeed possible; I just needed a mat and some weights, for exercises like squats, lunges, etc.  I told her that my biggest concern was to shed fat, so she recommended that I focus on cardio.  I went to Ebay, and just punched in ""cardio dvd"" in the search box, and I saw Jillian's 30 Day Shred and Denise Austin's Cardio DVD at first glance, and I decided to buy both, just to see which I liked better.  I started Denise's first, but she just seemed to annoy me (no offence to Denise fans) and it was a bit dancey for me....so I tried Jillian's next; since it was called the 30 Day Shred, I decided to start at the beginning of the next month, which was July 1, 2013.  Prior to starting it, I read a lot of rave reviews online about the Shred, so I decided it was worth a shot!

On the first day of level 1, I remember wanting to die!! So many jumping jacks! I felt out of breath within 10 mins but I didn't want to give up.  Jillian's legendary motivation got me through it, although I was incredibly sore afterwards.  BTW, I never heard of The Biggest Loser before this workout, so I didn't know anything about Jillian beforehand.  I did each level for 10 days each, but I remember also doing level 3 on the 31st as well.  I did the Shred for the actual 31 days straight with no rest days, which in hindsight, is sorta crazy now!  I just kept plugging away everyday for that month and I was shocked when co-workers started asking me if I was losing weight within 2 weeks, I guess when I was into level 2, as I did sweat the most during level 2 and it was a big step up from level 1! I also remember my clothes feeling a bit looser during the halfway point.  I was just amazed that I saw results so soon and without following a strict diet; I just tried to eat sensibly and had a protein shake after my workouts, so perhaps that helped to curb my appetite a bit!

As you can guess, I was pretty pleased with the quick results of this workout at the end of that month, so I quickly ordered a few other Jillian DVDs, Ripped in 30 was my next one.  I knew that this was the beginning of the ""new"" me, and my self confidence grew day by day as well.  I didn't weigh myself at all for fear of being demotivated by the number on the scale.  Instead, I went by what I saw in the mirror as well as my clothes getting looser as days went by.  I couldn't believe that I could achieve such results with a DVD that didn't break the bank! This might sound bizarre, since a lot of people have commented on how Natalie ""cheats"" in Jillian's DVDs, but I found Anita and Natalie to be quite inspirational during the workouts for some reason.  I also didn't think the music was that bad either! Level 2 was my fave and now my go to when I am in a pinch, sometimes level 3, but I now hardly break out a sweat during level 1, which tells you a lot!

In the past year, I have become a big Jillian fan and now also have Yoga Meltdown, BFBM, NMTZ, Hard Body, and Killer Buns and Thighs (which also feature Anita and Natalie!) and I plan on getting her other ones in the near future.  I now rotate all of these DVDs throughout the week but have found that since I have gotten stronger and fitter in the year since I started the Shred, I now prefer the longer workouts like BFBM, which has boosted my results since it's pure cardio.  But when I am in a time crunch, I will do the Shred!  This workout will always have a soft spot in my heart because it was the first workout I ever did! I owe it to Jillian for all these awesome results, since I now wear a S.  I love everything about her instructional style! Yes, even her ""constant chatter"", as it motivates me and I love her quotes as well....""When you get stronger physically, it will transcend into every other facet of your life"" comes to mind.  Jillian is a godsend for the home exerciser!",1404172800,"1,444",6403,4.049128367670365

3317996,5,B00127RAJY,"If you're having trouble being motivated to do a dvd I think this is a good one.  It's a short workout but seems effective.  You don't do each move for too long which helps with not getting board or feeling like you can't possibly do more of it.  So you move quickly from jumping jacks for 30 seconds to jumprope for 30 seconds.  She's motivational, she's tells you what's coming up.  I really, really like it.  I originally bought a Tracy Anderson DVD and her cuing was just SO horrific I could never get into it.  But I really think this one will help me be consistent. I don't know Jillian from TV so maybe some of you will have heard her motivational stuff before but for me it's new and I like it.

I figured I was too old to have nice legs or toned arms at this point.  I've never done a workout DVD, but decided to try 30 Day Shred after I felt awful in my swimsuit over Spring Break.  I didn't have much faith that a 20 minute video could do much, but Jillian is seriously amazing, this workout has given me beautiful definition in my arms and legs, and my waist is getting smaller!  I do the DVD 4 to 5 times per week, plus an aerobics class and maybe 1 run per week.  It IS a butt kicker workout, but you hit every muscle group in 20 minutes and then you're free to get on with your day!  She is a rock star, she knows what she's doing!

I gave credit to a few workout DVDs I owned over the years, especially, I had done Denise Austin shrink your female fat zone since 2005, then incorporated Jackie Warners one on one training started 2008, never had any knee issues until I  order Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred in 2010. . My knees were swollen and hurt so much after 10 days following her program. Her program completely damaged my knee joints. I had to stop working out completely for over a year to recover. It was a long and painful road. Working out and staying fit is a long term effort. Once you are injured, you are out of the game.
I hope whoever read my post will be extra careful in caring for their knees while following Jillian Michaels's workout approach and philosophy that emphasizing strenuous routines that guarantee results in a very short time.
Meanwhile, thought I'd like to share with you all my favorite workout routines are Denise Austin, Jackie Warners, Tracy Anderson, Mary Helen Bowers, Rodney Yee (yoga). These instructors are more methodical and they all stress on the importance of keeping up the good work on a regular basis to see long term beautiful results, as the same time prevent joint damage and injuries.

3318057,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm 55 and have worked out since I was 25. A few years ago I was diagnosed with Hypothyroid. I couldn't do anything! I stopped working out because I had no energy or strength. After about 2 years my weight had increased by 15 - 20 lbs. , but my thyroid was back to normal by then with the help of natural hormones. I had tried to exercise off and on either walking or doing some of my other workout videos, but have had such a hard time getting motivated. Maybe it's from not doing it for so long or maybe it's my age?? I decided I needed to order a new ""better"" workout video and found this one just by chance. I read the reviews and thought ""ok, I'll give it a try"", even though I felt discouraged and wasn't sure I'd like it or that it would work. I started using it on Wednesday, June 4. Today is Wednesday, June 11. I alternate Workout 1 and Workout 2, and modify when necessary, so I'm not doing the same workout every day. I'll move on to Workout 3 in another week or so. In one week I've lost 3 lbs. by using this video, eating healthy, including cutting out alcohol and other sugars! I am so excited! I feel like I used to before my thyroid issue. I feel more energetic! My muscles are sore, but I love that feeling because I know it's changing my body! The first couple of days were the toughest, but I just pushed myself because I want to see if what Jillian says is true. I will never know if I don't try it. I also can't say ""it doesn't work"" if I don't give it my all. So, what have I got to lose, except weight and fat. I do it first thing in the morning. There's no excuse. With warm ups and stretching at the end, it's a total of about 25 - 30 min. I love it! I can see how it works because you are doing upper and lower body together, as well as cardio. It's non-stop movement and it seems to go by fast. You MUST try it! Thanks Jillian! I'll try to give another update after another week or two.",1402444800,6,1914,4.0
3318058,5,B00127RAJY,"I purchased this DVD well over a year ago, but just used it 2 months ago.  When I first received the DVD and tried level 1, I HATED it because I had such difficulty even with the beginners ""modifications"".  So, instead I used a lot of Leslie Sansone's DVDs to build up my fitness & strength level (leslie Sansone's walk it off in 30 days is excellent for beginners to build strength and endurance). A year passed by & I decided to give this DVD another try, & I was soooo amazed at myself for being able to complete level 1 WITHOUT doing the modifications!! So, I was inspired to complete the DVD in 30 days; which I did, and the results are amazing!!!  I am now hooked on Jillian, and own almost all of her DVDs!

I love everything about Jillian, from her style to her personality. She is motivating and inspirational.  Her workouts are time efficient and fat/calorie burners; perfect and ideal for a working mom like myself!

If you are an absolute beginner to exercising I would try a beginners DVD prior to this one; otherwise, you will feel discouraged like I did in the beginning.",1402444800,2,1086,4.432160804020101

I know it works well because I lose weight stuck on level 1 so I can only imagine what level 2 and 3 has to offer for my weight loss program. Once I stick with it I know I will shed more pounds and hit my goal weight. I gave it a 4 star because I wish she had amp music to keep me motivated during the DVD because doing the workout listening to her talk and yell tends to get boring and reminds me of the boring 1990's workout DVD's.

I am only on level one and it is difficult for me to do the whole 20 minutes but I know that I will. The excercises are not hard but very effective and works on every part of the body. I also like the background music. I haven't figured out how to start at the menu so I can get right into the excercises. That is very minor. I have a little problem with the ab excercises and would have liked it if she would have done a couple different excercises other than the traditional floor situps. Since my abs are not that strong it is difficult to do them correctly. For that reason I gave it four stars instead of five.

3318093,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this last year and am happy to report that I lost 45 lbs with it.  However, you cannot just use the DVD alone and expect miracle results.  You have to eat right as well.  If you do this workout yet are still eating pizza/burgers and fries then yes you will be disappointed.  However, if you eat right you WILL see results!

SIde note:  On days where I didn't feel like working out I would go hiking or swimming.  Mixing in those activities with this DVD gave me more success than any other workout I have tried.

Tip: Stay off the scale for the first 30 days.  I was weighing myself weekly to see if I lost weight and was disappointed when I saw no results.  I stayed off the scale...continued along..then when my clothes were noticeably looser I hopped on the scale and was amazed to see the results! You will build muscle in the beginning which will counteract the fat you are losing so you won't see the lbs go down right away.  Stick with it...it works!",1401408000,11,966,4.311111111111111

Then I dropped 10 pounds. It was glorious. And I did level 1 the entire month! I work out in my bedroom, so I don't have enough space to do the others.

But I kept doing the workout, at least 4-5 times a week and your body really does adapt if you stick with it. I lost about 25 pounds in three months, mostly from this DVD (and also healthy eating). The workouts are tough and you'll feel it the next day, but you're working all the major muscle groups that will burn the most calories.

I was on level one for quite a while, slowly moving up from the modified to the advanced versions of the moves.  If you are consistent with this workout, you will start to notice a HUGE difference in your strength and stamina over the course of a few weeks, and the workouts get easier.  I am not yet on level 3 because I've recently been switching between levels 1 and 2 during the week, but I plan to get there over the next few months.

3318150,5,B00127RAJY,"If you are ready for a hard workout that gets results, then this is the one for you.  Jillian is a tough trainer, no questions asked.  Her workouts are tough but not impossible.  I don't understand the people who criticize her workout dvds because they don't like how she talks through them and barks orders, if thats all you don't like, all you gotta do is put on music or mute the dvd.  For me, that actually  motivates me, because I need someone telling me I can do this particular exercise if 400 lb people can do it, and I need to hear how I need to keep going even if I want to stop or give up. It aint a cakewalk, and no reason to pretend like it is.  If you want someone who speaks in a more positive, uplifting tone, try Richard Simmons.. see what results you get from him though  I think a lot of people misunderstand her sense of humor, and take it as her being rude or harsh.  Biggest Loser has portrayed her as this callous, hostile trainer, so people take her the wrong way when she tries to be upbeat .  You can say what you want about her, but she is a great trainer and you will get results. I have no previous experience with exercising daily, and this was my first Jillian exercise dvd and I loved it.  Well, I hated it the first few times I did it, because it was so hard to finish all the reps and I HATE CARDIO with a passion.  But you need that cardio to melt the fat.  Just push yourself through it and you will be amazed how fast your bodys endurance builds up, and pretty soon you will be able to finish a full set with no needed rest.  25 mins is about all I can commit to exercise in a day, and she really delivers.  She gives you two moderators to follow, one is tough (but cheats alot!!) and the other is for a more low impact for people like me who are just starting out, and cant keep up with the more advanced moves.  I have done this dvd (as well as Ripped in 30) for about 3 months now, and I absolutely see results. Not the kind of results that this would give me if I stuck to a better diet, or pushed myself to follow the harder moderator more often, but I am quite thrilled with my results that I am now a die-hard Jillian fan.  I have lost close to 20 lbs since starting this dvd.

I recently went back and do level 1 as a warm up to some of the other workouts I do.  I just recently noticed that good ole Natalie...level 1, circuit 2 in strength.  Static lunge with a bicep curl.  She cheats!  The camera focuses on her w/ Jillian and then when Jillian walks over to Anita, watch Nat.  She bicep curls, but doesn't lunge.  Now, I never noticed this when I was just starting this dvd....but, now I know she did that, no wonder the 'pros' make it look so easy to beginners!  What gets me, is at the beginning, Jill even says (something along the lines of): 'if you want to look like this, do what she does'.  AND...later in circuit 3, I think it's in strength, Jillian hops back into the workout and says ""they don't even cheat when I'm not looking"".  Wonder if that was a reference to circuit 2 strength when Nat DID cheat (& she knows it)??
I like this dvd and would recommend it.  It might be a little much if this is the first one you are starting out with...BUT, stick with it.  Do your best and you WILL get stronger and better.  Remember: progress, not perfection ;)  You WILL see your results.",1400112000,,1262,4.243697478991597

The next day I can feel it for sure.  I'm really excited to track my progress and to see results.

3318195,5,B00127RAJY,"Oh how I love Jillian! This video is perfection. It's only 20 minutes long, so it's easy to do before work, and you only have to wake up 20 minutes earlier! She breaks it down in two ways. One, it's in three levels. You start with level 1, and as it starts to get easy for you, you move up. I've been doing it about 4 times a week for two weeks now, and I think I'll move up next week. She also breaks it down into segments: 3 mins strength, 2 mins cardio, 1 min abs. And repeat 3 times. That makes the video seem so much faster! I'm definitely the type of person who counts down until a video is done, and this just makes it seem like it goes so quickly--which is GOOD for a Jillian workout!
She really does work you though; don't think that since it's only 20 minutes it's not worth it. She does a lot of combination moves, so you're working arms and legs and abs all at once in the strength section. Cardio is fast-paced and non-stop for two minutes. The abs could get harder, but I definitely feel it afterwards. You can always modify to make them more difficult based on your level. Overall it's a great workout video. I feel like my endurance has increased greatly after just two weeks doing THIS video only, and I'm down 8 pounds (plus healthy eating!).",1399766400,2,1260,4.210743801652892

I found some of Jillian's workouts on YouTube and tried them - loved them - and ordered several. For me, Jillian's commentary is more motivational than any of the others I have tried - from the dark ages - Jane Fonda - to current - Bob Harper (also from Biggest Loser).

I was always a thinner person but really yoyo'ed after my first pregnancy. I was the biggest I had ever been. I started with the 30 day shred and changed my diet to incorporate healthier foods. I lost 8 pounds my first round and then did ripped in 30 and rotated between the two DVDs for four months. In 4 months with these two DVDs I ended up losing 30 pounds making me 117, I lost 6 inches in my waist, I went from a 38"" bra strap to a 32"". My thighs went from 24"" and 24.5"" and evened out to 19.5"". I have never felt better and love my arms in tank tops now! Anyone can do 28 minutes a day!

I watched Level 3 and think it will be fine once I am ready for it.  I have found you need to work up to the higher levels to avoid injury.  Some of the moves don't look dangerous, but you need to be careful.  I have another Jillian Michael's DVD that I like, but it was really intense and I over did it and tore a pectoralis muscle, with lots of plank/push-up moves.  I would recommend this DVD.",1398902400,2,538,4.009433962264151

To get ourselves started we began a 30 day challenge to include a daily sign in sheet and a penalty of $1 a day if workouts are skipped.  This is not easy on level one.  It was so challenging that I could hardly move the second day.  We are now on our second week and at day 6 I can feel my body tightening.  I know this will give me results if I keep going.

I did the 30 days in 40 days time doing each level 10 times as suggested.  After that I just stuck with level 3 because I was strong enough to do it and I wanted the best work out.  I have not worked out in a while due to surgery and I plan to start with level one again to build my strength back up to level 3.

I haven't tried level 3 yet. the only thing is my knees kind of started hurting.

I have been in the process of getting back in shape after having two surgeries and I decided to add this in the my working out mix of walking 3 times per week, Pop Pilates 5 times per week and now Jillian 5 times per week.

3318267,5,B00127RAJY,"I've been doing the 30 Day Shred for almost 2 months now. For the first month, I skipped level 3 and took 7-10 days off because I didn't feel like the program was really burning a significant amount of my fat. However I decided to give it another try after that break. This second month has REALLY shown the results! I'm really starting to lean out and feel so much stronger! I am very pleased with this program. I will definitely do one more month and then move on to Shredded in 30. It is not too difficult for beginners, it warms up real slow and has a smooth transition into the workout. The workout is so short by the time you think about quitting, it's already over. I personally can't stand Jillian Michaels and her ""encouragements"" throughout the videos are pretty annoying, but the results have been great.

Also, I download this to my kindle via amazon for 1.99/level and am very pleased with that. I didn't want to buy the whole DVD (that I couldn't exactly take everywhere with me if I didn't have a DVD player) and the downloads are awesome.

3318270,3,B00127RAJY,"My daughter and I have been using the bootcamp workout by David Kirsch, but wanted to try something shorter and different.  We do like this workout and we can feel that it works different muscles than the bootcamp.  However, it is kind of short and we need to pause it and do a more thorough warm up as well as stretching afterward.

A couple of thing to be aware of during this workout; 1) There is a lot of jumping (jumping jacks followed by 'jump rope').  I don't feel this is good on joints because so much jumping is done on a hard floor - but we modify the way we do it to reduce impact.  Also, we both snowboard so we are extra careful as there are quite a few moves that have potential to hurt the knees (we go slower, focus on balance of the legs, etc.). 2) There is a move with 'side squats' performed while you are doing front arm raises with weights.  We do a similar one with the other bootcamp, but this one really stressed our neck muscles. We have used these same weights for all our exercises for the last 6 months, but for some reason this move felt out of balance, so it stressed our neck muscles.  To help, we modified the exercise by alternating front arm raises with side arm raises and it feels more productive.

What we really like is that there are three levels on one dvd - so once you are conditioned to level one you have your next level right there to move up to.",1398124800,11,1392,4.167910447761194

3318302,5,B00127RAJY,"I always read the negative reviews before I purchase a product and noticed an overwhelming amount of complaints about this dvd set being hard on the knees.  I weigh 196 lbs (hence the reason for this purchase) and was able to perform all the exercises in level 1 with no issues.  I watched level 2 and 3 and there is nothing in this set that I find to be any different than the many bootcamps I have done.  I have also completed p90x and insanity and this is a cakewalk compared to all of that.  You have to know how to land softly in order to protect your joints.  I think Jillan does a good job of stressing proper form and working at your own pace, but she could probably emphasize more the need to land softly and not pound when doing some of the higher impact moves(jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope, etc.). I also work out on carpet and don't wear any socks or shoes (did this with Insanity also)

I also love the fact that it is less than thirty minutes.  There are three 6-minute circuits and although you are working non-stop through the whole thing, it is over before you know it.

When my bestie and I started this DVD at level 1, we felt pretty good about ourselves, thinking ""oh this isn't so bad, we can totally do this and get shredded in time for South Beach."" Oh but that was an illusion! The next day we progressed onto level 2 and within 5 minutes we were wondering what we got ourselves into. Oh man Jillian sure knows how to get down to business as she mixes cardio in with strength at just the precise moment of utter exhaustion.

3318334,4,B00127RAJY,I bought this video for my wife.  She enjoys the tape and enjoys the three different workouts.  Jillian doesn't act like the overly intense trainer you see on the Biggest loser.  My wife only did the work outs and did not use the diet plan.,1396656000,,240,4.288888888888889
3318335,5,B00127RAJY,"This got me into amazing shape for my wedding. It's only 25 minutes long with three different versions, each progressively harder. There are variations on most exercises, so you can use it if you are really out of shape. I lost 5-8 lbs and several inches doing this for one month.",1396656000,,280,4.509803921568627

3318338,4,B00127RAJY,This is a great overall body workout for about 20 minutes of your time. Will definitely make you sore if you are just starting out with strength training.,1396483200,,154,4.535714285714286

3318340,5,B00127RAJY,"Really happy with the results. Lost inches and gained more muscle then I've ever had, especially in my arms. It's a tough workout but well worth your efforts! I'm planning on starting it all over again and incorporating heavier weights throughout all the levels.",1396396800,,262,4.9772727272727275
3318341,5,B00127RAJY,I love my work out video. It is like having your own personal trainer at home. With a little motivation and determination you can drop bounds in no time.,1396310400,,153,4.310344827586207
3318342,5,B00127RAJY,"I thought these would be kind of easy.  They aren't!  I was SO sore the next day, for 4 days.  I didn't think it would be that great of a work out.  Buy it if you need a very efficient 20 minute work out.",1396310400,,204,3.5681818181818183

I've never looked forward to a workout before. I am feeling better, my strength is improving, and I have already lost 12 pounds. I plan on staying at level 1 for at least another week, and then move on to level 2.  Thank You Jillian!!!",1396224000,2,374,4.180555555555555

3318355,3,B00127RAJY,"I actually read the reviews and still bought this DVD. I must say, it is great for strength building and I love that I work up a sweat in just 20 minutes, however, my poor knees can not take the daily abuse. By day 3, my knees are aching and even when I skipped a day or two and tried to jump back in, my knees were not having it.  I never even got to workout 3 because workout 2 is pure torture, even the ""easy"" modification is unbearable.

I am certain there are those that can get through the workouts, I just can't and I am not about to damage my knees further just so I can say I shed a few pounds.  On to something else.",1396224000,3,626,3.875

I was still doing yoga and am somewhat flexible, but was hoping for a good push toward some aerobics to get back into the groove after a winter hiatus. Summers I tend to workout for 1-2 hours per day, 5-days a week, so a tough short workout seemed like just what I needed.

I would not recommend for those who have been sedentary for for a few months and getting started again.  I thought that is what Jillian's workouts were about.",1396137600,7,619,4.558558558558558
3318357,5,B00127RAJY,LOVE THIS VIDEO!! Back to the basics workout - traditional strength training moves. Combines moves to make the workout more efficient and effective.,1396137600,,148,5.478260869565218
3318358,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm a working mom so I only have a certain window of time to devote to exercising.  What's not to love about a workout that has easy moves in 25 minutes that will make you drip sweat after the first circuit?  I say ""easy moves"" but the workout will kick your butt.  I can easily do this in the morning before I start my day because it is fast and effective (I am really not a morning person but it is so quick that it is doable at a reasonable hour).  Even though I don't look forward to working out, I am always happy I did it.

I also have her 50 minute trouble zone DVD and I just don't like it as much simply because of the length.

Her 3,2,1 system of 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs makes the workout go by fast.  And I have a girl crush on Jillian.  She rocks and I will likely try her other stuff.  But for now, I have three great workouts with enough variety to last me for awhile, and I can build on the harder moves you can upgrade to.  This is a no brainer for anyone who thinks they are too busy to workout.  And the proof is when I went bathing suit shopping (which we all dread). Thanks Jillian!",1396137600,3,1132,3.9646017699115044

3318360,5,B00127RAJY,"This DVD offers a great workout that can be modified to your needs.  There are 3 people in the video.  Jillian tells you if you are a beginner to follow one of the girls, Jillian is moderate, and another girl is high intensity.  20 minutes doesn't sound long, but she'll have you sweating 5 minutes into the video!  I like that you don't have to buy a lot of gear to workout.  You just need a set of hand weights.",1396137600,,413,4.1125
3318361,4,B00127RAJY,"The Pros:  I love that these workouts are quick (about 20 minutes) so it's easy to fit them in.  Jillian manages to target your muscles in a variety of ways so you can feel the impact.  It's great that she shows a beginner level along with a more advanced. If there's a particular exercise that you don't like, you know it's only going to last for 1 minute before she moves on to the next one so it makes it doable.

The cons:  The music is annoying and I hate that you can't fast forward past the opening work-out warnings/beginning intro information so every time you start the DVD, you have to suffer through the opening segment.  Overall, I highly recommend this DVD.",1396051200,,671,4.414634146341464

3318363,5,B00127RAJY,"I've done one day of this from week one and also one day of ripped in 30 as well. They are both challenging and both fun. I've decided i'm going to alternate between every other day turning them in to a sixty day program. I will give an up date on day 60 to how much weight I've lost, The overall goal is 53 but if I could lose 20 in two months that would be awesome",1396051200,,366,3.7662337662337664
3318374,2,B00127RAJY,"This workout will definitely make a difference, but it is very hard on your knees. If you have chronic knee problems then I would suggest looking for something else.  I have chrondomalacia  which I keep under control with orthotics and care in my choice of exercise. Running is usually out for me, as are lunges. This workout was a big fat ""no"" for me. I only did one session and my knees were inflamed for a week.",1396051200,4,414,4.363636363636363
3318375,4,B00127RAJY,"I would definitely recommend this if you want to lose some inches. But you have to do the workout everyday along with a low calorie diet to see results. It's perfect for individuals who only want to lose 5-10 pounds. It gives you a full workout in 30 minutes, and very easy to follow.",1395964800,,284,4.277777777777778

3318378,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm someone who is quite out of shape, but I could still get through most of the exercises in the first 20 minute beginners workout.  I like that this has 3-20 minute workouts that allow for progression which means I can use this for months to come if not years.  I also like the 3-2-1 workout style Jullian uses with 3 minutes of strength moves, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs- it of course feels like an eternity while working out, but keeps the workout moving and actually you are moving on to cool down before you know it!  I can't speak to the claim that you ""lose 20 lbs in 30 days"" because I didn't workout every day.  But I still like the workout, the options that are offered, and the lower intensity example as well as higher intensity example and how well Jillian explains each move.",1395964800,,803,4.298013245033113

3318381,5,B00127RAJY,"I like that this gets you results fast. Its tough, but if you expect to lose 20 lbs in 30 days - its going to be tough! The moves are perfect for both beginner and intermediate. I feel the burn by the end of the circuit! I like that there are different levels to the workout and I choose when I move up to the next work out. I like that it forces you to warm up and cool down. I do not like that you have to watch the entire intro everytime you want to work out. You should be able to skip through it to the menu.",1395878400,,513,3.7155963302752295

3318398,5,B00127RAJY,"I loved this dvd!! I absolutely hate working out, I was a dancer for 7 years but then badly injured my knee and ankle and had to quit to do physical therapy. Naturally the weight started adding on as my metabolism slowed after going from intense 5 hour workouts 6 days a week to no exercise outside walking to class and the store.  I usually find it hard to motivate myself to work out but I decided I wanted to get back in shape so I could stop feeling held back from certain things.  Jillian is great at talking you through the exercises and continuing to motivate you to push even when you want to take a break.  The system is designed with no breaks but because of that the time flies and afterwards you are sore in the best way possible wondering how you got such a great workout in that amount of time.  Level one is enough to kick your ass, so moving up seems intimidating at first, but after a week with level one it seems more manageable cause you already start to see results.

Do-able for a beginner, but very difficult. You HAVE to stick with it (beginners), after even days 2 and 3 you start to notice it getting easier as your body changes. I'm on day 6 and just moved into Level 2 (which is much harder than the first).

I am 23, 5'4 and about 180 pounds, my ultimate goal is to lose 40 pounds, so in combination with this DVD I have been eating lean and clean... and seriously kicking my workouts into beast mode with Jillian.",1395187200,3,628,4.367521367521367

My favorite line from her in level 2- "" I want you to feel like you are going to die!""
Jillian Micheals is a beast!! and totally committed to fitting in a FULL workout in 20 mins.
My favorite thing about this workout is the time- 20 mins, non stop, workout! strengthing, cardio and abs. I am a full time mom and nurse, I need something quick, consistant and that will give me results
my least favorite thing is that I wish there were more levels, maybe even 5-7? then one could day a level a day and keep the cycle going.

Each is progressively more challenging. When I first tried it, I was skeptical about how much of a workout I would be getting. I'm used to running 20 or more miles a week and lifting weights at the gym. After trying level 1, boy was I exhausted! I stuck with the workouts and grew to love them. They made part of my body sore that I didn't know could get sore. Within a month, my waist was smaller and my entire body felt firm. I noticed that my biceps and quads got a little bigger. This is not a bad thing, as it means my muscles grew stronger. The best thing about 30 Day Shred is that it's very time efficient.

The first couple of days, my knee hurt but it went away quickly when I paid close attention to my form.  I did, however, hurt my shoulder.  I've modified some of the moves to try to not aggravate it more, but I have 7 days left in the program and I really, really want to hit my goal!

3318454,5,B00127RAJY,I've done this workout with a friend many times before I purchased it and decided I can do it on my own it definitely works if you use it. You will see inches fall off then pounds.,1394755200,,180,3.891891891891892
3318455,5,B00127RAJY,"Really great workout. Love her videos.

Fine for beginners or more advanced people. It gets your heartrate up, so it's good cardio.",1394668800,,131,4.954545454545454
3318456,5,B00127RAJY,"I really love Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred. It gets you moving, even if you're not active every day of the week. Level 1 is an excellent workout, and the progression to Levels 2 and 3 are challenging but seamless. The exercises are easy to follow, and Jillian gives you different versions of most of the exercises, so there's no excuse not to try this! I really think this is one of the better at-home workouts. You won't regret buying this!",1394668800,,442,4.469135802469136
3318457,5,B00127RAJY,"After sitting on the couch for months, this workout got me back into action! Level 1 is challenging but doable, even if you haven't been active in a while. (I cheated and took 30-second breaks to grab water during my first few workouts. Jillian would not approve; you're supposed to keep moving. Shh!)

Her approach is to combine strength training and cardio into one effective 20-minute workout. Within the first week, my muscles were already starting to tone. What I especially love: She gives you beginner and advanced versions of many exercises, which is helpful. I also like her motivational style. Just when you're thinking it might be time to stop and have a brownie, she'll pipe up with, ""I know you want to turn off that DVD. Don't do it."" (A little creepy how she can read my mind, but in a good way.) And then she'll remind you why you're doing what your doing.

The progression to Level 2 and then Level 3 is natural and doable. By the cool-down, I feel like I've really worked my whole body--upper, lower, and abs. I feel stronger, leaner, and healthier in just a month. At this point, actually look forward to working out with Jillian and her two co-trainers (well, most days).

My only complaint is that I feel like a few of the ab moves strain my back a bit, so I take mini-breaks midway through if I'm feeling that strain. But overall, a great workout!",1394668800,,1369,4.534412955465587
3318458,5,B00127RAJY,I chose this rating because Jillian has an awesome combination of exercises that are very effective.  You really feel like you have worked out when you are done!,1394582400,,161,4.75

3318460,5,B00127RAJY,"This DVD works, if you are willing to put in the work. We are on day 6 of level 1 and my stomach although not perfect looks amazing! I'm honestly addicted. I even did the DVD on our designated rest day because afterwards I feel accomplished. I normally can do an hour of cardio and not sweat, I can run and not sweat. Once you start the first circuit, it comes pouring down. I have had to rethink my hair style choices because of the massive amounts of sweat produced every single time. If you are looking for something to kick you in the butt, but make you want to get back up again. This is it.",1394582400,,596,4.102564102564102

3318474,2,B00127RAJY,"I bought this to add some strength.. something ""extra"" to my 30 minute running session everyday.  I did the entire thing.  I took before and after measurements and weighed myself as well.  ZERO change at the end. I didn't lose even HALF a pound or even a quarter of inch!!!!! Not worth my time. I am a mom of 3 and had a hard time fitting this in- and now I regret it.  Wasn't bad- but the results stunk.",1394496000,,404,4.075949367088608
3318475,4,B00127RAJY,This is a great video if you are just starting out or just getting back into it.  I really enjoy doing the 20 min workout a every day and still have time to walk the dogs after as a cool down.,1394496000,,192,3.682926829268293
3318476,5,B00127RAJY,"definitely worth it, she's brutal but she really kicks your butt. I recommend for those who are just starting out and want to get in shape. It's definitely worth it if you stick to it. Everyone has 20 minutes!",1394496000,,209,4.384615384615385
3318477,5,B00127RAJY,Definitely not for a beginner of working out but it's definitely worth it once you get there! Only 20 mins a day.,1394496000,,113,4.181818181818182
3318478,5,B00127RAJY,"Ok so how this DVD goes is there are 3 levels, you do the 1st level for 10 days, you are allowed to break a day or two during that time but not two days in a row if you really need to, personally I only break a day. Then you move onto level 2, do the 10 days with a break in between if u need and then level three for 10 days with a break in between if you need it. I have tried many different workout videos and they have never worked for me, they are normally too long and require me doing moves that are just not possible and at a speed that is too fast paced, what I really like about this workout is the fact its only 20 minutes, the moves are not impossible for me, only a few moves are a little of a physical challenge that really push me. I work out for cardio, toning and for my anxiety, I normally would get on my elliptical machine  20 minutes a day I never lost a pound doing it and that's really common, some people work out and work out but never loose a pound, I decided to mix things up and give Jillian a try, the result? To my surprise 4 lbs in 7 days, my thought was how is that even possible? I workout everyday on my elliptical and don't loose a pound, do this for 7 days and pounds are melting away and that wasn't even my intention, but hey trust me I am not complaining at all, its amazing and makes me wonder how is this so different? All I know Is my energy is high, even after the workout, my anxiety is down and this is 100% something I will be doing over and over again, once the 30 days are over I will just start again at the beginning.",1394409600,6,1567,3.8664596273291925
3318479,5,B00127RAJY,"If you are ready to sweat, this is the workout video for you!  Each level is approximately 20 minutes long. Even level 1 is challenging and effective. Great for toning and stamina.",1394409600,,180,4.625
3318480,2,B00127RAJY,"I workout regularly, usually running or biking, but I wanted to add a DVD to my workout to occasionally switch things up. I purchased this DVD because it has fabulous reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred.

The exercise routines on this DVD are moved through very quickly. Generally I like this because I am limited on time and I get bored easily. It is difficult to have good form though with these particular exercises when you are moving through them so quickly. With that being said, it is a DVD and you can pause the DVD.

My least favorite exercises generally including jumping jacks and lunges. I find both of these exercises to be boring, and difficult on my joints and body (despite being a runner). This is basically what this exercise DVD is all about...the exercises I hate. Also, I've done a lot of reading that states such exercises, as well as some of the ab workout to be actually bad for your joints and body and that there are much better alternatives.

Lastly, I have issue with any workout that states I should be doing it everyday without rest. A good trainer with absolutely tell you otherwise. Not to mention if you want results and want to stick to those results and that routine you need to do things the right way and something that you actually enjoy. For me neither of these aspects were met with this DVD.

Overall, I feel there are much better workout DVDs out there than this one. With that being said, you will see results with this DVD if you can actually stick to it and it doesn't hurt your body. For me, I prefer something more enjoyable and less jarring on my body.",1394409600,3,1664,4.5
3318481,4,B00127RAJY,I just started level 2 of the 30 Day shred and the first work out I did i felt like i was going to die but i see i am improving and starting to see changes in my body. I started my mom doing this with me. One of the best workout videos ive done. Happy with my results and im only 12 days in!!,1394409600,,292,3.5076923076923077

3318483,5,B00127RAJY,The 20 minute work out is for all muscles and she gives you a chance to modify while you are building up your health.  You can use any weight of dumb bells which works for me.  I start out with 2 lbs and working up to 8 lbs.  I am still on level one with two more levels after I master this one.  Her 3 2 1 concept really works.,1394236800,,328,3.642857142857143
3318494,5,B00127RAJY,I love Jillian Michaels and this DVD does not disappoint.  It's a wonderful workout in a short amount of time.  I'm a fitness professional and find this DVD perfect for a quick workout.,1394150400,,185,4.575757575757576
3318495,5,B00127RAJY,"Before purchasing this DVD I read through some of the reviews and I saw some where people said it was not challenging. HA! I work out on a regular basis and level one still left me winded and sore. This is an amazing workout and Jillian really pushes you! Now she does get really annoying, but I would suggest listening to her until you have the workout down, then mute her and turn up the tunes!. I am really glad that I made this commitment! After only three days I was seeing results!",1394150400,,487,4.247311827956989
3318496,3,B00127RAJY,I am 61 years old. We just had a winter from you know where. I have gained 15 pounds and wanted to get rid of the pounds.  I have bad knees. This video has too many jumping jacks with no modified alternative exercise to fill in. I am way too out of shape for this. I will start walking again when weather warms and go back to video when I can find a different set to fill on for jumping jacks.,1394064000,5,393,3.8518518518518516
3318497,4,B00127RAJY,I have the DVD and worked withit on my computer.  I find that I'd like to do this workout where I don't have a computer or television.  So I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire.  I love the idea that I can bring it with me wherever I go.,1393977600,,233,3.7142857142857144
3318498,4,B00127RAJY,"If you do this everyday, expect to change it up at some point. I did this every other day for the month and got bored it really quick. It's the same routine, with additions each new session. I did lose weight using this video, but I had to incorporate other things to stay motivated.",1393891200,,283,4.2592592592592595
3318499,5,B00127RAJY,"This DVD is great.  I know many people aren't fans of Jillian, but personalities aside her DVD really does get results.  Initially I followed the workouts like you're supposed to (level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 days, level 3 for 10 days) and only took a day or two off and by the 10th day I really could see results.  By the end I was able to run 3 miles with no hesitation, soreness or problems!

I didn't see much movement in the scale, which was a little disappointing since my reason for working out was to loose weight, but my husband assured me he saw changes within a week and said the reason the scale wasn't moving was because the fat was turning into muscle.

By the end of the 30 days I lost 20 pounds (I watched my diet, too) and may even wear a bikini this summer!  I started with 1 lb weights for the weight training, moved up to 3 lb and now workout with 5 lb weights.  I started the DVD in July, finished in August then did the workouts sporadically over the last few months.

The best part about this DVD is the workouts are no more than 28 minutes including warm up and cool down, so if you are in a pinch for time you can always shorten it or break the workout into sessions to make it even easier.",1393891200,11,1222,4.0625

3318502,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout.  I was doing Insanity and although it was insane, it was also damaging to my shoulders.  Jillian gets in all the stuff plus more that insanity does but doesn't cause injury so you can continue to work out!",1393804800,,230,4.325581395348837
3318503,4,B00127RAJY,Hard but worth it. If you use it correctly you will see the difference. Already a few pounds down. Yay,1393804800,,102,4.15
3318514,1,B00127RAJY,"I thought I'd give her DVDs a try. In my opinion, I don't feel like any of her moves are working for me. I honestly don't even break out in a sweat during these exercises. I think if someone is new to exercising, this might work, but I know of so many other exercises that give you better results than what she is exhibiting in the videos.",1393632000,,339,4.074626865671642
3318515,4,B00127RAJY,This is a complete work out in just 20 min. Still shedding the pounds and toning. It is a great DVD,1393632000,,99,3.761904761904762
3318516,5,B00127RAJY,"I have an athletic body, but have trouble working out in the winter. I have this a try and it has been awesome. I have done 10days of this work out so far and I can feel results. When I started it wasn't easy. There are some exercises that are tough and some that aren't too bad. It's a decent balance, but I know I am working hard. I started level two and it is definitely harder. Level 1 prepared me well though. I really enjoy these work outs. It's great to do regularly and especially on those days where you can't get to the gym or it's not good weather to do something outside. It's 20minutes a workout and I always feel like I worked hard afterwards. Jillian knows her stuff, let her teach you and make your body awesome.",1393632000,,728,4.170212765957447

3318519,2,B00127RAJY,"I like the structure of the workout in this video, i.e., 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of core.  It is a very effective workout and pace, and makes the most of 20 minutes.  However, I was really disappointed that there was no low-impact modification available for people who can't jump.  I have always been a fit person, but I can't do high impact  because I have had 2 knee surgeries.  The video starts right off with jumping jacks, and my knees hurt immediately.  Jillian says in the video that she will not give an alternative because she has seen 400 pound people do jumping jacks, so there are no excuses.  There should always be modifications so people don't hurt themselves.  I expected more than jumping jacks and ""no excuses"" from someone who is supposed to be a great trainer.",1393632000,2,813,4.558620689655172

While I love the workout (it makes me sweat like crazy and helps my endurance), I won't be able to finish out the 30 days because MY KNEES ARE KILLING ME! All 3 workouts consist of nothing but jumping, lunges, butt kicks, and squats. She moves so fast through each step it's impossible to ensure you are achieving the proper form with each move. My 30 year old husband (with prior knee problems) tried one workout with me and couldn't even finish because his knees were in so much pain. I have no doubt I'd be extremely fit by the end of the program, but my knees would be so jacked it wouldn't matter.",1393545600,21,687,4.172932330827067

3318523,3,B00127RAJY,"There are only 3 workouts on the DVD which gets old fast. More annoying however, is the fact that you can't skip to the menu on this DVD. You have to listen to her welcome and explain the program shpeal every time! Overall, Jillian is an okay trainer but I prefer Jackie Warner's DVDs.",1393459200,2,285,4.296296296296297
3318534,5,B00127RAJY,"I absolutely love this workout. I was one of those people who wanted to get in shape but never did, would commit to something for 2 weeks and never do it again. I tried Insanity but it was too high impact for me, but I wanted something that was challenging, allowed me to transition into it and get in shape. I wasn't able to do it 30 days straight, more like 40 days due to my schedule but the results are astounding. I skinny and I always had a belly and a slight muffin top. Those have melted away and my stomach is flat for the first time ever. My legs and arms are toned, and my back is become toned too. I have made this apart of my daily workout routine. I love it.

I don't know who's fault it was, the manufacturer's or the seller's. I was looking foward to it though because I love Jillian Michaels.....

I have purchased most of them now and every single one  is very effective, I don't get bored, and my body is in better shape then I have ever been in and I have worked out since I was 12.  Jillian brings it in every one of her workouts and I'm very happy with this DVD. I have No more trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, Yoga Inferno, the 6 week 6 pack. and I'm looking for more.",1393200000,,545,3.8482142857142856

Not sure if I actually lost any weight because I have not gotten on a scale yet, but I know I lost inches.  If only I was younger I am sure I would see a much bigger difference.  I like this workout because it is short but very effective.  It is easy to do everyday because it does not take up that much of my day.

3318561,5,B00127RAJY,I got this dvd as me and a group of friends are doing a 4 week weightloss challenge and as I'm a mom of 2 so the 20 minute intensive workout idea appealed to me as finding time to work out with 2 toddlers is nigh on impossible.  I am a total couch potato lol so this was quite a shock to the system. I am 5ft 8 and started this dvd at 184lb. I am on day 5....haven't weighed in yet so I don't know if I have lost weight but i can tell you that i feel much better about myself. I can feel my body toning up. I honestly see a difference in my body in only a few days.  This dvd will push you. My whole body ACHED for the first couple of days. I honestly don't think there is a part of your body Jillian doesn't work out. I would highly recommend. I think it's a fun challenge...it's only for 30 days...I think I an can do it and if i can do it I think most other beginners could too. Love it!,1393113600,2,890,3.728723404255319

I am on day 13 and I am always amazed at how quickly I notice my body changing when I use this DVD.
What I like most about the 30 day shred is that it's not too long but it is so effective.  So there are no excuses about not having time to exercise---I'm a mom of 2 and this is a perfect way to workout.",1392940800,,489,3.657142857142857

The obvious CONs is it is repetitive as expected with any excercise DVD so for those who get bored easily you might want to look for something else. I personally don't mind it because each time it doesn't really get any easier for me and she gives you two options to do the beginner or advance version of the workout. The other CON is if you haven't really done a workout class and had someone look if your stance and position are correct or not may hinder and hurt you. So if your not sure about how to do the workout correctly just look it up. Other than that its a great workout DVD for first timers like myself to the Home Workout DVD world.",1392854400,2,894,4.167630057803469

I thought I was able to do a lot but she makes sure you have very little time between exercises to rest.  She will make you feel good but sore for the next few days.  She throws a lot at you in 20 minutes,1392854400,,373,3.625
3318580,5,B00127RAJY,"This is such a butt-kicking workout. I have worked my way through all three levels but return to this one, adding higher weights. The technique taught through Shred (non-isolated weight training, intervals, etc), easily carries over into the gym. Also... Jillian Michaels.",1392768000,2,272,5.5
3318581,5,B00127RAJY,"This is the first workout video I've bought in YEARS, and thought I'd give it a try because of all the positive reviews - and because I'm a big Jillian fan :) I'm so glad I did!

This is an awesome video that has motivated me to get back into working out after about 7 years off (I'm a mom of 5 kids).  The workouts are tough and challenging, but I really did notice an improvement in my strength and endurance after only a few days.  After having 5 kids, I never thought I'd have the time to get in shape again (!!!), but I can do a 20 minute workout.  My 5 and 7 year olds actually like to try and do the workouts with me :)

I've been doing The Shred for a month now, and am feeling healthier, stronger and more energetic already.  I've lost an inch around my waist, have lost 5 pounds, and am getting more toned - that's without changing my diet at all, and only doing level one 4-5 times/week.  My initial goal was to lose 10 pounds and use this as a precursor to p90x, but I like this so much better than p90x that I've bought a bunch of other Jillian and Biggest Loser workouts to do instead.

Also regarding some of the negative reviews concerning knee injuries:  I have recurring knee pain, and haven't had any problems at all as a result of this video....actually, my knee feels better than it has in a long time.  Jillian emphasizes proper form quite often, so I've just tried to be careful.

Thanks Jillian for the awesome workout!

**Update** 5/20/14
This is by far my favorite workout video.  It's been 4 months now, and I usually do it about 1 to 3x's per week....not as faithfully as I'd like.  (I just got to Level 3 because I wanted to get more comfortable with level 2 before moving on, and level 2 is tough!)  Anyway, not even doing it every day and not changing my eating habits, I've lost 11 pounds and 3 inches around my waist.  I'm sure for those using this 5x's per week and following a healthy eating plan the results would be amazing.
Jillian has really helped me to love working out again!!!

I wasn't expecting measuring myself after a week and going down a whole inch in my waist and up a half inch in my hips (a good thing, since I didn't have any fat there and wanted to gain muscle). I'm so impressed and I can't wait to measure myself after the full 30 days!

I alternate between the levels so it doesn't get boring, and level one is not easy even if you are in shape. Also each level has beginner and advanced versions of the exercises so you have options. I love how Jillian talks through the video, it distracts from the boredom and discomfort I usually feel while exercising. I also love that there aren't a lot of silly aerobic moves. The cardio is jumping jacks, butt kicks, that sort of thing, no dancing.
My only complaint is that there isn't nearly enough stretching at the end. Maybe it's to keep it short, but you need to get a good stretch after this workout.

But after the swelling went down started the DVD again. I just modified the workouts and left out the lunging & knee motions. The upper body strength training + cardio & abs exercises are great.

The immense pain after the first workout lasted 2 days and then I finally forced myself to do day 2 of 30 day shred.  Like I said, I just finished day 5 (level 1) and although I definitely still sweat my ass off and feel the burn, I think I am ready to move up to level 2!  I feel good and already notice my pants fitting looser, and someone commented today on how I looked thinner (they had no idea I had started this workout)!! I am only on day 5!!  Can't wait to see the 30 day results.

The DVD isn't necessarily hard (although if you've never worked out or it's been awhile, it's probably very hard) but you'll pour sweat and burn a crazy amount of calories for twenty minutes.

I don't normally write reviews but I wanted to address the negative ones If you have never used it, you can't accurately comment on the DVD nor should you even be writing a review. If you're knees hurt or there's too much getting up and down for you then you didn't do your homework or are just being a babyand a quiter. As Jillian says, you can't change unless you push yourself so stop making excuses.

Here I am again, I have gained some weight back but I didn't want to go back to the way I was before, so I decided to give it another go. I read how great it worked for a lot of people and I wanted to lose the weight I put back on. It didn't feel as hard this time around but I still huffed and puffed my way through it, especially at the end. I will probably be sore tomorrow since I haven't worked out in 2 months.

I do weight training 3x a week and cardio 3x a week. Due to the extreme frigid tempatures in my area I needed a workout that 1).  Received great reviews (I have friends who have used it who have raved about it), 2).  Was very short in duration (I do not like workout out at home or with a DVD so I needed something that would keep my attention) and 3).  Was challenging and not boring.  I started with Level 1 and will likely start with Level 2 next week.  I worked out for the first time yesteday morning (1/28/2014) and was huffing and puffing.  This morning I was not caught off guard by the contiual movements and did A LOT better.  Next week I will definitely move onto Level 2.  If I were a DVD person I would probably give it 5 stars and although this is only a 20 minute workout, I just can't do it.  I do enjoy the workouts.  Thanks Jilian.

Don't get me wrong- even if you're in good shape, you'll find this DVD to be a challenge, but it isn't as full-body exhausting as Ripped In 30 or Killer Buns and Thighs. It's definitely a good workout and I enjoy the exercises that Jillian comes up with. Each workout has a beginner modification and an advanced version, so you can work your way up. Even though I've progressed to level 3 and gone on to more strenuous Jillian videos, I still come back to 30 Day Shred at least once a week for a good workout. Although level 1 is the ""easiest"", I follow Jillian's suggestion and add weights to some of the exercises, which makes level 1 just as challenging as level 3.",1390608000,2,827,4.2075471698113205

3318714,5,B00127RAJY,"I use this DVD when I need a kick in the butt to start working out again. I love that it takes 25ish minutes to do and actually gives you results. The first time I did this was about 4-5 months after I had my first child and I'm pretty sure I couldn't walk for days...so be prepared! I recommend this DVD to all of my friends/family members who are just starting to work out.

Tips:
1) Have a lighter set of hand weights around when you first start. It's better to finish with a 2lbs hand weight than not finishing with a 5lbs. Nobody's judging you; you're in your living room. That said...don't forget to increase your weights as you get stronger!
2) Watch your form! There's a lot of lunges/squats/planks and doing them wrong can 1) really hurt you and/or 2) not give you the work out you deserve.
3) Do not do this around things that can fall off of shelves. You'll be doing some jumping around and nothing sucks more than having an entire shelf of pictures fall mid-way through your workout.
4) Switch between the levels!!

Using this work out (and, obviously, eating right), I lost a good 15lbs. I went from a size 6 back to my pre-pregnancy size 2...and I look phenomenal naked. :)",1390435200,6,1187,4.366515837104072
3318715,4,B00127RAJY,"My wife and I got the 30 Day Shred to work out together.  We've enjoyed the workouts, and they always get me going.  However at least with our Samsung BD-C5500 BluRay player, the previews are very hard to skip or fast forward.  We end up waiting 4-5 minutes each time we want to do a 20 minute workout for previews and warnings.  Given we try to do this daily, VERY annoying.  I can't figure out whether this is a function of strict DRM in the Samsung or the way the DVD DRM is published.  Stop-Stop-Play doesn't work, 'disk menu', fast forward, etc all say 'function not available'.  Pushing stop just exits the DVD, and pressing play brings back all the warnings and previews.

Any one else having a similar issue?",1390348800,2,716,4.453846153846154
3318716,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD after a friend recommended it to me and I am so pleased.  Although I am thin I definitely need to tone up, particularly my abs.  I am on my second week and still at level one.  After I finished the first week I felt like I still needed to stay at level one because I was still having a hard time keeping up.  I have two days left at that level and can't believe how much endurance I have gained.  I am so pleased with myself.

One of the greatest things about this workout is how quickly it goes.  I timed it and it is about 26:45 long but it goes so fast. The fact that it is broken down into circuits helps it move quickly. It's one of the best workouts I have found and I've tried quite a few.

One of my goals when starting this workout was to get the ability to do pushups back.  While doing the insanity program I taught myself to do them (having never been able to) but lost it over time.  I'm pleased to say I have it back!

Jillian motivates through her typical tough love.  She offers modified versions for most exercises but not all.  For example, she doesn't allow for modified jumping jacks saying she has 400 pound people who can do them.  Having said that she does not make you feel bad if you need to catch your breath but says to take no more than 5 seconds to do it.

One downside is Jillian's personality, she is pretty dry and monotone.  I usually have music going and turn the volume on the TV down to the point where I can hear it just enough to know what I need to be doing.  Her lack of personality is not enough to make me change my mind on how much I love to workout.

This is a great workout for beginners as well as the advanced. You will definitely find thst you are sweating and pushing yourself. If you are questioning making the purchase at all, question no more, DO IT!  You won't be disappointed.",1390348800,,1848,4.0974930362116995

3318718,4,B00127RAJY,"I already had Ripped in 30, and I like Jillian's 3-2-1 system so I got 30 Day Shred too. It's an enjoyable program that ups the variety, but you can tell it's the earlier version. It's not formatted exactly right for today's widescreen tv's (all the girls look a little wide, which I find oddly comforting) and some of the moves are a little dated. Ripped in 30 definitely is more modern, with better music and an extra workout. But 30 Day Shred is worth it. These workouts are tough. I have done a lot of extreme-style TV workouts like P90X and I still find Jillian's workouts to be very challenging. I also like that they are done in under a half hour from warm up to cool down. You don't need a lot of gear to do them either, just a mat if you have hard floors and a set of light and a set of heavier handweights which you could theoretically replace with soup cans if that's all you had.",1390348800,5,891,4.186046511627907

At 5'8"" and 137lb, I'm only looking to lose a couple pounds including the pooch that I gained after having a baby 4 months ago.  I don't have the freedom of going to the gym right now & the baby isn't old enough to be in the jogger stroller so a good home work out DVD is a must to get back on track.  I can not say enough good things about this workout!  It's 30 min long, which is honestly the perfect length because who can't squeeze in a 30 min sweat session?  I find Jillian really motivating and I love her on The Biggest Loser.  She makes a really good point by stating if you want results you need to work for them...it's as simple as that.  So when I'm starting to half ass it as my thighs are burning during lunges, I find myself able to push through know that the end of the workout isn't far and I AM going to see results!  I'm on Level 1 and sore in all the right places, thighs, butt, lower abs, chest and biceps. It feels so good to have time for myself to work up an effective sweat and not have to drive to the gym to feel like I got a good workout in.
You need a good cushioned workout mat if your on a hardwood floor like me. Also, a set of hand weights. I started with 3lbs but found it wasn't challenging enough &  i love working my arms and shoulders so I upped it to 8lbs. That and 30 min and you are all set!  Good luck!!

I am a fairly fit, fairly thin female (5'5"" currently 135 lbs) that hasn't exercised in a while so I wanted to get back into it without joining a gym. I use 5 lb. hand weights with this DVD but think that may be too heavy for starting out for certain moves.
The video consists of three circuits. You do 3 minutes of weights, 2 minutes of cardio (jumping jacks, running in place, ""jumping rope"" movements etc.) and then 1 minute of abs. Then you repeat that 2 more times (for a total of three times) during workout 1. (Not ready for the other levels of workout).
After 2 days straight of this video, my calves are very sore (feel like I've been running), my chest and my triceps/biceps arms are also sore. I don't really feel any pain in my abs though, but I can do a lot of crunches before the video, so I don't really think the 1 minute of abs is enough for me.
Good video, will leave you sore the next day. I am going to keep it up and see if it helps me lose any weight. It is hard to do more than one day in a row though because of how tough it is.

3318756,5,B00127RAJY,"I'm going to be honest, I don't like working out and I never have. I do it because I want to lose weight. I started because I got fed up with looking in the mirror and wishing I was thinner. I started with this DVD workout and all I can say is: It Works! I saw results after just one week and so did my husband. Seeing the results made me even more motivated and while it isn't always easy, it is definitely something that I was able to push myself through, and if I can do it, so can you!

Here are some specifics about the workout.

** You will need a mat (if on a hardwood floor) and some hand weights (I bought mine here on Amazon: ""j/fit Dumbbell Set with Stand"" It's a 32 pound set and perfect for Jillian Michaels workouts).

** The workout itself is only 20 minutes, but she does a warm-up before the workout begins and a cool-down after the workout is over, both of these are about 5 minutes each, making this whole workout (including warm-up and cool-down) close to 30 minutes long.

** There are 3 levels. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Each level gets more difficult as you progress. You are supposed to do each level for 10 days which means that you do Level 1 for 10 days, Level 2 for 10 days and Level 3 for 10 days until you reach the full 30 days (hence 30 day shred).

** Her workouts are are a mix of cardio and strength. You will be doing things like push-ups, jumping jacks and even a little bit of kickboxing. It's a good workout and it will definitely make you sweat.

** She does not allow any breaks, because the workout is only 20 minutes long and the main goal is for your body to change as fast as possible in order to see results in those 30 days.

** She does allow and show ways to modify exercises like push-ups for example. So don't worry about not being able to keep up 100% right away, you'll eventually get there.

Her workouts are tough (I own some of her other dvd's as well), but I am motivated to lose that weight so I can take w/e she throws my way. Please don't ever think that you can't do it or make up excuses of why you can't start today or why you should wait... I was there and I said enough is enough, today is as good as any other day. Push yourself and you will see that you are able to do this. There is nothing holding you back besides yourself. So go find that that motivation and hold on to it, push through, and you will see results!  Good Luck :)",1389657600,28,2402,4.061310782241015

Day two was the hardest for me (intensely worn out and sore) and wondered if I would actually get better and improve but low and behold - she was right!  It happened.  My body adapted!  Just started level two (which is apparently level I on steroids) and am psyched to keep on feeling the improvement that I can NOW truly believe is soon to come (soon to come after workouts that are not for the faint of heart!

Note: I did not lose any more weight, but my body looked like I had lost at least 10!

I fell off with my workouts during the last half of the year and decided to start 2014 right with Jillian again! This time around I am watching my eating and incorporating another of her videos. I am looking forward to reaching my goals this year and losing not only inches, but weight this time around!",1389398400,5,663,4.28

3318775,5,B00127RAJY,"I mean I seriously read the 1 and 2 star reviews on this and I am not sure how those reviews are even possible. This program is great and as a beginner working out from home I wanted something that was not too hard but something that could push and challenge me as a guy. After having been told by my dr. that I am in fact overweight for a person of my age and that I can get diabetes like a lot of people in my family I decided to take my health seriously. With this program I have managed to lose 25 lbs in just a month and a half of using it.

Was it a push and a struggle for a beginner like me? Yes it was but as Jillian said in the DVD you cannot expect to get results without the push. I mustered through the workouts and before I knew it the weight was starting to come off like nothing. Being a big fan of the biggest loser myself I said if those people can lose hundreds of lbs on the show then I have no doubt I could reach my goals too even if it's not as big of goals as the people on that show. Bottom line I am recommending this program because it works. For me as a beginner it worked and still works. If you are more advanced then maybe this program might not be the right one for you but for me it was simply amazing I give you that.",1389312000,15,1251,3.8115384615384613

I lost at least 30 pounds with this DVD, and plan on losing more due to gaining to it all back during the holidays. You have to stick with it to stay in shape and keep the weight off, which is what I should have done. Also, I would like to add that with level 1 ALONE I lost the weight. Levels 2 and 3 are freakin' impossible (for me)! I got through about 5 minutes of level 2 and was dead. Lol. So I give it 4 stars for giving results, even though I didn't get through all levels.

3318810,4,B00127RAJY,I bought one for me and one for my daughter. I have only done level one so far but it is a good combination of strength and cardio.

3318811,4,B00127RAJY,"I would say that this one is a good DVD. There are essentially three different workout levels which you're supposed to do for 10 days each, though you can do any of them for more or less time depending on your fitness level. I will admit that I've only ever done levels 1 and 2, and haven't made my way to the end of the 30 days. My biggest issue is that I get bored; these aren't my favorite types of exercises and I don't really have ""fun"" doing them so I end up moving to a different DVD once I can't face this one any more. I will say that the exercises are great to get you moving, and they actually do get easier as you work through the 30 days. I also really like the warm up/cool down portions; I often forget to do these when exercising on my own so it's a nice reminder. Overall, I would say that if Jillian doesn't bug you (I like her, though I know I'm a minority) than give this one a shot!",1388793600,,903,3.967032967032967
3318812,5,B00127RAJY,"This workout will push you to the limit and back. It has three levels, from beginner to full on crazy. I hurt my knee pretty bad doing the second workout, so be very careful. I love Jillian though, and will continue to use her workouts.",1388793600,,236,4.266666666666667
3318813,2,B00127RAJY,"Those that watch Jillian know she can be tough. Pain is gain but as a beginner can be really destructive. Was looking for something I could be consistent with and well this was not it. By the 3rd day was aching so bad I quit once again... Also needs to be fair and noted that I was diagnosed with fribromyalgia, but either way if it says a beginner should be able to work it then I should have been able to do it.",1388707200,4,413,3.9879518072289155
3318814,5,B00127RAJY,I do this workout the two days a week that I work 10 hour days.  It's sure to make me sweat and know that I'm keeping up with the work out habit even on the days that I'm short on time or energy.,1388620800,,195,3.5348837209302326
3318815,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels scares me.  I was turned off right away to this DVD because of her reputation.  Yes, I want to work out and lose weight, but I don't want to be beat down and terrified while I do it. :)

I've always dieted on and off and this new year was no different.  Well, except one thing.  I'm getting older and the weight is having a harder time coming off.  I hate doing this kind of exercise and prefer to just go to something active and fun, but it's just not enough anymore.  I tried Zumba, but nearly died from too much cardio.  Not to mention that I felt like I had two left feet trying to learn the moves.  This video is very doable for the clutzy.

So you start with a little stretch, then you do 3-2-1.  3 Minutes of strength training with the little dumbbells.  2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs which are on the floor so you will need a mat.

Just when you are near death, she stops and moves on to something else.  there are 3 or 4 of the 3-2-1- circuits and you're done.  One more cool down stretch and you have had a kick butt workout in less than 25 minutes.  I mean you can't beat that and it makes it hard for you to come up with an excuse because it IS so short.

I'm only on week 1, so I can't vouch for the other weeks, but so far so good.  I think this is the least boring work \out tape I've ever done.  To be fair, I haven't done many because I hate working out, but this one is different.  I really suggest giving it a try.  You can't go wrong for the price!  I'm in terrible shame.  My wii fit shot me up to the 'obese' category when it weighed me.  I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was THAT bad.  Even so, I was able to get through the workout.  I think this DVD is a great fit for the beginner exerciser and the super stars.

And finally, I am no longer scared of Jillian.  I actually find her very helpful during the video, a great coach and kinda of funny!  Who would have thought?",1388620800,,1930,3.9402597402597404

I was never heavy, but I changed my body dramatically! I was able to work out in my living room with my babies! I now have a 3 and 2 year old who love doing mountain climbers, jumping, et.

3318817,5,B00127RAJY,"My wife lost 18 pounds !

After her pregnancy she was so busy with our new baby that she didn't have time to go to the gym or even leave the house much. Many months were passing by and we were almost certain she was gonna keep on most of the weight. She had never really tried these home video workouts and didn't know if it would work for her but as it turns out, it works great ! As her husband, I am surprised and as excited as she is about her results.

Because each of the videos are approx. 20-25 minutes long, as soon as she puts our baby to sleep for the morning nap, she starts the video right away and is done before she knows it, well before our daughter wakes up. Fortunately the DVD, as many people have mentioned, is broken into 3 levels and so she was able to gradually get up to the more intense workout.

Tips from my wife: To get the most out of those 25 minutes, you really need to give it your best effort and intensity during that time knowing that it will be over soon. People are probably getting variable results because of the different effort they put into it. Jillian gives good encouragement during the workout to keep you going. Also, my wife was not on any special diet, just reducing her carbohydrate intake in general with more protein instead (ie. turkey/chicken/tuna), and eating smaller portions. If she craved chocolate, she didn't completely inhibit herself from it but would just take a small piece (all in moderation to keep sanity and motivation). Don't get discouraged the first few days and be persistent. The truth is my wife did this 6 days/week one day off to relax and enjoy life.

Summary: This is a wonderful discovery that gave my wife great results and a lot of energy at a time when she was extremely emotional and down about her weight. She was persistent and gave it her best shot and she lost 18 Lbs so far ! She looks so different, especially when we look at her ""before photo"" (recommend you take a before photo, its encouraging !). I imagine a lot of others like my wife can potentially lose quite a bit of weight if they work hard at it, be persistent, and eat better! Yes we definitely recommend this workout ! At this point, rather than searching for a new workout, my wife is just going to repeat this workout to reach her ultimate goal.

My wife and I both hope you find this review helpful in your search !

I use the Trouble Zones one mostly everytime I exercize (2 days/wk) which I would rank number one because it has alot more exercises and is longer than the 30 day shred. It also targets back of the arms, butt, & other areas better. I don't get sick of it of either of these two dvds. I enjoy both of them & know I'm going to get a good overall workout. Easy to do also.

3318848,5,B00127RAJY,"This was recommended to me by a nutritionist and I just love this DVD. There are 3 workouts that are all 30 minutes. That's the most I time I have for a workout. The warm up and cool down is mostly the same between the workouts, but each workout is progressively more challenging. The workouts work multiple muscle groups at the same time and attack the abs nicely. I always notice my body get firm (esp my abs) when I'm consistent with this work out. They follow a 3-2-1 format: 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs. Usually each segment alternates between two exercises, so you don't get bored. I tend to alternate between the workouts--I get too bored if I do the same workout in a row.

My only critique is that Jillian mentions a couple of times that it's a 20 minute workout, which annoys me when I'm sweating my butt off because it's 30 minutes. Maybe without the warm up/cool down it's not 30 minutes, but still it takes me 30 minutes to complete. I know, silly, but it does annoy me. If she had a 20 minute DVD I'd probably try it.

If you like this, ""Ripped in 30"" is similar to this video except there are 4 30 minute workouts. I like this one better for some reason, but that one is very good, too.",1388275200,2,1233,4.242553191489361
3318849,2,B00127RAJY,"This came with high recommendations for my cheap-skate self who won't fork out the cash for a gym membership in the winter. I've got some knee issues so normally have to modify the program. There really are no modifications you can do with this one (she'll tell you that herself then belittle you because, ""I have 400 pound clients who can do this!""). I tried the program for 2 weeks and my body never really ""adjusted"" as she said it would I was just constantly in pain. Plus, she's difficult to listen to on the video. There was no good way to mute her without knowing the program better.

Overall I was not impressed. I've got the P90 and P90X workouts and like those much better. They are more diverse and the P90 is easier to modify if you have any orthopedic issues.",1388275200,4,772,4.398601398601398

The trick?  The exercises never get easier.  As they get easier, you just do more with better form and more weight.  You do levels 1 and 2 consecutively.  You do all 3 consecutively.  Whatever you do, all or one or two,  you still have a good workout done in less than an hour - saves time over going to the gym.",1388275200,,506,3.8627450980392157
3318851,5,B00127RAJY,"This is JM at her very best.  This routine really kicks my rear.  What I particularly love about JM 30DS is that Jillian is clear, gives good instruction, provides excellent transition between moves (if you've seen workouts that do this poorly, you know exactly what I mean) and her motivational commands are awesome.  As to the later, her motivational commands, if you were just sitting and watching this, you may think they're corny or something.  The fact that I'm commenting on them probably means I did at first.  But when you've really been pushing it and you're burning, she kicks in and demands that you push through it.  There is something about her timing, tone and rhythm that really works.  It is certainly not by accident.

The only con is that you have to watch the studio sales pitch every time you put the DVD in the player.  You can't skip though it.  I find this very annoying but it is certainly not JM's fault.

My wish list for this and all workout videos is I wish you could choose an audio option that allows you to listen to only the trainer's instructions without music so that I can crank my music while working out but not miss the important instructions from the trainer.

If you are in horrible shape and just getting back into it like I was a year ago or more intermediate as I think I am now, spend the 8 or 9 bucks this DVD costs.  It is so worth it.  If you are more advanced, I think this still would be a nice complement to your workout repertoire.",1388275200,,1483,4.384615384615385

It has really helped me get down to my pre-pregnancy weight. Previously I did not workout and I loved it because you could make it As easy or as hard as you wanted!",1387584000,,329,3.925373134328358
3318872,5,B00127RAJY,I got this for days that I can't make to the gym. This video kicks my but. Its a steal for the price. It has 3 levels and each one will get you sweating and out of breath!,1387497600,,171,3.526315789473684
3318883,5,B00127RAJY,"This is the best Jillian Michaels DVD. Its only 20 minutes and its hardcore. Three levels. It sucks while you're doing it, I kinda feel like I'm going to die, but I saw results FAST. And since its only 20 minutes, I have no excuse not to do it. She recommends doing this two days in a row, then one day of just cardio, then two days of the video, then a rest day. The first level sucked (I do not like push ups) but the second level is great. There is some impact- jumping jacks, high knees, etc, but its not too bad. I haven't gotten to the third level yet.",1387497600,,558,3.9910714285714284
3318884,5,B00127RAJY,The video is fun and really gets you going. Its pretty easy to follow. I had a mat and some light freeweights laying around so that was no problem but you really don't need anything but the dvd.,1387497600,,194,4.131578947368421
3318885,3,B00127RAJY,"This was on okay work out video. I've used better. I think maybe if someone else was doing the training, I'd like it better. Just wasn't really feeling Jillian for some reason. Oh well",1387497600,,184,4.4411764705882355
3318886,5,B00127RAJY,"Inexpensive way to stay in shape.  Great levels that you build up to with modifications for beginners.  All you need is some hand weights and motivation.  Eating plan is not included, but I ascribe to the everything in moderation combined with alternating these workouts, and I've seen results in one week.",1387497600,,306,4.96078431372549
3318887,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD at the recommendation by my sisters.  It collected dust on the shelf for several months before I ever even opened it.  I have been a gym devotee for the past 14 years, and thought that working out at home was dumb and pointless.  And duh, how was I supposed to really get a good workout in in 20 minutes?

Then I actually OPENED the DVD and tried it a few months ago.  Wow, it was not what I expected at all!  I literally felt tired and exhausted after 20 minutes.  I loved it!  I didn't follow the standard progression of doing each one for several days, then moving up.  I go back and forth with the workouts to prevent boredom.  I also modify them a little if some of the jumps are bothering my knees, or if I feel that a sequence isn't challenging enough.  I don't know if I lost any weight from the workouts, I am already a thin/athletic build and wasn't really needing to lose weight. However, I DEFINITELY look more toned, and I am a lot stronger!  Jillian has changed the way I think about working out, and has changed the way I work out even when I'm at the gym.  No more ""phoning it in.""  =)

I do have a few issues with the workouts. First, the warm ups are not long enough at all. I generally warm up on my own for a few minutes before starting the DVD. Also, I wish the workouts were a bit longer, at least 30 minutes.  However, I am aware that Jillian designed these DVDs for people who are busy and have difficulty finding time to exercise. Sometimes I will do one of the workouts, then part of another.  Also, the plyometric (jump) training seems like it is pretty hard on the joints.  I have a semi-bad knee, and some days it hurts and I need to modify the workouts.  Or I just do Yoga Meltdown. But all in all, I am thoroughly impressed!  I have bought two more of Jillian's DVDs and now only go to the gym about once a week.  Jillian kicks my butt the other days!",1387411200,,1900,4.136612021857924
3318888,2,B00127RAJY,"I started by using this video 3-5 times per week. After two months I had to stop because of knee problems, which are still giving me grief six months later. I now realize I should have eased into it. She makes you do SO SO many squats that I developed problems with my IT band. I am 30, a runner and hiker, am not overweight (125 lbs) and never had these problems before. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone...my body must be predisposed. A word of warning--BE CAREFUL!--if you start hurting stop immediately! My knees started giving out when I would squat to pick something up and the stairs were a huge problem for me. I think the repetitive movements in the video caused inflammation and rather than stopping and letting them calm down, I kept pushing myself and it resulted in injury.",1387324800,,791,4.5
3318889,5,B00127RAJY,I absolutely love this work out. Jillian absolutely gives me a great work out! I am satisfied every time I workout.,1387238400,,115,4.523809523809524
3318890,5,B00127RAJY,I recommend this to anyone.  This is Jillian's best video.  The workouts are only 20 minutes but they are a good workout.  I go to the gym regularly and this still gets the blood flowing for me in a pinch.  I know that even a beginner would benefit from this video because Jillian is very motivating and has you think about why you want to work out.,1387238400,,349,4.164179104477612
3318891,3,B00127RAJY,I think this is for more advanced workouts. Def not for starters. I would say buy this only if you are in half way decent shape.,1387238400,,128,3.9615384615384617
3318892,5,B00127RAJY,Awesome toning and shaping of the body... I've done this three times so far and have had great results each time.,1387152000,,113,4.428571428571429

3318904,5,B00127RAJY,I love Jillian Michaels' videos.  They really helped me to get back into exercising and losing weight.  This one is terrific because it is only 30 minutes.  There are three levels and each of them are good workouts in and of themselves.  I am still up to the second level.  My kids also join me sometimes.,1387152000,,305,4.375
3318905,4,B00127RAJY,"Compared to the other 3 videos I have of here this one is my least favorite. I had gotten 4 different videos so that I could rotate them through the week and it is too similar to the Ripped in the 30 (which I like better than this one) I was hoping to get 4 different work outs but the Ripped in 30 and 30 Day Shred are very similar. It's not a waste of money and still has great work outs. Not comparing it to any other videos I just wish that each workout were a little longer, at least 30-35 min each.",1387152000,,504,3.855769230769231

Then it gets better. =) I lost 20 lbs doing level 1. I probably wouldn't have my small child in the room while she's talking, but I'm pretty conservative.",1386720000,2,318,3.984375

3318928,5,B00127RAJY,"This is absolutely an amazing work out video. First off I want to address some issues other reviewers had. Many people seem to be having a problem with having to watch the previews. Im not sure why but I haven't watched them since the first day and im on day 5. I just stick it in and goes straight to the main menu. This might be bc I watch it on my Xbox?

Another reviewer said this cant be watched in thr US. Totally not true. Im in the US. Im on day 5. Everything is great.

Now on to the product - It is the real deal. There are 3 different levels. I have been working out a few months now and thought level 1 was gonna be a breeze. Not! I found myself seriously struggling to keep up. I had to talk myself to it. Im still on level 1. I don't feel like im ready to go to level 2 just yet. Honestly kinda scared to lol.

I have already already noticed some changes in my waste and my face.  It feels really good.",1386720000,2,916,3.8823529411764706
3318929,4,B00127RAJY,"Solid workout in 30 minutes. I bought this dvd w/ little expectation but I was pulled in w/ the idea of being able to burn a decent amt of calories in only 30 min. These 3 workouts are great for days you don't have time or are just not that into working out, so that you are still killing calories. I rotate these smaller workouts w/ some of her extended dvds to keep it interesting and to work different body groups. I have been on a ""Jillian"" dvd rotation(30 min shred, metabolism boost, 6 week abs, advanced shred) for about a month and I feel great and I am super toned and feel strong. I can see definition in my body but I cant' really say that I have lost weight but I think that has more to do w/ my diet.  My only warning is that if you tend to build leg muscle and booty muscle quickly beware because w/ all the jumping and squats and burpies in her video circuits your legs and booty will be pumped up! So if you aren't looking for that just be cautious ;)",1386720000,,967,4.06282722513089

If you are persistent and keep going, you will see much more results than me. When I get the time, I will be committing to it!",1386633600,,371,3.8181818181818183
3318931,4,B00127RAJY,"The order arrived quickly, and it is definately a workout. The only thing I dislike is that you can't forward through the introduction to the actual workout because they go on and on about ""the biggest loser"" and a few other things. I pop it in, take care of what else i need to do, and by that time the screen is prompted for me. Definately stick with it and you'll see results.",1386633600,,379,4.205479452054795

I love it because I am insanely uncoordinated when it comes to exercise videos, and i always feel lost.  This video is so easy, but so effective.

I do find some of the upper body exercises are too tough but I guess that's what you need to work toward. I would recommend doing the cardio (butt kicks, jumping jacks, jump rope) on a yoga mat if you're working out in a basement as it's a bit tough on the joints/knees.

This video goes in six minute circuits: 3 minutes of strength training, followed by 2 minutes of cardio, followed by 1 minute of core work. Just when you feel like dying, you move on to something new and you can breathe again. The only thing I would say to watch out for is if you have bad knees.

Because the workout is so short you can't ""phone-it-in"". The way that the strength, cardio and abs are broken up is nice because your muscles get (a very short amount of) rest in between. The warm-up is great. During the cool down I generally do additional stretching because it goes a little fast. The last level is very challenging, don't get discouraged the first few times you do it. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is level 3. Level 3 is a bit hard on the joints (especially knees). I do modifications so my knees aren't so sore.

3318982,1,B00127RAJY,"Wow, not sure how this received so many 5 star reviews! The techniques she uses are NOT good for the knees and back! I have tried just about every workout dvd there is and am a big runner, but I have NEVER had knee pain until I did this BEGINNER section. The butt kicks and reverse squats as cardio and other moves in other sections are so bad for the knees.

I had pain climbing stairs for almost a week after doing the beginner workout ONCE!

To be fair, I did read reviews about knee pain, but I figured they must be inexperienced or overweight. I weigh 130 after having had a baby 8 mos ago and saw this recommended on several baby/pregnancy sites which is pretty scary since abs and back muscles are not able to support you doing these twisting and jumping moves. I can go out and run 5 miles with no problem and do any of my other workout DVDs but this one gives me knee and back pain.

I tried the other levels too and it doesn't get better. This one's going in the trash.

3318986,5,B00127RAJY,Love this DVD. Jillian Michaels is a beast and makes you work your butt off. It is only 3 workouts for 30 days though so it can become a little boring.,1384819200,,151,3.903225806451613

I've been lifting weights and doing a short run a couple days a week for years.  This video was actually difficult!! I loved it! It used different muscles than I was used to using.  And the continuous weights instead of just a set at a time is tough.  Again, I'm loving it.  And I love that it's only 20 minutes.  I can find 20 minutes in my morning to get this done, but was having a hard time finding an hour for my other routine right now.",1384732800,,548,4.05607476635514

3318990,4,B00127RAJY,"I bought this dvd a couple years ago and I keep returning to it whenever the weather gets cooler and I need to workout indoors. I personally do not like Jillian's personality; I find her egotistic and annoying. So, I am amazed that I actually like her exercise dvds. I think it is the 3-2-1 that I like; each circuit is a limited time and she breaks it up with different exercises that I am able to complete. In fact, her dvds are the only ones that I use repeatedly. I like the exercises so much that I am able to overlook her personality traits and focus on the workout.

Unlike some reviewers, I like that Jillian does not do all the exercises herself. One thing I find irritating on some videos is when the instructor is huffing and puffing while trying to tell how to do the exercises. I wish more instruction would be given on proper form. Once I became familiar with the exercises, I looked up how to do them properly. As for pacing, I do not try to keep up with the pace on the video and prefer to go at my own pace so I can pay attention to the proper form so I do not injure myself.

One thing I have difficulty with are the number of exercises requiring the plank position. I injured my wrist and am unable to hold that position.  Several reviews mentioned issues with their knees, but mine is my wrist. Level 1 is manageable but level 2 is too painful. But then, this is a dvd that I am working out to it on my own and I need to use my own judgment as to what I can or cannot do. This is why I am giving a 4 star rather than a 3 star review. In addition, it is also why I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 because when she says that she a 400+ pound people able to do jumping jacks and therefore there is no reason why you [whoever is listening] cannot do jumping jacks.  I find that remark to be irresponsible for a trainer to be giving. (This is my opinion because everyone has different needs and circumstances. Just because some one can do something that does not set the standard for me being able to accomplish that same task.)

I have to say that level one of the 30 day shred is one of my favorite routines and I often use it as a warmup before I go for my run.",1384560000,,2179,4.046403712296984

3318997,5,B00127RAJY,It's my first DVD with Jillian Michaels. It's very challenging and shapes up your body. After each exercice I really feel that my entire body works hard. I did not use to exercice so at first I was very very sore. This DVD is very effective and after 1 month I feel that my body has shaped up. Only after 3 weeks I started the level 2 and it was very challenging. I believe level one is still challenging whenever I want to switch back to it. Not yet up to level 3. But the results are so motivating and it feels so good at the end of each workout that although it is challenging I keep doing it every day. Really worth a try.,1384214400,,626,4.016
3318998,5,B00127RAJY,"This is an amazing workout.  I started seeing results in 2 weeks!!  I have done Insanity and Turbo Jam.  This is just as good, 1/10th the price and only 20 minutes.  When I did Insanity, I could barely move some days after working out.  Not so with this workout.  It is challenging but not so challenging that you can't get it done.  I can't wait to try more of her workouts!!",1384214400,,376,4.211267605633803
3318999,5,B00127RAJY,"And I've tried many. I'm one of those ""have 10-15 pounds to lose"" types which can be very hard to overcome that last set of pounds. (I've lost 9 so far.) Now, it's not solely due to this video.... I drastically changed my eating habits to higher protein / lower glycemic carbs only. Not low carb but only good carbs that don't spike blood sugar. This is actually what Jillian and many others suggest and I've seen it work in my own weight loss. (I got one of her cookbooks and one of the Biggest Loser cookbooks to help). I started this video about 2 1/2 weeks after I began to exercise every day with a variety of videos. But this hard workout really makes you feel like you are making best use of your time. If you are pressed for time, do this video! I have an elliptical and the way I feel at the end of this video doesn't compare! It's so much harder and a much more efficient use of my time exercising.

I'm on day 11 / level 2 now. (No, I did not do them 11 days in a row like some think she tells us to do.) I did about 2 in a row, then 1 day of something else like Yoga, then repeat, then day off to fill out the week.  I had already lost some weight before I started this video, but have lost more since and I've seen a huge improvement in inches lost around abs / waist, which was my biggest problem area, since I started this and lowered my body fat percentage. And my endurance has really improved.  But I haven't lost much in my legs and think Level 1 wasn't quite hard enough on legs but level 2 feels like it does more with legs.

I did level 1 all 10 days. I gradually increased the weight where I could, normally using 5 or 8. I wish I had started with 3 b/c I was WAY sore after the first workout. But after that one, I had no trouble continuing each day.  (Anyone else think the first cycle of strength on level 1 is the hardest of them all? Yikes! It was still way hard on my 10th day!)

The abs are a little too easy on Level 1 but improve on Level 2. So you may want to plan a little extra exercise on your own if that is a trouble area.

Just know though this is not 20 minutes. Plan for 30. Each video is about 27 ish minutes. I think she doesn't calculate the warm up or cool down when she says give her 20 minutes a day. But it's 20 minutes of the hard core stuff. Consider this video if you want to work hard in a short amount of time.

UPDATED:
I just have one day left of 30 day shred. It took me about 7 weeks to get through it. Ave. about 4x per week on the shred video and 2 days doing something else.

When I finished the 10 days of level 1 it still felt hard to me. But after mostly finishing level 3 when I took a lighter day to do 1 after a hike made my legs sore, level 1 was easy. It showed me how much better shape I am in cycling through the program. I've never experienced big results like this before with any other video or program.

From the 2nd week of Oct til now (mid Dec.) I've lost most of the weight I set out to lose and a lot of that is body fat.

I just have one suggestion on Level 3. The hardest move is when she wants you in a plank with weights under your hands to lift. But with all of your body weight on one hand at a time, it hurts too much b/c weights are too hard even with neoprene covers. I tried the same move without weights and still felt like my arms were getting a great workout (because they take turns holding a lot of your body weight.)

My legs got much more muscular after getting into Level 2-3 and abs workouts are much better than 1. I had mentioned 1 wasn't enough on the legs or abs. That gets fixed with 2-3. I was able to do an extremely difficult hike up a mountain at the 2/3rds part of this program. I could never have done it without having gotten in shape through this video first. I've lost over 3"" around my waist/abs area. And 13 pounds total loss.",1384128000,3,3839,3.945736434108527
3319000,4,B00127RAJY,"Jillian is a tough taskmaster.  How does she manage to motivate through a dvd?  I don't know, but she does.  She makes me think I can do this, when I just want to give up.  The workout is difficult.  You will not feel shortchanged even though it is less than 30min day.",1384128000,,269,4.096153846153846
3319001,5,B00127RAJY,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DVD!  Okay, so I started a diet and exercise program back in March of this year as I had 50 pounds to lose.  I started running 1-2 miles 5 days a week and now run 3-4 miles 5 days a week.  I lost my first 40 pounds but have been unable to lose the last 10 (very stubborn) pounds.  I have watched and maintained a healthy diet, quit all my soda, candy and crap and have really stuck to it, so it was upsetting that I could not get this last 10 pounds off.  I searched the web thinking I needed to do more than just cardio and came across Jillian Michaels 30 day shred. I thought, wow only 20 minutes a day? I can do this. Well let me tell you. I burned just as many caloriesa with the 20 minute workout as I do running 2.5 miles.  And, I thought I was in pretty good shape and when I do the workouts, I can feel muscles I didn't even know I had.  If anyone is considering buying this DVD, you totally should. Definitely has made a difference. My abs, back and thighs are getting toned, and I feel great.

There are a few reviews that say Jillian is annoying or you get bored with doing each of the 3 levels for 10 days.  I have not been bored.  The time flies by and I have so much energy.  I can't wait to purchase another one of her dvds.  Great buy!",1383868800,4,1273,3.9105058365758754

3319006,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for something to help me get started on my journey to losing my I'm-having-a-baby-so-I-can-eat-anything-I-want weight, about 45 pounds of it. I prefer yoga but I know I'm going to need more than that to get this weight off, and I need something quick that I can do while my kids nap and still have time to switch out loads of laundry, pay bills, etc. I also haven't had a proper workout since before I had my first child, almost 2 1/2 years ago, so I knew any workout I attempted would be difficult, so why not just take the plunge?

Today was day one, so this review is based on first impressions.
When the DVD starts Jillian tells you she is very tough. This is not an understatement. I began on level 1, doing the modified poses for beginners and using no weights. She starts with a quick warm up, but I am so out of shape that I was already starting to feel that burn start by the end of the WARM UP!
At 5 minutes in to the workout I was cussing her. At 10 minutes I started to fall off pace, simply unable to jump every now and then, needing a quick rest here and there. Around 15 minutes I knew I was close to the end but my body was just saying no, my wobbly legs would not lift me off the ground for jumping. Then Jillian said something like she knows you want to quit and just turn the DVD off right now, but the end is where you do the most good and to just keep pushing. I couldn't believe it but her words really helped me when I was about to stop. I pushed harder and felt a burst of strength come through my body and I finished the workout! She really did motivate me then, and she has a lot of the same talk through-out. I really enjoyed her tough-love approach.

So how was it? Awful. Do I want to do it tomorrow? Yes!
After the cool down I sat on the couch for a couple minutes and then got up to get some more water, thinking my legs felt pretty good. Walking back to the couch my legs felt like they might give out. The burn lasted long after the workout. I expect that my muscles will feel like they've been put through the grinder tomorrow, but I also know that if I keep pushing myself through this workout (and stick to my diet) that I will start seeing results in no time.",1383782400,7,2236,4.079545454545454
3319007,5,B00127RAJY,"This totally works!! Best workout tool I ever bought. She is great at explaining everything, including ways to do various moves either more intense or a little more easliy depending on your body strength.",1383782400,,204,5.029411764705882
3319008,5,B00127RAJY,This is a really great workout that doesnt take a lot of time. I tend to get really bored with workouts that are long but this one is short and effective which is exactly what Im looking for as someone who works full time and has a family!,1383696000,,239,4.0
3319009,5,B00127RAJY,Great workout in only 25 minutes! The different levels are challenging and the 3 2 1 interval training principle gets results. Nice to have both beginner and more advanced moves to choose from.,1383696000,,193,4.878787878787879
3319010,4,B00127RAJY,"I like this DVD a lot! After the first day, I was so sore, but I pushed through and feel great. I'm a mom with 2 kids, my oldest is 2 and the baby is 7 months. No way do I have time to hit the gym every day, but this is short enough that I can fit it in while the baby sleeps and my oldest watches an episode of Little Einsteins. After 4 days on level 1, I wasn't quite feeling as satisfied after the work out, so I upped to level 2. Loved it. I don't feel like I've lost weight or inches, but I FEEL better, and that's the important thing to me.

Update:
I put this tape away for a while. Ok, really, for about a year and a half. When I wrote this review originally, my son was 7 months old. Well, he just turned 2, and I decided it was time to start working out again. I eat fairly well, and with my diet alone, I tend to hover around the same weight. I don't gain, but I definitely don't lose either. I started this work out again one week ago, determined to make it through the whole 30 days. I didn't modify my intake, just started adding the work out. In 1 week, I will admit that I haven't lost any weight. In fact, I gained a pound. But! I'm so excited to announce that I've lost 1 inch off of my hips and thighs. I'm still on level 1. My goal is to do level 1 for 10 days, then level 2 for 10, level 3 for 10. Im really happy to be losing some stubborn inches of post-baby weight, and I can't wait to see the results after 23 more days!",1383609600,,1445,3.8006644518272426

3319012,2,B00127RAJY,"I can only say two good things about this video and they're both kind of the same thing:

1. It is challenging
2. It is probably effective

I have been physically active my entire life.  My parents had me in dance lessons by the time I was 2-years-old.  I danced past high school and remained active afterward.  I am now 30-years-old.  I am no stranger to working out.  I know the importance of reps and strength training combined with aerobics but COME ON!  This video, while challenging, is pretty much like my high school gym classes.

Jumping jacks.
Push-ups.
Fake jump roping.
Crunches.

It lacks character and variety as the same movements are used over and over.  I get so bored I can hardly stand it.  When you are working out and having fun, you don't think so much about how you feel tired or your muscles are sore but with this work out, you feel every. last. rep. because you are SO bored!  I put it away for a year.  This morning, I thought I'd give it another try to make sure I really didn't like it.  Yep.  I popped it into the DVD player and walked away about 8 minutes later.

I have never seen 'The Biggest Loser' so I was not familiar with Jillian Michaels' style before I bought this DVD.  She will begin a movement and do maybe 2 or 3 reps and then stand up and start walking around the room, calling her models ""Buddy.""  It's weird.  I get the sense that even Jillian Michaels is bored out of her mind.

If this is your style, then by all means, you'll be happy and I'm sure you'll see results.  If you are used to variety in your workouts - if you like to have fun and learn new things, this isn't your video.  Just do jumping jacks, crunches and push-ups on your own and save yourself 9 bucks plus shipping",1383523200,4,1731,4.258461538461538

The first day was tough since I haven't really 'worked out' for about a year..besides taking an occasional walk or bike ride and being a 23 year old female I figured I should get in shape for the summer time! Like I said, I've only been doing it a week but in that week I lost 3 lbs and I didn't even do the DVD everyday! Obviously, you have to be eating right, too. I've been using the myfitnesspal app to count my calories (I highly recommend that app, it's a lifesaver). I am going to do this workout for longer than 30 days though--I've seen people call it the '60 day shred'..especially since I don't do it every single day (I try at least 5 days a week). I also love that you get a nice workout in a small amount of time-my work schedule doesn't give me much time to go to the gym so this 27 minute video is amazing and I feel great afterwards.

3319022,5,B00127RAJY,"This video is awesome! Jillian uses a 3-2-1 approach with strength, cardio and abs  this DVD has 3 sets of workouts, levels 1,2 and 3. 1 is for beginners but will give someone who works out fairly regularly a run for their money. This is a tough workout- but it's quick! This is a DVD everyone has time for, as it only takes 20 minutes and the only equipment needed is a mat (for us hard-floor folk) and some hand weights. It offers modified versions of exercises in each level too.
Jillian provides the motivation we've come to expect while focusing on good form. If you follow a good diet and do this DVD like you should, you WILL see results!

I wish I could fast forward through the very beginning talk. It's not that big of a deal, but if she ever decided to re-release it, that should be addressed =p",1383091200,,811,4.300653594771242

Not only did I lose the extra lbs. but I was in the best shape probably in my life! I had tons of energy and my first ever 6 pack.

3319029,5,B00127RAJY,Love the 30 Day Shred video for quick workouts. The different levels are great and challenging. Good addition to gym or any home routine.,1382745600,,137,4.75
3319030,5,B00127RAJY,"Great exercise video.  Each level gets increasingly more difficult, but you can mix it up and just not do it like its meant to be done. That is how I like to do it for variety.  It's great and I only really do it on my days off of work.  If this 57 year old body can do it , so can you !",1382745600,,287,3.453125
3319031,5,B00127RAJY,"All 3 levels kick your butt & really make you work out. In a month and a half I lost 12 lbs doing only this DVD. I didn't even change my diet. I have a ways to go, but seeing how well this DVD helped me definitely kept me coming back daily!

I do this every morning M-Sat taking Sundays off.",1382659200,2,291,3.7704918032786887
3319032,4,B00127RAJY,"I have only been doing this workout for about a week, so I will post updates if anything changes. Here are my initial impressions:

--I started with Level 1, and didn't use weights simply because I couldn't find mine. In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't, as I was really sore the next day, even though I walk regularly and lug my 25-lb toddler around. This workout really seems to work all muscle groups.

--The workout is not 20 minutes start-to-finish. It is 20 minutes, not counting the warm-up and cool-down. Not a big deal to me, but those few extra minutes make a difference in how I budget my time to fit it in my schedule.

--My biggest gripe is that I have to watch the whole beginning part of the DVD every time I do the workout! I can't fast forward or just skip to the menu, which adds another few minutes, which does add up when I'm trying to squeeze it in during my baby's nap. I just have to start it before I'm actually ready to work out and let it sit on the menu screen until I'm ready.",1382659200,,1000,4.197916666666667
3319033,4,B00127RAJY,"I'm an avid cross-fit bootcamper but I recently went back to school in addition to working full-time and having a family. My crossfit schedule didn't fit into my lifestyle, but the 20 minute workout by Jillian Michaels does. I'm a big advocate for getting out of the house but during busy schedules, I think this is a good alternative.

I've never had any problems with tendons, ligaments, etc. Maybe because I'm used to doing exercises that are strenuous on the joints.",1382659200,,470,4.802469135802469
3319034,4,B00127RAJY,this is a good solid workout.  the 3 levels let's you continue to mix it up even after the first 30 days. some of Jillian's comments are annoying (especially when you hear them over and over and over...). but after a while you may know the routines well enough to switch to the music only version.,1382659200,,297,4.303571428571429

3319036,5,B00127RAJY,"I used this workout program to jumpstart my weight loss efforts--and that it did. I measured and weighed myself (as suggested) before I started; at the end of the thirty days, I lost 22 inches and 12 pounds! I've used nothing but Jillian workouts to lose the next 50!!!

It has got my soft wlinterized body into shape again just in time for summer.  It is tough, but because it is only 20 minutes you tend to give it everything you have got.  I am 55 so it is not just for young people.  Excellent stuff.",1382486400,,335,3.955223880597015

3319043,5,B00127RAJY,"I wanted to try something new to get myself prepared to go back to to the gym on a regular basis. My goal is to lose 15lbs that I gained in a year. Dieting does not work for me because once I go back to eating what I would normally eat, that's when the pounds start to pack on.

I decided to just change my portion size but still eat what I want. I also incorporated more water in my diet because I'm not a water drinker. So here's the results so far.

I have lost 8 of the 15 pounds I wanted to lose! I am on Day 3 of level 3 and hoping to lose at least another two lbs by the time I am done with the dvd.

I took 5 days off to give myself and my muscles a rest because you will have days that your sore. I think the workouts are for everyone no matter what your ability is.  Give it a try!",1381968000,4,791,3.662721893491124

3319046,5,B00127RAJY,although i have yet to challenge myself to do the full 30 day shred just using these workouts on occasion is killer.

The 20 mins go by pretty quick and after i learn the routine i usually just put the tv on mute and play my own music.,1381968000,3,316,3.803030303030303
3319047,4,B00127RAJY,I love this workout DVD.  Would workout twice a day on this and lost 19 pounds in a little over a month.  Jillian can be very annoying in that she doesn't actually do that much working out.  Its a great start for someone wanting to start a workout program.  Im greatful for the weight I have lost using this video but have moved onto something more challenging now.,1381881600,4,365,4.323529411764706

Even though I'm in decent shape, this still delivered a tough 20 minute workout.  I definitely broke a sweat and felt like I'd worked out.  I am totally glad I bought this.",1381881600,3,438,4.425

3319056,5,B00127RAJY,Before doing this workout I was going to the gym 5-6x a week doing 40 minutes of cardio.  I found it difficult and time consuming to incorporate strength training.  This video is great.  It takes a little over 20 minutes so you can squeeze it in before or after work.  I now go to the gym 4x week and do 30 minutes of cardio & this video 4x week. I think it is great to combine the two.  There is little cardio in the video so I recommend supplementing it on the side.  After a few weeks I've already noticed my arms are stronger.  You should definitely give it a try.,1381536000,,568,4.063063063063063

JM30DS has kept me accountable, pushed me to my limits, and help me to lose 10 lbs so far! She's awesome!

Love that there are three circuits with three parts each, so you always know how much you have left before the end of the workout.  HATE that you can't fast forward through her little intro speech.  Only need to hear that once!  Wish it had one more workout like Ripped in 30.  Wish it had three strength moves per strength circuit instead of one long one (one minute) and one short one (30 seconds).  For these reasons, Ripped in 30 is the better choice overall, but I like owning both for variety.  These workouts really shaped my upper arms and back noticeably.",1381104000,4,635,4.566371681415929

However, this one offers a calmer less in-your-face Jillian which I found much more to my taste.

3319092,4,B00127RAJY,"Before buying the video (or any video) I read the reviews.  I am in my mid 60's and like a good workout.  Because of my age I'm very cautious about doing anything that will injure me.  I have Jillian's No More Trouble Zone workout and I love it so I'm very familiar with the moves in these 20 minute workouts but at a much faster pace.  However, what I will not do is follow the advanced moves as I know my limitations.  I would agree if you have bad knees or any other medical condition to avoid these workouts.  So, as long as I can do these without injury I will be doing so.

So far I've done #1 and #2 so I will do these until I feel comfortable to move on (or maybe not).  I really like Jillian's method of teaching and I love her exercises.  I'm working to get my last 10 pounds off and hope to have that complete by the end of the year.  With these exercises and eating right I'm sure I'll get to my objective.

Update:  I did Workout #3 and I was panting.  I would never attempt to do some of these jumping moves even if I were younger.  I can definitely see why people got knee injuries if they attempted to do this.  Definitely just use common sense and do not attempt to do things you don't feel comfortable with.  You can get a good workout without doing the more advanced moves - believe me.",1380067200,12,1305,4.078740157480315
3319093,4,B00127RAJY,"I purchased this video in late July and did the workout 6-7 days a week. The first week is when I felt it the most, I was red faced and covered in sweat after every workout. I didn't go to level 2 untill about 11 days because I felt like I was still feeling the burn with level 1.  Once I did got to level 2 I discovered I was not going to get a good work out doing that level for the simple fact that so much of that level is down in either PLANK Position or Push UP Position and my wrist could not handle it at all. They would start burning or they would ache the next day.  So what happened, ..well I did my best to get through level 2 a few times then ultimately  I reverted back to level one with heavier weights. I also tried level 3. Level 3 is just ok, but again with the wrist. I basicly did level 1 for a little over a month with a handful of days trying level 2 or 3. My legs are pretty fatty so I deffinetly didn't get Shredded LOL. Even though I didn't  loose numbers on the scale I started to see a little deffinition peak through on nyquads and my chest and arms looked alot slimmer.  What I LOVE is that 20 mins is a Very Doable workout and after I got through week one all the other workouts flew by. I haven't used it in about 2 1/2 weeks but will be starting level 1 again and trying to find a good SHORT cardio video to add to my routine.",1379894400,,1358,3.8530465949820787

3319096,5,B00127RAJY,"Ill get down to the important stuff first. Just starting to say i had my second baby 10months ago and i needed some sort of weight loss boost!
I didn't weigh myself, because i feel like when i do, i just tend to concentrate on a number.so i don't exactly know how much i lost. I did measure myself though and i lost:
 5inches around my hips
 2inches from my waist
 just over 1inch around my arms.
1inch around my thighs (although they look a lot smaller so im wondering if i measured wrong initially) , i also lost around my calves and upper body but i did not measure these.

I've done jillian michaels work outs before, but ive never been able to stick to them, because ive felt so spent afterwards (not the good endorphin rush if that makes sense). So i was intrigued by the 30day aspect, and the- fact that it was a 20min workout -30 if you count warm up and cool down.
I found Level 1 was already on youtube for free. So i decided to give it a go.

My goal was to do the 30 days without a rest day. For extra motivation throughout the process, i kept looking for positive reviews online and on youtube (they really did help!).
During the shred, i did end up catching a cold and get the usual aches and pains, but some days i did just push through and do the work out anyway. I think i stuck the rule of if you're ill from the neck up, its fine, but neck down, take a rest. In all i had about 6 rest days (not all at once, but here and tehre).

I have to say, i really enjoyed the whole process. It spurred me on when i started seeing the results! I would say I could see a visual difference on the third day, but started seeing a measurement difference on about day 9 i think, although it could've been sooner.

Eating wise, i did eat healthy, but i didn't deprive myself. So if i was in the mood for something sweet, id have a hot chocolate, or sometimes when i was in the mood id have a pastry! If i was out and my family were having fast food, id just have a medium fries instead of a whole meal, or i just would give it a miss!
I did swaps too, so for me, instead of eating chocolate i found that medjool dates hit that sweet craving for me.(my major weakness and a personal choice to cut it out completely. Ive never found eating chocolate to make me gain weight. But I found that if i didn't eat it, i would get a headache, so i wanted that gone.)
I still do swaps and im trying to make lifestyle changes, so i don't do ""cheat days"". I have a little bit of what i want when i want. But i don't exaggerate! This seems to be working for me, so im pleased!
There is an eating plan to go with this, but i didn't find out about it till the last level of the shred, so i juts did my own eating plan. The eating plan is free online. I think it says ripped in 30, but it still applies to the 30day shred. It looks like a good eating plan too.

I loved the first level, i found jillian to be supportive and encouraging, but in the second and thrid, i found her to be really irritating and cocky! lol. BUt that is just me. I saw a lot of reviewers say that the thrid level is killer, i actually found it to be more enjoyable than the second. I did not like level 2, but i think that is because im not keen on upper body moves.

I've decided im going to start over doing the shred again, because i enjoyed the process so much! I'm very pleased with the results.

I will add that around day 10 my knees did start to hurt, so instead of stopping, i just adjusted certain parts of the workout to accommodate, and then my the end of the second level, the pain had gone away. My thinking was that the joints are hurting because of lack of work out (for me anyway), so tehy're getting used to movement. I'm glad i persevered. I just tried to listen to my body and not push or punish my body.
I always followed the beginner workouts and sometimes i would try and do the advanced.

Now ive started doing a work out that is a bit different. It's called Ballet Beautiful, wich aims to give you longer, lean , toned look...which is what im aiming for. I'm doing the ballet beautiful 5days a week and doing the 30shred every other day.
I'm so glad i did the 30day shred, it's kick started my weight loss and even though i still have a way to go, im so pleased with the results it gives for just 20mins a day.
If you ever find yourself not wanting to do it, just tell yourself 20MINS A DAY! The only work outs you regret doing are the ones you don't do! Give yourself reasons to just do it, instead of excuses as to not!

Level 1 i did on youtube for free and bought the other two levels on amazon! :)",1379894400,12,4588,4.0241492864983535
3319097,5,B00127RAJY,"My background:  I consider myself to be generally fit.  I have worked out pretty consistently for over ten years, but my workout styles have not been consistent.  I like to change things up, both for my body and my mind because I tend to get bored with the same thing over time.  I have been lifting weights for nearly that entire time.  I have run three half marathons and done at least dozen sprint triathlons (five this summer).  I think this DVD is great for anyone at any fitness level.

What you need:  A yoga mat and three or five pound weights.  Not to sound snobby, but I didn't own anything less than 10 pounds before I got this.  I am so glad I read the recommendation on someone else' review!  They recommended three-pound weights for beginners and five-pound weights for people accustomed to training with weights.  I got both because I found that a couple of the exercises are too hard for me with the five-pounders, particularly in the shoulders.

Level One:  I found this to be very moderate.  It was mostly easy, save two exercises, which forced me to bump it to moderate :)

Level Two:  This is a big step but worth it.  At first, I found this level to be HARD.  I couldn't keep up the whole time like level one, and I was pouring sweat!  After a bit more, I can keep up better, but I still find it challenging!  I use mostly the five pound weights, saving the three pound weights for the last weight section only.

I haven't made it to level three yet, but I am looking forward to getting my butt kicked!",1379808000,,1523,4.345195729537367

You can also make your own weights at home if you don't already have them. Just fill 2 700ml water bottles up and bam! Instant 1lb weights. If you want heavier ones, you can buy purified water jugs at cvs or target and use those for your rows and presses. Modify your diet, by cutting the extras, (Starbucks, Jamba juice, soda, salt, fast food, snacks) and eat fruits and veggies. Also, SUPER IMPORTAANT to make your workout the first thing that you do so that you're burning fat stores and not food that you consume for breakfast!!!

The squats and lunges are hard on the knees, so make sure you follow Jillian's proper technique.  It won't hurt the knees then.  And I put a pillow under my knees for the push ups, because that was a little hard on my knees at this point.

3319120,5,B00127RAJY,"When I began doing the 30 Day Shred I had been working out regularly (5 days a week) doing some running and weights.  After losing a substantial amount of weight I felt I needed something that would push me harder.  My wife recommended the 30 Day Shred and I being a guy joked that I wasn't trying to look like Jillian Michaels, and expressed my somewhat serious concern that the workout wouldn't be difficult enough for me.  Wow was I wrong!  Each level is a 20 minute, fast paced workout that left me dripping sweat.  The first three days of each level were the most difficult, but you never get used to the workouts (at least I didn't).  The workouts never really get ""easy"" you just realize you can complete the circuits without taking extra breathers.  About midway through the 30 days I did start to develop some knee pain like other reviewers have mentioned, but it was a dull pain that only accompanied a few of the exercises that I felt I could work through and endure during the day with a few Ibprofen.  I completed the 30 Day Shred about a week and a half ago and lost a total of 13 lbs.  I was very pleased with the results and feel my runs are much easier now.  I liked the workouts so much that I am planning on incorporating the exercises and circuits into my long term workout routine.  I will say that I have a hard time watching exercise DVDs because they can be kinda cheesy and annoying and at times this one is no different.  What I did was I watched the DVD a couple of times and wrote down the exercises, and then did them using a stop watch to keep time while watching one of my favorite TV shows.  I would highly recommend this DVD to people who are starting to get in shape and looking for a challenge.",1378252800,,1729,4.266871165644171

3319122,5,B00127RAJY,"I have owned several workout videos that weren't very effective, but this one will challenge you and start showing results within a week or so of daily use. Her formula of strength followed by brief, high-intensity cardio tires your arms and core, and leaves you sweaty right away. Following others' comments, I mixed it up -- occasionally alternating levels 1,2,& 3 according to whim instead of doing 10 days at Level 1 before moving up. Only parts of Level 3 are harder than 1 or 2, but not all. The variation keeps things from getting too stale.",1378166400,,548,4.65979381443299
3319123,4,B00127RAJY,"First up, it will work for most people - regardless of gender/age etc. That's the good news. Personally, I lost 4 pounds over the 30 days, but I was combining this with other exercise plans to do an hour a day for five out of seven days/week. I'm not convinced weight is the best metric, but it also helped shift inches so the impact on the critical body fat percentage is also good. On top of the fact that it will work, it's pretty easy to fit into your day - you only need 30 minutes or so, including warm up and cool down. That's not unmanageable. Her concept is three minutes of strength, two minutes of aerobic, one minute of core three times. So psychologically you always know where you are and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. She offers three different workouts (she likes the number three) with the implication that you do each for ten days before moving onto the next. They do get progressively more challenging so at least the first time through, that's the way to do it as you need to build up a bit to the next level. Even for the moderately active, it's a challenging workout - and level 3 in particular is an excellent workout.

What you will need are some hand weights (light is fine), ideally a good mat (esp for level 3) - thick if you have dodgy knees and possibly pushup stands if you have weak wrists as she does like to have you in plank a lot. One of the backing bouncers does a slightly lower impact version, but the differences are modest.

So there are a lot of positives. There are also some negatives though. Some won't apply to everyone. If you respond best to shouty coaches, you are in luck here. She does shout and generally seems rather angry. The soundtrack is awful so after you get familiar with the routine, it's best to pump up your own music (you cannot turn the music off unfortunately) which also has the advantage of drowning out shouty Jillian for me. She also fails to understand that we can only hear her and not her two friends so laughs maniacally when they say something apparently funny - hashtag awkward, as some would say. Most irritatingly, every time you fire up the DVD you have to listen to her self-promotion for several minutes before you get to the main workout menu. That's fine the first couple of times. Thereafter, it is infuriating.

Her strength work is potentially the most challenging. She likes to work upper body while keeping the lower body engaged in stress positions. This makes it particularly sensitive to the weight you are lifting - I struggled at first because I was lifting the same weights I would normally lift for these moves but because you are in a stress position you need to go a bit lighter. Thus lighter weights are probably better and will allow you to keep better form. This is another minor gripe - she and her backing bouncers use one set of weights throughout but I found that the different exercises required different weights to be effective. This approach has another longer term issue. It is good for aerobic workout (ie you will lose calories), less good at building lean muscle, because you are forced to use lighter weights. This means that longer term you are not building the muscle to keep fat off (muscle raises metabolism even at rest) so you will have to keep coming back to something like 30 day shred. It also seems strangely biased towards shoulders in the first two levels - maybe it improves posture so makes the impact look better?

Also be aware that level 3 in particular involves a fair bit of plyo (ie jumping up and down) work so City-dwellers / dorm room fitness fans beware - if you have people living below you they might get a little put out. Although by this stage you should be able to out run them if the get really angry ;)

Although short, after 10 days each level becomes so dull. As I said earlier, the first time through, you sort of have to build up to the next level. Thereafter, if you are doing the full 30 days, I'd strongly suggest doing level 1, level 2, level 3 and repeat rather than ten times level 1 etc. Better yet, combine it with other workouts to keep your body from getting used to the routine. If this is the only routine you do, you will soon get bored and the danger is this will stop you exercising. But as a 30 day before you go on holiday routine - it will produce results for a modest time input if you eat sensibly as well. Jillian bangs on about the diet - with reason - but there is no specific food plan associated with this DVD - but for this price, no complaints about that.",1378166400,4,4543,4.384341637010676

3319126,5,B00127RAJY,"There is simply nothing negative to say about this DVD.  There are a lot of dieting/exercise plans that you can invest in (and some that I fell for) that promise quick results (after you spend a pretty penny), but they're not very sustainable.  I love that for under $10 (plus another $15 for some 5lb hand weights) I found something that I enjoy, is sustainable, and inexpensive.  I just finished my 14th day (nonstop) on this DVD.  Prior to this, I was running (something I HATE to do) to try to lose some weight.  I'm 5'1"" and couldn't bring myself under 150 (I really should be closer to 115 for my height).  I had a gym membership, went to classes, spent money on B12 injections and saw a weight loss doctor (long story short... a hack who insisted that I needed to starve myself).  Money I'll never get back.  It was frustrating to feel like that money, time, and effort were for naught.  There was no change in the scale and no change in my body.

Two weeks ago, I bought 30 Day Shred.  I've lost about 4 lbs (I think... the water weight flux is always confusing), but even without a single pound of weight loss considered, I've DRASTICALLY changed the way I look in the mirror.  My once-painfully tight clothing (I refused to shop for more fat clothes, part of my self-motivation), is now loose.  I can wear clothes that were shoved into the back of the closet more than a year ago.  Let me tell you, I'm PANTING during this workout.  I've never had more than a little bit of sweat beading on my face and chest.  I'm dripping sweat by the end of the workout and I usually wait about a half an hour for my body to cool down before showering (otherwise, I'll get out of the shower and still be sweating while I'm getting dressed-- eww.)

What I love, is that yes, it's really hard, but it's also only 20 minutes.  By the time your brain and your muscles are telling you they can't handle it anymore, you're on your last set... and you can't let yourself stop when you can see the finish line.  I've really surprised myself and I can honestly say that I'm very proud of my results so far.  I can't wait to see where I'll be in another two weeks.

I plan on buying the Ripped in 30 DVD after I finish the 30 Day Shred.  This is going to be my new 'go to' daily workout.  This is part of my routine now.  I allow myself some treats once in a while, but my primary food source comes from leafy greans and lean protein.  I'm saving money by buying less processed foods, and I'm finding that I'm also less tempted by the not-so-healthy options.  It simply doesn't fit with my lifestyle anymore... it's counterproductive to the work I've been doing.",1377907200,36,2648,4.33130081300813

3319132,5,B00127RAJY,"What a workout!  I really loved the first workout best.  Not just because of difficulty, but it included moves that I was very comfortable with.  Once you move up to workouts 2 and 3, they are really intense, but it also includes a lot of movements that were new to me.  After I got a hang of the new movements, 2 and 3 were much more fun because I wasn't always trying to figure out how to correctly do the workout.",1377561600,,416,4.098765432098766
3319133,5,B00127RAJY,I have had this in my Wishlist for quite a while and finally ordered it. I have enjoyed doing Jillian's workout. It is challenging!,1377475200,,131,4.5
3319134,5,B00127RAJY,"This is such a great workout, and such a great video.  Jillian is demanding, but also very encouraging.  She believes in you and, after her program, you will believe in yourself.  I have so many workout DVDs at home, my husband laughed at me when I ordered this.  He asked ""What makes this one different from all the others you never used?""  The answer, it works!  And, it's a 20 minute workout.  Everyone has 20 extra minutes a day, I don't care who you are.  I have 2 toddlers, work full time, I do everything around our home by myself because my husband is traveling 80% of the time for work, and I still can find the 25 minutes it takes to do this video everyday.  Great price, great video!  Order it, you won't be sorry!",1377475200,,725,4.264705882352941
3319135,5,B00127RAJY,"Ok, I will be honest I am NOT a cardio workout fan, in fact, I look for every opportunity to avoid it.  I have been going to the local high school and climbing stairs or doing fast pace walking about five times a week for several months, and I finally decided it was time to incorporate something more.  I bought this based on the great reviews and I am SO happy I did.  I am on day six now, and still working on Level 1.  The first day I couldn't finish the entire sets and had to take short breaks.. YES YOU WILL SWEAT.  My endurance has increased just in the first week, now I can complete all of level 1, even doing some of the full (not modified) versions of the sets.  I am going to start the next level tomorrow.  I am so excited to have found something that fits into my routine, does exactly what it is supposed to-- I feel better every day.  I would suggest this workout to anyone!",1377475200,,891,4.080459770114943

3319138,5,B00127RAJY,"Buy this!! I love it! It is hard, there is a lot of jumping on getting on the floor. Something I can't do it but I try my best. I had a stroke a few years ago. Some of the thing in the dvd, my physical therapist have had me do before. Doing this workout, my balance is so much better, I'm getting so strong, and I'm losing weight. I have only had it for three weeks!!! I wish I could give Jillian a hug and thank her. I'm telling everyone about this dvd!",1377302400,,454,3.8404255319148937

3319141,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels doesn't make things easy for you - ever.  This is a great workout, but definitely not for fitness beginners (which I am).  I just do what I can, but it is getting easier as time goes on.  Great video.",1377129600,,217,4.2439024390243905
3319142,5,B00127RAJY,This has been a great way for me to workout everyday and it doesn't interfere with my regular daily life. Only a 20 minute workout is just perfect and a effective way to see results fast and not get bored with the routine!! Loving it!!,1377043200,,235,4.2444444444444445
3319143,5,B00127RAJY,"So I was completely unsure about Jillian and this whole system. Not to mention I had never excersised for more than a week in my life.. I tried it on YouTube first and liked it, so bought the dvd. It works, it's simple, I'm sweaty. Definitely encourage people to get it!",1376956800,,270,4.313725490196078
3319144,4,B00127RAJY,Whew! This dvd will kick your ass! It's all about dedication and motivation. YOU have to be the one to get up everyday (muscles aching) and whoop your own ass though. I'd recommend it to anyone.,1376956800,,194,4.416666666666667
3319145,5,B00127RAJY,"I have been trying to loose weight for a while, and had hit a plateau.  I purchased the 30 Day Shred, to up my exercise.  The first time I did it I thought I was going to die...but I made it through. I had rotator cuff surgery 5 months ago, so some of the exercises are a bit too much yet, but I do the best I can.  As I kept doing it, I found it easier, yet still challenging.  It is taking me more than 30 days to get to level 3, but I don't mind.  The work outs go really quick too.  I have lost another 10lbs in one month thanks to this video, and more are sure to come off as I keep going.  Also my endurance has greatly improved ( i can actually go running without dying), I am also getting more toned (no more flabby arms and abs!!).  This workout is perfect for people that are busy and cannot sit at the gym for an hour or more everyday, but still want a good workout  It will leave you sweating and panting, but I cannot argue with the results.  Just keep pushing yourself.  If I can do this video you can! :-)  Thanks so much Jillian for making this video..I cant remember ever feeling this good. :-)",1376956800,,1111,3.954954954954955

3319147,4,B00127RAJY,I sure am glad this is only 20 min. Its an intense full body workout.  Just when I'm ready to give up and pass out the workout is over. Looking fwd to results in 30 days.  Best money spent for a fitness item. Recommended to beginners.,1376784000,,234,4.065217391304348
3319148,5,B00127RAJY,"First off, I'm a little biased, as I love Jillian Michaels' style. She's definitely nothing like the peppy traditional fitness gurus out there. Personally, I always hated the happy, smiling jerks telling me ""you can do it!"" while I sweated my butt off.

That being said, this workout is pretty tough. I've been on level 1 for about 3 weeks - yes, you're supposed to move after 10 days if you're going to finish in 30, but level 1 is enough for me at this point.

The best thing about this workout is the fact that its broken into 3 circuits. By the time I feel like I'm dying, I realize that I'm already almost done with circuit 2 and I only have one left - which helps tremendously.

The one drawback is that the stretching segment at the end isn't as long or helpful as others I've done, but I don't mind doing my own stretching after the video.",1376784000,,847,4.28125

I mean I actually have some muscle tone.  I have been eating a healthy diet and have also lost a few pounds.  Jillian talks a lot, and the music gets repetitive, but Its the workout I'm there for, so sometimes I just turn down the TV and crank the radio.",1376697600,,393,3.9367088607594938

3319152,5,B00127RAJY,"30 Day Shred is a really good program for beginners or those who still want to get in a goo workout, but don't have an hour to commit! The videos are 20-30 minutes long, go from Levels 1, 2, and then 3 (so it gets more challenging as it goes along), and she uses a circuit method of strength, cardio, and ab exercises. I worked up just as much of a sweat with these 30 min videos as I did with hour long videos in the P90X program. There will definitely be workouts you hate, but you feel great at the end (and there are modified examples of exercises for beginners, so any level could do this).",1376697600,,595,4.094017094017094

3319163,1,B00127RAJY,"I like Jillian. I bought almost all of her dvd's in the hopes of starting to loose 30 lbs that I need to get off of my body. I am in my later 20's and a vegetarian who tries really hard to eat and drink healthfully. I get outside everyday, but really need to loose some weight.

This did not work, no matter how bad I wanted it too.

I started this in May and started right away, with a free online trial of her diet plan to help with this I was onboard and using her DVD's M-F with the weekend filled with out door activity. I was keeping track of my work outs, activities and food. I just gave up after only loosing 8 pounds, no where near the 30 I thought I would be on my way to loosing. Even at 2 pounds a week I should have lost more and I gave up with complete disappointment.

So I loved the video and it was easy to follow. Jillian has a great body and that inspired my, she is a great teacher and the video was not bad at all. I liked that it was mixed up in her 3-2-1 set up and really had high hopes. But for me it didn't work at all.",1376352000,3,1046,3.7889908256880735

I however made it through the first half, took a break, and never went back. I think it's still sitting on top of my dvd player 4 months later... but for anyone who isn't as lazy as me, this would probably be a really good work out!

It is a quick workout taking 30mins including warm up and cool down and works all parts of your body.  It is split up into circuits containing working on strength, core, and cardio. It also has 3 different levels of intensity and the two assistants focus on making the level easier or more challenging. If you don't like dvds that talk at you, there is an audio option to have music only and no voice, though I recommend you wait until you are familiar with the workout before turning the audio off.",1376179200,,625,4.288135593220339
3319172,4,B00127RAJY,"I love Jillian Michael's body, and being obese in my 20s, I wanted it. I have not worked out in a very, very long time, and I started with level 1 with 2.5 pound weights. I was able to do 2 days in a row with the weights but on the third day, I was so sore I had trouble getting down my stairs and even lowering myself to sit on the toilet. I felt terrible that I was so sore after level 1, it made me feel so pathetic. I had to take a 2 day break to give my muscles some time to heal - pretty sure I tore some of my leg muscles with the strength exercises. Today is day 5, and so far I've done the DVD 3 times. I decided to modify 2 of the exercises - the static lunge with a bicep curl, and the side lunge with anterior raise. Today I decided to do those 2 without weights; I still felt like I was getting a workout. Tomorrow I plan to use weights with one of the repetitions, she has you do those moves two or three times I think. I don't think I'll be ready to move to level 2 for a while, I want to be totally comfortable with level 1 first. I would advise anyone who is having a hard time with level 1 to try some of the exercises without weights. It's still effective in my opinion but not so damaging to my weak muscles. You do have to push yourself but, tearing muscles is no fun. Overall I love this DVD and I love that it's only 20 minutes. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1376092800,2,1379,3.825174825174825
3319173,5,B00127RAJY,I started using this video in June and decided to work-out Monday through Friday every week. I started on Level 1 which was hard - but not anything I couldn't do. I was a little sore the first few days but nothing awful. I did Level 1 for 11 workouts then moved to Level 2. It was more challenging and I found that after 11 workouts at this level I was definitely ready to move on to Level 3. I absolutely LOVE Level 3! It is very challenging but I can tell that I am definitely getting much stronger in my upper body. I can do actual full-blown push-ups now! Never before in my life have I been able to do that! (And I am 47 yrs old!) I also noticed that the muscle I had been losing in my quads - was now returning. I feel so much more toned and stronger than I ever have. Thanks Jillian for a great workout!

3319181,4,B00127RAJY,"I am a freshman (soon to be sophomore) in college and had gained about five pounds since starting freshman year. Sure, I hadn't gained the ""Freshman 15"", but I really was not happy with the way I looked at the end of freshman year. So, I hopped onto Amazon and looked at Jillian Michael's DVDs. First, let me just say that Amazon offers an amazing price for a bundle of 3 Jillian Michael's workout DVD's. I purchased the 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and 6 Week 6-Pack for about $25 and free shipping-you can't beat that! As soon as I got home for the summer, I began with the 30 Day Shred. The first day was KILLER. I hadn't worked out all year and that very first workout made me so sick. But then, I began to ease into exercising again and was okay. 30 Day Shred consists of 3 levels, each to be done for 10 days. I like this concept, but then again, after 10 days, each level began to get really boring. I practically had each level memorized by the end of each of the ten days. But, I stuck with it. I weighed myself at the end of each of the ten days, but I didn't see a huge change, which disappointed me. I saw so many success stories on Amazon's review section of the 30 Day Shred. In fact, instead of losing any weight, I gained some! But I soon figured out that I was gaining muscle, not fat. I love that Jillian works in strength moves-it made me a lot stronger. At the end of the 30 Day Shred, I had only lost about three pounds. However, I was a lot stronger and my endurance was so much better than it was when I first started. All in all, this workout DVD is great for those of us who fell off the exercising bandwagon, but want to get back on.",1375833600,,1658,4.073394495412844
3319182,5,B00127RAJY,"I've been jogging two miles, five days a week for three months now. I was starting to get a bit bored with my routine and worse, I noticed that my weight loss was reaching a plateau. I wanted to add an additional exercise routine, both to spice things up a bit and to re-fuel my weight loss (I'm 5'2"", and currently around 142 lbs; my goal weight 125-130 lbs). I was honestly more than a little skeptical about buying a work-out video from Ms. Michaels, primarily because I so loath reality TV weight loss shows (I'm sure you know the one I mean). But I decided to give these particular videos a try because you can buy one at a time. I figured I'd start with Level 1, and if I hated it, I'd only be out $1.99.

Level 1 definitely got my heart rate up, and I was a bit sore the next morning, but I didn't feel like I had worked as hard as I would have liked, so I bought Level 2 to try. First, let me say there is a pretty substantial jump from Level 1 to Level 2. That being said, it was a great work out, and was actually really fun. Jillian is, for me at least, the ideal trainer: she pushes you but is also supportive (without getting sappy and touchy-feely, which I find patronizing). She's good-natured and isn't above joking around and having a good time during the work out, but she's tough too. Basically, because she doesn't give you any outs to give up during the work out, she's saying that she believes you have it in you to finish, and I love that.

This dvd is so motivational. Jillian truly surprised and inspired me. There was no yelling just consistent encouragement. For health reasons I was not able to do this workout every day. Even so, I felt I still got muscular and weight loss results. This workout gets me up and moving. Though each new round I would feel sore the first three days or so after that my body did well.

3319195,4,B00127RAJY,"i need to get back into fighting shape so i took out this DVD last night to get things started.

boy that was a long 20 minutes, at level ONE!

since i've done this before, i put it on mute and use one of my Hotel Costes CDs as a background music.

if you don't like listening to the same talk every time you do it, mute it and use a CD.  it doesn't have to be dance music but there should be a decent consistency (not a super fast song follow by a super slow song type of CD).  imo lounge or club music works best.

jilian's workouts work.  try to do it for 2 weeks to make it a habit.  to get the best result, slowly overhaul your diet, too.  don't cut everything ""bad"" all at once, do it slowly so to trick your body.

more than 1/2 of weight loss is in what you put in your mouth so cut easy carb and refine sugar out and replace with white meat and fresh fruit.

eating right + interval training + time = weight loss + energy + good cardio fitness

I took measurements when i began this workout and every week while using it and I lost a total of 1 inch combined from different areas on my body.  I felt like this workout was a waste of time.

Its just shy of 28 minutes from start to finish on each level. I think this is the first dvd Jillian Michaels put out.

I am on my last week and can noticeably see a difference from when I started. I really like the fact that the workouts are only 20 minutes long.

I think the constant switching between upright and floor movements really helps. It's a butt-kicking workout. You are constantly moving - and before you know it, you're done! Highly recommended - even to those who hate working out. :-)",1373414400,4,486,4.534090909090909

3319249,5,B00127RAJY,"Update as of August 3. I almost finished the 30 day shred, 4 days left. Although I haven't moved up to level 3 yet, I gotta admit: Jillian is simply THE BEST! I can't stop looking at the mirror and checking myself out. I got definition everywhere, my whole body is slimmer, more toned. All my old clothes that I almost threw out now fit perfectly. Men started to pay compliments to me and the way I look. I have more confidence in myself. I am an actress (theatre) and it's very important for me to look great, especially with all those young and skinny girls coming in. Also I am more athletic now, I can jump and run, and I always hated it.
Yes, I ate extremely healthy: mainly organic, whole foods, lots of veggies, no sugar or flower. But I didn't even give up my wine!
I am 41 years old, and I was size 12 for a couple of years, and it was driving me crazy. Now I am back to size 10 and keep shrinking! I look 30 and I feel 30, thanks to Jillian.
To sum it up: If anyone tells you that you can't tone up and lose weight because of age, metabolism, body constitution, genetics or any other stupid excuse - don't listen. Eat right, do Jillian's exercises, and try to get rid of stress as much as possible - and you will be healthy, slim, energetic, happy and beautiful. Guaranteed!

3319254,5,B00127RAJY,"I absolutely love this video! Before this, I used to play tennis or go on the elliptical to ""work out,"" but since I didn't do those on a daily basis, they just weren't enough to build muscle. After reading the reviews, I decided to buy this DVD along with 8lb hand weights. After huffing and puffing and barely crawling through the first level 1 workout, I knew I had to move down to 5lb weights. I'm 20-years-old and fairly fit, but MAN, this workout is HARD! HOWEVER, not stupidly hard enough to do everyday for a little under 30 minutes.

I got my 6' tall, 170 lb gym-rat boyfriend to workout with me one day 'cause he couldn't believe that the workout was that hard. He checked out my weights and told me the 3lb weights fit me a lot better. Afterwards, he was certainly sweating and took back what he said about my workouts being easy. He agreed it was a great cardio workout (but said he needed much heavier weights than 5 lb to build muscle... whatever!).

Some recommendations to make your workout more effective --
1. Get the right weight dumbbells. Go to the store and lift a weight to the side of your body, your arm straight out, and see if you can hold it for 10 seconds.
2. Push ups are hard. Try searching on Google how to get better at push ups. Start at the wall, on a table, or a low couch. Whatever you're most comfortable doing during the workout.
3. Get heavier weights for chest presses! They're super easy and you don't get too much out of them if you don't pump up the weights.

If you're still wondering if you should get this, GET IT! If you stopped and if you're wondering if you should continue with this workout, KEEP GOING! I've been at this for a while now, and my clothes look a lot better on me now! Good luck to everyone!",1373241600,4,1755,4.280120481927711

I couldn't finish level 2 the first few times, so I would alternate levels 1 and 2.  Now, I can complete level 2.  Once I get good at all 3 I will start doing two levels in a row.

The only thing is she talks A LOT. Some times it's awesome and motivational and some times I just wanted her to HUSH and let me work.

I have been using this DVD for 6 days now(just started level 2 yesterday)and I decided that it was the perfect time to write a review.
I have to say that my first day wasn't easy. I was dead with the warm up and I did just half of the work out. The next day (2nd day) my legs were a little sore but even with that ""problem"" I was able to finish the work out and I felt great and really proud. The 3rd day I was really sore and needed a break but I walked for 30 minutes in the morning and 30 at night and went up and down on the stairs few times to keep my body moving. The 4th day I was felling great and did the work out twice ( morning and night), and the days 5 & 6 I started the level 2 and I am doing really good and I am shaking and dead by the end of the exercises because she really kicks your butt. It maybe hard in the beginning for people like me who never did anything like this, but it is easy and Jillian motivates you all the time. She has 2 ladies to help her to show how the exercises should be done. One shows the easy way to do it ( for beginners) and the other one shows the harder way  (advanced). I also got a yoga mat and some weights (You need them to do the exercises). I started with the easy way and I didn't do so well in the beginning but I didn't give up and now I am following the harder way and I am so happy. I have noticed the changes in my body already and you will too. I am doing a diet by eating health in the right times and drinking lots of water and having dinner not later than 6pm . Please eat health so you can see better results. Keep moving! Don't give up! You can do it!",1372464000,3,1634,3.7638483965014577

Days 1-4 of Level one killed me. but after that it got better. The first 2 days of level 2 were really hard too! But I've gotten SO much stronger since Day 1 on L1. It definitely takes effort and is a challenge! I'm currently on day 2 of L3 and I will say that it is easier than L2. I would not suggest weighing regularly while doing this program! If you are not fit when you start you are most definitely going to gain muscle! But muscle kick fat in the rear! It takes up less space and burns 3x as many calories as fat....even when you aren't working out. I suggest tracking progress through measurements and pictures.

Jillian talks you through those moments when you just want to say, ""this is too hard; I give up."" Don't give up. Do what you can and build up more each time. The key is consistency.

One thing I wish she would do, though, is give us a little longer cooldown at the end of Workout 1. Haven't seen the other two workouts yet so I don't know how long the cooldowns are, but I keep moving and stretching for a couple of minutes after Workout 1 ends because I just feel like it stops too quickly after all that intensity.",1372291200,,771,4.099337748344371

I thought it was great that she actually voiced this, coming from the horses mouth, and she acknowledges that her new system workouts are better for getting the results you want. I work out 5 days a week with high intensity and appreciate her honesty. She also recommends to work out 5 days on, 2 days off.

Jillian does not dilly-dally or small talk you to death.  You get to work, you work hard, you're completely done in under 25 minutes.  I saw real results fast, even after baby #4.  I thought it would take me a lot longer to get in shape.  I could not only see my body losing fat and getting more cut, but I also noticed my endurance increasing.

But do it for a week -- however you have to get through it-- and you will see improvement quickly. And this is coming from someone who is 15 lbs overweight and NOT in to exercise!!! Jillian will instruct you to keep moving, no rests, etc., but if you can't do it, just do your best!

The weights was one of the reasons I wanted to use the DVD to strength my bad hand. Weight isn't main goal, but to get healthy. Building muscles is part of that, it takes more then being a skinny minnie. My endurance was improving and you really do see results quickly (if you do it everyday, and eat decent).

I only did one day of day one but was surprisingly sore after even though going through the exercises were pretty doable for me. Day two was a lot more challenging and I plan on sticking with it for a while until I can go through it comfortably enough to move on.

After level one you can move on to level two and then the hardest level: three.

What I did with this was as I built myself up I started doing two of them.  First level one and level two back to back. I hope to be able to do level two and three back to back and then I hope to be able to do all three of them.

You can definitely get ""shredded"" with this workout but I don't think you can do it in 30 days.  Real physical fitness takes longer than that.  However, after 30 days you will definitely have lost weight and feel great about yourself.

It's a really good DVD for the money.

FYI: It does require hand weights and a yoga mat.  You could get by without both but you should at least have a little resistance. Use soup cans if you have nothing else.  Then go out an buy some cheap hand weights (between 1 and 3 pounds should be enough).",1371686400,,1333,3.9660377358490564

There is a LOT of jumping jacks (second week is less, thank goodness) so if you have had kids and, well you know ladies, then be aware, a LOT of jumping! That being said, each time was a bit easier and I appreciate her coaching you along, this is NOT the Jillian from this last season of TBL!",1371686400,,467,4.032258064516129

3319300,5,B00127RAJY,"I consider myself not terribly out of shape but not really in shape either. I got this because I wanted to tone up but not spend a lot of time on it. Jillian gives you a great work out, including a warmup and cool down, inside 30 minutes. There are 3 levels of intensity, and while each workout definitely leaves you feeling like you worked for it, none of the exercises themselves are complex or require skill. Great bang for your buck all the way around",1371600000,,455,4.3023255813953485

I read some of the negative reviews and agree that this workout can be hard on the knees, but I thought that the beginner modifications really helped me keep good form and not injure myself. I definitely could not perform like Natalie! I'm currently staying in Level 2 as I tried 3 and it was way too hard for me to get throughout without repeated breaks. I love this DVD and appreciate whenever a workout routine can be done with minimal necessities, such as one set of weights and not a slew of products I'd have to go out and buy. As someone who has slaved away for hours at the gym, doing endless hours on the stair climber and elliptical with moderate weight training, I found that 20 minutes of her techniques provided far greater improvement and weight loss than I was getting on my own. I will definitely look into additional DVDs.",1371427200,2,1068,4.482051282051282

I can barely walk due to the muscle soreness it's causing, but i'm way more energetic, and I actually look forward to the next workout.  It's not super girly, so my husband will actually do it with me, and I don't feel ridiculous the way i do with aerobics as i am definitely not coordinated. The exercises are tried-and-true basics, such as jumping jacks, crunches, pretend jump rope, and push ups.

I'm on day 6 and I've already noticed an improvement in my stamina. I'm dreading going up to Level 2 because I know it's going to be difficult but I'm looking forward to the challenge. One negative I have for this video is that Jillian Michaels gets really annoying after a while and she's a bit snide at times. I can't really see a huge change yet but I'm only on day 6 and I'm hoping that I see results by day 20. I would recommend this video. Beginners can learn a lot, just pay attention and don't do the moves if you can't do them without being safe.

I haven't truly exercised in about 7 years(back when I was in amazing condition playing soccer and running every day) and since then I've been saying I would get back into exercising but I always use the excuse I don't have time. I just did my first day on the first workout and it was amazing! I'm still getting down from the high of the workout! Pretty much all of the moves are things that I used to do in my strength and conditioning classes but you have to keep up with it and don't let yourself take breaks. By the end I caught myself getting lazy with the moves but hopefully I can stop that!

Definitely wear decent shoes when doing this! Right off the bat I noticed my arches getting a little strained.

All in all I thought this was a fun workout and I hope I can remember to continue doing this so that I can get back to being in great shape!",1370995200,,864,4.136904761904762

I feel amazing after working out to level one, I can't imagine I won't feel the same way after levels 2 and 3.  She explains proper form, and what not to do, which is a good thing - I know I'm doing the exercise correctly the first time, fixing any bad posture or form right away instead of wondering WHY the workout isn't being effective after a month.

Rather than doing the video series for just 30 days, I chose to do each level workout for one month. Workout one equaled sore arms, Jello-y legs and a feeling of accomplishment. I ended up doing the first workout for about 45 days before moving up to workout two.

Once I started doing workout two, I felt like I hit a wall of motivation. I hated the workout. Not that it was so challenging that I couldn't do it- more like I just hated the workout. I found that I was sleeping through my workouts or finding any excuse to do a different workout.

Then I decided to move on to level three. I'm so happy I did. The workout is so much more enjoyable to me. I love waking up in the morning and doing my workout. I see a six pack under a little layer of fluff (though admittedly much smaller layer of fluff than before). I'm much happier with my body now. I have some seriously strong legs and arms... and back... and stomach... and butt. There's really not a part of my body that isn't better toned now.

I have to admit, I did feel the burn from this workout, it was tougher than my hour long routine at the gym in 25 minutes; however not in my abs. Not only that, but I lost no weight, and my stomach actually looked fuller to me.

I am somewhere in the middle. I am not as tone as I would like to be but am in good physical shape and this work out is a work out for me. I love the levels and love switching between them to work different muscles in different ways. If you stick to the work out and don't rest, it is only 20 min after all, you will see results!

Needless to say I don't have much/any weight to loose but It has only been a week and my muscle tone and stamina have improved (Each day I do a different level to keep from burnout/monotony.) I also purchased 6 week six pack (It's no Joke) and No More Trouble Zones, both of which are great to mix in.

If I can do it, anyone can do it.  Jillian keeps it interesting and I like her style.  I've only done the level 1 workout so far and it really kicked my butt.

3319356,4,B00127RAJY,I haven't tried it yet! But saw all the good reviews so ordered it. Will use it this winter for sure!,1369958400,,101,3.857142857142857
3319357,5,B00127RAJY,"When I first started getting serious about getting in shape a few years ago, I did a lot of research about workout DVDs and heard a lot of good things about the 30 Day Shred and, based on word of mouth and the fact that the DVD was pretty cheap, I bought it.  I was vaguely familiar with Jillian Michaels, but had never seen her in action.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into!

Jillian uses a ""3-2-1"" system, meaning 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  The first time I did the level 1 workout I could barely get through it.  I screamed a few choice words at the Jillian on my TV.  The next day, going down stairs was excruciating.  I kept at it, and it got easier.  Never easy, but I gained endurance.  I got stronger.  I started to see results.  I eventually worked up the courage to try level 2 and level 3.  They were hard.  They got easier, but never easy - just the way a workout should be.

I stopped doing the Shred for various reasons and have been doing other workouts over the past couple years, but I recently started doing it again and I found that it is still a terrific workout.  Even though I'm much stronger and in much better shape than I was when I initially started doing this workout, it's still challenging and still gets results.  I can now do level 1 and level 2 back to back!

If you're looking for a workout that is highly effective but doesn't take up a lot of your time, I cannot recommend this highly enough.",1369872000,3,1477,4.162544169611308
3319358,5,B00127RAJY,"Being a fan of Jillian's other workout DVDs (I own ""Ripped in 30"" & ""6 Week Six-Pack"") I thought this would be a good addition to the collection & I couldn't beat the price ($7 on amazon.ca).

The DVD: It works great, no issues there. As always, it has an easy-to-use menu, which I know anyone who uses her DVDs appreciates this, especially when you want to get straight to your workout without any hassle.

The Workouts: I love both all 3 levels, they get the blood flowing & heart rate going. Jillian has you work on different muscle groups than ""Ripped in 30"" & ""6 Week Six-Pack"" it's a nice change of pace. These are tough workouts but it's worth it. I love how positive Jillian is throughout the entire workout as well. I personally like to do Level 1, 2 or 3 from ""30 Day Shred"" & then one from ""6 Week Six-Pack""; the two combined are amazing & sure to get results fast. These workouts will come in handy during the winter when it's dark, raining & snowing because Jillian has you do cardio & strength. In my opinion, I much prefer this to ""Ripped in 30"".

Overall: Highly recommend for fans of Jillian & anyone looking to get toned fast. ""30 Day Shred"" & ""6 Week Six-Pack"" are my favorites!",1369872000,,1197,4.334821428571429

3319367,5,B00127RAJY,"I have tried a couple of different exercise videos by different teachers, but Jillian Michaels is my top choice.
She makes each workout challenging yet not so difficult that you give up. Each interval is short enough so that you don't get bored with the circuits. I also love that almost all moves are easily modifiable and you can add or remove hand-weights.

I wish each workout was a bit longer than 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes would be perfect. Sometimes I even do two videos in one workout, but usually I'm exhausted after completing just one. Level 1 and 2 are both very challenging and are enough to replace a gym session. Personally I think Level 3 is too much for me, but I guess you could modify all the moves to fit your level of fitness.",1369699200,,750,4.434782608695652

Sometimes I get so tired of working out every single day, but it's not too hard to put this in, knowing it's gonna kick my butt, but it'll be over before 30 minutes is up.  I know it says it's a 20-minute workout, but it's got warm-up and cool-down, and a few itsy-bitsy breather breaks, so it ends up being ~26 minutes.  I'm always wiping sweat away before minute 10.  (And I'm in pretty decent shape already!)  There are 3 levels, and you can advance yourself as you feel the need to do so.  There's nothing saying you HAVE to do Level 1 for X days before going to Level 2.  I did Level 1 only 3-4 time before moving to Level 2.  I've been on Level 2 for nearly 2 weeks, and am just about ready to bump it up to Level 3.  This is a great workout, and I think it actually IS responsible for some of the inches I've been losing around my waist and hips.  Excellent!!!

It comes with three different workout levels so you can go at your own pace and switch levels whenever you feel you're  ready for the next challenge. Definitely recommend if you're looking to shred those extra inches but I wouldn't recommend for only 30 days. You should include this workout as an everyday routine.,1369353600,,533,4.494845360824742

Definitely start with level 1. And I recall reading a review complaining about how she doesn't stop to take breaks or drink water. Well, she tells you exactly why she's doing it. I sip water intermittently and keep moving. Another thing is that she's not annoying like a lot of workout video hosts. She's informative, motivating, and knows when a laugh is a bit of a release.

3319401,5,B00127RAJY,"Let me begin by saying this about me: I am in my mid 30's. I am vegan, do not eat any processed foods, nothing that comes in a box, I load up on tons of veggies and fruit, and am in very good shape. I do a lot of yoga and pilates but not too much cardio. I am 5'5 and weigh about 120. I do not weigh myself nor measure myself as a rule but that is approximate. I am a fit, size small. I tell you all of this because I think that when you are reading these reviews and hearing that people are losing weight, that information needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Who are these people, what is their diet, how much did they initially weigh, etc?  If this video is not being done in combination with healthy eating, you are not going to be losing weight and inches. Losing weight should be a conscious decision that should come with other changes in our habits and choices. I started this video after a long vacation in Europe in which I was not exercising too much and eating a lot of delicious food. I was feeling a bit out of sorts and needed a video to bring me back to feeling strong and lean.

All of that being said, I really love these videos and see a big difference in my own body after just 9 days. I am more toned, slim and have more energy. Jillian is great and her format is effective. She is very clear on form and is very encouraging. Video 1 is very do-able and preparers you for the other videos.

****Update
I finished the series. I definitely got smaller and much much more toned. I was not looking to lose weight so I did not have a goal in mind - except to tone a bit. I will say though this: BE CAREFUL with all the ""explosive"" moves. Explosive moves are NOT good for the cartilage, ligaments, joints and soft tissue of your body. Your body is NOT designed  to handle explosive moves repetitively. That is why Athletes and hard core exercise people have multiple injuries. If you want to maintain your body for the longterm- I really suggest that you go light on the jumping. I substituted a lot where there was maximal impact and I still look AMAZING and toned after 30 days. You will not be losing by going light- you will still be burning fat and boosting metabolism, but you will also be protecting the structures of your body and cannot handle impact. IE- Joints! I also felt that a few of the ab exercises were totally unsafe and I substituted ones that were just as effective but caused minimal wear and tear on the discs. I do not recommend anything where you are laying on your back and your legs are straight out ahead hovering on the floor. All you need to do is listen to your body and you might notice that this is an inherently unsafe move. There are plenty of other moves that work better. Check out pilates moves from other videos online and choose the ones that cause you NO pain.

Well, I love her 3-2-1 (Strength - 3 minutes, Cardio - 2 minutes, Abs - 1 minute) program. You can do anything for 3 minutes! I've developed muscles where I hadn't had them before. And my endurance for running is so much better due to the workouts. I haven't started Level 2 yet but I am going to do it soon.",1368230400,,463,4.213483146067416

I've been wanting to tone up and maybe lose 5 or so pounds, everyone says I look great, but I know I'm out of shape. So I bought this DVD and on that first day of level one, it showed just how bad off I was! I was sweating and panting like crazy before the halfway point! My body ached SO bad for the first few days, but it's totally worth it! My body got used to it a bit and I don't feel like someone beat the hell out of me, I just feel GREAT! I just started level 2 today. I'm seeing muscle tone in places I've never seen before!! It's not easy but I find myself more and more proud of myself for pushing myself to get through it. By far the BEST workout I've ever done!! I would for sure reccomend this to anyone looking to tone up and lose weight!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!",1368144000,3,863,3.909090909090909
3319415,5,B00127RAJY,"Even the OUT OF SHAPE can easily perform this routine. I am still on level one, but can go deeper into the moves. I highly encourage this if you want to melt the fat away.  My husband and children are seeing the difference in me and have started doing the workout as well.  The only problem I had was the actual DVD only played a few times before suddenly being unreadable. I didn't want to wait so I purchased workout 1 through amazon instant and can access it where ever I am.  Good luck and now go get your sweat on....",1368144000,,522,4.148514851485149

I hate sweating & she makes you work, but she is right & that if you work hard you will see the results. If you have just decided to start working out, I would give it a few weeks on the treadmill and then slowly work into step 1. The great thing of this video too is its 3 sets of cardio, toning & abs. You keep moving & you will see it. But I warn you, you will sweat!",1367971200,,443,3.625
3319421,3,B00127RAJY,I like this one a lot but I only gave it 3 stars because it really hurts my knees.  I stopped doing it and noticed that my knees don't hurt when I use other low impact workout dvd's - maybe if I lose some more weight I'll pick it back up again but I did really liked that it was only 20 minutes.,1367971200,,295,3.6825396825396823
3319422,5,B00127RAJY,"This is an intense work out in only 20 minutes! There are 3 levels of 20 minute workouts that provide intervals of cardio, strength and abs.  Jillian is extremely motivating as well.  Intervals are a way to really challenge your body.  If you want to get toned and drop a few pounds quickly, get this DVD!  Level 1 is pretty intense, it took me a long time to move up to Level 2!  This is one of my favorite DVDs and I love that you get a full work out in 20 minutes.",1367971200,,467,3.978494623655914

All this is great the first time, but we can't pass this in subsequent viewings?  I guess if I want to continue doing the workout, I'll start the DVD before I get dressed, water, weights and towel.  I just don't want to get all ready and then sit for 3 minutes waiting for the workout to start.",1367798400,,560,4.027027027027027
3319426,4,B00127RAJY,I love that I feel like a get a good work out in about 20 minutes. I only wish Jillian Michaels wasn't in the video as I find her annoying. I am familiar enough with the routine now that I can mute the tv and follow along. This makes the workout much more pleasant.,1367625600,,265,3.925925925925926

It is high impact, and a bit intimidating at first, but once you get started there is no time to tell yourself this is too hard.  You just keep going until she says to stop.  It's like having her there in your own living room!  I certainly can never afford a personal trainer, but with this DVD I don't have to!  Jillian Michaels is a Godsend!",1367625600,2,474,4.211111111111111

Finished and felt very invigorated.  Woke up the next day and could NOT walk.  My thighs felt like 2 huge pieces of bruised meat! Not to mention my aching pecs and arms....Jillian totally kicked my ass in under 30 minutes.  And I love her for it.  I have done it now every day for a week and I can feel the difference in my body.  I will continue to do this for 30 days...and then move onto some other JM videos...this woman knows her physiology.",1367539200,2,555,4.19811320754717
3319429,4,B00127RAJY,I love Jillian Michaels and these workouts are quick but very challenging.  It's a great extra workout I can squeeze in even after hitting the gym early in the day.  I'm up to workout #2 and looking forward to working my way up to #3.,1367539200,,234,4.177777777777778
3319430,5,B00127RAJY,I started seeing the results of my work out after about 2-3 weeks. The great thing about this program is that you can easily do it everyday. There are no excuses to skip your work out if its only 25 minutes long. What I love about these workouts is that all the exercises are combination moves so that you are maximizing your time (working arms and legs at the same time). I also like the fact that you do not need a lot of room or equipment (maybe hand weights) and that's it. NO EXCUSES!,1367539200,3,489,4.157894736842105

3319435,5,B00127RAJY,This is a great workout video. I really saw changes in my endurance and body quickly and Jillian Michaels is really motivational without being too tough. It's also great that there are 3 different levels in just one DVD.,1367366400,,220,4.666666666666667
3319436,5,B00127RAJY,Jillian is to the point and she means what she says in this workout. I was sore for four days before my body began to adapt to these. You work large muscles with small ones to burn more fat this way thus speeding up the changes. Workouts are about 25 min each because of the warm up and cool down. Perfect for those with limited time to work out in a gym. Love it!!!,1367366400,3,366,3.9594594594594597

3319442,5,B00127RAJY,This DVD was rated one of our Most Popular Diets of 2012. Michaels packs a powerful workout into just thirty minutes that contains the core components of any successful workout routine.,1367280000,,185,5.0
3319443,5,B00127RAJY,Jillian Micheal's doesn't play around with this workout. I can already tell I am slimming down after doing this workout for the last 2 weeks. The interval workout is PERFECT with those with limited time and maximum will power to workout.,1367280000,,237,4.804878048780488

3319445,4,B00127RAJY,"I have been doing this DVD for almost a month now. I think it is a good work out and all of the levels offer distinct moves that progressively make the workouts harder. It can be a little hard on the knees with all of the jumping jacks and squats, but as long as you use good form it is doable. I definitely have not lost up to 20 pounds, but I have lost at least 5 and that is without following her diet. I do not follow the diet, because it is only free for a little while and then you have to pay. All in all I am enjoying this DVD and seeing results. I think it offers a solid, quick workout that I will and have been recommending to other people.",1367193600,,651,3.8656716417910446

3319448,5,B00127RAJY,"This was my first Jillian Michaels workout and certainly won't be my last. This is really great workout. I began adding it to my routine five days a week. I didn't really have high expectations since it's only a twenty minute workout. However, by week two, I noticed real results. My arms feel a lot stronger, and Jillian is a great motivator. There are even changes in my core. Going to buy more of her!",1367107200,3,404,4.4
3319449,3,B00127RAJY,"I am pretty sure this is a burned cd, the packaging was different than my friend's who bought hers at the store, but the video works fine in my DVD player, like the work out, short bursts so by the time your ready to give up, it's over",1367107200,,235,3.9166666666666665
3319450,4,B00127RAJY,"When I decided several months ago it was time to get into shape I bought this DVD since I had heard so many great things about it.  It kicked my flabby butt into shape in about a week!  The first day on level 1 I could barely do one push-up and after a week I could do about 20!  I used 7 pound weights because those are what I had and I noticed a big difference in my upper body.  I moved onto levels 2 and 3 (level 3 is crazy and I had to buy 5 pound weights to get through it) and bought some of Jillian's other workouts (No More Trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, 6 Week 6 Pack, and Killer Buns and Thighs).  After trying out her other more dynamic workouts, I have not gone back to Shred.  What I've noticed about Shred as compared to Jillian's other DVDs is that she does many more reps in Shred which can get mentally tedious after awhile (and physically exhausting).  If you are looking for a similar workout with more variety I would recommend Ripped in 30, which uses the same circuit format as Shred but adds another move in the strength portion to break it up a bit. (It also includes 4 workouts instead of 3).

All of Jillian Michaels' DVDs have given me great results beyond what I expected, and I want to speak specifically about the results I have gotten working out with her 5-6 days a week for the past several months. When I started I was not looking to lose weight but to tone and tighten, and I have since gained about 3-4pounds. I was initially surprised by this (I never thought exercise would make me GAIN weight) and occasionally after a workout I feel a bit ""bulky"" the next day. I read that weight training can cause the body to initially retain water but my weight gain has stayed pretty consistent since starting this routine. I wanted to mention this as I have only read reviews describing weight loss and that may not be the case for everyone. Overall I am very pleased with my results and look and feel much healthier and more athletic.

Though I have moved onto her other workouts, Shred was the perfect place for me to start with Jillian and I would highly recommend it to start your fitness routine.",1367020800,2,2128,4.27363184079602
3319451,4,B00127RAJY,"This workout is quite good.  It takes 30 minutes to get through each workout.  I typically like to work out longer, but when I finish this one, I don't feel shortchanged.  A couple of annoying things about the dvd (otherwise I would have given 5 stars):
1.  You have to sit through the intro every time; I haven't found a way to skip or fast-forward to the workout, and it's not exactly a quick intro, either.
2.  She tends to start and finish on the same leg or arm, so one side gets an extra rep.  Maybe it's just me, but I like balance and knowing both sides get the same exact workout.  So, I typically rush an extra rep in before starting the next exercise.",1367020800,,662,4.2063492063492065
3319452,5,B00127RAJY,I would get winded very easy at first but once you get used to it the fatigue passes. Not a huge fan of Jillian but she knows what she is doing.,1367020800,,144,3.6774193548387095
3319453,5,B00127RAJY,"Great for a quick, fat burning workout when pressed for time. I'm a runner and in fairly good shape and this video still challenged me- it felt great!

3319455,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian has made a great workout video in the 30 Day Shred. 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs, repeat 3 times. Breaking it up in this way makes the workout a breeze to accomplish and by the time you're on the second set you're thinking to yourself ""Well I'm almost done anyway so I might as well finish.""

Great for rainy days when I can't run or for the entire winter when I can't bring myself to run in the snow!",1366848000,,440,4.057471264367816

3319461,4,B00127RAJY,"I did the Jillian Michael's DVD this morning.  It's a pretty good workout and it goes by very fast. My arms are KILLING me this morning and I didn't even use weights!  I only have 10lb dumbbells and I need to buy 5lbs this weekend...they use 5lbs in the DVD and I wouldn't use anything more, especially to start.  I feel like I'm going to be very sore later today/tomorrow lol! But over all I think I was able to do 16min of the 20min workout so not too shabby!

I think once I learn the moves better too I'll be able to breeze right through it",1366761600,,544,4.05607476635514

I do not know about the content on the DVD when it plays, because when I put the disk in I kept getting a ""Insert Disk"" message on my screen. I tried it multiple times on my dvd player, and switched between DVDs just to make sure it was the DVD and not my player. AND in the process I accidentally destroyed my FAVORITE work out dvd due to my own anger and took it out too briskly while switching back and forth and broke the disk. But yea really disappointing. Unfortunately I did not read back enough in the reviews, because other people had the same problem as well. So beware, it works on some DVD players and not others, as I gave it to a chick who lives a floor above me and it played fine. If you want a DVD that works on ALL DVD players and not on just a few then this is not the disk for you.",1366675200,,842,3.9011627906976742

Like most of you, i want results  and i want them fast. I felt this on day one and still feel it on day 25.

Then, I thought I would get the Ripped in 30 DVD at the store.  1 day of doing that video my knees were killing me.  I couldn't bend down without feeling like they were going to give out.  I noticed no difference after a week of completing week 2 of that DVD.  I like the way Jillian talks to the viewers in the 30 Day Shred whereas the Ripped in 30 is her smacking her assistants and saying a lot of ""get after it!!!"" which is distracting for me.

So, I'm sticking with the 30 Day Shred - better results and easier on the knees.  I feel like there is more aerobic/movement type exercises rather than planks with jumps like in the other DVD.",1366502400,2,879,4.040462427745664

She has 2 other girls on the DVD with her showing how to do amended moves for beginners and the tougher moves for those more advanced. I have already started shedding some weight.

Also worth nothing is that the DVD cost less than $10. Compared to a gym membership cost, it is a steal.

I would rate it 5 stars except I don't like that every time you turn the DVD on, you need to watch 5-10 minutes of an intro; you cannot fast forward or skip. I've learned to skip back to the beginning and then stop so that its queued up on the following night.",1366156800,,578,4.06140350877193

I don't often bother to do reviews, but I am so pleased with this DVD I wanted to share my experience and encourage anyone who might be on the fence about it that this is an effective workout. I never watched Biggest Loser but was familiar with Jillian Michaels, and bought this figuring she would help whip me into shape. And wow, I am not disappointed. This is a challenging - yet fun and upbeat - workout, with 3 levels. Each workout is about a half hour long (she calls them 20 minute workouts, but there is a warmup and a cool down for each - WHICH I TOTALLY COUNT, thank you very much (!) and make the total time closer to 30 minutes). I am currently on week 3, continuing to rotate all 3 levels (mostly switching back and forth between 2 and 3 at this point) and like them all. Each version has parts that seem relatively easy/do-able, and each has at least one part that seems darn near impossible... at least until after a few more days of trying. The thing that has impressed me the most is the SPEED at which I am seeing improvement. There were exercises (""circuits"") which I could barely do the first time or in the first week... and on day 21 I can tell you, I can do them ALL - even the advanced versions following Natalie. I can really see and feel a difference in my weight, my fitness, and especially my abs. If you buy this DVD, do it every day, and really stick with it (""Don't give up!"" and ""Don't phone this in!"" as Jillian says just at the right times), you WILL see results.",1366070400,2,1511,4.231833910034602

3319559,5,B00127RAJY,"Quick background information: I'm in my mid-30s and have 3 young children. I only had about 5 or so pounds to lose, but I really wanted to tone up. The problem: between family, work and school, the last thing I have time for is to set aside an hour or more to work out consistently. So when I saw that I could do this workout in such a short amount of time, I figured it was worth a shot. I didn't expect much, but by the time I finished Level 1 I was shocked by the results: flatter tummy, firmer butt, and some definition in my arms! Normally, I absolutely HATE working out, and lose interest in my ""exercise of the moment"" but seeing the change happen so quickly with this program has really motivated me to stick with it. I did miss a day here and there, but even with my schedule I am able to be consistent.

I realize that some people may be put off by it, but I love Jillian's ""drill sergeant"" style; I need someone to tell me to push through the pain. It also helps that she has a similar petite frame that I have, so I can kind of envision what I have the potential to achieve.

UPDATE: I moved onto Levels 2 and 3, and I have to say that I didn't enjoy the exercises as much as Level 1 because I found them awkward to do, and very hard on my knees. What I ended up doing was going back to Level 1, but using heavier weights. Then when I got back to Levels 2 and 3, I substituted the painful exercises (like the squat thrusts ad mountain climbers) with more intense versions of Level 1 exercises.",1365984000,,1505,4.081081081081081

3319597,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian is not lying when she says ""this is no joke"". The only thing I was doing when I first finished level 1 was gasping for air and wondering ""why the heck did I decide to start working out again?!?!"" But seriously, as a new younger mother, being 5'9'' and 220 lbs. was devastating for me. I have been quite active my whole life and have an athletic build, but that was masked by baby fat and cellulite. I bought this DVD thinking ""ok, well, the worst that can happen is that I stay the same"". I mean whats 20 minutes anyways? I'm going to be honest here... the first week of the workout was brutal for me. So brutal that I stopped doing it. I didn't think the pain was worth it. A few days later I weighed myself and... I lost 3 lbs...? How was that even possible? Those 3 lbs. gave me the motivation to suck it up and commit to making a serious lifestyle change with Jillian Michaels help. The DVD is only 20 minutes long, but in order to see results you really have to push. Jillian uses her 3-2-1 method (3 minutes stregnth, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs). You repeat the 3-2-1 method twice for each leveled workout (3 intervals total). While doing certain intervals (for me it's the plank jacks and double jump rope in level 2) you really do feel like you cannot go on. If you are determined and disciplined enough and actually give it your all you WILL SEE RESULTS. It's been about two weeks that I have been really serious about this workout and I have definitely noticed a change in my body. I actually go to the gym in the morning to get more cardio in before I do the tape now. Level 1 is easy for me, and I never thought I would say that. I'm still on level 2, but I will be switching to level 3 in another 3 days. The only thing I would change about this DVD is the horrible background music. I wear headphones while working out to the shred now... I couldn't take the elevator music anymore. Even though I can't hear Jillian's voice motivating me, her death stare through the television is enough to keep me going! She really is an inspiration and an amazing trainer! Just know that you can't do a workout DVD and then go eat three cheeseburgers though. You have to eat healthy and clean to see maximum results (as Jillian states in the beginning). This DVD has changed my life! I'm now down to 206 lbs and have more energy than I have had in months! People have told me that i look like i weigh a lot less than i do, and ask me where i find the time to workout so much!! I'm not where I want to be but with Jillian's help I know ill get there! This DVD was/is a steal and I would recommend it to anyone that is serious about losing weight and gaining confidence. Overall I am beyond happy with my purchase.",1365638400,4,2727,4.186311787072244

I was still sore the next day, but I remember thinking back several months how I would pray for the 20 minutes to end. I couldn't have gotten in shape to begin with without this video.

3319634,4,B00127RAJY,"I DID THE 30 DAY SHRED FOR 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS

I decided to try this DVD because I wanted something intense- I had recently gained 25 pounds (from holiday binging and from a 6-week trip back home to the USA -I live abroad-) Yes 25 pounds in about 3 months (after I had lost those 25 pounds and kept them off for 2 years!)
I'm a 5 foot 4ish and started the shred at 172 pounds.

I didn't change my diet too much except for paying attention to portion control, only eating when I was truly hungry, and trying to cut out soda and desserts.
I did the shred everyday, but not at the same time everyday.

The easiest day was day one- why I don't know but maybe because I didn't know what to expect.

The hardest days were days 2-6. I wanted to give up. I didn't see how I'd ever move on to workout 2. I wasn't seeing results. (That said, I don't think it was going to be realistic for me to lose 20 pounds in 30 days! My goal was 20 pounds in 3 months) I took it one day at a time.
I was VERY surprised at how much I enjoyed the shred. Usually, I look for things I can do to great music, like dancing. Before I did this DVD I kept in shape by doing dance (like zumba type or ""Just Dance"". I usually hate aerobic DVD's with the cheap porno-esque music in the background (be forwarned-this DVD has that!) I have pretty much never done weight training in my life! But I sincerely looked forward to this everyday. Something about it- like the counting really appealed to me. Like I just have to get through 2 minutes of cardio until we change activity... it was challenging in a different way. I talked outloud to myself!
What Jillian says during workout 1 is true- if you're around day 6 or 7 you really can feel that your endurance and strength are improving. Your muscles stop aching everyday. Starting around day 12-15 I craved more! I felt so amazing and energetic after the workout (whereas after days 1-7 I felt like curling up in a ball and crying!)
I started out with 2 kilo weights (5 lbs) on day 15ish I felt that on many of the strength training exercises I could go up and use heavier weights.
I sweat a lot and actually liked it. At the end it felt like I had really worked hard.

I moved on slowly. I did do workout 2 once in the beginning and ""regretted"" it as it was for the most part too hard for me, BUT that said, I took the bits and pieces from it that I did like, to mix up work out one.
Some people said- should I do this workout 2x a day? I moved up slowly. The workout is 3 sets of 3 min strength, 2 min cardio, and 1 min abs... around day 10 I started doing 4 sets. On days I felt good I added low impact cardio at another time during the day- walking, or dancing.
I went away for the weekend and was able to keep doing the shred without the DVD in my in-laws basement!!!

Something that helped for me was counting how many reps I was doing (usully in workout 1 it is about 15 for strength and maybe 30 for cardio i.e. 30 jumping jacks or 15 bicep curls) counting how many I had left was easier than trying to watch the clock for 30 seconds or just waiting for Jillian to say 2 more!
After while I was able to shut off Jillian's voice (there is an option for that) and just focus on doing my moves correctly.

On a few days in the beginning I did 'injure' myself- I have a bad knee, and a bad shoulder from years of swimming- so on the days after that I adapted the workout but kept doing it, stayed off the bad knee, or didn't push the shoulder that was hurting, and usually recovered from the pain within a day and was able to continue. It is almost important to stay focused and do all the moves correctly, make sure your feet are grounded because you can easily hurt and ankle.
I also have a herniated disc in my lower back so was very careful to adapt some of the exercises- for example I can't do the lower ab reps that lift the pelvis off the ground so I replace that part with something more low impact for my back that still works my abs.
Because of my back, in workout 2 for example, I pause the DVD and take some of the exercises slower in the beginning to make sure I am doing them correclty and doing controlled movements.

Around day 20 I was flipping through the calendar and saw that I only had about a week left before the end of my goal to do it for 30 consecutive days.... couldn't believe it! Wasn't counting anymore. My muscles are bulging!

30 days now and I'm not stopping!

On the days where I didn't want to turn on the dvd (when I was in the last few days of a level), I had pretty much memorized the dvd so I would do the workout on my own using a timer for all the exercises.

There was no major change to my diet apart from not eating after 6pm.  My results after Level 1 are that I lost 10lb and 11 inches.  I am a 50 year old and have 4 stone to lose, so another 3 stone and 4lb to go.  I started Level 2 on 26th March 2013 for a few days and realised I'm not at that level of fitness yet, so I've gone back to Level 1 and this is my 13th day!!!  My weight and inch loss may be down to the fact that I have a lot still left to lose but I also see my level of fitness has increased and I have muscle tone and strength.

3319639,4,B00127RAJY,"After years of going to the gym and slaving on the elliptical or bike for an hour at a time and not seeing any impressive results or improvements in fitness, I'm a complete convert to the short but intense workout! Like Jillian says, if you want a short workout, you don't get to take breaks. But I'd rather spend 25 minutes a day

Pros:
This is a great DVD because it's affordable, has three levels and requires very little equipment (just hand weights and a mat if your floor isn't carpeted). Jillian uses compound moves (exercising multiple muscle groups at one time) so you see overall improvement in less time. She also uses circuits of strength, cardio and abs to keep things interesting.

Cons:
I started this with the intention of doing it for 30 days, but by the fourth day of Level 1, I found I was getting bored of the routine. Suggestions to get around this is to switch up the three levels (following the modifications for harder levels) or integrating other DVDs by Jillian or others into your routine.

Overall though I recommend this to anyone, from beginners to regular exercisers. Jillian is tough but encouraging and the routines are challenging but doable!",1365379200,,1176,4.699029126213592
3319640,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout. It's not long and if you can muscle through the 24 minutes of it, you'll certainly feel it the next day. There are different stages to take you through the 30 day period so you don't get too bored. It is not an easy workout at all. As Jillian says, you can't take it easy and expect results from a 24 minute DVD!",1365379200,,337,3.9705882352941178
3319641,4,B00127RAJY,"This is my second Jillian DVD and I echo other reviews regarding the intensity of the workout in a 20 minute window - it is great.  I have never had knee problems and these workouts are very hard on the knees.  Even being careful with form, something went 'pop' doing simple jumping jacks a few days in!  Am sure the knee was stressed from unusual activity...

Also, silly note, but:  This DVD has a menu at the beginning.  Our DVD player remote is long gone so I could not navigate to play the workout....ended up watching it in YouTube.",1365379200,,538,4.383838383838384
3319662,5,B00127RAJY,"Absolutely loving this workout program.  This is the first Jillian Michaels workout video I have purchased and actually used or haven't quit because of boredom in a few days.  I am currently finishing up level 2 today (so I haven't even looked at level 3 yet) but I already have lost 3 to 4 inches and my muscle tone is really starting to gain some sculpted aspects.  I will say I am quite tall and lean for a female to begin with at 5'11"" and around 150 pounds.  (I purposely haven't kept track of my weight for this program, since weight isn't what matters to me).  I have always been athletic and athletically built throughout my entire life, but with a full time career and classes the last 4 to 5 years, I haven't had time to keep up with my physical activity at all.  Since I haven't been active for awhile, the first  3 days were rough, but after that your endurance really starts to pick up.  I also kept with  a 5 days a week workout schedule for this.  I still have two days of the week I CANNOT fit a workout into.

After just level one and level two on that schedule there was a huge difference in my waist, hips and belly.  My belly (while not gnarly ripped) is completely smoothed down and I no longer have that little pudge at the bottom of my abs.  I even actually have some side obliques that are starting to show some definition.  (Never had those before!)  My little muffin top is also completely smoothed out along my waist and hips.  I literally think I may need to go down a size already.  I can also tell quite a huge difference in my back tightening up and not showing those ""bra lines"" from gaining a few pounds.  I even have some lightly defined biceps and triceps developing again!  However I will say I don't see as drastic changes in my legs or rear end.  I can tell they are much stronger and tighter though.

Overall, I feel better, I look better, clothes are fitting better and I just feel energized each morning to start my day after this workout.  Jillian isn't annoying or overly overbearing.  She is motivating with out saying the same thing over, however by day 10 your look forward to a different routine and new narration!  This is a workout routine where I have heard a few individuals say they did not get any results and I don't believe they really, REALLY, tried to keep things challenging.  If you are following along with the hard level backup guide or Jillian it truly is a quick decently hard workout.  I don't see how you couldn't get results by the end, if you even try half way.",1365379200,,2528,4.336886993603412

3319664,5,B00127RAJY,"The DVD has 3 (30min) workouts.

I like doing 2 or 3 wourkouts at once. Doing only one workout is not enough for me. I like spending 60min during a workout.

I like the DVD menu. For example, if you finish level 1, you can go to level 2, and the dvd menu allows you to skip the warm up and go straight to the workout. That is a good feature for those trying to do more than one routine.

Her 3-2-1 makes the workout go really fast.",1365379200,,431,3.875

3319667,5,B00127RAJY,"I now have most of her workout videos. They are exceptional. I hate the gym and could never be consistent or excited about working out until these videos. She is sharp, funny, times her encouragement correctly, but most importantly of course, the workouts are great. They are not so hard that you can't do them, but really do give you an excellent workout. Since I have a number of the videos I change them up so it never gets boring.

I am not sure what sparked me to buy her video (I don't watch The Biggest Loser), but I am so happy that I did and have since purchased her other workout videos. I feel great, feel my body changing, and I am so much happier.

I like that you only need hand weights and a mat, as opposed to P90X (I injured myself in a ludicrously absurd way) and the Brazilian Butt Lift video (the instructor comes off like an idiot and the workouts are boring). Some of her videos are 20 minute workouts (I have 2 kids so this is a plus), but even these make you sweat and really work hard.",1365206400,,1010,4.201030927835052
3319668,5,B00127RAJY,"did these workouts and rest for a month and definitely are wonderful. It is best if you do only one level, you feel much better when finished. Well .... do all three together is wonderful. The stress goes away when you finish doing all three workouts together. I liked it too, because this video could develop physical condition to withstand without any problems the exercises on the DVD of ""6 weeks 6 pack abs"".
Even now I can combine both DVDs and end up feeling good about myself and without much physical pain",1365206400,,513,4.526881720430108
3319669,5,B00127RAJY,"I started this workout at the end of January 2013. I do it about 5 times per week and lost 15 pounds. I stick mostly to level 1 because my brain is now trained to put me in hypnosis after the first circuit! (I do not like exercising...). I rub my knees with a little menthol oil after each workout as I can feel them and want to prevent inflammation.

This is the only workout that makes me look forward to the jumping jacks (to catch my breath!)

The big pros are the price and the fact that for only 20 minutes per day, nobody can find an excuse strong enough not to do it.

Than you Jillian
P.s. I am over forty and after having four kids thought that it was not possible to get back in shape because of our slower metabolism. Myth busted!",1365120000,6,742,4.068493150684931
3319670,5,B00127RAJY,"This video has three workouts, all very intense, that only take half an hour. I went to the gym 2-3 times per week before starting this video, and it is definitely more intense than my 1-1.5 hour workouts. I am sweating, muscles burning, and most importantly, I can see the difference!  I still only exercise 2-3 times per week, but the time I spend doing this video is having a much better impact than my gym time was.  While I found even level 1 intense when I first started, Jillian has two other women with her in the video - one doing a harder version of each exercise, and one doing an easier version, so even beginners can do this video.

I also really like the ""patter"" that Jillian gives during the video. Good motivational chatter. My one complaint is that she uses the word a$$ - since I am doing this video at home, often with my kids in earshot, I wish she would have kept it totally clean. Swear words are totally unnecessary.  I later bought another Jillian video in hopes of getting more great stuff, and didn't like it nearly as much as this one.",1365120000,,1063,4.353535353535354

I will say that I am a HUGE Jillian fan, and bought and mainly used this DVD when I was first starting to get into shape. I think it is a great workout for beginners. The 3-2-1 system (strength, cardio, and abs) is very time effective and makes the workout flow well. It seems shorter than it is, and it's already short. If you are an intermediate or advanced exerciser though, this probably really isn't for you. I still occasionally use this if I want a quick workout, but it is not really difficult for me anymore at all.

With two very small children, I can't make it to the gym, so I do work-out videos at home daily.  This was the first video I tried after the birth of my first child.  For me, even just a couple weeks after giving birth, it was way too easy and not enough of a burn.  I would bundle work out 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 1 and 3 to even feel like I was getting a work-out.  None of these work-outs made me sore.  For people who are used to being more physically active and looking for somewhat of a challenge, I would suggest instead trying No More Trouble Zones or Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  If you're looking for a really challenging work-out, try Killer Buns and Thighs.  I think Jillian is a great trainer, but this one is just too wimpy for me!",1364774400,,915,4.011049723756906

I work out in the gym, etc. I therefore thought this would be very easy. I guess it was the lunges/squats that got me as I'm not used to doing them. The day after doing this I could barely walk.  I am on day two post-work out and still hobbling around. I think that part of the problem is that I only had 8 pound weights and that is too much to use in conjunction with aerobic style moves/lunges.  I am going to go out and buy 3 and 5 pound weights.

3319755,5,B00127RAJY,"About me: I am a 37-year old mother who had my two kids in my 30s. With the first one I developed hypothyroidism and so have trouble losing weight. I also have Diastasis Recti from my second baby and so can't do certain moves, like popping up from lying down on my back.

I LOVE this video! I cried through it the first time I did it, but quickly mastered Level 1. I started the video a week before Thanksgiving and did it three times a week to alleviate some of the heavy Holiday foods I knew I'd be eating, and I can honestly say that even eating tons of fatty foods for the six week holiday season I did not gain a single ounce - just from doing this video three times a week on Level 1.

Yes, it's difficult. And, because of my Diastasis Recti I can't fully do all of the ab exercises completely, but I simply do my best and do what I can. I cannot emphasize this enough: PROPER FORM IS IMPORTANT! And, GIVE YOURSELF A DAY TO REST BETWEEN WORKOUTS! Or, at least, do another workout video so you work different muscles.

In more than four months I've made it to Level 3 and feel great! Combined with eating better I've lost 12 pounds and I feel strong and healthy.

If you've absolutely never ever worked out before I recommend watching the entire video first and learning, either with a full-length mirror or investing in one session with a personal trainer, how to do proper squats and lunges. I, personally, do 10 minutes of my own yoga stretches first to open up my lower back and hips, which are very tight as a result of my weak abdominal muscles from Diastasis Recti. This helps me, but also I've worked out in the past and know how to do lunges and squats properly.

Like all other exercise, you get out of it what you put into it. If you phone it in you won't get results. If you try your best and push yourself you'll soon feel ready to move up to other levels.",1364774400,2,1874,4.20891364902507

I've never been a fit person, and the fact that I'm out of breath running after the bus despite only being 27 is an embarrassment. I tried exercising by going to the gym - it's expensive, time-consuming for travel, too many people hogging the machines. I tried jogging for a while, thinking I'll at least get cardio in - but I hate running in the daytime in front of a lot of people, the weather is hectic in my area, and running at night isn't safe either due to wildlife. This is when I decided to try the home workout DVDs. I only wanted to try the ones that had good reviews. First one I tried was P90X - I was traumatized for at least 6 months straight. 5 minutes of P90X led me to 2 weeks of burning, unbearable pain. I gave up on that one. Then I came across Jillian Michaels' DVDs, and it's a godsend. It is intensive enough without being overly intimidating. The first time I tried it, I did feel the burn and had about 3 days of intense leg pain. But I went back to it after a week's rest, and it worked out fine. Jillian is right in the DVD when she says ""your body will adapt."" I sometimes lose motivation, but I can always come back to it. Some people say she ""talks too much"" - that's what works for me, it's great motivation to push you through. I'm now able to run for the bus without losing my breath!

For people who have complained about knee injuries - I noticed that most, if not all of them, were already aware of their health problems/knee weakness - it just goes to show that if you already have major health problems, CONSULT A DOCTOR before starting any sort of diet/exercise programs. This cannot be stressed enough. I have low iron deficiency and I always talk to my doctor before starting any sort of diet/exercise regimes.",1364256000,,1845,4.271428571428571

I have only did the level 1 so look forward to moving up!",1364256000,,380,3.675
3319816,4,B00127RAJY,"I bought this to replace going to Zumba class. This is NOT Zumba. Much harder, much more focused, much sweatier. She has two helpers going through the routines with her. One does a modified version, which is helpful for beginners. It took me almost a week to work up to being able to go through the whole 20 minutes, but she's right that change WILL happen fast. Among the things I appreciate about this workout is that you get occasional glimpses of the helpers cheating or wincing as they go through the moves. YES! Even hot, smiling Amazons with rippling abs get tired!  The only downside is that there's a lot of introduction/ads before you can access the main menu. Now, I just put it in 5 minutes before I want to start and keep the TV off. Otherwise, I highly recommend this.",1364256000,,782,4.468531468531468

3319820,5,B00127RAJY,"Jillian knows how to get you moving, sweating and burning fat!  This was my first workout video purchase and I was very pleased with it.  I love her 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute ab circuits.  When you finish you feel like you have had a full body workout and you will be warmed up and sweating.

I found Level 2 to be the easiest of the three levels because it focuses on the plank pose and I found those moves to be more comfortable for me.  I find lunges to be the most difficult move for me to master.

The 30 Days consist of 10 days of each level, but I worked Level 1 until I could complete the non-modified version of all moves without pausing.  I think it took me 14 days!  But it felt great to kick Level 1's butt.

Great video...great workout....Highly recommended!!!",1364256000,,794,4.275167785234899
3319821,5,B00127RAJY,WOW- I'm 37 and out of shape. My daughter is 17 and in ok shape. My husband is 45 and thought he was in shape.  We are doing this video and it's amazing how in just three workouts we can tell it's working because we all feel BETTER in shape.  Very fun but challenging.  Since it's only 20 mins you feel like you can do it daily,1364256000,,327,3.8507462686567164
3319832,5,B00127RAJY,"Can I just say this:  WOW Jillian!  This is an amazing workout, especially when you consider that it is only 20 minutes.

Here's the thing - I am a habitual quitter in my workout and diet routines.  I started a very doable diet about 6 weeks ago and have actually stuck with it, but hit the plateau at 11 lbs.  I decided it was time to commit to working out, too, but I can't stand gyms.  All those skinny people just don't motivate me!

And then I found Jillian.  I should tell you that I have done level one of this DVD exactly twice.  Day one was when it was delivered.  I was SO excited.  I shut the door so hubby couldn't watch me bouncing around like a crazy person with breathing problems and popped that DVD in.  10 minutes in, and you are feeling the burn, my friend.  For someone not in shape at all, minutes 16 - 20 are PURE TORTURE.  I was so proud when I actually finished it.

Now, halfway through, Jillian mentions something about cutting out hours at the gym.  Pure talk, right?  Oh, no!  It is not!  The next morning, I could barely walk, my muscles were so tight.  A word to the wise:  if you are not a person who has worked out in 6 months, you may want to go to bed with a bottle of naproxen after this workout.  I hobbled through the day a little discourage because it had taken such a toll, but then I realized that I literally felt like I'd been at the gym 2 hours.  So I rested that day and came back to it.  And do you know what?  I was a little stiff when I started, but got right back into it and went through it with SO much more enthusiasm on day 2.  I will update down the road, but I'm pretty sure this is a workout I can stick to!",1364169600,4,1662,3.9908536585365852
3319833,5,B00127RAJY,"I have never watched the biggest Loser, so I didn't know Jillian.  This 20 minutes a day was challenging and gave me results.  I have lost 12 lbs (eating ""clean"" is part of it!) by diligently sticking to the SHRED.  I never missed a day.  Today is DAY 30.  Down a pant size, a dress size, a blouse size.  I have a rock hard stomach.  My thighs have some definition (like the old days), and I am seeing some nice cuts in my biceps and shoulders.  I am on my way, totally motivated, and back for the second edition:  EXTREME SHRED.  I can get through ANYTHING if it's just 20 minutes.  I could squeeze it in quickly and know I got an amazing workout.  Totally on a roll!  Don't hesitate, just do it.  It's not EASY, but it's doable.  Also excellent that she gives 3 levels, each with two versions:  beginner and advanced.  At the end of 30 days, I was doing Advanced level 3, but when I started, I couldn't even get through level 1, ""beginner"" without resting briefly here and there.  Have fun watching your fat melt away.",1364169600,7,1020,4.278947368421052

The only thing I would like to see would be a little more thorough of a warmup and cooldown, but I can do that on my own. Her main thing is to get the workout part in. I am not a huge Biggest Loser fan, but I really like Jillian Michael's videos. She might be annoying to some people at times, but I have done tons of workout videos and have never seen one that doesn't have a review criticizing the ""annoying"" instructor. So anyway, I think it is a great trio of workouts, and I mix them up over the course of the week with yoga, running, lifting weights in the gym, other workout videos, playing with my kids, housework, etc... They are a great deal and great for the time-pinched folks!",1364169600,,803,4.254901960784314

I did not like how it is 30 days. I do it every 2-3 days. I will weight lift and do yoga more than this video, only because it is strenuous, but you need to give your muscles a break. This work out is perfect. If you feel like you cannot do a lot, then don't. Just build up the muscles and then go for it. I made the video last 3 months instead of 30 days. I love this so much though! VERY SATISFIED!",1364169600,,567,3.5806451612903225

I just had my second baby and never got back in shape after the first. It is hard making to the gym long enough to get a good work out in when you are a mom. I heard all the rave about the 30 day shred through instagram and decided what the heck, why not? I am soo impressed. I have knee injuries and this work out kicks my butt (in a good way) without KILLING my knees. Yet i have seen amazing results. I am so happy with this product. After about two weeks of this and already seeing results I had to order her butt and thighs dvd. Jillian delivers amazing results. I feel so great! LOVE LVOE LOVE IT! After 2 weeks I am already back to my pre-pregnancy weight and I am keeping on it. Not to mention I am breastfeeding and cannot ""food"" diet.

Unlike some of my other Jillian Michael's CDs, there is no way to skip the intro everytime you start the CD, so no matter which program you are on, you waste 5 minutes each and every time,  Also, many of the same exercises that are on ""Ripped in 30"".  I was looking for new routines.",1364169600,4,347,4.476190476190476

3319840,3,B00127RAJY,"Jillian does a nice job coaching you through this video, and it's definitely true that you can do all her moves in your living room. I've been using this after shorter runs, when my calorie burning ability should technically be at it's highest. I'm still pretty doubtful that I would be shredded in 30 days. In fact, it's been 90. I'm in good shape, but I'm pretty sure doing this video alone would not do the trick.

The workouts have good variation and are challenging enough, in my opinion. I like that it's not dependent on lifting heavy weights, but rather on reps. It feels like a real workout, even though it is short. But like I said, I've been doing it on top of a pretty serious running schedule, and I find her ""cardio"" annoying. I would like this video a lot better if she tossed the cardio and added the extra time to abs.

In short, this is good as workout videos go. I really like Jillian's style and will probably purchase more of her workouts. In fact, I'm surprised to hear her referred to as ""tough"". She seems pretty approachable and encouraging to me.",1364083200,,1072,4.436548223350254

I wasn't aware that I would not be able to start the video and start working out within a minute.....you cannot fast forward to the menu, you have to listen to Jillian tell you a bunch of hoopla before you are ""allowed"" to start the workout - which seems like an eternity - probably at least 3 -4 minutes.  It's extremely annoying and when you buy a dvd, you should be able to peruse through it to get to where you want to start.  Again, very annoying.  workout is excellent.  Jillian - you need to shut out the advertisements.. I won't buy again.",1364083200,,575,4.247706422018348
3319872,5,B00127RAJY,"Get this DVD, get it, get it now! I can't say enough about this DVD. Jillian suggests doing each of the 3 levels for 10 days each to get shredded in 30 days. I wanted to complete the program before I put in my two cents. So let me start by saying, I followed the program, 10 days on each level, 30 days with no rest days.

I am also on Weight Watchers and I follow the program closely, this DVD (no DVD) will help if you don't couple it with a healthy, light diet. I lost 9 pounds during the month I did it, I would have lost more I think, but I'm breastfeeding, so I'm careful not to lost more than 2 pounds a week.

There's a lot of leg work in this DVD, lots of lunges, squats and jumping, so if you have knee troubles be careful. Don't be completely discouraged however, I have some knee trouble too, but I was careful to do the moves properly as Jillian explained and when I needed to I did them slowly to keep the right form. I made it through the entire program without any serious knee pain.

That said, I was sore, many times, I felt muscles I didn't know about, but it was the good I-worked-out-hard-today kind of sore. There were times I wanted to quit doing lunges, but I would look down and see how defined my thighs were becoming. When I wanted to get the hell out of plank position I would notice how ripped my arms were becoming and I would keep going.

This DVD is challenging and effective. It's 25 minutes a day, it's $7.99 or less if you do the instant DVD (which I did) and it works. Just buy it and do the workout. If you eat right and do the DVD, you will get results.",1364083200,3,1591,4.041269841269841
3319873,5,B00127RAJY,I use it almost every day. It is tailored to those just starting out but it is also good for those who have a different intensity level. I don't like the music they play so I mute the video and play my own music.,1363996800,,212,3.840909090909091
3319874,1,B00127RAJY,"Jillian Michaels acts like a drill sergeant. She constantly barks orders and demands that the person trying to keep up doesn't stop. She even makes an insulting comment about how she has 400 pound people doing this so we can do it and there's no excuses to not work out.
The pace of the video was intense. I did the beginning work out and was so sore I could barely get out of bed the next day. I forced myself to go into work and I had such a hard time walking around my classroom that I had to keep sitting down, which is not a good thing to do. My whole entire body hurt so bad, but my friends said no pain no gain so I tried it again. Could get past the first few min because the pain was so excruciating. I am not a whimp when it come to pain. I usually don't take anything if something hurts, but after this video I was in almost the worst pain in my life.",1363996800,3,862,3.9314285714285715

3319876,2,B00127RAJY,"I bought the 30-day Shred as a tool to take with me when traveling and staying in hotels.  The Level 1, 2, 3 is a great idea.  However, the inability to fast forward over the instructions and introductions is seriously frustrating.  When pressed for time (hello, the idea of 20-minute workouts was supposed to be for time pressed people...), having to sit through the same dialogue over and over again just gets annoying.

My fitness level is intermediate and I need to lose about 18lbs.  So, I'm not someone who is like on the Biggest Loser who needs to lose 50lbs+.  However, I found moving into Level 2 the plank positions and quick moves from standing to the planks was for people with a much higher fitness level.

I am disappointed in this product.",1363910400,,754,4.582089552238806

3319878,1,B00127RAJY,"I recently bought this dvd since I've used 'Bob's' Biggest Loser exercise videos and I've heard good reviews on this tape. However, suggesting a weight loss of 20 lbs in 30 days is irresponsible without basing this on how overweight a person is and without encouraging physician advice as this is very rapid weight loss. Further, I was quite dismayed at the notion that 'anyone' can do jumping jacks, including another reviewer with 'bad knees'. Whether or not you can do jumping jacks is not a function of how much you weigh. However, I have sever arthritis and one knee is reduced to bone on bone. So THIS 'anyone' has doctor's advice to not do standard jumping jacks or other high impact moves. I can walk in place and move my arms in the proper motion, but jumping and hard hits will place me back on crutches. I almost didn't buy the tape because I was so angry at the total nonsense and lack of judgement in this advice! Please consult your doctor's advice on what you can and can't do! Anyone who relys on this lady's questionable advice may do themselves real physical harm. Most people can find excercise they can do, but Bob's tape seems more reasonable on providing alternate moves for real needs.

______

Updates: I've watched the DVD I purchased. This is the worst exercise video I've ever purchased. Jillian's form is pathetic. Every once in a while, she throws in a comment about form and what not to do to that might cause injuries, but overall, good advice is missing. I winced watching the knees bending to the floor and extending far over the foot during lunges. The cardio is boring and nothing but jump rope and jumping jacks. This is not a tape for anyone with knee joint damage.

You will also have to stomach Jillian's endless noise of stressing and pushing the body. Yes, you must work hard to see results but you do not have to do high impact aerobics nor do you need to do the worst excuse for squats ever to be marketed to the public. Absolutely hideous and going in the trash.

The ONLY redeeming parts of the DVD are the ab workout segments. I know Jillian has faced critics and claims to have certifications to teach but that doesn't mean she is qualified or that she has any working knowledge of the body, joints, and proper exercise form. At least no knowledge is evident in her ridiculous claims of weight loss nor in her horrific examples of exercises. Please talk to your doctors and do a hard workout that doesn't hurt your joints!",1363737600,13,2469,4.5415730337078655

I wasn't too crazy about the music and not being able to skip parts of the introduction, but that's not such a bad thing.  Some people have complained about repetitiveness in terms of doing the same level everyday for an extended period of time, but you can mix it up.  However, the advantage of doing the same level for a period of time is that you allow yourself to learn proper posture and build your strength depending on your level of fitness.

I want to feel better about me but I don't have time or money for a gym membership and I have heard wonderful things about the 30 day shred.  I did it this morning and wow!  Jillian worked my ass off!  I haven't worked this hard since high school track.  I made it through the whole session with maybe 3 five second breaks.  It's hard and I wanted to give up but I just kept thinking about future me.  Me without love handles and me with clothes that fit like they are supposed to.  By the end I just wanted to lay down but I kept walking around and did the dishes, swept the floor, and gathered laundry.  I feel like this was a good idea because I was still moving and my heart rate was lowering naturally instead of me just falling over. I will update this in a week and see how I am still doing.  Also, I used the tip to use canned goods instead of weights and I felt like this was a good substitute. I will invest in some weights when I have kept this up for a few weeks.

Don't ge me wrong, you are constantly moving and it will kick you butt for that 25 minutes!!  It's the only workout video that I actually looked forward to doing every morning at 6 am and felt extremely guilty for missing it (Lord knows, I have plenty to chose from).

I'm still panting and sweating after I do the level one workout so I will keep at this level for at least a few more days.
Jillian can sound a little annoying at times, but for the most part her instructions help me to push through the workout.

What I dislike is her opening description that is part of the root menu so I can't fast forward through it.",1362960000,,523,4.058252427184466

Do the forms as she said or duh you will have hurt knees or back. My knees started hurting but then I noticed I wasn't doing the lunges correctly to begin with so I fixed it. As for results can't say yet, just started but overall I like it!",1362960000,,551,4.158878504672897

I don't like to work out to begin with and definitely need to push myself to do so.  When I saw this DVD, I figured I'd give it a try. It was only 30 minutes, if that, and I was able to do it first thing in the morning before I leave for work.  My goal was to have energy got my long days but I always wanted to lose some weight and get toned.  I have to say I was able to accomplish all 3 goals with this DVD, along with eating right and taking vitamins daily.

So I tried it for 30 days, lost 10lbs and was able to maximize my energy for the day.  I did it about 3-4 times a week on average, 2-3 days I would just use the treadmill, and have one day's rest.

I liked the circuits the DVD offered between strength, cardio and abs.  They show the exercise routine for beginners and for other's that are more advanced. Out of all 3 workout routines, the 2nd was my least favorite, it required more coordination than the other two videos and I'm not that coordinated to begin with.  So I pretty much skipped it and went to the 3rd workout, which was my favorite of them all.

Great DVD, I was skeptical but I definitely saw the results.",1362873600,2,1317,3.973384030418251
3320052,5,B00127RAJY,"I just finished day two of level 1 and I'm ecstatic! What a sweat for only 25 minutes! I downloaded this to my computer because for $4.99, what could I loose (I mean other than lbs)?! I've never tried a JM workout before, but I've been a fan of her on the BL since the beginning! Boy does she deliver! I'm a hefty gal at 5'2"" and 198 lbs, however to say I'm completely sedentary would be inaccurate. I'm 21 years old and work at a restaurant where I'm constantly buzzing about, hauling silverware, ceramic plates, ice buckets, and pushing towering cup racks. Of course to say I'm in any type of athletic shape is unfair too, but I want to make it clear that I don't sit at desk. So grossly overweight, armed with only an old yoga mat, I attempted this workout yesterday and made it out on the other side alive. I had to take a few brief breaks, tried to keep 'em less than 5 seconds like Jillian said, but I never became discouraged or quit. I think it probably helped that I didn't have weights the first day, as it kept pressure off my unconditioned chest. Sweaty and gross after completing the workout, I ran upstairs for a quick shower. The entire rest of the day I was bouncing with energy, and I didn't feel sore in the slightest. Of course I felt quite different this morning! Every muscle ached upon waking an hour ago. Almost decided not to do the workout again, because I have a double today at the restaurant and know I'm going to be tired. But then I thought, hey, 30 days ain't nothing. If I choose, yesterday could be the day I changed it all. So I put JM on. And I thought I wouldn't make it through the first circuit. But I did, albeit I struggled through soreness with the strength training (I went out and bought 3 lb dumbbells yesterday). And then I breezed through the last two circuits. Okay. So maybe not breezed. But I made it through the cardio without breaking, and that's HUGE for a little lifetime asthmatic like me. I've made it my mission to do this for 30 days, 10 days of each level. Perhaps around day 15 and definitely at day 30 I'll revise this with an update of what I hope will be great results!

I literally despise working out. After doing this the first night I thought I was going to DIE. I tried so hard to keep up. I even went along with the ""beginner"" instructor, and absolutely could not stay with her. I had to take so many breaks along the way that Jillian tells you not to do! I am going to admit I only did the video about three or four times before giving up. It was just way too much for me to push myself to do. I don't have the motivation or will power to go through with the full 30 days. Since ordering the DVD I have also gained even more weight...wish I could make myself do it...but it really is a rough workout.

I asked around on Facebook and the first 5 comments I got were to recommend this workout program, and then I had even more endorsements after that.  I've been doing this workout since last week and I can tell you I'm already feeling a difference.  The first few days my quads burned SO bad and I had a hard time going up and down stairs.

This is my first Jillian Michaels product and I am already going to buy more of her DVDs. My only complaint is that when you first put the DVD in, it takes a while to get to the actual exercising, and there is no way to fastforward through the filler in the beginning. Since I generally do the DVD in the morning, I now pop it in, go brush my teeth, put on my shoes, get some water, etc, and it is ready to go by the time I am back in the room.

However, at the rate at which I'm losing inches, I may have to just settle for being my old size instead of my old weight!

I've really only lost 3 lbs as at the end of week 2, but my thighs are significantly slimmer and so is my torso. I'm still not seeing much progress in the waist area, but I still have a week and a half to go. I also plan to start with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism (BFBM) right after I'm done with 30DS so I can get enough cardio to really burn those problem areas.

Level 3 really is no joke.  She has some workout moves in this dvd that I've never seen before.  They are all about working more than one muscle group at a time.

I am in decent shape but recovering from a back injury which helped me put on an extra 10 pounds over the past few years.  This workout kicked my butt and I have already lost some body fat.  I love her workouts and that is why I am so disappointed in the website (jillianmichaels.com).  I thought I was able to create a login to check out her sight for free and I denied any charges and/or upgrades.  I honestly don't remember giving them my credit card and the card they charged has been sitting in a drawer for 6 months...I was charged on 2/2/13.  When I disputed the charge with jillianmichaels.com they refused to refund me.  I explained I would never have agreed to this because I am in school full time and not working so I could not afford this at all.  I looked at the site once and never went back.  Honestly, not sure what they are charging $52 a quarter for exactly..so I can log my food and exercise?  Myfitnesspal app does that better and for free.  She does give you some meal recommendations but I am a dietetics major and a vegetarian so those were of no interest to me.  The site may be a great resource for some but just not for me.  Just beware that there is a charge and you have to email them or call them to cancel, there is no way to simply do it from the website.  I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did.

So only opportunity is exercise at home. Only after first week using the DVD my hubby said that my butt got firmer , LOL! I'm using second level now and I feel my body is getting stronger and leaner.
I got this DVD only to get my body stronger and leaner, because 6 month ago I gave birth to my baby and I lost the baby weight already :)
Overall, great DVD, but I am not sure if it is possible to lose all the weight it says, because I'm 5'7 and weight 122 lb ( same as pre-baby), so I don't need to loose too much weight, only to gain strength and get my belly and bottom back in shape....

The first workout wasn't what I was expecting. Kind of expected to feel dead by the end of it rather than feeling energized and ready for more. Lol
Its over before you know it!

I'm not in the worst shape, but then again I'm active duty military,  so I kind of have to
Stay in decent shape.
I bought some 3 lb weights to go with it. I think I need 5lb weights when I start level 2.

That being said, I'm still a weakling and hate doing exercise. Running is my enemy. Lol

Level one of this video is a great way to start. It will keep your ego up while you build back strength and energy that you lost from being lazy for a year.
Level 2 will probably kick my ass. And I'm looking forward to it :)

I bought this with the yoga meltdown so I could alternate days so I wouldn't get tired of doing the SAME thing everyday.
I will try the YM tomorrow. It gets pretty good reviews as well.",1361923200,,982,4.01025641025641

I don't mind walking the dog around the block but anything with weights?  Forget it. If I can do this, anyone can. It's not easy but it's only 27 minutes so definitely doable! Just press play! Once it's over you will be glad you did it! I actually gained 1.4 pounds while doing this (was already at goal weight) but I lost a pant size!

The sequence is good, I like the cardio, strength and abs split but the getting up and down is annoying for a person like me who is not that mobile yet.

It was definitely doable for motivated beginners (as another reviewer put it), but I was sore for a day or two afterwards. It definitely gets your heart rate up and your muscles going in a way that you don't get on the treadmill or elliptical at the gym, pushing you out of your comfort zone. Switch up the lessons on different days to avoid boredom.

You do need a set of hand weights (if you're just starting out, don't be fooled by how light 2 or 3 pound weights feel at the store--you'll be doing plenty of reps with them, and they feel heavy fast. Save the heavier weights for later in your fitness journey) and a mat, but that's it. I love that it's minimal and doesn't require you to shell out much extra money.",1361836800,,806,4.233766233766234
3320213,5,B00127RAJY,"Wow!  This is a great workout!  I believe doing this dvd every day helps get me ready for the day and for the next work out.  I'm 48 so I started sort of with low impact, I try to throw in high impact as much as possible.  I have to keep in mind, don't push it to the point of hurting yourself because then you won't be able to do it again for awhile.  The first 10 days of Level 1, I felt so great.  By the 4th day, I was doing high impact.  By the 7th day I could feel my strength building on the workouts.  Now I'm 6 days in to Level 2 and I feel so much stronger.  I know I'll finish this and then I'll start over.  When I start over, I'll make the workouts more high impact, I'll push myself harder.  I'll go lower on the push ups, I'll reach higher on the sit ups, etc.  I'm sore, not a painful sore, a worked sore.  I feel great.  I have more energy.  I'm too tired to snack - lol!

My husband says he definitely sees definition in my sides.  I am also doing weight lifting 3x a week at home, free style.  I also am using a variety of Jillians other dvds on the days that I don't lift weights.  So, for instance today, I did the 30 day Shred this morning and then lifted weights for 2 hours - then I'll go walking after work.  Tomorrow, 30 days shred and then Jillian's 6 Week 6 Pack, Thurs will be 30 Day Shred and then Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, One of the weight training days, I also do the No More Trouble Zones.  I'd love to have all her dvd's.  I just don't know when I'd work them in right now.

Keep bringing the great workouts Jillian!

Update:  Mar. 6, 2013:  I'm on Level 3 now:  I spent the past couple days with a virus (I believe) which attacked the muscles.  It didn't help that I worked out everyday - hard - for 7 days straight and didn't take a day off. I tried to lift weights, too sore and too tired to stick with it.

Wednesday, today, I did Level 3 of 30 Day Shred but at the lowest level you can imagine. For instance, walking planks were done on my knees including the traveling push ups, the jump squats and rock star jumps were just getting my feet off the ground so basically a low level jump rope effort, (lol) scissor crunches involved my feet higher in the air - instead of a few inches from the ground, I was able to do the alternating punches holding dumbbells in the squat position, the butt kicks with dumbbells was basically getting my feet off the ground - bending my knees just hurts while jumping (hence, achy muscles) - I feel bruised still from the virus, the alternating jumping lunges were just low level lunging forward and back. It felt like it went quickly.

I'm glad I did it - I worked up a sweat - I'm going to do a walking dvd next. Instead of spending 10 days on level 3 I believe I'll spend 13 due to the virus making me do it at such a low impact. I'm glad I did it!",1361750400,2,2828,3.9982142857142855
3320214,5,B00127RAJY,Great workout for all levels of fittness. I got bored with the lower levels even though I wasn't fit enough to move on to the higher level but I tried it anyway and there is a low impact version of all three levels.,1361750400,,215,4.023255813953488
3320215,2,B00127RAJY,"Any CONSISTENT exercise, especially for someone who does not already exercise much, will make you lose weight.  For this reason, doing this video for 30 days straight would certainly make people lose weight and get stronger.  However, for a person to stay fit for good, a person needs to exercise not just for 30 days, but for a lifetime, and this video would not encourage me to do that.

Every step of the way, Michaels urges viewers to do her workout so that they can ""change"" their bodies.  She continually points to her two assistants, women who are very muscular and who have very little body fat, and says things like: ""Look at her abs.  You want abs like that?  Do this exercise.""  Or: ""See that crease above her butt?  Hot, right?  If you want that, do this exercise.""

But these are lies, and they're harmful lies.  Will your body ""change"" from doing this workout video for 30 days?  Sure, sort of.  You'll lose some weight.  You'll gain some muscle.  But it will still be YOUR body.  You and I will never have that woman's abs or that other woman's butt crease, regardless of how much exercise or dieting we do.  Can we have stronger abs/butts than we currently do, with less fat on them?  Sure.  But they will still be our abs and our butts.

In level 3 of this video, Michaels says, ""If you've been doing this for 30 days, you should already be feeling that six-pack.""  Um, maybe if you already had one before you began her video regimen?  Let me tell you something.  I was a Division I college athlete for four years.  I ran 50 miles a week.  I did 9 minutes of abs with no rest every single day.  And ladies and gentlemen, I never had a six-pack.  Never.  Not once.  And that ""pouch"" at the bottom of your stomach that Michaels assures you her workout will help you get rid of?  Even at my fittest, I always had it.  Why?  Because that's how my body was designed.  And you know what else?  I'm FINE with that.  I love my body.  I don't need a six-pack to love my body and to be beautiful, and neither do you.

If you're looking for a way to get in shape and stay motivated to work out past 30 days, find something that's fun to do and that makes you feel good about yourself.  Michaels will not make you feel good about yourself, and her workout is not particularly fun, or even convenient.  First of all, the workout requires hand weights.  Most people do not already have hand weights in all of the different sizes that would be necessary to reflect the gains in strength that they would make over time, so this is an added expense/inconvenience.  Michaels also relies on standard, run-of-the-mill exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and jumping jacks, so that even hardcore workers-outers will not be particularly inspired by her.  I was able to do all three levels back to back, and all I got from it was pissed off.

Her view of exercise is that the only reason you would want to be doing it would be to get ""hot.""  She insists that pain is gain and that the harder you work, the more attractive you'll get.  Though this could be effective motivation in the short term (let's say, for 30 days), it's not sustainable in the long run.  I would highly advise the beginners among you to find a more positive instructor who doesn't make false promises and encourage you to dislike your body (try Juliane Arney), and the advanced workers-outers among you to find a more challenging video, also with a more positive instructor who doesn't make false promises and encourage you to dislike your body.  (I don't particularly like Billy Blanks's style of instruction, but his advanced Tae-Bo workouts kill me.  I've also heard good things about the challenge level of P90-X, though I've never done it, and it does look expensive.)",1361664000,3,3737,4.4992548435171384

3320219,5,B00127RAJY,"For someone who never writes reviews for ANY product, (but does read them) I feel compelled to comment/rave about this workout and I'm only on my 5th DAY of THE 30 DAY SHRED.

I am the mom of two small kids. In my late 30s. Tall and fairly thin, yes, but not in particularly great shape as I've not really EVER worked out consistently. I've had several opportunities to join beautiful gyms due to my past employers offering substantial discounts but never, ever stuck with it.

Now, with two small kids and so little time in my day for anything, no money for the gym, expensive yoga classes, or babysitters to cover me for either, I've done nothing for myself, including taking care of my body and I'm closing in on 40. After reading the thousand of raves for the 30 Day Shred, I thought, fine, what's there to lose, right?... but secretly wondering WHEN I would actually lose interest and give it up.

5 days in and for the first time in my life, I WANT TO KEEP DOING IT AND FEEL A CHANGE IN MY BODY ALREADY.

What makes it different for me?
The length of the workout. Above all else, for a mom whose job never ends, the short time commitment is paramount. You are DONE before you know it and you feel like you worked hard. I have yet to feel like bailing and skipping a day the way I almost certainly would if this were a 45-50 minute workout. I can't stress this enough. The length of the workout is akin to a shot of confidence -- once you've done it twice, you know you can easily do it again and again.

The length of each circuit, the change-up of the exercises, coupled with the 3 different levels, makes it perfect for beginners AND perfect for more the advanced. It's my 5th day in I have not felt like I absolutely can't power through a tough part watching Anita on level 1. AND I see great potential in doing the Natalie moves (more difficult) as I improve, coupled with the 3 different levels for even more challenge. Even on day 5 I am able to do deeper, more advanced versions of some exercises.

Jillian is a great coach. She knows what to say, how to say it instruction-wise and WHEN. Everything she offers to ensure you are doing a move correctly is spot-on. When she describes the knot in your abs during the very last part, she is reading your mind and that acknowledgment is a confidence booster. In other words, it all feels natural and is easy to follow -- a perfect balance of instruction and encouragement considering I read so many gripes about other videos and how 'this or that' is irritating.

If you are sitting on the couch looking for inspiration, please give the 30 Day Shred a try... I am only 5 days in and an enthusiastic convert!",1361491200,4,2666,4.352112676056338

While I find that  the workouts are do-able, just the right duration, and effective, there's something about Jillian's voice that makes it seem that she herself doesn't enjoy the workouts, that the whole process is painful for her (the ""no pain no gain"" philosophy I suppose).

You will be doing yourself a disservice, however, if you do not complete more of a cool-down than is allotted on this video. If I have any complaint about the video it's that a lot of the exercises involve high-impact, which is not good for my slightly damaged middle-aged body. In most cases, although not all, she offers alternatives to the high-impact version, but they do not offer the same cardio intensity.",1360972800,,492,4.6022727272727275

3320284,5,B00127RAJY,"This workout is awesome, you see results quickly and it's not boring. Because of her 3, 2, 1 method, it keeps it interesting. I get bored when doing repetitive cardio, like jogging or being on the elliptical for 20 minutes, I feel like 20 minutes turns into 5 hours, then after that, sometimes I really don't feel it or see results fast!  This 20 minute workout really pushes you and it goes by  fast because of her method, which I love, and you will feel the ""burn"" in your muscles!  After the first day of doing this DVD, next day at work, I already had girls say, you look different. Everyone is different, but after 30 days, I lost weight, inches, feel great, and my endurance it a lot higher. I wish all workouts were this quick and effective!

But, you're supposed to do the same workout for 10 days in a row and never changing it up? Ever heard of muscle memory?! It gets boring. I've recently revamped my exercise regimen and i'm doing this every other day so as not to bore myself or let my body get used to it.",1360800000,,389,4.064935064935065

I am still carrying the 20 lbs I gained, but up till this point, didn't have the energy, drive, or time to exercise.  On Monday (2/11/13), I decided, enough was enough.  I can devote 20 minutes to myself in order to get my body back in shape, my cholesterol and triglycerides down, and get my self esteem back.  Today is Thursday (2/14/13) and I've lost 4.6 lbs.  Happy Valentine's Day to me :)  Even if this is water weight, I have to start somewhere.  I'm sure this is not typical weight loss for less than a week, or maybe it is?  I would highly recommend this video!!!!!!!",1360800000,4,649,4.262295081967213
3320317,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this in December sort of on a whim.  Also because it's cold out and getting to the gym seems to happen only in my head and not in reality lately.  I would describe myself as formerly athletic.  Currently moderately athletic (ran a half marathon in November, do some weights, some cardio) and 15 lbs over my ideal weight.  Even when I exercise consistently (like marathon/half marathon training), I have not been able to lose weight.

This DVD helped me lose 10 lbs over the holiday season, and I didn't try that hard (diet wise - I ate those Christmas cookies, no problem).  I completed 20 of the 30 prescribed days over December and January (20 workouts over 2 months).  I rotated the levels each day to avoid boredom.  The fact that it's over in 20-25 minutes meant it got done more consistently.  It also didn't leave me hungrier than usual (like running has).  And yet, I felt like I did get a workout in.  After the first 6 workouts, I noticed visible differences.  I've kept the weight off (again without trying hard) for almost two months now.

I'm now one of those crazy people who recommends this DVD to anyone that discusses any weight issue with me.  For less than $10, I recommend you give it a try.",1360713600,10,1220,4.486363636363636

I like that the video features two additional women besides Jillian.  One you follow if you are a beginner and the second one if you have been exercising and want to step it up a notch.  I like it because I can do the workout in the comfort of my home, not having to run out to a gym.  The important piece is that I am getting exercise and the financial outlay is  minimal!",1360627200,3,533,4.076923076923077

Didn't know what i was getting into... i normally just jog as a work out and recently needed a change... bought this and its a good workout.  Has three levels and starts out with slow to full workout. I was sweating and exhausted.  But felt really amazing. This is a good workout for me who never does anything.

3320322,4,B00127RAJY,"I was looking for a 30 minute workout that will give me maximum results for that amount of time.  I think this workout gives you a great combination of strength and cardio.  I've been doing it for about 12 days and it's still challenging for me.  I will upgrade to the next level once I feel like this one is no longer pushing me.  All you need is a mat (unless you're working out on carpet) and some ~3 pound hand weights.  You could go higher or lower, but three pounds works well.

The first time I used it, I did use it as the 30 day program and by day 14 my knee hurt so badly that I could barely walk on it. I've never had any knee problems before. It got better when I stopped. Just be careful as it is a little intense for daily use.

Day one was really hard but it was getting easier by the second week.",1360540800,,472,3.6176470588235294
3320324,5,B00127RAJY,I gave this five stars because in just the 3 weeks I have been doing her 20 minute workout I can see the results. I've lot 5 lbs and definitely inches I just haven't re measured yet. I love her guidance how to do the exercises correctly to avoid an injury and she gives motivation in JUST the right spots! One thing I will say is this is definitely hard on the knees. She offers modified versions for bad knees but it is still strenuous to the joints. Having the right shoe will really count when using this dvd. I am planning on buying some of her other DVDs after I'm finished with this one. I recommend to anyone who I serious about getting a quality workout in 20 minutes and is committed to really pushing themselves!,1360540800,2,722,4.2773722627737225

This is a real workout, not some frilly pretend workout.  It gave me immense satisfaction at the end knowing that I managed to stick with it for the whole 20 minutes and yet even though it's such a short workout it definitely made me sweat.  I am so pleased with this purchase, I was afraid it would be a waste of money, but this is a short amount of time out of my day and it's easy to stick to.",1360454400,,529,3.952830188679245

I bought some of Jillian's other dvds and am looking forward to trying them out (I just ordered them so they aren't here yet.) It's only 20 minutes but I'm sweating! I don't know how hard the other levels are (for those who are more fit) but I'm sure as they get progressively harder they are challenging for fit people too.

3320340,2,B00127RAJY,"I just finished the first workout immediately after a hard jog.  I really like how she does circuits, but she puts WAY too much emphasis on the shoulders.  A person should focus on the deltoids twice a week max.  I also take muay Thai three times a week and Brazilian jiu jitsu twice a week, and I simply wanted to add a great cardio and abs workout to my regimen. I wish she did 3 min cardio and 2 min strength training instead of the reverse. I was very unimpressed with the cardio.  I wasn't even breathing hard.  So far, I am liking Billy Blanks Boot Camp MUCH better.  I guess this would be a good workout for those who are not already active, though...",1360368000,,658,4.224
3320341,5,B00127RAJY,"I love to workout and needed something I could do that wasn't 60 minutes long. This video fits the bill! If I have more time than I just do two 20 minute workouts or all three if I have that much time. One thing I really don't like is that every time you do the video, you have to begin with her talking for five minutes, the dvd doesn't allow you to skip, fast forward or move to another section of the video until you hear her big mouth about how she is so fit and you gotta bring it yada yada yada.....",1360368000,,505,3.912621359223301
3320342,5,B00127RAJY,"Bought this DVD about two years ago but lost it so bought it again to shed some of the holiday pounds. Jillian's combination of workouts will really make you sweat and work for the whole twenty minutes. As she says, ""If you think you are going to die, that is when it is working."" She does a great job of giving examples for beginners as well as advanced level workouts. Also, the fact that all you need is some hand weights (use canned food if you don't want to buy some) is great too. Although the three levels can get monotonous. just mixing up the levels on different days keeps the workout intensive and interactive. Overall, great quality for a great price. If you are looking for a great workout without having to pay for expensive gym membership and have little time to get in an effective run, I highly recommend this DVD.",1360281600,,831,4.437908496732026
3320343,5,B00127RAJY,"If you are willing to commit to doing this workout, you WILL see results. I have done this challenge twice and plan on doing it again soon. But here's a secret - I didn't do it in 30 days. It took me longer because I only did it 3-4 days a week. The other days of the week I walked and jogged. The important thing is that you're adding variety to your exercise routine. I completed 30 sessions, just not all on back-to-back days. Jillian would probably holler up in my face for saying this, but if doing 30 Day Shred over 30 non back-to-back sessions (but no less often than every other day) is a more realistic goal for you, I say do it that way.

My favorite thing about this workout is that on the first day, 30 seconds of jumping jacks may about kill you. But on workout 6 or 7, you notice it's getting better. Near the end of the challenge, 30 second of cardio isn't a picnic, but feels GREAT.",1360281600,2,898,4.131428571428572
3320344,5,B00127RAJY,I workout 6 days a week and love hitting weights hard. Some days you want to do something but don't have the time to do an hour workout. These quick 20 minute workouts are great. Super effective and you can make them as hard as you want by modifying or adding higher weights. LOVE,1360281600,,280,4.203703703703703
3320358,4,B00127RAJY,"For only a twenty minute workout, this video definitely gets your heart rate up. I'm in decent shape - I don't work out all the time, but I bike commute to work most days (used to be 8 miles roundtrip, now its 20 miles), walk, and hike often. My heart rate definitely is up within the first few minutes of the video and some of my less used muscles are protesting quite a bit by the end. I did level 1 once and have been doing level 2 a few times a week. I haven't tried level 3 yet, but plan to soon. I like that there are 3 different workouts so you can switch it up and by using heavier weights you can make some of the exercises more difficult. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I think if you want to see more drastic results you probably need to do one of the longer videos. But I like that it is only 20 minutes since I don't usually have a lot of extra time and it gets in a little time working my abs, arms, and other trouble areas/less used muscles.",1360281600,,970,3.9289340101522843

Something I did not have. I also lost weight and inches. My clothes fit better, too. The shred is actually 27 minutes, but that's ok. It's still a short workout. Especially for those starting out. I like that the shred is based on Jillian's 3-2-1 system. 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. The workouts go by really fast. Each level is hard when you first begin, but gets better the more you do it. Doing the 30 Day Shred for a month got me into the habit of daily exercise which is a good thing. Jillian is no nonsense, but she gets the job done.

I haven't done the 30 day straight challenge, but have been content to use the video every other day or if the weather outside prohibits me from leaving my home.

What I like:
1) The workouts are easy to learn and there are modified versions for almost every exercise.
2) The workouts are effective, challenging your muscles and heart. I never fail to hit target heart rate with this one.
3) The workouts are quick, warm up through cool down takes just under a half hour.
4) The workouts require limited equipment, all you need is hand weights.

Cons:
5) For an advanced exerciser, i.e. someone who eats, sleeps and breathes circuit training, this video might not be challenging enough.

All in all, for the average human this video is an incredible deal.",1359590400,,899,4.713375796178344

My roommate and I are of average weight, but we've been putting on some fluff due to a spotty workout regime over the past few years. I got this DVD on a whim because it was a suggested item when I purchased some weights and at $8 I figured why not. We started this DVD two days ago and immediately we were feeling the burn. It's day 3 and we are both so sore that moving is a chore, but we feel AMAZING. My energy is back again and I feel more awake and focused than I have in a while. It may only be day three, but just based off of how sore I am, I know the results are going to be amazing. I can't wait to get a few more of her DVDs now so we can keep going even after these 30 days are up. Jillian's attitude and the way she breaks down everything you're doing and the reasons behind it encourage you to keep up with this workout. I haven't been in this much pain in a long time, but I still can't wait for my workout every day, Jillian makes it fun and keeps you motivated!

3320459,5,B00127RAJY,"Back in October 2012 I decided to make a lifestyle change by changing my eating habits and exercising to get in shape. I wanted to be healthy and look great at the same time! So I started making raw Green Juices/smoothies and recently I started incorporating more RAW meals into my life. I have lost 35 pounds thus far. I just purchased the 30 Day Shred and 10 minutes ago I just finished the fist workout. Let me tell you how great I feel (and by great I mean sore and limping). This tells me that I'm burning something and it is most likely fat! This workout gives me something that the treadmill can't give me and thats the feeling that my fat is melting away. I have twenty more pounds to go and I believe that working out to this daily will definitely get me there. I plan on using this in the morning and the Jillian Michaels Buns and Thighs DVD in the evening. I'll do the treadmill on the weekends. My plans are to get it off and keep it off FOREVER! This is a must have for your workout regimen! I'll definitely update in 30 days to let everyone know the 30 day results!

Jillian is tough, the workout is tough, but it goes quickly and she is personable enough that i don't think she will become annoying ...as some videos can.  She has a point - if you want to work out for only 20 minutes, it has to be a hard workout: every second must count.  i like the idea of switching between levels to keep the workout from being boring, and i like that she offers modifications so even higher levels can be attainable to keep it fresh and interesting.

3320465,2,B00127RAJY,"I did this program exactly as directed and lost zero weight. Level One is perfect for someone massively out of shape because it gets easier every few days. I moved to Level Two after a week but Three was too much for me as it wore on my spine. Jillian is motivating and not boring, and the idea that you are moving towards your goal is energizing. Until you reach the end with zero weight loss, zero sizes smaller, and just a temporarily higher endurance as the only change.
Other reviews show just how dangerous this is for your knees and spine. I had no idea! You may not care now, but trust me, when you can't work out AT ALL and can't work either and are home on the couch... you will gain more weight than you could imagine.

3320468,5,B00127RAJY,"Pros:

- Great variety! 3 minutes of strength is broken up into 2 different movements, so it's not 3 straight minutes of static lunges with bicep curls (for example). Same with cardio...jumping jacks, then jump rope, jumping jacks, jump rope.
- 3 levels based on intensity
- Each level includes modifications until you've worked up enough strength to do the full movement
- No excuse not to do it when each workout is only 30 minutes, including warm up and cool down
- Having a trainer tell you what to do and how to do it every time makes it easy to commit to a workout
- You can feel a difference in your endurance and strength each time you work out. You know when you're ready for the next level, so there's no guessing ""is this working?""

Cons:

Each level is a routine--that is, level one is the same every time you do it. So if you're a beginner like me, you'll be insanely sore for the first 3 days and there is no break for those muscles--you do the same routine every day, even if your pecs and quads are killing you.

DVD menu: You can't skip past the intro to get to the main menu and start the exercise. Turn on the DVD player a few minutes before you're ready to work out so you don't have to sit and watch the same intro every time.

Audio: I wish there was an option for just Jillian's voice instruction without music, but instead, you can choose to hear the music without her instruction. You get tired of the same music every time. I'll blast some club music in the background, but I still need to keep the DVD volume loud enough to know when to switch moves (you're not always staring at the TV) and the DVD music interferes with what I want to listen to.",1358899200,2,1674,4.251572327044025
3320469,5,B00127RAJY,"I was kind of at the end of my rope, and knew I had to make some changes. Started slow by gradually weeding things out of my diet, but I knew I'd need to start working out.

I dreaded it so much.

I hate to exercise. My feet fall asleep due to vein issues (yes, even barefoot, so it's not tight shoes), I get overheated and faint, and I hate how I feel so weak and incapable. I can sit in a room and play clarinet for 5 hours at a time, but 20 minutes of cardio feels like hell on earth. I'm 39, in the overweight category of BMI, have 2 young kids, and the most exercise I usually get is chasing kids and a short walk to get the dog to poop. I knew it was going to be really hard to do, so when I finally broke mentally, I downloaded this, set up my 3 lb. weights, yoga mat, water and shoes, and bit the bullet.

I'm on day 2 of this, and I already love it. (I am so shocked!)

Day one was hard. I had to stop the playback several times to catch my breath, lay on the floor and put my feet above my head to get the blood flowing correctly again. I hated having to stop, when the cardio was only 3 minutes.  I was sore all over, but finally got that first exercise high I've heard about (that I never got, even when I'd do 90 minute high impact step aerobics back in the 90's.)

Day two was today, and it took a lot of mental gymnastics to get me to hit play (and some Advil. Still sore.) My goal was to get through with fewer stops. I MADE IT WITH NO STOPS AT ALL!!! I can't believe it myself! Yesterday, 20 minutes seemed interminable, and today I couldn't believe it when she said we were on the last circuit. I was convinced there had to be 5 more!

I feel better, stronger and healthier already. Though I hadn't watched her shows, I had heard bad things about JM, but I found her to be very positive and encouraging, without being a complete irritation (and her voice isn't nearly as annoying as some others. Denise Austin, for one, drives me up a tree.) I also love that she doesn't smile like an idiot through this and keeps saying, ""this is HARD."" Yes, it is. Thank you for acknowledging the fact!

If you're a beginner, and you're scared, give this a try. The instant download is a really good deal, and for me made it doable, knowing I can take my laptop anywhere to work out made it worth doing. And do it the next day, even though you're sore. You deserve it!

I feel so good, I think I'll treat myself to some new gym shoes. I think I'm going to need them! Thank you, Jillian!",1358899200,2,2489,4.022267206477733

I was prepared for a tough workout but nothing prepared me for what happened 5 minutes into the workout. I was doing lunges making sure I was in proper form. Basically that my knee was not over my toes. I am not sure what happened but next thing I know I topple over and my knee pops out of joint. No one else was home so I had to put it back in joint.  Very painful!!! Had to wear a knee brace. Took about 6 weeks to recover to the point where I could not rely on someone else to help me get up or where I could kneel on the floor without it hurting.

3320481,5,B00127RAJY,"I have to say that Jillian has kicked my butt..  9 months ago i weighed 160 pounds.  I now weigh 120.  I started running and dieting and lost the weight within 6 months.. I then bought the jillian micheals 30 day shred.  I not only was able to maintain my weight during the winter but I became thinner because I was losing fat and building muscles.  Now I am 5 foot 2 inches, so 120 pounds looks like a litter more on my short stubby body but i feel as if im in great shape.  I am able to do things I was never able to do before.  Not all of this was because of Jillian I lost the weight from running and dieting, but I got in shape with Jillian.  Not to mention where I live November-March I would freeze outside running and I get bored with my tredmill.  I belive counting out the 30 seconds on the reps really really helps with finishing the cardio.  Whatever you do don't stop, don't skip, don't wimp out.

It's worth it tho, def recommend for everyone; beginners, intermediate and advanced bc you can take it at your own pace for all the movements so you can make it as intense as you like. I personally keep jumping in place or running in place while she explains the next move so my heart rate keeps going. Can't wait to try out her other DVDs too!!",1358294400,,514,4.0

It made my knees and my back hurt terribly. I got bored with the workouts quickly and felt absolutely zero desire to ever put myself through that agony again.

I started doing this DVD last week, I'm still on Level 1. This DVD is tough but you can do it! The interval training is a proven method that I love - you don't get bored and you have to push yourself through. The DVD is split up into three Levels - 1,2 and 3. Each level contains three circuits and each circuit contains 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and a 1 minute of abs. The goal is to go through the workout that is a full 20 minutes WITHOUT stopping. I just now have gotten down to only taking two 5 seconds breaks and I""m super out of shape, so it really does help. I purchased 3 other Jillian DVDS after I got hers. I love them. You will see results if you do the exercises seriously, push yourself and keep up with it. I feel amazing, have so much more energy and my plan in the summer will be to start doing CrossFit training thanks to Jillian!",1358208000,,994,4.076530612244898
3320488,5,B00127RAJY,"After returning to work following the birth of my daughter, I had a couple of pretty sedentary weeks because it was really hard to find the time to exercise.  This video is a great solution.  I can do it after putting the baby to bed or sometimes even while she plays nearby.  I have been doing the first level.  I find the cardio and abs easy but the strength moves very challenging, probably because I did a lot of jogging during my first few months post-partum, but even with the not-too-tough cardio I do get a decent sweat going.  I'm interested to see if the cardio/ab circuits get much harder in levels 2 and 3, which would really make this an amazing workout.  Even level 1 is an awesome workout when combined with a short run first.  I like how straightforward the video is.  You hardly need any equipment (you could use 16 oz cans for weights in a pinch) and Jillian's technique cues are helpful.  There's no wondering if you're on the wrong foot or feeling like an idiot because the moves are too complex.  I'm so glad to have this option available for really busy days and I am looking forward to checking out some of Jillian's other videos.",1358035200,3,1153,4.421800947867299

3320494,5,B00127RAJY,"I am only two days in, so I can't accurately rate the results after 30 days yet, but this workout is fantastic.  It is HARD.  It's the hardest 20 minutes that I can remember ever working out.  I had a baby 4 months ago and have a lot of baby weight to lose.  This video is great.  Because it's only 20 minutes, I can wait until I put my baby to sleep at 8, and do this quick workout.  I don't have to miss any time with him by going to the gym.  After day 2, my arms, legs and ""abs"" hurt so bad - which is especially nice to feel this burn in my stomach where I need the most help.

I know a few other new moms that do this video and they say this was the only thing that helped with the baby belly.  This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.

This is perfect for any moms of small children who don't have time to go to the gym, or anyone who is under time constraints of any kind.

I should also mention that I am obviously only doing the beginner workout right now, and I can barely get through that.  I can only imagine how challenging the other two workouts are.  I am coming from pregnancy and being completely sedentary, but back in the day I used to workout a LOT, so I do think I know a good workout when I see one.

I definitely recommend giving this a try.  I will try to remember to update my review after I complete the 30 days.

I will say, the commentary at the beginning and the fact that you can't fast forward through it, is annoying as some other reviewers said.  My solution - turn on the DVD and hit play, then go get ""ready"" (fill up water, change clothes, put baby to bed).  By the time you come back, the commentary is over & you're ready to go.  Annoying yes, dealbreaker, absolutely not.",1357862400,9,1747,3.9971098265895955

I will say though that I have not done it long enough to notice any difference in weight or inches, but I love that my endurance seems to be getting better and better every time I do it.

I'm a stay at home - work at home mom of 2 with a busy husband and don't have time for long work outs. But since I work at home sitting at the computer most days I really needed something with cardio plus strength training.

You will notice the changes in yourself, each time you do the work out.  i could not do a regular push up at the beginning of my ""training"" and was so pleased to get the strength as I worked out.  be sure to push yourself, you might not know you can do it until you try.

I love this workout!",1357171200,4,273,4.074074074074074
3320523,5,B00127RAJY,"I am new to the workout scene - approaching 40 and I ""just haven't had time"" for all these years. It's an excuse a lot of people use, but it really is true. I truly do not know where I would find the extra time in a day or even in a week to change clothes, drive to a gym, do a workout, drive home, etc.  A co-worker mentioned that she just gets up a little earlier and works out at home and I had an epiphany. Why couldn't I do that?

So, for the last 3 months, I've been getting up 45 min-1 hour earlier and working out. I started with some DVDs I got at the local big box store - dance/aerobics/zumba type DVDs that were fun, but I found myself skipping some of the routines because they were just too long.

I did a search on Amazon and Jillian's videos popped up immediately. When I heard 20 minutes, I was eager to try it. I'm SO glad I did. The 30 Day Shred is not easy, but it's not so difficult that a beginner can't do it. The first time around I tried to progress to level 2 a little too quickly and ended up hurting my knee. I took a break over Thanksgiving, did some research about form, and started over. I often follow the beginner/modified assistant, but I am still seeing results and I feel great the whole day long.

I really like the structure of this workout. I also have some of the Biggest Loser DVDs, but they seem kind of loose and disorganized compared to 30 Day Shred. It's nice to see the Biggest Loser contestants doing the workouts and struggling (like me!) but I really like the professionals on Jillian's video so I know the right way to do the moves.

I have finished the 30 Day Shred (lost 7 pounds in 30 days!) and I've moved on to Ripped in 30, which is very similar. I was nervous about Ripped in 30 because I loved the 30 DS so much, but so far I like it a lot, too. If you are pressed for time (or even if you aren't) but you want to tone up and feel good, Jillian's videos are definitely the way to go.",1357171200,2,1941,4.018134715025907

3320525,3,B00127RAJY,"First of all, let me say that this is a good, sound workout.  If you're looking for something relatively short that will get your heart rate up and works most of your muscles this is a fine program.  You could do a lot worse.

My biggest gripe with the whole thing is the ""20 pounds in 30 days claim"".

I'm a 300 pound guy.  Out of shape yes, obese no.  I can still run a 30 minute 5k at my weight.  I burn about 300 calories doing this work out.  A pound of fat takes 3500 calories to burn off.  If I DIDN'T EAT FOR A MONTH I wouldn't lose 30 in a month, whether I did this program or not.  If you think you can get a 3500 calorie a day caloric deficit go for it.  But you can't.  Most people will burn about 200 calories doing this program, on top of a base rate of about 2000.  If you cut to a 1500 calorie a day diet you can expect to lose about 8 pounds in 30 days.

Don't let the outrageous claim turn you off, it's still a good program.  Just understand that it's impossible to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without going on a hunger strike.",1357171200,3,1044,3.881516587677725

I really like that the workouts are only about 20 minutes long, which makes it really easy to fit into my schedule. I've noticed that I'm a little stronger now after a few weeks. I'd recommend this DVD.",1356652800,,463,4.087912087912088

Level 2 & Level 3 are serious butt kickers, and on mornings where I accidentally sleep in or have an early meeting, I can put this in for 20 minutes and I don't feel like a slug for the rest of the day (how I feel if I don't work out).

We are currently on day 3 and although the workouts are tough, we are feeling great! We already have more energy and are feeling better about ourselves. We are a great motivator for each other we hope for great results! Jillian is a great motivator and this workout is intense, but fabulous.

I am a nurse in a cardiac intensive care unit. I don't want to be a hypocrite and look at my patients after they have had open heart surgery and tell them they need to make some lifestyle changes when I haven't done them myself. I always told myself that I would never get to that point but I am heading there and fast. I'm hoping Jillian can help me lose the 3 pants I have gained since graduating nursing school 3 years ago so I can not only better take care of my patients, but be an example to them.

I will keep everyone posted on my progress as I continue this journey!

1/11/13
So, I am 2 weeks in to the 30 day shred. Since I have a history of knee problems I did level 1 for 2 weeks instead of 10 days and I always follow Anita in the exercises. Today started level 2 and although it is super tough, I still feel great!

I am not one for weighing myself, but I have gone down one pants size since starting. I love that I am seeing results but I feel even better because I feel better! I work night shift and always seem to be low on energy on my days off...that has definitely changed and I am definitely getting more accomplished on my days off!",1356393600,6,1576,4.107142857142857

3320578,3,B00127RAJY,"I bought these videos because I wanted to try and work out over my winter break--I wasn't expecting miracles in 30 days, but I trusted the name and liked that the videos were only 20-30 minutes so it wouldn't eat up too much time.

However, they are a bit too intense for me. I am in pretty bad shape, I am only 20 but I am overweight and I don't exercise very regularly at all. I was only able to get through the first workout for two days--they were pretty hard and I was sore after, but today my knees are in a lot of pain and keep giving out when I walk. I am hoping that the pain will subside in a few days and that I haven't given myself a long term injury. My own fault, I should have gone slower and paid more attention to my form, but still.

Pros:

-very short
-does provide a good workout
-exercises are straight forward and easy to follow
-good quality videos as far as pace, music, trainer commentary

Cons:

-not great for beginners
-doesn't spend enough time on each exercise to get the form right
-the commentary was very good at encouragement, but I feel like it made it seem like slowing down or modifying the exercises more was entirely unnecessary. Probably to make good on the 30 day claim, but not necessary for just improving overall fitness at a slower pace. Mostly my bad, just be careful not to hurt yourself if you aren't in the best shape.",1355875200,2,1367,4.262548262548263

I am now able to complete the first workout AND walk just fine the next day! I have noticed my endurance and stamina improving!

I am about 50 pounds overweight, and not naturally athletic! Infact, other than dancing in high school, I have always hated working out! But Jillian has such a good personality and she really pushes you and makes you think! Just when you want to give up, she tells you ""you can do it!"" ""If 400 pd people can do jumping jacks so can you!"" And that runs through my head each time I do them, because instead of getting tired and stopping I think that if they can do it so can I!!!

3320590,5,B00127RAJY,"I use this video multiple times a week! This is my go to video when I want a great cardio workout. Jillian uses high intensity interval training which keeps you switching things up between cardio and muscle building so it's never boring. This video has three levels, level one is great for beginning working out. If you're just getting back into the groove then buy this video! You can work your way up to level two and then three when you're ready. The moves are quite basic and would be easy even if you're battling with losing a lot of weight right now. All you need are some weights! I use two pound weights, they are just enough to get my muscles working. I have a bunch of Jillian's videos, but this is always my go-to video when I want some cardio! If I really want to workout, but I don't want to kill myself I will do level one, if I am feeling like a really need a beating then I'll go to level two or three.

3320594,4,B00127RAJY,"Its been quite some time since I last did this workout...(I just repurchased because of how my first time using it went!) So let me give you a bit of background.  Please stay with me...the extra information is quite a bit, but I feel that it counts toward the review's final say! Hope it helps!

(Back in 2008) My first time using it, I was about 25 pounds over my allowable weight.  I had a lot of ""icky"" stuff going on in my life and I was overeating...plus I was national guard working at the MEPS, an active duty location.  Weight was VERY important.  So I had to get it together! I purchased the book first and then read some reviews about this dvd so I purchased it.  IT WAS OUTSTANDING.  I am always up for a challenge, this was more or less my home workout gateway.

It was short enough for me not to get bored...it was challenging to the point where I started competing against myself, but not overly so where one would become discouraged.  SO...I can say that there is a good balance when it comes to this dvd.  The recipes in the book and the written guidance helped me with my diet as well. I dropped that 25 pounds plus a few more and then I was motivated to start running.  I paired this dvd with my running and my body was nicely toned!(seriously...I looked better than I did in high school...and I had a 4 year old at the time!)  Eventually I graduated beyond this dvd and was able to take what I learned in the dvd and other things I picked up along the way regarding fitness to keep my body at my target weight.

(In 2010) I was injured overseas in a rocket attack that among quite a few injuries took a large chunk of muscle out of my right thigh.  During the healing process I was only able to do Jillian's Yoga Meltdown dvd which was another great buy...(I recommend that!) It was the start for me to get back on my feet I was back to running about 7-8 months after my injury.  After that I was able to go back to my fitness knowledge to maintain my body.  (are you seeing a pattern yet?!)

(In 2011-2012)  During my recent pregnancy I was unable to work out because of the physical pain I was in due to my previous trauma injuries.  Now I am recovering from a hernia repair....I will be cleared to exercise in 2 more weeks.

(In...NOW) SO...here I am today about 5 months postpartum and 2 weeks away from medical release (to exercise) and I purchased her dvd yet again. (I loaned it to a friend when I ""graduated"" to other fitness options and never got it back OR I would TOTALLY still have it.  I won't be loaning this baby out again!!!!-lesson learned)

I SAID ALL THAT TO SAY:  Jillian's workout methods WORK.  As long as you remain determined, push through, do it those 5-6 times a week(basically remain consistent), and make some changes to your diet...the weight can be lost! I like her because she promotes not accepting excuses.  The exercises target the key areas and ramp up your heart rate when you really put your ALL into it.  A person only gets out what they put in!

This is a great starter dvd for someone looking to get their body on point.  It's not intimidating or boring.  I have done P90X and during my deployment I did some of the Insanity workout(before I got hurt) and those workouts ARE GREAT AS WELL...BUT may be intimidating or scary to someone that is just starting, trying to ease back into working out, or have injuries that prohibit them from doing the exercises fully even WITH the modifications.  Even though Jillian Michaels has a lot of Plyo(jump training) in her workouts...there is a way to modify if necessary and still reap the benefits especially if coupled with other methods of fitness.

This dvd is one that should remain in your collection.  It has been a doorway for me when most needed while providing me with basic knowledge of what makes noticeable change in my body. Don't compare it to Insanity or P90X...those workouts are in their own separate category.  I mean beachbody alone (the company those fall under) are in a category of their own...so just give Jillian her credit where it is do!

SOOOOO  I believe you should just press the button.  You know which button Im talking about right?  The buy/purchase button.  PUT IT IN YOUR CART!!! I'm serious!!! Just do it...give it a go.  NOW GO GET FIT!!!! :-)",1355443200,4,4279,4.409438775510204

The video features both advanced and simplified versions of most of the exercises, and if you follow the timeline, you really can work your way up to the advanced workout. I wish it had better music, but they wouldn't be able to sell it at this price if they had to license anything worth listening to.

The best tip I can offer is DO NOT give up! Each workout is broken down into three parts. When you finish the first part, you will not know how you can do it two more time. That's okay. You'll figure it out, and by the time you get to the third round, you'll be able to power through. Start with the regular moves and step down to the simpler modifications if you need to.",1355356800,,724,4.134751773049645
3320598,5,B00127RAJY,"...and you will love her for it. This 20 minute workout is intense but not so much so that you're dead. You still feel like you've had an hour long workout. Jillian focuses on combination strength moves. She works you through a warm-up, 3 rounds of 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, and 1 minute of abs, and a cool down. I did this for a week and already saw results: more toned abs, more toned arbs, cardio improved.

Jillian is also very encouraging. You don't even realize it, but when you're trying to get those last reps in and want to give up, she reminds you to keep going. When the workout is only 20 minutes, every minute counts.

I definitely recommend the DVD for anyone who needs a quick workout and wants all over results.",1355270400,,739,4.386861313868613

Caveat:  I've only done Day One of Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred at Level I. I'm not in the best of shape but not in the worst either and this was deceptively difficult. Easy moves done enough to make it hard. The few muscles I have have now turned to Jello. Impressive. And only 20 minutes and she keeps you motivated to keep going. Usually I get bored and turn videos off but in this case because nothing was excruciating or contorted or just too slow or boring, I kept on through it.  And about half way in the burn started and my legs were a bit wobbly.

This is old school calisthetics and basic gym aerobics put together by a professional in a way that really makes your body work.  Push ups, jumping jacks, crunches, combined with minor weights.  Sounds deceptively simple and easy...but I think that's probably the beauty of it is that it is simple...and seems easy at first...but quickly becomes muscle fatiguing and gets your heart rate going.  And that's all you want in a good workout.

I'm excited for Day Two....",1355184000,,1221,4.468468468468468

I always sticks with hers as hers seem to have the best results.  What I love is that she has a realistic approach and doesn't say cheesy things in her work outs.  I work out 4- 5 days a week and Jillian's dvd's still make my heart pound and burn away my unwanted calories.  I highly recommend Jillian's work outs if you haven't tried them.

This is one of the few workouts I have done that is less than 30 minutes, but feels like a 60 minute workout!  If you want a quick workout that gets results, this is it.  As the workouts got easier, I started doing two of the workouts in one day - one in the morning and one at night - levels 2 and 3 are my favorite as level 1 seems too easy now.

Has different videos for different levels of fitness (3)
Just have a mat and weights and you are ready to go
Great for toning
Cheap

Cons-
No number of ""reps"" to complete which can be confusing when they change camera angles and you try to keep up with the people doing the exercise.
Gets repetitive
After completing this the first time, I had to stop for a while because I was having knee issues

Overall, I'd say get it but mix it with other workout DVD's as this one can get old and has high knee impact moves.",1354924800,,520,4.19
3320613,5,B00127RAJY,"This is a great workout. I suggest having two different sets of weights on hand. I have 5 lbs and 8 lbs. One thing I recommend is adding in extra cardio with this workout. This is great for toning and keeping the heartrate up, but you definitely need more cardio. You must have a good diet plan in place as well. Track your calories, watch your sugar intake and eat extra protein since you're building up your muscles.

Don't do what I did. I'm in relatively good shape and day 1 I did level 1. Day 2 I skipped level 1 and went to level 2. I suggest waiting until level 1 starts to seem a little easy before switch to level 2.

I stopped for a week and tried to go back but had the same problem again. I've not picked it back up unfortunately because I'm afraid the same thing is going to start happening again. Instead of using this I just went and got a gym membership and lost 45 pounds that way. I loved the video the first several days and you really do feel it especially in your tummy but my goodness the pain in my shins was awful. I purchased this to help me lose baby weight and tone my stomach. I used two cans of white beans instead of weights. My 4 year old saw me doing it and went in the kitchen to grab her own campbell soup cans and did some of the exercise too. She thought it was fun. You will sweat for sure! I had my husband rip this onto his computer and stream it though the apple tv so I could do it on any of our tv's in the house while the baby slept. I have not tried level 2 or 3 out of fear for my shins which I honestly do not feel need a workout. It's my butt and tummy that need the work!",1354752000,,1125,3.853448275862069
3320617,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this video more than a year ago, and I still use it regularly. I have never stuck with a workout program this long. I like it because it features three different workouts of only 20 minutes each. I can get a challenging workout (sweat, sore muscles, heart pounding) in less than half the time of a typical workout video. Whenever I try to talk myself out of working out, I just say, ""You can do anything for 20 minutes!""

The workouts are VERY challenging, especially for beginners. The first time I did it, I could hardly walk the next day! But my body got stronger very quickly, and I was moving up to more challenging workouts in no time.

The whole ""30 day shred"" idea is not exactly true. For one thing, I don't work out every day. I think your muscles need a day's rest in between. And I wouldn't say this video has gotten me ""shredded."" I'm a 41-year-old woman with two kids. I couldn't be shredded if I could afford a full-time trainer! But I have gotten significantly stronger, and my endurance has improved tremendoulsy.

Overall, I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking for a regular workout video that is challenging and fun. If Jillian Michael's voice annoys you, there is even an option to turn off the audio and just listen to the music.",1354752000,,1282,4.47008547008547

3320619,5,B00127RAJY,great quick workout. Works most of your body parts from head to toe. Get up and just do it now.. ok,1354752000,,99,3.761904761904762
3320620,5,B00127RAJY,"I bought this back in late June/early July of 2012.  I'm a person who hasn't really worked out in over a decade since I stopped playing football in college.  I was terribly out of shape.  My problem?  Between work and children, I simply do not have the time to devote to spending over an hour working out.  It was always my belief that a person needed to devote that kind of time in order to get in shape and see a difference in their bodies. Enter ""30 Day Shred.""

I read the reviews here on Amazon, and decide to take the plunge.  I figured that worst case scenario, I get in better shape, even if I don't necessarily look it.  Anything is better than nothing right?  And for the cost of this DVD?  There was NOTHING to lose and EVERYTHING to gain.  I started with the level one workout back in early July.  Watching it, it didn't seem to difficult, but let me tell you, for someone like me who was totally out of shape, it was!

Here's the thing- It's now December, and guess what? I'm STILL doing level one.  Why?  Because I push myself to my physical limit.  Every day.  Every workout.  There's has been no need at all for me to switch up the routine.  In spite of the fact that the workout is only around 25 minutes with the warmup and cooldown, I have seen a dramatic change in my body.  I've lost my gut, and lovehandles.  I have abs!  Ones I can actually see!

For me there has been a few keys to success:

1. Do the workout everyday if you can.  I've do it almost everyday.  On average, I've probably missed one or two days per month, simply because I listen to my body, and if I'm that physically exhausted, I give it rest, however, like I said, I only do it once or twice a month, if that;
2. DO NOT SLACK OFF when doing the workout.  Like Jillian says, it's a short workout so you need to push yourself.  For example, I do 3 jumping jacks for every two the models do; During each 30 second punching portion of cardio, I do anywhere from 50 to 60+ punches.  You can do it too, you just have to will yourself to do so, even on days where you're tired and you're not in the mood to move, let alone workout.  No one can make you push yourself but you, and when we're talking about a measily 25 minutes of your day, there's no excuse to not do it;
3.  You obviously need to eat better.  What I've done is cut out the white carbs from my diet as much as possible, and I try to avoid sugars and carbs when I can.  I still eat them, don't get me wrong- and your body needs them, just try and eat brown cabs with fiber when you can.  Yes, I eat pizza, ice cream, and candy, but I don't do it everyday, and pig out.

I'm so happy with the success I've had doing 1/3 of this inexpensive, 25 minute workout DVD.  I don't know how much weight I've lost, but I definitely have, as I've gone from 36 inch waist to about a 31 inch waist, where I can see my abs- something I didn't think would be possible in my lifetime, and something that was never an expectation I had going into this.  If I knew I could invest such little time and get such great results, I would have done this YEARS ago.  I believe in this workout so much I went ahead and bought another copy for my parents and I'm convincing them to do the modified exercises, and do what they can because anything is better then nothing.  If you get this DVD good luck with it.  Follow my advice and you will see results.",1354752000,6,3376,4.094656488549618

I started this video 3 days ago with the intention to get toned, and lose a few pounds. I am very out of shape. I rarely exercise, so doing this was a shock. Day one, I was exhausted, out of breath, and almost passed out. It was so intense and it was level one! I also used 5 pound weights, when I probably should have used less. The next day, I weighed myself, and saw I lost 2 pounds already! I was in such a happy mood, that I decided to jump right up to level 2! Ha well that was a mistake, and I thought level 1 was hard! It was insane! I couldn't do half the moves, but worked out as much as I could! Afterwards, I was soooo sore! I couldn't walk up or down stairs, couldn't move my arms a certain way, etc. I was in such pain, and still am! Now i'm only on day 3, I went back to level 1, and I really see a difference in my body already! My thighs are becoming less flabby. My arms are becoming more muscular.

I have really noticed an improvement in my core strength since discovering this and other Jillian workouts a year ago.  I used to wake up every morning with a sore lower back and struggled through the pain to run and walk for exercise.  After diligently working out with Jillian 6 days per week for a year, I now have a strong core and lower back, and I am pain free.  I never thought I could actually do back strengthening exercises in addition to ab work, but now I can do Supermans with the rest of 'em!  My advice to other back pain sufferers is to stick with it -- modify exercises as needed in the beginning as you are building core strength.  There were several exercises I couldn't do or had to modify in the beginning because of my back pain (Supermans were out of the question), but I can do them now thanks to all those ab exercises and planks.

I couldn't get through the crawl push ups; killer.  Now I am doing week 2 and guess what?  Amazing things are happening!  I wake up in the morning with a zing! Not a struggle to sit up and get out of bed.  Running up a flight of stairs at the school I work at is much easier. I actually have more energy than the kids!

I don't do it in 30 days - I use the DVD 3 times a week and alternate it with yoga or running. There isn't much stretching for warm up or for a cool down, so even though its a 20 minute work out and a 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down, I generally take about 40 with the stretching.

8244481,1,B00127RAJY,I don't think this video is for people that aren't very fit. I've tried it off and on for a few years (in my mid 20s) and twice I've damaged my lower back so bad that I could barely move. Level 1 also makes my shins sore. I've never experienced this with any other workouts. I prefer Ellen Barrett videos or the treadmill.,1525824000,,322,4.126984126984127
