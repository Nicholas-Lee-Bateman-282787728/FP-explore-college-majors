4594474,3,B00579FVYE,Rosalind Russell comedies are always fun to watch; but this plot and script is weak.  The movie is amusing and will provide something to watch when bored; but it is not worth the $2.99 for instant viewing.  Some of these older lesser-known films should be offered at 99 cents.,1407974400,4,276,4.612244897959184
4594475,4,B00579FVYE,"Love the classics , this was nice Russell is always good, as is Cummings. Love to watching old movies especially comedies and love stories and not worry about fast forwarding...",1387756800,3,177,4.933333333333334
4594476,3,B00579FVYE,"If you like the old screwball comedies and Rosalind Russell's voice you will love this movie. She and her husband have just been divorced but he is trying desperately to win her back. The woman who was the cause of the divorce (a beautiful blonde) and Rosalind's interfering uncle keep popping in every time it seems they are back on solid ground. Funny (predictable) circumstances, fast moving, silliness. I love watching the old movies if you like reminiscing about the fifties, checking out the fashions and hearing the music. This one is enjoyable but with only two main characters, a little tiring by the end.",1379116800,3,614,4.857142857142857
4594477,5,B00579FVYE,"Russell at her best, comedy with romance! Robert Cummings is excellent as the ex-husband trying to get Russell back in this zany comedy. Enjoy Hollywood in its finest decade.

8460406,4,B00579FVYE,"If you like Rosalind Russell (and I do), you'll like this movie. She's smart--she's the judge to tell it to--glamorous, funny and fearless--she gets completely drenched, with no complaints. Even though there are still jibes about staying home like a good wife, she holds her own, determined to be a judge. I thought the movie was a lot of fun.",1477958400,,343,4.733333333333333
