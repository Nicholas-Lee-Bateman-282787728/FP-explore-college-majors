3465821,5,B001AR0D1I,"Our children have watched this DVD a few times and quote lines from it, scripture, and in a short time have applied the lessons learned - priceless.  If they begin having an issue related to the teaching in the DVD, one of them will remind the other about what the story said and they will discuss what to do - mind you, these are two little boys under the age of seven!!!  Other reviewers have added great detail about the video itself.  All I can say is I wish they were making as many of these as they have VeggieTales.",1240704000,,522,4.2
3465822,5,B001AR0D1I,"It's nice to see a cartoon that is funny, exciting, and teaches often neglected but valuable lessons, not only to children, but to adults.

There is flagrant religious foundations, but that doesn't bother me at all, despite me not being religious. The lessons in humility can be useful to anyone of any belief.

This toon (well at least this DVD) blows away the terrible and useless cartoons these days.",1233705600,,403,4.826086956521739
3465823,5,B001AR0D1I,"I got this DVD in the mail today and I was sooooooo excited! I LOVE 3-2-1 Penguins! This DVD has 3 cool episodes on it.

""The Green-Eyed Monster""
This episode is about envy. Michelle is jealous because Jason's room is a tiny bit bigger than hers. They land on a planet called Picket, where it is divided by a picket fence, and the sheep who inhabit the planet are arguing on who has the greener grass, and even when they switch sides, they still think the other side is greener. Suddenly, a green-eyed monster appears, and begins to eat everything.

""More Is More""
This episode is about over doing it. Kevin and Jason get addicted to a new cereal called Sugar Frosted Black Holes. They land on a planet called Gutt and it has a strong gravitational field. The people of this planet have become gluttons. And now, a huge space twister threatens to suck the planet into nothing.

""Give and Let Give""
This is an episode about sharing. Michelle doesn't want to share the cupcakes she made with Jason. She gives everyone one, excluding him.
They land on the desert planet of Share-a-Like that is suffering a draught. The flamingos and garden gnomes there are about to rage war over each other about water rights.

All 3 of these episodes are fantastic. They're entertaining, hilarious, and teaches you a good lesson. Don't think you're too old for a show like this. I'm 16, and this is one of my top fave shows. I love the imagination, the humor, and the wonderful lessons you learn, which really makes you think and take to heart. Buy this, I promise, you won't regret it!",1232409600,6,1568,4.549645390070922
3465824,5,B001AR0D1I,"Really enjoy this new addition to the Penguins collection.  This was a better bargain as well because there is more than one episode on this video.  Thanks for another quality product that is not only safe for my kids to watch, but enjoyable for the whole family, and a good value to learn.",1231804800,,290,4.452830188679245
3465825,5,B001AR0D1I,"This is our first 321 Penguin product and both of my boys, 3 and 5, love it.  I love that each episode has a lesson (forgiveness, envy, gluttony) that is related to God and the Bible.  I would highly recommend this dvd and I like this better than Veggie Tales.",1231545600,,260,4.18
3465826,5,B001AR0D1I,"We purchased the new DVD, ""3-2-1 Penguins: Save the Planets.""  This is the first new release of 3-2-1 Penguins since Big Idea Productions was acquired by Classic Media.

We liked the three episodes that you can play all at once.  It sounds like they got new actors to do the voices of Michelle, and Captain Zidgel.  They follow the same formula as previous episodes with Jason and Michelle praying at their bedside at the end of the day, prompted by the lessons they have learned in their most recent space adventure.  The three new adventures don't have musical epilogs like the previous episodes but we liked them.

We have all six previous episodes on DVD and they are all very short.  We have to do a lot of DVD player attendance to play three episodes in a row.  Big Idea needs to re-release the six previous episodes on two separate DVD product releases, three episodes per DVD with a ""Play All"" option on the DVD menu.",1220832000,7,925,4.530120481927711
3465827,5,B001AR0D1I,"This was a good buy. The DVD contains 3 separate episodes, which is new for 3-2-1 Penguins.

The first one is ""More is More"" which I loved. The children (Jason and his twin sister Michelle) are interested in a sugary cereal called Sugar Frosted Black Holes, but get called away on a mission with their friends the Penguins. They're called to a planet Gutt because its gravitational field isn't working properly. On the way to the planet, they come across some of the cereal, and Jason and Kevin become addicted. Even though they are full, they want more. Once the penguins arrive at the planet, they see that the leader of the planet has put on a lot of weight compared to his picture on the wall. He has also been eating the sugary cereal. His home is also covered with video games. Michelle comments that it just seems like too much, and she's waiting for a lesson from Saul. Jason figures out that sugar in the cereal is the cause of the gravitational imbalance, and as soon as everyone says ""I've had enough"" balance is restored. It is a great lesson in gluttony, excess, and self-control. I especially liked the fact that a sugary cereal was at the base of all the problems.

The next one is ""The Green-Eyed Monster"" which of course is about envy and jealousy. It starts with Michelle being jealous that Jason's room is .05 meters bigger than hers. This is how they normally set up the story, a problem at home for the children gets played out in the Penguins mission. In this case they visit a planet of sheep, and boy does the captain make a fool out of himself when he meets them! ""It's nice to meet ewe. Do you get it E-W-E?"" and of course he just won't drop it. There is a fence dividing the land, and the sheep on both sides think the other side's grass is greener. Even after they switch sides, the still believe the other side is greener. Then a real green eyed monster appears and is destroying everything. Michelle discovers that you have to be grateful for what you have to get rid of the monster.

The last one is ""Give and Let Give"" which is the story of yard art fighting over a pond. Pink flamingos and garden gnomes, the message here is sharing.

If you're new to 3-2-1 Penguins, they are wonderful. The animation is beautiful, with rich colors, and a three dimensional appearance. The penguins are hysterical, and the messages are meaningful, yet simple enough for a child to understand. Often a Bible verse is used to back up the moral of the story. They are done by the same people who do Veggie Tales, only now everybody has hands.",1220486400,13,2556,4.455128205128205
