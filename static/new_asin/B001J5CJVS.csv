8311955,5,B001J5CJVS,"I love his voice and his songs.  He sings like an Angel !  I especially like
""goodby my love goodby"".  I think of my younger brother who died.  He looked so much like Demis Roussos.",1367539200,,181,4.085714285714285
8311956,2,B001J5CJVS,"Demis Roussos has a beautiful voice and sings many lovely songs, but the quality of this disk is very poor. You must turn the sound up as high as possible in order to hear and understand any thing. Would not recommend this to any one. Perhaps his others are better quality.",1361059200,,273,4.372549019607843
8311957,5,B001J5CJVS,"Demis Roussos was my very favorite singer of my young age. Later on I did not hear him that much and his songs were overlapped by other popular songs and to me he was almost forgotten... until a beautiful .pps with his voice on backgound brought him back to me. What a beautiful voice and great ""evergreen"" songs. Where was I all those years? So, I purchased his music and since now on he will sing for me anytime it my heart desires...",1341619200,,436,4.265060240963855
