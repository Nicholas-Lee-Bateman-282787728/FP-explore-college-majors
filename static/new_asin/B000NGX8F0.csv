8177591,5,B000NGX8F0,"Im half Jewish, but this documentary is not just a smear campaign against the Nazis. The German film makers tried present the war as palatable, such as with no battle or concentration camp scenes. In fact, one film tried to justify the camps by showing how many other countries had used them, like the USA, Russia, and South Africa during the Boar War. The Nazi party was genuinely  discrete about the whole situation. This speakes volumes about the mood of the German people.

Whats fascinating is how the films showed that the German people had no stomach for war. It was very sanitized by using earlier German history to allude and justify the present German army. The German people are not shown as full of blood lust, but as genuinely distressed by even language differences. This is the norm in history and around the world today. These films prove the book title No Hitler, no Holocaust, and disprove the book title, Hitlers Willing Executioners.

A former German solder said the war was not fought for the Nazis but for the sovereignty of Germany. You see this clearly in these film clips. The films make the war about the German people and country and not the Nazi party. Recall how its common for people today to think that the Nazis were just an extension of a sick German people. We should keep in mind that nationalism had  swept all of Europe from about 1820. And European countries had been in almost constant war since about 1300. So, outside of the plans to exterminate the Slavs and Jews, the Nazi party wasn't doing anything bizar. Europe had all ways been a tinder box, and WW II was just the most recent flare up of centuries long animosities.",1525478400,,1664,4.6305084745762715

8177596,4,B000NGX8F0,"Duestchland Erwache, is not as presented .In this, the english language edition there is some massaging, and a slant toward showing the evil of the Nazis'. Of course this was done during the war years and is a legitimate strategy to extra-villify the enemy. In retrospect it would be better to have the original as made with english sub-titling for a true historical perspective. Hence the 4 star rating of this version. As to content I have nothing to say it is what it is. Production value is okay. The rendering as with all IHF products is superb.",1374883200,12,550,4.622448979591836
8177597,5,B000NGX8F0,This  is a great preview of very important German films never  before made available to the American public.  Finally I was able to watich a brief introduction to the films Dr. gobbels was made so notorous for making.  By today's  standards these films are very tame and should be allowed to be show in their entirety in America.  Americans of German ancestry in particular need to see them.,1370476800,10,391,4.676470588235294
