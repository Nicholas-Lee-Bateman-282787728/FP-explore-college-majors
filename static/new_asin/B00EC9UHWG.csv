5901667,1,B00EC9UHWG,"I have purchased sets of DVDs before, and love how they have been packaged.  You do not get this with this set.  It is also disappointing that the original music has been replaced with music I've never heard before.  In the slumber party scene, you see the girls lip syncing to Mony Mony while some strange song plays in the background.  In the episode Fire and Ice, when Brandon and be figure skater skate to I've had the Time of My Life, some random, not romantic fast song plays.  In the end, I am disappointed that I spent the amount of money to not have the original series, and the music was a big part of the original series.",1357171200,74,632,4.277310924369748
5901668,5,B00EC9UHWG,"I am a big huge fan for 90210 I know every episode, I just DON'T get sick of watching these DVD  Eric and over, actually I love to watch and I see and catch things that I did not see in the past. Now I have my 14 year old Daughter hooked on it.",1353715200,,244,3.5185185185185186
5901669,5,B00EC9UHWG,It seems the bad reviews are old because this certainly is a box set! I love the set and it makes it so easy to keep all the dvd's together! Great show also.,1343433600,3,157,3.787878787878788
5901670,1,B00EC9UHWG,"Dear Fans,

Remember when Dylan and Brenda broke up in season three and Brenda listened to ""Losing My Religion"" on a loop?  Yeah.  Well if you buy these dvds, you won't be hearing that.  Remember when Kelly and Dylan spent the night on the beach, also in season 3, and Sophie B. Hawkins, ""Damn I wish I was your lover"" played in the background.  That's gone too.

So is ""Can't Cry Hard Enough"" when Dylan sees himself as a child after his dad ""dies.""  So is Guns n Roses' ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" after Scott dies in season 2.  So is ""Nobody Knows Me"" by Lyle Lovett after Antonia dies in season six.  So is ""Graduation Day"" by Chris Isaak in the beginning of Graduation Day in the season 7 finale.  So is ""Living in a Fantasy"" by the Rainbow Band when David starts using drugs in season four.

You get the gist here?  Every song that you relate to this series has been taken from you through these dvds.  In Slumber Party in season one, the girls still sing to ""Mony Mony"" but the music playing in the background is different.  In season one's Perfect Mom, entire scenes have been removed because Jim Walsh originally plays keyboard throughout this episode.  And this trend only increases significantly throughout the series when the dvds begin to feature entire episodes that have been heavily edited from their original broadcasts. The edits are so extensive that they even cut the rush song in season four because the rights to ""Que Sera Sera"" weren't acquired. This practice saves CBS money at your expense.

By not buying these dvds, you can send a message to CBS that it's not ok with us, the fans of the show, that they're profiting on these altered dvds and that they have tricked us into spending a great deal of money on cheap imitations of one of FOX's longest running series. If you love this show, please do not purchase this item.  Other studios and merchandisers have dealt with the music licensing issue in a much more appropriate and considerate manner by replacing songs that could not be cleared with other songs that correspond to the scenes and fall within the time period.  In these dvds however, CBS has without prejudice, replaced all of the music with in-house muzak that has never been heard since and will never be heard again.  This show and the people who worked on it deserve better than this.

Please join me in boycotting these dvds and instead watch the show when it airs on SoapNet (starting with episode one as of yesterday) or even buy pirated dvds from websites like sell.com.  The people who did this don't deserve to profit on this release, and us fans do not deserve to be taken advantage of this way, especially when CBS was not willing to spend a little more money to make this a quality product for us.

Sincerely,

A 90210-er for life.

5901672,3,B00EC9UHWG,"The DVDs are fine but this isn't really a 10-season box set, per se.  Instead, its 10, individual 1-season box sets that are all different shapes, sizes and package types.  It's essentially a supremely cheap bundling together of the individual seasons, as they were released over time.  For devout fans of 90210, who waited to purchase the entire series all at once, you're going to be somewhat disappointed that the set isn't more of an actual set.  There's no outer sleeve to hold all the indivdual box sets, no series notes, no compendium, no unifying art direction . . . absolutely nothing to indicate, once you remove the plastic the sets are wrapped in, that the individual seasons are all part of the same set.  So, if you want the discs, go for it, but if you're looking for that truly special commemorative box set of the iconic series, this definitely isn't it.",1297728000,95,871,4.666666666666667

The screen is not as clear do too it was from the 90s so the filming is from the 90s but still pretty good picture .

5901724,5,B00EC9UHWG,I read all the reviews about the music and packaging but read enough that made me give it a try. I really wanted to watch them whenever and was tired of renting from Netflix one disc at a time. I'm only on Season 4 but have had no problems and don't know notice the music at all. I can't wait to keep watching.,1472342400,,310,3.9365079365079363

5901733,1,B00EC9UHWG,"Not only is the original music missing, but I also noticed that all the performances by Jamie Walters/Ray Pruitt are missing as well. It's obvious in the last episode of season 5 when he tries to get Donna back. This is by no means Amazons fault, they didn't make the DVDs. But I'd rather buy this from someone who ripped them off of the tv. At least then it would be complete.",1462665600,4,377,4.25

5901756,1,B00EC9UHWG,"I am very disappointed in this so called ""Complete Series""! For one all the music is replaced with unknown songs or even worse elevator music. Second, it has clearly been edited. If this were in fact the complete series no scenes would be cut and no episodes would be missing and the original music would be on here. I am a die hard BH90210 fan and this is just ridiculous! At the price you pay for this you should get the entire show with no editing!!!

5901762,3,B00EC9UHWG,"I knew that this was an old show.  I had heard so much about it and had always wanted to know what it was all about.  Compared to shows written in this era, the storylines  are so naive.  The resolutions to whatever the issue is with the episode are either nonexistent or poor or just plain stupid.  Yet I find myself watching the shows and liking the characters.

5901771,1,B00EC9UHWG,"Pretty pricey considering it's edited and much of the music has been replaced by elevator music. Kinda of a sad joke. Everyone from the TV studio to many of the music studios should all be equally ashamed.

The TV studio didn't even try in this case and probably was a bit cheap. I mean they didn't even begin to try in this case. One of the worst jobs done.

And the music studios notoriously demand fairly unreasonable amounts for home distribution. How come every new TV series hits home release at a normal price, but the DVD sets where they forced them to pay for more rights come in at like 4x the price? The music studios seem outrageously greedy to me. It's a joke. Nobody wins. The TV studios sell less copies or deal with angry fans. The music studios drive people to piracy and, if they don't make a reasonable deal, end up getting zero dollars instead of some reasonable amount.

It's a sad, greedy state of affairs we are in.

Imagine if it was re-transferred from original elements to blu-ray and had all the original music and no scenes cut?

At the least it needed to have all (or 96%) of the music and nothing cut, if it at least delivered that I'd get it as DVD format.

As it is, with muzak nonsense and edits, forget it, there is no way I'd pay for something like that.",1411257600,6,1289,4.327800829875518

I think the packaging is fine.  Its not going to be packaged in gold.  The one thing I am disapointed in was the music.  I understand they didn't have the license to keep the original music but I feel somehow they could have paid to keep the license and charged a little more.  All things said its still a great buy and with that little flaw I am still happy.

5901788,2,B00EC9UHWG,"I was very disappointed that all the music on all 10 seasons was taken out and replaced with music I don't recognize.  Due to copyright issues I guess.  If you want to hear Losing My Religion when Brenda breaks up with Dylan, then you are out of luck.  If you want to hear Brian McKnight ""Anytime"" when Donna and Noah have their first time together, then you are out of luck.  Very disappointing to say the least.  They even cut out scenes.

5901793,5,B00EC9UHWG,"People really should read what they are buying before purchasing. The description doesn't say anything about it being a ""box set"". These are just the individual series bundle into one for a great price. As far as the music goes they need special license from the record company before putting them on the DVD set, so that's why some songs are left out. This is a great buy. Only negative thing is the prongs that hold the DVDs in their case is cheap and breaks easily.  I love this purchase and it's such an amazing deal.",1388534400,,521,4.427083333333333
5901794,5,B00EC9UHWG,"Please note that amazon has reviews bundled together for BOTH the old ""Complete Series"" collection (which was nothing more than all 10 individually released seasons shrinkwrapped together) and the new, amazing ""Yearbook"" edition, which is the definitive BH 90210 Box set that fans have been waiting for.

I took the plunge and bought this without finding very many pictures online of the inside contents. It's very expensive so I had to sell off all my season sets which I faithfully purchased as they were released through the years. My Yearbook edition JUST came today, so I will not be reviewing the video content, which I have not watched yet. I am assuming that it is the same content from the other releases but I can't confirm that yet.

As for the packaging, this box is HUGE and HEAVY! There are 72 discs packed into 2 custom-designed yearbooks. It looks like a lot of care went into the design. Show trivia and pictures of the cast are throughout the books. They also included pictures of supporting characters like Emily Valentine, Brandon's girlfriend Nikki, Donna's boyfriend Joe, etc. Little blurbs like ""Friends forever"" , ""current couple alert!"", ""Prom!"", ""The wedding that almost was"", etc are sprinkled throughout among the photos. It looks like things a young girl would write inside her own yearbook (The whole package is VERY girly, but I'm a guy. Hey, what can I say? I LOVED this show!) Both the outer box and the books are very sturdy. The ""pages"" inside the yearbooks are thick, glossy cardstock and not flimsy paper pages. This had to be the case because the pages in the books hold the discs in slots. I suppose sliding the discs in and out of the slots may cause some scuffs over time, but I would suggest handling them as delicately as possible.

The actual discs are not the same ones from the previous releases as they have new graphics which are uniform throughout the set. All the discs are white, but they have color-accents which are unique for each season (For example Season 1 is blue, Season 2 is green, etc.) Again, I have not watched any of the discs yet so I can't comment on the video quality, or if these are the edited versions of the show with the alternate music. This set, however, does come with a BONUS disc (which is the 72nd disc) that contains a few extras like the 1 Year Reunion show from 2003, a new ""look back"" segment, and a ""Behind the scenes"" featurette from the early 90's. Oh, I also forgot to mention that it looks like the ""Extras"" from the previous discs also carried over onto these discs as those extras were listed in the book alongside the episode summaries.

Overall, I'm very impressed with this box and I'm glad I have it. It's a great keepsake for any fan of the show. Try to get it when it goes on sale. Amazon have had it as low as $148.",1386288000,38,2811,4.56039603960396
5901795,1,B00EC9UHWG,"I started purchasing these all individually off from ebay, and they are these exact same ones being sold here.  I noticed that on the DVD's that I purchased, not only was music changed, but there are scenes missing as well.  I would watch an episode and remember that there was something more to a scene.  Then by chance I was watching Soap Network and they were playing the same episode I had just watched.  And I was right.  The scene was missing.  I'm sorry, but to have to pay this much for this set and not have the original music or all the scenes is just despicable.",1384646400,46,573,4.308411214953271

5901797,3,B00EC9UHWG,Beverly Hills 90210 was my favorite show back when it aired on television. Sadly I didn't get to watch every single episode. When I saw that the show's DVDs were available for sale and as a complete series I really wanted to buy it. But after reading the reviews I am not sure if that is a good idea. It doesn't really matter to me that these are individual seasons in their own cases just bundled together instead of being presented as a complete series in one case. What bugs me is that the important music from the episodes has been replaced or taken out all together. I know that this has to do with the fact that they would need to get permission to use these songs and that they either didn't get permission or just didn't bother with it. Whatever the reason I am very disappointed. I was really looking forward to getting this complete series set but now I am not so sure if I should because of this. After all the music is just as important as the storyline and the acting. And something tells me that if I get each season separate instead of buying this complete series collection that all the great songs will be gone as well.

5901800,1,B00EC9UHWG,"This is a great show, but if you're a fan, PLEASE don't buy this substandard crap. Take a look at the packaging. The book style of the cases is fine. But the discs, standard dvds, slide into slots in cardboard pages. This is just begging for scratches. Even if you get a bonus disc in the set, don't fall for it. Just pick up the individual season sets. You'll be much happier and it's cheaper in the long run.

5901801,4,B00EC9UHWG,"Granted, the DVD release of the series is a bit disappointing with the music rights stuff, but the series takes on a life of it's own apart from the period of time it represented.  However, it was the '90's, that wasn't easy to hide away from that.  I found the series had an interesting history through the different story lines and the series progression through the years, more so than most other TV shows out there.  On a more technical/quantum view of it all, here's my breakdown on the series in a whole (SPOILER ALERT)-

ACT 1 (Seasons 1-3) The High School Years

Season 1- Series introduction, AKA ""Introducing the Walshes"".  The whole first season focuses on the Walshe's move to Beverly Hills from Minneapolis Mn. Minor interaction concerning the other cast members, which the main focus is with the Walshes.  The Brenda/Dylan romance starts.  Brandon and Brenda, along with their friends, sans David Silver, are supposedly in their Junior year of High School.

Season 2- This season, they decided to turn the fire up a bit and give the other cast members more important roles.  Killing off David Silver's friend Scott and introducing Emily Valentine was the main highlights if the season.  The core group were still in their Junior year of High School.  The Brenda/Dylan romance heats up, burns out and heats up again and Brenda gets sent to Paris for the Summer causing the Kelly Dylan romance.

Season 3- The final season of ACT 1 and the High School Years, or AKA ""Lets have the main characters do stupid things"".  The Brenda/Dylan romance ends in fireworks after Kelly and Dylan announce their relationship.  Steve breaks into the school and is caught, well he gives himself up.  Dylan's dad is blown up in a car by an old client. Donna almost gets her graduation privileges revoked causing the core group + hundreds of West Beverly students to protest.  The core group graduates including David Silver.

ACT 2 (Seasons 4-7) The College Years (the best seasons of the series)

Season 4- First year of college at California University.  Brenda's character seems to have run her course, having more of a minor role impact. First, she decides to go back to Minnesota for college, that backfires because nobody there liked her, so she comes back to BU to CU.  Second, she engages a short term romance and intended marriage to Stuart Carson which fizzled like Alka Seltzer.  Lastly, she got involved with school plays and landed big roles and was accepted in the Royal Arts school in London. She left never to return. Andrea got pregnant and married to lawyer Jesse Vasquez.  Clair Arnold is vaguely introduced to the series.

Season 5- Second year of college.  Valerie Malone, an old Walsh family friend from Buffalo NY is introduced replacing Brenda. Dylan gets ripped off by his father's old one night stands named Suzanne with a daughter which is his sister Erica.  Clair Arnold becomes a member of the core group.  Kelly is burned in a Rave fire caused by faulty wiring in an older house that was illegally obtained.  The Peach Pit After Dark is started.  Andrea, Jesse and baby Hannah leave BH moving to New Haven CT.  Kelly turns down Brandon's marriage proposal and Dylan's trip around the world plan.  Dylan gets involved in a weird film deal with one of his dad's old clients and seeks revenge against his dad's murderer.

Season 6- Third year of college.  Colin Robbins, an unlikeable loser nitwit that Kelly met in New York and Valerie's old flame, is introduced for unfortunately the whole season.  Colin turns Kelly into a coke head.  Another unlikeable character, Susan Keats, is introduced and leaves at the end of the season, good riddance.  The highlights of the season were Dyan leaving, however unfortunate, due to to his wife Toni's death by her father that Dylan was after for revenge and Colin's brainfart actions toward the end of the season causing him to go to jail for a long time.  The final episode of the season was especially good with Steve's 21st party on the Queen Mary which was fun to watch.

Season 7- Final year of college.  Steve and Clair's relationship is clearly falling apart. Brandon picks another lousy girlfriend, Tracy Gaylian.  Clair leaves. The graduation ends with a bang.  The series should've ended here with highlights of seasons 8-10, like the first few minutes of the first episode of season 8, but trudged on three more seasons.  The last of the good years.

ACT 3 (Seasons 8-10) (The series is clearly on life support)

Season 8- Dismal at best, like a bad soap opera.  Brandon went on a Hawaiian vacation with Steve, Valerie, David, and Donna and met dullard Noah Hunter.  Kelly survives a drive by shooting.  Steve starts the newspaper rag ""The Beverly Beat"" with Brandon and David.  Again, Brandon wants to marry Kelly and ends up not happening.

Season 9-  More dismal, except Dylan comes back which adds a little life back to the series. Brandon left before that, probably due to boredom, but due to the Kelly thing.  Gina Kincaid, feh, is introduced.  Kelly shoots dead her rapist at the end of the season.

Season 10- The final nail in the coffin.  The season is primarily a wrap up for the series. Donna's dad dies and Gina leaves...good (probably because she indirectly killed Dr. Martin).  Season highlight is when Dylan finds out his dad isn't really dead, but is in a witness protection program for the past 7 years.  Donna and David get married.  End of story.

The new 90210(2008) apparently picks up where the old series left off, but 8 years later.  Dont waste your time with this, the new producers and writers ruined the old BH 90210 branding and had no feel for the original series.  It was cancelled after 5 seasons.  Good riddance.",1370563200,3,5719,4.756866734486267
5901802,3,B00EC9UHWG,each set was individually wrapped and sealed all together to prevent any damage. shipping was very fast and price for complete set was amazing considering several retailors pricing was at least 50-70 dollars more. the only disappointments that i had were that it was a pain in the behind to have to turn off subtitles at the beginning of each disc and that all warnings and messaging were in portuguise after season 2. i found that i had to open and close my blueray player several times to get a few of the discs to play properly as they would get stuck on warnings and not go to main menu for seasons 4 and 5 but eventually did play properly( my dvd player is new so it wasn't my equiptment at fault) picture quality u can definately tell was from the 90s but over all i was pleased to recieve this as a gift from my husband for christmas. i grew up watching this show and am happy to be able to relive my teenage soaps! its very convenient that this was a complete set because finding these seasons in stores is mission impossible and range from 25-50 per season(best buy) i would recomend this purchase because the benefits outway the minor flaws,1358208000,2,1150,4.403755868544601
