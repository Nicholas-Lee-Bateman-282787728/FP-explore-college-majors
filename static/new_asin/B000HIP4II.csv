8139785,5,B000HIP4II,"This is a great way to obtain the Anchor Bay DVD's ""Race With The Devil"",""Dirty Mary,Crazy Larry"" and the 1997 remake of ""Vanishing Point"" in one awesome package!!! And it's inexpensive to boot!!! Much cheaper than buying these 3 dvd's individually,a great deal for the money!!! Great cult classics!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+",1174089600,,321,5.0754716981132075
