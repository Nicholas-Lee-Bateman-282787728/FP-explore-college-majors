2660408,4,B000IOM1FU,"Season six of Roseanne is probably the most rewarding season on DVD to date - the actors are finally established in their roles, the situations and scenarios are more polished and fleshed-out and the scripts are tighter than before (not to say that seasons 1 thru 5 are bad: quite the opposite, they're great, and I own them all - as should you!!).

This season is notable for a number of reasons: it sees the beginnings of the considerable comedy talent of Sarah Chalke, a more likeable and accessible Becky than Lecy Goranson of previous seasons, the characters of Mark and David (particularly the latter) are given more screen time and better storylines, the nature of the relationship between Bev and her daughters becomes more multidimensional and more rewarding to watch, and the return of Leon makes for some hilarious one-liners.

Actually, hilarity abounds in this season, which contains almost all of my favourite Roseanne moments: Bev's sex accident and her reaction to Dan and Fred's knowlege of it (an undeniable television comedy classic, fans!!), DJ discovering puberty (Darlene's line about this has stayed with me forever!!), Jackie's wedding to Fisher and the preceeding epsiode where everyone thinks she has a crush on Dan, Nana Mary's line to Fred about how he impregnated Jackie... and the list goes on and on.

Similarly, the poignant moments in this season are much stronger and believable than before, with the most notable being in the episode ""Lies My Father Told Me"", where John Goodman's reading of a man coming to terms with his mother's mental illness is absolutely whole and very, very affecting.

This is definitely a wonderful season of an outstanding television comedy, but take my advice: if you haven't got any of them yet, start with Season One. Unlike some of its TV Sitcom-to-DVD peers, the continuity in ""Roseanne"" is strong, and it'd be a shame not to know the background for some of the characters and stories in this excellent collection of episodes.

Highly recommended.",1166572800,20,2014,5.0
2660409,4,B000IOM1FU,"Roseanne and her family are still pleasing audiences in this sitcom's sixth season,1993-94. Roseanne Conner(Roseanne Arnold),her sister Jackie Harris(Laurie Metcalf) and their mother are still succeeding in their eatery,The Lunch Box. Roseanne's husband Dan(John Goodman) still has his Lanford Cycles shop and their kids are still kids.",1162425600,,336,6.170212765957447
2660410,5,B000IOM1FU,"Although this season has some excellent episodes, and overall is a five star season, we begin to see the start of some of the trends that eventually becomes the downfall of the series.

""A Stash From the Past"" is one of the best episodes of the season. The scene with Jackie, Roseanne, and Dan all in the bathroom together is worth the price of admission alone. Also, the Halloween episode from this season is one of the better ones, with Darlene and David pretending to be broken up and seeing other people. Roseanne finally gets bested by a Halloween prank when she walks in on what appears to be Darlene in the aftermath of having brutally murdered David's new beau. ""Homeward Bound"" is also excellent with D.J. having taken up a new hobby - one that has him tying up the bathroom for excessive periods of time. Dan has a man-to-man chat with D.J. to let him know that what he is going through is typical for a boy his age, when D.J. decides to launch a volley of questions at Dan about his new hobby. A very uncomfortable Dan informs D.J. that although this is something that everyone does, it is also not something that people talk about.

""The Driver's Seat"" finally goes into more needed detail about Roseanne's troubled childhood. D.J. steals the family car, and when he is found out, Roseanne reacts by spanking him in front of Dan and Jackie. Her remorse is great, and in probably the best scene between her and D.J. of the entire series, she tells him how sorry she is and how she was hit as a child. In the background, Leon has been adding to Roseanne's stress by trumping her in decision making over at the diner. Leon wound up a partner in the diner earlier in the season in ""The Mommy's Curse"" when Bev sold her shares to Leon to get back at Roseanne for telling her how her opinions really weren't appreciated at the diner.

On a similar theme, we learn more about Dan's childhood. In fact, Dan learns more about Dan's childhood in ""Lies My Father Told Me"". Up to now, we had been led to believe that Dan's father, played by the wonderful Ned Beatty, was a somewhat selfish guy, a bit of a buffoon, and a man who enjoyed his life of traveling salesman to the point that he didn't care too much about the impact it had on his family. In this episode, Dan's mother goes to a mental hospital, and Dan blames this all on his father, gets drunk, and goes over to his father and Crystal's home slinging accusations, but Dan's father is not home. Roseanne retrieves Dan, and when he sobers up she tells him the truth about his mother, how she had mental problems even before she married Dan's father. Dan breaks down crying, having an impossible time of reconciling a lifetime of opinion with the actual truth - that his Dad took Dan's disdain all of these years so Dan would have no bad feelings toward his mother. Dan goes back to his father's house to patch things up, and fixing a toaster together and watching a football game, you get the feeling that Dan may be seeing his dad through different eyes for the first time and maybe this is the beginning of them mending fences. It was a truly great episode.

One of the better long arcs of the season involves Darlene hiding the fact that David is with her in Chicago, rather than in Michigan with his mother. Although it isn't stressed, I think one of the sadder scenes involving David and Darlene is in ""Thanksgiving 93"" where the Conner holiday turns out to be a disaster. David and Darlene are in Darlene's spartan college apartment dining on macaroni and cheese when David asks Darlene if she misses being home for Thanksgiving, and she says ""not really"" in a very deadpan way. This brings reality to the proverb ""Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith"", given the huge fight that is taking place back at the Conner home.

Now for the parts of the season that are not so great. It seems that this is the beginning of a trend in ""Roseanne"" where men tend to be disposable. For one, Jackie becomes pregnant via a one-night stand with one of Dan's coworkers - ""Fred"". Throughout the next two seasons in which Fred appears, the show doesn't bother to give him a background of any kind such as a family or even a last name. He seems to exist simply to give Jackie a child, to make that child legitimate via a brief-as-possible marriage, and then exit Jackie's life forever at the end of season seven because Jackie says so. Also, in seasons three and four, Mark Healey, now Becky's husband, was quite the rebel with distinct ideas about everything, and frequent clashes between himself and Roseanne. When Mark and Becky return home this season, Mark has been neutered for all intents and purposes. When Roseanne discovers all is not well in their marriage, Roseanne's first instinct is to get Becky to eject Mark, although she later retreats from that position. When in previous seasons he was pictured as a pretty able mechanic, this season Mark isn't even able to make passing grades in trade school, and can only get a job when Dan gives him one at the city garage.

There is also the entry of ideas and themes in the Conner household that working-class people simply just don't do on a large scale. For instance, it is ludicrous to think that with two grown children- one of which is in college- and the third and youngest child in adolescence that two people who have had to work so hard just to keep their heads above water all their adult lives would entertain having a fourth child. At this stage of life - their early forties - the Conners would likely cheer the fact that their aging bones do not have to work quite so hard just to put food on the table and want to relax a bit. Their decision for a midlife-child is more typical of the 40-something occupants of the upper west side of Manhattan than small-town Illinois.

In summary, season six is a very good season when grouped with the previous five. When grouped with the last three, season six is just the beginning of the end. In fact, I think that ""Roseanne"" would be better remembered if it had ended with this season and Jackie's wedding to Fred. The problems that begin to creep up in the show in this season would not seem so great if they hadn't had three more seasons to grow to fruition and ultimately into full blown disaster.",1161648000,43,6306,4.473501303214596

2660617,3,B000IOM1FU,"I love the entire series. Currently, I am watching the videos, season by season. I am up to Season 6.

I remember as I watched the series on TV, there was a point when the series lost sight of its mission: telling the story of a working class family struggling to pay bills, but always loving each other. Often times, the love was expressed in sarcastic humor, but the love and support for each other was  always apparent.
At some point there was a change in the humor. It became vicious and destructive. The support and love became hidden. This change is apparent in Season 6. The characters are mean to each other and the laugh track turns cruelty into a spectator sport.
On the positive side, the writing remains good and John Goodman is a very steady, very funny Dan Conner. Ironically, Roseanne Barr Arnold becomes more glamorous looking as the motorcycle business fails, and the Conners have no money to send Becky to college. These are real life tragedies. The peripheral characters are animated by talented actors. These characters are the truth-tellers: Nancy and David.

In general everything intensifies in Roseanne VI:

Roseanne becomes a first class shrew; she delivers her lines as a loud, spoiled teenager
Jackie becomes increasingly neurotic, very withdrawn and almost paranoid.
Dan has become resigned to the fact that he has no power in his marriage or his household
Darlene(my favorite character)is emotionally sadistic to anyone who shows her vulnerability.
DJ has learned opportunism and bullying as a lifestyle
New Becky has left as old Becky and returned 6 inches taller
Mark remains the moronic punk

All of them: A very intense lack of tolerance for each other.",1350777600,,1686,4.901754385964912

2660621,2,B000IOM1FU,"Objectively, this season is one of the worst. The downfall of the entire series can be traced almost directly to this season and more specifically the revelation of Roseanne's troubled past in episode eleven. From that moment on, at least to me, the series lacked the same vigor. When I began to see those cracks appear in Roseanne's ample faade it was apparent to me that she wasn't the matriarch the Conner family needed. The fact that DJ, inarguably the most impotent and saccharine character in the series, was the one to push her over the edge further diminished the respect I had for her. Granted this season was seminal (in more was that one if you're familiar with episode seven ""Homeward Bound"") but a great deal of the story seemed extraneous to me and if I may be so bold, the entire storyline concerning Leon's addition of breakfast to the menu at the diner was a last-ditch attempt to salvage declining story-telling.

A lot of purists will tell you that this season was one of the best as it pushed the proverbial envelope for contemporary sit-coms (most notably episode 4 ""A Stash from the Past""), but I want to go out on a limb and say that more important than anything good it may have done it produced problems for the series and for television in general. I refer back to my earlier point, Roseanne's declining authority in the Conner household. This series hinged in large part on the humor generated from the juxtaposition of an solid yet short-statured woman in the lead role and a buffoon, for lack of a better word, in the traditionally controlling role of patriarch. When it was revealed that Roseanne's entire personality was built on a foundation so easily manipulated I would say it set the cause for a strong female role in sit-coms back some time. Beyond that, DJ lecturing Roseanne on morality in episode 22 ""I Pray the Lord my Stove to Keep"" with some sort of perverted authority from his nascent Christian conversion is absolutely foolish. I point to the lack of a unified female leader in the series Friends, where every female character was simply a caricature of a timely feminine stereotype with little substance underneath. Even today, the ludicrousness of Jane Lynch's Sue Sylvester overshadows any real credibility she could bring to the television matriarch.

A crime was committed in season six of Roseanne. The culprit: a scorned writer with homosexual proclivities or a deeply disturbed loathing for female authority.  The weapon: a sloppy conglomerate of limp teenage issues and contrived personal experiences organized for writer's convenience named DJ Connor.",1297296000,4,2606,4.891402714932127
2660622,2,B000IOM1FU,"Roseanne is still one of my favorite shows. It's still relatable with so many people who lived or are living in small blue collar towns. The comedic twist put on the show in that setting was really a draw for me and I'm sure many others, but season 6 is where I feel the show totally jumped the shark.  Roseanne's charachter became such a control freak and not saying she wasn't a strong willed woman in past seasons, but she got down right mean in some of the episodes having the other cast members scared of her and her demanding, manipulative ways. It was like the whole world had to revolve are her. The family members basically had to answer to her.  Whatever the reason were, whether it was the writers or the demands from Roseanne herself who made these changes, I feel they were not for the best of the show.  Replacing the Becky charachter with Sarah Chalke was a big mistake too.  The new Becky brought in this whiny valley girl aspect to the charachter which really made me cringe at her behaviour in some of the episodes.  I still love Roseanne and this show, but as far as I'm concerned, this was the last season because it didn't get any better after this.",1289174400,3,1170,4.398148148148148

By seasons 2 and 3, they had found their footing, so seasons 2 through 7 are the best. The last season is probably my least favorite.

2660674,5,B000IOM1FU,"After a person first experiences a psychosis triggered by drug use, this episode (A Stash From the Past) does come across as entertainment because we've already made friends with the cast, and it was a great effort by the actors to show us what drugs do to the mind. In its extremes, they are forgetting what was said, after some overemotional impact to really nothing more happening than DJ talking to them, the obvious paranoia related to marijuana that is displayed here could and should persuade people to stop smoking it. I'm currently being treated for a form of schizophrenia after 9 years of smoking marijuana, and this episode really dedicates itself to that warning. But the problem is that people who use drugs don't know these things for themselves. They think this is funny and real, and they'll get away with it, no problem. Whenever I'm drinking too much coffee or whenever I don't have my meds, it can be very scary, and through enduring enough of the paranoia, a person becomes isolated and ultimately wants to kill themselves rather than feeling this.",1186358400,,1069,4.815217391304348
2660675,5,B000IOM1FU,"When it comes to over-weight female comics making eponymous sitcoms in the mid-eighties to nineties, none did it better than Roseanne.  Whether it was under either her Barr or Arnold surname, Roseanne produced intelligent and hilarious comedy with an outstanding cast of supporting actors and some of the most hard-hitting and innovative scripts of the era; scripts that made you laugh without insulting your intelligence.

  I loved Roseanne then, and it's even better now, a little older, a little wiser, and a little more jaded by subsequent failed attempts to repeat the Roseanne phenomenon with lesser female comics of varying sizes.

  This DVD is so funny that I can write this review in full knowledge of its brilliance despite the fact that I haven't quite found the time to watch it yet.  I know that I will soon, just like I did with the previous five seasons.

  John Goodman is also brilliant in this.  So brilliant that sometimes I wished that they had called it ""Dan"" instead of ""Roseanne""; or at least ""RoseDan"" in an effort to acknowledge his stellar efforts.

  Laurie Metcalf steals every show, but despite this I don't feel that they should ever have considered calling it ""Jackie"", because the ""RoseJackie"" compromise doesn't quite have the same aesthetic effect.

  Either way, I would have loved a spin-off along the lines of ""My Two Dads"" where the two different actors who played Becky over the years could meet up, live together, and maybe date Paul Reiser and Greg Evigan?",1179014400,,1499,4.904382470119522
2660676,5,B000IOM1FU,"Like a good wine The Roseanne sitcom continues to get better with season six. Highlights are the first episode where Roseanne packs Darlene off to College in ""Too Down One To Go"" and ""A Stash From The Past"" where Rosanne and Dan begin reminiscing about their days as teenagers after they discover a stash of Marijuna in the house. Sarah Chalke makes her first appearance as Becky in ""Homecoming"" and regular guest artist Shelly Winters makes a hilarious appearance in ""Thanksgiving 93"" Long before Ellen, Roseanne was already causing controversy and provoking open discussions about sexuality with the episode ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" where Roseanne and Jackie visit a gay bar and Roseanne receives a kiss on the lips from Guest star Mariel Hemingway. In one of the most heartfelt episodes ""The Drivers Seat""  Roseanne has to cope with her actions after she hits DJ.

This is a must have for any fan of Roseanne, sadly this series does not feature any extra's but it includes all 25 UNCUT episodes and is one of the funniest seasons with regular cast members returning John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sarah Gilbert and Sandra Bernhard. Roseanne season six, feels as fresh and new as when it first aired on TV and is a great way to reaquaint yourself with a truly beloved show that was one of the most successful Television sitcom's of the 80's and 90's.",1174348800,,1349,4.785407725321888
2660677,3,B000IOM1FU,"Well here it is - the beginning of Roseanne's downfall.  Season five started the change of direction when Lecy Goranson hit the road.  Season six was the big shift in direction for the show that worsened with each following season, before it finally completely hit bottom in its final year.

This 1993-94 season shows some life left in Roseanne.  Jackie's pregnancy, DJ's adolescence, Roseanne and the gay bar, the whole David/Darlene cohabitation arc -- all these were good, as were several other episodes.  But so much was beginning to go wrong.  Roseanne was becoming too egomaniacal, blurring the lines between rich star Roseanne Barr and working class character Roseanne Conner...and her post-surgery look was just odd.  Bev become more prominent and more annoying.  The storylines were gearing into the dramatic a little too often.  And the biggest punch in the gut was the addition of the just plain awful Sarah Chalke as Becky.  Goranson played brainy Becky with a bitchy flare.  Chalke stepped in and suddenly Becky was a gawky bimbo.  (Chalke turned out fine in Scrubs, but was totally miscast and I'm guessing inexperienced at this time.)

I'm giving this season three stars because of its good parts.  Seasons seven and eight both probably rate a 2 and season nine a a great big 1.  Such a shame because the first half of this series was absolutely wonderful.  It was great to see Goranson back for a portion of season eight, but even she had the good sense to abandon ship soon after her return.

Despite raking the final seasons over the coals, I can still claim this show as one of my favorites...based mainly on the first five seasons.  Season six saw the last bit of life and can still be called fairly good.  Too bad there weren't any extras with the set.",1173312000,15,1773,4.754098360655738
2660678,5,B000IOM1FU,"This Season of Roseanne is a little different from all the others.  It's one of the funniest for sure, but nothing really major happens in the lives of the Conner's like in the subsequent seasons.  Jackie having a baby is the only MAJOR event.  Even with the comedy aside, I rate this a 5 because Roseanne, the show as well as the person, sort of pioneer dealing with a multitude of real life situations on television.  The show takes on very serious issues but blends it with comedy, which makes it one of a kind for its time.",1169856000,,527,4.346938775510204
2660679,5,B000IOM1FU,"Not only did season six prove that sitcoms can last beyond four or five years and deal with serious issues, but it still has a phenomenal amount of comedy! This season is definitely one of my favorites, and no matter how many times I watch them these episodes still leave me with aching sides.

Some of the more serious episodes, such as the two part ""Past Imperfect"" and ""Lies My Father Told Me"" as well as ""Don't Make Room for Daddy,"" ""Two Down, One to Go,""  and ""The Driver's Seat,"" deal with issues such as mental health, parental rights, empty-nest syndrome, and  - as many others have mentioned - the fine line between discipline and child abuse. All of these are glowing examples of the craftsmanship behind this raw, honest, and always entertaining show.

Many others have talked about the serious issues in this season, but many have failed to acknowledge the brilliance of the comedy. My favorite episode by far is on this season - ""Stash From the Past"" - which is a masterpiece of comedic genius. It may have shown adults using drugs, but it also is a microcosm of using drugs then realizing what a complete fool you were. ""Guilt By Imagination"" was one of those episodes that was so funny because it was absolutely true. And ""White Trash Christmas"" is a Yuletide classic in my house (for there is always extra drama at the holidays, I don't care who you are). And who can forget the look on Bev's face in ""Body By Jake"" when Fred shouts why she broke her hip? (If you don't know why, buy this season and find out! It's that great! Even my husband loves it!)

The lack of an ""Extra"" about Sarah Chalke joining the cast as Becky was quite disappointing (but perhaps she was booked and couldn't make time for it, we'll keep our eyes peeled on Season 7).

All in all, 5 stars. The quality of the shows more than makes up for the lack of extras.",1169078400,2,1852,4.448377581120944

2660681,4,B000IOM1FU,"This season doesn't seem to be the best-loved one for the DVD company.

There are no extras! Is this what the rest of the box sets will be like? If this season was so controversial and noteworthy, why didn't they bother to include a couple of interviews? The new Becky could have been dealt with in a featurette, for example. After this season, the show started to change tremendously every season. It would have been interesting to hear some of Roseanne's commentaries.

I also hate the cover design, it's the same for every box set, they just replace the pictures and the color. It's cheaply made!

The show itself is great, of course, and that's why it still gets four stars from me.",1167868800,4,686,4.560975609756097
2660682,5,B000IOM1FU,"Usually after 5 seasons a show can lose it's luster, but Roseanne's sixth season was truly one of the best, and the Domestic Goddess Roseanne was at her most beautiful!!!! She should have been the poster child for what a person should look like after having multiple plastic surgeries, because she just looked so damn fabulous!!!

I really enjoyed the new direction of the show, starting with more focuss on the adults instead of the kids all the time. This season definately challenged Roseanne to tackle some tough issues like child abuse( I think this subject will always be a heated debate due to the fine line of physical discipline and abuse)Roseanne seemed way too hard on herself, because she never hit DJ before and like Dan said he had it coming, considering what he had done.

John Goodman also had a chance to shine this season when coming to grips with the truth behind his mother's mental illness. This episode was definately reminiscent of the way Norman Lear would do an episode of All in the Family when the scene would be so intense with emotion with no sound from a live audience and it forces you to really feel in the moment.

This was definately a good mix of comedy and drama during season 6, where Roseanne, Dan, and Jackie was at their prime!!! My favorite episode would have to be when Jackie has her baby, because usually those kind of episodes are so stale with the panicked father to be in a bunch of chaos.
Fortunately this episode was well written and brilliantly funny!!!!

Eventhough most people think Roseanne's remaining seasons went downhill, I will still buy them because they are alot better than the trash that's on tv now!!!",1167782400,4,1664,4.6689419795221845
