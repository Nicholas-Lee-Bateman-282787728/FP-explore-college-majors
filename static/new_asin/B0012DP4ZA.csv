8245140,5,B0012DP4ZA,I loved this video when I say it on TV. I loved it so much I want to buy it to add to my collection.  I am very disappointed that you have changed the buying process!!!  I just want to buy it and watch it at home....I don't want to join any membership ...just buy it the OLD way...that worked well for me but this doesn't.....guess I'll have to go somewhere else to buy my DVD's.....so sorry you've changed!!!,1409270400,,409,4.1645569620253164
