8515084,5,B007E2VVNW,"I have Mirabai's original Fabulous Forever Stretch and love it!  This is similar, but takes it just a *little* bit further by adding a band for deeper stretches.  For those who want to stretch but don't want to do yoga -- either because it's too strenuous or they don't want to twist their bodies into some of those positions -- this DVD is PERFECT!  Mirabai is encouraging and very unintimidating -- and the fabulous water views can't be beat!  Get this DVD, you won't be sorry!",1389225600,7,479,4.534883720930233
