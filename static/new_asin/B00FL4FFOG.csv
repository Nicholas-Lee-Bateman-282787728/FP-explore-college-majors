8616624,3,B00FL4FFOG,"I picked this up for the director's cut of Dark City, which is an easy 5 star (settle for nothing less than the director's cut. The theatrical version compromised the whole intro.) Cloverfield is waste of celluloid, a found film piece of crud, replete with cliches, bad special effects, unbelievable coincidences and actors seeming very hungry for direction which just isn't there.",1451260800,3,381,5.161290322580645
