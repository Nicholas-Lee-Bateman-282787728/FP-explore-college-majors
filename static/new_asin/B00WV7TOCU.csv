7154822,4,B00WV7TOCU,"The final season to be released SHOULD be uncut. If anyone notices any
edits for music issues please POST. I disagree that MWC only got better
with age. It did not. I thought the departure of STEVE RHOADES sent the
series into a balance issue between trying to be a show with a social
message and  topics ALL men could relate to into nothing
more than a glorified COMIC BOOK. There were many
'Changing of the Guard' moments over the years on MWC such
as the creators (MOYE and LEAVITT) departing, followed
soon after by Chief Writer/producer Ellen Fogle.
Most of the original writers were long gone by Season 7.
Al changed from a sort of ""goofy"" obsessed  middle aged
man who did outrageous things in a very comical
can't help but love him way. Who can forget AL building
his own bathroom, sitting on his own FERGUSON, and
battling that mean old lady in the Library (You're
A Bad Seed Bundy""). Such great memories. By the time
all the original writers and producers moved on to
other things, AL BUNDY had changed into a sort of BULLY
of a guy, who used (comic) Violence to make his point.
The original AL BUNDY wasn't a violent man, he was
a bespoke, miserable, yet lovable guy. Later Al Bundy
personna is much angrier and dumber (if that's even possible).

Still the final season is worth having.
There are a few good episodes.  I admit it.
I don't HATE any season.
But I still say the first  5 seasons
MADE the show legendery, the final 5
just ran on FUMES of the original concept.
When BUCK was replaced by A DIFFERENT dog
(Lucky) I knew the show I was watching
and loved..WAS GONE. RIP BUCK BUNDY (lol)",1250726400,4,1606,4.430508474576271
7154823,4,B00WV7TOCU,"Just before this eleventh and final season of Fox's MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN ended,the series just celebrated its tenth premiere anniversary as well as the Fox network's launching. By then,not only was this Fox's very first series,but the longest-running(later surpassed by still-going THE SIMPSONS). Here,Ed O'Neill,Katey Sagal,Christina Applegate,David Faustino,Amanda Bearse and latecomer Ted McGinley please their fans for one last season. Joining MWC enroute to television heaven is another long-running Emmy-winner,ABC's ROSEANNE(ironically,Roseanne Barr was originally chosen to play Sagal's role of Peggy Bundy). Post-MWC,O'Neill continued making theatrical and television films and guest-starred on one episode of Sagal's later sitcom 8 SIMPLE RULES. Applegate retuned to series television in fall 1998 for the short-lived JESSE and last year for SAMANTHA WHO?. Earlier this year,she was diagnosed with breast cancer and is reportedly functioning well. Faustino now owns and operates a nightclub in Los Angeles. Applegate even makes theatrical films today with various supporting and co-starring roles. In 2003,the MWC overall cast,including original cast member David Garrison,reunited for a TV special. That was not the first time the cast discussed their cherished moments and favorite episodes with each other. Long live the Bundys! And Chicago!",1248912000,2,1357,6.109947643979058
7154824,5,B00WV7TOCU,"The single greatest sitcom of all time's final season is finally here.  This is the show that launched the Fox network.  Yes, long before the Simpsons existed, Married with Children started in 1987 and put Fox on the map.  No sitcom since has even come close to this masterpiece.  Even the best today: Family Guy, doesn't even come close to the brilliance of this show.  For a show to outshine such greats as All in the Family, Sanford and Son, and Happy Days is saying something.  And no, the Simpsons doesn't even belong in the same league as Married with Children or Family Guy...period!!!  Al Bundy is far and away the greatest fictional character in TV history.  Not many shows can say they made it through 11 great seasons.  Some shows start off good with their first season or two and just stink afterwards.  Married with Children was magnificent from season 1 to season 11 with out question.  Any DVD collector should definitely have every season of the greatest sitcom ever in their library.  This show will live on forever!!!",1248825600,8,1035,4.688888888888889
7154825,5,B00WV7TOCU,"It's about time that Sony released this 1996-97 Season of the Bundy's out on DVD since I've been waiting for the longest time to have the Bundy's final season on DVD, especially since Sony already has the first 10 seasons of the Bundy's on DVD along with the fact that the Bundy's 11th Season was one of my favorite seasons and the season when I think the sexy, but the daffy airheaded Kelly(Christina Applegate)was looking her best along with the fact that this was the show that made Christina Applegate a star and very popular to this very day and Applegate's mastectomy in 2008 has now made her an inspiration to all women battling breast cancer too, which makes Christina Applegate a good role model and I will always love her for that as well.

The Bundy's Eleventh Season also has some of its best episodes like when Kelly gets an acting gig as a princess on a kids show that eventually ends up faltering when Kelly becomes snotty and too controlling.

Another is the episode when the lowlife perverted Al(Edward O'Neill)gets to be on the show COPS riding along with Chicago P.D. and Kelly gets a commercial gig as the Virgin Olive Oil girl when FAMILY TIES Tina Yothers does a cameo appearance.

Another is the episode where the Bundys take a vacation to Branson, Missouri and Kelly and Peg do a singing gig as The Juggs to help make ends meet with a special cameo appearance by country western singer(Tammy Wynette), whom died 2 years later in real life.

Another is the Series Finale episode when Kelly is about to get married and move out of the Bundys house and then finds out on her wedding day that her fickle ex-con fiancee was being unfaithful to her by making a pass at Marcy(Amanda Bearse)and ends up calling off the wedding leaving us no real explanation on whether Kelly still moved out or stayed living at home or what, but chances are Kelly was still living at home after the disaster on her wedding day.

However I was kind of surprised that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN lasted this long and I'm sure it was time for the Bundy's to move on and say goodbye since this show was getting burned out and the Bundy's were obviously getting tired, especially Christina Applegate(Kelly) and Edward O'Neill(Al).

This season also takes me back to memory lane to when FOX had temporarily moved this show to Saturday nights in September of 1996 showing the Bundy's after COPS & AMERICA'S MOST WANTED, but was eventually moved back to Sundays, due to scheduling conflicts and then the Bundys were moved to Mondays in January of 1997 before this shows cancellation in the Spring of 1997 after FOX had the Bundy's Series Finale episode in May of 1997, but the one thing I cant understand is why didn't sony have the series finale episode on this DVD.

In the meantime, I can hardly wait till they finally release the Bundy's 11th Season on DVD this Fall, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday October 13th, 2009. Yipee!",1247097600,14,2928,4.608445297504798

7154896,4,B00WV7TOCU,"Love the Bundys. That said I have to disagree with some of you all when you say its one of them shows that doesnt have a moral to the story/series.

1. Never Mess with a Bundy.

2. No matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you fight or how much you struggle or strive 90-99% of the time: You...JUST...CANT...WIN! Unless Youre messing with a bundy then chances are greatly increased Like in ""What goes around came around"" one of the girls bud had a crush on in the past humiliated him, then she did it again but this time on stage at the prom and Kelly got revenge for him. Then when kelly is told to 'put out or get out' in a later episode Bud gets revenge for her and gives the guy measles I think it was. And What about the labor day Episode where the people in the next car tell Al to 'shut the hell up'? Free-way Brawl anyone?

3. Also A bundy is a bundy's own worst enemy Like in the ""Bundyful Life Episodes"" They are happy with out me? Hell I wanna live then! Paybacks for them making me miserable my whole life! Seemed to be the Moral of that Story. And how about when Peggy Out-bowled Al? Or when Peggy swapped Kellys Jello for Home-Ec class that Al ate in the middle of the night, just so she could finally get her diploma even though Kelly got held back or had to go to Summer school?

4. And there are alot of Food opportunities all around the house if you but look.....Toaster Leavins anyone? Hows about a Tang-wipe? Or Toothpaste sandwiches...so you can eat AND fight cavities at the same time.

My favorite episodes would have to be (Not in any particular order): Rain Girl, We'll follow the sun, Married with Aliens, Wabbit Season, You better shop around, Route 666, The England episodes, Poppy's By the tree, You better watch out (Santa dies), Peggy and the Pirates (Cabin Boy-Girl lol!), Take my wife Please, How green was my apple, The Camping Episode (in season 3), Married with...Queen (Season 3), Hot off the grill, Who'll stop the rain?

  ...And My Ultimate Favorite I think is the Episode where the Bundys have to play football in Hell to get out of Hell with Satan (Robert Englund ?spelling?) as the referee (I cant remember the name on that one but it was Hilarious!).

Over all I loved the Bundys although the ""Seven"" episodes were kinda confusing/annoying? I remember how he, Seven, showed up but I don't rememeber about how/when he left. But it kinda threw off the dynamic in my oppinion, then again it was pretty ironic to see peggy doting on him when she never did for Bud or Kelly (Unless they were moving out of the house, another irony?). Like when the others just simply sneezed once and she threw them out so Seven wouldnt get sick...

Loved the cast everyone was Great made me laugh till i cried. And I am sooo glad it was released on DVD although I was kind of disappointed when I think in Season 3 They changed the intro music. The Original was just classic Bundy. The new music does kind of fit cause it brings to mind a 3-ring circus But still I Liked the original much better.

Anyway this is just my oppinion.

7154900,5,B00WV7TOCU,"Man, I still can't believe that Married...with Children ran for eleven seasons! But hey, I can still believe that it's an excellent show. This is, without a doubt, the greatest live-action sitcom in the late 80's and 90's. The Cosby Show and Full House have failed to bring a large amount of humor in all of their episodes, but almost every single episode of Married...with Children really made me laugh. Yeah, the jokers are crude and politically incorrect, but I love it. This is a very raunchy show, and it never takes itself very seriously. But while this eleventh (and final) season is still hilarious, it seems like some of the jokes have been recycled from earlier episodes. They aren't as effective as they were a few seasons back. But still, it's a good season, and it's a very fitting farewell to the classic sitcom. And let's not forget: Al Bundy is STILL the king!",1267833600,,876,4.658064516129032

This show made me laugh from the first minute to the last, and finally I have all 11 seasons, even though in my opinion some seasons where less funny than others, my favorite is the 3rd season, this was a show that broke ground in the mid-late 80's. My only complain is that I would like to have closure, the last episode being funny as hell, it just did not have the flavor of a farewell show, being that not even the cast knew what awaited for them, NO 12TH SEASON!!!!

If you grew up watching this show and liked it, I highly recommend you get all eleven seasons, I am sure they will put out a whole seasons package. For me it was worth the money and the wait.",1264982400,,1070,4.270935960591133

7154904,5,B00WV7TOCU,I absolutely love this show. It's my favorite sitcom--ever!! It's one of the few shows that makes me laugh so I never get tired of it. I actually watch an episode or two everyday. Sometimes on cold snowy days I will sit and crochet while watching them straight through starting with season one. Can't say enough good things about the Bundy's.,1263340800,,342,4.622950819672131
7154905,5,B00WV7TOCU,"The Bundys are a spectacularly anti-PC, dysfunctional wreck of a family. That's what makes Married With Children so hysterically funny. Poor, beleaguered shoe salesman Al Bundy, has much to contend with in life. There's his terminally tacky, oversexed wife Peg. Not to mention Al's slutty daughter Kelly, and smart-Aleck son, Bud. And the world around Al has changed, much to his dismay. Al is still stuck in a Neanderthal male mentality, especially with regards to women's rights. He's like a modern-day Archie Bunker, who is unable, or unwilling to adjust to contemporary society as it is.

Ed O'Neil played Al with a smug, male-chauvinist-pig relish. Katy Segal as Peg, lit-up the screen with her own bawdy charisma. Together, they had a crackling comedic chemistry between them. The supporting cast, certainly augmented the loose-cannon hilarity of this show. But Ed O'Neil and Katy Segal, were the center that held this show together, during it's long run on TV. The show would've been much less entertaining, without the two of them. Married With Children can now be enjoyed via DVD. Check it out, and see why this mad-cap sitcom was so phenomenally popular, when it was still on network TV",1261958400,,1196,5.040404040404041

7154907,5,B00WV7TOCU,"This, imo, is the best sit-com ever produced. It affected and changed the genre.
The 11th season, though, is for those who must complete their collection.",1261353600,,154,4.961538461538462
7154908,5,B00WV7TOCU,"This season has a lot of good episodes. My favorite of this season was the 3-part ""Breaking up is easy to do"" which shows Al and Peg separating. It answered the question I have had for a while, which is, why doesn't Al just get a divorce? The answer is that deep, deep down, he really loves Peg. But you won't hear him say it. We see he really is attracted to Peg when she seduces him as a stripper, although he doesn't know it's her until the end of the episode. There is also an interesting peek at what might have been if he and Marcy had gotten along, when her ""identical cousin"" shows up, and she and Al strike up a friendship.
Now, don't misunderstand this, because I feel that Married With Children is hands-down the best sitcom ever, but.. this final season has some episodes that just aren't that good. Some episodes that were particularly below average were when Al, Griff and Jefferson join the National Guard, and when Bud's prison-pal girlfriend holds the family hostage. I could tell that it seemed like they were running out of good ideas, so maybe it's for the best that MWC ended when it did.
In the end, there will never be another show like this one. You know this is a classic show when the networks are still comparing their new shows to this one. Any fan of sitcoms should have all 11 seasons on dvd. My personal method for maximum enjoyment of this show sounds strange, but it works. Don't watch it every day. Watch it only once or twice a year, if even that much. The reason for that is the shows stay fresh if you don't have them memorized. So, farewell to the best tv comedy ever. I'll never forget Al Bundy and Married With Children as long as I live.",1261180800,,1678,4.33015873015873
7154909,4,B00WV7TOCU,"OK,, FINALLY we get the last season. But I don't know.. I LOVE this series, I HAVE every single DVD, but you can really tell the drop off on quality on the last DVD, it to me looked like they mailed it in.
I gave it 4 stars for ""Death of a Chevyweight"" and The Break-up episodes.
(Matter of fact if the Series ended with the ""breaking up is hard to do"" story set I would of been like "" OK .. at least it ended on a fun light note)
It is just I dunno.. sorta like the first season.. it was ""OK"" not great or too funny.

It just seemed that when they throw in new people they just drag it down (the bandit 2-parter for example)

Anyway that's my 2 cents, I would say get the DVD to complete the series if you are like me and love the series, but it will be like my season 1 DVD.. not viewed too often!

IMHO seasons 4-6 are my favorites and yes even 7 (once they booted Seven!)

7154911,3,B00WV7TOCU,"After eleven seasons of madcap misadventures and outrageous family values, America's most dysfunctional family says good-bye in ""Married... with Children"" The Complete Eleventh Season. In this final season, Al (Ed O'Neill) is held hostage by a group of angry fat women who accuses him of being prejudice against the obese. Peg (Katey Segal) suffers amnesia and becomes Al's ideal housewife. Kelly (Christina Applegate) tries to abstain from having sex in order to play a nun for a TV commercial. Bud (David Faustino) lowers his standards on picking up women and starts dating Al's boss Gary. Marcy (Amanda Bearse) becomes jealous when Jefferson (Ted McGinley) gets too much attention in the health club. ""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The eleventh season suffered a significant drop in viewers due to constant timeslot changes. Adding the rising production costs, the comedy series was cancelled without a big finale episode. Despite a few standout episodes (Twisted, Kelly's Gotta Habit, Crimes against Obesity & Damn Bundys), the final season is certainly not one of the show's best.

""Married... with Children"" The Complete Eleventh Season is a considerable letdown to one of the funniest comedy sitcoms from the Fox Network. All 24 episodes of the final season are presented in their original broadcast full screen format. Both picture quality and Dolby Digital stereo sound are acceptable. The interactive menus are simple and there are no extras included. Overall, ""Married... with Children"" The Complete Eleventh Season scores a ""C+"".",1256169600,6,1627,5.3803921568627455
7154912,5,B00WV7TOCU,"Political Correctness? WTF is THAT??? And who cares? This show is great with all it's taboo humor about sex, drugs, stereotypes and just plain ol' silly situations that is pure escapism! Ed O'Neill should be proud that his characterization of Al Bundy has gone down as TV legend...NO ONE but Mr. O'Neill could make Al what he is/was. David Faustino should get kudos as well as his portrayal of Bud; for a character who supposedly doesn't get the babes, he gets more than his share from Al's boss Gary...actress Janet Carroll (Gary) finally gets to show us how hot she is this season!

And then there's the old ""Ginger or Mary Ann"" argument regarding Peggy and Kelly; my circle of buddies usually choose Peggy - Katey Sagal looks slimmer and tighter in this eleventh season that'll make Kelly voters switch.....

Not many TV characters make me laugh out loud...but Ed's Al Bundy does. Would I want to live next door to an Al Bundy? Or have an Al Bundy in my family? Or be like Al Bundy? Heck no! He's devilish, crude, crass, selfish, trashy, insulting and smells bad. So what makes us love and root for this guy? Is it because he says things we wish we could? Or that he's an underdog? You can come to your own conclusions but my explanation is he just makes me damn laugh OUT LOUD. And for me, that's a helluva lot.",1255651200,2,1315,4.475
7154913,5,B00WV7TOCU,"The final year is a step up from the last few years, which descended into total vapid crudity.

Now, the final year also retains crudity that ""Married with Children"" (MWC) is known for, yet plot quality has risen (the jokes aren't as obvious and even when the punchline is, there are enough instances where you don't get the set-up until after the groundwork has been laid), and goes new places/tackles new ideas.  For example:

* ""The Stepford Peg"" - Peggy gets amnesia and Al trains Peggy to serve him 24 hours a day (literally).  Rating:  5-stars
* ""Grime and Punishment"" - Bud lands some money and Al now demands rent.  Unfortunate, Bud being the smart one, knows renters' rights and calls in the authorities.  Hilarity really does ensue.  5-stars
* ""Kelly's Gotta Habit"" - Bud gets Kelly in for a product ad commercial, but has to clean up her wardrobe and act (not being ""easy"") in order to get the role.  Another 5-star ep.
* ""Bud on the Side"" - Bud, eyed by Al's boss, go into a relationship - much to the initial chagrin of Al, until his boss starts furnishing the shoe store with a large TV and beer.  Obviously a total farce, but is remarkably funny (and, of course, crude).  Another 5-star winner.
* ""Crimes against Obesity"" - not a clip show as such; most of the women Al has insulted over the years make a return visit.  Definitely not PC, but this one too had me rolling:  5 stars.
* ""A Babe in Toyland"" - Kelly is hired to host a children's show when the existing host is axed.  The subplot between Al and Peggy still has me rolling too.  Oh, this is a top-notch episode.  5 stars, obviously! :)
* ""D*mn Bundys"" - (episode title is not censored on the DVD case).  Al makes a deal with the Devil so he can play on a NFL football team.  The 3D gimmick FOX ran is so-so but the overall episode still, like the others I've mentioned, show the show has a LOT of life left in it.  Or at least has a second wind... (I will also bypass the obvious pun...)
* ""Lez Be Friends"" - Marcy's identical cousin arrives and comes out to Al.  Great acting by all involved.  Note, this episode originally aired 20 days before ""Ellen"" did a GLBT-themed episode too.  MWC got there first.  (And both shows were great in what they wanted to do.)  Rating: 5 stars.

Now, the funny thing with this final year is, some stories (e.g. ""Grime and Punishment"") take place in 'the present' - meaning the actors act their physical ages.  Other stories, (e.g. ""Crimes and Obesity"") have the kids acting like they were in season 1.  Okay, David Faustino and Christina Applegate are a decade older, and despite being veteran actors, I can't believe they're playing 13- and 15-year olds because they obviously look mid-20s.  No amount of acting will overcome that particular barrier.  The shows are still funny, but that pesky ""looks"" issue cannot be avoided.

FOX, with the final year, kept moving the airdate from its original comfy Sunday line-up to Saturday.  And then to other days.  And not always advertising.  I'm not sure ""The Stepford Peg"" ever got aired; likely due to a football game going overtime...  Usually that's a big sign a network wants to axe a program, by moving the time slot (which was initially advertised with Al mimicking John Travolta and Saturday Night Fever, of course) but then quietly made other changes.  I was hooked with this season early on, which was amazing given how the series turned empty for the last 3 years.  I can't pinpoint the entire WHY, but there is a freshness in the stories, some of which hark back to the series' roots.

Oh, the Kelly marriage episode and the 3-parter where Al and Peg split up are the obligatory clunker episodes.

At least it ended on a high note, albeit with an episode that didn't air ""Chicago Shoe Exchange"" as FOX promoted Kelly's marriage to be the final episode.  A final episode that didn't feel like a finale in any sense...

Definitely a must-have set for fans, even those who gave up on the show after season 5.  This one readily eclipses seasons 5-10 in terms of laughs.",1255478400,11,4033,4.522821576763485
