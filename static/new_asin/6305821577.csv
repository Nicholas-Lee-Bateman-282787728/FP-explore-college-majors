1084890,5,6305821577,"I just finished viewing this DVD from start to finish, and I gotta say... it still keeps you interested. Having jumped onto the Trigun bandwagon all the way from Vol. 1, I kinda find it hard to wait for each succesive vol. release. But as always, what I see does 2 things... (1) Keeps the story moving along at the usual pace, and (2) makes you want to kill someone to see what happens next! My only gripe, as with all the trigun DVDs, is that there just aren't enough extras to speak of. But even that isn't enough to blemish this series' perfect record. As always, this is my own opinion, and you are allowed to disagree if you see fit. After all, you have the right to be wrong.",981590400,,681,4.206106870229007
1084891,5,6305821577,"The Trigun series has unfolded from a funny string of gags and wonderful action into a story of near-epic proportions. Volume 6 of the series, Project Seeds, begins by uncovering some of the mystery surrounding the past of both Vash the Stampede and the mysterious desert planet the series takes place on. Wolfwood (A character making appearances since the third DVD collection) also shows up for most of this collection and reveals a bit of information about his past and motives. For a time, it takes a serious attitude, something hardly present up to this point in the series, but by the last episode, it's returned to classic Vash craziness and fun.
 Overall, Trigun has just the right blend of cinematic and story components to make it inspiring and a joy to watch.  It's definitely a must for any anime fan but at the same time, stays interesting and tame enough for Just about anybody to enjoy it. It is, however, somewhat violent and strong language comes to the surface occasionally so I wouldn't recommend it for small children.
 On a final note, I wouldn't recommend watching any part of the series without first viewing and understanding all the previous Trigun episodes. Each one reveals a bit more and references those that came before it. Start from the beginning with the $$60,000,000,000 Man.",980812800,7,1309,4.860986547085202
1084892,5,6305821577,"Get ready for intrigue, suspense, and a whole lot of laughing, because Vash the Stampede is on the loose once more!!
The story of the ""Humanoid Typhoone"" unfolds as we understand why REM and Project SEEDs play an important impact on Vash's respect for life and humanity. Emotions explode through out the entire story as we meet sides of Vash we ""BARE-LY"" had a chance to meet(and SEE for that matter,LOL!)
This is definelty one of the best DVDS/VHS from the Trigun series!",980294400,3,472,4.698795180722891

7896813,5,6305821577,"Honestly if you've made it this far in the series you're not going stop now. That being said even if you haven't seen the series and you, for some reason, want to start here then you still will love these episodes. I highly recommend this anime to newbies and old schoolers alike",1402963200,,279,4.384615384615385
7896814,5,6305821577,This is a hilarious/ series type of gunslinging anime. If that does not float your boat this is not the anime for you. Straight up if you like a funny main character whom can be so down to earth you wonder if its the same dude. I give this anime two thumbs up.,1205020800,,260,3.9245283018867925
7896815,5,6305821577,"This volume contains two outstanding 'serious' episodes: ""Rev Saverem"" and ""Goodbye for Now.""  Suprisingly, ""Rev Saverem"" does not pick up where the previous episode left off.  Instead, it flashes back to Vash's childhood (130 years before).  Here, we get the first real glimpses of Rev, Vash's surrogate mother, and Knives, his brother (?).  The writing is outstanding here.  A totally serious and dramatic episode.  We see how Rev's kindness and love instilled a gentle spirit and reverence for life in Vash.  We also see how Knives fed off other's mistrust and used it to justify his own evil.  Alternately poignant and unsettling, this episode provides more clues as to the nature of Vash and Knives.  In true ""Trigun"" fashion, however, we learn enough to confirm that Vash and Knives definitely aren't human, but we're given no explanation as to what they are.
""Goodbye for Now"" picks up two years after episode 16.  Vash has abandoned his identity as the Humanoid Typhoon and is lkiving in peace and anonymity.  Of course, since he is Vash the Stampede, the peace can't last.  The appearance of Nicholas V. Wolfwood foreshadows a situation that only Vash can handle.  And so it goes.  Vash is forced to again take up his burden and head out with Wolfwood in search of Knives.  Plotwise, this episode offers few surprises, but, by this time, ""Trigun"" is really hitting its stride.  The writing balances the series' usual mix of comedy and emotion.  The reactions of Vash's adoptive family to his departure are poignant and sad.
If you're reading this review, you've probably seen some of the earlier episodes of ""Trigun.""  If not, and you're an anime fan, what are you waiting for?",1056844800,,1686,4.897526501766785
7896816,4,6305821577,"Well, wellwe get to learn who that mystrious woman from Vash's past is. We also learn a little about his past and about the planet this series takes place on. I hope in the next 2 DVDs we learn about the scars and the implants. Although Vash gets a new set of clothes but I like the old set. I hope he gets them back. I am glad this one was not has bloody and have the bad language that the 5th one had. Anybody know about that cat? What's up with the cat? I hope you will enjoy this DVD.",1044057600,,488,3.8415841584158414
7896817,5,6305821577,"First off, I love the image on the front of this DVD.  I was lucky enough to get a version that came with a chromium card.
The first episode answeres A LOT of questions you may have about Vash and introduces a character who may be very important to the rest of the series. The other two episodes deal with Vash getting back into the swing of things after the ""Fifth Moon Incident"".
Pretty good DVD.  Not one of my favorites.  But very very solid.  The first episode is probably my favorite of the three.  Rem is very cool.",987897600,,522,4.232323232323233
7896818,4,6305821577,"I found the fifth volume of Trigun (Angel Arms) to be a disappointment because of it's cliche-riddled ""filler"" stories and the lack of progress in the overall storyline (aside from the little surprise the title implies). With the sixth volume, Trigun seems to have, more or less, gotten back on track. The writers this time around, thankfully laid off the cheese so you won't find yourself muttering ""that's so corny"" too much throughout the viewing. Although this volume contains more filler stories, they are at the very least better written and provide a lot of insight into Vash's (the main protagonist) past. The other thing I really liked about volume 6 is the menu screen, that in and of itself is a piece of art.
However, there are still some minor gripes I have with this volume. The big one is running time. Three episodes per DVD is annoying since in the later volumes, one of the three episodes is usually pretty dumb. I just wished Pioneer had followed Bandai's lead and put 4-5 episodes per volume, like they did with Cowboy Bebop.",985651200,,1045,4.715846994535519
7896819,3,6305821577,"-- Is what I wanted to scream during a certain scene (those who've seen this already can probably figure it out ^^;). Well, although I simply adore Trigun and Vash, this and the previous volume have been a disappointment compared to the greatness of volumes 3 and 4. x_X Vash acting ""tough"" annoys me...what's with the ""Ore""?!
  The first episode is the best on the volume and is basically one giant flashback, revealing who ""HE"" is. The other two aren't bad, but don't measure up to the usually high standards of this series. If you're collecting this series to the end, by all means, buy it. But do not start the series with this volume, start from the beginning. *_* Oh, and Knives rules. That is all. ^_^",985132800,,708,4.5234375
7896820,5,6305821577,"As I say do not watch this dvd until you watch the previous five.  It was an amazing dvd, the action the comedy,... this series makes it hard for you to know whether you wan't to cry from laughing or cry from the drama.  I recommend all you who aren't sure if you like this series or not to give this one a chance.  If you don't like it still, then stop, stop watching anime, it does not get better than this.",983923200,,409,3.9634146341463414
7896821,4,6305821577,"The Trigun series is very inconsistent for me.  First it starts off with adventures that reveal little by little about Vash's past.  The adventures were fun but then they come to some brief halt, revealing some of Vash's 'demons'  This DVD basically clears up what happened in Angel Arms and is a transition to the end that will come.  I'm hoping that the last 2 DVDs will be better than the past 2.  Trigun did not keep me interested throughout most of it.  Definately buy this if you already bought the past ones because there's no point skipping out on this one.  I am just saying that this DVD might not keep some people's interests as well as the others.  Just be prepared for lots of talking in this volume of Project Seeds.",982886400,,730,4.43609022556391
