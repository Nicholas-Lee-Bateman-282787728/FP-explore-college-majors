711435,5,6303832601,"Even in the opening scenes of this movie, you feel you are watching quality acting on a New York stage.  Having lived in NY for 25+ years, I can honestly say that this is one special movie and does reflect what we have here.  It brings back scenes of home, family, conflict, forgiveness, perseverence, and the indomitable spirit.  It is a quietly great movie.",1050192000,9,359,4.578125
711436,5,6303832601,"When I first watched this movie with my brother, we cried as we watched as if our own mother was in this movie, it brought back to many wonderful memories we had with her, this is a movie i would love to own, such a wondeful performance by Geraldine Page!",1026518400,9,255,4.12
711437,5,6303832601,"How can a person begin to write an unbiased review on the work of Geraldine Page? If anyone knows the answer, PLEASE let me know!!! This woman is truly beyond peers and this performance, for which she FINALLY won the Oscar is beyond words! Forget the rest MISS PAGE IS THE BEST!!!",1023840000,13,280,4.403846153846154
711438,5,6303832601,"Geraldine Paige creates a masterful memory of her home and
all the joys , activities and sadness that made it a house
full of love...In my work as a hospital chaplain I daily see
how important it is for seniors to share their memories with
friends and especially younger family members. Trip to  bountful
gives us a symbolic understanting of the life review which
normally takes place as we age...and these memories are important and life-giving to all of us....That is why she sings the old
songs and hymns because they carry with them the group memory of who she is and what she means to other people...The son does not understand this in the beginning but then he catches on and the relationship between mother and son completely changes..This happens in nursing homes, and in home care when seniors are listened to and their stories are told and reverenced they begin to own their new surroundings and more easily make new friends
as they go on with their long lives...we all will have to face
something like this in our own families , so why not see the
movie and study it, and it will bring you to BOUNTIFUL.",1015200000,33,1114,4.57
711439,5,6303832601,"This movie was extremely well done and absolutely brilliant. The Trip to Bountiful is pre-Driving Miss Daisy and far better. Geraldine Page who portrays an elderly woman is trapped in her son's apartment with his hateful wife. She plans an escape to try and see her hometown Bountiful before she dies. It's sort of like The Wizard of Oz meets Driving Miss Daisy, with the ""getting home"" theme, and the friends she encounters on the journey.  This movie delivers Geraldine Page at her best, she carries the picture at an awesome pace that will exploit all of your emotions. DVD is calling for this picture, buy this and enjoy classic film making at its best!  Look for Rebecca Demorney and John Heard in supporting roles.",1014681600,15,720,4.752
711440,5,6303832601,"This is Geraldine Page at her very very best, portraying an elderly woman living unhappily with her son and daughter-in-law. The two women don't get along, the daughter-in-law resenting her intrusion in their lives and seeing her presence as a big sacrifice to have to make for her marriage. The steadily growing loneliness of Geraldine Page's character and her journey into her memories of what was and what could have been touches many themes and portrays the wishes and dreams of many ordinary people beautifully. She decides to go back to Bountiful, the only place where she ever was really happy. Would the expectations created by her memories (coloured by the passing of time) be met by the reality of present day Bountiful? Or is it the journey, not the destination, that is all important? This you will have to see for yourself and make up your own mind - because this is a ""must-see"" film. It will make you think about your own plans for living as an older person, it will make you think about what is really important in your life, it will make you think!",1010707200,17,1065,4.64021164021164

712689,5,6303832601,"It's a lovely, touching film, and Geraldine Page is sensational in it. There are very few actresses of her stature that are not only so committed to their performances that you totally believe the characters she plays, but are also such fun to watch. She's not just great, she's wildly entertaining. The entire cast are first rate, and Rebecca de Mornay wisely down plays her performance and allows Miss Page to pull out all the stops in the wonderful scenes on the bus. She's great in this too. Few people here have mentioned how funny it is - watching Geraldine Page quietly trying to wind up poor, much maligned Jessie May is hilarious. What's great about this human triangle, however, is that you are given an opportunity to see everyone's side of a very real domestic situation. There are no villains here. So it's a powerhouse performance from the legendary Miss Page, and despite the moving premise of the story itself, at times very funny. But some of the critics that disliked it back then have a point. At times is betrays its stage origins, especially in the final scenes where John Heard is on the Bountiful property speaking to his mother. The dialogue and the direction in this scene are right off a stage, and you don't quite believe his big speech. And in typical MGM release fashion, this is a cropped print. So at times the tops of peoples heads are cut off. For the absurd price that Amazon is asking for this film, I'd expect an immaculate transfer. I bought my copy for ten dollars.",1425427200,,1503,4.611940298507463

As talented as each actor is, no one gave a slam-dunk performance.  Both Blair and Vanessa seemed totally detached to me.  They seemed to be hurling lines back and forth, but with no real connection.  Kekes persona seemed too hip (and hurried) for the time period.  And Cicely, wellI kept seeing shades of Miss Jane Pittman.  Her mannerism, movements, sounds, etc., was simply a repeat of the Pittman character.  And not because shes older.  For I have watched Fried Green Tomatoes and The Help many times over and never had a Miss Jane Pittman recall moment once.  As her execution of these two elderly characters simply did not crossover to Miss Jane Pittman.  So, I must sayI am partial to the original version of The Trip to Bountiful with the late-great Geraldine Pageas well as the entire cast.

713043,5,6303832601,"Carrie Watts (Cicely Tyson) yearns for her own personal land of bounty, the place of her birth and the home of her family and friends (her ""people"") while currently living in the bustling city of Houston, TX, during the 1940s with her son and his wife.  With Carrie now being in her elder years, she thinks of the happiest times in her life while living there and longs to see it again. She keeps active with housework, continuously checking the mailbox, writing cards to her lifelong friend and trying to stay out of her daughter-in-law's way.  Her thoughts become flooded with memories so near and dear to her heart that she just breaks out into song.  Although Carrie's hometown of ""Bountiful"" doesn't even show up on a map or is known to the ticket agent at the bus station, Carrie feels its pull deep down in her sentimental soul.

Directed by Michael Wilson, from the play by Horton Foote who also wrote the screenplay for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", this movie is a one-way vehicle for Cicely Tyson to shine, and she does wonderfully as the tenacious and effervescent Ms. Watts.  She never gives in or never gives up believing she will return to her beloved home; her real home before she dies.  She doesn't fit in dwelling in the city with her son, Ludie (Blair Underwood), and his insufferable wife, Jessie Mae (Vanessa Williams). While she is always on the prowl for Mama's pension check, Ms. Watts is singing Hymns that only serve to get on the nerves of an overly agitated daughter-in-law.  Sure, she wants to pay her fair share, but Jessie Mae arguably wants every dime.  Selfish is alive and well in this woman's home while Carrie is trying to save some of her money to get to ""Bountiful"".  It is constantly putting her son dead-set in the middle of an overbearing Jessie Mae and a mother with the heart of an angel with a secret purpose.  Carrie loves to share the thoughts of a youth spent in ""Bountiful"" with her son when he cannot sleep; anytime is the right time to talk about this place for Carrie.

Ms. Watts has not gazed at her beloved town in twenty years, to her heart's own pining.  She reminisces of how one could just drop seeds onto the soil and whole crops would spring up in their joy, with the tops of them reaching the sky. Her whole face literally lights up when she speaks of the town.  The questions remain for Carrie; why hasn't she been able to go back and see the beauty of the town she never ceases to ponder about?  Who would keep someone dear from their fondest memory when it could be so easy to accomplish?  Well, just maybe Carrie Watts will take matters into her own hands and attempt to find her old town.  After all, she has had a neverending wanderlust, is aging, and has all of the desire of her youth to back her.

This movie also by Horton Foote and starring Geraldine Page in the lead role was one of my Grandmother's forever favorite stories.  She owned it and watched it repeatedly before her passing away at the age of 98 years.  I am positive with her love of Cicely Tyson that this film would have pleased her greatly also, probably more so. These types of movies with a gentle story and a purpose, easily are great for family viewing.  In this movie, there is the performance of an over-the-top demanding Vanessa Williams who is enjoyable to play the cat and mouse with concerning Ms. Watts and, on occasion, one sees true feelings of caring towards her. I felt a quiet reverence and respect towards his mother from the performance of Blair Underwood.  By the ending, Ludie shows his love towards his mother in a most moving and happy direction.  The movie has been very well cast to make it quite believable and especially emotionally pulling ... like it should be and like it gladly is.",1409961600,19,3744,4.507396449704142

713046,5,6303832601,"American playwright and screenwriter Horton Foote (1916-2009) is best known for his screenplay for Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and his own screenplay for Tender Mercies (1983).  Both won Academy Awards for Foote. I recall with fondness his play, The Trip to Bountiful.  Although I didn't see the original film released in  1953 on NBC, I saw the 1985 movie that won Geraldine Page an Oscar for best actress.

The play, set in the 1940s in Texas, tells the story of an elderly woman, Carrie Watts, who wants to return home to the small town where she grew up, but is frequently stopped from leaving Houston by her bossy daughter-in-law and an overprotective son. The unhappy Watts family lives in a cramped two room apartment. Determined to visit her parents' old home in Bountiful, Texas, Carrie Watts runs away and boards a Greyhound bus to a town near her childhood home for a $3.50 fare.  On the journey, she befriends a young war bride traveling alone and reminisces about her younger years.  The local sheriff, moved by her story, offers to drive her the twelve miles out to what remains of Bountiful. The village is deserted, and the few remaining houses are derelict. Her childhood friend, the last remaining resident, that she had planned to visit has just died.

A Broadway revival of A Trip to Bountiful premiered in April 2013. Legendary Cicely Tyson played Carrie Watts.  It was her first Broadway appearance since 1983. The staging earned a total of four Tony Award nominations  and Cicely Tyson won a Tony for best actress in a play. On March 8, 2014, a made-for-television remake premiered on the Lifetime network.  The film featured Cicely Tyson in the lead role as Carrie Watts, Vanessa Williams as Jessie Mae Watts, Blair Underwood as Ludie Watts and Keke Palmer as Thelma, the young war bride. Tyson and Williams also appeared in the Broadway revival. I watched the DVD of the cable network remake that was released August 5, 2014.

The mostly African-American cast is remarkable.  I read somewhere that this cast was a non-issue because the themes of aging, memory, and the yearning to return to one's roots are blind to race.  The racial casting is an issue: it provides a new and profound shadow to the drama with its 1940s setting in the Jim Crow South and its segregated restrooms and hotels.  Mrs. Watts sleeps on a bench in the bus depot when she arrives in a nearby town in the dead of night. The casting of a white Texas sheriff who offers to drive her the additional twelve miles to Bountiful is also a nice touch.

To prepare for her role, octogenarian Tyson visited Horton Foote's home in rural Wharton, Texas, to get ""a sense of what it is like, to smell it, feel the earth, hear people talk, go to the marketplaces. Being there [in Texas] I understood very clearly why my character longed to return because I was myself mesmerized by the beauty of the place and the tender enfolding of the gulf wind.""

In a way, Cicely Tyson echoes a 1986 interviewer's words about Horton Foote: ""His Texas is not the brawling, big-mouth land of cattle and oil. It's more like the Old Deep South in culture and appearance: a place of moist breezes and lush farmland, devoted spirituality and virulent racism, of aristocracies old, new and fading. It is what he has spent his life writing about.""

A mesmerizing beauty... and the tender enfolding of the gulf wind. A place of moist breezes and lush farmland.  These phrases evoke a deep sense of place, and  it abounds in this production with a gospel hymn, ""This is my story...this is my song...,"" hummed and sung in the background.  Yes, it's the Old Deep South that I grew up in, too.",1409184000,19,3667,4.673405909797823

713143,5,6303832601,"A Trip to Bountiful stars Cicely Tyson in a recreation of her Broadway role of Carrie Watts, who grudgingly lives with her busy, overprotective son, Ludie (Blair Underwood), and pretentious daughter-in-law, Jessie Mae (Vanessa Williams). Unable to drive and forbidden to travel alone, she begs Ludie to take her on a visit to her hometown of Bountiful. When he refuses, Mrs. Watts escapes to the local bus station and embarks on a nostalgic journey back.

Featuring the same cast that appeared on Broadway, A Trip to Bountiful is an outstanding star turn for Ms. Tyson and a touching character study. The cast is first-rate, but Ms. Tyson quite effortlessly shoulders the dramatic weight of the film. She communicates not only in her dialogue, but in her deeply lined, expressive face and frail body. This is a performer who brings to the role of Carrie a lifetimes worth of acting know-how in a showcase role.

Ms. Williams plays the contrasting role of a woman whose values are materialistic and morally shallow. She finds Carrie a burden, an annoyance, and an intrusion into her life with Ludie. Mr. Underwood, aside from looking good, never really inhabits the character of Ludie and looks more like a 1940s fashion model than a stressed man torn between the needs of two strong-willed women. This film is a must see for Ms. Tysons rich, textured performance.

I have seen Cicely Tyson in almost every film she has been in and I have never been as moved by her as much as in this picture.  She is heartwrenching in her desire to get back home one more time.  I haven't been this moved by a movie in a long time and I thought about it for days afterward.

The film revolves around her ""great adventure"" after she successfully plots to run away and climb aboard a bus to Bountiful. But her dreams are broken by the reality that a person cannot go home again. There was nothing to come back to. Her son and daughter-in-law catch up with her to bring her back to her old life. Perhaps for the better by a few lessons learned by all.

It is this movie that made me realize that Geraldine Page was one of our greatest character actresses of all time.

713202,5,6303832601,"The wonderful Page carries yet another film of sweetness, concern, tragedy, renewal...difficult to juggle, but not in the capable hands of Geraldine Page. When F. Murray Abraham annoucned her name he prefaced it by saying ""the best actress in the English language"". Whoopi was visibly disappointed.

What we have here is a leveled, progressive performance, guided by director Peter Masterson, of a woman at wit's end, alone, with memories that she can't shed. The Great Depression took a toll, and she, in her elderly years, took refuge with her son and his materialistic wife in Houston. Carrie Watts just wants to go home, one more time.

She's more adventurous than anyone thinks, and we're up for a fun adventure of redemption and true heartfelt desire.

It's a lovely film, in so many ways. Horton Foote wrote this specifically for Page as a stage show, and expanded it for the screen (receiving  an Oscar nom for screenplay). Page has moments of reflection that are profound and disturbing, and there are volumes of subtext, shown through her bright eyes; never bitter, always hopeful in her faith.

The film is not preachy with religion, so much as it's all she can fall back on. Excellent performances from John Heard, Rebecca de Mornay and Carlin Glynn throw so many different emotions into this film, that I'll be surprised that, at the end, anyone won't cheer and cry at the same time.

After 8 Oscar nominations, Page finally won. She died the following year, at age 64. Not fair.
Not fair at all, to those who crave just a little more of her brilliance.

713640,3,6303832601,"The acting is first rate, but, despite her Oscar, Page was better in Woody Allen's Interiors, in a much more demanding and unsympathetic role. The real stars here are Glynn and Heard, and it's a tossup as to which actor is better, for neither is as accessible as the Page role. Glynn's role is as a seeming bitch, but we never really believe that, as in several moments throughout the film we see she really does care for her mother. Heard's character never has problems showing he cares, but he is a classic hen-pecked type. Since abrasiveness and seeming cowardice are not valued traits, it's no wonder both Foote and the audience sympathize more with Mother Watts, and this is why she is the de facto lead, even if her tale is the least interesting, and most predictable, of the three- especially when we learn that two of Ludie's siblings died in that town, in childhood. The character played by DeMornay is, by contrast, merely a plot device to get inside Mother Watts. With that done, her exit from the film is anticlimactic.
  The film got mixed reviews on its release, but even those who praised it did so for the wrong reasons, lumping it in with lesser nostalgic schlock like The Color Purple and the later Driving Miss Daisy. There was also the critical cribbing regarding Mother Watts' first name, as well as some claims that the film has flashbacks, due to the opening credits scene where we see a young Mother Watts and child Ludie running through a field of flowers. But, since this is the opening shot, and is never repeated, it cannot be a flashback. The film could be considered a flashforward, but given the bulk of time spent in the film's present, this is ludicrous. It does, however, amply show the problems many critics have in dealing with art that does not conform to their preconceptions, nor the promotional material they are given. The film's main themes song, Softly And Tenderly, sung by Cynthia Clawson, is memorable, but scoring is not a strength of this film.

  The Trip To Bountiful has many great points and moments, but it is not a great film, for the translation between media is a difficult thing to pull off. But, the film shows the failure of much contemporary writing, with an over-reliance on diurnal description and rote explanation, whereas true characterization comes from observation- the viewer being to observe what and what not the character does, and how that has an effect on the character, even if the whole observational process is discreetly exhibited. This film is a great example of characterization at its finest, and even though it does not achieve overall greatness in this medium, it small failures point out the way that the truly great works of the filmic medium do achieve it. Thus, it recapitulates much of the learning process that the tercet of main characters undergoes. Not bad for a failure, eh?",1283299200,,2865,4.744979919678715

So many parts of the story are left out or unexplained that it is hard to follow at times.  An older woman lives with her grown son and his wife for many many years.  But they don't say why she has lived with them for so long.  The wife is dominant and mean, but the husband doesn't do anything about it.  The mother tries very hard and does everything for the son's wife, but the wife is still unhappy.  The wife purposely does mean things to the mother just to have the control and upper hand.  The wife lives off of the mothers pension/social security check and waits for it monthly.  When she does not get it she gets very angry.  The mother is treated like a child and just wants to go visit her old childhood town before she dies.  What is the big deal?  Take the woman to see the old town already.  But it is this big production for her to hop on a bus and make it to the old town.  In the end they all agree they should have taken her a long time ago and avoided all of the drama.

713750,5,6303832601,"I tried to find some fault with this movie, but I simply couldn't.  I tried to pick apart Geraldine Page's performance, but I truly can't.

Why, you may ask, would I want to dislike this movie?

Well, for the mere fact that Whoopi Goldberg gave the performance of her career in `The Color Purple' and Page stole her Oscar.  Sure, Goldberg got her Oscar in 1990 (despite Bening being the better supporting actress that year) but I think everyone under the sun knows deep down that that 1985 Best Actress Oscar should have been hers.  So, with that on my mind, I sat down to watch and criticize this small little film; but my end feelings on the film are far different from what I expected.

`The Trip to Bountiful' tells the beautifully uplifting story of Carrie Watts, an elderly woman living with her son and daughter-in-law.  She is miserable, living under the sharp reign of her daughter-in-law Jessie Mae and she desires to see her old home in Bountiful before she dies.  Living in the prison her daughter-in-law has created for her is not the way in which she wishes to die.  Carrie hatches a plan to flee, hiding her social security check from Jessie Mae's greedy paws and making her way to the train station and heading out towards the place she fondly remembers as home.  Along the way she meets up with the tenderly compassionate Thelma and the sympathetic town Sheriff who offers to take her to see her abandoned home.

`The Trip to Bountiful' is as sad as it is inspiring and it will leave you speechless by the films end.  This is the story of a woman who has been reduced to living a life she wouldn't wish on anyone, and the very thought of just seeing a place that brings her fond memories is enough to make her feel like a kid again, happy and care-free.  This woman's emotional journey is brought to life by Geraldine Page's fantastic performance (she is still second fiddle to Whoopi).  She really gathers behind this woman's every solitary emotion and fleshes it out before our very eyes.  She loves her son, and in a way she even loves her daughter-in-law, but she can't live the life they have set for her.  She can't take the fighting and the worrying and the constant feeling of fear in her own home.

Page is supported by a nice cast of supporting actors, most notably John Heard who plays her son Ludie.  He does such a phenomenal job, especially in his final scene, of exposing the hard position he has been forced to reside in; pitted against his wife's demands and his mother's broken memories.  Carlin Glynn, Richard Bradford, Rebecca De Mornay and Kevin Cooney all deliver nice performances that elevate the films core.

At the heart of this film there is a story about a woman journeying home.  Her home is different than she remembers.  The town is all but deserted; her friends are all passed and her home is barren, but that home is everything to her.  Her heart swells with joy at the prospect of just spending an hour within its rotten shell.  She desires nothing more than to have it become a part of her, for it represents everything she feels she has given up; everything she feels has been taken away from her.  `The Trip to Bountiful' is a beautifully sincere, soft and delicate film that will reach your heart and tug those strings and will quite possibly choke out a few tears.",1222819200,12,3320,4.530201342281879

713752,5,6303832601,"Written for TV in 1953, this wonderful play by Horton Foote was revived for film in 1985 with Geraldine Page taking the role originated by Lillian Gish. All resemblance to that first production must have ended even before Page's first line, for she gives the role the stamp of her distinctive style - restless and mercurial, shifting through shades and nuance of emotion several times in a single line of dialogue - and often when it's somebody else's line. Understanding her role as that of a tough and difficult woman, not a sweet old lady, Page put a career's worth of stage and film experience into what turned out to be an Oscar-winning performance.

After more than 20 years, however, what also emerges are the fine performances of the other actors in the film, particularly John Heard as her son and Rebecca Demornay as a traveling companion on the bus. Both bring a stillness to the scenes they share with Page, and when Heard finally lets us see some of the anguish inside his character, it tears your heart out. As Foote devotes his loving attention to the lives of ordinary people whose life crises are universal, we see ourselves in the struggles of a Texas family to deal with age, mortality, and the unfairness of life. The DVD includes interviews with several members of the cast, the director, producer, and others. Of particular interest are their recollections of what it was like to work with Page.",1215993600,5,1417,4.7368421052631575

713755,5,6303832601,"What more can be said about this perfectly acted story?  Geraldine Page's character (Carrie Watts) is cooped up with her son and daughter-in-law in a small apartment.  Her constant hymn-humming drives the in-law nuts, while the latter's selfish, tyrannical demands make Page's life a cramped hell.  The in-law is more interested, it seems, in Watts's Social Security check than in her welfare, and takes every precaution to ensure that Watts never leaves the apartment alone.

Watts is old now, and in her anguish wishes to visit her childhood home in Bountiful one last time.  She schemes to hide her check and light out for the bus station.  She's not gone long before her relatives are in hot pursuit.  She meets several characters along the way, including Rebecca de Mornay's sweet, pretty bus traveler.  You'll be hard pressed to not wipe away a tear when Watts reveals, ever so briefly and without histrionics, the unhappiness of her life and the man she loved.

She finally makes it to the end of the bus line in the middle of the night, not far from Bountiful, but needs to somehow arrange a ride.  Unhappily in the morning the sheriff arrives to take her, and you can feel her claustrophobic frustration and sorrow to be denied her last dream.  The sheriff is a kindly man, though, and he is the one who takes her home, to the abandoned house sitting in the midst of trees and overgrown weeds and grass.  If you've ever visited the ruins of a place you once inhabited, or that of another family, you might be able to guess at the strength and type of emotions that surge through Watts.  Geraldine Page portrays all of this beyond acting, to the point where you think this homecoming is really happening.

In this pretty little spot with the run-down house, the sheriff ruminates as to the people who lived in Bountiful, before cotton and carelessness used up the soil and everyone moved on.  The son and his wife arrive.  There is no soaring climax, no glorious finale, just life going on, which makes this movie so true to life.  Mother and son talk as the breeze rustles through the old house and the plants, and they return to the car.  There is an understated hope of greater understanding and reconciliation between the two women, just like you might think could happen in the real world.

713913,5,6303832601,"Put together a piece that has both a beautiful heartwarming story set in a slower more gracious time than now and the greatest actress to ever act on the American stage or movie screen and you have THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL.  The 1940's was a time when older people didn't have the option to be sent to nursing homes in America so that family members didn't need to be responsible for their elderly's welfare or for assuring that their last days could end with a certain amount of dignity.

Carrie Watts, played perfectly by Geraldine Page had moved in with her lone surviving son and his wife because she had left her girlhood home when the land there was too worn out to provide her with a living after the death of her husband and two of her children.  After twenty years of being away from the tiny Texas town called Bountiful and six years of being cooped up in a two-room apartment in Houston, Texas, Carrie yearned to return to her ""home"" where she could dig in the dirt and make something grow again.  She has made several failed efforts at getting there already before the movie's opening and the strange dance that ensues between her and her son and daughter-in-law is her struggle to make her dream come true while the two of them make every effort to prevent it.

TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL was Page's final performance as she died shortly after receiving the academy award for 1985's best actress.  Hers was an epoch of actresses who were trained to ""overact"" especially in movies.  I once heard Bette Davis say near the end of her life that the trouble with actors and actresses today was that they brought too much realism to their roles.  She and the actresses of her day were told to make their characters ""larger than life"", to maintain a certain distance from the audience.  Too much realism was frowned upon by directors of the day.  Geraldine Page though started out as a stage actress and her performances always rang true at their very core.  She never did or said anything on stage or screen that struck a wrong chord.  I believed her in every role and she was never better than she was in this her last movie.  The Academy got it right that time.",1169596800,8,2158,4.4884910485933505

She was an impeccable film artist, a master actor to awaken us, and make us better. Of all her great films, I think this one the finest. First rate cast - Rebecca DeMornay is moving as hell, and John Heard extra fine as Carrie Watts' son Ludie. Horton Foote crafted a perfect screenplay, intelligent and brave, itself a kind of paean to Page; it holds her sounds, and insights, already in place. Foote deals auspiciously in ribbons of moments actors are blessed to find once in a career. Geraldine Page deserved no less, and she, of course, rose to the occasion. The result is a caution to our complacency, a farewell performance so unaware of itself, and as beautiful as anything you'll ever see on film. Page's repeated traversal of the Baptist hymn 'There is a fountain filled with blood' is one of Bountiful's brilliant grace notes, as her perfect incarnation of Carrie Watts flourishes. Don't miss treasuring this gem. It is American filmmaking at its rarely glimpsed best.",1145577600,13,1130,4.829896907216495
713918,5,6303832601,"This film started out as a television special in 1953.  Then it was adapted for the stage.  And then finally in 1985 it became a film version.

The film deals with the Watt family.  Ludiie (John Heard) is married to Jessie Mae (Carlin Glynn) and they share their one bedroom apartment with his mother Carrie (Geraldine Page).  The Watts are just making ends meet. And Jessie Mae treats Mother Watts as a domestic.

Carrie wants to return to her childhood home in Bountiful, Texas.  While Jessie Mae is out with her friends getting her hair done and shopping, Carrie escapes to the train station and finds that there is no train to Bountiful.  She then goes to the bus station and again, no bus to Bountiful.  She take a bus to Harrisburg.  On the bus she meets Thelma (Rebecca DeMornay).  She is going home to stay with her family while her husband is oversees.  Thelma decides to watch over Carrie while she can and they become friends.

When she arrives in Harrison, she finds that her friend Calley Davis died the day before.  The sheriff arrives and finds out that she is there and notifies Ludiie.  But all Carrie wants to do is see her home.  The sheriff decides to take her out to the farm.  Eventually, Ludiie arrives to take her home.

This is not a movie about words but emotions.  It's the little things that make this film great.  Masterson has gathered a perfect cast headed by Geraldine Page (This is her Oscar winning role.)  But the surprise is Rebecca DeMornay.  She shows that she has than just looks.  Unfortunately she is seldom given the chance to show what is capable of. Well if you are lucky, she does get chances on stage.

It is without a doubt one of my top 5 Favorite Movies. Ms Page is absolutely outstanding as Carrie Watts. The oscar she received for the role was well deserved. Like a review before said, Ms Page had nuances of a southern lady down pat. I could have sworn that she was my grandmother, right down to the hymn singing. I do wish some of the other cast had won for supporting actors. All played their parts so well.

Now my reasons for liking this movies so much is:

1. A movie about Southerners in which Southeners are cast in a positive manner, not as a bunch of racist and rednecks.

2. The acting and script is simply outstanding.

3. A story that just about everyone can relate to on some level. Everyone that lives long enough on this earth will eventually have their own Bountiful that they would love to go back too, if just for one last time.

4. A movie where every other word isn't a 'F-bomb'.

5. LOVE the music. How many times have I heard/sang 'Softly and Tenderly' when the invitation was given at the end of the sermon, but the version in this movie just moves you. If it doesn't, you really need to 'check' yourself...and soon.

6. A movie where religion plays a part without being 'preachy'.

Any person who's lived in the country but has experienced city life will, I think, appreciate this movie.

714060,4,6303832601,"It's easy to see by some of these older reviews that this is a long-awaited release. I've had the VHS for years and I was happy to see the DVD available, and at a cheap price. Unfortunately, that price also meant that I wasn't going to see the extras that I have now come to expect from all DVDs.

Geraldine Page won the Oscar for her role here, and she was up against Whoopi Goldberg's powerful performance in The Color Purple. They had it in for Spielberg, anyway, but at least you could say that Ms. Page's win was not a sympathy vote. She was brilliant as Carrie Watts. Fans of Bette Midler may recognize John Heard, who plays Carrie's impotent but sympathetic son as CeCe Bloom's husband in the film classic, ""Beaches"", which has also been re-released on DVD.

I think a word or two has to be said about the haunting theme song, ""Softly and Tenderly"", sung so beautifully by gospel legend Cynthia Clawson. It appears on her album ""Immortal"", which by now may be available on CD from her website. But every time I drive to Texas and see the bluebonnets by the side of the road, I think of Ms. Clawson's beautiful voice. My wish for this DVD would have been for them to explain, in the relatively short ""making-of"" documentary, the music choices and how this song and this singer came to be chosen. It was an excellent decision, however it came about.

The quality of the DVD was not quite up to standard in my opinion. It looks as if they just recorded it straight off the tape without any cleanup, colors seem dark and muddied in places. I had hoped this classic film would have been treated with better respect when it came time to digitize it. That having been said, four stars is a good score, and it's better to have it in digital form than not at all, even though I think I'll be hanging on to my VHS version.

If there are any youngsters (under 30) who haven't seen this film or who were very young when this came out but love their grandmother or great-grandmother, they are in for a treat. Maybe they will come to view aging people with a little more compassion if they haven't been before now.

714061,5,6303832601,"This wonderfully heart-warming movie is finally on DVD. Based on the 50 year old play by Horton Foote, it tells of an elderly woman's quest to return one last time to her childhood home. Knowing her life is coming to a close, she gets on a Greyhound bus heading for a town (Bountiful, Texas) that no longer exists. Chased by her weakling of a son (John Heard) and his shrewish wife (Carlin Glynn), accompanied along the way by a gentle and kindly young lady (the lovely Rebecca De Mornay), who acts almost like her guardian angel, and framed at beginning and end by Cynthia Clawson's rendition of the hymn ""Softly and Tenderly"", ""Trip to Bountiful"" is truly an American classic. Geraldine Page deservedly won an Academy Award for this at the end of a long and illustrious career.

MGM has released this on a double-sided DVD with the original 1.85:1 theatrical version (anamorphic) on one side and a fullscreen version (either open-matte or extracted from a super35) on the other. Picture quality is excellent with rich, natural colors and good black levels. There is very little dirt, the picture looks quite immaculate. Sound is the original 2.0 Mono but with excellent fidelity. My only disappointment is that this would have been the perfect opportunity to release a Special 20th Anniversary Edition. But I suppose MGM figured there would be no market for that. Shame. Still, we do have a 22 minute, brand new documentary entitled ""Return to Bountiful"" and the original theatrical trailer.

Geraldine Page literally takes your breath away with her performance. John Heard as her son, Ludie, is mesmerizing. I believe that the film is a story about the longing each and every one of us have in our hearts for a better place, a safer place, a more secure place - a home remembered. There is something absolutely primal about the story as the viewer sits literally on the edge of their seat wanting so very much for Mrs. Watts to complete her journey.

I read 'flawless' in a number of the other reviews and that is truly how to discribe her performance in this film.  Great supporting cast too.  I grew up in a lot of different areas of the country and totally identified with Carrie Watts and her desire to return home.

I own every single Geraldine Page movie ever released; she is my favorite actress of all time!  And ""The Trip To Bountiful"" is my FAVORITE film of all time, as well.  Why?  Because when you watch this film, it's not like you're watching a movie at all, it's like you are experiencing the heartache of a lifetime, the dreams, the illusions, the sadness and the happiness,truth and also the lies that compose a lifetime.  What Geraldine Page does with the main character, Carrie Watts, is nothing short of astonishing.  She creates a living breathing woman who has yearned to go home for twenty years after having been cooped up in the city all this time.  And her weak son, her loud, rude and hurtful daughter-in-law (Why Carlin Glynn didn't win Best Supporting Actress, or at least earn a nomination for this role is beyond me) and the beautiful, polite, sweet girl portrayed by Rebecca DeMornay...each of these important supporting roles contributes something substantial to the film...however, this is a Geraldine Page film all the way.  Her mannerisms, the way she moves, speaks, sings, falls onto a sofa, or into the arms of a sheriff...ANYTHING she does is virtuoso, beyond the measure of good acting...it is sublime and perfect.  This movie, so sentimental and charming, is also perfect.  I have seen it about 50 times, and I cannot wait until it's out on DVD!  I can't believe it's taken this long.  But thank you, Powers That Be, for releasing this film on April 12th.

So without telling anyone she goes down to the bus station and plunks what little money she has (is allowed to have) down on a ticket and is off on her little odyssey. Much of her life and heartbreak is told in flashbacks while she's on the bus, either in dream sequences or as she talks to passengers.
