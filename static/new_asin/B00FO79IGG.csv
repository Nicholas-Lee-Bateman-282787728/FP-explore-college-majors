6016184,5,B00FO79IGG,"When I ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bing-Crosby-The-Television-Specials-Volume-2-The-Christmas-Specials/dp/B0041EVYYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bing Crosby: The Television Specials Volume 2- The Christmas Specials</a>, I decided to go ahead and order Volume 1.  Like the Christmas set, this two-DVD collection features four of Bing's TV specials - two per disc - with bonus material on each DVD.

Disc 1 contains Bing's first special, a half-hour show that aired on CBS on January 3, 1954.  It was modeled after Crosby's CBS radio show, and featured pianist Buddy Cole, guitarist Perry Botkin, Jud Conlon's Rhythmaires (who also worked with Stan Freberg), John Scott Trotter And His Orchestra, and special guests Jack Benny and actress/dancer Sheree North, who plays Benny's ""girlfriend"" in a running sketch, and then dances to Count Basie's ""One O'Clock Jump.""  The second special, ""The Bing Crosby Oldsmobile Show,"" aired on September 29, 1959, also on CBS, I believe, and featured all-time greats Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and Peggy Lee, pianists George Shearing, Paul Smith, and Joe Buskin, and The Tom Hansen Dancers (of RED SKELTON SHOW fame).  This is a terrific special.

Bonus material on Disc 1 includes a special episode of the 1952 religious series THE CHRISTOPHERS, featuring Bing, Bob Hope, Phil Harris, legendary golfer Ben Hogan (who had just recently recovered from injuries suffered in a serious car accident), and future Baseball Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Bing was a minority owner of the Pirates until his death (today, with the Baltimore Orioles breaking their streak of 14 straight losing seasons in 2012, with three more winning seasons (plus one .500 season) and two more postseason appearances after that, the once-and-future-woeful Pirates had MLB's longest streak of consecutive losing seasons (20), which finally ended in 2013, as the Buccos beat the Cincinnati Reds in the NL Wild Card Game, but lost (in five games) to the eventual NL Champion St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series). In 2014, the Pirates were the National League Wild Card again, but lost the Wild Card qualifying game to the eventual World Series Champion San Francisco Giants. In 2015, the Pirates again qualified for the NL Wild Card, but lost to everybody's favorite underdogs, the Chicago Cubs, who beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS, but lost the NLCS to the New York Mets, who in turn lost the World Series to the Kansas City Royals. In 2016, the Pirates failed to make the postseason, finishing third in the NL Central with a record of 78-83, 25 games behind the World Champion Cubs. In 2017, both the Pirates and the Orioles finished with identical 75-87 records; the Buccos were fourth in the NL Central, ahead of only the Cincinnati Reds; the O's finished last in the AL East - their first losing season since 2011.

Also included are a 1954 interview with golfer Jimmy Demaret, in which Bing talks about his charity golf tournament (it was Crosby's first color television appearance), and a 1962 local television interview with KGMB-TV in Honululu, where Bing and his family were just finishing a Hawaiian vacation and were on their way back to California.

Disc 2 features an ABC special from May 14, 1962, featuring Bing's son Gary, Pete Fountain, Bob Hope, The Smothers Brothers, and Edie Adams, who had recently lost her husband, Ernie Kovacs, in a car accident (a Chevrolet Corvair, as legend has it).  The second special, the only one that I remember seeing on TV, and the only color special on this collection, is from  April 13, 1970, on NBC, and was titled ""Cooling It,"" sponsored by the Carrier air conditioning company.  Guests included Bernadette Peters, who was making the rounds of all the variety shows in those days, most notably THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW, Dean Martin, and the very funny Flip Wilson, who would launch his own NBC variety series that fall.  Interestingly, both the 1962 and 1970 specials have a physical-fitness/leisure-time theme.

Bonus material on Disc 2 includes a 1964 commercial spot for the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) Company's Thermo-Fax copier, who sponsored Bing's golf tournament.  Bing was also a major 3M investor, as well as in other technology companies like the Ampex Corporation, who, in addition to audio tape recorders, developed the first home video tape recorder (reel-to-reel, not cassette).  Although Bing and Elvis Presley both owned one of these early VTRs (Elvis' recorder is on display at Graceland), the idea never caught on, and it was left to Japanese and European manufacturers to develop the later VCR and DVD recorders/players, as well as HD DVD (which flopped) and Blu-ray players (Blu-ray recorders are reportedly available in Japan, but piracy concerns may prevent their marketing in the U.S., except as part of high-end TV sets).  There is also a 1967 at-home interview with Bing, done for the Australian TV series GIRL TALK, with hostess Hazel Phillips (not to be confused with the U.S. TV series of the same name, hosted by Virginia Graham).

As with VOLUME 2, picture and sound quality are absolutely amazing, considering the age of the shows.  The source materials were well-preserved by the Crosby estate, and Kathryn Crosby, DVD producer Robert S. Bader, and Bing Crosby Enterprises have done a wonderful job with both sets, which are worth having and highly recommended.

In addition to more of Bing's specials (he did 30 in all, but never a regular weekly series, except for a 1964-65 ABC sitcom, and his frequent appearances as host on THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE on ABC). I'd love to see ABC (or whoever owns the rights) put together a HOLLYWOOD PALACE DVD box set or two, not only of Bing's shows, but of others, if legal and musical clearances can be obtained.",1354924800,10,5870,5.165437302423604
6016185,4,B00FO79IGG,"This is classic television, and well worth your time and money.  On disc 1 a special treat is from a Christophers (Catholic) television program, where Bing is joined by Bob Hope, Phil Harris, and the renown golfer Ben Hogan, who talks about his nearly fatal traffic accident and his comeback in golfing circles.  It's quite inspiring, though Hope is sometimes a bit inappropriately funny.  Bing sings ""One Little Candle"", and notes that it's really Perry Como's tune.  ""The Bing Crosby Show"" (1954) is in unusually pristine condition in terms of audio and picture.  It was Crosby's first television special, and only 30 minutes in length.  Bing is in fine voice, particularly for ""It Had To Be You"", with Buddy Cole at the piano.  A surprising number was ""Changing Partners"", a hit for Patti Page.  Interesting that Bing was lip-syncing on at least some of the numbers.  Jack Benny provides the comedy, with his ""girlfriend"" Sheree North, and Benny is at his best here.  The 1959 Crosby special is very interesting.  During the opening number, which was certainly not the highlight of the show, I sat there thinking - wow...Crosby, Sinatra, Peggy Lee, and Louis Armstrong!  You don't see television like that very often.  Bing's opening number was swinging and he was in fine voice, and interestingly the excellent musical arrangements were by Axel Stordahl, who had been so influential in Sinatra's early career.  Sinatra's solo was moody, Lee's typically wonderful.  Sinatra and Bing chat for a while, and it's comfortable and clever.  The piano medley with the three singers is quite striking, although there are some microphone limitations.  Armstrong performs a classic rendition of ""Mack The Knife"".  There's a unique dance number and Bing and Peggy do a song all based on the beatnik culture.  The finale of the show is jazz.  I couldn't help but wonder if this was out of sync with the public's taste in 1959, but Bing loved jazz and he seemed to revel in this segment.  A highlight of the segment was Peggy Lee's rendition of ""Some Of These Days"".

On disc 2 I was especially interested in ""Bing Crosby: Cooling It"".  But, it's almost always a mistake when someone gets the idea that a master entertainer needs to be made to look young.  Usually, the effort just makes them look out of fashion, and for me, that's what happened here.  Bing was 67 when he made this special, but he looked well, seemed fit, and was in relatively fine voice.  Unfortunately, the ""bare stage look"" and cheap graphics detracted from the show, particularly during the long opening number.  You can also see Bing lip-sinking on a couple of the numbers.  We are reminded here that Flip Wilson was a very talented monologist.  Bernadette Peters - why?  Although the duet with Bing and Bernadette (""Turn Around"") was nicely done.  The early skits had no punch, but the piece where Dean Martin is management, Flip Wilson is labor (as Geraldine), and Bing is the mediator - well, Flip had Dean and Bing (and me) in near hysterics.  Bing and Dean's duet medley was typical of the genre, but it's clear these two were smooth masters with a natural chemistry; nicely done.  Not sure how relevant Bing looked during the closing number - ""A New World Coming"".  The ""Bing Crosby:  1962 Special"" is pleasant and began with an upbeat opening number, a variation of ""America"" from ""West Side Story"".  That was followed by Bing and buddy Bob Hope reminiscing about the ""Road"" pictures; they do a nice rendition of ""Teamwork"".  A production number by Edie Adams follows; this special was filmed just 4 months after the death of her husband, Ernie Kovak.  Bing was in good voice for a solo number, although note how his famous ears stick out in the black background.  There's a segment with jazz musician Pete Fountain, although the show's orchestra is conducted by David Rose.  Bing reprises ""Play A Simple Melody"" with son Gary (who otherwise shows how limited his vocal range was).  The finale of the shows is built around a skit about ""Camp Carefree"", and includes a stint by the Smothers Brothers, just one year after their debut on Jack Parr's show.  Bing and Gary also do ""Zing Zing Zing A Little Zong"" nicely.  There are two extras on the disc.  On the first, Bing is in fine voice for a commercial for Thermofax.  And then he's interviewed by an Australian television crew at his home in San Francisco, where he comes across very relaxed, a bit on the serious side, and shows a rather modest temperament.  It's interesting that the film crew could only film outside on the lawn.
