8377244,4,B000NOUIAU,"A typical Madhur Bhandarkar flick with the lives of a small sect of professionals as the subject. The traffic signal includes a microcosm of people who derive their daily livelihoods from it. There are beggars, prostitutes, tricksters, eunuchs and others who sell clothes, flowers and trinkets who owe hafta to the Signal Manager, Silsila. Kunal Khemu, Ranveer Shourie and Konkana Sen perform as expected. Life goes on through ups and downs but the movie ends on a sad note, as expected from Bhandarkar. But the movie entertains you throughout, especially with the Bambaiyya lingo, at the same time makes you think about people you normally never do.",1304035200,,650,5.08411214953271
8377245,5,B000NOUIAU,"From now on I will look at beggars in Mumbai and Delhi quite differently. An astonishing film. Fast, touching, heart wrenching, heart warming. Good music. The ending is slightly disappointing and sappy. Excellent ensemble acting. I just have to mention a few of the actors: Ranvir Shorey as drug addict Dominic, Kunal Khemu as Silsila (with help from the make-up department a little less glamorous) and Konkona Sen Sharma as prostitute Noorie. Not your typical Bollywood stuff. See it!",1174003200,,485,5.151898734177215
