1995952,5,B0001FGBZM,"I bought this collection for ""The Time of Their Lives,"" which I had seen several times; it is my favorite of the Abbott and Costello movies, very high on my general list of beloved ghost storiesl. As an A&C, I like it especially because Bud gets a meatier part than usual, playing both the villain of the Revolutionary War story and a much friendlier descendant. In fact, it plays not so much like the usual vehicle for the comedy team, as a ghost-story movie in which other actors might have had the leading roles -- but I'm awfully glad they went to A&C. I also wanted ""Little Giant,"" which I had never seen: having finally seen it, I like it, though not as much as ""The Time of Their Lives."" Again, Bud gets a double part, one role a scoundrel, the other a more amiable type. As simple straight man (called the real key to any comedy team's success), Bud was inimitable; but it's good to have this evidence that he could have done a lot more with his skill.

1995962,5,B0001FGBZM,"Pros: The inclusion of their greatest film, The Time of Their Lives, first time on DVD

Cons: None

I grew up with a fondness for the comedic genius of the American legendary duo, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Lou Costello was simple, short, and pudgy and the one who provided the slap stick routines with his loveable manner. Bud Abbott was the straight man; he's the reason why you'd laugh most of the time at their comedy. You would need Bud's facial expression reacting to Lou's non-stop silliness in every situation.

The pair made what seems like countless comedy films starting in the early 1940s. This is the second volume in a DVD series of four volumes. Each volume contains eight films which total approximately ten hours of hilarious entertainment. This four part series contains almost all of their movies which makes it a must have. If you love comedy, then Abbott & Costello is just about the best place to see the craft perfected by a couple of real professionals.

Below is a representation of most of the films found on these two DVDs, the highs and the lows. Enjoy.

Hit the Ice (1943) - Directed by Charles Lamont
Bud (Flash) and Lou (Tubby) play two freelance photographers who accidentally get framed for a bank robbery, while the real criminals make their escape with the loot and also two kidnapped friends. The movie has the usual bellyaching laughs, but more than its share of boring musical numbers, four alone from Ginny Simms who portrays Marcia Manning.
82 minutes

In Society (1944) - Directed by Jean Yarbrough
Bud and Lou play Eddie and Albert, two plumbers who were hired to fix a leaky faucet of an affluent man's apartment. The two are mistaken as upscale well-to-do plumbers instead of the incompetent boobs they really are. They get invited to a swanky party and it's not without its hilarious moments. My favorite part of the movie is when the two were delivering hats and were in need of directions to Bagel Street. The question Can you tell me how to get to Bagel Street?"" results in hilarious conversations with the different people on the street.
75 minutes.

Here Comes the Co-Eds (1945) - Directed by Jean Yarbrough
Abbott and Costello are back in college as janitors in a girls only university. They play Slats and Oliver, and co-star Lon Chaney, Jr. as Johnson also does a fair share of delivering up the laughs. Lou Costello (Oliver) finds himself competing in a miss-matched wrestling competition and also posing as a female basketball player. There are plenty of laughs in this film, but the plot is sub-par and you may find yourself skipping ahead to all the funny one-liners instead of watching the movie through.
One of the longest films they have running at 90 minutes.

The Naughty Nineties (1945) - Directed by Jean Yarbrough
Dexter (Abbott) and Sebastian (Costello) work on a showboat in the 1890s. When the captain of the ""River Queen"" loses the boat in a poker game in a crooked casino, the pair try and get it back from the crooks who only wish to turn the showboat into a floating casino. The pair still work on the casino and do a bunch of acts, including the famous ""Who's on First?"" routine. They have already included the routine in the first film they made together One Night in the Tropics, but it's still funny to watch here.

Little Giant (1946) - Directed by William A. Seiter
Little Giants starts off slow and mediocre and it pretty much stays at the same level throughout the rest of the film. Lou Costello plays Benny Miller, a farm boy from Cucamonga, California who lives with his mother and has big dreams of making it rich as a salesman. He makes his way to Los Angeles to work as a vacuum salesman. Bud Abbott has a dual role as mean Mr. Morrison, head of Hercules Vacuums, and his cousin T.S. Chandler who runs another vacuum rig. Benny is such a terrible salesman until his co-workers convince him that he could read minds.

The Time of Their Lives (1946) - Directed by Charles Barton
This is my favorite movie from Abbott and Costello. The film's first half is set in the 1700s during the time of the Revolutionary War. Lou Costello's character, Horatio is a tinker. He and Tom Danbury's wife, Melody are mistaken for traitors, killed and their bodies were thrown into a well, and cursed for all eternity to be bound to the acres of the land that surrounds Danbury Mansion. The house and land are virtually forgotten until 1946, when the house is restored and people move in. One of the people that move in is Bud Abbott's character, Dr. Ralph Greenway, a descendant of the hated Cuthbert Greenway from the 1700s. The ghosts give him the most grief by spooking and haunting him, but also their guests. The ghosts and the living must combine efforts to clear the good names of Horatio and Melody because they are not traitors after all. During a seance while they are communicating, they devise a plan to unravel the mystery and free the souls of Horatio and Melody from the land.

These DVD box sets are a steal considering that you get eight classic films. If you really try you can pick up each volume for about $15. My six year old son is already deciding to sit down and watch these movies with me, and he enjoys the comedy as well. The films contained in this volume are:

1. Hit the Ice
2. Society
3. Here Come the Co-Eds
4. The Naughty Nineties
5. Little Giant
6. The Time of Their Lives
7. Buck Privates Come Home
8. The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap",1457222400,2,5435,4.585993820803296

1996000,5,B0001FGBZM,"This set would have been worth it just for ""In Society"" alone. That film quickly shot up to my favorites list after watching it for the first time--standout bits include ""blow the horn"" where Lou gets into it with a hot tempered cop and the fall down funny Susquehana Hat Company scene. Of course, Bud and Lou's misadventures trying to fix some poor guy's plumbing is not to be missed either.

All the films on this set are not of the 5 star quality--but that's to be expected of any comedy team that made as many films as A & C did. The last movie on the collection, ""The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap"" definitely rates as one of the lesser Bud & Lou features--not shocking given that it's a western and I usually find that whenever any of my favorite comedians do westerns, generally the results are mixed--see the Marx Brothers in ""Go West"" or a few of the Three Stooges western comedies.

Perhaps the most famous film on this set--or at least the one that fans seemed to praise to the high heavens--is ""The Naughty Nineties."" Count me as one of those fans who thought the film fell well short of all the bouquets that have been thrown at it over the years.

Not that I'm saying it's a bad movie--far from it--but it definitely seems this particular film gets points just because it's the only A & C movie that has the complete ""Who's on First"" routine.

""Buck Privates Come Home"" might have been the first feature made after Universal Pictures became ""Universal-International""--I'm not sure if that's the case, but it is the first one to feature the new UI logo at the beginning, so it's sort of a milestone in that regard. It's also the rare sequel that tops the original. The biggest laughs are during the scene where Lou is caught up on a clothesline and gets caught in a tug of war between Bud & some irate husband.

I also wanted to add that I experienced no technical issues with this volume in regards to movies freezing or not playing--unlike Volume 3 which has given quite a few people hell.

Overall--if you're an Abbott and Costello fan--then I would say this set is highly recommended.

My son is 24 and I was so surprised at how much he loved these movies. He laughed and said to me ""These movies are so good mom, they aren't like the movies today. They are just good clean fun"" And then he told me that we should start watching more movies like this together. That just made me so happy that my son and I could sit and watch some movies and spend some quality time together. Kids these days don't really care about spending time with mom and dad. So...when I found this I was delighted, especially the price. I hope that they will be in good condition as I am giving them to him as a surprise.

1996059,4,B0001FGBZM,"I have been watching some of the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello movies on the ThisTV digital subchannel.  They intrigued me, so I decided to purchase this set.  The first shipment had a defective first disc (the first movie on both sides skipped, the second movie on both sides did not play at all on either of my DVD players), so I returned it to Amazon and got a replacement, which worked fine.

The four movies on disc 1 (HIT THE ICE, IN SOCIETY, HERE COME THE CO-EDS, and THE NAUGHTY NINETIES) are musical comedies, more or less.  Of the four movies on disc 2, LITTLE GIANT and THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES are what I would consider ""dramedies""; while they have plenty of funny moments, Bud and Lou play separate roles and show their dramatic acting talents, particularly Costello.  BUCK PRIVATES COME HOME (a sequel to BUCK PRIVATES) is a military comedy; THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP is a Western.

A number of well-known supporting players appear in these pictures, including Marion Hutton (Glenn Miller's girl vocalist), Arthur Treacher (British character actor and Merv Griffin's '60s sidekick), George Dolenz (Micky's dad), Peggy Ryan (the secretary in the original ""Hawaii Five-O"" and a fabulous tap dancer - see HERE COME THE CO-EDS), Milburn Stone (Doc of ""Gunsmoke"" fame), and many others.

My two favorites are HERE COME THE CO-EDS and THE NAUGHTY NINETIES (which has the complete version of A&C's ""Who's on First"" routine, which never gets old - the YouTube version is from the A&C TV series, I believe).  I enjoyed all of the pictures, though.

I do wish that Universal would release at least some of these pictures as individual DVDs.  If someone is only interested in owning, say, THE NAUGHTY NINETIES, why should they have to purchase seven other movies that they are not interested in?

I'm going to check the other volumes in the series to see if they are worthwhile.",1326499200,,1883,4.745398773006135
1996060,5,B0001FGBZM,"Abbott&Costello are one of the best comedy acts ever tied with The Three Stooges and The Marx Brothers. This collection some of their best and classic films, which are The Naughty Nineties, Time of Their Lives and Buck Privates Come Home. The first two didn't seem like their all films, due to them having more focus on other characters then Abbott&Costello. All movies are in Black&White and are in Full Screen formant. I was also impressed on how great quality the video was and all the movies played fine with no problem at all.

1996067,5,B0001FGBZM,"The Best of Abbott and Costello, Volume 2

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were the best comedy team in the movies of the 1940s and early 1950s. They were the best movie comedy team in 20th century America! There were other series of comic movies: Blondie and Dagwood, Hope and Crosby, Martin and Lewis. Aside from their physical differences, tall and thin versus short and stout (like Laurel and Hardy), their movies had a story that was relevant to society. The stories ranged over various geographic locations. Most of their films aged well. A movie is only as good as its story, so there are variations. The stories tell of the adventures of ordinary people and their interactions with society. [Was this why Jerry Seinfeld chose co-actors who were tall and thin, and short and stout?]

Some of their movies became part of the ""public domain"" and are not in this series. Perhaps someday we will see these collected on a new volume. One reason for their success is that movie audiences peaked during their time. There are no recurring comedy series today. Talent seems to have gone into TV shows since the 1950s. There were comedy TV shows in the 1950s that were also funny (Red Skelton, ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Honeymooners"", etc.), but few comedy shows since the 1960s. The corporate media prefers dramas that stress crime and punishment. Does this produce a fear that best sells products? This lists the eight films on two double-sided DVDs. You can find detailed descriptions of each movie elsewhere.

While this ""Best Of"" set seemed like a real bargain, it was a heartbreak to constantly be frustrated by the freezing-up of the disc. I started and stopped so many times that I finally gave up.

Whatever money Universal made on these old films would surely warrant releasing them again as a quality item worth the purchase price. I can't imagine the thought process behind putting the studio's name on something this badly done. These movies -- every single one -- are just great!

Abbott often is the slicker of the two but he is often a patsy in his own way. This volume contains some of their more creative films, like THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES and LITTLE GIANT. Children enjoy the comedy and fun and adults can be transported back to the Saturday afternoons of their youth, when these films were shown on television.

The Best of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello is exactly what the title implies.  The sound and picture quality is excellent.  ""The Time of Their Lives"" is worth the price of admission for this 8 movie on its own, but to also get ""Hit The Ice"", ""Little Giant""... anyone who enjoys Abbott and Costello will appreciate this quality release.  The package has Two double-sided DVDs which contain two movies per side.  Identifying which movies are on which discs is a bit tricky but the quality does not disappoint.

Universal Studios definitely has my kudos for ""The Franchise Collection"" of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.  The quality of the release as well as the content and production of these films make this collection worth owning.",1218844800,,1244,6.239766081871345

This one is wonderfully charming for us, because it contains several movies by Abbott and Costello that we had never seen before. And of course, since it contains the Naughty Nineties, You get the wonderful routine about who's on first. One of the things that we enjoy so much about these movies is that they are accessible to my nine-year-old daughter. She absolutely enjoys them and watches them over and over again. When you consider some of the things she could be watching on TV, the thought of her watching Abbott and Costello instead is absolutely thrilling.

1996090,4,B0001FGBZM,"It'd be a stretch to say that Abbott and Costello were the greatest comic actors ever, but they did put out a series of films that were both financially successful and a lot of fun to watch.  Volume 2 of the Abbott and Costello Franchise Collection provides eight movies featuring the pair and demonstrates how consistently entertaining they could be.

On Disc One, Side One is Hit The Ice and In Society.  Hit the Ice has the two accused of bank robbery.  Fleeing the police, they wind up at the same ski lodge where the real crooks are.  This one concludes with a ski chase unlike any in a James Bond movie.  In Society has the pair as plumbers accidentally invited to a country estate where, during a weekend party, a valuable painting is to be unveiled.  When the painting is stolen, trouble is sure to follow, ending up with another chase, this time involving a fire truck.

On Disc One, Side Two is Here Come the Co-Eds and The Naughty Nineties.  In the former, Bud and Lou wind up working at a women's college.  To raise funds to save the school, they bet on the basketball team, and Lou winds up impersonating one of the players.  This one also has Lon Chaney,  The Naughty Nineties has Bud and Lou trying to save a riverboat from falling into the hands of crooks.  This one is especially notable for having the full ""Who's on First"" routine, their single most well known bit of comedy.

Disc Two, Side One features a couple of the most unusual A&C movies, as the pair appear in the movies, but rarely together.  In Little Giant, Lou is an aspiring vacuum cleaner salesman and Bud has a pair of minor roles as two of Lou's bosses.  A showcase for Lou Costello, it has more sentimentality than most of their movies.  In The Time of Their Lives, Lou actually dies.  He spends most of the movie as a ghost from the Revolution out to clear his name.  Bud once again has dual roles, one in the 1780s and one in the 1940s.

Disc Two, Side Two starts with Buck Privates Come Home, a sequel to the first movie featuring them, Buck Privates.  The pair come back from the war with a little orphan girl, and the two jump through hoops trying to keep her from being deported back to France.  The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap is a western.  Lou apparently kills a man (of course, it's a frame-up) and is punished by having to take care of the dead man's fearsome wife and kids.  This has the unusual effect of making him the toughest person in Wagon Gap:  no one is willing to kill him lest they be stuck with the widow instead.

While none of these are excellent movies, none are bad either.  In fact, they are all above average and the set rates four stars.  If you've never seen Abbott and Costello, this collection is a good place to start.",1199577600,3,2737,4.366336633663367

However it is the films themselves that have everlasting appeal. Lou Costello can still bring a tear to my eye and he almost caused my 8 yr old stepson to have to change his pants. It's amazing to see that this fabuluous comedy duo can still have the same affect on audiences this many years on.

1996116,3,B0001FGBZM,"The boys are back with a second set of eight films from 1943 to 1947.  They are on two double sided DVD's with two films on each side.  And if you like the boys, these are good films (not their best).

***Hit the Ice - Bud and Lou are on the run and end up at a resort in Sun Valley.  They get jobs at the resort but the crooks follow.  The film ends up with a typical but still funny ski chase.

**In Society - Bud and Lou are two incompetent plumbers who are called to fix a noisy toilet at a society home during a costume party.  They and their female taxi driver friend are mistaken for guests and are invited to a weekend in the county for the unveiling of a painting called ""The Plunger"".  When the painting is stolen, the boys find it.  Very typical and not that funny.

***Here Comes the Co-ed's - Bud and Lou are employed at an all girl college and kaos ensues.  Of course, the college has financial  woes and in the end, the boys save the college.

***Naughty Nineties - Bud and Lou's version of Show Boat.  Bud is a bad actor and Lou is the bumbling stagehand.  The river boat captain loses it to gamblers who turn it into a crooked casino.  Bud and Lou come to the rescue with what is becoming their typical chase scene (but this time it works perfectly.)  Also, they perform ""Who's on First"".

****Little Giant - Lou is his typical simpleton who aspires to be a great salesman.  He leaves the farm and goes to the big city and gets a job as a door to door vacuum cleaner salesman for a company run by a corrupt Bud.  After a disastrous day Lou is exiled to the Fresno office run by Bud's twin brother who is honest.  By accident, Lou becomes the salesman of the year and returns to Los Angeles in triumph.  And of course, he uncovers the dishonesty going on, good Bud takes over and Lou returns to the farm and marries his sweetheart.  Very atypical fare and it works.

****The Time of Their Lives - Lou and Marjorie Reynolds are revolutionary patriots killed by accident, branded as traitors and cursed to remain bound to the property until they are proved patriots.  Modern day, the mansion is restored and the new owners have moved in.  Ghosts Lou and Marjorie try to find the letter that will prove them patriots and set their spirits free.  Bud is the man who helped brand them traitors in the past and his distant relative in the present who helps prove them patriots.  This is one their better fares as it different from the typical fare.

****Buck Privates Come Home - The war is over and the boys are coming home (with a little French orphan - who speaks perfect English!).  When she faces deportation, the boys and their friends hide her.  They only thing missing is the Andrew Sisters!

*****The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap - Lou gets credited with killing a bad guy but then is forced to marry his widow and be responsible for her children.  Marjorie Main of Ma Kettle Fame plays the widow and gives a great performance.  Bud plays a con artist that is conned into overseeing that Lou upholds his obligation to the widow and her family.

1996117,5,B0001FGBZM,"I purchased this set as I noticed it included my favourite A & C movie `Time of their Lives` which had never been available before on DVD.  So to get 7 more movies for a price I would have happily paid for that was a great bonus.

The picture and sound quality of all of these films is outstanding and great care has been taken in perfect transfers from excellent, apparently original negative, 35mm material so it is a first class ride throughout.  For A & C that is the only way to travel.

It seems a shame that some reviewers gripe about a lack of extra and should see it another way.  You are buying one movie with 7 first rate features as extras - how about that for value? Remember you are paying less than $1.88 (or around 1) for each of these superb quality movies... I rest my case!

All of these series` discs play fine on my multi region players here in the UK.  Even the slightest finger mark on a disc or dirty players can cause skipping and freezing (just a thought!).

I wanted my children to experience this pair, so they could see how funny simple comedy is without the vulgarities or sexual innuendo.  They still crack me up, and I was happy to see my kids splitting their sides with laughter, just like I used to do when I was their ages.

This is a great deal, to get 8 movies at this price, so I got all 3 volumes.  DVD's work fine.  They fit 2 movies on each side, and each movie has Production Notes in the menu, so you get a historical appreciation for each film.

Because the movies are on both sides of the DVD, they can't print anything on either side, so they printed the disc and side information around the little hole in the center of the DVD (it'll have ""Disc A, Side 1"", for example). Its a little hard to read, so you need to have enough light and hold it close. The information in the box tells you what movies are on which disc and side.

The DVD with ""The Naughty Nineties"" has the most complete version of ""Who's On First"", and its so funny, you can hear the studio crew laughing in the background.",1119484800,7,1152,4.237442922374429

While working at Target, I was pleasantly surprised to discover of the first volumes release and I picked up a copy quite quickly. I did the same with the second volume as well, hoping to be able to enjoy it as much as I did the first. However, I have in no way enjoyed the second volume even a small amount as much as the first due to the fact that I can't even barely get through one movie without some sort of disc error. No matter which dvd player I use, there is a disc error which causes me to miss upwards of ten minutes of the first two movies on Disc 1 side 1. I've even returned the movie two times now and am on my third copy trying to find one that works. They all have the same sort of disc error with the only difference being that the error varies the timing of the error from set to set. It is also becoming harder and harder to exchange it for a new one since many of the stores I have gone to seem to have stopped carrying it, and one employee at a Northridge Suncoast mentioned that he thought there might possibly have been a recall of the volume 2 set. If you are an avid fan of Abbott and Costello, and have the patience to deal with the disc errors, then feel free to buy these movies as they are really great.

1996123,4,B0001FGBZM,"Some of the situations the Hollywood movie machine contrived as vehicles for their stars show their age, often badly. Many of the ""chase"" sequences"" don't hold up at all. The runaway sailboat sequence in ""Here Come the Co-eds"" is an example of this. It has its moments. The close up shots of the live actors and the background footage they're superimposed on don't match each other. Details, things like wind moving fabric around, are missing. Often, the ""halos"" that were left around people when their images were superimposed over stock footage are still present. (It's still not always that easy to get rid of those perfectly even when with a still photograph. Ask someone who's done it.) The problems lie with the special effects. These were the state of the art in their time but are weak by current standards. This list goes on. Archival and stock footage (which was used a lot) is often grainy. Sometimes the resolution of pieces of film being matched is completely different. And so on ... Don't worry too much about all of this. Bud and Lou's comedy has too much too offer to let small technical issues stand in the way of enjoying what they did. The routines they inserted into their films are as fresh today as they were sixty years ago. The timing they had was impeccable; a lot of today's performers could learn from it. Some of the best performances of their routines captured on film are contained in this set. Every one shows how good their timing was. Watch and enjoy.

Hit the Ice ****

When Lou Costello walks into the door that bud Abbott just went through it's funny. When most duos do this it's not as funny, if it's even funny at all. That's timing. You turn on any of these movies knowing this is going to happen a lot. You expect it. You may even know it's coming. But, try to spot it coming. You can't. Their timing was that good. This film has a lot of hilarious sight gags. Lou walks into an inordinate amount of doors and walls. Watch Ginny Simms almost lose it when Lou realizes she's the one handing him his food. It was probably the closest thing to a take with her holding a straight face they could get. And the film contains a great version of ""pack the grip"".

In Society ***

Bud and Lou as plumbers: what trouble can they get into here? Watch and find out, but don't drink anything while the scene plays. It'll be coming up your nose when you break out laughing.

Here Come the Co-Eds ***

This one is a bit uneven. The comedy portions are excellent. Look for what's probably the best rendition of ""Jonah and the Whale"" on film. The basketball game is hilarious. What hurts the film are  some it's musical segments. Evelyn Silverstone's (Evelyn and her Magic Violin) solo spot is fine-she was an excellent violinist-but Phil Spitalny and his All-Girl Orchestra perform material that's beyond dreadful.

The Naughty Nineties ****

""Who's on First"" ...complete! The set was supposed to be silent for this. The cameramen couldn't do it. Listen for them laughing. The ""mirror routine"" is hilarious. And the chase at the end is zany and side splitting. One of their very best. This one is reviewed separately. It's that good.

Little Giant ****

Bud is splendid as the film's villain. He makes himself very easy to dislike. This film is more heart warming than hilarious though. That's not to say it isn't funny. Some parts are very funny. The sudden explosion of sales Lou has and his colleagues reaction to it is hilarious. He still surprises viewers constantly with the klutziness he gave to all his characters. And he proves himself as a dramatic actor. His character is one of life's victims and he's one who doesn't deserve to be. When his heart breaks the viewers' hearts break as well.

The Time of Their Lives ****

Bud has dual roles again, this time as both the hero and villain of the piece. He's brilliant in both roles. It's a good example of why Lou felt he was worth 60% of the money the team earned. He really was that good. As for Lou, well who else could be convincing as a ghost who can't figure out how to pass through walls? This film is another good example of why this pair is still finding new generations of fans.

Buck Privates Come Home ****

This film is all heart. The boys try to help a war orphan (not an unrealistic problem) but can't succeed on their own. Look for some touching scenes between Lou and the little girl and count on some fun while the film pokes fun at excessive authority. And enjoy some of the routines. Setting a table will never be the same again.

The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap ***

This one features Marjorie Main of Ma and Pa kettle fame. She was a good comedienne and a good match to play opposite Bud and Lou. The funniest scenes in the movie are where she tries convincing (coercing) Lou into marrying her. His responses to everything she does are classic. Unfortunately some of the scenes where Lou gets to throw his weight around seem forced. Who's at fault there is hard to say but it looks like a decision made by the studio.",1097884800,29,5022,4.519294377067255

I grew up with these movies and now get to share them with another generation.

This is good clean fun comedy that you won't be emabrassed to show to anyone. Never mean spirited or vulgar, just comedy like it was meant to be by two undisputed geniuses of the genre.

Buy this set and enjoy A&C all over again.

Now all I need is a box set of the A&C show from the 50's woth Hilary, Mr Fields, Mr. Bacciagalupe, Mike the cop and Stinky. I can't wait.",1091318400,40,555,4.158878504672897
1996126,5,B0001FGBZM,"This is a great follow up set to ""Abbott & Costello"" Volume 1. Once again the picture and sound are clear and crisp and better than I remember them being on any television broadcast. I now have 8 more movies in my collection for less than I paid for the ""Abbott & Costello meet the Mummy"" DVD, and I don't see that title or A & C meet Captain Kidd on the scheduled volume 3 release. As with volume 1 some reviewers have had more quality issues and disc problems, fortunately I haven't had any so far. As for putting 8 movies on 2 discs, I am not a big fan of this format either. But I think if Universal was to release 8 movies on 4 disc's it would definitely drive the price up. There really aren't any extra's to speak of, some production notes and a few trailers. It sure would be nice to have commentaries from surviving A & C family members to hear their thoughts on one of the best comedy teams ever created. Through the magic of DVD media and these fantastic volumes, new legions of fans are discovering ""Abbott & Costello"" for the first time. If your a fan of Abbott & Costello or have never seen their films you need to buy this set. These movies are hilarious and pure fun for the whole family.

1996129,5,B0001FGBZM,"Some reviewers are having problems with these A&C discs, but like with Volume 1, I have none.  Perhaps Universal has issued a bad batch of discs but I think the player has a lot to do with the final quality.  This set contains several of the team's sleepers.  I have a newfound appreciation for Little Giant and Hit The Ice, which I now consider one of their five funniest films.  I recently introduced A&C to my grandkids and every time we get together they ask for another film, but they don't just sit through one; it's amazing how they have the patience for two or three films one after the other!  I never thought I could draw them away from their video games or other television shows, but A&C continually finds a new generation of fans.  I only hope Universal comes through with a volume four, although it will only contain four or five films:  three regular theatrical issues and The World of Abbott and Costello and perhaps the Seinfeld show.  Let's hope there's ample documentary material and a miracle if the disputed ""It Ain't Hay"" is finally released.",1084492800,3,1064,4.592592592592593

1996131,5,B0001FGBZM,"We all know Abbott & Costello, so no more praise needs to be done for their movies. Well... sure it does!!! It's just like you remember going to the movies for a nickel ;-) or on Sunday mornings with your parents/grandparents. The movies have not changed one bit, and they are still the exact same as I remember them. OUTSTANDING job by the studios to release these. (Now I wish they would release Charlie Chan. That is another story.)
The only downside to this release, is the DVD themselves. There are two DVDs, with two movies on EACH side. I don't like this. With the ""normal"" DVD, the top can get scratched, and it will still play. (The laser uses the bottom.) With this style, scratch the top, and you lost two movies. They should have put them on four discs instead of two.
Also, I have heard that people have had problems playing these DVDs. I did as well; however, I have to admit, I don't have a top or mid line player. Mine is a basement bargain, and it may be the cause, though, it does play other movies with out problems. Sometimes when I put it in, it reads the movie and other times it does not. Just have to fiddle with it to get it going. And on some, I noticed the color fades in and out. That could be the DVD of the movie itself.
Other than that, I am quite thrilled with this release, and I do hope they release all of the Abbott & Costello films, clips, etc soon. And while the studios are reading: Release Charlie Chan and The 3 Stooges!!!!",1084406400,7,1464,4.250896057347671

1996137,3,B0001FGBZM,"The Best Of Abbott & Costello: The Franchise Collection: Vol 2"" effectively gathers together another bumper crop of films that made up the middle of Bud and Lou's tenure at Universal Studios. Highlights on this two disc edition include the whimsical ""The Time Of Their Lives"" (1946), a film not well received in its time, but one which has proven to be an enduring classic in the A&C canon.  Bud plays the dual role of Cuspert Greenway/Dr. Greenway, a footman in servitude to master Tom Danbury during the 1800s and his psychiatrist ancestor set in 1946. Cuspert?s treachery against Horatio (Lou Costello) results in his death and that of Tom?s finance, Mistress Melody (Marjorie Reynolds). From here on the story leaps forward to present day. Horatio and Melody, having been cursed upon their murders as traitors to America?s independence, remain bound to Danbury Acres until crack of doom. But when they begin to haunt Dr. Greenway and his guests living at the refurbished historical landmark, a ray of hope develops that might finally set their spirits free. In ""Here Come The Co-Eds"" (1945)  Bud and Lou are a couple of caretakers, hiding out from the police at Bixby College, an all girl's school. The film features The Hour Of Enchantment, all girl?s orchestra and choir and a riotous basketball game in which Lou, after being hit on the head, believes that he is Daisy Dimple; the world?s greatest female basketball player. In ""Hit The Ice"" (1943) - the boys take off to Sun Valley for skiing, a prospect that falls apart when a mob boss decides to hide out at the same resort. This collection also features a handful of awful films. ""The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap"" (1947) is a genuinely boring film in which Lou attempts to win the heart of a crotchety widow (Marjorie Maine) in order to secure her wealthy fortune, but whose adult children have other ideas.  Lou generally gets abused by everyone in the cast and there?s a genuine strain on the relationship between A&C by this time. In ""The Naughty Nineties"" (1945) Bud and Lou are performers on a riverboat, but the only salvation from this film is an extended version of the now legendary 'Who's On First' skit. (*Footnote: 'Who's on First' is performed in a truncated version in ""One Night In The Tropics"" also. That film is available on ""The Best Of...Vol. One"".) The bad lot of apples reaches its rotten core with ?Little Giant? (1946), a really boring hodge-podge in which Lou is a vacuum cleaner salesman working for Bud. This collection is rounded out by a couple of mediocre productions; ?In Society? (1944), a trifle in which the boys crash a society party to help a chorus girl fall in love with a rich playboy, and ?Buck Privates Come Home? (1947), a rehash of skits from previous films with the tack on of having Bud and Lou smuggle a little French girl back to America after the war.
Over all, the transfers in this collection are a mixed bag in image quality. While some films like ""The Time of Their Lives"" exhibit little to no age related artifacts, others like ""The Wistful Widow..."" have not worn well at all. At its worst you will get a transfer riddled in age related artifacts, minor edge enhancement, mis-registration and considerable film grain. At its best, the picture quality is outstanding - leading me to think that some of these transfers were blessed with a meticulous digital restoration, while others got shafted. The audio for all the films is MONO but very nicely presented.",1083715200,7,3470,4.760797342192691
1996138,5,B0001FGBZM,"These days it is very difficult, if not down right impossible to find quality entertainment these days.  Especially in the field of comedy.  What was once wholesome and good, has been replaced by raunchy and perverted!  However, the good people at Universal have realized this, and answered the call.  The comedy of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello is absolutly remarkable.  They are to comedy what Alfred Hitchcock was to thrillers.
The bits that Bud and Lou have featured in their movies will have you splitting your sides.  However, up until now, they have been very rare on TV and at the local video store.  This collection, vol. 2 contains three of my favorite Abbott and Costello movies:
HIT THE ICE
the boys hide out at the Sun Valley ski lodge, while trying to find the bank robbers who framed them.
THE NAUGHTY NINETIES
The boys try to help Capt. Sam win back the River Queen showboat, after it is taken by Con Artists. (The film features the enitre Who's On First skit!)
THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP
Lou is acused of killing a man, and must take care of the man's childres and wife.
