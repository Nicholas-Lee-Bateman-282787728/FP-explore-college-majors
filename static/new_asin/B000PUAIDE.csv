8193409,4,B000PUAIDE,"The liken series is fun, entertaining, and mostly accurate.  It does depict the stories with slight artistic license, but overall I found it to be highly accurate.  The music is fun and very catchy, and it really helps the kids learn to love the scripture stories.  Some may feel that it takes the scriptures too lightly by making some fun with them, but I found it to be tasteful and appropriate.",1357171200,,397,4.563380281690141
8193410,5,B000PUAIDE,"When McKay Anderson (with Brad Warwood reprising his role as the modern-day teenager who has a mighty change of heart in Episode 2) goes on his mission, he meets a young girl whose imagination is just as musical as that of his little brother's. Her imagination comes in handy, particularly when she faces peer pressure at school. McKay (now Elder Anderson) shares with her the story of how Alma had to decide whether to go along with King Noah and his wicked priests or risk his life by standing up for the prophet Abinadi.

This original, new musical stars Dallyn Vail Bayles as Alma, Frank Gerrish as King Noah, Ken Eklof as Abinadi, Michael Birkeland as Alma's wicked priest trainer, and introduces Lauren Faber as the modern-day girl in whose imagination this musical takes place. Featuring all original songs by Aaron Edson.
