8556544,5,B00AQO1V5S,A 120.00 value. Do NOT be overcharged.,1440201600,,38,4.571428571428571
8556545,5,B00AQO1V5S,This 8 dvd set is worth every penny. Not only does the instructor give hours of in depth lessons in creature design and animation but provides all the hd project files AND a book. Not to mention the box it comes in is pretty awesome looking! For so much material $350 is a real bargain! If you think about it it's $43 per disc AND a free set of prints and a book and a snazzy case! Most classes cost over a thousand so to say this is a bargain is an understatement.,1355961600,2,465,4.010752688172043
