4598248,3,B0058FQRCM,"A rather cheaply done movie.  Has a feel of made-for-TV, unlike much of the quality BBC stuff.  Follows the life of a UK home guard soldier, with an un-needed injection of romance.",1367452800,,180,4.59375
4598249,5,B0058FQRCM,This is a good WW II movie.  Good cast with fine acting.  This is a movie I will keep for viewing in the future.,1363737600,3,112,3.625
4598250,3,B0058FQRCM,"A sweet, simple, not very complex, but satisfying movie. I watched it mainly for Robson, who is one of my most favorite actors (Wire in the Blood is brilliant . . .). Still, three stars is GOOD for this movie, a small, happy-ending movie, which ended just the way I wanted it too! (Maybe a secret 4 stars.)",1361404800,2,306,4.293103448275862
4598251,5,B0058FQRCM,"enjoyed this movie very much.
Having strong British connections we were happy with the video, also the stars. Should enjoy more British movies.",1360195200,,143,5.260869565217392
4598252,5,B0058FQRCM,This DVD movie is very good.  I also shared it w/one of my bosses and she enjoyed it also.  We both like a lot of the British movies & mini-series; we share them back & forth.,1330560000,,175,3.8333333333333335
4598253,4,B0058FQRCM,"Joe Maddison's War was broadcast yesterday, as I type, in Australia. I was moved by the personal drama, and very interested in the Home Guard action. As many other reviewers have commented, the casting is excellent, although Robson Green LOOKS too young to have been in World War I. Kevin Whatley shows his qualities as an actor of principle and pathos.
I am interested in, but question, some of the historical detail, noting another reviewer's sharp-eyed comments on the mis-use of Army-issue Lee Enfield .303 rifles for rank-and-file Home Guard.
I was unable to identify any particular German aircraft in the two (computer-animated) air-raids.
Although I have no formal training or practice in aircraft recognition, it has been an interest of mine for decades. I would have expected a possible Heinkel III or Dornier 217 to be a bit more obvious: or possible a Junkers 88. I was also surprised to see the German planes flying in such regimented formation, and flying so low. But I know some allowances must be made, visually, and conceptually, with CGI animation.
I am also not an expert at recognising anti-aircraft artillery (""ack-ack"", as the British called it then). But the 4.5 inch gun they show seemed more like a 3.8 inch (I may have the calibres mis-stated, doing so from memory, and without checking details on Wikipedia). Nor am I aware that Home Guard troops ever served on active ack-ack duties. Maybe someone else can enlighten us.
Similarly, I do not think that masses formations of German bombers raided England after the end of the Blitz, although small tip-and-run raids were frequent after the Blitz.

I can, however, with confidence explain about the land-mine. This was not the small anti-vehicle or anti-personnel land-mine. It was actually a naval mine, larger than a man, a cylinder (not the classic sphere with detonator-horns) full of explosive. When the Germans wanted to drop the largest possible aerial bomb, during the London Blitz, they had no large bombs (such as the 2000 pound ""cookie"" that Bomber Command used in the latter years of the war). The naval mine was the largest explosive device available. But as it was not contained in a hardened steel case, but was designed to be gently launched from a mine-laying boat and anchored to the sea-bed, waiting for a passing ship's magnetic field to detonate it, when it was dropped from a plane it had to be more softly landed -- by parachute. Although it was then designed to detonate on landing, many landed with fiendish delayed fuses, or broken fuses. Being naval mines, they were then defused (when possible) by Royal Navy personnel: extremely brave men, many of whom were killed in the attempt to defuse such weapons. (See Ivan Southall's classic non-fiction account ""Softly Tread the Brave"": also the TV series ""UXB"" -- Un-exploded Bomb.)

4598254,5,B0058FQRCM,"My husband and I thouroughly enjoyed this movie the first time we saw it, and again yesterday, after about a dozen viewings. It's a realistic portrayal of the home guard, complete with actual WWII footage. The music, the humor, the comraderie, and the limited sappiness all contribute to our enjoyment of the film. Robson Green, Kevin Whately, and  Derek Jacoby all deliver fine performances. We would recommend it enthusiastically.",1320537600,14,432,5.260869565217392
4598255,5,B0058FQRCM,"Wonderful movie that truly captured the feel of the era.  Kevin and Robson were perfect in their roles.  It told a story that could
almost apply to any war and the situations it puts people and their families in difficult times.  Very enjoyable and real not too much
or soppy just very real.  Will watch again, so few gems like this around.",1315785600,10,340,4.435483870967742
4598256,4,B0058FQRCM,"This is a lovely movie and Kevin Whatley shines as Joe Maddison. You can actually see the changes taking
place in his character as the movie progresses. Robson Green is brilliant (as usual). The scenery is so authentic - I lived through some of it so I know.
I strongly recommend this film",1293580800,19,289,4.471698113207547
4598257,5,B0058FQRCM,"This story of the peace time adjustments of 3 WWII veterans stars 3 of
my most favorite British actors. It's a well written script with very high
production values and I enjoyed it a lot. It was nice to see Kevin Whately
doing something other than ""being Lewis"" so successfully. I would watch
Robson Green and Derek Jacobi recite a telephone directory so I was not at all
disappointed by their terrific performances.",1426032000,,416,4.712328767123288

4598259,5,B0058FQRCM,"Great movie. What it must have been like in World War II Britain, and you are too old to serve. What next? Why, THE HOME GUARD. Great acting all around. I give this my highest recommendation. JR",1417737600,,194,4.27027027027027

4598264,4,B0058FQRCM,"Love the actors in this movie. .....good story.....sad, funny,moving.....glad I got it for my collection.  An everyday movie about a not so every day situation.",1388880000,,160,5.4
4598265,5,B0058FQRCM,"With Kevin Wheatley, Robson Green and Mr. Jacobi, how can you miss?  It wasn't what I expected, but it turned out to be a movie that I love, and will be glad to show others.  I'm glad that Kevin W., is the star so that we can see him do what he does so well: make it look so real. This is a sweet story, even in the midst of WW II, and that is something for that timeframe! Would certainly recommend if you like Mr. Wheatley or Robson Green. Someone said in a review said that Robson can't act, well I beg to differ.",1377734400,4,516,3.9047619047619047
4598266,4,B0058FQRCM,"Kevin Whately is one of many people's favorite actors.  Here he is at home in Tyneside, during the second world war.  As a ship builder he will not be drafted; besides, he had already fought at the battle of the Somme and has paid his dues.  When his wife leaves him for a naval officer, he joins the Home Guard with several of his mates, including the excellent Robson Green (from Wire in the Blood).  The local chemist (pharmacist), played by Derek Jacobi, reverts to his old rank of major and suddenly becomes their boss.  In addition to taking a leadership role in the Guard, Joe Maddison meets a new woman.  When his wife returns, with a daughter in hand, Joe must decide whether to divorce her or stay with her.  The local Catholic priest has his own views of course, but Joe is not a Catholic; his wife is.  So where will this go?

This is essentially a small movie with a sweet subject.  It has the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie, except for the A-list actors.  The script is not up to the quality of a Morse or Lewis episode, but Kevin makes the most of relatively average material and shines in the role.  Anyone who likes traditional films will like Joe Maddison's War.  One caveat: there are no subtitles, but there are, of course, heavy Geordie accents.  Turn up the volume and listen very carefully.",1375660800,6,1319,4.441666666666666

Robson Green is hilarious in it...Kevin Whately great acting and played the part well....They should make a tv series of this...would be the Northern version of Dads Army for sure.

8461509,5,B0058FQRCM,"Being a big fan of Foyle's War, I thought this would be an enjoyable movie and wasn't disappointed.  Of course, it helps that I'm also a fan of Kevin Whately (Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis) and Robson Green (Wire In The Blood and Touching Evil).  Interesting story of those who wanted to serve during WWII but were too old for military duty.  I just generally love British entertainment.",1466121600,,393,4.75
