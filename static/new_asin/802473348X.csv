8123799,5,802473348X,"""Baron Prasil"" is a one of my all time favorite fantasy films. This has to be one of the most charming, imaginative, and dreamlike films ever made. The characters in this film are quite romantic (i.e. in an old fashioned chivalrous way), witty, and whimsical. The sets are unique in style, and the creatures that roam the around the Baron's surreal world, are wonderfully rendered.

Whenever I watch this film,  I feel completely swept away by its charming beauty, its light- hearted wit, and by the warm uplifting feeling of viewing director Karel Zeman's brilliant artistic vision completely realized.",1412467200,4,603,5.08080808080808
8123800,5,802473348X,"This is another of the 'archival' prints of fantasy film-maker extraordinaire Karel Zeman's works released by the Karel Zeman Museum in his  Czech homeland.  As such - this film (and its' 2 companion features) provide the best quality visual records, to date, of his masterful efforts.  ""The Fabulous Baron Munchausen"" was released in 1961 and might be considered to be Zeman's 'magnum opus' as it brought together all of his previously utilized cinema magic tricks and added color to the mix!

Based on a fanciful tale penned in 1786 by Gottfried August Burger the story-line follows the fantastic adventures of the titular Baron Von Munchasuen  as he encounters an earth astronaut on the moon - mistakenly assumes that the astronaut is a 'moon man' and transports him back to 18th century earth to introduce him to earthly ways.  Whilst initially visiting a Turkish Sultan both of the men are smitten with romantic yearnings for a captive princess (whom they 'liberate') and much of the subsequent narrative and action is based on the rivalry of the two men for her affections, and the attempts made by the Sultan to retrieve his female prize!  A highlight of the 'chase' involves the Baron being swallowed by a great 'fish' and carried inside it around the world until he is finally freed when the creature is harpooned by whalers.  All of this amazing tale is graphically depicted via Zeman's 'trademark' style of imagery that mimics the look of old engraved book illustrations and features numerous examples of his sly satirical visual puns and comments upon the absurdity of certain political institutions and the human condition, in general.

This film is a visual treat from beginning to end and features scene after scene of opulent compositions and incredibly textured detail.  It has been noted that (Monty Python alumni) Director Terry Gilliam was greatly influenced in his (1988) re-telling of the Baron Munchausen tale by Zeman's version, and many of the Python-esque animated graphics also bear a striking resemblance to Zeman's images and filmic techniques.

It should be noted that Amazon's info for this DVD version of the film is a bit confusing...  it states in one location that this is a ""Region 1 NTSC"" pressing but in other places that it is a European PAL coded version.  In FACT it IS a Region 2 PAL release and a 'region free' player would be required to play it! Regardless - this is a really great and fun filled film with a timeless artfulness that may be enjoyed by young and old alike.  The quality of the DVD transfer is excellent and the disk includes some interesting 'background' extras on Zeman's life and work.  Totally recommended for animation and fantasy fans!",1395792000,6,2701,4.918502202643172
