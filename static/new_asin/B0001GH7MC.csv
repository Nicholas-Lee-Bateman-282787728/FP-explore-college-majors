1998199,3,B0001GH7MC,"This 1964 classic also known as ""Monstrosity"" starts out with ""out of tune"" horny or brassy type music. And the music keeps up until the end. There is some dialog but mostly it is a Bradford Dillman narration. On the plus side they show the pictures of the people with names attached so you get to know the actors. Bradford has made TV appearances well into the 1990's.
------------
Mr. Hetty March (Marjorie Eaton) a rich uggy old lady has plenty of money. With the help of a rogue scientist, Dr. Otto frank (Frank Grestle) kept on retainer, she intends to have her brain (through the miracle of modern 1964 atomics), transferred into a young body. The body is to be selected from three candidates. Which one will it be? Anita from Spain, Nina from Austria, or Bea from England?
What does her aged companion think of this? Will the scientist be able to gain something from this? And do you thing the three donors suspect what awaits them?

Do not get distracted by the naked female bodies with strategically placed metal straps.",1337904000,,1029,4.622950819672131
1998200,2,B0001GH7MC,"HERE THERE WOULD BE SPOILERS IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY SPOIL THIS FILM

The alternate title of this bizarre and disturbing 1964 film is MONSTROSITY and after about 45 seconds you know why. A decrepit and cronelike multimillionairess, Mrs. Hetty March, is funding experiments in brain transplantation by Dr. Otto Frank (Sieg Heil when you say that!), who uses the corpses of beautiful young girls as research material in his odd form of nuclear medicine. Mrs. March is hoping that Dr. Frank can transplant her miserable old brain into the body of a lovely young woman.

As THE ATOMIC BRAIN opens, Dr. Frank, who has been out robbing graves a la Dr. Frankenstein, has managed to transplant a dog's brain into a man and create a buxom zombie girl who wanders around creepily in her sheer burial shroud. He moves on to the final stage of his experiment when Mrs. March hires three pretty domestics, dark-eyed and olive-skinned Anita from Spain, pretty blonde Nina from Austria, and Bea The Bombshell from Great Britain as potential transplant recipients.

Mrs. March grabs a grope here and there, practically drooling as she has the girls model sexy clothes and lingerie for her. Anita is quickly found to be of inferior quality (she has a large winestain birthmark), and so she is given to Dr. Frank for further experimentation. He transplants his cat's brain into her. Anita, in what is arguably the best role in the film, spends the rest of the movie chasing and eating rodents, climbing the eaves of the March mansion, yowling, hissing, and scratching people.

The vain, silly, but voluptuous Bea with her comes-and-goes faux Cockney accent is Mrs. March's first choice for a new body; built along the 1950s Sex Goddess lines of Jayne Mansfield, she ""has the same measurements as Marilyn Monroe."" Although she tries to befriend her two compatriots, it's evident she's really enjoying her special status, and so she lets Nina scrub the toilets and polish the silver without objection. Bea is given the best of everything, at least until Anita the cat girl tears her eye out, rendering her useless to Mrs. March (and to herself, as it soon becomes apparent).

And so, the pretty Nina becomes Mrs. March's intended victim. Nina tries to give Mrs. March her two weeks' notice and is ignored. Nina makes escape plans. The now one-eyed Bea refuses to go with her. ""I'd rather die,"" she sobs.

What's so very odd is that nobody in the house is making a great secret of Dr. Frank's unusual talents or Mrs. March's twisted plans. The girls actually observe a number of weird and terrifying things, like Hans the dog man barking at the end of his chain. Despite all this, they don't panic and scream. In fact they seem to have an amazingly difficult time finally figuring out that they have to run away as fast and as far as possible. Which is okay in a sense, because the pretty girls who make up the cast are the only redeeming elements in this movie (I remember liking this Creature Feature when I was a kid, although a recent viewing just confirmed that it was all due to my emerging heterosexuality). But still, Nina and Bea and poor Anita are so dense you have to wonder if they NEED new brains.

Still, it turns out that Nina is smarter than Mrs. March and Company and manages to run off the set. I don't know if the actress, Erica Peters, aka Erika Knab, ever acted again. The movie's O. Henry ending comes when the---well, not the GOOD---doctor puts Mrs. March's brain into his cat's corpse. How he shoehorned a human brain into a cat's head is never explained, though a quick glimpse of the old lady's brains reveals something appropriately slimy and small in Dr. Frank's gloved hands.

With a compound surrounded by an electrified fence and barbed wire, a mad scientist named Otto, a lycanthrope named Hans, and an Austrian lead character named Nina, THE ATOMIC BRAIN has a distinctly unnerving 3/4 Teutonic goose-step beat to it. The Auschwitz Barrack IV Human Experiment elements in this film are really quite sickening, and after not having seen this film since about 1974, I can honestly admit I could miss it again for another 37 years without losing any sleep.

The distinguished actor Bradford Dillman narrates the action throughout the film. His stentorian voice adds a perfect element of quirkiness to THE ATOMIC BRAIN. The film stock quality was poor, though the morbidly gothic atmosphere of Mrs. March's house is carried off with all the elan of a funeral parlor at midnight on Halloween. The background music will creep your very flesh. Far from good, though not entirely awful, THE ATOMIC BRAIN never rises (or falls) to the level of a typical One-and-a-Half-Star Five Star Classic. All in all, this MONSTROSITY is worth seeing once in a very great while as a curiosity.",1305504000,,4781,4.771463119709795
1998201,1,B0001GH7MC,"Not likely to attain cult classic status, ""The Atomic Brain"" concerns a rich old woman, Mrs. March (Marjorie Eaton), who is funding researcher Dr. Otto Frank (Frank Fowler) to discover a way to transplant her brain into a younger woman's body. Otto has a small nuclear reactor in the basement of Mrs. March's house. The laboratory set looks even cheaper than similar stuff on the original ""Outer Limits"" television show.

The scientific basis behind Otto's experiments and the need to radiate his subjects is never adequately explained, obviously they needed the reactor to justify the original ""Atomic Brain"" title, the word fission is unconvincingly thrown around several times. I can only assume that the alternate title, ""The Monstrosity"",  is someone's comment on the quality of the film. At the start of the movie Otto's success has been limited to the transplant of a dog's brain into a man (who has large teeth and looks a bit like the goon in one of shorts featuring ""The Three Stooges"").

Mrs. March is encouraged when the doctor steals a woman's corpse from the graveyard and reanimates it to zombie status. Needing fresh living bodies for her transplant she hires three attractive young girls from Europe serve as housekeepers. Mrs. March has no other staff at her mansion, only a wimpy ""companion and gigolo"" guy who is turned on by the young girls. His name is Victor and the narrator sums up his motivation with the movie's best lines: ""Three new bodies. Fresh, live, young bodies. No families or friends within thousands of miles, no one to ask embarrassing questions when they disappear. Victor wondered which one Mrs. March would pick. The little Mexican, the girl from Vienna, or the buxom blond? Victor knew his pick, but he still felt uneasy, making love to an 80 year old woman in the body of a 20 year old girl; it's insanity!""

Despite the low budget and feeble scripting, the movie is not entirely awful. Eaton (who played the fortune teller in cult classic ""Night Tide"") is wonderfully evil and nasty. Fowler (a veteran of countless golden age television classics) is amusing as your basic mad scientist, and the house itself is appropriately sinister. In fact, when the girls first arrive I thought that it might actually turn into a decent film as things get very spooky and suspenseful. Unfortunately the three actresses (none of whom did any subsequent film work) are not up to even modest acting challenges and things pretty much fall apart until a nice twist at the end (which would have worked much better if they had not spoiled it with a second twist). Despite the frequent use of a narrator to explain much of the story, so much happens off camera that is never explained that it is likely there was a much longer original version that was extensively trimmed to get to the present 72 minute running length. This much slash and burn editing does have the benefit of requiring viewers to exercise their own atomic brains whenever a narrative gap occurs. But the story follows the genre's formula so closely that it is not too difficult to fill in the blanks each time this occurs.

Only fans of bad 50's-60's science fiction are likely to ever actually watch ""The Atomic Brain"" and they should find it fairly representative of this genre. At least the premise is decent, with a significantly bigger budget for sets and competent supporting cast members it could have been an entertaining movie.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1138406400,3,3476,4.814070351758794
1998202,3,B0001GH7MC,"This 1964 horror film is so bad it is almost funny in points.  The plot is generally incoherent and the science in the science fiction is generally non-existent.  In spite of all the negatives, this movie does have some redeeming characteristics.

We are introduced to mad scientist Dr. Otto Frank (Frank, Frankenstein; could there possibly be a connection here?) early in the movie, wandering around cemeteries looking for freshly dead bodies for his nefarious experiments.  By coincidence, veteran actor Frank Gerstle played Dr. Frank.  To be Frank...oh, never mind.  Anyway, Dr. Frank is transplanting the brains of various critters into the bodies.  He is funded by wealthy Hetty March (Marjorie Eaton; later Eaton and Gerstle played bit parts in the Steve McQueen film ""Bullitt""), who wants Dr. Frank to learn how to place her brain into a young body so that she may live on.  Dr. Frank has succeeded a couple of times, so there is a vicious creature wandering around the grounds of Hetty March's isolated mansion that has the brain of a dog and a beautiful young girl also wandering around with the brain of a cat.

Victor, who I think was March's boyfriend and is played by Frank Fowler, picks up three young women at the airport and brings them to the mansion, supposedly to be servants.  March quickly chooses which body she wants.  The pace really picks up after that (yawn).  We see various scenes of the doctor's laboratory in the basement, which includes a couple of young women covered only by metal bands.  There are other similarly titillating scenes in various places that I suppose were originally there to gain a young male audience.  We also see bubbling liquids and inferences that the doctor is working with radioactive materials (oh my!).  The movie never explains the relationship between the radioactivity and the brain transplants, but it all sounds very scientific.

Periodically the movie intersperses all the tension with a murder or other death, and the occasional brain transplant to remind you that this is a science fiction movie.  Eventually we get to the exciting conclusion where mostly everyone dies, and there is the chilling, totally unexpected ending (yawn again).

Okay, this movie is pretty bad.  Yet, it does have some redeeming value.  Forty plus years down the road the movie is more humorous than scary, and the supposedly tense scenes are so bad that you want to laugh and then smack the actor or actress being murdered or dying for being so stupid.  Perhaps intelligence was lower in those days.  Certainly it was underutilized.

This movie was so good, or bad, or whatever, that it was lampooned in the fifth season of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  It might be worth watching this version and then watching that version to see how your jokes compare with those of the MST3K crew.

Worthy of note is that the narrator is none other than Bradford Dillman in an uncredited role.  Dillman was later a big star in movies and television in the 70s and early 80s.

This movie appears to have several titles.  I have seen it called ""Atomic Brain,"" ""Monstrosity:  The Atomic Brain,"" and ""Monstrosity.""  The titles may be different, but the movie is identically campy in each case.",1136851200,,3221,4.88929889298893
1998203,2,B0001GH7MC,"Let's not beat around the bush here: The Atomic Brain just isn't any good.  From the title, you might expect to see some sort of interesting, even intense, science fiction thriller; what you get in reality is a snooze fest that you're only too happy to forget once it's over.  As far as the atomic stuff goes, all we learn is that some type of atomic rigamarole goes into the unsanctioned scientific experiments of Dr. Frank (a body-stealing doctor named Dr. Frank - brilliant!).  Forget about the brains, as well, because we don't get to see a single brain anywhere (nor can I detect any brains whatsoever among the entire cast and crew).

This film is all about a grouchy old lady who wants to recapture her youth - actually, she wants to capture a second youth in the body of a stacked young woman.  We all would like to avoid getting old and dying, but Ms. March (Marjorie Eaton) has something most of us don't have - a mad scientist in the basement perfecting the science of brain transplantation.  Naturally, you don't just start out transplanting human brains, though; Dr. Frank's little menagerie of walking weirdoes counts among them a man with a dog's brain, a woman with a cat's brain, and a woman who walks around with no brain at all.  Oddly enough, the woman without a brain is actually smarter than everyone else in this movie - she, unlike our trio of poor dumb victims, actually tries to leave the house and grounds at some point.  The three foreign housekeepers Ms. March hires never even try to escape, despite the fact that they are pretty much on their own most of the time, know they are in danger, and have only a decrepit old woman and an aging lackey of a fellow standing between them and freedom.  Don't give me any excuses about the ""animal man"" lurking out in the yard, either, because these gals watch the creature get chained up and still don't have the gumption to make a run for it.

Yes, it's the weirdest beauty contest of them all, as Ms. March ogles and feels up her nubile young charges looking for the perfect new body for her sick little brain.  Miss England wows the audience and judge with a completely ridiculous accent (which seems to come and go quite a bit) and a hip-swaying walking style that only young, healthy hips can hope to survive.  Should she, however, be unable to fulfill her duties for any reason (such as having her eye raked out by a fellow contestant who now thinks she is a cat, for example), the plainer yet passably attractive runner-up will be expected to take her place.

There's a bit of a twist at the end, but honestly, who really cares?  Never before has the act of playing God been such a complete waste of time.  Watching Ms. March shuffle down the stairs is pretty much the highlight of this boring film that promises little and delivers even less.",1114128000,2,2821,4.514734774066798
1998204,2,B0001GH7MC,"This early 1960s black and white ""horror"" film is a prime example of the misunderstood evil genius-reanimated zombie genre typical of the era. The distinguishing features of this film are the extremely disagreeable spinster and the outlandishly bad acting, particularly of the three female victims. (I am especially fond of their skillfully crafted foreign accents.)

This one has it all: ornery old woman, evil genius, hokey pseudo-scientific sets and dialogue, wooden acting, and a cat brain transplanted into a nubile young girl. The one unifying theme of the film, however, is that of boredom. The film isn't one of the very worst ever made, but it ranks right up there on the all time boringness scale. I recommend that if you want to watch this film you buy the version featuring the MST3K guys and their trademark mockery: it relieves the boredom and makes the viewing experience infinitely more enjoyable!",1106611200,,913,5.086666666666667

As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc released by St. Clair Vision. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 1, Side B, third feature - THE ATOMIC BRAIN (aka MONSTROSITY), starring Marjorie Eaton, Frank Gerstle, and Xerxes the cat.  Directed by Joseph Mascelli.

Objectively, I have to admit that THE ATOMIC BRAIN is a pretty terrible film.  There really isn't any rational way to defend it - there probably wasn't even a rational excuse for making it, other than hoping to make a quick buck off the drive-in crowd.  Still, I don't think it's as bad as some have made out.  It's premise isn't even that ridiculous - a scientist, Gerstle, has been experimenting with transplanting a human brain; and Marjorie Easton, as the wealthy dowager Hetty March, is funding his research so she will have the opportunity to live forever by slipping her brain into a fresh, nubile body whenever the old one begins to wear out.

There's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip, as they say, and despite a reasonable idea for a science-fiction/horror hybrid, the result onscreen is less than what it could have been.  Several of the doctors previous experiments - fresh bodies from the morgue with transplanted brains from animals - are rejuvenated and are roaming around the grounds, while in the meantime, three likely candidates for Mrs. March's new body are brought out to her isolated mansion, believing they are going to be the new housemaids.  Soon enough they discover the fate that lies in store for them, but will it be in time to keep the evil doctor from transplanting the old woman's brain into the body of her choice?

Yeah, well, I'm on the edge of my seat.  IMDb lists this movie in their bottom 100 flicks, but I'd take that with a grain of salt.  I can think of at least three movies right of the top of my head that belong on that list that aren't on it (ASTRO-ZOMBIES, THE EXECUTIONER PART II, THE GIANT CLAW) - all of which are worse than this one.  Besides, there's this kind of deviant psychosexual undercurrent to this film that's fairly interesting in and of itself, though it isn't blatant or pornographic by any means.  It's full of those rather subtle images that directors used to stuff into films when they couldn't show anything more graphic - lots of women in undergarments, women kneeling at men's feet, women in bondage - so on and so forth.  All of these images are technically free of any sexual meaning, but by the time the end of the film was unspooling, I had a definite feeling there was a concerted effort to portray more than the superficial image in the film reel.  Don't make more of it than it is - this film is still not good by any means, but I've seen worse.  And I'll probably see many more that are worse as well.",1393027200,2,3134,4.82803738317757
