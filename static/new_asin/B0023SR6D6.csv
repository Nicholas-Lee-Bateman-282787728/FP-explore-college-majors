8349972,5,B0023SR6D6,"Highly recommended. Film is in Dutch, with English subtitles. No region coding, but you need a PAL player. This is said to be the only feature-length, fiction film focused on the teachings of nonduality (Advaita). If you are a student of Advaita, this is a must-see. There is a very active nonduality studies community in the Netherlands and this film reflects this high degree of interest.",1264636800,4,390,4.924242424242424
