1919550,5,B0000CGECF,"I bought a copy  at the consumer electronics show last week, and am impressed at the quality and information of this disc. It was informative, easy to follow, and my picture is much better now on my Toshiba TV. I have not tried  the audio tones yet, but the disc has a chapter for using a sound-level meter.  My wife actually watched the entire disc with me -unusual for her.  Very cool.",1011225600,21,387,4.333333333333333

1919566,5,B0000CGECF,"I put off tuning my system because I thought it would be too technical. But this DVD made it easy, even sort of fun.",1386892800,,116,3.875
1919567,5,B0000CGECF,"Good help to set up speakers and equipment.
The TV patterns to set up the TV right is nice features of the disk.
The shipping on the disk was quick, well packaged also.",1381017600,,168,4.121212121212121
1919568,1,B0000CGECF,Don't buy this!  You already know everything they are trying to tell you.  It is a total waste of money and your time for watching it.,1372032000,,134,4.115384615384615
1919569,3,B0000CGECF,"Though I bought this by accident, I'm glad I did. The tests are fairly comprehensive and useful, and my home theater sounds better because of it.",1364515200,,145,4.615384615384615
1919570,2,B0000CGECF,"Edited to remove a star.  I still was not happy with the picture, and just started messing around with adjustments.  Got a better picture all by myself, and it did not cost a dime.

Following the instructions only took a couple of minutes.  (I didn't even look at the intro video - just the instructions for the individual adjustments.) As others have said, be sure the one you buy has the blue filter, as two adjustments can't be made without it.

Pretty dated - their idea of top-of-the-line connections is S-video and component.

I think I still have a bit of a green overload, which is why I bought this CD in the first place.  It did not have me touch any of the individual RGB adjustments, which I was expecting.  It does mention ""red push,"" and has a sort of a test pattern for that, but my problem is green push......

Still, I think it did improve the picture somewhat.",1363305600,,878,4.403726708074534
1919571,2,B0000CGECF,"This DVD home theater tune up was too old.  This was before blu ray players and hdmi inputs, and Lcd tv's.  It does have a sound test to check your speakers, and that is the primary reason I bought it.  The ""actors"" tried to be funny and put on skits.  That made it worse.  If you are looking for a how to video just check out youtube and search home theater setup.  If you are only looking for a 5.1 speaker channel test, then this will work for you.",1355097600,2,451,4.01123595505618
1919572,5,B0000CGECF,"I had my copy for many years & had adjusted many sets with it.  Now I don't know what happened to it, but I'm buying another copy.

It has very clear directions for the most part, & the best is the video section.  My old 36""crt set has looked great for now 8 years.  When adjusted properly, your set will last much much longer since it's no longer being over-driven in contrast & brightness.  One of the common mistakes made is to ramp up the sharpness level.  All this achieves is more video noise...when adjusted with the guides you'll see a vast improvement.

New receivers now have what's called Audessy sound adjustment, which is a far cry better than the old system.  Once you enter your distances from speaker locations to where you would sit, no longer do you adjust to ""White Noise""...(you no longer need to buy the sound meter from Radio Shack) the system is computer controlled & puts out a complete frequency ""pulse"" through each speaker several times, (if you have different listening positions you do it as many times as you have positions) then the onboard computer figures out all the parameters & adjusts them accordingly.  Not only the level, but it applies a equalizer to the whole system & adjusts each speaker.  My system, as good as it was benefited a smoother, more natural result.

So, to wrap up; the video section is great, the audio section is only for those who have older systems where you do all the adjusting.",1270944000,,1440,4.5859375
1919573,5,B0000CGECF,easy to understand and apply information - as a result of using this I found out I had my rear surround speakers connected incorrectly.  I have been able to balance the sound from all six speakers to a much more satisfying level.,1241913600,,229,4.4523809523809526
1919574,5,B0000CGECF,"I purchased this DVD once for myself and a second time as a gift to a friend.  I used it mainly to adjust the video parameters of my sets.  The instructions are simple yet effective with easy-to-understand demonstrations.  Once you understand the demonstrations and instructions you will not need to refer to them again, unless you forget them.  The menu is also conveniently structured so that you can refer to the instructions and demos then make your adjustments by choosing the corresponding menu options once the instructions are finished.

There are a few topics that are missing (minor).  One is coverage on scan velocity modulation.  On some sets this is a switchable feature that should be turned off to defeat a set's artificial edge sharpening circuitry.  If it is possible to switch this feature off it may actually make the Sharpness/Detail adjustment easier to make by reducing any chance of ghost images on the contours of objects.

Other users may also notice that there is no coverage on the advantages of component or HDMI video connections nor any coverage on upscaling or de-interlacing signals for modern flat panel TVs.  This is due to the age of the DVD.  To obtain this information, you'd have to obtain a newer calibration DVD.  But this is just a minor inconvenience.

All in all, a great buy.  I can't complain.",1231286400,4,1338,4.8628318584070795
1919575,2,B0000CGECF,Comes with blue filter glasses and a few better than average video patterns. But not much better than any DVD with THX Optimizer. My receiver has its own test tones so those were fairly useless to me.,1215561600,,200,4.4324324324324325
1919576,2,B0000CGECF,Product did not contain everything needed.  I would not recommend it to a friend.,1209686400,,81,4.785714285714286
1919577,4,B0000CGECF,"While I like good video, I am not going to call myself a videophile. Heck, I bought a refurbished 32"" Vizio. And while I loved having a HDTV, I was not overjoyed by the Vizio's picture. I figured, for $20, I had nothing to lose.

First, using this disc only for video setup was easy. One thing I found, was my tv did not necessarily respond as the instructions stated. Also, the Vizio has several settings beyond ""Custom"". So after going through the video setup, I was not sure it had helped. I then tried some of the other settings after making the initial changes, such as ""movie"" and ""game"", and found one that made the adjustments look great, even at 480i. Definitely worth it if all you want to do is adjust your picture. If you are going to spend hundreds, if not thousands on a tv, for less than a couple of dvds, you can realize the potential of your purchase. Hey Vizio, spring for one of these with your tv's and I bet you'll have a lot fewer returns!!!",1196035200,8,963,4.291208791208791
1919578,4,B0000CGECF,"I basically was looking for something just to adjust the picture of my plasma television.  This was relatively easy to do using this product.  Instructions are easy to follow, and I was able to calibrate my picture in just a few minutes.",1186358400,7,237,4.619047619047619
1919579,4,B0000CGECF,"I debated this one for $18 (sealed new) from an Amazon seller or the Ovia one which was $40.

I just purchased an HD LCD TV and some of the content inside this DVD is outdated and has no mentionings on how to adjust an LCD backlight and some other features like Dynamic Contrast, etc.

However, the basic calibrations like Contrast, Sharnpess, Color, Tint, Brightness, etc, are great and get the job done.

The audio tests are nothing more than ""Let me send a signal to each speaker so you know which one is left, right, rear, or center, or sub""

It was good for speaker polarity, but I would like to have seen an equalizer test for knowing how to best set mids and highs and filtering out lows - but for testing surround sound - yes it works.

For the money, yes, I recommend this, I wouldn't buy the DVD used since it may not have the blue clear filter lens that is included to help you adjust color and tint.  Mine was factory sealed, though it was from a seller.

I will continue to use this DVD at other places through out the house and I'm sure friends will want to borrow it.  I also pre-called Blockbuster to see if they rented one out, but they don't - and also I ""hear"" that Circuit City and Best Buy may give out free ones, but I didn't get my tv from them and didn't know anyone that worked there.  I plan to upgrade my audio system and this will come in handy again.

This one's a nice keeper since most tv retain different video settings for the various inputs, so IF I add a HDDVD player or upconvert, I can use this DVD again.",1184457600,10,1542,4.179054054054054
1919580,5,B0000CGECF,"A must have for any HDTV set up. Most TVs are sent by the manufacturers with the color settings and brightness way oversaturated. They want them to look bright if set up in stores for display.

For even an amatuer, this simple DVD will lead you through the steps to adjust all of the settings to get accurate color from your set. No more ""blooming"" reds or unnatural skintones.",1169078400,8,377,4.463768115942029

1919592,3,B0000CGECF,"I hoped with this product and the suggested sound meter, I could tune my system with a graphic equalizer.  I thought this would provide a tone at 1khz, 10khz etc. so I could flatten out the response curve.  It's just a simple product with no such features.",1159401600,,256,4.425531914893617
1919593,5,B0000CGECF,"I literally was goinig to get rid of a 27"" TV until I calibrated it with this disc.  It now has one of the best pictures of any tube type TV I have ever seen. It also did wonders for my crt rear projection as well.",1134086400,8,214,3.652173913043478
1919594,2,B0000CGECF,"Guys, this is basically the same as the Avia Guide, but supposedly with more of a beginner's tilt.  Otherwise it's the same material.  I have the Avia disc and I'm very disappointed by its out-of-dateness and very poor navigation, plus most of the video tests are useless, and the tests don't tell you how to fix things.  I do not recommend either the Avia Guide or its cousin Sound & Vision Tune-Up guide.",1100217600,24,406,4.534246575342466
1919595,4,B0000CGECF,"I considered getting Avia Home Theather but decided it wasn't worth 40+ dollars.  If you are not a serious video/audiophile, this product does a great job.  It's simple to use at the right price.
The two presenters can get a bit annoying yet they can be amusing at the same time.  I spent around 45-60 minutes to set all the basic parameters on our projection TV and sound system.",1044662400,21,380,4.478260869565218
1919596,4,B0000CGECF,"This DVD is a must for all people interested in audio and video quality. Also it's simple, and the narrators are very cute. It gives a basic description of new digital home theatre systems, including the receiver, the speakers, different types of connections, and useful tests of audio and video calibration.
One of the most difficult items on calibration is that of the subwoofer. The test included is perfect, and at last I can enjoy hearing the deep bass without distortion. Different digital sound tests are included like Dolby 5.1 and DTS, which make this DVD a reference guide to the new era of digital home theatre systems.",1038355200,37,630,4.842592592592593
1919597,4,B0000CGECF,"I have both Sound & Vision Home Theater Tune-Up and the Avia Guide To Home Theater.  If you're a serious video/audiophile, you will want to get the Avia Guide To Home Theater which has far more comprehensive video/audio calibration tests and procedures.
Then again, I suspect the S&V disc is more aimed at the 'mass market' and as such, it does an excellent job.  The explanations are very well (and occasionally humorously) explained by two highly appealing presenters.  The audio/video tune-ups are a subset of what's available on the Avia Guide disc, though the S&V disc also includes some test patterns from Avia Pro which I hadn't seen before.
I very much like the 'Extras' section of the disc which has some great demo clips from Dolby, DTS, and THX.  These are not available on Avia Guide to Home Theater.  Also, the DTS tune-up is not available on the Avia Guide, and is most welcome though it didn't result in any changes to my audio settings.
I experienced a strange glitch with the video on the speaker balance tune-up - the wrong speaker was highlighted or the previous menu would be displayed.  Weird.  I have had no problems with the Avia Guide.
Overall, at the MSRP ...I highly recommend the Sound & Vision Home Theater Tune-Up.  It's informative and entertaining, and I think it will help novice users better understand and make the most of their home theaters.",1018483200,141,1377,4.756302521008403
1919598,4,B0000CGECF,"I'm glad to see a set-up disc that doesn't cost [so much].  I have not seen the much talked about Avia disc, but my guesses are that for most people with a basic 4:3 TV and economically packaged surround system, this is all that you need and perhaps more.  The on-screen narrators provide an easy-to-understand introduction for the beginner and the seperately accessible tests make it easy for the more experienced to jump right in at his own pace.  I'm also glad to finally see DTS audio tests along with the Dolby Digital tests.  Also helpful is the explanation of how to use RadioShack's sound meter although the disc's instructions to point the microphone up differed with the meter's instructions  to point the meter at each sound source (Anybody know which way is really best?).  This disc also includes a nice variety of demos to show off your system's full video and surround potential.",1016755200,42,894,4.7727272727272725
1919599,3,B0000CGECF,"I liked the DVD.  It is very easy to opperate and search for test patterns and signals.  I am an audiophile or audio expert, so for me the disk was somewhat elementary.  For beginers to intermediates this is a great adition to any home theater.  I would have really apreciated if they would have had an audio break-in signal, which basically losses up the drivers in a new pair of speakers.  That was really the only dissipointment for me.",1015459200,8,439,4.506329113924051
