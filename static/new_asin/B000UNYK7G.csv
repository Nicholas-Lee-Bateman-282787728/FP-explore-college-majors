8213958,5,B000UNYK7G,"All music has been done over and over again - and we still can't get enough of him and his fabulous orchestra.  Wish they would turn the cameras off the audience...when the various concerts are put together in ""hash"" form, the audience gives away the idea that it's a new performance.  And some of the camera shots are boring....either too many 'crying' scenes, or too many shots of the cute girls that the cameraman sees ( not that his taste is so bad ) but I bought the DVD for the music NOT the audience participation scenes.",1387929600,,528,4.43298969072165
8213959,2,B000UNYK7G,"I have multi Andre Rieu DVD's and had expected this one to be just as great, but it was not. This DVD plucks bits from previous DVD's, copies them onto this one and with that routine; dimmness, blurry immages, and the introduction to each presentation from Andre himself are skipped.
He himself brings laughter, humor, and appreciation to the people who wrote these classic songs.
Anyway, I will not load this one into my DVD player again. I am donating this one to a nursing home due only to the fact that they have not seen the superior ones that I have.
I do take my DVD's of music to nursing homes, no one forgets music!",1305676800,,624,4.387931034482759
8213960,5,B000UNYK7G,"I am a total fan of Andre Rieu and, have wished for some time that there was a DVD that had favorite parts from more than one concert.  Well this is it!  The most important thing I can say about Best of Live is that it is a compilation of  THE BEST. I highly recommend this one.",1274832000,3,278,3.8421052631578947
