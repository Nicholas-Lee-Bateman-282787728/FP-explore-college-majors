Plato, Aristotle, Ceasar ideas and writing, even if they did not exist, there messages on thought and reasoning have been transferred to present day and are important towards the evolution of the ideas, and opinions of philosophy and history. There work, is significant, and IS NOT taken as the word of the ""LORD"" to be taken and ""HOLY"" and never criticized! Connecting certain archeological figures in the earth, does not mean the events written about those individuals actually happened or were documented accurately. Finding a a tomb/ossuary says nothing to the seemingly impossible act of ressurrection from death! What about the immorality of the entire content of the bible(especially the Old Testament), in which you must believe if  you have Christian faith. The old testament taken literally is possibly the most immoral document ever written (if you want to claim it's accuracy then go ahead, it makes the actions under the word of the omnipotent deity just plain capricious!) Morals were innately born within us before climbing to the top of Mt. Sinai, or do you really believe that one thought that killing thy neighbor, or other immoral actions where ok until they heard through Moses from ""GOD"" himself.

And in that review, I think the points on both sides were well taken. I give this ""movie"" five stars for just that.

6015372,2,B00FN0D4O6,"The premise of this movie is good - that it makes sense to fairly asses the reliability of the Bible, from a historical perspective, using a courtroom-like trial. The reality of this production is much different - it's interesting, but as an assessment of how Christians who don't actually want to allow a real debate of the topic think. So, the presenters act as if they are the defense attorneys, protecting the reputation and reliability of the bible. Okay, seems like a good idea, but, one kind of important detail would be to actually include the prosecutor. All of the 'prosecutor's' viewpoints are presented in the words of the defense attorney. I.e. there's no actual prosecutor or opposing view presented. There's no opportunity to call witnesses and have them examined and cross examined. There's no actual honest discussion or debate - only the pro-Bible view is portrayed. Ultimately, I turned it off partway through because it actually came across as more of a sales pitch, which goes something like this: (in the worlds of Stephen Colbert) ""The Bible's true and I know the Bible's true because the Bible says the Bible's true and that's how I know the Bible's true.""

6015385,3,B00FN0D4O6,"I am a Christian in Mormon Studies who was considering this as a recommended resource for my support group for Ex-Mormon Christians. I know that there is strong evidence for the support of the reliability of the Bible however it tends to be fragmented and scattered requiring a cohesive and cogent presentation. I was hoping that this would it be it.

It's not.

While some of the best evidence in support of the Bible can be found here, it's presented in such a biased and manipulative manner here as to reduce this production to the same level as the partisan and agenda driven Book of Mormon propaganda pieces produced by Mormon Apologists. It's embarrassing.

Case in point: The narrator states that only the reliability of the four Gospels will be considered in this ""Case"". However, the majority of evidence that's presented addresses the reliability of the Old Testament rather than the new. For example, the Dead Sea Scrolls are presented as evidence for the integrity of the text transmission process of the ENTIRE Bible.

Problem: The way that the Old and New Testament manuscripts were transmitted are two entirely differently things. The Jews were concerned about text transmission down to the letter level. Therefore, Old Testament manuscript transmission it was a slow, tedious, tightly controlled process. This produced only a few surviving, but highly accurate, manuscripts (around a thousand not counting isolated small fragments).

The Early Christians, on the other hand were trying to get ""the message"" out as quickly as possible and manuscript production was wild and uncontrolled. The result was a flood of manuscripts that vary greatly in regard to the quality and precise of the text - around 5,800 original language manuscripts at last count, even more if you add in second language manuscripts. Yes, God's word was in the preserved (via the preponderance of manuscripts to use for comparison) but in an entirely DIFFERENT way than the viewer is lead to believe in this documentary.

Further, and in similar fashion, archaeological evidence for Old Testament people and places are presented in this film in support of the reliability of the New Testament. This is absurd beyond words! In an academic setting this is known as bad scholarship; In a rhetorical setting this is known as fallacious argumentation, and; In a legal setting this is known as an ""irrelevancy"". It's like arguing that archaeological digs in Rome are valid evidence for the existence of the Clovis aboriginals in the Southwest United States.

Friends, I SO wanted this documentary to be good! And in the end it was just awful - well deserving of the multiple 1 and 2 star reviews I'm seeing here. I have been generous and it given it 3-Stars simply because its DOES manage to present some of the best evidence for the reliability of the Bible in a well produced but, as stated previously, flawed, manipulative, and fallacious fashion. Stated simply, the producers should be ashamed of themselves for producing propaganda rather than a real documentary.

Sadly, I can't recommend this film and, in fact, recommend that you avoid it because it's more cynicism than faith producing. Instead, I would steer the reader to the following resources where they stay on target, engage in good scholarship, and don't manipulate:

8617072,4,B00FN0D4O6,"This DVD, ""The Bible on Trial: beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" (Lutheran Hour Ministries 64E38-5/2013), puts forth fairly well, as also does a prior DVD, ""How We Got the Bible"" (Lutheran Hour Ministries 69E24-8/2013), the video contents of which repeat at some points, a convincing case for how Bible-believing Protestants regard the Holy Bible. The discussions of the issues are quite brief, but, then, they are meant, firstly and primarily, to stimulate group study and other discussions of the issues; in such collective settings, the participants surely would go beyond ""the bare bones"" extent in  addressing the questions posed and the issues raised.

Just how specifically Lutheran is the DVD's orientation is not so clear. There is a complete neglect, on both this and the other DVD mentioned above, of the more nuanced attitude of the Lutheran Confessions regarding the Deuterocanonical Writings of the Lutheran O.T. Apocrypha. While it would be inappropriate to dwell long on that matter, one at least could mention that, indeed, specifically and fully Lutheran Bibles include the Apocrypha, certainly to the extent and numbers of those writings which Lutherans regard as normative. It should be pointed out that the sanctity and usefulness of the Apocrypha is something that Lutherans recognise, even if they do not accord full and unconditionally canonical status to those writings.

For its part, in ""How We Got the Bible"", there occurs a grossly exaggerated brief description of the Latin Vulgate Bible's inadequacies compared to the Scriptures in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts from which the Vulgate, varioiusly, was translated. The alert viewer might wonder why Wycliffe's translation into English is so important if its Latin base was so corrupt as the speaker at that point accuses it so carelessly of being, not to mention that Luther and other Reformers continued to use the Vulgate Bible (normalised eventually in the Sixtine and, even better, the Clementine texts of it) as well as used the more ancient Hebrew/Greek texts of the Biblical writings and the vernacular translations therefrom.

To present some issues more fully, the DVD of the two here under review, and the other one as well, could have offered bonus features going into more detail. For example, there is more pagan and Jewish attestation to the historicity of Jesus' existence, life, claims, and work that one such potential bonus feature. among the others, could detail. For the main discussion, it probably is right to single out the best Roman and Jewish sources, those attested by all, but the speaker should have emplasised more that there are numerous other documentary sources of confirmation than the ones honed in upon as examples. To ignore Josephus completely is a gross oversight. His authentication of Jesus' ministry would be useful to mention, even if some extreme sceptics wrongly question those passages in his historical writings.

If one take this DVD as a starting point, it provides an excellent resource for personal or, especially, group study of the Bible's credentials. More could have been made of the opportunity, however, and the document could have been at least a little more specifically Lutheran in approach.",1526428800,,3231,5.22972972972973
8617073,4,B00FN0D4O6,"The premise of the documentary is good. To put the Bible on trial is a bit presumptuous, but the debate has gone on for centuries and what surprises me is that with the return of Israel to it's own land and the many archeological excavations, the number of dissenters continues to climb. Yet, they don't have any troubles unearthing bits and pieces of any other ancient civilization and romanticizing over the different bits of pottery, statues, and stone tablets. Amazing that so many intellectuals can be sharp as tacks with Mayan, Babylonian, and Assyrian ruins, yet  go completely blind and lose all their skills around Sodom, Gomorrah, Kumran, and other ancient ruins in Israel.

What I would like to have seen with this film is a bit more speculation and hypotheses concerning the new testament and why it is accepted that the earliest written versions of the Bible were so much younger than the actual events and what happened to the original written documents since at least two of the four gospels were eyewitness accounts. Some good work and arguments. I would like to see this continue into a series as more evidence is uncovered over time. As for the historical aspect of the Bible and it's record of the history of the Israeli people from before Abraham, it's academic.",1508025600,,1282,4.822727272727272
