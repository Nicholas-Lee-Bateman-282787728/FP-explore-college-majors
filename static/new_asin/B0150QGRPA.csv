8732228,5,B0150QGRPA,"My daughter is bilingual, so we're happy to get this video for some German-language entertainment.  The animation is ok while the art direction is beautiful and unique compared to other content in this realm.  Gustav Klimt-inspired Mia and Me comes to mind.  My daughter was entertained and the writing wasn't insipid and the action wasn't violent.  So, we're happy about the content.  It was well packaged in a box that was slightly larger than the original DVD box to protect it.  So kudos to the German merchant who sold this.",1478995200,,529,4.822222222222222

8732231,2,B0150QGRPA,"There is a gay scene FYI.........just warning those who want to avoid it I figure it is polite.........its in the last season so far with the Dragon Games.....

Also there was a HUGE lacking in their story department many things that could easily be picked apart. For instance they say these are the descendants of the descendants of the original fairytale........well they call Snow white ""THE Snow White"" and they call the Evil Queen so as well as though somehow they were the originals.......but that can't be.......since Ever After HIgh is clearly generations old. There are other instances. So yes the art is cute as can be.....and sometimes you grow to like a character but...the stories are just not as well put together as I would like.",1456099200,,744,4.858267716535433
