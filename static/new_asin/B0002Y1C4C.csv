Rebecca Gayheart (Tv's Dead Like Me, Urban Legend 1 and 2) plays Cassy, Perry's girlfriend who with a band of un infected people, including Kim Cattrall (Tv's Sex and The City, Porkys) and Jon Polito (The Crow, With Friends Like These...) go on a search for an antibody to stop whatever Beau is going to do. Interesting subject by author Robin Cook is sqaushed like a bug on the side of the road with its dreadful acting with wooden performances altough Perry has some good moments. An Invasion with no fun whatsoever. Special effects are dull. Also starring Neal McDonough (Ravenous, Walking Tall, Tv's BoomTown) as Perry's partner in this invasion.",1114128000,,941,4.7439024390243905
