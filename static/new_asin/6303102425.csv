558110,5,6303102425,"""Carmen Jones"" is a great re-interpretation of the famous Bizet opera, Carmen. Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte are WONDERFUL in their respective roles, and the entire cast really puts a new spin on this story. My only complaint is that I wish that Dandridge's own voice had been used in the film. Other than that, this is a great film that classic film lovers should definitely own!",1498694400,,388,4.8059701492537314

558353,5,6303102425,Dorothy Dandrige is a magnificent Carmen and Belafonte in this movie very young shows what a great performer he was to become. A precious item in my collection,1438819200,,159,4.714285714285714
558354,5,6303102425,"Colorful, powerful and innovative movie musical from 1954 that took Bizet's popular opera ""Carmen,"" set it during the middle of World War II in a parachute factory, made the lead male Joe (Harry Belafonte) a G.I. about to go to flying school, and preseved the tunes and orchestrations with fresh new lyrics.  Dorothy Dandridge is simply unbelievable in the title role (one critic described her as the ""only actress who could sizzle by standing still""), and a bright cast including Pearl Bailey and a very young Diahann Carroll round out the fun.  Produced by Oscar Hammerstein and considered quite daring in its day -- holds considerable entertainment value now.  A must for Dandrige fans, and for those who want to explore all facets of Fifties Hollywood musicals.",1437609600,4,765,5.0078740157480315

558542,3,6303102425,"It was groundbreaking when it was first released. Audiences back then were startled when they found themselves watching a bold musical that didn't sound like any musical they had seen before. So in a way, the strangeness of it helped make it a hit, because it was so different. Dorothy Dandridge is sensational, and her and Harry Belafonte make a gorgeous looking, steamy couple, but the working class characters seem to be at odds with the operatic music, despite Hammerstein's attempt to write lyrics that worked with the spoken dialogue. This is not the kind of music these characters would actually sing. So if you haven't seen it before, you might find this odd mix problematic. Belafonte's light singing voice begins his songs but when the dubbed singer takes over, a booming baritone voice comes out that doesn't fit with what we've just heard. The staging of some of the musical numbers is ordinary too. 'Beat Out Dat Rhythm On A Drum' should explode with thrilling choreography, but it doesn't, and 'Stand Up And Fight' just sits there like a second rate opera company. Preminger wasn't a director of musicals, so the dramatic scenes work much better than some of the songs, which is a pity. But Dorothy is just wonderful, so give it a chance. You'll either run for the exits, or accept the premise and be swept away. 'There's a Cafe on The Corner' is great, because it seems to arise out of the action in a natural way. But Dorothy's to die for. She was fabulous.",1420588800,3,1473,4.691119691119691
558543,5,6303102425,Great movie! I watched it for the first time when I was in High School. I hated my music class util she changed to Black Opera. A much watch movie!!,1420416000,,148,3.966666666666667

558547,4,6303102425,Good movie.,1418947200,,11,5.0
558548,5,6303102425,"Carmen Jones is one of my favorite musical movies--Otto Preminger did a fantastic job of bringing it to the screen. No one could have been more exciting in the lead roles as the gorgeous Dorothy Dandridge and her leading man Harry Belafonte.

Belafonte had done some film work before, but was mostly known as a singer and concert artist. Dandridge had done mostly nitery work and a couple of smaller film roles. Together they were dynamite! And then add the talent of Pearl Bailey and a newcomer named Diahann Carroll, who would eventually become another Dandridge type, and it all adds up to a fabulous movie.

The story is an old one--Preminger brought it up to date for the fifties. The music is sensational; the settings are terrific; the acting is top notch!

It is certainly worth having in your collection if you love great music (although Dandridge and Belafonte are dubbed for their singing voices) and great acting! Dandridge won an Oscar nomination as best leading actress and deservedly so. Too bad that the competition for that year was very strong with, among others, Judy Garland and Grace Kelly--who won the coveted statue.

For me it is simply a great movie musical!",1418083200,,1183,4.812807881773399

Love the opera ""Carmen"" by Georges Bizet, and this was a stunning remake.  It was Otto Preminger's ""West Side Story."" Loved the actors, the music, and the remake of it into a modern story that brought an operatic classical piece of music into our lives.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great film to watch. Harry Belafonte is wonderful, and so is Dorothy Dandridge. Pearl Bailey is outstanding.

Dorothy Dandridge, whose vibrant performance earned the first Oscar nomination for an African American actress in a leading role, stars as the beautiful temptress Carmen Jones in this classic musical, produced and directed by Otto Preminger. The seductive Carmen Jones lures the handsome GI Joe [Harry Belafonte] away from his sweetheart Cindy Lou [Olga James], but after she tires of him and takes up with a heavyweight prize-fighter Husky Miller [Joe Adams], she only succeeds in triggering GI Joes tragic revenge.

Upon its release, CARMEN JONES was rightly hailed as a milestone in musical cinema. Boasting an all-black cast, including Pearl Bailey and Diahann Carroll. This critically acclaimed adaption of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen features an iconic soundtrack from Oscar Hammerstein II, including songs such as Beat Out Dat Rhythm on a Drum and was voluptuously shot in Cinemascope and Color by DeLuxe.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: CARMEN JONES [1954] was a rarity for Hollywood: a mainstream film with an all-African American cast. It had been done only a few times before, notably Hallelujah [1929], Cabin in the Sky [1943] and Stormy Weather [1943]. None of these had been a box-office success, so it isn't surprising that director Otto Preminger had so much trouble securing financing to make the film. Just coming off United Artists The Moon Is Blue [1953], Otto Preminger approached United Artists executives Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin with the idea of adapting the stage show Carmen Jones that Billy Rose had done in the 1943 Broadway production, still using the original music from Georges Bizet's opera Carmen but with a new libretto and United Artists didn't think it would be commercially viable. Otto Preminger later wrote, ""I could do anything else I liked for them but not this. I soon discovered that most other companies would not touch it either."" While he was in post-production on the Marilyn Monroe film River of No Return [1954] at Twentieth Century Fox, production head Darryl F. Zanuck asked Otto Preminger to let him read his CARMEN JONES script. Two days later, Darryl F. Zanuck committed 20th Century Fox to the project and secured an $800,000 budget.

As far as an all-black musicals are concerned, 20th Century Fox's 1954 production of CARMEN JONES is a towering achievement and with this adaptation of Georges Bizet's classic opera ""Carmen"" and producer-director Otto Preminger guided actress Dorothy Dandridge to a sizzling, sultry performance that made her the first African-American actor to receive an Academy Award nomination for a leading role. CARMEN JONES is a retelling of Georges Bizet's opera about an independent woman who lives by her own rules and discards men when she grows tired of them. The characters were changed from Europeans to African-Americans on an Army base in the Deep South. Otto Preminger admitted, ""This was really a fantasy, as was Porgy and Bess, the all-black world shown in these films doesn't exist, at least not in the United States and we used the musical-fantasy quality to convey something of the needs and aspirations of colored people.""

Otto Preminger had a huge challenge in making an opera type film and even one that had a successful run on Broadway, appealing to mainly a mainstream audience. Otto Preminger did a great job of making the music and dialogue flow organically into each other and he also did all right in enhancing the story's dramatic tension and gritty settings. At the time, no major studio had attempted an all-black musical since 1943's Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky and yet those films actually hold up even better today, since their scores held some authenticity in drawing from jazz and rhythm & blues.

CARMEN JONES benefits from having a cast of professional black-actors giving their best performances and of course Dorothy Dandridge oozes with charisma as the destructive vixen Carmen Jones, opposite a confident Harry Belafonte as GI Joe, the soldier who gets caught up in Carmen Jones wanton ways. At the start of the film we find ourselves at the North Carolina Army base during World War II, where GI Joe is assigned to deliver hellcat Carmen Jones to the authorities for fighting with a co-worker at the parachute factory where she works. On route, however, Carmen Jones persuades GI Joe to stay at her grandmother's place and she escapes after seducing him. After getting punished, GI Joe eventually catches up with Carmen Jones at a nightclub where she parties with her friends Frankie [Pearl Bailey] and Myrt [Diahann Carroll]. After arrogant boxing champ Husky Miller [Joe Adams] offers to take Carmen Jones and her friends to Chicago, an altercation between Joe and his superior officer forces the couple to hightail it to the Windy City. Joe is now a fugitive in hiding and shackled to a manipulative shrew, but will his true-blue girlfriend, Cindy Lou [Olga James], arrive in time to hopefully set him straight?

Otto Preminger likely had the best intentions in mind for the film CARMEN JONES, but his decision to place the story in an earthy, contemporary milieu makes it an earnest, straightforward but strangely the most adventurous segment here is the opening credits sequence, the first of many times, where Otto Preminger enlisted the help of legendary designer Saul Bass. Carmen Jones is well-crafted and entertaining, yet Otto Preminger's efforts to make it ""real"" sadly had the dubbing of Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte voices, both talented performers who could actually sing, although not in an operatic style. Despite the concessions, it was a huge step forward for African-American visibility and their black culture.

The best reason to revisit CARMEN JONES lies in Dorothy Dandridge's electrifying performance, which saw her, become the first African-American to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. In a series of strikingly coloured outfits, she brings a sensual physicality to the role, and Harry Belafonte too impresses in conveying how the initially level-headed GI Joe becomes morbidly jealous of the proudly defiant Carmen Jones, who refuses to conform to society's expectations of female behaviour. The rich colours, the excellent casting, the boldness of the production all converge to make a compelling, beautiful film in bright 1950s melodrama.

The operatic origins are well respected insofar as the plot goes and you could easily transpose this back to the original opera without much effort. The story of CARMEN JONES plays out here with more sympathy and understanding for the title character than other adaptations I've seen; there is a respect for her freedom here. Carmon Jones leads GI Joe down a dark path, but I did not come away thinking that she was a simple, reductive femme fatale. It broke boundaries by existing, and though it's not perfect, the depiction of a powerful, sexually liberated woman was not typical of the era in the 1950s.

The film CARMEN JONES is actually a really enjoyable and unique wonderful experience. The performers largely overcome the limitations of their simplistic roles, as well as the decent lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein II. For instance, Pearl Bailey gets to perform a very lively number that well showcases her sassy voice, with the song title ""Beat Out Dat Rhythm on a Drum."" Sweet-voiced yet underused Olga James also belts out a fantastic song in which she pleads for GI Joe's safe return. The musical arrangements are beautifully done, and the dubbing is well-performed by vocalists Marilyn Horne and LeVern Hutcherson, both white. To some, especially the critics saying it was a flawed film, but despite the negativity the film was very successful box office hit with the public and enough for Otto Preminger and most of the cast to reunite in 1959 for the George Gershwin adaptation of Porgy and Bess, but although legal entanglements ensued, it has kept that film under lock-and-key for decades.

Otto Preminger did indeed get good performances from his actors and especially from Dorothy Dandridge in particular. When the film was premiered on 5th October, 1954, her portrayal of Carmen Jones made her an overnight sensation with the public and both the black-and-white press. Not only was Dorothy Dandridge the first African-American actress to be ranked among the world's top beauties, but again Dorothy Dandridge was also the first African-American to be nominated as Best Actress by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and deservedly so.

Special Feature: Karen Alexander on CARMEN JONES [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:51] A newly filmed appreciation on CARMEN JONES by curator and lecturer Karen Alexander in a private cinema. Here Curator and Lecturer Karen Alexander gives a good rather spoiler free talk about the film and its take on African-American culture yet how it went against basic stereotypes, the sexuality breaking boundaries, and the importance of Dorothy Dandridges Oscar nomination. Karen Alexander also talks about the all black actors that appeared in the film and feels it stands the test of time, and especially with the help of stars like Pearl Bailey, Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge and for Karen feels the film represents idea around black sexuality, around womens liberation to be and who they wanted to be. Karen also thinks what is great about the film is the multiplicity of the black characters that you actually see in the film, and the making of a black community and black life. Also the black female character actors such as Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll and Dorothy Dandridge is very refreshing to see and observe and what is also refreshing to see that the character of Carmen Jones having a voice to be heard, by her girlfriends, but other people. Karen talks about Harry Belafonte appearance in the film was absolutely fantastic and looked every part a star in the film and especially the character he played. Karen also praises the director Otto Preminger for sending the screenplay to the National Association of the Advancement of Colored People for script approval. Karen says that much as I love the film of CARMEN JONES is that it is interesting to see that Carmen Jones character plays a very loose woman who has a very active sexuality. But despite how far we have progressed, in the range and opportunity of black performers, but with the film CARMEN JONES it really put the mark in the sand especially with Dorothy Dandridge, that paved her way to an Oscar nomination. But if we think where we are now, we cant turn round and say there has been a multiplicity of starring roles of black women playing doctors, scientists and lawyers. But in the end they maybe bit parts, but there are central roles that very rarely goes to black actresses. But to me that is a very academic outlook and I suspect there will be other black women spokesperson who will disagree with her very narrow outlook and should get a life, and also do not be so pedantic.

Audio Commentary by Dr. Adrian Martin: This audio commentary by Australian film and arts critic Dr. Adrian Martin has been newly created for this exclusive Blu-ray UK release. Dr. Adrian Martin admits that he is indeed a fan of the film and is here to give his praising comments but in fact also includes quotes and notes from critics who were not fans of the film to give both sides of the coin. The commentary is packed with great information including differences between the original opera and the film, The Saul Bass credit sequence being the first of many collaborations with Otto Preminger, the affair between Otto Preminger and Dorothy Dandridge, and a lot of background information on the film itself. As we get into the audio commentary Dr. Adrian Martin informs us that in 1992 The National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, selected the film CARMEN JONES for preservation, along with its usual criteria of saying the film is Culturally, Historically or Aesthetically Significant and Dr. Adrian begs the question, which one of these criterias fits the film and especially with a film of this calibre, he would not have a problem in saying that the film fits all the criterias as mentioned and it is important for all of those reasons. Dr. Adams talks about the director Otto Preminger in wanting to make specifically a film that was drama with music, drama with song, and not a conventional Hollywood musical, nor did he want to do a straight opera, because he particularly picked this film project because he had seen the stage production of Carmen Jones in the 1943 Broadway musical that was produced by Billy Rose and of course the words and music was by Oscar Hammerstein II that also had an all-black cast. When we first see Dorothy Dandridge in the canteen, the American film critic Pauline Kael commented that the actress had a performance that she had whiplash hips in a hot pink skirt and Dr. Adrian feels this is quite a good description towards this actress. When CARMEN JONES was first muted and even before filming started, there were massive objections towards the film, especially towards the director Otto Preminger, saying that having an all-black cast was pure fantasy, in a very bad sense, and especially in America in the 1950s period. But Otto Premingers autobiography entitled Kissin the Breeze Goodbye about the film CARMEN JONES, Otto recalls: I had decided to make a dramatic film with music rather than a conventional film musical. Otto Preminger also defended his stance of showing a sort of Utopia society, especially with a positive stance, even thought it was directed by someone who was white. Dr. Adrian talks about the two leading actors being dubbed, especially Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge, because Otto Preminger wanted to move the material much closer to an operetta aria in its musical style and much closer to Georges Bizet opera Carmen, than to Oscar Hammerstein II Carmen Jones stage production, and of course the singers who were dubbed for the actors were white, which we really have a bizarre twist with this film, especially dubbing black actors. Another problem that arose out of making the film, is that when they did the stage version of Carmen Jones in 1943, the estate of Georges Bizet objected having an all-black cast, because they thought it was vulgar and cheapened the operetta aria in being set in the modern setting and at one point they tried to start a court case, and especially in France in 1981, the film CARMEN JONES finally got to be shown, because the French were not going to be dictated by the Georges Bizet estate. It was pointed out that the character of Carmen Jones by the critics, that we are very far from a fem fatale character, where instead the character of Carmen Jones has a sincere commitment towards the man she loves, even though Carmen Jones hates being dictated to. In the 1940s, they could have had her character as manipulative, but instead Carmen Jones has a sincere commitment towards the man she loves, even though she hates being dictated to. But overall, it is said that the film is all about obsession and desire, especially with GI Joe being totally besotted for Carmen Jones that of course leads to his eventual downfall and especially for both characters at the very end of the film. Dr. Adrian talks about how Dorothy Dandridge career didn't really flourish, also about the short lived affair she had with Otto Preminger, who eventually went back to his wife. Also the only other significant film Dorothy Dandridge appeared in was Porgy and Bess [1959] which again was an American musical film directed by Otto Preminger and  was also based on the 1935 opera Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward, and Ira Gershwin and also starred Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Jr., Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll and Nichelle Nichols, but sadly it was not a great success, because critics felt it was a very flat film. As we get to the penultimate end of the film where the military police arrest GI Joe after killing Carmen Jones, the music that is played was entitled String me High On A Tree, which I suppose is very prophetic in one sense, and of course Otto Preminger ends the film with the everlasting flame, engulfing the red rose, which we of course saw at the start of the film that was produced by the geniuses that was Saul Bass. And so ends this audio commentary by Dr. Adrian Martin, which at times was quite interesting titbits and especially the fact that was Max Roach was an American jazz percussionist, drummer, and composer, who you see drumming in the nightclub scene with Pearl Bailey singing, but other times the information we hear became slightly boring. Anyway, it is entirely up to the viewer if you wish to participate in the audio commentary, which of course is a massive bonus over the American Blu-ray release that only had as the extra the Original Theatrical Trailer. So all in all the BFI [British Film Institute] have done us proud with all the other bonus extras and produced a beautiful presentation all round.

Special Feature: The Guardian Interview: Harry Belafonte At The National Film Theatre [1996] [1080i] [1.33:1] [68:46] Harry Belafonte talks about his career in film and music, and his political activism in this far-reaching interview conducted by the then Guardian editor, Peter Preston. Filmed at the National Film Theatre on the 21st November, 1996 and has been newly edited from Standard Definition video materials preserved by the BFI National Archive. This lengthy on stage interview from 1996 with Harry Belafonte is moderated by Peter Preston, giving a full overview of Belafontes life and career. Harry Belafonte talks about the restricted environment in the early days for blacks appearing on film, his own early career where he had to decide whether he want to pursue a career as a singer or actor, his friendship/rivalry with Sidney Poitier, and his stance on civil rights activism and politics and was always more interested in an acting career in the theatre than in music. Harry Belafonte also talks about the style of acting that has changed over the years and he especially feels it is all down to the influence of Italian cinema, and also the emergence of the actor Marlon Brando who he studied with and was also about the time in his acting career when other actors emerged like Walter Matthau, Rod Steiger, Bea Arthur, Tony Franchise and Tony Curtis. Also at the time there were only white writers who only wrote that was not our black rhythm and our language, and Harry Belafonte admired and often looked at the films from France, films from England and the Italian films with great envy, because those films resonated with a much deeper truth, than Black Americans experienced. Harry Belafonte talks about Hollywood and the games they would play, especially when it comes to yielding a profit and doesnt care morally or immorally and many of us that play the game with Hollywood got to become very aggressive and how we deal with their demands and the kind of position they place us in. When I am in Hollywood they tend to greet me warmly and put ideas towards me in making a film, and the two thinks they hark about is making films like the 1990s or urban America, which usually means city life, especially with confrontational aspects of life and that automatically tells you that they have no room for your history, they have no room for your poetry, they have no great room for the great novels written be several great writers, especially black authors and all of us are relegated to a no mans land and never never land and rarely do you get a director like Robert Altman who would do a film set in the 1930s and about the era of jazz, the community and what happened in that era and definitely showing another dimension of black society. The audience later get to ask questions directly, but because no one in the audience is handed microphones it is incredibly hard to hear their questions. Since BFI has not provided subtitles, youll have to turn it up loud or just try to guess the question through context of the answers. So all in all this was a brilliant session and well worth viewing, as Harry Belafonte is someone I could have listened to for ages, as he is a totally fascinating and intelligent person.

Special Feature: Stills and Posters Gallery [2016] [1080p] [1:27] This newly edited gallery presents original stills and printed materials relating to the film CARMEN JONES. This special feature was newly produced by the BFI National Archive. There are black-and-white and colour stills and an original poster in this gallery which is accompanied by the opening overture of Carmen and easily one of the most recognisable classic music compositions the world has ever known.

BONUS: Beautiful designed illustrated 14 page booklet with new writing by Chris Fujiwara entitled THE CONTRADICTIONS OF CARMEN JONES and who use to be the artistic director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Plus with this brilliant booklet you have the following items: Carmen Jones Credits and Cast; Karen Alexander on Carmen Jones; The Guardian Interview: Harry Belafonte At The National Film Theatre; Audio Commentary by Adrian Martin; Stills and Posters Gallery; About The Presentation and Acknowledgments.

Finally, CARMEN JONES, unites the ultimate adventurous producer/director Otto Preminger with this brilliant African-American sex symbol Dorothy Dandridge in a torrid story that brings Bizet's Carmen up-to-date. Sure, the opera-meets-black-culture concept has to some critics not aged as well as other ambitious projects of the era, but I actually disagree as I think everyone should see this film at least once for sheer historic value and the brilliant Blu-ray packaging. The 20th Century Fox and BFI release sports a totally stunning excellent picture and sound. Despite some nasty critics originally giving this a definite negative thumbs down reception, whereas overall I have always loved this film, as the characters really come alive and especially bringing it up-to-date for the 21st Century. I thought all the actors were totally superb and made Bizet's concept come alive for a modern audience in bringing out the best in Bizet's music that I would rather watch, than the actual opera, as it makes it so much more appealing for a modern audience and now I have it in the ultimate exclusive UK Release Blu-ray format and it is the ultimate version that has been achieve via the very professional British Film Institute that has been available in bringing out this ultimate Blu-ray format visual and audio presentation. Considering that the BFI Blu-ray/DVD release of CARMEN JONES from years back only had a trailer and text biographies as extras, this new release is a massive huge leapt forward, especially in the extras department. The 20th Century Fox Blu-ray editions from the USA and Japan only had the theatrical trailer as an extra, so making the BFI Blu-ray miles ahead in the bonus features department. BFI has done a great job especially with the extras. Very Highly Recommended!

In this modernized version of Georges Bizet's most famous work, his opera ""Carmen,"" Belafonte is Joe, a soldier in an all-black camp, Dandridge portrays sultry Carmen, a parachute factory worker who actively pursues Joe while he's under orders to deliver her to the authorities for starting a fight at work.

At first Joe spurns Carmen's advances, remaining faithful to his fianc&eacute;e (Olga James as Cindy Lou) but during a stopover at her grandma's home she turns up the heat, he weakens and gives in. Carmen escapes during the night, leaving Joe a ""Sorry I'm runnin' but I really love you"" note. Back at camp he's sent to the stockade for letting Carmen get away. Cindy Lou visits Joe just as a package from Carmen arrives. In it she sees a rose; Cindy Lou leaves without a word.

Carmen's in another state, dreaming of the day Joe is released and Joe keeps her rose, obsessing over her, too. Those familiar with the original opera know this story's outcome and newcomers will want to find out for themselves how things end up.

Bizet's many oh-so-familiar tunes have been spiffed up with new lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. Highlights include Pearlie Mae's exciting ""Beat Out Dat Rhythm on a Drum"" and Marilyn Horne (as Carmen's voice) rendering a scornfully seductive ""Dat's Love"":

You go for me and I'm taboo
But if you're hard to get, I'll go for you
And if I do, then you are through

Best may be Marvin Hayes (vocally standing in for Joe Adams) as heavyweight boxer Husky Miller. His determined take on the Toreador Song is called ""Stan' Up and Fight.""

559029,5,6303102425,"The original story here was written by Prosper Mrime and it was set to music in 1874 by Georges Bizet. The music and the essentials of the story line are retained in this film version, with an all-black cast, of Billy Rose's Broadway show of 1943: but the setting is quite different. The film score was composed by Oscar Hammerstein and the production and direction were by Otto Preminger.

Cigarette girl Carmen (Dorothy Dandridge, sung by Marilyn Horne) has now become a worker in a parachute packing factory. She is chasing after a G.I. Joe (Harry Belafonte, sung by LeVern Hutcherson, who also sang Porgy in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess). The love triangle is completed by sweet, nave Cindy Lou (Olga James), Joe's current sweetheart.

Joe gets into a dispute with his sergeant (Brock Peters) over Carmen and is forced to arrest her, giving her the perfect opportunity to seduce him. Once she has accomplished this, she moves on to a prize fighter, Husky Miller (played by Joe Adams, with singing dubbed by Marvin Hayes). I won't describe the ending, though opera buffs will already know what to expect.

As a further popularization of an already popular opera, the film works well so, even if you don't know the original, or even if you do, sit back and enjoy the music in this adaptation.",1345075200,,1291,4.754464285714286

Not only did she become the first Black woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Leading Actress in 1955, Dandridge showed the world that a Black woman can show steamy sex appeal like famous white women of the era, like Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner, Joan Collins, and Jayne Mansfield! ""Carmen Jones"" is perfect on story, music, and romance! Dorothy and Harry Belafonte have superb chemisty together. The only reason I did give this film five stars was because the studio decided not to use Dandridge's or Belafonte's singing voices. They had unknown opera singers do their singing. Why? But anywho, this film is great. I can't imagine anybody else as Carmen or Joe. But just think Dorothy was almost cast as Cindy Lou and I don't know Lena Horne or Eartha Kitt as Carmen. So I highly suggest that you purchase the film for the superb performances, musical numbers, dancing, and just the all around fun!!!!!!!",1343174400,3,955,4.793939393939394
559114,4,6303102425,"I remember seeing ""Island in the Sun"" about 15 years ago and loving the quiet dignity with which Dorothy played her role.  She was undeniably gorgeous.  I was just a kid then, but I was blown away by her beauty and talent.  I fell in love with her immediately.  I was a shy, nerdy girl who idolized Marilyn Monroe but Dorothy showed me that I could also have a Black icon who rivaled Marilyn in beauty and sexiness.

Then I saw ""Carmen Jones"".  Carmen spells trouble with a capital T...you can feel it the minute she struts into the room in her iconic outfit of black top and red skirt, a rose tucked into her sultry dark tresses.  She isn't a girl anyone can easily say ""no"" to.  What Carmen wants, Carmen gets.  And what she wants is another woman's man, played by Harry Belafonte.

Dorothy simply dazzles in this film.  Otto Preminger mistakenly believed her to be too sweet and wholesome to play Carmen, but Dorothy showed him that she certainly could!  This is one of the few movies of its time that depicts African Americans in a positive light.  Although Dorothy endured racism in Hollywood and elsewhere, she showed Black women that they could play more than mammies and maids on the silver screen.

The sexual tension is electrifying and viewers will be able to tell that Carmen doesn't give a hoot about her reputation.  She is a vixen to the core.  Unfortunately, Dorothy Dandridge never achieved the level of stardom that her white counterpart, Marilyn Monroe, did.  She died lonely and nearly destitute in 1965.

My only issue with ""Carmen Jones"" isn't really a complaint, as obviously I love this movie.  But I do wonder why Dorothy's voice was dubbed while singing.  She had a rich, lovely voice that didn't need any help.",1340150400,3,1737,4.61437908496732

559180,5,6303102425,"I decided to purchase ""Carmen Jones"" for a number of reasons.  Chief among these reasons is that this movie is historical for my race, African-American.  Dorothy Dandridge was the first African-American woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress.  Secondly, I am a huge Dorothy Dandridge fan and decided to purchase one of her movies since I had never seen one in its entirety.  Many have raved about the elegance she exudes on screen as well as her outstanding skill as an actress.  I finally see what everyone means!  She was a remarkably talented actress, and I can utter that after only seeing one of her motion pictures.  She was really ahead of her time.

 ""Carmen Jones"" is about an extremely confident woman who pursues then acquires any man she wants, even if he is involved with someone else.  However, she meets a fatal attraction (Harry Belafonte).  She loves him and leaves him, but he won't have of it.  He tries to get into several physical altercations with Carmen's new object of affection (who is ironically a boxer).  He even threatens both of their lives.  Things become tragic by the motion picture's end.

 The overall acting in this movie is superb.  These actors look like naturals and brought so much purity to the screen.  I am not a fan of opera, but I enjoyed the music.  It was not an overbearing amount of music so that made it easier.  Also, this was the first old movie I have watched with my undivided attention.  I always felt like old movies wouldn't be edited properly and would look unprofessional.  I was so wrong! Overall, the movie was edited very well.

 I will definitely be watching this movie a lot in the future.  I won't put boundaries on promoting this film.  It is one that I feel any and every one can take something from, so it is highly recommended to all! 5 shining stars!",1200009600,,1841,4.587692307692308

But my main beef with this film is the music.  It doesn't fit this backdrop or these characters.  I understand it's an adapted Opera-but honestly, these characters look silly to me singing (or lip-synching) these songs.  They're singing opera but saying things like ""Dat-Dem-De-Knowed""  WTF?

Adapted from a legendary opera, Carmen, and the successful Broadway musical, it is a timeless story which explores the consequences when a deep devotion leads to personal anguish and then to intense, tragic rage.

The movie won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture and Dorothy Dandridge - in a sizzling performance as Carmen Jones - was the first black woman nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress. The film was selected for preservation by the U.S. National Film Registry.

The cast is nothing less than outstanding, with Harry Belafonte (Joe) and Joe Adams (heavyweight fighter, Husky Miller) capturing the emotional turmoil and consequences in striving to be Carmen's only lover. Olga James (Cindy Lou), Pearl Bailey (Frankie), Diahann Carroll (Mert) and Brock Peters (Sgt. Brown) are captivating in their roles.

Adapted to film by Oscar Hammerstaein III - who wrote the dialogue & lyrics for the musical - and Harry Kleiner & directed by Otto Preminger, the movie was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical.

I was very young at the time and not living in the US and was not privee to the political climate here.  I waited to see this film a second time and saw a 'cut up' version on TV in the 60's.  Despite its condition and the breaks for mindless commercials, the film was still entertaining and Carmen was dazzling.  The film seemed to 'disappear' after that until the 1980's when I saw a showing at the Public Theatre in New York City - bless Mr. Papp for screeing it.  Over the years, I have seen many operas and now know how 'grand opera' is presented.  Still, I think that this is a valant effort and is worth seeing.  The lyrics are great and worthy of the music.  Ms Dainbridge remains excellent as Carmen and was certainly was sexy, as Carmen should be - unlike so many that have played the part in grand opera!

""Carmen Jones"" is a great film on any level. Yes,

we've all heard about Dandridge's groundbreaking

success and the racial progress that she incurred

with this film. However, even if you were not aware

of this, the movie still stands as a remarkable product

of Otto Preminger's mastery.

Yes, it's slow in some places, and you

find yourself going through withdrawal,

just waiting for the next glimpse of the

stunning Dandridge. However, this movie delivers

with a flavorful punch. Without a doubt, it lives up to

it's hype and beyond.  Good story line, beautiful

leading actors (Belafonte/Dandridge, a match made

in movie heaven), fun music, and an entertaining

interpretation of the original opera.

This is a great movie for everyone.

PS:  just a little information here.

People often wonder why two professional singers (Belafonte/Dandridge) would have their voices dubbed in the movie. Well, first of all, Dandridge was a pop/night club performer and it is highly unlikely that she had the vocal range nor the appropriate voice ability to tackle the classic mezzo-soprano role. Likewise, with Belafonte, who was also a pop singer. However, I do suspect that he could have vocally pulled off the tenor role. Perhaps, it was a question of taste by the producers. Diahann Caroll is also dubbed. Pearl Baily, however, is not dubbed.(????????)What's that all about?",1107734400,9,1618,5.111111111111111

559322,5,6303102425,"1954's Carmen Jones is a classic film of great value. Otto Preminger directed the film in the new CinemaScope, Dorothy Dandridge was a black actress in the pre-Civil Rights Movement period to be playing a serious role and it's an easy transition into the Georges Bizet French opera from which it was based. The movie used Bizet's music but they translated the lyrics into English. Dorothy Dandrige stars as Carmen Jones and Harry Belafonte as Joe, or Carmen and Don Jose respectively. The film was successful, since it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's concept. The film is like a realistic musical without too much sugar or sunshine. The story of Carmen, itself drawn from the French short novel by Prosper Merimee, is a dark story of passion and obscession that results in a crime of passion, the death of Carmen as she is stabbed by the jealous Joe. Carmen, a free spirit, gets into all sorts of trouble, oozes sensuality and sex appeal, and wins all the men with her Habanera song. When she seduces Joe in a World War II military camp, he abandons his homely and well-mannered girlfriend Cindy Lou (Micaela in the opera) he lives with Carmen as lovers. But the affair declines for Carmen who takes an interest in the attractive boxer Oscar Miller (a play on the name Escamillo from the opera who was a bullfighter). Joe gets decisively jealous and begs Carmen to forget about the boxer and continue their romance. The last scene is particularily impressive, and is full of taut, dramatic tension. The rest of the movie is of course all musical numbers and dramatic scenes, such as Carmen Jones discovering her doom through reading the cards and reading her death card. The whole thing is a miracle to watch, because it seems to work effectively as both musical and opera. It's highly enjoyable and I recommend anyone interested in the opera Carmen to watch it.",1086134400,5,1860,4.761609907120743

559354,5,6303102425,"When one thinks of the great screen couples, one of the two was slightly more appealing physically than the other. Nelson Eddy with his chiseled looks flattered the screen better than his frequent co-star Jeannette McDonald. Robert Taylor, Tony Curtis, and Paul Newman outshone their respective real-life and film spouses Barbara Stanwyck, Janet Leigh, and Joanne Woodward. His female co-star always overshadowed Humphrey Bogart, especially when that co-star was wife Lauren Bacall. Elizabeth Taylor was definitely more appealing to the eye than husband and seven-time co-star Richard Burton.
And it seems that the actress had to have something special to be in front of the camera with Cary Grant. It might not be just a coincidence that beauties such as Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, and Audrey Hepburn shared screen time with Mr. Grant.
Even the late-lamented movie duo of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman had the camera favoring the ""top gun"".
Only did Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn match each other in the ""serviceable"" looks department.
The point of the aforementioned is that ""Carmen Jones"" has the distinction of featuring two performers that not only matched each other in the acting arena but also were as aesthetically compatible as any great work of art. Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte are just too pretty to behold in this Technicolor marvel. The camera just seems to capture every flawless angle of their picturesque features.
Opera ""purists"" may scoff at the liberties taken in Bizet's composition, but film buffs realize that ""Jones"" was a landmark film, featuring an awesome (and at that time, unprecedented) array of African-American talent. From the major performers (including Pearl Bailey, Olga James, and Diahann Carroll) to the familiar character actors handling minor but significant parts (Roy Glenn, Brock Peters, and Nick Stewart), the film is worthy of time capsule placement as an icon in American cinema.

The mesmerizing Dorothy Dandridge is Carmen, the femme fatale who bewitches a GI (Harry Belafonte) leading to tragedy. The film is set in the present and retains the operatic score in English but unnecessarily performed with black dialect. This idiosyncrasy may have its' defenders but I found it rather stereotypical. At any rate, it's beautifully done and dubbed perfectly with the cast. Carmen is portrayed as the ultimate material girl---at once heartless yet vulnerable. She renounces her relationship with the lovesick GI to pursue her pot of gold with an up-and-coming boxer. Film depicts the sexuality of Carmen with earthy frankness surprising for the time. It has a European feel to it. Dandridge should have gotten an Oscar for this but racial prejudices being what they were at the time shut her out---a damnable outrage but this was the 50's and white audiences evidently weren't ready to see such a frank modern performance by a black actress.

7837190,3,6303102425,"I saw bit and pieces of this film over the years but I never saw it all the way through until today.  I bought the BD (Blu-Ray) because I wanted to see how an old-time film looked on BD since I have a fairly new HDTV with HDR (I may review that soon...) and it makes BD's look MUCH better than they did on my non-HDR 4K TV.

VIDEO:  I expected a West Side Story type of picture quality (that film is not too much older than this one) where colors popped, depth was strong and detail was like being there - but the quality looked like a film of that era.  I would argue that it looked like a 1940's color film - I mean, it is from 1954...

It still looked good only that very fine detail that you are used to seeing on BD was not there.  Some colors (mainly red) were kind of muted and satin did not come of as satin, it came off as a water color painting.  Hair looked good and you can see the detail and gradation, so that was no problem.  Jewelry (diamonds, metals and plastic pearls) was able to shine, but they lacked that usual BD 'pop' of such things where they almost look good enough to clearly separate themselves from organic matter (people) and textiles.  Diamonds fairly glittered, but they did not 'pop' off of the screen to make you pay attention and marvel it them.  Metals shined, but much the same as the diamonds.  The plastic pearls stood out more...

Water looked more realistic as well as dirt and foliage.  Clothing stood out as being well defined with distinct colors and designs.  Building interiors looked realistic, distinct and detailed.  You can see paint patterns, Coke bottles looking like glass, the color of coffee looked like coffee, distinct lights and other things on the city streets were able to be made out.  Colors were not popping off of the screen, and they were less powerful than a West Side Story, which appeared to have been stylized, but not with any effects.  To compare, let's say that Carmen Jones has half the color detail of West Side Story.

Film grain was strong but not overpowering.  Grain DID subtract from detail, but I think it is due more to film stock used more than anything.  I don't attribute it to film age because movies around the same time period could look newer and better, and films from 20 years prior to this one could look newer and better as well.  You WILL see the grain and it interfere with RESOLUTION, but not the picture quality.  It is no where near like ""All the President's Men,"" which had high powered grain!  You can get past the grain in Carmen Jones.

Audio:  I was shocked to see that this film had 4 channel stereo in it's original release!  In my 5.1 setup, I only heard audio from the left/right and center channel speaks - no rears or sub.  The stereo panning effects are strongly featured throughout the film and it is good to know this was how it was!  If a fourth channel could have kicked in, it would have been like having surround sound from the mid 50's!  Voice were clear and distinct at all times.  In fact, the sound had the clarity of an early to mid 90's film!  The only time the sound turned weaker and less clear was when the singing started.

As for the film itself, to many black women - this is a classic!  To me, this was no bad, but not a classic to ME.  Why not?  Well, I was not around in the 50's or 60's, but I cannot imagine blacks in America sining like some white people from the period!  It was as if once the singing started, white performers took over - except of Pearl Baily's set.  Baily was the only one who sang a song and in a way that I could say ""that is a black person!""  I don't know if the majority of the songs were like that for cross-over appeal, but all but two songs (Baily and Dandridge)dragged the film to me.

Lastly, this whole film was produced by the usual controllers of Hollywood with simply a black cast in place.  Everything was conceived and written from THEIR perspective and placed on blacks.  You can see it in the performances.  Since they control Hollywood, they make films to study different groups for control purposes.  Black Americans have unique styles and abilities like no other.  Others try to duplicate, understand or destroy to get on equal footing, but when the structure of a film is not black - you can see, hear and FEEL that it is black from the minds of someone else.

A prime example that I like to use are films like ""Shaft,"" ""Shaft's:Big Score,"" ""Shaft in Africa"" and ""Superfly.  The first two Shaft films (I understand who wrote the Shaft books, which I did not read, but I doubt they were like the film in soul) were directed by Gordon Parks and you can clearly see, hear, feel and related to the 'soul' or 'blackness' of those films when blacks are in control of the substance.  Then you look at ""Shaft in Africa"" which was directed by a white guy and you can clearly see, hear and feel that it has little relation to the first two films aside from Shaft himself!

Superfly was directed by Park's so, and this film is a film that no white (non-muslim, non-Christian) person could EVER make about black Americans!  This was TOO real for them to ever conceive and write.  Many have and continue to try, but we can tell!

So, Carmen Jones is a decent film and I would argue that it would have been even better if they would have cut out the singing because the story itself is not bad - until you hear the singing!  Take the singing out and I would give it almost 4 stars.  It's hard to believe some of the stars are still around, as old as this is!
