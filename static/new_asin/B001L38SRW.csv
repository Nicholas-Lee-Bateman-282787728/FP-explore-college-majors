3678274,5,B001L38SRW,"WOW! It is about time that someone made fitness for ALL women! I am so impressed and so moved to see Curvy and Shapely women working out and getting both fit and healthy! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE how Debra emphasizes that Fitness and Health comes in all shapes and sizes! This woman not only talks the talk but walks the walk! I am so glad that us average sized (size 12 & 14) as well as Plus-Sized women have safe, effective, and motivating fitness DVDs that are quality and fun to use! It is a horrible myth that one cannot be healthy or fit if you are ""over weight"" or ""over sized"". Definitely not true!

This DVD offers basic choreography at a moderate pace. There are several modifications shown whether it be different step heights or no arm movements. I have only done Cathe Friedrich step in the past from both her beginner thru advanced titles and have to say that Cathe has now taken a backseat to Debra with regards to Step. No this is not as intense as Cathe, but that's the point! It's non-itimidating, motivating, and fairly easy on the joints; unlike Cathe. I have knee issues as well as joint problems with 1 hip and at age 27, I can't afford to beat my body up for the sheer purpose of vanity, in hopes of being ""smaller one day"". Healthy and fit are so much more important than size and that message is really hammered home with Debra. We don't have to suffer along in boring or long workouts with Cathe, Amy Bento, Jillian, ect to look and feel great! Fitness can be fun and now IS! There's a revolution going on within the fitness and health industry and Debra is helping to lead the way! I am so proud of myself and my size, it's about time that someone indulges us ""Shapely Girls"" with appropriate, beneficial, fun, safe, and effective fitness! I own all 4 Shapely Workouts and look forward to Debra releasing more! Get this DVD, it is well worth the money! The movements are non-complicated, easy on the body, the music is fab, and EVERY women big or small can do it! Fitness no longer has to kill you to be effective, Thank God and Thank you Debra!

I also want to add that she uses Top 40 music and no two songs are repeated amongst her 4 DVDs. If you are an Advanced Exreciser you would find this workout great for a light to mderate workout, something to compensate for more demanding cardio routines like Cathe Friedrich or Amy Bento. If you are a faithful Leslie Sansone fan, tis one is more intense than any Leslie DVD IMHO, including her 5 Mile Walks. You can get a moderate, yet energizing workout with no risers, but add 1-2 sets of risers and be prepared for a step sweatfest! I personally am so tired of Leslie's same boring workouts, with the same boring movements, with little to no ""umph"". Debra's DVDs are amazing and I recommend this and the other 3 whole-heartedly to anyone! I love her and her workouts. I am praying that Debra releases another Step workout!!",1249689600,54,2895,4.409345794392523
3678275,5,B001L38SRW,"I really like this workout.  In my 20's I used step aerobics to lose some weight and had the legs of my life.  Fast forward 15 years later . . . I got away from workingout and I have gained weight.  I bought this DVD because I hoped that it would ease me back into working out.

I first did the DVD yesterday.  I thought the DVD was going to be below my fitness level.  I walk every day and use the elliptical.  I can't say that I push myself hard--I just do it and try to enjoy it.  I also rotate in a Firm DVD.  So, I thought I was in good shape--decent at least.  So, I started the DVD and was exaggerating the moves intending on getting a good workout.  I assumed this DVD was a little below my level.  Well, I was wrong.  A couple of times I had to march in place to catch my breath.  I insisted that I was going to use my arms and that I was in good shape.  Clearly, I am not--I about killed myself and should have dropped the arms at some point but refused.  After the workout I felt exhausted--not in a good way--in a I am not going to do anything a while way.

Today I did the DVD without raising my arms above my head and got a good workout.  I love the DVD.  It is simple and straightforward.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I would have liked a more thorough stretch but I just do my own after the DVD.  I like Debra.  Again, she is straightforward.  I do not like the Denise Austin type of rah rah DVD's--the first couple of times that rah rah is ok but after doing the DVD over and over again it is way too much and annoying.

With Debra, she just tells us what the next steps are, counts, etc.  Nothing over the top just a good solid workout.  Also, the people on her ""team"" or regular people.  They aren't the perfectly toned size zero's that we see so often in other DVD's.  I use to think that the perfectly toned people in other DVD's were inspiring but I found that these women inspired me more.  I would want to take a break and march but I wouldn't let myself . . . I would say ""Ok, Gina, if they can do it you have to be able to do it--toughen up--quit whining"".

I think this is  an intermediate DVD.  I have the firm DVD's and feel that this got me sweating more and working harder.  If it is too hard you can drop your arms like I did or use a shorter step.  If you are not getting enough of a workout you can use a higher step.

There is a toning segment after the workout that I haven't done yet.  It seems to be about 10 minutes.  I watched it and forgot to time it.  Just solid basic moves.  If you are new to stepping there is an intro that will show you all of the moves and help you ease into stepping.  Stepping is a great way to shape and tone your lower body.  Stepping also gives you a more intense workout.  I am looking forward to reshaping my body again and think this is just the ticket.

The workout is just under 40 minutes with a 4 minute warm up and a 3 minute cool down.  The music isn't overwhelming--just right.  I wish Debra would make more step DVD's to integrate with this one!

3678276,4,B001L38SRW,"Debra's group of ""shapely girls"" certainly does provide motivation and inspiration. I am a shapely girl myself and it can be discouraging to see a group of perfect hardbodies working out and telling me that I can do it, too. The workout itself is quite intense for someone of my fitness level. I am in my 50s and quite overweight. I have done mostly low-impact aerobics and walking in recent years, so the intensity of the step added a challenge for me. Debra herself is very much a regular person; it's like listening to your Aunt Sally from Bayonne. But she understands how the body works and what it needs to get fit. The only things that I found disconcerting were that she frequently seems very out of breath, and her cuing is sometimes a little off. She will say one thing and do another. On one combo, it seemed to me that she was doing ham curls to the left and kicks to the right, all the while telling you to do ham curls. It got a tad confusing. But all in all, it is certainly worth doing this workout if you are not a veteran stepper. The toning segment that follows was good as well, but she does the last part of it at a quick pace that got my heart rate up again, and provided no cool down afterwards. I just walked in place until my heart rate returned to normal, but it seemed awkward to me.",1230681600,30,1309,4.24
3678277,5,B001L38SRW,"What a great step workout! The choreography is deceptively simple, but really gets your heartrate up - easy footwork makes it a breeze to follow. Debra adds some fun arm/leg combos - and her cuing is excellent. The four women stepping with her show various easy/hard modifications (for example, lowest step height, no arms, highest step height, etc.). I've been stepping a while, and I found it very easy to add challenge by just exaggerating the movements or adding some plyo (leaping) where needed. A short but very effective toning section at the end is also excellent. I recommend this DVD very highly!",1228867200,47,606,4.893203883495145
3678278,5,B001L38SRW,"I was very pleased with the video, the steps were demonstrated for you so anyone could learn them, and there are great, motivating exercise routines that keep me coming back for more.  These ladies look like me which made me feel much less intimidated than some other exercise videos.  The instructor and cast all all cheerful and positive.  I have tried other videos and can't seem to make them part of my exercise routine, but this one is actually gets used on a regular basis instead of collecting dust in the storage cabinet.",1494115200,,529,4.666666666666667

3678283,5,B001L38SRW,"I did step aerobics in a gym when I was a teen and loved it. I wanted to get back into shape but I don't have time or money to do a gym and I find treadmills pretty boring. I just tried this one for the first time and even though it was challenging from being out of shape and not having done it since I was 17  (so 15 years ago) it was a lot like the classes I used to do at the gym. I love the fact that the ladies in this video are not teensy little ""make the rest of us feel bad"" size 2 looking gals. They look like people you know, they are just in shape. I do like this one much better than the Kathy Smith one. The Kathy Smith one is fine, its just this one seems a bit more modern and definitely more beginner friendly. Another added bonus is that there are 4 people stepping at once in the video, but they will all do it at different levels to show how it can be done at different fitness levels (with/without arms, with no risers, one riser, two risers etc.) I feel like this is definitely something I can commit to!",1484352000,,1026,3.8857142857142857
3678284,5,B001L38SRW,"I really like this workout.  Only managed to make it through 15 minutes so far but I'm working on it.  I tried two other step workouts and they were way too fast for me.  I'm 69, about 100 lbs overweight and have artificial knees.  I felt that I needed practice on steps and this was my third try at finding a workout that I can keep up with.  I'm only on 4"" step so far, but as soon as I make it through the whole workout I'm going to increase that.  You need the wider step for this, depending on how wide your stance is, because there is one part where you do a wide step on it.  The step I had was only 27"" which was a little narrow for me  and I have ordered a 40"" one which will work better. All of the background people are plus size, which makes you feel that you can do it too.  I'm trying to get in better shape and think this workout will help me do that!",1480809600,,866,3.847457627118644

3678286,2,B001L38SRW,She talks to much at the beginning as well as it takes a long time for the work out to start. They should have made it so you can jump right to the workout.,1471132800,3,156,3.6176470588235294
3678287,5,B001L38SRW,"I ordered this when I first starting to work out after an extended inert period due to health issues.  I have been so far removed from the exercise world that I thought this was a walking workout, but STEPPING is different.  Oops.  I tried to do this without the step and was not following (this was all me, not the coach!), but did watch the tape to get an idea about what's involved.  I think her instruction in the beginning is really, really good.  Her workout is also clear with good cues.  She is a normal person, she isn't a polished gym goddess and is someone you can really follow and not feel intimidated.  When I get to the point where I can incorporate stepping, I will be happy to have this video.",1470700800,5,710,4.293233082706767
3678288,3,B001L38SRW,The routine is really difficult and too long.  I can't finish it at one shot.  She is also annoying and seems rude to some of her girls.,1469232000,3,136,4.0
3678289,5,B001L38SRW,This is a perfect DVD for beginners. I have never done step aerobics before but was able to make it through the  entire DVD my first time. I'm still comfortable with it. Not ready to move on to a more  advanced workout yet. I still have plenty of room for improvement with this one. I don't totally keep up with her & would like to work towards that goal. I get a good workout with it. I am 69 years old & in reasonable physical condition. I exercise at a gym & do water aerobics & a lot of walking as well. I wanted to add something new to my routine for some variety and this is perfect. I can do it at home on those days I don't get out anywhere. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a beginners step aerobics class.,1465257600,4,725,3.9931034482758623

3678294,5,B001L38SRW,I used to have an aversion to step workouts. With my lack of coordination and balance I was always afraid I'd misstep and injure myself. I have no such worries with this workout. I found the moves very easy to learn. Don't let the size of the ladies put you off. Mazda gives off a vibe that can make anyone feel welcome and positive.,1457827200,2,333,4.21875
3678295,1,B001L38SRW,"This video is mislabeled.  The only ""beginner"" portion is the short tutorial.  Once she gets into the main workout, she goes much too fast for any beginner to keep up.

3678297,5,B001L38SRW,Love this step workout DVD.  The instructor explains and demonstrates every step thoroughly so it makes sense and is easy to follow.  It is perfect for step beginners and also allows each person to adapt to their own level of fitness by increasing the bench height and doing more arm work.  I will not get bored with this one.  The other plus is that the class is made up of women of all sizes which was more motivating for me.,1453680000,11,427,4.3

3678301,3,B001L38SRW,"This is a good dvd for beginners who may be only slightly experienced with stepping. The tutorial explains everything, which is great. There are options to choose a short workout (31 minutes using the first 4 combination of steps or 24 minutes using the second set of combination steps), but the entire non-stop step section is an hour long with no real opportunity for cooling down between combinations. I found the steps easy to follow, and the music is okay, but honestly, the instructor drove me nuts with her constant talking! I wish there was an option to do this workout with just the music. I really liked the workout but the instructor grated on my nerves. Plus, she loses count, flails her arms around in the ""no arms"" sections, doesn't give enough warning before switching steps and though I'm sure she thinks she's being encouraging, her constant chattering just got on my nerves. She's definitely not as ""polished"" as some of the other instructors out there, but not everyone can be Kathy Smith.",1452643200,2,1008,4.7988505747126435

So, I did some research and came upon Debra Mazda's DVD and decided to try it out.  I am so much happier with this DVD because it is actually an aerobic workout that I can actually do.  I have been very pleased with it and gives me a great workout!!  I love it!",1428278400,9,446,4.337349397590361
3678313,5,B001L38SRW,I have done step aerobics and am out of practice and out of shape!  This is the best video I have seen for beginners as well as those of us who are out of shape. She uses real people in her exercise video instead of the size zero or two fitness models that you usually see.  She also motivates and continually reminds the audience to keep moving.  I love the fact the group is not all in sync with every exact movement as they each tailor it to their fitness level which is exactly what I was doing while using the video.  This DVD was worth every penny I paid.,1428019200,10,561,4.072727272727272
3678314,5,B001L38SRW,Debra and all the Shapely Girl DVDs are wonderful.  She is an excellent teacher. I love the music she uses for the DVD - though sometimes the transitions could be better.

She appears to be very real and down to earth.  It's encouraging to watch ladies in this video whose bodies are more on the average/normal side rather than looking like a ""model"".  Even their outfits are more the norm as opposed to looking like a ""fashionista"".  I am definitely breaking a sweat half way through this video.

However, it might be a bit confusing for someone who is totally new to working out because there are several miscues, both verbal and physical, even in the tutorial.

3678327,5,B001L38SRW,"Even though this is marketed to plus-sized women, anyone can do this workout.  The choreography  is simple, but not boring.  It's a bit longer than your typical beginner step routine at 37 minutes, but she gives a lot of options to tailor the workout to your fitness level.  For one, there are a few premixes with shorter times (22 and 25).  Also, one of the exercisers does a 'no-arm' workout, which helps me a lot, as I have neck problems and can't do any fast arm movements at the moment.  This is also helpful for those just starting out, or who haven't exercised in a long time.  She also provides a tutorial which explains all the moves used in the program.

Lastly, Debra's positive attitude is infectious.  She's very encouraging and enthusiastic, yet down to earth.  And knowing that she, herself, struggled with weight problems and succeeded in losing over half her body weight (she used to be over 300 pounds) through old fashioned diet and exercise - and kept it off - is very motivating. It reminds me to keep going!

Of course, anyone who is advanced or likes complex choreography will want to skip this one.  But for beginners, or those who like to keep it simple, this is a keeper!",1411603200,2,1197,4.568075117370892

3678331,4,B001L38SRW,"Debra Mazda is a good instructor.  She seems very caring and really tries to energize and motivate during the routine.  She is good at cuing but sometimes doesn't follow her own instructions which can be a little confusing to someone new to step.  The routine is fairly simple which makes it easy to catch on.  Additionally, she does a tutorial in the beginning which demonstrates all of the different moves.  I'm finding this workout great for during the week, when I don't have as much time.  I also really like the bonus toning section and the premixes which allow the viewer choose a shorter workout until their fitness level increases.  Overall this is a good routine that will make you sweat if you put the effort into it.  It also is helping me to build up my cardio so I can progress to a higher level.",1399420800,2,810,4.5

I got this DVD about a month ago and having been doing the first 25-30 minutes 3-4 times a week since. I find it easy to follow (I am not the most coordinated person) and like that the women seem like real women. I get a sweat going, and I feel myself getting better at it each time.

I used to do step aerobics and loved it in my 20's and 30's.  I felt like I was in shape back then, so I decided to go back to my roots and dust off the step that I had stored in my basement.  It was very easy getting back into it.  I wasn't sure how hard it would be because I had fractured my ankle last December and couldn't work until April because of surgery.  Then my  opposite knee started hurting in June from using crutches.  I feel like I am building my muscles back up.  I only do it every 3rd day so I can recooperate.

3678341,4,B001L38SRW,"PROS:  Easy step routine, No jumping jacks, or jumping at all.  Not annoying as an instructor.  (Not a fan of Denise Austin.)  Able to choose shorter versions of the routine, or just the toning section.  Shows various levels of exercise.  Music is good.  Step rhythm is up beat, not too slow.  Has toning section for arms and abs, very basic.
CONS:  Could do better with cueing next step, more consistent, use better terminology for step style.  More consistent with using arms during work out.

I watched this video on U tube to see if I would like it.  I am glad I purchased it and plan to use it 5 days a week.  I will increase intensity by raising my step and using my arms more as I get in better shape.  I enjoy Debra as an instructor.  It's not a perfect tape, but I enjoy the step style that she has chosen.

The workout is about an hour and is extremely tough.  It's an intermediate-advance level.  I don't know any beginner who could get though the entire workout without stopping.  I hate stopping -- not completing a workout, but had no choice with this one.  I used no risers yet still could not make all the way though.  I stopped and cooled down near the ""tripple and L section.""

I had to quit stepping due to a skiing injury, and never got back to the classes. In the meantime I gained a significant amount of weight and was terrified I would never make it through a step workout again. When I found this DVD that was made specifically for real women with real curves, I was anxious to try it in the privacy of my own living room. Her workout is motivating and she teaches you all the moves you will need in a tutorial prior to the full work-out.  I appreciated that the women working out with her on the DVD were also voluptuous vixens. Her personal story of going from a 300# size 26 to a now much slimmer and healthier size 12 was enough to make me get off the couch and start moving.

Also, Debra is a bit annoying and preachy.  I like the fact that the women in the class were not thin and fit women because it does show that anyone can do this routine, but it just wasn't to my taste. If you're a basic beginning stepper who is looking for an easy routine than by all means get this dvd.

First, Debra gives very clear instructions.  I watched the tutorial first and then did the workout, and she is so easy to follow.

Second, it's a good workout!  I did it on the floor first, no step, just to see where I was, and I was sweating!  I am looking forward to increasing my fitness level by doing this workout.

Third, I have to say that Debra is inspirational.  She really made me feel like I could do this.  All the encouragement she gives really helps me.  And I love that the other women were normal looking.  I don't want to be yelled at and I don't want to keep comparing myself to size 0 women, because that is not me and never will be.  Debra is empowering.  I feel really good after the workout and it makes me want to come back and do it again.

3678369,5,B001L38SRW,"Just to get this out in the open, the thing I hate about this dvd is that I end up so sweaty, I have to shower immediately after finishing the workout, stripping my clothes away as I flee.

Now. I love this workout! It's simple, fairly easy, and fun, but I know I'm getting a killer workout. I'm about 5'8"", 230-ish pounds. I was teetering around 200 before getting pregnant, but ever since having my daughter, I've gained some love weight, as well as 'I don't get out and do much anymore' weight, so now it's more. A few years ago, I played tennis in school, and I lost a ton of weight from the intensity of the workout, so I know my body is capable and fairly fit for a person of my size.

Yet, this workout kicks my ass! Every morning, I put on my shoes and just some shorts and a workout bra, put this dvd in, and start stepping with my step on its lowest setting. Even with it at its lowest, and only doing 30 minutes of the 56 minute program, I feel a killer workout!

She starts with marching in place and a few other things as a workout. Then you do a few steps like this, a few like that, then you do a this-that combo! Then she gives you steps 3 and steps 4, then you do a combo of 3 and 4! It's a great approach to it. You don't have time to get bored of any one move.

She's not unreasonable, either. She keeps you motivated by saying 'don't give up', 'you can do it', 'this is how you get skinny', and telling about how when she first started exercising, she sucked, too, haha.

I feel like this workout is sneaky in that I don't realize how much of a workout I'm getting while I do it. It's so fun, the time flies by! It's not till I'm finished with the cooldown that I realize I'm super sweaty and winded and definitely feeling GREAT about my body and my future!",1299974400,,1777,4.065714285714286
3678370,4,B001L38SRW,"I'm new to ""step aerobics"" and purchased this dvd because of other reviews I had read.  I'm 57 years old and working on losing 55 pounds.  Getting back into ""exercise"" has been difficult since I'm so out of shape and carrying that extra weight.  I was looking for a dvd that wasn't to hard on the knees as I have 1 that is bad.  Debra is a good teacher and very motivating.  There is an excellent tutorial at the beginning that walks you through each movement and allows you the time to practice until you get it ""right"".  Once I had mastered the moves I moved on to the actual Step session.  Being new I did not add any risers to my step, I figured if I could get through the entire thing I'd be doing good!

The moves are basic and easy to master.  Her cues are pretty good, there were a few spots that you had better be paying attention when she changes...but after a few times I knew where these were so it wasn't a problem.  Your gonna sweat, oh yeah you will!  I was dripping by the end.  Want a bigger challenge and a tougher workout....add a riser!  Easy to follow, great for people like me with ""two left feet"", gets your heart rate up and holds it there for a great cardio workout.  It did not bother my bad knee either.  I have since gone on to add that first riser and had to ditch it because that little ""extra"" DID bother my knee....but even with no risers it's a great workout.  This is NOT ""dancy""...I have no coordination and dislike those dvd's that are more dance than exercise. Her ""team"" are real women of size and are motivating in their own right, if they can do this and keep up it gives you something to work toward!  I really detest the 80 pound women in the background of most dvd's, you know the ones that you can bouce a quarter off their abs!  These are plus size gals that can MOVE!

I would of given this a 5 star rating but I personally felt the warm up and the cool down needed to be longer, especially the cool down.  I know this and stop the dvd and do my own cool down then start it again to follow through with the stretching.  I wish she would make more step dvd's because I do like her style.",1299024000,9,2132,4.12621359223301

3678372,5,B001L38SRW,"I just got this workout, and tried it this morning.  I really enjoyed it!  I hover somewhere in between beginner and intermediate level, probably more beginner these days.  I used to be a more consistent exerciser, for years I was either exercising or writing reviews for exercise videos here.  For the past few years, not so much.  I start, stop, start again, stop again.  Hopefully one day I will find the consistency I once had, this DVD may get me on my way.

Debra Mazda, who I am new to, leads you through this step workout, part of the Shapely Girl workout DVD series.  The step workout as is runs about 45 minutes, including warm up and cooldown.  She has 4 Shapely Girls exercising along with her, one who only uses one riser, another who doesn't do any arm movements, and other who uses two risers.  The steps are pretty basic, nothing too difficult which honestly is what I prefer.  Basic steps, knee lifts, hamstring curls, L steps, over the tops are some of the steps you will see here.  Debra cues well, and the combinations aren't too long where it become repetitive and boring.  The music is good too, helped me get up and moving for sure.

She also includes a few premixes which is a nice bonus, 2 shorter step premixes which are about 30 minute each, and a longer step premix which is 56 minutes.  There is also a bonus toning workout, plus a ""Circle Time"" segment where she sits down with her Shapely Girls and they talk for a bit about their fitness journeys.

I, like Goth Hippy have about 15 step workouts.  Most of them are from the 90's and are only available on VHS, it is nice to see a newer step workout that uses the tried and true step moves, going back to the basics.  Many of the step workouts nowadays are overly complex in choreography or too high impact for my tastes. Both likely resulting in me spraining my ankles.

I would recommend this for beginner to intermediate levels, advanced would likely find this too easy.  This is perfect for me.  Debra Mazda is a good instructor and can certainly identify with those who are trying to get fit and in shape.  She says she has been there many times, and encourages you not to give up and stick with it.  She is a good motivator.  I see myself checking out her other offerings, meanwhile I will be doing this step workout often and hopefully be on the road to getting my ""shape"" back!",1296864000,,2366,4.423611111111111

3678378,5,B001L38SRW,"Really surprised how good this workout is even if you are in shape and not over weight!  It is a low impact routine that is hard enough and long enough to work up a sweat plus interesting to keep you wanting to keep with it.  Instructor is great, music is good, and instruction very clear.  No fancy moves just basic steps.  Has different mixes for various lengths.  Buy it and you will get hooked!",1281484800,2,398,4.324324324324325
3678379,5,B001L38SRW,I purchased this DVD as a start to stepping in the privacy of my home. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to any newcomer to step or for anyone who is unfit. The first week I did it with no arms then introduced the arms slowly and can now complete the whole 40min workout complete with arms. I am over 50 and unfit but feel really great using the DVD.,1280016000,6,360,4.013888888888889
3678380,4,B001L38SRW,"Debra does a tutorial on the step moves at the beginning that really help.

3678384,3,B001L38SRW,I bought this after reading all the great reviews on Amazon. It was just ok for me. It wasn't as professional looking as some others I've tried and I found the woman very annoying. She talked and talked and talked and it started to bug me to the point where I just turned off the DVD and didn't pick it up again. If you can mute it that would probably make it much easier on the ears. The workout wasn't bad but just not up to par for me.,1268438400,9,438,3.932584269662921

3678386,5,B001L38SRW,"This is my favorite step workout ever - I have a several different step workouts, from Denise Austin to Brenda Dygraff to the Buns of Steel videos, and this is by far my favorite.  For one, I like the basic movements; I'm really not a fan of complicated moves/combos (two left feet!), so keeping it simple is for me!  But just because the moves are simple doesn't mean they can't be challenging.  While I'm sure this may be boring for advanced steppers, I found this to be challenging as well as easy to follow.  Debra's cueing is perfect!

Plus, this is a 37 minute aerobic routine - my other tapes are only 20 to 25 minutes, but I like that this is longer - it helps me build up my endurance.  I did this a few times, then tried the Brenda Dygraff routine, and while it was only 20 minutes, the moves are more complicated than Debra's.  And I didn't even break a sweat!  Usually this tape kicks my butt, but not this time, thanks to doing the Shapely Girl step workout.

For beginners, she gives plenty of options to make it as easy or challenging as you like; one of her steppers does a no arm workout, which is great for people just starting step, or those of us who haven't worked out in ages.  But again, you can make this challenging by simply raising your step height, adding wrist weights, etc.  This isn't a DVD I'm going to get rid of after I attain a certain level, that's for sure! (unlike my two Denise Austin step tapes - they're very good, but mainly for beginners).

Another plus about Debra's workout DVDs are the premixes - there are two aerobic mixes in addition to the main workout, a 31 minute and a 25 minute, perfect if you're short on time, or again, if you want to start with a shorter workout and go from there.  AND there's a bonus short toning segment :)  AND one mix that combines includes aerobic and toning.  You definitely get your money's worth with Debra's DVDs!

I agree with one reviewer, in there should be a 'slow down' period in-between the aerobic and cool down segments.  Going from your target heart rate RIGHT to cool down is awkward.  It's not a problem for me, as I just pause the DVD and do the cool down once my heart rate is back to normal.

Lastly, I love Debra's attitude - she's so positive and has a very 'coffee talk' personality, which is great :D
And I also agree with another reviewer in that she knows exactly what to say to encourage you to give your all.  As challenging as this workout was to do the first time, I did it the whole way through.  Her encouragement really does make a difference.  And I actually have FUN while exercising - there's no 'dread factor', LOL.

So, in all, HIGHLY recommended!  I ordered her walking workout yesterday after reading all the glowing reviews.  I can't wait!",1267488000,9,2758,4.3713163064833
3678387,5,B001L38SRW,"I received two of Debra's dvds.  The Beginner Step Cardio is easy to follow and Debra is there to coach and motivate you every ""step"" of the way!  I would definitely recommend this dvd and know that you too will feel like Debra is your own personal coach! It's a great workout without impossible fancy footwork so know that you will actually look forward to doing it over and over.  Go for it!!",1254873600,3,394,4.36986301369863

I expected her to pass out before the routine was over.  All routines merged into each other, and I was not quite sure when the segment was over.  I will not be using the tape, and I will donate to good will.",1520208000,,389,4.514285714285714

8317092,5,B001L38SRW,I used to work out with Jane Fondas step and since that is not available on dvd I chose this one.  I like the instructor and the others ladies aren't annoying at all.  Fun music. Glad I made this choice. The only negative I could possibly see is after doing the entire routine she doesnt transition to cool down gradually. Its hard stepping then immediately to slow cool down.,1517788800,,376,4.434782608695652

8317098,5,B001L38SRW,Love this DVD! The music is fantastic and so are the routines. I don't use it for stepping though that's what I bought it for. I wasn't in as good a shape as I thought I was so I've been doing the steps on the floor and its been very effective! Very! The music and steps are so good they make me keep exercising when my body says sit down! That is no lie! Sometimes she gets off the count but so does Leslie Sansone! Mazda 's routines are so much better and original than Sansone's and I have 5 of her DVDs! Just love this one!,1498867200,,527,3.9345794392523366
