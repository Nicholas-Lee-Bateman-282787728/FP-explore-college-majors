524248,5,6302872669,"This is easily one of Benjamin's (4 years old) favorites.  He loves to imitate the giant slugs as he slowly ambles about the room, making mouth pinchers with his fingers, and croaking out the breathy the ""hooo-haaa"" sound from the movie.  Pure optimistic 50's SF where no problem can't be overcome if we just work together.  And what science can't overcome, the army can just blow up.",980812800,,384,4.701492537313433
524249,5,6302872669,"Yes, this is an oldie, but a goodie. One of the best of the 50's. If you can travel back in time to the days of 25 cent movies and 10 cent popcorn, then you would enjoy such a treat as The Monster That Challenged The World. Pitted against today's horror specials, this one holds it own. It certainly was a shocking film during the 50's and is well remembered by those brave enough to view it alone. So, on a dark evening, lock your doors and windows, get out the popcorn and cuddle up for a trip back in time and enjoy one of the best from the 50's.",969926400,9,549,4.0
524250,3,6302872669,"A well-done, enjoyable 1950s ""giant menace"" thriller.  The  documentary-like use of real locations and military procedures makes it  almost believable.  Slightly unusual for the period is the fact that the  menace (giant slugs in snail shells) are unleashed NOT by radiation, but  merely by an earthquake which rouses them from hibernation beneath the  Salton Sea.  The big slugs are portrayed by full-size mechanical mock-ups  (well, probably only one) and are more-or-less convincing.  A bit too much  time is spent on the romantic sub-plot.  Worth seeing.",968025600,5,558,5.435294117647059

524260,5,6302872669,"""It! The Terror From Beyond Space"" is one of my most favored classic Sci-Fi movies of all time, it was also the very first DVD I ever bought when DVDs first came out. As a kid growing up watching the late night horror creature feature on TV (the Sammy Terry Show--I think it was broadcast out of Indianapolis?) I saw so many of these wonderful Sci-fi gems, and this one is a really good one. It was has a great story line; yes, the monster costume is quite cheesy, but you have to look beyond that and the low-budget set. The acting isn't that bad either. You'll notice that this movie is all about what's happening inside the ship and not out. There isn't a whole lot of ""special effects"" for the typical Hollywood B-movie space/Mars movie, which is one of the reasons why I like this film so much. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this movie was the inspiration for Ridley Scott's 1979 mega hit ""Alien"" starring Tom Skerritt and Sigourney Weaver. Same premise. If you've never seen it, and are a new-comer to the classic monster & Sci-Fi movies, then give this one a try. Like I said, you have to look beyond some things...like exploding hand grenades and firing a bazooka on board the ship!!! (that is hilarious by the way, but reserve your judgement for the content of the film) It's a great film and a joy to watch (I've watched it thousands of times (yes, really))",1509321600,,1376,4.421259842519685
524261,5,6302872669,"I have both of these on VHS and they still work well.  So this is more a back up copy for now but its a very good buy of some vintage 50's sci fi!.  Now after watching these to movies here's something to ponder. I'll bet you'll never look at escargot the same way after watching the monster that challenged the world { Hans Conried is great in this! { AKA Snidley Whiplash from old Duddley Doo Right cartoons} And what happened to our space program? According to It came from beyond space by !973 we should've already been landing men and women on Mars!

524263,4,6302872669,"Actually, the monster that challenged Southern California. Well, challenged the Salton Sea. To be more accurate, challenged a small portion of a beach on the Salton Sea. So not really world-challenging. Something like ""The Monster That Annoyed the Locals"". A doughy naval officer steam-cleans a big snail.
As for ""It"", my guess is Ridley Scott might have seen this long ago when he conceived ""Alien"". Open the airlock...",1507593600,3,420,5.1911764705882355

524268,4,6302872669,"We get the classic 50's sci-fi introductory narration, a story of how the Salton Sea (southern California) was formed, and the possibility that giant creatures may have lived there at one time.

Then we switch to present day laboratory where they measure an earth quake. Mean while the navy is experimenting with Parachutes over the Salton Sea. The tester lands on the water and before the retrieval crew can get there he disappears. Looks like the retrieval crew is about to disappear.

From here all the standard situation to a creature/s unknown threaten to wipe out mankind. Don't let the thread distract from the parallel falling in love story between John (Tim Holt) and Gail (Audrey Dalton).

One of the redeeming features of this movie is the rebellious teenager that does not listen to her mother and gets sucked dry.

One disappointment is that with all the devices at their disposal they did not use a flamethrower.

The Monster/s looked like they took the old Japanese ""Rodan"" caterpillar and gave it a snail shell.

An added plus is noticing that they packed this film with many popular ""B"" actors come from old Charlie Chan movies. And the head scientist is Hans Conried the voice of Snidely Whiplash in ""The Bullwinkle Show"" (1961)",1504569600,,1246,4.85377358490566

524301,5,6302872669,"Many people believe that the movie Alien by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney Weaver was an original production based on brand new ideas, but, as soon as you see this movie you will realize that is not true. (which Scott has readily acknowledged)

Without giving any spoilers away, the movie is about a second spacecraft sent to Mars in 1973 to rescue the lone survivor of the first mission, Colonel Carruthers, whose ship apparently crashed. The crew of the second spaceship strongly believes that the Carruthers murdered the rest of the crew of the first ship so that his supplies would last longer. Carruthers insists that a humanoid creature attacked his crew. As the second ship begins its return flight to Earth, strange sounds and things begin to happen on the ship. Eventually the crew realize that the same creature has stowed away aboard their ship and they must figure out some manner in which to neutralize it.

While the movie originally started out as a 'B' type film, it is easy to see why that designation is not correct. It has all the hallmarks of a good film with only the budget of the film as its limitation. I enjoyed watching the film with my six year old son because I did not want him at that age to see overt bloodshed, cussing, sex or graphic violence.

524319,4,6302872669,"This review is for the blu-ray version that came out in 2015-16.

The blu-ray transfer by Kino-Lorber is very good, though the DVD itself is not necessarily a better value than the previous release which came with another very good movie, ""It, the Terror from Outer Space"", which was part of the MGM Midnite Movies Collection. Almost all of the MGM Midnite Movies have good prints, even in standard definition.

Overall, the acting is very good. The movie stars Tim Holt who was a former star of 'western' movies. He was coming back after not making movies for years and his career declined after this movie.

The story is basically about an ancient species of mollusk that comes to life after an earthquake unearths their eggs in the Salton Sea. These ancient snails hatch and start attacking people, usually but sucking the bodily fluids out of them. They don't really challenge the world, however the title is explained away from an explanation by a scientist in the movie. He claims that if they are allowed to leave the Salton Sea and get into the canal system then they can spread and kill everything in the sea and on earth. Basically, the movie comes down to the Navy trying to hem the creatures in and destroy them.

The story works fairly well and there is not much in the movie that is completely preposterous. The creatures themselves look very good, which is not always the case in these 50's movies. If not for the herky jerky movements it almost looks life like.

Recommended for fans of old sci-fi movies. This is one of the better 'big bug' movies of the 50's even if the creatures aren't bugs!",1459123200,,1611,4.618881118881119

I'll be 67 in 19... woops... ...in 2016. I suppose I'll not get used to writing
a year of 2 0_ _, until it's 2020... I guess.
I like this old stuff. Reminds me of when I was 10, and could watch a
triple feature for 50-cents.
The horror movies from the '50s... like this one... HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL...
THE TINGLER... THEM!... and any movie with the word ""IT!"" in it used to
make my skin crawl.
This movie is showing its age... with a brief, occasional, splice. It's obvious
that someone put as much loving care---as possible---getting together the
best existing film elements to rekindle memories of my past.

524340,5,6302872669,"Just finished watching ""The Monster That Challenged The World"" released by United Artists.
I strongly suspect that Steven Spielberg and James Cameron saw this movie as young boys.  ""Jaws"" steals a few scenes from this rather gripping science fiction movie that was first released in 1957.  So does Cameron's ""Aliens"" when a terrified mother tells her daughter to ""close your eyes."" as the monster tries to batter its way into the janitor's closet where they barricaded themselves in after a narrow escape.
The plot is rather simple:  an earthquake under the Salton Sea unearths a horrifying nest of prehistoric killer crustaceans that eat anything edible in their path - including humans.
While the concept of giant snails preying on a terrified humanity may elicit a snicker or two; ""The Monster That Challenged The World"" is a classic B-movie thriller that keeps up the tension and never lets it drop until the heroine and her young daughter are reunited with the brave Navy Commander who saved them.
Great B-Movie Fun!
A Must-See for all fans of giant creature movies and classic B-movie science films!
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1447200000,2,1137,5.06951871657754
524341,4,6302872669,"I got this because I was reading a documentary book on Star Trek and there was a mention that ""it played like an episode of Star Trek"" (this is TOS we're talking about). And it was one of the very few SF movies from, you know, a lifetime ago that for whatever reason I had just never watched.

Well, it kind of, sort of, plays like an episode of TOS. But not really. Using that comparison, no attempts are made to communicate with the monster. Which would be the TOS way, at least in part. This is basically a monster loose on a spaceship movie, and our heroes have to kill it before it kills them.

With that said, it really is not bad at all for the time, and the kind of movie it is. And it, in a weird sort of way, does have some vague feeling of a TOS episode... maybe a not so good one, but yeah, I can see where the comparison is somewhat valid.

Make no mistake, this is essentially a monster on the loose movie. Lots of tension, lots of excitement, and a well done one at that. Think more of the original _The Thing_ (although IMHO that one was a bit better) than a TOS episode, and you'll be close. Also the element of a monster loose on a spaceship, predating the film Alien by decades. There are a few vague similarities there too.

The monster itself it strictly out of something like The Outer Limits; a guy in a rubber monster suit. Although for it's time the SFX are quite acceptable, don't be expecting more than that.

However, I'm quite able, having grown up with such fair, that I can enjoy it despite what today would be considered ""flaws"". For a decent monster yarn, I'm glad I got it. Your millage, of course, may very well vary. I'm sure I'll watch it again and again over the coming years... just not that often. Sometimes a decent monster yarn is just what I need to relax, and for that this one fits the bill.",1447113600,,1836,4.204545454545454

thriller with a black-and-white image which intensifies the backround and mood.  Tim Holt is reasonably effective in the title role as a somewhat
erious Navy officer who becomes humanized by a pretty widow with an infectious young daughter.  Aside from being slightly heavy in appearance, Holt's performance is right on target!  He balances command authority and degrees of sensitivity quyite nicely.  Audrey Dalton is a touching and

524443,5,6302872669,"THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD...
THE STORY (contains spoilers): TMTCTW is a little-known and tragically under-appreciated gem of a film. 1940's Cowboy star Tim Holt portrays Cmdr. John Twillinger, (""Twill"" to his friends), the no-nonsense, newly-appointed Head of Operations at the United States Navy's Salton Sea Research Facility. Shortly before his arrival, a small earthquake occurred in the area, opening a fissure in the floor of the Salton Sea. The inrush of warm, slightly radioactive water into the caverns below awakens dozens of long-dormant, prehistoric snails. The slimy creatures eventually escape from their subterranean prison and begin foraging on everything in sight, growing into slimy giants. Unfortunately for the newly-appointed Twillenger and his men, that feeding frenzy soon includes an unlucky Navy parachute tester and two wet-behind-the-ears sailors in charge of taking a small boat out to recover the test jumpers. The always fun Hans Conried co-stars as Dr. Jess Rogers, the irritable scientist who's tasked by Twillenger with figuring out just what in the heck is going on. Initially, Holt & Conried's characters are at odds with each other when the threat first appears and Twillenger starts demanding answers but fast. Forced to work together in order to solve the rapidly developing crisis, the two men eventually establish a mutual respect (and even a friendship of sorts) when things really begin to unravel, and it becomes glaringly apparent that the goings-on in & around the Salton Sea are anything but normal.

THOUGHTS (contains spoilers): This film is another of those sci-fi/horror sub-genre 'Big Bug' films, like ""Them!,"" ""The Deadly Mantis,"" ""Beginning of the End,"" ""Tarantula"", etc., and while I will grant you that it isn't a movie that's going to change your life or anything, I want to stress just how much this wonderfully quirky little film has going for it. What struck me the very first time I watched TMTCTW was the wealth of unusual, against-type characters that, from lead role to bit part, were so wonderfully written and realized by some perfectly-cast actors. Max Showalter (a.k.a. Casey Adams) who starred as Lt. Dick Chasen(!) in ""The Indestructible Man"" and played 'Grandpa Fred' in ""16 Candles"" has a small part as one of Hans Conried's assistants. Creepy-looking bit player Milton Parsons is a hoot as Lewis Clark Dobbs, the eccentric (and more than a little eerie) caretaker of the local area museum & archives. He is a riot, stealing every scene he's in, and he's just one of the reasons this movie is so memorable. (I think Parsons would have been a perfect fit as a member of TV's Addams Family.) There's also an amusing scene with the local coroner; a man who keeps his lunch handy (and fresh) by storing it under a sheet in one of the refrigerated drawers in the morgue! Now coroners with a morbid sense of humor have long been a staple on TV crime shows and in the movies, but TMTCTW features the earliest depiction I've seen of that character type.

Lead actor Tim Holt is perhaps most famously known for his supporting roles in great films like ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" ""Swiss Family Robinson"" and ""Stagecoach."" But did you know he also starred in his own series of RKO-produced ""B"" westerns in the 1940's thru the early 1950's, making almost 50 of these modest-budgeted ""oaters"" before retiring!? Holt is enshrined in the Western Performers Hall of Fame as the third highest-grossing cowboy star of all time AND he holds the unique distinction of being Hollywood's fastest on-screen gun. Very cool. And did you also know that he was a decorated WWII hero? He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, and Purple Heart, among them. Holt eventually walked away from the business in 1952, disillusioned. After a five year absence, he briefly came out of his self-imposed retirement to star in THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD and two other small films before retiring permanently. Sadly, he died from bone cancer in 1973 at the too young age of 54.

Holt is really terrific here. He initially comes across as a gruff, posturing, blowhard tin-soldier type, but as the film progresses we discover that he is, in fact, a gentle and genuinely caring man who does the best he can when thrown into the midst of an unthinkably nightmarish situation. His fine performance here inspired me to track down and purchase all 4 volumes of his B-westerns, offered thru the W-B Archive Collection (and also here on Amazon). Each 5-disc volume features 9-10 movies. Great stuff if you love westerns and/or old movies. Holt makes an awesomely NON-typical leading man; he's short, chunky and fairly soft-spoken. Basically nothing at all like the strapping, stalwart types who usually played leads in this sort of film (Kenneth Tobey, John Agar, Richard Carlson, et. al.). There's a great little scene between Twill and his love interest, Gail; played sweetly (if a little woodenly) by Audrey Dalton. Twillenger is working late into the night at the hastily set up joint command center, where both military & local law enforcement are working to locate & destroy the creatures. He's in the middle of polishing off a sandwich & chips when Gail (Dalton) calls. She tells him she'd like to accept his earlier invitation to dinner - IF he's still interested. A tired Holt perks up immediately at this and Gail asks if he's eaten yet. Twill quickly responds ""Why, errr... no, I'm starved!"" He then notices the half-eaten sandwich still in his hand and quickly dumps it back onto the plate, as if Gail can somehow see him and knows he's lying. It's a small, cute moment, but it nicely showcases just what a talented actor the man was.

Holt also plays nicely against type again during the film's hair-raising climax, where he must single-handedly battle one of the monsters. One of the prehistoric egg sacks, brought back to the base laboratory at the beginning of the picture, accidentally hatches and the hungry monster attacks Gail and her young daughter, Sandy. Cut off from the lab's exit, Gail attempts to hide from the creature but finds herself trapped in the lab's tiny storage room with her terrified daughter. This scene is a powerful one; the mother, believing that no one else knows they're in the lab (and that they'll soon be eaten) clutches her daughter tight, telling little Sandy to ""keep {her} eyes closed for a little while - no matter what."" She tries to sooth the hysterical girl, rocking her as the hungry monstrosity methodically chews its way through the flimsy closet door. When Twill stumbles into the lab and is confronted by the hideous 15 foot killer crustacean he reacts like any average guy REALLY would. Does he snatch up the ax hanging on the wall, puff his chest out and leap onto the monster's back like Tarzan?? Hell no! He very wisely stays as far away from the slimy thing as possible, still doing whatever he can to distract it from the woman & her child. Throwing jars full of chemicals and anything else that isn't nailed down at the massive mollusk. When he runs out of beakers & bottles he grabs a fire extinguisher, spraying it into the thing's eyes to blind it. When that's emptied, he wrenches a steam hose loose from its fitting and aims it at the monster. Scalded by the superheated steam, the cooked Kraken recoils in agony and starts blindly destroying the lab. The look of utter horror on Holt's pudgy, sweat-soaked face displays the genuine terror that any average person would truly feel if they were trapped in a room with a huge, man-eating monstrosity. Thankfully, he's able to keep the beast at bay with the improvised steam cooker until the MP's show up. When they do, Holt doesn't grab one of their rifles and open fire like Rambo, he gets the hell out of their way and lets the soldiers do their job, riddling the berserk behemoth with gunfire until it collapses, dead, to the floor.

The Salton Sea location was a nice change of pace from the usual urban setting that these films often had; a breath of fresh salty air. The title creature is a wonderfully-realized full-size animatronic prop with a suitably grotesque appearance, complete with bulging gelatinous eyes, goo-dripping pincers and grappling feet/fingers/feelers. There are a couple of shockingly gruesome (for the time) death scenes, which still manage to pack a jolt. The writing is quite good, especially for this kind of film. Sure there's some stiff dialogue, but everything is so out of the ordinary compared to other sci-fi (and especially giant insect) films of the period that it makes up for it - and then some. Good all-around performances from the supporting cast add real punch to the script, with wonderfully quirky characters peppered throughout the screenplay: the HQ switchboard operator who is always gossiping to her mother, the local sheriff who surprisingly doesn't bristle at the military's being in charge but instead wisely does all he can to coordinate with the Navy to bring a swift end to the threat of the monsters, the coroner & the flaky museum curator I mentioned earlier. Just all around pitch-perfect stuff here. THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD is one of the best of the Big Bug Films and easily one of my all-time favorite sci-fi/horror films, from this or any period in motion picture history.

IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE...
THOUGHTS: Another fantastic little film which almost certainly informed Dan O'Bannon's script for ALIEN, (as did PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, which is also available as part of MGM's Midnight Movie collection). IT! was the original, and it still has the basic tension to keep you hooked. The film's brief 68 minute running time means you won't be checking your watch too often. The script is tight and moves along briskly to the heroic climax. The monster, designed & constructed by low-budget legend Paul Blasdell, is obviously a guy in a suit, but It still manages to be quite effective. The spaceship's interior sets and the miniature rocket prop itself are painfully low-budget stuff, but then that's a big part of the charm of these old films. The core story is what grabs you and that's why it still worked so well some 20 years later, when Ridley Scott was given a chance to retell the same basic story, with a much bigger budget.

The acting in IT! is mainly of the wooden variety, but the filmmakers likely put this entire movie in the can in less than 10 days, so in-depth discussions with the actors about their characters' histories & motivations probably didn't happen. The various actors were given the concept for the film's plot, agreed to do the movie, learned their lines and then delivered them while hitting their required marks and... Cut! Print! That's a wrap! When you think about it, this is one of those films that actually succeeds DESPITE its paltry budget. A good core concept with steadily mounting tension, a few genuine scares, a clever resolution and a cool-looking creature have kept this from flick from dropping off the radar over the ensuing decades. I prefer this film over a lot of better-made sci-fi from the same (and later) eras, despite the high school play-level sets, obvious rubber suit monster & super-imposed rocketship cut out. I'd certainly rather watch IT! or TMTCTW than the soul-less, computer-generated creature features & tasteless splatter-horror/torture porn gunk that clogs today's cineplexes.

The audio & video quality of this double DVD is pretty solid. (The moody lighting for IT! is especially nice.) The mono sound is decent, with only minor hiss & crackling. In fact, I only have a couple of negative comments regarding this MGM double feature. 1) The aspect ratios are, I believe, wrong for both films. The versions for this disc are 4:3 cropped ""pan & scan"" which is a bummer. 2) This release is on one of those wonky ""flipper"" discs. I've personally never had any issues with the several flipper discs I own (thankfully), but others have reported playability problems. I don't think this would be as much of an issue nowadays with the current generation of DVD & Blu-ray players, but older players could be problematic so Buyer Beware. The good news is that if you have concerns about these flipper discs over time, these two terrific films can also be purchased separately. (AND BOTH ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN SUPERIOR BLU-RAY FORMAT!) 5 solid STARS for this winning combination of old school sci-fi shockers! :-)",1394928000,9,12510,4.922785409758409

Of the two movies in this DVD, only It! The Terror from Beyond Space could be played. The other movie, The Monster That Challenged the World could not be seen. When the disk was flipped to watch it, two different players gave the same message: this disk cannot be played.

I am giving it two stars because the movie that could be watched, It! The Terror from Beyond Space, was quite good. The acting was believable (although chauvinistic, with the female characters ostensibly performing domestic duties in the ship), the special effects were acceptable for the time they were made, the creature design and portrayal was really convincing, and the plot was engaging, tense, sometimes scary and never lagging or dull. The sets look dated, especially the instruments and control panels, but in my opinion that adds to the charm of an old production.

Too bad I could not see The Monster That Challenged the World. If it is as enjoyable as most reviewers here state, then I would probably have given this product a four stars rating.",1392249600,3,1150,4.655172413793103

It was a pleasure to watch it again, and just smile at the rubber feet and hands of the monster.  But the concept was ahead of its time -  a monster from another world that actively hunts and eats humans, all while trapped in a spaceship.  You just have to ignore the poor science of the time, for example, the spacesuits, and the interior of the craft. But modern films, like Alien, and Aliens, used this concept successfully and went on to be great hits.  Another on my favorite list is, The Thing.

524474,4,6302872669,"Although the two movies on the ""Monster That Challenged the World/ It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" split DVD are hardly film masterpieces, I had a good time watching both of them. I bought the DVD to own a copy of ""The Monster that Challenged the World"" but I have also watched and enjoyed ""It!"" I think the DVD is a good buy, and I wouldn't be amazed if the price increases (it can't go much lower than it is priced as I type this capsule review).

  I may as well be up front about the fact that I was a great fan of horror and science-fiction movies from at least the time I was five years old, and if a movie had a monster of any sort in it when I was younger, I felt I had to see it. I am still fond of ""monster movies"" today but I find that since the early eighties I have been entertained less and less by the genre, not because I have finally matured but because the films themselves have changed in ways I don't care for (I believe ""Lake Placid"" was the last film of the genre which I saw in a movie theater and enjoyed whole-heartedly). I have seen both of the movies on television at one time or another, but I had only seen ""Monster That Challenged the World"" twice (once in 1965 and once in 2004) and ""It!"" once (in 2004) before I bought this economically priced DVD.

  There is very little about ""Monster That Challenged the World"" that I don't like. It has an unusual setting (the Salton Sea of California), a good script, a fine cast (especially Hans Conreid), a well thought out menace, a great monster design, a few suspenseful moments, an exciting climax, and even a humorous dig at petty local politics. Monster also has a nice pace to it which makes it seem to go by quicker than its actually running time, but it doesn't seem rushed either. I would have loved to have seen the movie in a theater when I was ten years old, and I'm still able to appreciate the fact that it would have been right up my alley. I'll probably watch it once or twice a year for a long while to come.

  I know that quite a few people think that ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" may have been the inspiration for ""Alien"" but I have yet to see anything that suggests that both may have sprung from a novelette by A.E. Van Vogt titled ""Destroyer"" which is about an alien life form which has accidentally or intentionally stowed away on a spaceship and is slowly killing off the crew. The creature in the Van Vogt story is distinctly feline instead of being anything like the ""lizard-man"" in ""It!"" but I think there is quite a bit of the Van Vogt story incorporated into ""It!"" (and maybe just a trace of the idea in ""Alien"" as well). I think that ""It!"" has not aged nearly as well as ""Monster That Challenged the World"" mainly because of the poor design of the creature costume and its depiction of the interior of the spaceship and almost all of the visual components of the film seem ""camp"" because, while they were consistent with the then contemporary idea of what spaceships would be like, the visuals now seem quaint. That should undermine the movie more than it does, but for all the dated effects and the improbabilities of the script, ""It!"" still manages to convey a bit of danger and more than a little fatalism; the movie still works pretty well despite its flaws. The ending stands up just fine and is rather satisfying. I'm sure I will watch the movie again at some point in the near future.

 So, to recap, both films are decidedly old school, very old school, but both are greater than the sum of their parts. I gave them four out of five stars because they aren't great movies, and I gave them four stars instead of three because they are both better than other movies of their kind from the same era. The only thing I regret about buying the double feature DVD is that it makes me acutely  regret that I've never seen either film on a real movie screen and will probably never have the chance to do so.",1375488000,3,3919,4.2953929539295395
524475,4,6302872669,"I watched the first movie when I was a child, The Monster that Challenged the World and the monster made an impression on me. It looked real & was scary.

I do wonder why all these movies always had some dopey kid in it, who no matter how charming they were, would get "" curious "" and screw things up. You see it in this movie & a dumb adult screws things up in the same way in Reptilicus.

I hadn't seen the second movie before but the monster was relentless & we've seen this kind of plot done in dozens of sf movies since.

Even so, it was a good film & interesting to watch.

I'd rather watch even a BAD sf movie from the 1950s than some of the crappy cgi garbage they try to foist off on the movie going public today.

When a second rocketship arrives from Earth, Caruthers is brought aboard and is to be taken to Earth to faces murder charges.  While on Mars, an alien creature sneaks aboard the rocketship, and once in space, it begins to attack and kill the crew, and soon a full scale battle for survival is underway.

Shot in black and white, and running about 68 minutes, the movie sets a tone early, and then mostly focuses on the central storyline, without too many sidebars.  The suspense picks up, and it is not long before the creature appears, growing and raising hell.  They are not the brightest group around, but in a desperate situation, the crew works together pretty well, battling against a very tough and nasty opponent.

The special effects are sometimes elementary, and the monster is just a guy in a suit, but there are still some pretty decent looking sets, and effectively exciting  scenes.  Although the acting is a bit stiff, fans of the genre should appreciate the straight ahead presentation, which is similar in style to classic pulp science fiction.

It relieves me of the trouble it takes to search through my DVD library for movies to pair together.  I like the convenience of that.  It also helped that, in this case, I just happen to love both of the proffered choices.

The Monster that Challenged the World (theres a title begging to be pared down!), begins as most of these types of movies do, with an earthquake that releases this prehistoric problem from the bottom of the Salton Sea.  Naturally, it goes on an immediate feeding frenzy leaving behind shriveled corpses, all their vital juices having been sucked dry.  Enter a sourpuss commander (Tim Holt) who likes to throw around his considerable weight while barking orders at everyone.  His challenge is to find the giant mollusk and make it stop.  Unfortunately, complications arise when its proven theres more than one of these suckers on the loose.
Favorite actor in the thankless role of a know-it-all scientist, Hans Conried.
As monster movies go, this one is pretty good.

The second feature, also sporting an unfortunately long title, is IT!  The Terror From Beyond Space.  (Odd, considering they know IT comes from Mars and not beyond.)  Its a sad tale of a man wrongfully accused of killing his entire crew for food.  I should clarify, killing them for their food rations, not that he was planning to eat them.  Although.........
This poor unfortunate man (a stoic Marshall Thompson) is tracked down and caught (off screen).  The action takes place on the rocket bringing them home.  The hitch is the hitchhiker that stowed away below decks: an extremely hungry Martian.  Long trip, available snacks........well, someone had to feed it.
This is always a good premise and this movie handles it well (even if the Martian is a bit on the rubbery side of fake rather than fantastic).

3/5

A surprisingly intelligent monster movie where giant, prehistoric vampire snails threaten to overrun the world after being freed by an earthquake.

On the plus side, the monsters look fantastic and convey a genuine sense of menace.  Also on the plus side, the romantic subplot between the films hero and leading lady is surprisingly well done with both characters being well developed and the attraction between them seeming believable.

On the down side, as good as it is, the romantic subplot, combined with the military planning scenes, take WAY too much time away from the monsters.  The awesome monsters in question get two great scenes (with the climax being especially impressive) but, imho, they should have gotten more screentime.  Its a shame, too, as a little better pacing and some more monster action would've made this one a classic.  The monsters were seriously that good!

IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE

5/5

A lone astronaut, suspected of killing his entire crew, is being escorted back to earth by ANOTHER crew on their spaceship.  He claims something else killed his crew, they don't believe him at first, but that his ""something else"" happens to be a big, killer, seemingly indestructible alien that just so happens to have snuck on board before liftoff.  It starts picking off crew members one by one while the remaining ones are slowly trapped higher and higher in the ship as it makes its advance.

This movie was darn impressive, its in B&W and uses heavy light and shadow to create great atmosphere.  Its also a short movie with a plot that gets going quick and does not let up one bit along the way.  There are some schocky moments (some dumb decisions by certain crew, as well the odd inventory on the ship that includes tons of hand grenades and bottles of blood) but the tight, intense pacing and some genuine scare moments make it an extremely entertaining movie for anyone who likes 50's sci-fi.",1354233600,2,1974,4.847761194029851

Western hero Tim Holt gives up the reins and takes up a diving suit as an investigative officer with Naval Intelligence, one who suddenly has several dead bodies to investigate as well as a strange gooey substance smeared all over the scene of the crime.  Turns out an earthquake in the Salton Sea has reawakened a prehistoric strain of mollusks, and if their nest isn't discovered in time, they just may become the dominant life form on Earth.

Okay...well, really, this one had its moments.  My kids are pretty sheltered, so when my nine-year-old wants to stay up late on a Saturday night and watch scary movies, this is the sort of thing I turn to.  Fortunately, I don't mind too much, and I'd call this one about average for a creature feature from the fifties.  It's formulaic though - Holt as the heavy, Hans Conried as the scientist to explain what's going on to the heavy, and pretty Audrey Dalton to do some heavy screaming when the time is right.  Throw in bug-eyed prolific character actor Max Showalter and you've got a solid cast chasing after...giant mollusks.

If you like these sorts of films, then you won't be disappointed, but neither is it going to change your mind if you don't.  A couple of nice scenes designed to startle, and another that looks a lot like the opening scene from JAWS - so much so, you have to wonder if Spielberg didn't see this film as a youngster in the theater.  My biggest problem with the film is that it seemed to drag in spots - perhaps a little tighter editing and, even with its silly premise, you may have had a classic of the genre in the vein of THEM.  (I guess giant ants are just as silly as giant snails, but I always thought THEM was about tops as far as creature features go.)

My suggestion?  Watch it with a nine-year-old.  Fun for you and for them.",1336176000,,1853,4.427728613569322
524504,5,6302872669,"Years ago I saw these two great B/W 1050s ""B"" movies on TV about 5 times each. They were great.

They did a great job putting them on DVD. The B/W pictures were clear and the audio was great.

The Monster That Challenged The World is about giant slug like mollusks that are radiated by radiation from nuclear tests and are let lose by an earthquake from under a salty inland sea. We see the scientists discovering them underwater and numerous people getting killed as the creatures feed sucking the life fluids from the bodies in their mandible/pincers. The special effects were very good for  a 1950s ""B"" rated movie. The caterpillar like mollusk looked cool with its  two eyes and mandibles...not phony. The worry the Navy and scientists have is that these creatures will escape into the canal system and lay thousands of eggs and take over the world. A good plot, acting and ending. I enjoyed this movie. 5 stars

It The Terror From Beyond Outer Space was another 1950s B/W ""B"" rated film. I like any books or movies about Mars. They all helped me develop into a 40 plus year amateur astronomer and life member of the Mars Society.

The DVD was great. The B/W movie was clear with good audio. Great plot, acting and great ending. The first spaceship crashes on Mars and 9 people are stranded. Only one, Colonel Carruthers the captain of the ship survives. Another spaceship arrives months later to pick up survivors. Col. Carruthers is to be Court Marshaled on earth for murder of the crew as a human skull with a bullet hole of a member of the first exposition is found by a member of the second exposition. Col Carruthers tells the crew of the second expedition he did not kill anyone. It was some kind of creature in a sandstorm. No one believes him.

Unfortunately  for the second crew, the IT creature sneaks aboard the second spacecraft shortly before liftoff. It starts killing crew members and draining their body fluids...all moisture. The big ugly creature looks cool in the full body rubber suit although The Creature From The Black Lagoon (see my review) looked better. The crew fights back with hand grenades, pistols, rifles, electrocution and trapping it in a nuclear reactor room and flooding the room with radiation enough to kill 100 men. Nothing will stop IT as it goes crazy and keeps killing more and more of the crew. I won't ruin the great ending for you except to say the few survivors radio back to Earth another name for Mars is DEATH and possibly should be avoided. Great classic Sci Fi movie and INMO one of the top 5 ""B"" rated B/W science fiction movies of all time. Rated 5 stars. Entire DVD 5 stars.",1326412800,3,2633,4.587234042553192

Instead, the monster turned out to be smallish and rather tame by Sci Fi standards, easily dealt with, and at no time a real threat to the world, or even a city.

Look for the following essential 50's plot points:

Radioactivity. Yay!
A young female asserting her rights to individualism (boo! Hiss!) who gets summarily eaten.
A small child who unleashes horror in a laboratory, because of her fascination with bunnies.
A heroic lead who gets the girl in the end. Yay!

As we left the theater, I told her that though I knew it was impossible, I could swear I had somehow seen ""Alien"" before even though we had just viewed it on it's debut weekend. Some time later, someone who knew I was a sci-fi fan presented me with a copy of the book ""Science Fictionary."" As I read the book (which was basically an alphabetical listing of sci-fi film plots with the author's opinions added) I came to the entry for ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space"" and my suspicions about ""Alien"" were finally vindicated. Indeed, even the book's author asserted the obvious ""uncredited"" remake of ""It!"" that ""Alien"" was. Alien gets on board ship undetected. Alien uses air ducts to move around ship. No effective weapons on board to fight almost invulnerable alien. Alien finally killed by opening ship up to vacuum of space. Same movie, except that ""It!"" did it first and did it better without the benefit of exploding abdomens and slimy decapitated androids.

As for ""The Monster That Challenged The World,"" as a kid seeing it on the big screen, I was scared out of my seat several times during the film! The scene where the monster comes up behind the old gatekeeper (played by the same guy who was Arnold the pig's owner on Green Acres) and inserts it's pincer-like fangs into the old man's neck to suck the life out of him had me shivering and feeling goosebumps on the back of my neck for weeks afterwards! Considering it's obvious low budget as well as the era when it was made, the film managed a good plot and plenty of suspense.

A naval scientist predicts, that unless all of these nasty proliferate creatures and their eggs are destroyed, they will devastate the world.

Unfortunately, the plodding story, the predictable scenes, and the stretched-out script will make it a challenge for you to remain seated for the entire movie.

'It! The Terror From Beyond Space' (4)  -  Sometime ago, the first expedition to Mars was about to make planetfall when all communication was lost - permanently.  Earth sent a rescue mission, which landed next to their wreck; they find only one survivor: Colonel Carruthers.  He explained that the others were lost in a sand storm, but then he offered some wild tale about a menacing dark shape in the cold swirling dust that began picking them off one-by-one.  Of course, the rescue team searched the area and turned up nothing, until one of the crew found a bullet-pierced skull; and now they suspect that Carruthers had killed his ship mates.  He will be taken back to Earth to be tried for murder.

Unfortunately for the rescue crew, as they are preparing for take off, a Martian climbs aboard through an open air lock.  It may be intelligent or just a beast, but one thing becomes quiet clear: it's blood-thirsty ...

This is an above average film of its kind; the cheap sets and the man in the monster suit do not prevent enjoyment.  If you are a star gazer, you will be surprised to find recognizable star constellations in the background of the flying spaceship.

  I will admit that there are quite a few classic movies that are incrediably cheesy but for every one of them there are three others that are so good you want to watch again and again. Here are two of them.
  It the Terror from Beyond Space has been cited as the basis for the hit movie ALIEN and we all know how well that one did. This movie is a wonderful blend of characters and situations that pull you in and hold you right until the credits roll. The acting was great, the use of music was well timed without being overwhelming, and the monster was well constructed and quite believable since they used shadows and black lights to assist in keeping the audience from getting an especially good detailed look at it. Remember it is often what we can't see that scares us most.
  The Moster that Challenged the World while not being quite up the level of it's DVD companion is nevertheless one of the brighter gems in the monster movie genre. Rarely seen played on tv nowadays it was wonderful to see it paired on this DVD. The story is good, almost all the actors' characters work smoothly together, and the mosters are one of the more well designed non-humaniod menances to come out of this time.

'The Monster That Challenged The World' features some unusually grisly corpses, an unusually grisly Tim Holt, Hans Conried in a rare serious role, an unusual locale, some pretty impressive monsters, an eyeball-popping scene, doomed lovers going off for a swim, and an absolutely hilarious hidden joke in the final confrontation.  It's pure fun, not least because you get to see the evil Dr. Terwilliker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-5-000-Fingers-of-Dr-T/dp/B000059H74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T</a>) as a good-guy scientist dealing with prehistoric snails that ooze disgusting slime. (Is it... ATOMIC?!?)

'It!  The Terror From Beyond Space' is a good, solid sci-fi thriller, with Daktari himself, Marshall Thompson, being falsely accused of murdering his fellow astronauts on a mission to Mars.  It were a monster that done it, of course, played by Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan encased in a great rubber suit.  The scenes where the monster is inexorably making its deadly way up through the ship, clawing through bulkheads and hatches to get at the terrified crew, are still effective.  This movie also features a very funny ending, although in this case it's purely accidental.

It's been mentioned several times in these reviews that this was the inspiration for Ridley Scott's 'Alien,' written by the late Dan O'Bannon.  This is only half-true.  'Alien' is based on TWO movies: this one, and Mario Bava's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Vampires/dp/B00005K3OF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Vampires</a>.  The first half of 'Alien' is from 'Vampires' -- the creepy atmosphere, the discovery of the derelict crashed spacecraft, the huge dead alien skeleton found inside.  The rest of the movie is based on 'It!,' with the unstoppable monster hitchhiker picking off the crew one by one.

This is a great price for two extremely entertaining films.

****** BELOW THERE BE SPOILERS!!! *******

Okay, I've got to tell you about how these movies end.

It's an odd fact that quite a few fifties monsters were dispatched with a CO2 fire extinguisher.  It was apparently the weapon of choice when fighting mutant alien hellspawn.  In 'Monster That Challenged The World,' our hero has to fight a nasty seven-foot tall snail/caterpillar.  He strides into the room, looks around, completely ignores the HUGE FRIGGIN' FIRE AXE ON THE WALL, and grabs the CO2 fire extinguisher mounted RIGHT BESIDE IT.  During much of the fight, that big axe is displayed prominently in the background.  The people that made this movie weren't dummies; the acting, direction and script are all quite intelligent.  It had to be deliberate.

On the other hand, the ending of 'It!  The Terror From Beyond Space' is funny for an entirely different reason.  In what is probably the worst engineering decision in the history of spaceflight, there is a big button on the bridge with no protective cage around it.  Even though it's a black and white movie, you just know it's bright red.  This button, which could easily be accidentally pressed by someone setting down a cup of coffee or leaning over to put the moves on the pretty female scientist, activates a hatch that opens directly into space.  Not an airlock.  Space.  ON THE BRIDGE.

Its only possible use, which it admittedly performs well, is to vacuum horrible man-eating critters into the void while everyone hangs on for dear life.  Still, how often does a situation like that come up?  That button is a huge class-action suit just waiting to happen.  Maybe it was some kind of bizarre last-ditch firefighting measure.  But that's what CO2 fire extinguishers are for.  That and killing monsters.  Say...

This is, of course, how Ripley gets rid of her unwanted passenger in 'Alien,' first by venting various gasses on it (I have to check if she uses CO2) and then hitting a button to suck it directly into space while she hangs on for dear life, but there were some safety measures in place, and besides, we were all distracted by her underwear.",1267142400,5,4219,5.288721804511278

The events of the Second World War were still fresh enough in their collective minds to demand that the United States defeat Hollywood's squiggly beasties with the same determination that it confronted the Axis powers.  In THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, director Arnold Laven creates a high level of tension in his tale of a voracious oversized caterpillar that emerges from a salt lake to devour swimmers. For a film that was saddled with a low budget, Laven nevertheless managed to assemble a superstar stable of Class B actors, all of whom treat seriously and believably the threat.  Tim Holt is the lead as the Handsome Navy Commander who faces down fearlessly the Big Bug with a fire extinguisher.  Gordon Jones (from Abbott & Costello's Mike the Cop) is convincing in his role as the town sheriff.  Hans Conreid who here plays drama as deftly as he did Uncle Tonoose in comedy in Make Room for Daddy shines as the atomic scientist who tries to identify the creature.

When an earthquake hits the area, the bottom of the lake bed widens to release several gigantic sea bugs that had been hibernating since the Cretaceous.  These bugs begin to eat swimmers and lay their eggs for the next generation.  The US navy gets involved as it tracks their progress from lake to ocean.  TMTCTW is full of varying emotions, not all of which relate to terror and suspense.  There is also some underplayed yokel comedy of a weirdly speaking cartographer and the obligatory romance between Holt and Audrey Dalton, who plays a secretary who takes a liking to the beefy Holt.  There is also the near obligatory scene of a cute and innocent child who turns a switch the wrong way to awaken the beast from his slumber. But the dramatic thrust of the film is a straightforward account of the discovery, growth, spread, and ultimate confrontation of the bugs by the navy.  Audiences saw in these bugs the same sort of threat posed by the enemy of the past decade: squash 'em and get entertained in the process.  Hollywood might wish to remember that the old ways to film monster movies may work as well now as then.",1253404800,,2160,4.69761273209549
524528,5,6302872669,"On this great DVD you get two old sci-fi classics on one disc. First you have ""The Monster that Challenged the World"". Then you have ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"". I give both of these great movies five stars.

The Monster that Challenged the World:

The film did seem a little long at times, but other than that it was a great movie. I first saw this about a month ago on TV and found it to be quite enjoyable. The monster (and latter monsters) was very scary and convincing, and the story and acting were top-notch. An earthquake causes a cave to open up under the sea, and from the cave emerges an ancient man-eating sea creature that dares to challenge the world - and almost wins too. The creature starts to attack fishermen and teenage swimmers (hello ""Jaws"") before finally going onto the surface to feed on people near the shore line. Eventually more creatures start to emerge and soon its a race against time to destoy these creatures before they spread too much indangering all mankind and the world itself!

It! The Terror from Beyond Space:

A little old fashion for now days, but back in it's time it was one of the most well-done and suspenseful movies out there. And even though some things in the film are hard to except now days, it is still a pretty suspenseful film. In fact, this film inspired the 1979 horror classic ""Alien"". Some have gone far enough to say that this is actually an earlier version of ""Alien"". That is not true; there are a lot, and I mean a lot of differences, but I can see that this film was certainly an inspiration for ""Alien"". A rocket ship takes off from Mars on a journey back to Earth with the crew unaware that a monsterous alien creature has gotten aboard. The creature then starts to kill off the crew members one by one until finally they find a way on how to kill it - to open the airlock door and suck the oxygen out into space thereby suffocating the creature to death while the crew remain safe in their spacesuits. Although, it makes no sense to have guns, gernades, and bazookas on board an exploration spacship, and that the crew didn't seem too concerned about blowing a hole in the ship's hull, this was a pretty good film. The ship was pretty darn neat, and for back in its day, pretty realistic. The ship is dark and atmospheric, and the creature was pretty damn scary. Not as scary as the one in ""Alien"", but still pretty damn scary; the scariest for 1958!

These films were no doubt the best and scariest ones of their time! Highly recommended!",1248048000,5,2514,4.432900432900433

During the days of VHS why would a studio crop a 1:85 to full screen when the film minis the crop was already full screen. If it is a major film they might have done pan & scan but a lesser film, just scan it as is. You can see the cost savings. This appears to be the case also with some full screen DVDs but to a lesser degree. I believe ""It!

During the days of VHS why would a studio crop a 1:85 to full screen when the film minus the crop was already full screen. If it is a major film they might have done pan & scan but a lesser film, just scan it as is. You can see the cost savings. This appears to be the case also with some full screen DVDs but to a lesser degree. I believe ""It! The Terror from Outer of Space"" and ""The Monster that Challenged the world"" are these full prints. Just set your DVD player to full and TV to Zoom. Your player and TV may use different terminology. I watched It! and Monster this way (Wide 16:9) and it works! No heads cut off. No missing action. You'll notice the title and credits fit perfectly.

524533,2,6302872669,"This MGM ""Midnite Movies"" release(double sided disc) has two Sci-Fi films from the 50s on it,The Monster That Changed the World and It,the Terror from Beyond Space.
""Monster"" starts the DVD out and it concerns the story of a government research lab at the southern end of the Salton Sea,located inland in Southern California. It seems they do all sorts of Government type experiments there including,of course,radiation. But for some reason some of the research involves sky diving into the Salton Sea. They don't seem to have thought it would be less wet on the sky divers and less laborious to recover them on land,but I suppose we shouldn't ask that question. Anyhoos,a boat sent to pick up a recent skydiver doesn't find its' charge and loses one of its own recovery team to boot. Another boat  is dispatched to find them and discovers a crewman in the original boat dead of a heart attack,a sticky substance aboard and the body of the sky diver is recovered and not in too good of shape either. Something is definitely wrong here as this just isn't your average skydiving routine. A navy ""investigator"" who just happens to be at the research station leads the hunt for the cause of all of this. The lead scientist there played with total seriousness and lack of emotion by well known actor let-me-out-of-this-stinker Hans Conried,is just as baffled until murders start occuring. It seems mollusk like creatures have grown to enormous size and are threatening to overrun the area,which could eventually affect the rest of the world if not checked. The creatures themselves resemble giant caterpillars with two bulbous eyes when on the attack,but when at rest resemble giant snail shells(escargot anyone?).Everyone finally gets down to brass tacks and defeats the radioactive induced menaces!
This movie is just one in a slew of 50s Sci-Fi flicks that put the ""bad"" into B-movies. The action here is stop and go(mostly stop!),the acting is sub par and the special effects are cheesy at their very best. It's a one to one and a half star yawn fest.
On the other hand we have the movie It,the Terror from Beyond Space.""It"",while not referring to Clara Bow,does refer to a creature which sneaks aboard a space craft leaving Mars. It is a recovery ship who came to pick up a lone survivor,a Col. Carruthers(Marshall Thompson,later of TVs Daktari show),from a previous expedition. His crew are all dead and he has stated he is innocent and that something killed them but not him. No matter,he is to be taken back and charged for the crews deaths in a court martial. Well on the return flight people start disappearing and dying as they come to learn ""It"" is also aboard and is bent on killing everything it can. At first this large reptillian-like creature with powerful claws is confined to a relatively small part of the ship. As the murders grow so does the space it inhabits,until the tide is reversed and it is the crew that find themselves confined to a small area of the ship. Everything is hurled at the creature until they decide in desperation to blow a hatch and manage to get it sucked out into the void.
""It"" is definitley the superior movie of the two. The acting is pretty good all around and it manages to generate a nice air of tension and claustrophobia throughout as the crew gets pushed farther and farther back up the ship. It is a kill or be killed scenario as ""It"" is hell bent on destroying them all,and it almost succeeds. I would give this flick about three to three and a half stars.
Technically ""It"" is in the best shape out of the two. It is an excellent print,quite clear and crisp throughout.""Monster"" on the other hand while clear has many dirty areas throughout and around the 55 minute mark there starts to appear a vertical line(from top to bottom frame)about a quarter into the picture from the left side. This thing stays for a while then fades in and out until the picture ends. Quite a distraction. On top of all this both of these features are widescreen features and they are NOT in widescreen here. When are studios going to get it into their heads that when a movie is filmed in widescreen,THAT is exactly what should be released? A film's original aspect ratio should be honoured at ALL times! No excuses.
In conclusion then It,the terror from Beyond Space wins the battle of the films,hands down here,no question. For a lower budget B-movie it certainly has its'moments and the acting is definitely a little above par. On the the other hand The Monster that Challenged the World.....lost in more ways than one. From its' stilted acting, to its'cheap and lame ""monsters"" and to its' bad directing ,it's a stinker through and through. A movie for Sci-Fi compleatists only.
Along with this movies' bad rating,what brings this entire release package's rating down even farther is its' release of these movies NOT in their original aspect ratios.

It the Terror from Beyond Space is an entertaining B movie about monster that is on a spaceship returning to Earth and kills people, some chilling scenes. This movie inspired Alien and the monster was played by Ray Corrigan. Really a lot of low budget entertainment in both films. They are short and just a good way to escape for a little while.

""The Monster That Challenged the World"" is about giant snails that spring out of the Salton Sea and terrorize the world and, if you pardon the pun, is sluggish, to say the least.  It's silly hokum.

The reason to watch this DVD is the second feature ""It!  The Terror from Beyond Space.""  This is a tense little sci-fi thriller that reminds me of the fifties' classic ""The Thing from Another World.""  Made on a shoestring, ""It!  The Terror from Beyond Space"" generates taut suspense.  I know the Martian creature called ""It"" looks cheesy and obviously fake compared to today's monsters, but it doesn't matter.  This movie is a cut above the average sci-fi flick.

2) interesting examples of workman-like acting and production values for low budget studio films. Not gems or classics, but serious attempts to deliver some entertainment value wherein the actors, writers, and directors did not carry on as though they were above their material.
Monster is another cautionary about the effects of radiation, with giant amphibious mollusks, reminscent of SNL's landsharks. IT!  is a 10 Little Indians in Space kind of tale that inspired ALIEN.

I fondly remember Holt with actor Richard Martin in an earlier series of B-Westerns in which they usually played Tim & Chito respectively. These were lots of fun and should be checked out by those who may be interested.

To start, this is a wonderful old black and white ""B"" horror film from the 1950's. I can not understand why we never see these old films on TV. I see many old black and white films on AMC and really enjoy them, but most I've never heard of. I recall when growing up, sitting up to the wee hours of the morning, waiting with anticipation, for these wonderful movies to come on. In our area, Double Chiller Theatre came on at 11:30 each Saturday night and I begged my mother to let me sit up and watch these movies. Two movies would be shown and I recall my favorites were, ""House On Haunted Hill"". ""War of the Colassal Beast"", ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"", ""The Werewolf"" and ""It,The Terror From Beyond Space"". In my opinion, it is sad that the kids of today do not care for, or appreciate these wonderful old films. I only hope that more of the ""B"" horror films are released soon on DVD. Let's face it, once our generation is gone, nobody will care about these wonderful old films.",1165622400,89,1133,4.274418604651163
524551,1,6302872669,"There are two glaring omissions in this movie that send it below the camp category to the merely ridiculous bin.

First, is that thoughout the movie, the U.S. Navy fights the monsters with no weapons. Even at a research lab you would think the Navy might have a spare .45 or M-1 lying around. Yet even when the sailors go out to find the monsters they carry no weapons. Here plot necessity drives reality. Since the mollusks are soft-bodied they are easy to kill. Therefore, the Navy has to be disarmed to sustain the tension. Even when it becomes clear that monsters are indeed challenging the world, no armed troops show up. Instead, the ""hero"" {Tim Holt} is reduced to throwing glass beakers at a mollusk threatening the love interest and her adorable daughter {Mimi Gibson}.

Moreover, the film makers did this on a shoe-string and a very frayed one at that. The Navy has no boats. Instead, the sailors float around on a couple of tacky looking wooden rejects, no doubt borrowed from the localfishing fleet.

You may enjoy the primitive amateurishness of this, but only if you keep your tongue very hard pressed against your cheek.

524552,5,6302872669,"It's always a pleasure when the B-movies of our childhood are released onto DVD. We don't see these little gems anymore on television (even though we have over 100 channels), mainly, I think, because they are in black and white and this is a color TV world.

But these are the films we stayed up on countless Saturday nights to see and they remain with us psychotronic fans as a most pleasant memory. This MGM Midnite Movies entry is a perfect example, as we find that we enjoy these films all over again. Now, if we can only get the kids to sit still for black and white.

The first movie ""The Monster That Challenged the World"" (1957)is an intelligently thought out little picture. Mysterious disappearances are occurring in the Salton Sea. Tim Holt (Remember him from ""treasure of the Sierra Madre""?) and scientist Hans Conreid (Uncle Tounoose from ""Make Room for Daddy"") investigate and discover that an earthquake has freed prehistoric mollusks. If not stopped, they will overrun the environment. The movie moves at a brisk pace and has several good chills. Look for character actor Milton Parsons in a small role as the county archivist.

""It! The Terror from Outer Space"" (1958) is a better movie than one would suspect from the title. In the year 1973 (!) a ship is sent to Mars to rescue the survivors of a previous manned excursion. Of that original crew, only Marshall Thompson is left alive. Circumstantial evidence has him pegged as the killer, but as the crew soon learns, a Martian stowaway is responsible and will kill this crew if nothing is done to stop it. Intelligently scripted by Jerome Bixby (who wrote a few ""Star Trek"" and ""Outer Limits"" episodes in the 60s), the picture always keeps us involved. The acting is also solid, with Thompson, Dabbs Greer, and Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan in the monster suit. It may be of some interest that the film was remade by Ridley Scott in a fashion as ""Alien.""

524553,4,6302872669,"This is not at all a bad movie. It is certainly not Mystery Science Theatre 3000 material. The special effects are decent for its era. The acting is generally commendable (the little girl who accidentally hatches the monster's egg in the laboratory being the sole exception). The story is sort of a combination of Them and Jaws (considering the impressive mandibles possessed by these giant irradiated mollusks, the film could have been titled Them Jaws!). Like Them, it deals with giant irradiated creatures (mollusks instead of ants). Like Jaws, a small seaside town is thrown into chaos when its beaches are closed after several mysterious undersea killings. Also like Jaws, we've got the sexually active girl who goes swimming at night and becomes one of the first victims of the underwater terror. And then there are the suddenly-appearing heads of underwater corpses, similar to the scene in Jaws where Hooper drops the shark tooth after being frightened by the bloated and decayed head of a dead fisherman. The production quality here is relatively high for a B movie. The dialog is intelligent if not terribly inspired. The story is livened by various oddball secondary characters -- a telephone receptionist who spends all her time talking to her mother, a rare-documents archivist who speaks 18 languages and spends all his time complaining about a ballot proposition whose defeat he laments. Don't expect a masterpiece, but this is a good solid piece of sci-fi filmmaking that still works as a suspense story. The monsters, though a bit cheesy, are nonetheless effective and frightening. You can find this film doubled up on the same disc with ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space,"" the 1958 film that inspired the Alien franchise. Both are better than average examples of the 1950s creature feature genre. These are the kinds of movies that, during the 60s and 70s often played on the late show on TV, where they attracted more viewers than they ever got in the theater. This is not a movie that's so campy its funny. It provides a few unintended yuks (as well as many intended Yuck! s), but it will not disappoint fans of the genre.

524555,3,6302872669,"I really wanted to give this movie four stars, but a few things got in the way, which I will go into later.  The Monster That Challenged the World (1957), wow, that's a mouthful, is actually a smidge better than lots of other films of this type produced around the mid to late 50's.

The film stars Tim Holt as Lt. Cmdr. John 'Twill' Twillinger.  I best remember Holt from the Humphrey Bogart classic Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) but he's been in a ton of other films including My Darling Clementine (1946) and Swiss Family Robinson (1940) to name a couple.  The movie also stars Audrey Dalton as Gail MacKenzie and Hans Conried as Dr. Jess Rogers.  If you don't recognize Conried's face, you may recognize his voice, as he did voices for various cartoon shows like Woody Woodpecker, Rocky & Bullwinkle, Tom & Jerry, Dudley Do-Right, and narration on the Dr. Suess classic, Horton Hears a Who! (1970).

The film opens on the Salton Sea, a lake that occupies a desert basin in southern California.  A military base, located near the body of water, regularly performs parachute testing, with the jumpers landing in the sea.  After a recent tremor, a routine pickup from the waters turns into a horrific nightmare, with three men dead, two drained of all their fluids, and one scared to death.  An investigation turns up more questions than it answers.  A diving expedition reveals a new cavern has opened at the bottom of the lakebed, and some curious egg-like sacs are present.  The expedition also reveals a large, monstrous creature with large, sharp pinchers that proceeds to gobble on one of the divers.  The men on the boat come into contact with the beast, poking it in the eye with a big stick.  Dr. Rogers puts forth the theory, based on the evidence collected, that these are prehistoric mollusks that had been dormant for many years, and have been revived due to the tremor and traces of radioactive materials in the waters due to atomic testing (At least the creatures size wasn't solely attributed to atomic 'embiggening' as was common with films of this type at the time).  Anyway, thus begins the chase to hunt down all the creatures, as there are more than one, and with the distinct possibility that these creatures may navigate their way into a series of channel locks and end up in open waters causes the military to hasten their efforts to track down the human fluid draining monsters.  The fear is that due to the size and appetite of the creatures, and their capacity and efficiency for reproduction, they would deplete the oceans rather quickly and move onto land for human sustenance.

As I said before, I enjoyed the film, but there were a few flaws.  One being when Dr. Rogers, keeping one of the eggs in a temperature controlled tank in a fairly unsecured and unguarded area tells everyone that the egg won't hatch as long as the easily accessible temperature dial isn't changed from its' setting.  Well guess what?  Someone fiddles with it, and the egg hatches.  I mean, given how much Dr. Rogers went out of his way to tell us how important it was that this dial remain where it was, one couldn't help but wonder not if but when it was going to be changed, as such a clunky piece of exposition rarely is for naught in films like this.  Also, I thought Tim Holt's portrayal of his character made him look like a real brown noser jerk.  I'm sure it was written that way, and a softer side was shown at times, but it was still off putting and really didn't endear the character to me much.  I will say the creatures looked really spectacular, especially the scene where the egg hatches in the laboratory and the monster terrorizes a couple of people.  Imagine a giant, slobbery, snail-like monster, voracious for your fluids and you get the picture.  The shells the creatures used for homes also looked very good and realistic.  The creatures did have a good amount of screen time, allowing for the viewer to get a good look at them, which wasn't always the case in movies like this, especially cheaper ones, limiting the screen time due to costs.

The print used here was okay, but did show a number of signs of wear and tear, with speckling and a few scenes with vertical lines on the print.  Also, the film has been modified to full screen format, which I try to avoid, if possible.  Given the quality of the film and lack of any special features (I would have loved a featurette on the creatures), I would be hard pressed to give this the 3 to 4 stars it deserves.  All in all, a really good movie with a sub par release, and one that reinforces the necessity to obey the `no swimming' signs when posted as you never know if the reasoning is because of high E Coli counts or prehistoric mollusks intent on draining your precious bodily fluids through your neck.  You've been warned.

524556,3,6302872669,"The Monster that Challenged the World (1957), directed by Arnold Laven and starring Tim Holt, Audrey Dalton and Hans Conried, is an above-average grade-B film about giant, mutated mollusks from the bottom of the Salton Sea. The action takes place in the vicinity of a naval base commanded by Tim Holt, with Conried the navy scientist who provides all the explanations. The huge creatures, mutated as a result of radioactivity from atomic testing and freed after millions of years thanks to earthquake activity, drain the body fluids out of their victims. Yuk. Above-average special effects, interesting story, and convincing acting combine to make this film one of the best of its type.

524559,3,6302872669,"As B-flick as a B-flick can get, what redeems this one is a really great monster - or nest of monsters, as the case may be, on the ocean floor. You know how it is, when our toxic dumps in the ocean start mutating natural animal life into something inexplicably hostile to man - and many times larger. In this case, the mutated beasties are sea anelids - big, creepy-crawly, segmented worms, with eno-o-o-ormous snapping mandibles, rather like two curved javelins. They have disgusting eating habits, slobbering gucky white poison all over the remains of their meals, which the damned things never bother to clean up after they've finished. They also suck people's body juices out (""Mm-mm - ! Tastes like chicken!"") as if by a straw, leaving dried-out, mummified husks of men, where once stood the Navy's Finest (and you all thought the really militant Feminists were bad!).
Can the U.S. Navy clean up its hungry toxic mess? Will the dauntless Captain get the adorable girl-next-door, while they try? Do we really taste like chicken?
The answer to these and other questions you could care less about will go unnoticed, while you enjoy the great monster effects.

524560,3,6302872669,"With little fanfare, MGM has quietly transferred a handful of great B films to DVD that they not too arbitrarily categorize as ""Midnight Movies.""  The nice looking digital prints are in their original theatrical format and appear as if they were taken from original material. The discs come with no substantial extras but care has been lavished on the box art, often reflecting the lurid lobby cards and posters of their initial release.  Even acknowledging the B category, these are for the most part well-crafted and, almost adequately acted.
""THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD""  Get this -- there's an earthquake in our Palm Springs area Desert Empire that unleashes killer crustaceans under the Salton Sea. It's hard not to think this is some kind of low budget cinematic prophesy based on the massive Landers quake of 91.  At least I was willing to suspend my own disbelief at the premise and enjoy the wonderful, dilapidated Salton Sea resort locations.  Tim Holt and Audrey Dalton star along with the deliciously sardonic Hans Conreid.
And now we know what is causing the massive Salton Sea pollution. Mary Bono please take note before the creatures mutate and rise again.",1019088000,6,1183,4.9847715736040605
524561,3,6302872669,"In the atomic age '50s, there were giant ants, prehistoric scorpions, one or two giant spiders, an over-sized preying mantis, and at least one giant octopus.  Not to mention various radioactive dinosaurs and invaders from space.  Now it's time to trot out giant mollusks.  The usual elements are present in this B movie:  hideous giant creatures, grimly determined heroes, innocent victims, mysterious deaths, suspense, and pseudo-scientific explanations.  The pace of the story is herky-jerky.  Sudden bursts of action are followed by dull analysis and investigation.  Some of the action takes place under water.  The special effects are okay, if nothing special.  Giant snails are a little, er, sluggish, regardless.  Sometime Western actor Tim Holt is a strictly business Navy officer until he meets Audrey Dalton working at Hans Conried's lab.  We conclude that Uncle Tonoose was a scientific egghead before ""The Danny Thomas Show.""  Dalton's little girl can't leave the lab equipment settings alone, and that leads to more terror.  It seems there is a giant mollusk egg preserved in a tank of temperature controlled water.  The DVD edition includes Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio.  The movie is in glorious B&W.  The full screen DVD image is sharp and clear, if a little dark toned in places.  Optional Spanish and French subtitles are available.

524562,3,6302872669,"You're not likely to be frightened by MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but as 1950s sci-fi/horror programmers go it is better than most.  The story, which resembles everything from THEM! to THE THING to BLACK LAGOON, concerns prehistoric eggs that are irradiated by atomic blast and then released by earthquake into a saltwater sea by a military station--where several military men go missing as a result.
The cast, script, story, and monster are all okay but nothing special and never rise above the ""B Movie"" level, but the movie is an enjoyable way to spend a rainy evening.  It's also mild enough for use as a ""family night"" film with older kids, and would be a good way to introduce them to the genre without giving them fits; younger kids, however, will either be bored or genuinely frightened, so you might want to prescreen it just in case.",1010707200,6,850,4.736486486486487

Hans Conreid is always fun, even when he's playing a serious scientist with a major denial problem when it comes to the effect of radiation on snails. Could it possibly turn them into man-eating creatures that will take over the world? Naaaah...!

Yep, right smack dab in the center of where the Monster decided to challenge the world! I started looking at the local canals a lot more closely at night!
The DVD version has crisp video....much nicer than the VHS version. It was a MUST HAVE for my collection.
Okay, the flick is a little on the lame side....but it's still one of the most fun of the genre. Those mighty mollusks are simply too funny for words. And our hero is so busy chasing women, he almost lets the Imperial Valley and all of Baja Norte fall into the evil mollusk mandibles (do mollusks have mandibles?).
Absolutely essential viewing if you've ever lived in Baja or the Imperial Valley, or even in Southern California. And essential if you are at all into the B monster flicks of AIP and the like.
And it makes the Salton Sea look so very large!  It is also fun to see the place as it looked in the late 50's.

524569,4,6302872669,"This movie gets high marks first, for the ability of the cast to keep a straight face and play this silly melodrama like it might really have happened. However, a funny thing starts to happen after the first boat/monster scene, it starts getting interesting. So well is this seriousness executed by the entire cast, that the cliche plot and low-tech special effects can be overlooked, making this movie a ""reel"" winner on that basis. Also, there are genuine tense moments both under and above the water and excellent pacing. Somehow when it is all said and done this B Creature Feature develops enough collective energy and tension to please most fans of ""Atomic Era Creature Features."" The 83 minute video buzzes by all too quickly somehow making me wish for more.
