5943894,4,B00EU8RCQ8,i bought this for my daughter who is in love with the gator boys to the point she wants to go to meet them. I haven't seen this season yet but it seems weird to me that they would  only have one disc but cant wait to watch it . I love the guys and they aren't hard to look at,1387756800,,275,3.5081967213114753

5943896,5,B00EU8RCQ8,"I adore this show!  I own season one, and have watched plenty of times.  Season two is the same way, but only better!  There is plenty of great alligator action!  Paul and Jimmy make a great pair!  There is no shortage of hold your breath action in this DVD!",1408838400,,258,4.183673469387755

5943900,5,B00EU8RCQ8,Love those GATOR boys and gals. More great episodes of Paul and Jimmy out to rescue more alligators that would otherwise be killed.,1392249600,,131,4.739130434782608
5943901,5,B00EU8RCQ8,Absolutely LOVE Gator Boys I only wish that this season had more episodes in it. Oh well I guess I will just have to wait for more seasons to come out! ;-),1391299200,,155,3.875
5943902,5,B00EU8RCQ8,"Awesome! I love this show, and am so glad to have some of it on DVD. It is not the complete season, and I've learned to realize that if ""complete"" isn't spelled out nowadays, expect that it is not the complete season. Sad. I'd give it fewer stars for that fact, but others already have, and I don't want those that watch ratings to think the low star number is for the show itself and not produce more seasons of it. So, five stars for the show itself! I'm really glad that ""Gators Gone Wild"" made it onto this disc. Two of my favorite things on earth were featured in that episode. Now, why wasn't I able to find a single calendar from that photo shoot?! Oh, well. Sigh.",1390953600,,671,4.209302325581396
5943903,1,B00EU8RCQ8,"I was really hoping that when it said Season 2, it meant the entire Season 2.  That's not true...it only has a select 5 or 6 episodes and no more.  When are they going to have complete seasons available?  That's what I want.  Of course, the episodes are great, but not the whole season.",1389052800,,286,4.2407407407407405
5943904,1,B00EU8RCQ8,"This is a rip off, I give it 1 star because there are only 5 episodes on the DVD not because of the content,there definitely are more then 10 Episodes for both seasons 1 & 2 ,I know because as a fan of the show I have ALL 21 Episodes of Season 1 & 2 on my DVR,they pulled this same thing with the season 1 DVD,so this most likely is just 5 more shows from season 1 that they are trying to pass off as season 2.",1388966400,2,410,3.6704545454545454
8609377,5,B00EU8RCQ8,This is a great show. The price was great too considering there are only 5 episodes in season 2.,1527638400,,96,4.105263157894737
