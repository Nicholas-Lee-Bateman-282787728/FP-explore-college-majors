8227216,5,B000X73NA4,"History is all about proximity; the distance over time, between spaces, or the mental distance that we all create within ourselves to interpret and relate to the past, ourselves and our futures. KZ is essentially a question of proximity, too, examining how living near the town of the last concentration camp to be liberated affects tour guides and residents. Does it matter that you live within sight of where thousands of humans were tortured to death? Is the field where tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews remain just another field, or does it retain a quality unique to their memory and pain? And what impact does it have upon visitors, who seem so jovial upon arrival and then so solemn upon exit. How long does that memory haunt them, until the next cheeseburger?

This is a very powerful film and I think it ranks among the top ten of holocaust documentaries, or films about the nature of suffering and proximity.",1215043200,3,921,4.75625
8227217,5,B000X73NA4,"I had been waiting to see this unique film for quite a while. It isn't the easiest to track down. It is a beautifully shot, thoroughly engrossing look at life in the idyllic small Austrian town of Mauthausen. Idyllic, perhaps, but for the dark shadow forever cast across it by the Mauthausen concentration camp.

The film conducts a sort of virtual tour through both the camp itself, and the scenic town adjoining it. With elegance and understatement, the filmmakers manage to convey both the horrors associated with the camp, and the intrusive complications that are so much a part of live in the town.

The viewer's journey is conducted through a series of interviews with groups of school children and tourists, as they are led on their tour through the camp; as well as extended interviews with some of their tour guides, many of whom reveal complex and difficult relationships with the camp, and their roles as shepherds of the innocent through its haunting grounds.

As Mauthausen is one of the most well-preserved concentration camps in existence, the journey through it is, perhaps, somewhat more confronting than it might otherwise be. Even the gas chambers and ovens are in relatively undamaged shape. Chilling.

Outside the camp itself, the people of Mauthausen are interviewed about their lives in the town, as well as some of the complications that can arise in calling Mauthausen home. Particularly disturbing are the views expressed by a small group of women who lived in the town during its dark years, one who was married to an SS officer posted to the camp.

This is a terrific film. A towering achievement. It provides a compelling insight into one of the darkest periods in human history, as well as the difficult legacy of that time. It is sensitively and intelligently conceived and executed, and succeeds in pulling you into the world depicted seemingly effortlessly. A worthwhile and thought-provoking experience.",1208995200,5,1937,5.021806853582555
