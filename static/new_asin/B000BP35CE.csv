8090537,5,B000BP35CE,"This is a film adaptation of the Helen Garner novel, and it is beautifully acted, particularly by a very young Noni Hazlehurst, in an award-winning performance.  Colin Friels is marvellous as the lover, and the daughter of the writer, Alice Garner, captivates as the daughter of the main character, played by Noni.
It is raw and confronting at times, but well worth the watching.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in Australian film, and admirers of Helen Garner's writing.",1414800000,,482,5.0125

Performing is good and a problem of ageing mentality embedded perfectly from viewpoint of Melbournian environment where music, drugs and sex are in a reasonable not dominating mix provided.

Not boring work at all.",1166313600,,374,5.114754098360656
