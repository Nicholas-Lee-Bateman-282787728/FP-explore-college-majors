2590583,3,B000FUZY38,"I am one of those hardcore martial arts fans and I try to not only see but own every great to good movie on the market, over the years I compiled a significate collection of films. At this point now I'm trying to view the Koreon style of film making thats why I purchased this movie, so far I found some simularites in the Koreon, Chinese and Japanese. But in my opinion the Chinese are by far superior the Koreons and Japanese show much more aggression and brutality where the Chinese are more artistic. This movie is a good combination of all three the fighting is fair not a lot of extended stand and fight but mostly cameras and effects. I could tell how the story line was going to flow which wasn't that bad and I was glad to see the women fighters steal the movie overall a fair movie not on the level that would have like to have seen.",1194825600,,843,4.209876543209877
2590584,2,B000FUZY38,"I want the two hours of my life back... ugh.  Very improbable plot and it doesn't appear Koreans do wu shu flying as well as the Chinese, probably because the Koreans put alot of power into the flying sequences, when they are best done with grace such as in Chinese movies.

Special effects are not well done.  The water fighting scene was laughable.  Also, the love story was too contrived and formulaistic if you are familiar with Korean love plots.

All in all, it was a big yawn.  I don't know why I persisted through the entire thing.",1192665600,,539,4.448979591836735
2590585,3,B000FUZY38,"Having just watched this film, ""Shadlowless Sword,"" after viewing ""Seven Swords,"" with Donnie Yen, I was almost tempted to give this film 5 stars. I bought this film almost one year ago, and finally got around to watching it. I think this film could have been better, especially if the comic elements in the film were taken out, however, this is the way the film is presented so I will have to live with it. Also, the film really has no plot, but then that does not necesarily mean it won't be a fun film. Which is what this film is meant to be: Entertaining and fun! Also, one of the things I like about films is character development, and there is none in this film. Having written this, however, I do think the film will appeal to some viewers of this genre.

Further, I found the film entertaining and visually stunning. And although the action scenes in the film were okay, they were not as good as some of the ones I have seen from Hong Kong martial arts films. The main thing for me, however, is that I really wish that the films from Korea and HK, were more serious in their nature. I think that the Jackie Chan style of comical acting needs a makeover: especially since so many of the films [and this one in particular] are so beautiful in their visual effects. The costumes are great, they just need a little more seriousness, that's all.

Therefore, for me I would like to see more seriousness in Korean action scenes. I liked ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and ""Hero"" even though they stretched realism in their combat scenes. But I really believe that Korean films need to distance themselves from HK films, because they can be truly masterful if realism was placed in their action films. The flowery combat of the wuxia style from the aforementioned films were good, but now I would like to see some real gritty realism that one finds in Japanese cinema. I really liked ""Shinobi,"" and ""Azumi 1&2."" And even though they were Japanese films which stretched the limits of believability, this was an abberation, and not the norm. Which is why I probably liked them so much. Anyway, I recommend the film. Rent it first [If it is still available].",1170979200,13,2151,4.526992287917738
2590586,5,B000FUZY38,I actually didn't expect this to be so good...but man...I really enjoyed this...great swordplay and emotion...,1169683200,3,110,5.9375
2590587,5,B000FUZY38,I bought this movie from a seller along with Shinobi. I really liked them both. Lots of fight sequences and a really great story. Shadowless Sword and Shinobi are both worth buying and I didn't regret it at all. Try getting them quickly before they aren't available.,1156550400,5,266,4.680851063829787
2590588,4,B000FUZY38,"Shadowless Sword is the second film effort by the director of Bichunmoo. In my opinion, it may have surpassed the first film or at least equal to it.

 This film revolves around the story of 2 feuding noble families, the House of Bael has been on the receiving end of violent attacks by the Killer Blade army. Almost all of the Royal Family have murdered by the leader of the Killer Blade army, except one. A prince who went into hiding because he believed himself unworthy of royalty because he felt like there is nothing that can be done of the strife in his country. It is up to a female warrior called Soha to convince him to lay his claim upon the throne. Which it turns out harder than it seems that the remaining heir does not want to become King. The prince served in his father's military and there is a link/bond between the prince and his female protector. The villain is evil enough that audinces can dispise him at the same time pity him, yes, even the villain has his own ""justified motivation"". The action starts when the bad guys start pursuing the good guys.

 The action is impressive. as in most korean martial arts films, it has an influence of Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon, but believe me when I say it can stand on its own. The swordfights are well choreographed, Woon So-yi (from Arahan)can move as gracefully as any ballerina. The underwater scenes are well-shot and the sword fighting is well-paced. Unlike other Korean action films like Natural City, there is hardly any slow-mo.

 I'm not sure what they are selling in amazon, but it is probably a Malaysian/Taiwan copy. Just be careful, the quality of these dvds sometimes is not as good as the original imported ones, which is why they are cheap. Sometimes they may freeze a scene when played in most stand alone dvd players. I think these discs only try to fool the player so it can be played. The dvd I have is the 2 disc region 3 version with DTS audio. Since New Line Cinema invested in this Korean flick, I'm pretty sure there will be a region 1 version.

 Shadowless Sword is a very good film if you enjoyed HERO, AZUMI and SHINOBI. However, as with Shinobi and Azumi the imported region 3 versions are phenomenal, the video/audio quality far surpasses the ones made from Taiwan/Malaysia. Try to get the originals if you can play them on your players, if not, just don't miss this film.

 RECOMMENDED!!",1155772800,24,2388,4.545454545454546

If it weren't for some of the fights going too far over the topapproaching silliness at timesI would give this movie five stars.

The two leading women were inspiring.  Yun So-i is brilliant as Soha, the beautiful ninja-like warrior where the bad guys cringe at hearing shes involved.  Ki-yong Lee as bad-guy-Mae had me feeling her pain.  Their martial skills were profound.  Lee Seo-jin as the prince in hiding did a wonderful job evolving the character from meh to wow.  Well done.

2590745,5,B000FUZY38,"Like most Korean films based on Korea's five thousand year history, this one is highly romanticised.  It deals with the, enven for most Koreans, obscure Kingdom of Parhae, (Balhae).  While Parhae  has been some what forgotten until Lately, it played a critical role in East Asian history and at its zenith controlled most of what became Manchuria, along with territory east and north to the sea.  Parhae was pivotal in the formation of Korea's national identity.  As it happens my wife's sir name, Pyo traces the origin of her family to the Parhae aristocracy.  There is, even today, a sizable population of ethnic Koreans living in Chinese territory originally part of Parhae.  these people have managed to maintain there language and their cultural purity over the ensuing many centuries sparking an argument currently, between China and South Korea over Parhae's nation origin which has more that just historic consequences for ethnic Koreans living in China.",1369785600,,962,5.167741935483871
2590746,4,B000FUZY38,"Legend of the Shadowless Sword starts with an assassination of a Prince of the historical Kingdom of Balhae by its rival, Goryeo. The generals of Balhae, fearing the country will lose hope, send their best soldier to recover the exiled prince who is now the last of the royal line. Her search soon finds her in a back alley, surrounded by a dozen or so disreputable thugs, and all you can think is, man, those guys are *so* screwed!

Despite plenty of nicely ludicrous wire-fu action set-pieces, Shadowless takes itself pretty seriously. This can create some moments of cultural dissonance, like whenever Sosam tries to soulfully emote something from underneath what to western eyes looks like 80s-style action hero mullet. I got the feeling the movie was really looking for a domestic audience, so you may need to meet it half-way to appreciate it. If you can manage that, there is a pretty good story here between all the fisticuffs and sword duels. Soha's unflagging faith in a man who initially seems entirely unworthy of it is what gives the tale its emotional weight, and serves as a foil for her counterpart in the Goryeo army, Mae (who believes completely in somebody who actually *is* unworthy of it).

Despite its absurd and often awesome fight scenes, Shadowless is best enjoyed unironically. Recommended.",1367625600,,1316,4.923423423423423

I am 70 years old. I have learned more in the last year about the Korean people than I have in my entire life. For some reason it was time for me to find out about them. Why are they divided. That is such a tragedy. Without interference from outside countries, the USA included, would they not do better? I was shocked to learn Theodore Roosevelt gave Korea to Japan. I had never learned that in history. I recommend more people watch and learn. Watch the historical dramas. What an amazing country Korea is. What strong wonderful people live there.

2590773,2,B000FUZY38,"Visually the film looked good, and the bad guys looked pretty cool.  I liked the heroine that protected the prince too, although I had a tough time buying that she could fight - she seemed a bit dainty.  The main villianess was less believable.  She was wearing very obvious makeup (its supposed to be friggin 922 A.D.) and looked like she might break a nail.  Also, the male villian used this ridiculous ""technique"" that caused his opponents to explode.  That's right, I said explode.  So one moment he's fighting, and the next moment his oppononet just explodes - no apparent reason other than this supposed technique he mentions.  Say what!??  That aside, the fight scenes were just OK - too many close ups to really see the fighting, and they lacked the choreography and interest of the better Wuxia films.  Also a negative - the pacing was poor, and the movie didn't hold my interest.  I had to make myself finish watching it.

So on the plus side we have
1) nice visuals
2) cool looking bad guys
3) a pretty good heroine

On the negative side we have
1) Barbie not a good villian
2) stupid explosion ""technique""
3) underwhelming fighting
4) poor pacing and poorly executed back story were boring

If only one or two of the cons were present they could be overlooked.  #4 alone is the kiss of death.  Won't watch again.  Too bad considering the cool visuals.",1318982400,3,1363,4.570247933884297

2590782,3,B000FUZY38,"First off, great title for a film! One of my favorite movie titles ever I think, and well-chosen for this genre. I also liked the ""Killer Blade Army."" It's obvious that a lot of thought was put into this film, not only with the names but the way the movie was shot as well. I thought, however, the story was a bit weak and rather cliche for this genre, and I was disappointed with the introduction of the ""love story"" about mid-way through the film. And I also didn't find it very convincing. Plus, I don't like people flying around through forest trees, nor do I think it was necessary in this film. The strength of the film was the legend of the sword, and the way the sword-fighting scenes were shot was pretty cool. But why does it make sense to have people flying around? If the sword possesses certain powers and gives you certain powers, I can understand the extraordinary things that happen during fighting with the sword. But how is it exactly that the sword can make you fly? Not getting that one! And if the sword possessed the power to make you fly, why is it that your entire army of scrubs can also fly?! I understand that in Chinese martial arts films that this is sort of a magical realism, like a fairy tale of sorts, so perhaps it is similar in Korean martial arts films, or the producer/director decided to borrow from the Chinese style, but frankly it was distracting in this film and quite unnecessary I thought.

Those reservations aside, this is still probably the most entertaining of this type of film I've seen since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000) or ""House of Flying Daggers"" (2004). The cinematography, many of the sword fights and battles, and that hottie that plays the bad chick make this one pretty entertaining.

2590784,3,B000FUZY38,"Many of these films are great ancient asian war epics.  Great fight scenes and great martial art confrontations.  But, when they start flying around like fairies, it takes away alot of the authenticity of the possible reality that these confrontations could have possible happened in ancient asian culture.  This story was going great until they took to the sky and started flying as they were running.  I suddenly felt cheated from seeing a possibly excellent film.

They did this silly theatrical martial arts acrobatic dangling and flying wire-play in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""House of the Flying Daggers"" and who knows how many more.  What a dumb looking concept that just keeps being done over and over in today's martial arts films.  Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan never looked this stupid and yet Jackie Chan WAS trying to be kinda silly.

The best asian battle film I've seen where they didn't do this silly looking flying about was in ""Musa the Warrior"" which probably became my most favorite asian film (that included some martial arts) that was released in recent theater because the authenticity in the action scenes seemed alot more tangible.",1252972800,2,1190,5.00507614213198
2590785,2,B000FUZY38,"I agree with other reviewers that this was a Korean attempt to make an epic fantasy like Hero, or Crouching Tiger.  Where I disagree is in the rating of its success.  This movie certainly featured lush sets, perfect costuming, and lovely cinematography.  Unfortunately, the rest of the elements didn't rise to the same level.

First, the acting, especially of the two leads, was simply stiff and uninspired.  While the female star was certainly beautiful, she lacked the charisma of, say, Brigitte Lin or Michelle Yeoh, for example. One look at any of the work of those two ladies is enough to throw into sharp relief the wooden quality on display here.  For a supposedly determined and passionate warrior, she barely mustered a show of either emotion, or any other, for that matter.

As for the hero, he was completely devoid of charm, and didn't succeed at portraying his character as either the rogue prince slumming as an thief/art dealer or the re-inspired leader of his nation.  His blank face and monotone delivery sucked the life out of any interest his character was supposed to have.

It was strange that the actors were so bad at acting- because they sure weren't chosen for their martial arts skills, which were non-existent.  Doubles were employed at every opportunity, and transparently so.

Regarding the action, it was faux Hong Kong poorly done.  That is, the action scenes were inventively conceived and planned, but horribly executed, with incessant cutting and close-ups that were obviously designed to compensate for the total lack of skills on the part of the actors.  The use of doubles was painfully apparent.  Not only that, even when the doubles were playing, hardly a move was ever shown without a flurry of cuts that robbed the scenes of coherence, and deadened the ""wow"" factor that such scenes are meant to create.  A couple of ridiculously bad moments (such as an embarrassing underwater fight scene) also served to undermine the project.

The film also suffered from poor pacing.  This was ostensibly a chase film, but I rarely felt any particular suspense or tension.  A repetitive and dull musical score topped it all off with another layer of ho-hum.

I really wanted to like this movie.  I'm a huge fan of HK-style martial arts films, and can't get enough of movies like Once Upon a Time in China, or Ip Man, for example.  Unfortunately, I found Shadowless Sword to be all style and no substance: the trappings of a big-budget martial arts epic hung about the spindly frame of a badly executed rip-off of better films.",1243296000,6,2554,4.8657407407407405

2590792,4,B000FUZY38,"The plot works as well as any, and better than some: a lone warrior seeks out the prince in exile, to escort him to his rightful throne. A neat feature is that the warrior is a gorgeous young woman (plenty able to kick gluteals, though), and the prince looks like a slacker. He does OK in his secret identity as fence for stolen goods in some back province, but is that who you want on the throne? That's just the start, though, it gets better - partly when an ill-starred romance develops between prince and commoner.

This features plenty of well-choreographed swordfights, including a few with the equally capable woman on the opposition team. The look of this movie really stands out, though. We couldn't figure out what part of China this might have been placed in. Names sounded different from the more familiar Chinese ones, closer to Thailand, maybe? Then, a few scenes looked more like Silk Road somewhere, possibly towards Tibet - neither of us knows Chinese social geography well enough to be sure. Still, the unusual look of this movie makes it stand out from the pack. If you have an evening to kill, these swordfighters will do a great job of killing it for you.

And make no mistake, this film is Korea's attempt to duplicate the success of these modern classics both artistically and financially.  The result is an almost-great film steeped in female empowerment, classic martial-arts philosophy, and Korean history that only missed classic status by a decade or so.

First off, let me say that the leading ladies of ""Shadowless"" are amazing.  Yun So-i is brilliant as Soha, a female warrior tasked with bringing an exiled prince back home after an organization known as The Killer Blade Army murders the entirety of the royal family, leaving him as the only successor to the throne.  Soha and the prince, Jeong-Heyon (played by Lee Seo-jin) who is also quite the fighter, are tracked and ambushed by the Killer Blades led by a seriously vamped-out lady killer. The confrontations between the opposing sword-wielding visions of beauty provide some seriously exciting duels that are on par with the best of the genre.

The heart of the story largely focuses on the classical myth/philosophy of Asian swordplay that each blade has within it an evil spirit that gathers strength as it drinks human blood.  This spirit is said to be able to envelope and consume it's user once it gathers enough strength through death and suffering.  This is a fantastic metaphor for the effect taking a life has on a person's being.  What better way to kill one's own soul than by slaughtering so many as to becomes altogether indifferent to suffering?  This is the essence of evil.  Soho's philosophy -bequeathed to her at a young age by a passing hero- is that if the sword is taken up only to protect that which is precious and not to do harm that the shade within will gain no power from the act of killing.  Thus, a righteous warrior has a shadowless sword.

The coolest thing about ""Shadowless"" is arguably the costumes.  Every scene features some of the most visually interesting outfits and uniforms I've ever seen in this kind of film.  Big thumbs up on that. The movie itself looks wonderful and very polished, though many of the scenes feel like retreads of previous wuxia films.  There is an interesting underwater battle that could have been brilliant if not for the ridiculous sight of dozens of ninjas sailing over the river throwing hundreds of shurikens into the water for several minutes on end.  How many of those things do they keep on them at one time anyways?  There are some other over-the-top moments that may make one think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-the-North-Star/dp/B000ZEC7RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of the North Star</a>&nbsp;and the delayed explosions that resulted from the combat in that classic anime cheesefest.  But timed detonations somehow make even less sense when they are inflicted by a sword.  What, chopping a guy's head off or bisecting him at the waist or even vertically isn't good enough anymore?  These are a few of the problems that keep ""The Legend of the Shadowless Sword"" out of the same league as the modern works of art it emulates.  The love story is unconvincing after having seen the incredible beauty of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flying-Daggers/dp/B0007Q6VXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flying Daggers</a>, and the fights -while highly entertaining- are simply not as good as those in ""Crouching Tiger"".

In spite of it's few flaws, I would qualify ""The Legend of the Shadowless Sword"" as a must-see for fans of martial-arts or Asian cinema in general.  This one won't enjoy the crossover appeal of the movies I name-checked earlier, but it should thoroughly satisfy fans of the wuxia genre.  Not perfect, but worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as some of the greats.",1218672000,46,4310,5.634674922600619
2590797,4,B000FUZY38,"Seriously, I just want to know what marketing genius thought adding ""The Legend of the"" to the title would make it more appealing to the US audience (Drunken Master 2 becomes Legend of the Drunken Master).  With the exception of Dragon Dynasty, the now defunct Tartan Asian Extreme, and few smaller companies, US DVD distributors love to toy with these films.

The description lists this film as being in 1.33/1 aspect ratio.  Specialty sites have it listed as being in its original 2.35/1 ratio.  Let's hope they're right.  As of this writing, there is no running time listed.  If it comes in at anything under 113 minutes, you've been had.  US distributors like to try and get these films down to under 100 minutes.  That is the magic number for our attention spans apparently.  The bottom line is that if they keep the aspect ratio proper and don't hack anything out of it, you'll be in for a real treat.  Here's my review of the Korean import.

Shadowless Sword is another great entry from Korea, a country that has spent the new millennium really carving out their place in the asian film world. The story is basically just like King Ralph, except Peter O' Toole has to protect John Goodman from assassins before he can get back to Buckingham Palace and install a bowling alley in the royal bedchamber. Ok, so it's a little different than that. But it is an 'escort the VIP' movie.

SS is from the same director that gave us Bichunoo, another fantastic film. It has a great cast from films like ""Guns and Talks"" and ""Arahan"". SS is a swordplay epic. For the laymen, it would be in the same vein of a Crouching Tiger or a Hero or House of Flying Daggers. Period piece, acrobatic wire-fu, lots of swordplay. And while it may not have the budget, star power, and exposure of the previously mentioned films, it can absolutely hold its own against them.

The acting is spot on. The story, while not anything new, is still very engaging. And the action is certainly well worth the watch. Although not quite as graceful as some of it's HK counterparts, the wire work is creative and integrated well into the sequences. The visual approach is stylish without being over-the-top. And it does have a great score, too.

Fans of asian swordplay movies would be wise to give this one a look. It doesn't have the depth of story and character that those looking for something more in the drama category are looking for. And while the action is great, it's not wild and insane like a Kitamura movie or a Hark film, and certainly not as blood-filled. The action sequences would be considered reserved compared to how those guys work. So if you're looking for a good, solid swordplay epic that is subtle and understated while being quite entertaining and action-oriented, this would be a fine choice.",1217116800,10,2787,4.638211382113822

2590799,4,B000FUZY38,"During the Korean New wave, the country has come out with real phenomenal dramas, horror, and  a few swordplay epics. Two of the more successful films of Korean epics are the terrific Period adventure film ""Musa the Warrior"" and the Wuxia Fantasy Epic ""Bichunmoo"". There have also been other attempts to produce a Wuxia epic and most of them are either a hit or a miss. ""Shadowless Sword"" (aka. Muyeong Geom, retitled ""Legend of Shadowless Sword"") is from Kim Yung-jun, the same director of ""Bichunmoo"". This film fares a lot better when in regards to screenplay and action sequences compared to Kim`s first Wuxia film. The direction is much more coherent and solid this time. Action Junkies will certainly be entertained with this film, even though it was released 3 years ago in 2005 (despite New Line has invested in this film, it is now only getting a U.S. release?), the film still stands as one of the most entertaining Wuxia epics I've seen from South Korea.

10th century Korea, the Balhae Dynasty have all but fallen due to an invasion. Resistance fighters are hard pressed to find a new leader when all members of the Royal family have perished save one; Prince Jeong Hyeon (Seo Jin Lee). To avoid attention, a lone female warrior named Soha (Yoon So-yi, ARAHAN) is dispatched to find the Prince. Unbeknownst to her, the self-exiled Prince has become a dealer of used goods and have no intensions of returning to royalty. To make matters more complicated, the Killer Blade Army led by Gun Hwa-Pyeong (Hyeong Jun-Shin) with his second in command; lovely Mae (Ki-Yong Lee) is also on the trail of the Prince to assassinate him. Soha must convince the wayward prince just how important he is to her country's fate, awaken his fighting skills and protect him from the Killer Blade army.

While ""Bichunmoo"" had a more intricate storyline, its script was almost impossible to follow. Kim Yung-jun's second film has a larger budget and his directorial skills seems to have been honed. ""Shadowless Sword"" (I prefer to call it by its original title) has a simple storyline and is very predictable. No surprises can be had with this film, the film is actually a chase film; the two leads are being pursued all over while fighting their way back to Balhae. The usual formulas are omnipresent, Soha and Prince Jeong find each other; they bond and learn to care for each other with the usual twists in their past relationship. Its predictability may be somewhat disappointing if one is expecting a more complex script. However, the two leads are well-developed and the film's pace and style is mesmerizing enough that the film is never dull and boring.

The film's main draw and its greatest strength will have to its nicely executed swordplay and fight sequences. There are lots of nifty forest battles and a nicely shot underwater fight (although this may require a suspension of disbelief). The encounters between women-warriors Soha and Mae are truly exciting and quite enchanting. Their fights are beautifully shot, well-choreographed and intense. It was no accident that So-yi Yoon was cast as our female heroine after her performance in the action-fantasy ""Arahan"". The actress is charismatic, agile and once again proves that she is capable in the film's physical aspects.  Lee Ki-Yong also proves a worthy rival, she is in every way Soha's equal in martial arts skills. The film has a lot of fights and cool poses; even shurikens are thrown, high-flying Martial Arts are the film's style of fighting and rivals those seen in some of the best Chinese Wuxia epics. I've noticed that Korean filmmakers have started to evolve their own 'stylized' blood splattering effects, this time with a lot of ""explosive"" attitude.

While Yoon So-yi and Lee Ki-yong does undoubtedly steal the show, the main villain, played by Hyeong Jun Shin (Bichunmoo) is an almost identical twin to the villain in ""Gingko Bed"". I'm not sure, the actor does a decent job with his character overall, but something about the `eye-liner' just turns me off. Gun Hwa-Pyeong is more than a one-dimensional villain, his goals and motives are actually one that can generate sympathy but I suppose there are men who can pull off `mascara' and there are those who can't. Seo jin Lee does keep the movie moving, his character's devices to avoid his would-be protector and his assailants manages to add more depth to the film's simple plot. Also, Prince Jeong's change in attitude and his past does give some added `meat' to its plot. The most underused character is Mae, her character has a lot of potential but she seemed underdeveloped. The woman is loyal to Kun but their relationship does leave the reasons to mere  assumptions by the audience.

The film also has cleverly paced bits of satire in the first half as our two leads encounter a gang led by a character who looks like the Korean knock-off of ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" that made me crack up. The interlude where Soha and Prince Jeong encounter a band of bandits who look like `tribute' characters to ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a nice touch. The film is focused in its direction and the set designs are also quite good. The costumes are elaborate enough to draw attention and yet, they don`t look too superficial.

A film like ""Shadowless Sword"" will either shine or fail with its promise of pure action entertainment and on this promise it didn`t falter. The film is loaded with highly stylized martial arts that would definitely more than make up for its faults. The movements are precise and graceful enough while maintaining its hard-hitting intensity. Many would compare it to ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" which would be unfair (personally, I wasn't really that impressed with that movie). It`s a different film entirely and ""Shadowless Sword"" does stand on its own. If you want a lot of nicely shot stylized martial arts then this film will not disappoint.

""SHADOWLESS SWORD"" is a substantial entry to Korea's foray into Wuxia/Swordplay adventure. The film is definitely entertaining and enjoyable from beginning to end. The director's cut clocks in at 2 hours, and the direction is to be commended that it feels like it was a mere 90 minutes. Its abundance in action sequences, bits of humor, eye-candy wirework, the film goes at a pace that exudes pure entertainment that I forgave the perfunctory romance and almost too melodramatic ending.

I've said before in my previous review and I'll say it again: ""It's the Best South Korean Wuxia Swordplay Fantasy Adventure I've seen thus far!""...and I've seen them all.
Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]",1216425600,29,6583,4.900359066427289
