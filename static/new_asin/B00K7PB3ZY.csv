6404639,5,B00K7PB3ZY,"My Nightmares Have Become Reality!

A Haunting has been one of my favorites since the pilot, 'A Haunting in Connecticut' premiered back in 2002. I was shocked when season 6 ended on Oct 20th after only four episodes. You would think Destination America could have produced at least one more new episode for Halloween week.

So what's up with a four episode season? I dusted off my old ouija board and contacted a benign entity over at Destination America. I was told that the reason season six only had four episodes is because ratings for season five were lower than Destination America expected and they did not want to invest in a full season for season six. The good news is the ratings for season six were up and there will be a seventh season. A seventh season with...16 episodes!

I know what some of you are thinking, ""hasn't this idiot learned anything about the ouija board after watching six seasons of A Haunting?"" It's all good, it was only a benign entity. At least that's what she said and a malevolent entity wouldn't lie, right? She better not have been lying about season seven having 16 episodes.

The other good news is the release of this season six dvd. The four episodes: Marked By Evil, Well From Hell, Black Magic, and Haunted Victorian are presented in 1:78 anamorphic widescreen on a single dvd. All four episodes are creepy and up to the standards of the previous seasons.",1401494400,63,1400,4.633064516129032

6404683,3,B00K7PB3ZY,"I wish this had close captioning or English subtitles. As for the series itself, it is okay if you are fine with the alteration of the identity of the ""eye witnesses"" of the events.

But for me, changing the information regarding the incident like those who are involved makes you question the credibility of the events. Those may very well be a made up story.

Between this and Paranormal Witness, the latter is better in terms of contents and credibility than the former.",1446854400,,473,4.686746987951807

6404711,1,B00K7PB3ZY,I am so upset and completely disappointed! This so called season is on 1 disk with only 4 episodes on it. And what makes it worse is on the 3rd and 4th episodes it skips 10 sec to 10 mins all throughout the episode.

6404717,4,B00K7PB3ZY,"I've enjoyed every season of this series and season 6 is no exception. The set up and storytelling is very easy to follow and become involved in. The whole look and filming of it is good too. I've seen some 'haunting' recreations that are kind of cheesy, but these are nicely done. I also like the voice of the narrator.

The stories are scary and more interesting than those revolting slasher movies the movie industry constantly makes. Whats more is that these are based on true stories, which in my opinion, is much more terrifying.

I would have given this five stars except that I felt shortchanged this year by the amount of stories-only 4. Usually you get at least 15, and I enjoy every one of them.

Keep this great series going, Discovery channel, and I'll keep buying!",1425513600,2,778,4.58273381294964

6404728,5,B00K7PB3ZY,"Considering there are only four episodes you can't really call this a season. The four episodes are awesome though and it's only the price of a standard DVD so you're still getting your monies worth. Perfect for Halloween or if you're like me...every day is Halloween.

6404732,2,B00K7PB3ZY,"I can't believe there were only a few episodes for the entire season.  This was one of my favorite shows for the longest time, and I have all of the prior seasons, including all of the seasons for The Haunted.  This was so disappointing that I found myself losing interest in the stories. I am also very disappointed that the show will no longer use actual footage from the investigations, and will fabricate parts of the stories for entertainment purposes.  You don't have to fabricate a good haunting story, the true stories are spooky enough.  I am hoping that the show will redeem itself and become more honest again, the way that it used to be.  If you are super curious to see it because it was your favorite show, then do what I did, don't listen to the reviews and see it for yourself.  Otherwise, if you would rather save some money and space on your DVD shelf, don't bother.  Its not worth the money.",1412294400,3,910,4.445783132530121

I have all the seasons on DVD now and am anxiously awaiting the new season.  As with any shows of this type, viewers need to be aware that they aren't always as factual as you think and some evidence is contrived to make the episode appear more interesting.  That said, I've met several of the people featured in episodes of this show and they're genuine, down-to-earth people that have had extraordinary things happen to them.  Overall this is a great show although season 6 was somewhat shorter than most of the previous seasons it still had good episodes in it and worth buying for my collection.",1476230400,,715,4.650793650793651
