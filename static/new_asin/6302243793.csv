The only good thing about it is Dora's good  looks. Otherwise, don't bother.",932601600,3,254,5.0476190476190474

At the turn of the century there were terrorists with bombs, a magic called electricity and of course there was love, represented by twin sisters born - one a courtesan, the other a political feminist. It was a time when everything was black and white, the becoming of the 20th century. This movie does what movies are supposed to do - to make you dream and think and feel about our experiences on earth, and like great dreams you may not fully understand, until you reflect and see it again.

First time I saw this at the SF Film Fest was a 1989 preview. Ten minutes into it the projector shut down. ""We apologize but we started with the second reel first. We don't have enough time to show it now, but check back for a reschedule."" Talk about feeling confused and having low expectations with other films to see, for some reason I came back, I suppose to get my money's worth. Maybe it put the hook in me. So it opens with a dreamlike child's instrument playing, and stock footage of a circus entertainer putting his head in a canon, holding a torch to the fuse - all playing in reverse cycles. The film challenges you deceptively with old film tricks but they are well thought out. A modern director would plod the epic beginning - Edison's first public display of electric light. Enyedi, as light as a snowflake, directs us to the first magnificent scene set at night. People in period 1880's clothing see light bulbs for the first time. Playing Stars and Stripes, a band marches forward, mostly Negroes lit up, powered by a following horse-drawn cart holding Edison's sinister sounding generator. Electricity! By creative liberties the director swiftly takes us from New Jersey to Hungary, where twins are born to sell matches in the night snow only to be driven away by a constable. They huddle to strike a flame, curious innocent faces are brightened. Matches!

The director uses the spark of these twins and two different female natures advance us into the birth of the twentieth century. A must see for anyone who values cinema.",1371168000,3,2101,4.612299465240642
7823079,5,6302243793,"I don't write reviews very often, but I had to voice an opinion on this film.  It is one of the best films that I have ever seen.  It is visually rich, extremely intelligent, excellent production, and has some very profound moments.  I'll leave those unsaid for any future viewers to see with their own eyes.  To the first reviewer who gave this 1 star, you're just hopeless.  And to the comment on the film not addressing more of the 20th century, the reviewer completely missed the title of the film not to mention everything else.  It's not a documentary of the 20th century.  It's a beautifully rendered description of the idealism and reality that shaped the directors' world, namely Eastern Europe.  However, it's explorations apply on a much larger scale as they surpass purely political and historical concerns and approach a beautiful, even poetic visual statement of the human condition.  Don't be misguided, this movie is great.  There are scenes in this film that made me remember that magical feeling one had when one first saw the wonder of a 'movie' playing in front of one's eyes.",1229558400,5,1096,4.781914893617022
7823080,3,6302243793,"With a title like ""My Twentieth Century"" you would think the film would be about the twentieth century. Well it is and it isn't.

 The film was directed by Ildiko Enyedi (his debut film) and won the Cannes film festival's ""Camera d' or"".

 We follow two girls Dora and Lili (both played by the extremely beautiful Dortha Segda, who makes her debut here as well and might not be commonly known, is actually not Hungarian, she's Polish) who are sisters which were seperated at birth. Each girl takes a different path in life. Dora is a carefree lively spirit. Lili is very political and much more serious minded.

 Enyedi tells these characters stories as the twentieth century is taking shape. No ""defining"" moments of the century are presented as a backdrop of any event in these girls life but the movie does make some references to sex and politics.

 Besides Segda's performance, which is as pure as any you will ever see, the film doesn't quite reach the grand ambitious Enyedi has set for the film. Though it is not deserving of some of the comments it has been getting. If some people feel the movie takes on too much, that is the exact opposite reaction I had to the film. I thought it could have taken on more! Where were moments dealing with World War 1? And since this is a Hungarian film I thought there would be some mention of 56.

 What we seem to have here is yet again another case of people being a little ""tougher"" and critical of a film because it is Hungarian.

 Hungarian films aren't exactly sweeping across U.S. theatres. For some reason or other Eastern European films seem to have a difficult time getting distributed in this country, regardless of which country they are from.

 Some moments in ""My Twentieth Century"" are quite good. There are a few humorous moments, some wonderful cinematography and as I already mentioned Segda's performance is very impressive especially when you consider it was her first role.

 This is quite an ambitious film for a first timer. Much could have went wrong but Enyedi displays a good visual eye and demonstrates a clear understanding of how to tell an effective story. Sadly he hasn't done much which has caught the public's eye. He did direct a film called ""Simon magus "" (aka Simon the Magician) which managed to create some buzz.

 ""My Twentieth Century"" (aka Az en xx. szazadom) could have touched upon more moments in history and try to build that into the story but there are small delights to be found in this film if you are willing to look. Walk in with an open mind.

 Bottom-line: Ambitious film from first time director Ildiko Enyedi that doesn't go far enough. Needed to show us more of the twentieth century and its defining moments.",1169683200,,2712,4.633891213389122
7823081,5,6302243793,"I would just like to add that I found many of the scenes quite funny,  e.g. I particularly like the short sequence when the camera followed one of Pavlov's dogs on its adventures, after it escaped from the lab.

Edit (April 2011)...
 It's sad that this film has been out for  over 20 years  and it still hasn't been  offered on DVD.",1148947200,2,332,4.274193548387097
7823082,5,6302243793,"""My Twentieth Century"", is not a vulgarly prosaic film about human extremities amidst the grandiosity of technology, but of love amidst the ideological milieu that scientific acheivement engenders. If one can understand that woman/man is still the highest corporeal food in the universe this filmic ""gordian knot""  unravels easily. If one cannot understand this it is the result of an atrophying of the meaning of the ethereal for which the blame can be assigned not to science but, to that field of defiling abstractions called politics--of the 20th century kind.",1046304000,5,564,5.266666666666667
7823083,5,6302243793,"It was definitely an interesting experience first watching this film, the story involves two twin girls who are poor and destitute, who are taken and separated, Dorota Segda in the starring role as the late mother of the twin girls and the dual role of the twin girls, who live different but separate lives, one a frivolous woman of privilege and the other a disenfranchised revolutionary who unbeknownst to each other fall into a  love triangle with the same man and unbeknownst to him too.  The story takes at the begining of the industrial revolution, begins with the invention of the light bulb and ends with the invention of the telegraph, the director manages to intertwine the period history with the human story above, the cinematography I feel is awesome without having to be aware of it, and works great in black and white, so well that you would almost hate to see it colorized, if this ever comes out on DVD I'm definitely grabbing it..",1024099200,6,948,4.704819277108434
7823084,5,6302243793,"I was disturbed to see those reviews that considered only the pure sensousness of the film, as if its brilliance indicates a lack of greater purpose.  Don't let the incredible film sequencing and luminousity take  charge here--there is greater depth to the film than the gorgeous filmwork!  No, I don't understand all of this film yet, but it will be a wonderful  lifetime figuring it out--and I think that is essentially the tale that  this film tells.",960940800,10,453,4.8311688311688314
7823085,5,6302243793,"This jewel, shot in black and white, is visually stunning. The story is light-hearted and brimming with humor. The film represents the very definition of high-art. It will likely be recieved as frivolous and  nonsensical by the rigid and quasi-mature; however, open minds and free  spirits will return time and again to bask in the pure pleasure.",934761600,10,346,5.052631578947368
