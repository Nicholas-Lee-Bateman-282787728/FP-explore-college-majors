8308014,3,B001H5ZQFQ,"I really wanted something more substantial. The two songs covered ""A Little Bitter"" and ""Again"" are not even in my top 10 AIC tunes. What they call ""In Depth Bass Lessons"" is more like a basic overview. Basically, you can watch the entire thing on You Tube. Save yourself the pennies - watch it on line.",1372291200,,303,4.428571428571429
