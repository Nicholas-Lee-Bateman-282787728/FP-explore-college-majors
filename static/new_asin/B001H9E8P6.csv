8308153,5,B001H9E8P6,"Along with the other stories on this DVD, the Fritz stories are classics that you will never forget.  I know because they are about me.  Over the years, I've had people from all over the world asking me if these stories really happened to me.  Yes they have!  You will enjoy each one of these stories of some of the most hilarious moments in my walk with the Lord.  Rev. Jesse Duplantis shares these with his unique style and flavor. Be sure to check out more of the Merry Heart DVD series.

When I get to Heaven, I'm sure the Lord and the angels will be smiling at me and thanking me for even bringing laughter in the Throne Room!  I hope you enjoy them all and allow the Joy of the Lord to bring healing to your spirit, soul and body.

Boss (Jesse), it has been a real blessing working for you over 30 years.  May we continue to cause joy for others.  Fritz Brown",1403049600,,865,4.156626506024097
