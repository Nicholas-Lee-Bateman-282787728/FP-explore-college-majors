7921187,2,B00004RESP,"With their renewed vigor and new champion, WCW had one last chance to turn it l around; unfortunately, they botched it and nosedived YET AGAIN! Besides Booker T the only new face that started creeping into the main event was Scott Steiner, and that simply wasn't enough. For an event called New Blood Rising, there seemed to be little new blood floating at the top where guys like Nash, Sid and Hogan were sitting comfortably.

Luckily, some things were going well and the new additions to the main event were helping to make the product bearable. The main event is a Bash at the Beach rematch between Booker T and Jarrett. It lives up to their previous encounter. The opening ladder match also stands out, though it would be outdone by year's end.

The rest of the card is mostly filler and several talented wrestlers like the Great Muta and Billy Kidman feel wasted in perfunctory matches or trashy feuds. I did enjoy seeing Vampiro and Muta winning gold, but that doesn't rescue a flat card. The 3-Way match between Steiner, Goldberg, and Nash may be one of the worst matches of the entire year. The booking, which intentionally breaks kayfabe, is such a glaring slap in the face that it bogs down everything for the main event.

There's a lot to hate about this card (I didn't even mention Judy Bagwell!), but the opener and main event help drag it from the dung heap to make only mildly offensive.",1407024000,,1402,4.6
7921188,3,B00004RESP,"Thanks to a free internet download (sue me), I found this old event from WCW's final year in New Blood Rising 2000.  This event came after the controversial Bash At The Beach PPV where Booker T won the WCW Championship from Jeff Jarrett in a last minute match setting up Jarrett's rematch here.  Also at the previous PPV, Scott Steiner turned on Kevin Nash to help Goldberg defeat him setting up this 3 way match with the winner becoming the new #1 contender to the WCW Title but this rivalry between all three became more personal with the shoot interviews all of them did on TV where they all promised to not be ""very professional"" while the head writer of WCW, Vince Russo, openly admitted that he didn't like one of the three participants in this match & what was going to happen was going to be what's best for business.  It should also be noted that this PPV took place in Canada during the period where Lance Storm debuted in WCW a month earlier & within that time captured 3 championships (U.S., Hardcore, Crusierweight) only for him to rename the championships in reference to & showing a heavy bias towards his country of Canada so he was coming into this event as a hometown hero (think Bret Hart in 1997).

Ladder Match: Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - The rules for this ladder match was that both 3 Count's golden record & their recording contract must be taken to win the match while it should be noted during this time that former MMA competitor Tank Abbott was playing a role of the biggest 3 Count fan including wearing their shirts & dancing while they perform while Evan came into this match with a brace on his ankle from injuring it in another ladder match on Nitro a short time earlier (which is available on ""Best Of WCW Nitro"" DVD). Knowing that both teams in this match were high flying crusierweights, we got a bunch of various spots & moments throughout the match such as Yang backdropping Shannon onto a ladder, Kaz slammed on top of Jamieson on the ladder straddled in the corner, Jamieson's giant leap off a ladder onto 3 Count on the floor, the various unique ways of knocking someone off the ladder including a neckbreaker & vertical suplex, Kaz being powerslammed on a ladder, dual splashes by the Dragons off ladders onto Shannon before he was later powerbombed off a ladder. This match topped their previous ladder match on Nitro only for them to continue to top this with their ladder match at Starrcade months later but this match definitely stole the show at this PPV.

The Cat vs. Great Muta - For those who don't remember, The Cat was the WCW Commissioner at the time & had a meeting with the Filthy Animals before the match making a deal where they guaranteed him a victory.  Muta kept out-wrestling Cat causing him to resort to going to the outside & fight out there only to regain the advantage & lose it because he kept showing off.  This was one of those matches that was just there, a sad waste of Muta, and turned out to be more about the deal he made with the Animals for later on in the night.

Judy Bagwell On A Forklit Match: Buff Bagwell vs. Positively Kanyon - It was during this time that Chris Kanyon's persona was a clone of Dallas Page & he wanted Buff's mother as he wanted Buff's mother as his ""Kimberly.""  Both men started the match fighting in the crowd before coming back into the ring trading momentum & even got a special appearance from former WCW Champion David Arquette.  This was a nice average match.

WCW Tag Team Champions Kronik vs. Misfits In Action vs. Perfect Event vs. Mark Jindrax & Sean O'Haire - The deal the Filthy Animals made with The Cat earlier in the night played out here as they were not only the special referees for this match but also getting a title shot against whoever the champions are the next night on Nitro.  Knowing those stipulations are were in place, this match completely revolved around the Animals as they would would heavily favor the rookie team of Jindrax & O'Haire throughout the match by attacking the other teams whenever they went to the outside with Disqo (the in-ring ref.) slow counting the other teams pinfall attempts & even Tygress getting in a bronco buster.  With Konnan on commentary along with all the other silliness involving the Animals throughout the match along with another team who Kronik had issues with getting involved, it wasn't much as far as wrestling quality goes but it did entertain me.

Strap Match: Billy Kidman vs. Shane Douglas - This match revolved around not only the woman who left Kidman & joined up with Douglas in Torrie Wilson but also a heavy amount of ""personal"" tapes that led to Scott Hudson having the line of the night, ""They've had more direct to video releases than Shannon Tweed.""  Both men fought along with outside with Kidman using the ringpost & strap to not only choke & low blow Douglas but also give Torrie a few whips with it as well as Douglas would also use the strap to hand out a few lashings.  This was another match that was good but the aftermath was interesting as it would also start up the feud between Vito & Reno.

R.O.T.C. (Rip Off The Camouflage) Match: Major Gunns vs. Ms. Hancock - This was the monthly ""T&A"" match with the females where during the match you had to strip the other girl of her clothes down to her bra & panties before winning the match by pinfall but to go along with the R.O.T.C. theme, the girls wore camouflage & there was a mudpit at ringside.  This was exactly what you expected under these conditions being a catfight mixed in with the girls stripping each other while the announcers got their perverted jokes in but there was a bigger story here as this match was the eventual end of the Ms. Hancock character in favor or her real name, Stacy Keibler, due to the issues her her having stomach pains throughout & after the match.

Sting vs. The Demon - After Vampiro defeated The Demon in a Graveyard Match at the previous PPV with Sting returning later that night, The Demon joined Vampiro's ""Dark Carnival"" faction setting up this match against Sting.  To be honest, it took you longer to read what I just wrote about how this match got setup than the actual match itself as Sting squashed him in under a minute with the only important spot being what happened afterwords & earlier in the night to setup another match later in the night.

WCW United States Champion Lance Storm vs. Mike Awesome - This match was a rematch from the tournament where Storm defeated Awesome for the title weeks earlier but Storm himself also named a special outside referee in Jacques Rouqeau (WWE's The Mountie, Fabulous Rouqueau Brothers, Qubeckers/Amazing French Canadians) to enforce the ""Canadian Rulebook"" that he had been using in his title defenses since winning & renaming the championships.  This was another case where they could have had a good quality match but it was overbooked with silliness as the rules of the match kept changing every single time Awesome had the match won from a different count for a pin instead of a 3 (you would have thought King Kong Bundy wrote that rule), eliminating the different ways to win the match, and the rules changing to the point where it was a glorified Texas Death Match.  This didn't get over the crowd at all as Lance (despite being the heel) was the hometown hero yet he kept getting beat only for them to keep the act up of changing the rules to the point where they chanted ""Bulls..."" & the only thing that saved this segment for the audience was the appearance of another Canadian legend afterwords.

WCW Tag Team Champions Kronik vs. Vampiro & Great Muta - With both teams getting involved in each other's matches throughout the match, this match was setup in what was a nice back & forth encounter with Kronik showcasing their dominate power while the Dark Carnival wrestled more focusing on the legs while double teaming whenever they could however the biggest story here (notice a pattern of this throughout this entire show) was the return of two men who claimed to be the most dominate team in WCW before Kronik ever appeared on the scene.

Kevin Nash vs. Goldberg vs. Scott Steiner - The announcers mentioned the fact that throughout the night, Goldberg had a motorcycle accident & hadn't arrived to the building yet which was teased even more when his entrance music kept playing only with him not coming out leading to even Nash getting frustrated demanding they ""cut it!"" but Goldberg would eventually show up with his ribs taped & went right for Nash with Steiner getting his shots in on both men when he could.  The announce team throughout the match kept alluding to the fact that what was going on was possibly a ""shoot"" & this really came to pass when Nash set Goldberg up for the powerbomb only for him to shove Nash off & walk away with Nash looking confused while Russo came out demanding Goldberg get back in the ring with Goldberg's reaction being ""F.U.""  The match continued on between Steiner & Nash while Steiner's freak Madajah made a return & got involved in the match as well but all of this was just backdrop to everything happening between Goldberg & Russo as the announcers kept pulling the fact that Nash & Steiner were working ""on the fly"" while burying Goldberg for doing what he did.

WCW Champion Booker T vs. Jeff Jarrett - Booker T came into the match with a bad knee due to Jarrett attacking it earlier in the night & Jarrett continued to target that knee & was relentless by using the guardrail, stomps, and even the boston crab at one point.  He was hopping on one leg but Booker was still able to start mounting somewhat of a comeback with moves like the axe kick but ended up getting a guitar shot right to the knee followed by a figure four.  With the referees getting knocked out one after another while both men taking some hard hits of their own from a Book End off the apron through a table & The Stroke onto a chair, this was a hard fought match just like their previous encounter only this one was overshadowed by the earlier controversy.

This PPV was the typical ""Vince Russo"" booking during this time as there was a bunch of faults here.  They had too many matches on the card (11 total) causing a majority of the matches to be kept very short to the point where Sting only wrestled for 1 min. while a high majority of the matches were either there to pushing other storylines or be overbooked with silly gimmicks or stipulations.  Most of the matches were good for what they were & the actions wasn't TOO out of control unlike previous PPV's during Russo's time in WCW but this was really lacking high in-ring quality action so unless you were a fan of this period of WCW, you aren't missing anything as this was more of a 3 hour edition of Nitro.",1339545600,2,10742,4.537745604963805
7921189,4,B00004RESP,"The 6 man tag team Ladder match between 3 Count(Evan Karagias,Shannon Moore & Shane Helms) & The Jung Dragons(Kaz Hayashi,Jamie-San & Yun Yang) was the showstealer of this PPV. The Ernest Miller-Great Muta match was not great but pretty good. The Judy Bagwell on a Folklift match between Buff Bagwell & Kanyon while the wrestling was good,it was still crud. The 4 corners match for the world tag team title was a pretty solid bout for a 4 corners match. The Strap match between Billy Kidman & Shane Douglas was so-so at best. The Rip off the Clothes/Mud pit match between Major Gunns & Ms. Hancock was sloppy,messy & had eighth-rate wrestling. The Sting-The Demon match was a 52 second stink-fest. The Canadian Rules match for the US tile between Lance Strom & Mike Awesome was a pretty good ruined by the ""rules"". The Vampiro/Great Muta-Kronik(Brain Adams & Bryan Clark)match for the world tag team titles was nothing more then a last minute filler. The Kevin Nash-Goldberg-Scott Steiner 3 way bout was pretty good and could have done alot better without Goldberg walking out on the match. The Booker T-Jeff Jarrett World title match was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth brawl. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1279670400,,1206,4.830917874396135
7921190,3,B00004RESP,"When vince russo took over wcw in late 1999 things wernt looking good. And up untill new blood rising they went that great but on this show there is some good stuff.

7921191,4,B00004RESP,"WCW New Blood Rising was definately not the best pay-per-view of the year, however was very entertaining. The opening contest is a ladder match between the jung dragons and three count. this match kicks (...). Another great match is the WCW Title match between Booker T. and Jeff Jarrett. You will also see Goldberg walk out and ""shoot"" on Vince Russo and Stacy Keibler vs Major Gunns in a ROTC match. Definately recommended for the entertainment.",1007164800,,447,4.894736842105263
7921192,2,B00004RESP,"Except for the main event this is just an all around crappy PPV. The Sting vs. Demon match is terrible as are the tag matches. The ladder match is great. The 3 way to be #1 contender is boring and has a dumb ending. The US title match would have been great if Mike Awesome would have gotten the win, but Vince Russo decided to make it a comedy match. Jarrett's match is great as always, but he should've won. Vince Russo's worst PPV EVER!!",993081600,2,439,4.176470588235294

The triple threat ladder match was amazing and the Lance Storm vs. Mike Awesome match was hilarious.

It was really cool when the rock and jericho beat the hell out of kronic to win the tag titles.
