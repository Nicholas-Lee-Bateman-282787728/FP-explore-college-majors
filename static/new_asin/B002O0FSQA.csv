8375714,2,B002O0FSQA,"This movie is divided in 3 different stories that don't quite make sense of what the tittle suppose to be. The first 2 episodes are in black and white and the last one is on full color that they all took place back in the early 1900s. This is not a movie you want to own. The whole plot of the movie is quite boring.
The only thing that I can say about this film is that I finally get to see the full naked rear side of one of my favorite Mexican actress, Ana Claudia Talancon, but that is all I can say I found interesting on this film. If you want to buy interesting Mexican films, buy ""El Tigre de Santa Julia"" or ""Matando Cabos"" or if you are a fan of Ana Claudia Talancon, buy ""Ladies Night"" and ""Love in the time of Cholera"". Not this one.",1277424000,8,745,3.973333333333333
