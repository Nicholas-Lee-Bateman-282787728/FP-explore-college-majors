996006,5,6305240671,"I watched the video 3 times in a row.  The movie felt so right to me the 1st time, but the 2nd and 3rd viewings revealed the seamlessly woven visual, musical and plot threads that, taken together, caused me to  conclude that the only way a film could be this good was if it was crafted  with love and integrity.  Realistic, touching portrayal of the vicissitudes  of life in the relationship arena, with a nod in the direction of the  almost mystical impact of destiny.  Usually when a reviewer says a movive  is a feel-good movie, it suggests a certain superficiality or lightness  that makes is hard to take such a movie seriously, or you feel insulted by  the movie because it is so formulaic and predictable.  At the end of this  movie you feel good because the male and female leads arrive at their  happiness by having the guts to keep on living their lives in the face of  all the hurts and disappointments of life, and the general insanity of  urban life in particular. Just by having the perseverance to keep on  getting up each day and doing their lives, eventually the sun breaks  through and they discover each other.  The music was great, the portrayal  of the Boston setting was accurate, superb, and the acting was, across the  board, convincing and just-right in emotional tone.  Hope Davis was great,  as was her Brazilian suitor.  See it.  You'll like it.",928713600,3,1373,4.578512396694215
996162,5,6305240671,"I watched this movie in its original theatrical release.  I live in the greater Boston area, and I think the film deftly captures a batch of the things that a person can adore about greater Boston, along with the things that drive you up the wall.  It rewards close attention -- Hope Davis is magnificent as one of the few deeply introverted romantic leads that I can remember.  The rest of the cast is uniformly terrific from top to bottom, the situations about dating hell are wonderful, and the footage of the New England Aquarium is, well, depressing (after a big renovation project, not much looks all that different).  And yes, that's a young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the irritatingly self-righteous ex.  It offers a slice of life of Boston in the '90s (complete with a bar run by Jimmy Tingle), and remains one of my sentimental favorites.",1445644800,2,847,4.695945945945946

996165,4,6305240671,"Caveat, I am a romantic comedy fan.
This is one of three movies, from the late 1990's that were wonderful and clever stories and totally overlooked by the general public.  I don't think any of them had a general release.  The only reason I found them, I was working at Blockbuster my junior year in college and we got to check out movies for free.
The ""secret"" rendezvous scene was my favorite scene.
Hope Davis' career was at it's high point.  Philip Seymour Hoffman turns in a good performance, before he became famous.  Alan Gelfant puzzles me, he did a very credible performance, but his career never really took off.  I could see him stepping into the ""everyman"" role played by Bill Pullman or Jeff Daniels.",1426032000,4,712,4.619047619047619

996170,4,6305240671,i love the actress that plays the main character. I always find her believable in whatever character she plays.

996281,4,6305240671,"This is a charmingly wise and funny film satirizing the opportunism and goofiness of the commercial dating scene, the sorrows stirred by fast-track romance, the rewards from tracking work you truly want to do, and the curve-balls thrown by random encounters that offer more than you ever thought you could gain through systematically planned intentions.

I had copied this on EP (long play) VHS tape several years back, and reviewing the tape on Augut 2nd, saw that it looked pretty scratchy on my 60"" HDTV.
I felt pretty bad about that because I had invited some friends over to view it on August 8th.

On August 2nd I made haste to order it through a 3rd party at Amazon and made a special request to the 3rd party at ""Lotsa Movies"" to expedite the delivery by August 7th, if at all possible. (I had paid $2.00 beyond the regular rate to attempt facilitating that time period.)

--A lovely man  named Cliff at ""Lotsa Movies"" responded to me with a remarkable e-mail to reassure me that he would do everything possible to get it to me via priority mail as well as check the tracking information to confirm delivery no later than August 7.
--All that attention to an unknown customer buying from his service a $5.99 VHS tape!!!

I cannot level enough thanks and praise upon this man and the ""Lotsa Movies"" outfit!

He plays the live-in companion that breaks up with Hope Davis.  We see him two times, and not for long.  I won't be watching this again.  I found it disappointing and dull.  He certainly does not ""star"" in this.

An attractive, competent nurse (Hope Davis) and her off-beat live-in boyfriend break up. Her mother puts an ad in the dating section of the paper for her, and when she sees the volume of answers decides to give it a try.  She meets a series of incompatabilities.  She is dull herself.

996364,5,6305240671,"The past two decades have seen a slew of alleged romantic comedies that are neither, just a formulaic collection of cliches & crudity. What a pleasure, then, to realize that it's still possible to make a genuine romantic comedy with all the charm & wit that used to be found in such films! True, this film is now some 15+ years old; but it remains as fresh & delightful as the first time I saw it when it originally appeared.

An early film for Hope Davis, she shines in this story of a young woman who has pretty much sworn off finding a decent romantic partner after her relationship with an overly earnest political activist (a then-unknown Philip Seymour Hoffman) falls apart. Her too-helpful mother (the wonderful Holland Taylor) decides to fix that by placing a personal ad for her daughter in the local paper -- and the next thing she knows, there are 64 messages from a mixed bag of would-be suitors ... or is that the bottom of the bag?

At the same time, an aspiring marine biologist (Alan Gelfant) working in a Boston aquarium is trying to get his own life in order ... and it's equally frustrating & funny to see how our two leads keep missing each other by a fraction of a second throughout the film, as they're clearly perfect for each other. I'd call it ""quirky"" if not for the downside of the word, which can sometimes equal ""thin & badly plotted"" -- though that's not the case here.

If anything, the film has a somewhat wistful, melancholy undercurrent, one that asks questions about destiny (or the lack thereof), the possibility of finding meaningful love that'll stand the test of everyday life, and that elusive search for real depth in one's life. Our heroine's late father gave her good advice which the viewer should take to heart: ""Try to contemplate one beautiful thing every day."" How many of us do that? How many of us even consider the possibility?

I've found this to be a very rewatchable film over the years, one that's just as appealing & thoughtful on the 20th viewing as on the first. Why can't Hollywood learn from a film like this & rediscover the art of making romantic comedies that are for genuine grownups, not perpetual adolescents? Highly & happily recommended!",1384128000,7,2205,4.61734693877551

It doesn't show men in a good light and that's why I would classify it as a ""chic film"" even though it was aptly directed by a man, Brad Anderson. It's funny and a very enjoyable comedy. It's also a good training film for the guys and how to behave when going on a blind date. When a decent chap comes along that can take his eyes of off himself and truly get involved in the conversation, then any woman would light up, even Hope Davis. IF all the men characters weren't all portrayed as egotistical self-absorbed juveniles then I could rate it 4 stars. It's a delightful comedy regardless.",1365465600,,695,4.3538461538461535

996510,2,6305240671,"Love this indie movie.

This review is solely in regard to the QUALITY of this newest (2011/2012) DVD release.  As I own the previous release from the same studio and have compared them.

In comparison, this newest DVD is 1) four full minutes shorter than the other version, which my DVD player's graphics proved after checking both DVDs on it, and which also can be seen in the 92-minute running time printed on the package of this newest version vs. the 96 minutes printed on the package of the older version (I haven't checked WHERE the footage is missing, but it's definitely not in the opening or closing credits being expanded or reduced, but elsewhere).

2) This new DVD had 10 haphazardly started/ended ""chapters"" which start in really odd places--always in the middle of scenes!  And on the disc's menu, believe it or not, they are listed merely as ""Chapter One"", ""Chapter Two,"" etc., with NO other info-- no names for the scenes, no pictures . . .  Whereas on the preferred older DVD release, the menu for the chapters is a very fancy one, in the form of a train line map, and with a name for each chapter and a photo for each chapter.  FAR better than the new 2011/2012 DVD release.  The older DVD's chapters also start and end in logical, proper places.

The film's print is identical on the old and the new DVDs, also it's the same aspect ratio: 1.85:1 and enhanced for 16:9 TVs.  It's sad that no improvement was made to the picture quality, but to be fair, it was excellent on both old and new versions, despite a bit of tiny squigglies in the backgrounds of both if one pays close attention.

Even the older clamshell case is hard, whereas the new one's is soft, despite also being plastic.

Buy the OLDER version of this DVD release, which is better in ALL ways.",1357776000,10,1779,4.507788161993769
996511,3,6305240671,"This is another chapter I guess in a series of films about quirky romances that I've been watching lately.  I should have been aware that this film was directed before Brad Anderson directed ""Happy Accidents.""  I didn't particularly like that film.  While there are similar themes, this one is marginally better thanks to a believable Hope Davis (TV's ""The Newsroom"").

She plays Erin, a nurse at a Boston hospital.  She is constantly being chastised by her mother, played by Holland Taylor - who is the real life aunt of Anderson - for dropping out of medical school.  Erin is summarily dumped by her boyfriend (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a political activist.  One of the interesting pieces of the story is that Erin, while crushed by her boyfriend's departure, is more or less content being alone.  As she tells people, she's alone, not lonely.  Whether at home or in a bar, she's not ready to play the ""game"" any time soon.

Unfortunately her mother wants her out looking again and runs a personal ad in a local paper.  Erin decides what the hell and starts screening the ""applicants"" by phone before going on several introductions held in her favorite bar.  While all this is going on, a plumber studying to be a marine biologist (Alan Gelfant) keeps crossing paths with Erin, although for the most part they are unaware of each other at the time.  This will obviously change before the movie is over.

This film has a solid premise and moves along nicely.  And while Davis does a good job, her character becomes a bit tiresome after a while.  Alan, the plumber/marine biologist is the most likable character here but Gelfant's performance leaves much to be desired.  This is a modestly entertaining and ultimately forgettable film.",1352332800,2,1736,4.830508474576271
996512,5,6305240671,I've always loved this movie. If you are from Boston and like the documentary sort of way it's filmed you'll enjoy this. Very sweet and the main character is a woman many of us share common feelings with.,1338768000,,204,4.394736842105263
996513,5,6305240671,"I love this movie and I also bought the soundtrack which features Brazilian Bossa Nova music from Antonio Carlos Jobim.

What's not to love about a love story.  First she gets dumped, then her mother puts an outrageously inaccurate love line ad in the newspaper.  Wisely, she is curious and  decides to see what's out there.  Of course, they are all losers but she's always sooo close to The One.

Hope Davis is one of my favorite stars and she is at her best here.  Smart, funny, learning to become content within herself and then ... they finally meet on the subway whose next stop is Wonderland.",1335225600,,598,4.5327102803738315
996514,4,6305240671,"I didn't know what to think of this movie the first 20 minutes I began watching it, but it hooked me quickly.  Sure, it has the Sleepless in Seattle type ending but, along the way, we get more depth of character and, for those of us who are now out of the meat market, a brusher up course on what it was like to go out on highly unsuccessful dates in our search for Mr. Right.  Hope Davis is wonderful as Erin because she is smart, funny, sad, and all those elements combined along with her love of Brazilian music show the romantic she is at heart once she comes across the right man.  Alan is likable and funny as he struggles with the overly enthusiastic affections of a fellow student.  This movie is not only witty and fresh, but it is a more realistic portrayal of the dating world than most, and it's got the added plus of having one of the most romantic soundtracks to enhance the overall effect.  It just goes to show that anywhere in the world can have the ambiance of Brazil if you have the right partner.",1330041600,,1016,4.243523316062176

996610,5,6305240671,"Full disclosure: I HATE chick flicks. I'll watch them with my wife if she watches a slasher movie with me in trade, so I rarely watch them!
This movie is excellent. If you'd like to put it in the chick flick chum bucket, go ahead, but you'd be doing it a disservice. And finally someone quotes that it is a foolish consistency that is the hobgoblin of little minds. I felt stunning relief when someone finally made the distinction! Thant the film's writers for their literary accuracy and weaving it in as a plot device.
The cast is terrific, the setting is Boston, and shot wonderfully, and the narrative arc of two people who finally meet sustains our interest throughout.
Next Stop Wonderland juxtaposes the story of Alan (Alan Gelfant, who is excellent and sympathetic), a plumber struggling to get a college degree as a marine biologist to escape being a plumber, or typed as a plumber. Against his story is the story of Erin, who has dropped out of Harvard Medical School and is working as a Nurse, not even a full RN, and is adrift from too loose of a ""relationship"" with her ideologue guy pal who is absent for ""the cause"" all the time.
[Spoiler alert!!!!, skip this sentence]  The movie's  theme is fate and destiny, so at the end Erin and Alan meet--but the fun is in getting there.
 The writing and dialogue is clever and believable, and the movie is worth watching just for the horrible series of ""dates"" from personal ads alone. Alan struggles with an infatuated undergrad who is trying to simultaneously slum it with him and use him to pass biology (he is the best student in the class).
But the best part is every single actor in this marvelous film is so believable. There isn't a single false note or miscasting, this is an astonishing achievement. Alan Gelfant is especially engaging in his aquarium aspirations subplot and its concomitant frustrations. Philip Seymour Hoffman takes a walk-on, walk-off character that could have been cardboard radical activist and puts his twist on it. H. Jon Benjamin is hilarious as one of Erin's bizarre blind dates. Holland Taylor brings a brittle oversexed quirkiness (she boinks her driver for a free ride from the airport) Momster in her role as Erin's mother. Roger Rees is hilarious as a sleazy predator as the biology teacher we've seen on every college campus.
But hands down Hope Davis as Erin is simply excellent. This was a role either written for her, or she just played herself, or she is the most brilliant actress on the planet.",1320278400,2,2498,4.698630136986301

However (and this is a relief) there are no screaming cliches in this movie. Even the buttheads have a certain charm about themselves, in that they mean no real harm. Oh, well, maybe there are a couple of stereotypes, now that I think about it. Those would be the flabby environmentalist who doesn't know who he is, and the dastardly developer bent on bespoiling the waterfront. But hey!

Recently dumped (again) by Hoffman's character, Davis is depressed & angry at the bottom feeders she is forced to endure on endless blind dates culled from the respondents to a personal ad placed by her witty, vivacious, successful mother, played to perfection by Taylor Holland.  In this parallel story telling technique - On the other side of the bar is Alan Gelfant, who is just a guy trying to make a career leap from plumber to marine biologist.

996616,5,6305240671,"11 years on, this movie is mostly of interest because of the small role played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  As usual, he turns a bit part into something much, much more.

But beyond that historical artifact, 'Wonderland' is wonderful.  It's well-written, well-acted and downright, laugh-out-loud funny in many spots, but not in a slapstick way.  The movie has added thrills for a native Bostonian like me.  While it's not steeped in 'Boston-alia' like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001ZX0OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)</a>, it has some delightful hooks, like the use of the T's Blue Line (from which it derives its neat movie title), the New England Aquarium (site of many school trips in my youth) and the Wonderland race track (""And there goes Swifty!"").

My only gripe: the coverbox.  It has nothing to do with the movie itself.  Hope Davis is pictured smiling impishly in a revealing, skimpy dress.  As viewers of the movie know, Ms. Davis' character doesn't crack a smile until the end, and she's in no mood to wear a dress like that. This isn't as bad as the cover art of such marketing inanities like the totally misleading packaging of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Star-Maker/dp/B00007K02I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Star Maker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/East-Is-East/dp/B00004UCHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">East Is East</a>, but this is still another example of marketers trying to dress-up a movie into something that its not.

Her story is paralleled with that of a charming and unassuming single fellow (Alan Gelfant) who aspires to become a marine biologist. Both parties find themselves politely deferring to well-meaning friends and relatives who are constantly trying to fix them up with dates.

996701,4,6305240671,"Hope Davis has become what I like to call a hidden success. Her movies don't make a gazillion dollars at the box office and you'd probably hardly notice her if she passed you on the street. But what she does -- and does well -- is create lovable and memorable characters on celluloid. Most recently she was paired with Greg Kinnear in THE MATADOR, a role in which her underused talents still shone brightly with every scene she appeared.

I decided to watch NEXT STOP WONDERLAND for the sole purpose of checking to see how well Mrs. Davis stood as an actress in a starring role. I wasn't disappointed.

The story is that of a nurse named Erin (Davis) who comes home one day to find her boyfriend, Sean (Philip Seymour Hoffman, CAPOTE) moving out. Angry and spiteful, Erin quickly decides that being alone is okay. In fact, she firmly entrenches the philosophy of aloneness within herself ...until...

Erin's domineering mother, Piper (Holland Taylor, THE TRUMAN SHOW), discovers her daughter's recent break-up and places a personals ad in the newspaper for her. Initially upset by this, Erin eventually decides to take on the task of dismissing all of the loathsome men who try to court her. The comedy here is striking and philosophical as the men do whatever they can to get into her pants only to be rebuffed by Erin's formidable intellect.

On the other side of Boston (where this story takes place) we find Alan Monteiro (Alan Gelfant, TURN OF FAITH), a plumber turned marine biologist who volunteers at the local aquarium. He's struggling with debt, school (still working on his biology degree), and an aggressive younger classman who's infatuated with him. Strangely enough, too, is the fact that his brother is one of the guy's trying to bed Erin via the personals ad.

As Erin and Alan mingle within their own circles, they come close to orbiting one another but never quite make contact. Brief glances, telephone calls that pass them by, invitations to the same restaurant parties, the two seemed destined to fall into one another's arms ...yet these encounters slip past. It's wonderfully frustrating to watch, and these ""almost encounters"" are never forced.

But in the end, director Brad Anderson doesn't let us down. Serendipity intervenes and the two strangers end up hugging one another on a transit train after a strange set of circumstances pulls them together.

Romantic comedies are okay if done right. You know the type that kind of make you feel, eh, just okay; You've Got Mail, Pretty Woman, Sleepless In Seattle. But this flick gives you more for less. Made as an independent film on a $1 million budget, Hope Davis' excellent acting and the perfect script make for some thought-provoking and downright funny moments. While those other RomComs I mentioned have a basic ""feel-good"" to them, NEXT STOP WONDERLAND has much more. The philosophy, romance, and comedy all build to a very satisfying conclusion and one that will invite discussions about the probabilities of fate versus happenstance.",1153612800,12,3017,4.927165354330708
996702,5,6305240671,"Great romantic comedy about fate, relationships, and what makes two people right for each other. Hope Davis plays Erin, a nurse in Boston who is mourning the loss of her relationship with her eco-activist on-again off-again boyfriend. He's left her many times before, but this time vows this is the final send-off. Leaving with their futon strapped to his car, Erin retreats into the comfort of solitude, listening to the wonderful Bossa Nova of Jobim, and reading her father's poetry. In another part of the city, Alan, played by Alan Gelfant with an easy-going, likeability, is a 35-year old plumber who's going to school to become a marine biologist. Not wanting to fall into the bland stability of the plumbing business, Alan wants to make a better life for himself, one that is both meaningful and that he's passionate about. It's both Alan and Erin's journeys of self-discovery, trying to control their own destinies, that makes their paths cross, again and again, so that the film becomes a question of fate vs. the ability to choose. The film raises this question many times, from Erin's decision to go on dates with several men who have responded to her personal ad (one of the most hilarious sequences of the film), to Alan's decision to steal the Boston Aquarium's mascot blowfish, Puff, in an effort to get the local ""lender"", from whom he's borrowed money for school, off his back. If it sounds like the stories of Alan and Erin seem like two different movies, don't despair. The filmmaker and co-screenwriter, Brad Anderson, has very seamlessly and cleverly interwoven the stories so that when they ultimately meet, it's not only believable, but we realize that it must be fate.",1125100800,2,1692,4.898954703832753

In some ways it's tough for me to really define the movie or the characters & I don't want to give it all away.  Erin struggles to overcome some of the losses in her life and to find a way to move forward while Alan is an individual who fights to fulfill his dreams, which he figured out later on in his own life, while maintaining his integrity.  But the movie is so full of coincidences and near misses for these two very honest individuals that you are left waiting for the moment when they come together, and when they do, it is actually just the right time.  From the dating service, to Alan seeing her while in the fish tank, to the photographer putting her in the picture... there are so many things in this movie that you may have missed after seeing it the first time that you'll catch the next few times around.

I definitely recommend the movie.  I love it.  Can't say that enough.  And it takes place in Boston, and you get a good view of some of the sights and places in Boston.  I've actually been the the Burren & still sometimes hang out in the Somerville/Cambridge area.  And the New England Aquarium really has been renovated since then (1998) and is off of the Blue Line (the Wonderland stop is actually the last stop on the Blue Line - there's your symbolism!).

I also love the movie because the soundtrack, done by Claudio Ragazzi and Arto Lindsay, is nothing short of stellar.  The original score perfectly fits the mood of the CD for both characters and other than the classic Bossa Nova by Elis Regina and Astrud Gilberto, you have some very nice works by Bebel Gilberto (daughter of Miucha and Joao Gilberto) before her feature album came out, that I haven't seen her release elsewhere, including a sensational version of ""One Note Samba/Girl from Ipanema"" with the amazing work of Vinicius Cantuaria.",1123804800,12,2087,4.401041666666667

996705,5,6305240671,"Once in awhile I come apon a small film (no huge stars, big budgets or special effects), that grabs my attention and just takes me away to another place. The end result is just a good feeling as the final credits roll. The small, romantic comedy ""Next Stop Wonderland"" is one of those movies. The film takes place in Boston. We are witness to Erin (a very good Hope Davis) being dumped on her own inner city door step by her flakey enviormentalist, activist boyfriend (the always amazing, Phillip Seymour Hoffman). This mid thirties, registered nurse is pretty, smart, intellectual and quite cynical about her relationships with people and especially the opposite sex. This is born out, when her busy-body mother (Holland Taylor) puts a 'personals ad' in a local paper for her. We watch as Erin has a series of 'dates' at the same bar with the rather loathsome respondants, who have no chance, when they try to make small talk, use their best lines and try to match wits with this verbally adept, cynical women. Simultaneously we also meet Alan (Alan Galfant), a former plumber, who is making a mid life career change by going to school full time to become a marine biologist. He is trying to stay on a straight and narrow path by studying hard. Unfortunately he gets in trouble with some loansharks, who are also involved in some controversial dealings with the local aquarium. Alan, who also happens to do an internship at the aquarium, is called apon by the loansharks for a special 'favor' to repay his debt. In a way this movie is really about how much fate & chance play in our lives and relationships. Several characters have out and out discussions about the subject. We watch as Erin & Alan's lives in one way or another, unknowingly intersect in many rather interesting ways, without the two ever meeting each other. Yes, we all know what's going to eventually happen by the end of the film between these two  lost souls. But that isn't really a big deal. The fun of the movie is watching them get to that moment! On paper these two plotlines (the woman on endless bad dates & the guy in hock to gangsters) might sound a bit old and hokey. But Director/Writer, Brad Anderson's script seems fresh, quite witty and even downright philosophical in it's dialogue and presentation. The cast of this film is uniformly excellent. Hope Davis presents Erin as such an interesting yet flawed woman. You just wish you could have the chance of being one of those lunkheads being verbally demolished on those sad dates! Alan Gelfman gives a very good staight head performance as the no nonsense middle aged student. These two characters are surrounded by a whole ensemble of nosey friends, family, acquaintances and even enemies, who come and go into their lives. Special note should be made of excellent performances from actors Callie Thorne, Robert Klein, Phillipe Seymour Hoffman & Holland Taylor. Finally, mention should be made of the film's excellent soundtrack, which is made up of the classic Bossa Nova sound of Brazil. Several references are made in the movie of that country and it's wonderful culture. This music greatly contributes to the romantic and 'dreamy' tone of the film and gives it an almost continental feel. If you want to see a wonderful, romantic comedy, then I highly recommend that your next stop be ""Next Stop Wonderland""!",1106870400,7,3349,4.784110535405873

The actors are sympathetic and well developed as personalities... in fact many of the incidental actors also have interesting personalities.  The writing is excellent.  I did however find much of the middle of the movie hard to watch because of the faddish jerky ""amateur video"" style of shooting, where the camera zooms in and out and waves around ceaselessly, not holding still for long stretches.  At some point it just got to be too continuous and, fighting motion sickness, I felt like screaming ""hold the camera steady""!  Even amateur video is not this jerky; modern hand held cameras all have built in steadicam correction.  Sadly this otherwise excellent film suffers greatly from this misguided attempt at being artsy.  The jerkiness is worst in the bar scenes; it does at least relent enough towards the end to enjoy the happy ending, but the distraction prevents pleasant immersion and connecting with the film.",1106352000,,1066,5.017045454545454

996849,4,6305240671,"Next Stop Wonderland is a charming romantic comedy from independent director, Brad Anderson. This is his most accessible work to date. While I can use the word 'slight' in describing it, I must quickly add that the same adjective describes most such movies. You Have Mail, My Best Friend's Wedding, The Wedding Singer and many other big budget affairs are all entertaining, diverting and funny. Earthshaking they are not.
An independent movie like this one doesn't have the budget for the gloss and glamor of its big sisters. I personally see this as a refreshing change of pace, because as much as I enjoy the Meg Ryans, Julia Roberts and Cameron Diazes of Tinseltown, I can't transfer their screen behavior to real life.
The sparkling yet down to earth Hope Davis plays Erin, who returns to her downtown Boston home one afternoon to find her activist boyfriend loading up his car. He's leaving her. She is devastated. Being a very intelligent young woman, she supposes that men aren't worth the trouble and that being alone has its rewards. Even as she arrives at these conclusions, her expressive face shows plenty of doubt.
Across town lives Alan [Alan Gelfant], an immensely likable guy in his mid-thirties, who has gone back to school to study marine biology. He's currently a plumber like his Dad, but has come to believe he can improve upon his working-class life. He is a volunteer at the Boston Aquarium. Water, in particular the sea, plays an important part in the movie. Fish do also. You might say that a blowfish named Puff is one of the movie's stars.
One day Erin's ditzy, wealthy mother places an ad in the personal section of a Boston newspaper. The problem with this is that it's about Erin. At first outraged, Erin soon finds herself unable to resist listening to the messages that have been lefted in her voice mail. She decides to respond to a few. One of these involves Alan's brother. The fun has begun.
Wonderland plays out very much like Sleepless in Seattle, because our two lonely hearts keep coming very close to meeting - but don't - for much of the film.
The director and the stars are very assured and professional. They keep the humor rather dry. This is not intended to be a broad comedy. In fact, it explores a philosophical question. Does fate really have a hand in the events in our lives, or do things happen in a random way?
Next Stop Wonderland is the type of movie that plays especially well in DVD format. It's not a larger than life vehicle, so a big theater screen doesn't add much to it.",1017187200,19,2532,4.641425389755011
996850,4,6305240671,"Every once in a while, I decide not to post a review of a film because every other reviewer seems to have covered most of the points I'd wanted to make.  With ""Next Stop Wonderland,"" this was true right down to the very vocabulary I'd use.  It really is a ""charming"" film, its musings about ""love and destiny"" remain just that, musings, nothing too heavyhanded or mysterioso.  As an evening's entertainment, with or without the one you love or would like to love, by your side, it's hard to beat.  ""Not a masterpiece"", but very good, and ""quite original.""
But those bases had all pretty much been covered, so what was the point in just adding another positive vote?  Well, upon a second viewing I realized that there were still a few points to be made re: ""Wonderland.""  One of the reasons that it doesn't come off too cosmic in its probing of love and fate is that the dialog and the acting are so authentic.  The characters talk like real people--some you might actually pick as friends yourself and some you definitely wouldn't, but real people nonetheless.
And the acting is right on the mark.  I always thought that Holland Taylor deserved her Emmy for her work on ""The Practice"", but I did tire of that show after a while.  Her Roberta Kitelson character on that show was deftly portrayed, but she manages to do so much more with her few minutes on the screen here.  The intelligence that she injects into each line of dialogue could be used in a master acting class.  She's that good.
Of course, it may have something to do with the fact that the director was her nephew--there's nothing like keeping it all in the family--still he couldn't have chosen a better actress for the part of Erin's mom.  The only false note is her name--her character is too old to have been named after Piper Laurie, and even in Laurie's case, it's only a stage (screen?)name.
Of course, it's not just Taylor.  The whole cast is very good.  I have to agree that Hope Davis deserves a lot more attention than she has received.  This should have been her break-out movie, of course, but I guess it wasn't seen by enough people.  With the right project, though, she could at least get the kind of attention Hilary Swank and Laura Linney have achieved in recent years.
One other little apercu:  the first time I viewed this movie, I was not all that impressed with the camera work.  On a second viewing, the cinematography seems all of a piece with the naturalistic dialog and acting style.  Neither lead (Davis nor ""leading man""--scarcely the right term--Alan Gelfant are always shot at their best angle.  Sometimes they seem downright plain...sort of like, you guessed it, real people.  And that's sort of the point:  these are average people, decent people leading unremarkable lives, but ready and eager for some ordinary miracle to come their way.
The movie's very humility makes it all the more endearing.  You genuinely come to like these folks, and feel as though you know them.  They're just authentic enough, that when the two leads finally do meet at the end, after so many near misses, you can't help but say, ""Well, finally!""  With almost any other movie, you'd being saying, ""Oh, get real!""",1007337600,4,3186,4.636363636363637
996851,4,6305240671,"Clever dialogue, reality-tinged relationships, and the slow-moving hands of fate converge in this overlooked indie film. Hope Davis gives an understated and convincing performance as Erin, a nurse (med school dropout) whose long-time live-in radical activist boyfriend (a brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman) leaves her in the first moments of the movie. She seems to enjoy her single life, but her mother (Holland Taylor) doesn't think single life is healthy and places a personal ad on Erin's behalf. Meanwhile, a parallel story ensues about a man, presumably with some shady/underworld connections, leaving the plumbing industry to pursue his dream of becoming a marine biologist. Throughout the movie, this man's path crosses Erin's path, but they never meet. When Erin decides to check her personal ad mailbox, she finds that she has received an overwhelming response and decides to go on several dates (this is a fascinating part of the film), including a date with the plumber-turned-biologist's brother. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is a lighthearted look at single life and people's interactions. It explores some genuine perspectives on interacting with other people and finding the right connections to make these interactions into something more substantial.

I read some of the other user comments, and it seems as if this film has cast the same spell on some of them as well. I think it was mostly a combination of everything! First of all, Hope Davis is great, in anything. She is this beautiful woman and great actress who is so real and not sugar sweet.
I loved the soundtrack that goes with this movie... the bossa nova south american music was really original and added to it.
I also enjoyed all of the personal ad dating scenes. Even though some of the men were a little bit stereotypical, maybe some of them are really like that... Im sure there are a lot of creepy men out there that put in personal ads, especially the ones who put ""walking on the beach"" as a favorite thing to do.. I think i remember this from another movie, but some character said, ""if everyone likes to walk on the beach, how come you never see any of them out there?"" basically, people can be so fake and pretend they are someone else, so this movie captures that whole feeling.
The main character, Erin was my favorite because she was very independent and didn't feel that she was only complete if she had a man. I don't find a lot of women that are like that in real life, so I really admired that her character for that. It's a cool movie, with such a funny cameo by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the beginning (also a great actor---watch everything he has done, especially happiness!)
I totally recommend this movie to anyone who is a bit jaded by love and the idea of soulmates, but who is also dangerously romantic---bad combo!!>",995500800,4,1647,4.333333333333333

For once, the heroine is not a quivering disaffected damsel in distress with a penchant for cute one-liners. The movie works despite the fact that the guy and the girl don't meet until the very end, because it's a reflection on fate and chance...therefore on the nature of 'a perfect love.' Most of the times, romantic comedies resort to a sort of candied comedy of errors, and it's refreshing to see a film that takes an alternate, more thought-provoking route. The main characters do not meet even though there are so many chance occasions, and it seems that they are not destined to meet. Yet they meet in a train, she runs into his arms by 'sheer chance' when suffering a sense of vertigo, and this act of chance really turns out to be something that was fated upon light reflection. See the inversion? How whimsical! Everything in the story is set up to perfection, even the Thoreau quote is used to a funny effect without an air of knowing condescension.

The only thing I don't like about this video is its misleading cover.  Hope Davis perches coyly atop a subway train, slit skirt revealing plenty of thigh and low-cut top framing lotsa cleavage.  A strappy sandal dangles from one foot.  But in fact, one of the myriad beauties of this film is that Erin (deftly played by Davis) is not a frisky, flirtatious kind of gal, and never appears in any outfit more revealing than a nubby turtleck and jeans.  Erin is a sensitive soul who has been in pain ever since the death of her beloved father, and she masks her true nature with a prickly veneer.  She wants to fall in love but  fights it every step of the way.
The cover of the video implies yet another dumb, cutesie comedy with another giggly, adorable heroine (you know... the ""You've got Mail"" variety) But the movie inside is rich, delicate and highly intelligent.  Don't let the packaging fool you.",972518400,45,1087,4.482233502538071

996936,5,6305240671,"when i was living in portland maine, i was involved with a woman, who told me about this film. i am so glad i finally got to see it, because it really  moved me. I liked this film not merely because Hope Davis' character is  named Erin( though it didn't hurt! ) or that she liked poetry( that scored  another brownie point ! ) i liked this film, because it showed the story of  woman who was finiding herself socially and yet longing for the true love  that so many of us seek. some reviewers have trashed this film because it  shows men as dogs. well, sorry guys, i do know men who are like the  characters in that film. and have done some of the dirt they've done,  before i wised up. dating in real life isn't not about hearts and flowers.  more often than not, you kiss enough frogs only to end up with the best  looking frog.hope's character especially touched me, cos she was a person  who kept to herself like me, who loved being independent. hard to do in a  society, that seems to stress that you have to be with someone in order to  have a happy life. people like hope and myself are usually called  antisocial or difficult or even worse, ""psycho.""
  i loved the  love story that happened between erin and alan. ( alan gelfant ) alan was  good guy who was making something out of himself,he didn't need  erin ,but  realized she was what he was looking for . i used to hang out in boston  when i had free time, and it is a cool city. i loved the way the film show  it as if it was a supporting character. and the bossa nova flavored  soundtrack is definately sexy.
watch this with your signifigant other or  someone you want to be your signifigant other , and cook some lobsters  too...",969321600,,1695,4.221875
996937,5,6305240671,"Next Stop Wonderland is one of the most subtle and intelligent movies I  have ever seen that also entertained and at the same time opened my eyes to  a new kind of happiness.  Rather than a flashy, laugh-at-any-cost, catering  to the masses film, this one bares an irresistable vulnerability in it's  characters and storyline.
The wonderful thing about this movie is that  it dares to depict an internal struggle that everyone goes through when  faced with a transition that maybe you had no control over, in this main  character's case a laughably rude break-up.  Erin is forced to look in the  mirror when left alone, and returns to happiness as a result of internal,  private truths and independence.  At the same time, we are shown that  during this transition she is in actuality being guided by the mysterious  coincidences gently put in her path.  In the meantime we see the  development of a character who turns out to be ""meant for her"" in  a very believable, non-corny way.
All of this is accomplished with dry  humor, beautiful scenes of Boston, and an absolutely outstanding soundtrack  dedicated to the simple, contemplative, simultaneously sad and happy sound  of the Brazilian bossa nova.  The music is a literally a character in the  film:  it sets mood, and also serves as conversation piece in the  dialogue.
By the way, ""Wonderland"" is an actual subway stop in  Boston, right near the aquarium (which is another character in the film,  along with it's inhabitants).  If you by any chance saw this movie once and  expected bells, whistles, and everything spelled out for you, it's worth a  second, or fifth or tenth viewing in order to glean the personal meaning  that it offers as a gift.",968889600,,1707,4.806228373702422
996938,1,6305240671,"Consistentcy is the hobgoblin of little minds. Well this mocie sure is  consistent in being awful. I regret the two hours I lost, when I could have  been reading, writing, swimming, bicycling. Seeing this movie made me  realize how precious life and time is. Why I spent my time watching thin  acting all around, unfunny jokes, and people trying to assasinate blowfish,  I'll never know. Erin plays a quite annoying women who is never happy. Alan  is an ex-plumber, who can convey less emotion than a stone. The movie is  bizarre (and why a stop would be called ""Wonderland"" I'll never  get) and boring. It feels like something recycled. All of  the old, witty  fresh dialogue is recycled from past movies, and doesn't hang right. Next  time you feel like getting a romantic comedy fix, rent ""Romancing the  Stone"" or something-or better yet, why not read a book? I would have  rather done that.",962582400,4,895,4.733766233766234
996939,5,6305240671,"These 5 stars are coming from someone who shys away for the sappy and typically goes for the hardcore action/drama genre. I was completely surprised at how much I loved this little movie! Hope Davis was wonderful-  truly and believably shocked at every turn by the actions of the bumbling  men she comes across. I found myself laughing out loud and completely  enjoying not only the plot, the characters, and the scenery, but the  soundtrack as well. Great pick!",962064000,,462,4.810126582278481
996940,5,6305240671,"Do we really need another soppy romantic comedy about thirtysomethings in the big city? Watching NEXT STOP WONDERLAND, the answer is ""Yes."" As I prepared to be depressed beyond reason by two wonderful people ending  up alone (and pleasantly disappointed), I ended up laughing unexpectedly at  the humor cropping up in odd places. Alan Gelfant is charming and  sympathetic in his hilarious aquarium-heist subplot. Philip Seymour Hoffman  (as in every movie he's done) takes a character that could have been a  bland stereotype and puts his own indelible stamp on it. H. Jon Benjamin  (the slacker, layabout son Ben from the ""Dr. Katz"" show) is  hilarious as one of Erin's loutish blind dates. Holland Taylor brings the  frigid high-class sexiness of Judge Roberta Kittleson from ""The  Practice"" and ""Ally McBeal"" to her role as Erin's mother.  Roger Rees is hilarious and sleazy as the biology teacher. It's also  refreshing that the movie takes place in Boston and not in New York  (memories of YOU'VE GOT MAIL). The main attraction, of course, is Davis,  who incarnates Erin better than most actresses could have dreamed of doing.  Even though it's not in theatres anymore, this is an outstanding date movie  (practically as good as FLIRTING).",959731200,29,1244,5.059113300492611
996941,5,6305240671,"What a wonderful story and a wonderful cast of characters!  Hope Davis plays Erin, a nurse living in Boston (near the MTA Wonderland stop) who has been dumped for political reasons by her boyfriend (Philip Seymour  Hoffman).  Erin's mother urges her to find someone new, and to help things  along plants a ""singles advertisement"" on her behalf in the local  newspaper.  The resulting original storyline follows the twists and turns  that result from this maternal interference.
There are a few sight gags,  but most of the humor is derived from the wonderful, witty dialogue. You  will remember some of the lines for a long time, and may be humming the  music from the sound track for a while.",957744000,,693,4.796610169491525

I found Hope Davis's character to be a little lackluster and tiresome to watch after while.  The male lead, whose name I've forgotten, is actually quite good and his presence kept me interested.  There is the usual group of cliched supporting characters who are supposed to be funny and endearing but are not.  I did like the fish motif.  Some of the best shots were of a very cute blowfish.

Phillip Seymour Hoffiman is only a minor character in a very few scenes.",1452902400,,630,4.571428571428571
7885959,5,6305240671,"This film is a favorite of mine.  The writing, directing, acting are excellent and rare. It's a quiet film so deliciously nuanced and honed that while it both invites and demands (so as not to miss all the goodies) your complete focus, it moves with an ease and grace that fine-tuning and smart editing engender. The two protagonists pass each other unaware and in a variety of ways throughout the film, without any contrivance in the action. While this appears to occur effortlessly, it has an added teasing and playful quality like those games in childhood in which we must find an object mostly hidden in a picture. The phrase quoted and misquoted by all the suitors and attributed to diverse authors becomes like the glass slipper which fits only one. Much action occurs in an aquarium, offering a hazy and mysterious setting for a great subplot, not to be spoiled here ; I just must mention that the theme of something treasured going missing may be a clever allusion to a major Boston event. The Brazilian musical underpinning becomes understood in a number of  references, but just on its own provides that moody, longing, sexy element congruent with the storyline.  Superior job by leads Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.  Great writing by Brad Anderson and Lyn Vaus. Now it makes perfect sense that Brad Anderson was writer, director, and film editor.",1449446400,,1355,4.827586206896552
