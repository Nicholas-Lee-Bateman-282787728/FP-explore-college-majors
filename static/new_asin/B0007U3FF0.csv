8051752,2,B0007U3FF0,"In order to identify something as ""ultimate"", it should be a foregone conclusion that a comparison against likes would be in order. This is not the case here; we get to see only one weapon that was disassembled in a different video put together with one set of parts that were already chosen. The video is broken up into sections, one on assembly, one on shooting the weapon, and one on gunsmithing. The first section, assembly, is just that (don't assume you'll get anything on disassembly - you won't); it references other video products (for sale, of course) and gives no information on the range of choices, only some limited information on the choices the made for this one build and where to get the parts (Brownells for almost everything, apparently). The second section is of mild interest - we see a woman of small-to-average stature fire the weapon a few times. We are presented with a recommendation to use light bird-shot loads for home defense and shown the effect of both bird-shot and slugs on drywall (actual load not identified - certainly not any kind of buck-shot). The third section on gunsmithing is probably the most useful with a little information on shortening a barrel, honing a barrel, and one or two other items. The host does seem to understand what he is doing, but there is little actual material covered - the ""over 90 minutes"" (accurate if you count the commercials, etc.) is not a montage - the actual work is fully performed... sadly that is just using a screwdriver for the most part (also a hammer, briefly). Production value is average overall, lighting was decent and there was attention paid to keeping the action basically viewable. The wind on the microphone was obvious (only one day to get the outdoor part filmed?) and the primary cameraman did show up on the second camera as well as the subjects.

Pros
- The host is knowledgeable and speaks clearly
- All of the assembly is shown (one weapon assembled one time)
- The source for parts is identified
- Chapters 1 and 2 can be used effectively to treat insomnia (3 can if you are not a gunsmith)

Cons
- The entire dis-assembly process is skipped (""go buy another of our DVDs"")
- The range of available enhancements is not listed or identified
- There is little information on why the particular parts were chosen as opposed to others (there is a good, albeit lengthy description on the magazine follower choice)
- Everything here is available on the web - often presented in a more usable format
- The description (and other review) seemed to indicate a great wealth of information that was not there - the entire detail on ""combat light options"" = put a flashlight on the weapon

This might be of very mild interest to would-be gunsmiths looking at a Remington 870 shotgun as a first project, but if you are looking for a good, in-depth review of the options available or how to fit the not-quite-perfectly-fitting parts together, look elsewhere.",1347667200,2,2944,4.712621359223301
8051753,5,B0007U3FF0,"This is a great little video for those of you who are interested in home defense.  If you are one of these folks, you've probably come to all or at least some of these conclusions:

- a pistol or rifle are dangerous weapons for home defense - not to just the criminal but to the homeowner who can't hit the target with a tiny bullet in the dark ... once you miss a perp, you might as well start praying.
- there is real danger with a rifle or pistol to the kids sleeping in the next room who could be injured or killed when a stray bullet easily penetrates a wall and the same goes for the neighbors next door.  A .357 Mag can easily penetrate your walls and your neighbors, leading to tragic consequences if an innocent human being gets in the way.  A properly constructed self defense shotgun using the proper loads doesn't wreak this sort of havoc, but it surely will stop an intruder dead in his tracks and it's awfully hard to miss with this thing.  (forget the guru's who tell you to use 00 buckshot ... you might just as well be firing multiple .38's)
- how do you know it's an intruder and not just your daughter coming home late from a date or your son who lives out of town just stopping in during a business trip that took him by his boyhood home?  This video shows you how you can avoid this tragedy.
- the best defense is to have a working alarm system that will likely scare off any intruder as soon as it is set off.  If you get a bad guy who keeps coming after hearing a blaring siren, you've got a real hard case and you will thank your God that you had the foresight to have a home defense weapon.  The whole idea is to scare them off.  If that doesn't work, plan B is to make the perp dead while keeping you and your family safe.  If this last statement makes your heart flutter, think of this; what right does anybody have in your house without your invitation, especially in the middle of the night?  Why are they there?  For those of you who think this never happens, read the statistics.

This video answers these issues and then shows you how to easily build a tactical Remington 870 shotgun for home defense use.  The author starts out with an inexpensive used gun and then converts it from a plain shotgun to a true defensive weapon.  It's not hard to find a used 870 because this is very likely the most prolific shotgun ever produced (I'm guessing millions).  It is inexpensive, reliable and easy to use.  If you're not handy, you can buy a new tactical version of this gun for under $400 and then add the light mods and extra on-board ammo storage that the authors suggest.  If you don't want to do any of the work, watching this video will help you with self defense techniques while showing you what a top notch defensive shotgun looks like so that when you talk to your gunsmith you can tell him exactly what you want.  By the way, the author and presenter is a master gunsmith and knows his craft cold.  You just couldn't get better advice on this subject.  The subject matter is covered in a clear concise and logical fashion and the video quality is excellent.

I highly recommend this video to anyone who has an interest in self protection and I also think that this DVD should be on the shelf at every gun club in America.

Guns certainly aren't for everyone but remember, the Second Amendment is for all Americans ... you ARE the militia, especially when police help is precious minutes away (these days, it's often much longer).  If you do chose to exercise your Constitutional rights, do your homework, get educated, get trained, buy the best equipment you can afford and then take control of your own safety.  Hopefully, you'll never have to use all this for anything but peace of mind.",1280620800,7,3727,4.351156069364162
