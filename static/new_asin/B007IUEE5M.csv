8517975,2,B007IUEE5M,pollution bad... we are actually cooling and antartica's ice grew since 2008. We need to take care of mother earth.,1403049600,,115,4.8
8517976,5,B007IUEE5M,"To consider this film through an aesthetic lens is to miss the core of this film, which happens to be creeping in on the biggest imminent threat we are facing in our clime reality. Lets forget for one moment that the Pine Island Glacier (a chunk of glacier the size of Chicago) has departed into our not so fair seas; in fact, lets not even consider where it broke off for a second. Lets talk about why the crew was even able to set foot on the ground to begin with.

Oops, I guess I accidentally talked about it.

The sun is heating the exposed ground, which is causing the rest of the inland glacier to melt from the bottom, causing the rest of the ice to slide into our oceans.

Now imagine a bathtub filled almost to the top. How many ice cubes will it take? -- How many Chicagos? New Yorks? Torontos? -- before Florida has to start wearing wading boots ... Or moving north?

The film interviews the actual people on the ground. If you don't care for Mark taking a dip in (the surprisingly warm) in the glacial water, good for you! Pay attention to real people sharing their life's work and add it to your pile of knowledge.

Who knows, maybe one day you might contribute to a better, more sustainable world; maybe you already are.

If so, keep doing your part brothers and sisters.",1380153600,2,1286,4.3375
8517977,1,B007IUEE5M,This is awful.  It does a disservice to genuine Climate Change science.  What does people mucking around in a bottom dredge sample have to do with Climate Change?  And why do we have to keep seeing the face and hearing the voice of the producer.  If you are truly concerned about Climate Change ... and you should be ... seek elsewhere.,1377648000,,336,4.459016393442623
