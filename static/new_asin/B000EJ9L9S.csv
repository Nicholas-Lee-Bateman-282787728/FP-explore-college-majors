8110604,1,B000EJ9L9S,"This video is very poor.  The steps are explained while there is a blank screen.  Then the dancers execute the dance movement at actual speed.  The video never slows down to show the steps.  Basically, if you go to the club and record the dance moves, then go home and try to mimic them--is what you get.  The only difference is that it explains the steps before showing them.  I expected someone to show me the steps in slow motion or one at a time so that I could follow them.  Instead I got someone dancing and I'm suppose to learn like that.",1290729600,2,545,4.233009708737864
8110605,1,B000EJ9L9S,"This amateur DVD was badly made. It's overpriced considering the quality and a waste of money. If anyone gives it a good rating, they're probably in the video.",1262131200,2,159,4.714285714285714
8110606,2,B000EJ9L9S,"this video does not really provide detailed steps to follow but the steps are very simple to follow especially for the bachata dance. it has several choices from  beginner to intermediate to advance which you can select. this instructional dvd is much better than the ""salsa dance dvd"" they also produced which has very complicated steps for the advance level and which no detailed steps are explained. i have no comments about the reggaeton dance section because i am too old to dance that particular dance and i never watched it anyway.",1222732800,,538,4.8478260869565215
8110607,1,B000EJ9L9S,"Do not waste your money on this! Whoever reviewed before obviously did not watch it or is getting paid for positive review. It offers nothing. Amateur production, which is also renamed and released under many other names. There is basically nothing that you will get from this except poorer.",1175731200,6,291,4.959183673469388
