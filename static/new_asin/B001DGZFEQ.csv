3529515,3,B001DGZFEQ,"having never done pilates before i thought i would be pretty sore, but i found the moves too simple , so maybe try one of her other dvd's. not very challenging.",1223683200,,160,4.193548387096774
3529516,4,B001DGZFEQ,"The Pilates for Pink workout has sections for upper body, lower body, and abs. There are separate workout options available on the DVD menu, or you can do them all together for a 50 minute workout. There is a pink exercise band included with the workout.

Overall, I'm glad I bought it. The exercises combine traditional pilates matwork (hundreds, single leg stretch etc) with exercises that take advantage of the band and are meant to simulate reformer or other machine exercises. I didn't feel over tired afterward, but i did feel like I got good toning in. And even though it's 50 minutes or so and not terribly fast-paced, I didn't feel bored. The arm exercises were fun, but I won't know how effective they are until I've done the workout more. Overall, it's a good recommendation if you are just starting out, or if you have another pilates DVD or two and want some variety, but if you have other stuff from Winsor, I don't know how repetitive this one would be. It reminded me of the 10 minute solution slim and sculpt pilates, which also uses the band. So if you like one, you'll like the other.

They give $1 to Breast Cancer for each purchase, so this would make a thoughtful purchase or gift anyway. If some of the money didn't go to cancer, I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay full price for it.",1222819200,29,1306,4.460251046025105
3529517,5,B001DGZFEQ,I can't believe how sore I am - I am using muscles I didn't even know I had!  This is a GREAT workout for your core. Mari is really an amazing instructor!,1222732800,3,154,3.8125
3529518,5,B001DGZFEQ,"Really enjoy this workout.  So far, getting good results too.
I also like the band and the way it allows you to make the workout easier or harder.",1395792000,,146,4.214285714285714
3529519,4,B001DGZFEQ,"I really wanted to like this, but it's just uncomfortable for me to use the band for some of the workouts. I'm sure it's a good method, but just not for me.",1391299200,,156,3.90625
3529520,5,B001DGZFEQ,"Never tried pilates till now.
I love using the band ,  and the workout is great !
Soft easy movements. Keeps me in great shape.",1389398400,,127,4.08
3529521,4,B001DGZFEQ,"When I ordered this it specifically said that it would be in the original package. I just received it and the safety label on the top of the dvd case was there, but you could still open up the bottom - I only know this due to the fact that I did not notice the safety label on the top and tried to open it. Inside was a purple resistance band...this workout is actually called ""Pink Workout"" for breast cancer. Now I'm thinking that it is a different strength band.

This is the second time that this has happened, although, with the last dvd it was supposed to be a blue band and there wasn't one at all. Though I could purchase the band separately for $20 here....think about that.

The workout itself is fine. Mari Winsor workouts are my favorite and will always recommend them to anyone. But probably not recommend them purchasing them here.",1378684800,,845,4.410256410256411
3529522,4,B001DGZFEQ,"This is very similar to previous band pilates videos she has done before. Not too challenging, good for beginners and she is encouraging.",1365552000,,137,5.0
3529523,4,B001DGZFEQ,This is very good Pilates workout. There are clear examples of every fitness level. Great!  I know this one will be one of my favorites.,1361232000,,136,4.44
3529524,5,B001DGZFEQ,"I've only done this workout a couple of times because each time I do, my whole body is excruciatingly sore, and it stays that way for two or three days afterward.  Ow, it hurts so bad.  I know there are people who enjoy that soreness, but not me.  On the other hand, I'm getting ready to grit my teeth and go after it, and keep doing it until I can do it without being so sore. The thing I love about it allows me to work lots of muscles in my legs without doing squats or lunges, which always hurt my knees.  So.  I think this is the right workout for me.  I just need to push through the soreness.",1359417600,,599,3.95
3529525,5,B001DGZFEQ,I bought this DVD because I wanted a new pilates band and for the price of the band and DVD together seemed like a good deal.  The DVD is fine for beginners.,1358467200,,157,3.90625
3529526,4,B001DGZFEQ,"It's good to workout any places I can, but I have more learn and practice!
For this band which I received, it seem shorter than in DVD I'm not sure.  Anyway I still like it!",1354492800,,173,3.942857142857143
3529527,3,B001DGZFEQ,"I was dissappointed with the quality of the band....the length was fine, but the band was a bit too flimsy.  The old blue pilates band was much better..",1351036800,,152,4.428571428571429
3529528,5,B001DGZFEQ,"Great beginner pilates workout with exercise band ( included in package)  a workout for all ages but especially good
  for non athletic type who needs to get moving, stretching, and exercising ....",1348185600,,197,5.09375
3529529,5,B001DGZFEQ,"I love Mari Windsor and this video follows suit with the rest, easy to use and a good workout. Choice of zones to workout, i.e upper body, lower body, or abs, or all three. Love it!",1330300800,,181,4.055555555555555
3529530,5,B001DGZFEQ,"My first experience with Pilates and I am very pleased.  It really tones and I got taller! I believe the added height is do to the stretching while working the muscles, my back simply was able to decompress. When I saw my midwife, pregnant with my 6th, she couldn't believe I had 5 others as my stomach muscles were so toned.",1316822400,,325,4.327868852459017
3529531,4,B001DGZFEQ,Its okay. Need mat for your back and floor excercises. I prefer free weights to a rubber band stretchy! Actually the Kettle weights workouts are way better!,1313971200,,156,4.814814814814815
3529532,5,B001DGZFEQ,I would highly recommend anyone looking for a great pilates dvd to buy this one....I am truley hooked on this pilate stuff and loved getting good deals on them too!!,1306022400,,165,4.533333333333333
3529533,5,B001DGZFEQ,I have many of Mari's Pilates workouts.  I have experience working with the exercise bands but just didn't enjoy these.  I thought the band was too thin and it kept slipping off my feet.  I exchanged it for one of my bands that is thicker and longer and was more pleased.,1297123200,,271,4.2745098039215685
3529534,3,B001DGZFEQ,"I have been using winsor for years, and I have to tell you, that I was not very happy with this DVD. The first time I use the program the stretch belt snapped in half, now if I was over weight I would say okay, I can see how it's now  strong enough, but I am not. I only need to lose 20bls and tone as I have done before with her very first program.",1276905600,,349,3.6533333333333333
3529535,4,B001DGZFEQ,"This is a great product, especially for those new to pilates. My cousin purchased this dvd and told me about it. I tried out hers first, and loved the workout. You can especially feel the burn around the legs and butt area. Its great! I have only been doing this work out for a week and my butt is already sculpted. I haven't noticed any reslults in my ab area, that is an area I have to work harder on. But you can definately feel the burn! My only disapointment was the free band that it came with. In my cousin's dvd it came with the actual band that they use in the dvd to work out with, in my dvd which is the same it came with a cheap latex band. It was a long stretched out latex balloon. It was only 5 ft long which is way too short. When you use the band there should be some slack in it so you can choose the resistence that you are comfortable with. I am only 5 foot 1... So I was definately straining myself using the band it came with. Be aware of what band you get, you may get the right band or you could get the cheapy! It may be worth buying a better quality band along with the dvd. Overall I am very happy with the pace and work outs used in the dvd, I now have to buy a new band!!!",1273708800,3,1201,3.866396761133603
3529536,2,B001DGZFEQ,"I love Mari Winsor and her videos, but this one didn't do much for me. It didn't seem that intense and I wasn't feeling the burn at all. Maybe for a beginner this would be better. I think I will stick to her other workouts. Each exercise is pretty short, so by the time you get the hang of it, it's over. Good luck!",1265673600,2,315,3.9375
3529537,5,B001DGZFEQ,"This video is very enjoyable,easy to follow. Mari is an excellent instructor. I like the resistance belt,for me,is easy to use it. Only the abs part is not complete. But I love this dvd anyway!",1260576000,,193,4.542857142857143
3529538,5,B001DGZFEQ,Excellent dvd for pilates.  She does a really good job with the resistance band and showing how to do the moves.,1260489600,,112,4.333333333333333
3529539,5,B001DGZFEQ,"I will start with one negative thing, the band is hard to keep in place, but that is not the instructors fault.  Mari Windsor is a most excellent instructor, and choreographer.  This workout was well organized, well paced, and well rounded.  I love Pilates and do alot of it.  Mari is my favorite instructor, and this is my favorite DVD.",1256601600,,337,4.566666666666666
3529540,2,B001DGZFEQ,"the band was annoying and like everyone else said,it kept slipping off! The only good thing about this is some of my money went to fight breast cancer,but other than that I like mari's other dvd's wayy better.",1254960000,,209,4.526315789473684
3529541,4,B001DGZFEQ,"I added this DVD to my home collection of Pilates videos a couple of months ago. I like the addition of the resistance belt and I find that if you position the belt as recommended in the video it never slips off. The DVD is split into 3 segments and can be played as a long 50 minute workout, which is what I love about it. I have several DVDs that contain workouts between 20-30 minutes, but sometimes I really want a longer pilates experience.

On a critical note, the ab workout is much weaker than other DVDs I have. I wish there was an option to string the other two workouts together to play automatically, but as far as I can tell there is not. I keep my remote close by to skip over that section if I want a more intense ab workout and then I play a different video to focus on that area.",1247443200,5,796,4.070063694267516
3529542,4,B001DGZFEQ,"This is a great work out. It works the whole body, only the stomach part is not so effective.
I would recommend this programm if you combine it with another one of Mari Winsor workout.",1245024000,,184,4.285714285714286
3529543,5,B001DGZFEQ,This is my 1st pilates DVD and I think it's a great start out.  The 50 mins goes by very fast.  I have 3 daughters and my 2 youngest get down on the floor with me to do the routines.  This is a fun workout to do when I don't feel like heading downstairs to use my Total Gym.  I will definitely buy more of Mari's DVD's once I get stronger.,1242172800,,339,3.732394366197183
3529544,3,B001DGZFEQ,It is ok but the band is very awkward to work with and causes quite a strain on your hands.  Some of the exercises feel like your not getting much of a workout.,1241913600,,160,3.8484848484848486
3529545,2,B001DGZFEQ,"I was hoping for a new Pilates workout program; this was just a re-hash of the Windsor Pilates tapes I already have with the addition of a stretch band.  I found the stretch band cumbersome to use in the timeframe the DVD alloted for each routine.  By the time I had everything in place, the routine was almost over.  Overall I was not impressed, and thankful I didn't pay full price. I will continue to use my original tapes and this one will probably gather dust on the shelf.",1240876800,3,478,4.348314606741573
3529546,5,B001DGZFEQ,"Pilates for Pink is a great way to stretch before you do your more vigorous exercises. I really appreciate the simplicity of this video because Mari removed some of the more advanced exercises and it's a fast 50 minutes and very straight forward!:) Also, very enjoyable.

It's been a few years since I've done Pilates and I thought that this tape would be a great way to get back into Pilates and build up from there. I normally do heavy cardio with light weights and needed something that would give me a REALLY good stretch. It just reminded me of how flexible and in shape I used to be when I was doing Pilates regularly. I just worked up a light sweat after doing this video and I feel great!:)Very good lower body workout, especially the CLAM. The tighter you grip the band, the more burn you will feel in the upper body workout.
When you are doing the Ab work is when the band seems to slip off the most. The trick is to put the band at the ball of your feet and grip the rest of the band a little tighter than you normally would. I don't think there is any other option. :)

This is a great buy because of the stretching and the ability to get in some light toning. In my opinion, WELL worth the money and the time. I'm looking forward to purchasing more of Mari's videos. This was my fisrt purchase thru Amazon and I am very pleased. The price for the video and shipping was less than the actual $14.99 that Pilates for Pink is going for.",1240704000,21,1446,4.2355072463768115
3529547,4,B001DGZFEQ,I've only done this tape once and I didn't get to use the band because I worked out with my daughter and let her use the band-(she did the tape everyday when she was home on spring break) it seems pretty effective even without the band. It's kind of long so it's not a tape that I can fit in more than once a week with my schedule. The moves have a nice flow to them. I would recommend to others.,1239580800,,396,3.9012345679012346
3529548,5,B001DGZFEQ,Great price - fast delivery. Recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to get in shape. Also definitely would buy from this seller again.,1238544000,,132,4.782608695652174
3529549,5,B001DGZFEQ,"I bought this DVD when I saw it advertised in SHAPE.  I bought it because the sales support breast cancer research.  I had no expectations of the actual workout and it was actually a nice surprise.  Since a lot of women are probably buying it in support of the cause I think they made a good choice in gearing the workout to beginners.  The bands are a nice addition.  For what it is, SHAPE and Mari Windsor did a nice job.",1235952000,,423,4.172839506172839
3529550,5,B001DGZFEQ,"I have Mari's initial pilates DVD,and have not used a band with pilates before and felt that it was a good challenge you definitely feel your muscles working.  If you are new to pilates I definitely recommend this, however if you are advanced you probably will not get too much of a challenge from this DVD.",1232236800,7,307,4.482142857142857
3529551,4,B001DGZFEQ,"I enjoy Mari Windor's style and cuing of the moves.  I own her Basic 3 DVD set and find myself working Pilates into my workouts regularly.  There is nothing that will make a stomach flatter than some of the Pilates moves.  If you own a pilates dvd already you are probably familiar with many of these moves already.  The fun challenge is in getting in a little extra resistance for extra toning by using the pink resistance band that is included in the dvd.

It took me a little while to get the placement of the band for some of the moves so it wouldn't slip off, but I enjoyed having a light toning workout that gave me a little extra resistance.

The moves are basic and Mari's style is not too chatty, she gives you the move, you do some concentrated reps and you are on to the next move.  If you are working into the muscle correctly you don't need a million reps to get excellent results.

This is NOT a sweaty workout-if you are looking for heart pumping action, this is not your kind of workout, but for me, as a daily exerciser this would be a workout that I would go to on one of my light workout days or as extra toning after I've been walking.

Best of all, besides that nice flat tummy you'll get from frequent use?  $1.00 from each sale goes to Breast Cancer Research.",1231977600,7,1282,4.238683127572016
3529552,2,B001DGZFEQ,"I have been nearly completely bedridden for the last 8 years, and have been ill for 12. I am 60 years old and just starting to become well again, and my first thought for fitness was Pilates and abs. I also like supporting the breast cancer research, so I purchased this, thinking that anything would be a challenge for me.
This wasn't. And if it doesn't challenge me, it won't challenge you. Get something else, breast cancer can be supported in useful ways, too",1231804800,2,463,4.523809523809524
3529553,5,B001DGZFEQ,This workout is wonderful for people with lower back problems!  I have done several of the Winsor pilates workouts and this one done correctly is by far the best workout I have ever done.  The more I do it the better it gets.  The band is effective for toning the arms especially.  The band also helps take the stress off of the lower back when doing the leg and abs workout.  I have given this dvd to friends because I love it so much.,1230854400,2,436,4.142857142857143
3529554,4,B001DGZFEQ,"I have enjoyed Mari's workouts for years now, and this one did not disappoint. Anyone familiar with her other videos will find it very easy to follow along; for anyone just starting out, she does a thorough explanation and goes slow so you can keep up easily. There aren't a lot of reps, but she does emphasize correct form, resistance, breathing, etc. to make sure you get the most of what you're doing. There's also a modified ""model"" to follow if you need to, and Mari walks through the modifications as well. After completing the whole 50 minutes I felt like I got a good workout, but not ""noodly"" or over tired. My ONLY suggestion would be to do a little more stretching at the end, especially if you're not used to pilates or regular muscle training. I added about 5 minutes of extra stretches to the end and felt a lot more loosened up than just doing her ""cool down"" section. Overall I would definitely recommend this video to anyone looking to add pilates to their workout!",1230854400,2,982,4.522471910112359
3529555,1,B001DGZFEQ,"I think the only reason I purchased this product was to support the fight against breast cancer because I couldn't have intended to sweat.  The little pink band that comes with it is worthless and kept slipping off my feet to the point of annoyance and the workout lasts maybe ten minutes.  I thought this DVD would at least be good for making myself more flexible.  Needless to say after the pilates craze, this ""workout"" fell short.",1227916800,,434,4.6103896103896105

The routine is broken into segments to give you the option of doing the entire routine or selecting what parts of your body you want to concentrate on.  The band helps strengthen too.
