8712445,5,B00W7AGZS2,"This is an awesome series. At first I wondered if the better half of Harold and Kumar could pull of an educational program such as this but the layout of this show is a perfect fit. In each episode he gives you the big picture of many different categories including crime, treasure, disease, and many more! bsome of the statistics in this show will absolutely blow your mind. This show keeps you interested at all times and gives you information I truly believe every person should know. Great buy! Fun Show! Highly highly recomended!",1456790400,,534,4.691489361702128
