2201197,1,B00076PCPU,"I fell asleep. I can't write much of a review because I fell asleep but I saw enough that just the thought of rewinding to see the whole thing makes me want to fall asleep again. Elizabeth Shue is prominently on the front but I saw enough (and I read comments on IMDB) that makes me wonder why since she is a very minor role (according to IMDB comments, blink and you miss her). Personally, I added the movie to my watch list because of her -- I never would have added it if the cover was Sarah Jessica Parker only.",1456358400,,515,4.108910891089109

2201203,4,B00076PCPU,"I think it was a good movie. There wasn't anything supernatural about it. It was a dream that she had. In the beginning they show her in the hospital.

He's not; just not the best actor. Anyway, the movie as a whole is pretty cute and I enjoyed it. It was not Oscar worthy but I'm glad I saw it.",1439164800,,312,3.9682539682539684

Not in my opinion the first Sarah Jessica Parker movie I'd recommend and in all serious watching it once was good enough for me. I found it bittersweet and at times enjoyable. However, what really bothered me about the movie was its ending. I won't ruin it but it was confusing and didn't make sense. Overall, not a bad movie just not a well told story.

2201222,1,B00076PCPU,"Bad, bad, bad 80's movie ... and how did Elizabeth Shue's 5 seconds of screen time warrant her photo in the marketing?!?",1432857600,,120,4.5
2201223,4,B00076PCPU,This was a fairly old movie. I've had trouble finding it. My husband told me to check out amazon. And there it was! I'm happy to have it. It came pretty fast and great quality as well.,1431561600,,184,4.0
2201224,2,B00076PCPU,Unbelievable,1430956800,,12,12.0
2201225,3,B00076PCPU,"The camera quality wasn't good, the acting sub par, but the story was sweet.  Before I go on, (for those of you who have Amazon Prime), for some reason Elizabeth Shue is shown on the cover. I don't know why they did this, but she is NOT in the movie, unless, of course, I blinked and they showed her face for a brief second. I was curious about her role in the film and actually looked for her, but I never saw her. And she wasn't listed in the credits. Very odd!

The film was about a young girl, Lori Anderson, (Sara Jessica Parker), who is seen in the hospital, in a coma. The doctor is confused because she had hit he'd head after being thrown by a horse, but she only has a mild concussion. For some reason, she has apparently given up on life, and they can't revive her.

Lori was devastated about her father's death and her mother's impending marriage to family friend, and local police officer. One stressful day, she heads out on horseback and happens to witness a two-seater plane crash. After making sure that both pilot and passenger are okay, she attempts to ride for help--but her horse throws her and she hits her head on a tree.

After that, the story takes a turn. She awakens after hitting her head, walks back to the crash, and finds out that one of the young men, the pilot (Terry) has died. But afterward, she meets up with his ghost. At first, she is frightened. But soon she and Terry develop a friendship, and Lori believes that Terry was sent by her father to help break up her mother's relationship with the police officer. Turns out that he was sent for a very different reason.

The camera quality and acting might not be the best, and the soundtrack is terrible, but the movie was made in 1983, so that should tell you something. Still, all that aside, it's a very sweet movie, with a twist ending, that doesn't disappoint... as long as you leave your academy award expectations at the door.",1430265600,,1920,4.397183098591549

2201228,4,B00076PCPU,"Movie was a little cheesy, wasn't movie theater quality but it was a nice little movie. Kind of reminded me of ""Just Like Heaven"". It was a good clean movie-no foul language and it was neat to see actors when they were younger. Don't know why Elizabeth Shue is on the cover-didn't see her at all in movie. Good movie to watch for free on Prime.",1428624000,,344,4.2272727272727275
2201229,2,B00076PCPU,This reminds me of an old movie. It is an old movie. That means I'm getting older too. You will see a very young Sarah Jessica Parker and Elisabeth Shu in Somewhere Tomorrow. It's not the most exciting movie to watch but if you are a fan of the two actresses  mentioned you might enjoy seeing them in their younger years.,1428537600,,321,4.262295081967213
2201230,1,B00076PCPU,I don't want to give it any stars. it must be what Sarah Jessica Parker had to do to get a start in acting.  She should have just slept with someone.  That would not have been so disgusting.,1428537600,,190,3.973684210526316

2201236,1,B00076PCPU,Flat performances. Caught between a teens POV. and a neutral observer takes away the magic of the ending.,1426377600,,105,4.888888888888889
2201237,4,B00076PCPU,"This movie is definitely not a Oscar winner, however, it holds your attention throughout the movie. The plot starts with the activities leading up to an accident, then there is a twist. You would think that this is the result of the main accident, but the twists makes you wonder if she could really see the person. The ending is a very pleasant surprise but it is a great movie to watch for young teenage adults.",1425945600,,413,4.447368421052632
2201238,1,B00076PCPU,"Poorly written story that tried to put in all things in one bucket - a coming of age, releasing grief, fantasy prince charming and horse story. Its the type of film that is so poorly written only a child could really enjoy it. Too morbid to be disneyesque but just enough to delude a very, very, very sheltered girl. It was interesting to see the actors attempt to work around the script. The characters were not nuanced in any way. The young girl comes off as selfish and arrogant and her mother does not fare much better. The dialog between mother and daughter reflects the writers inexperience with women in general and downplays the real pain that could have made this a much more honest and sweet coming of age.",1425168000,,716,4.515384615384615

Through him, she learns how to deal with her father's death and her mother's pending remarriage. I love teen movies and this one is actually very well acted, the characters believable and the plot entertaining.

2201252,5,B00076PCPU,Enjoyed this movie. I had seen it many years ago and it had stayed with me. Love a movie that is enjoyable to watch and also leaves you with a good feeling. So glad that I was able to finally find this movie on DVD.,1410998400,,215,3.8
2201253,5,B00076PCPU,"You've gotta see this movie! It is sweet and heartwarming. Lori meets the Ghost of Terry, and neither of them realizes he's dead. He sticks alround long enouth to help her through her problems, with a great twist at the end. It's not vastly different from other falling-in-love-with-a-ghost movies, but it's so sweet and engaging, who cares? It's a great hour and a half of entertainment.",1408752000,,388,4.893939393939394

This little film has more value than the entire series of the shallow, self indulgent Sex In The City..",1209168000,,311,4.571428571428571
2201273,4,B00076PCPU,"This is a teen romantic comedy/drama with some serious themes about death treated in a way that's very optimistic, to say the least.  Teen Sarah Jessica Parker has to deal with her father's death, her mother's moving on to a new romance, and her own romance with ... a ghost.  This is apparently pitched at a high school age audience but is well enough done for older folks to enjoy, if you go in for this kind of thing.  I thought it had some originality, some good humor, no gaping holes that you can't fill in with a little effort, if you're inclined to.  Sarah Jessica Parker sings in it, which is a bit odd given how awkwardly it comes off, but that brief moment may be of interest to fans.

The film is rated PG, has a ""family film"" feel, with just a little of what might be considered very mild adult situations.  The film was obviously low-budget, but the production values and acting are good enough for the story.

As others have said, be careful which release you get.  I have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Digiview-release/dp/B0007NHFEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Digiview release</a>, which is very cheap used but only fair in video and sound quality.  Still perfectly watchable, at least for me.  You can sometimes find the Digiview DVD for a buck at discount stores.

2201274,5,B00076PCPU,"This DVD release by Guilty Pleasures-Media Blasters is the full length version (91 minutes) I notice some scenes are missing on various releases listed below.

The DVD release for SOMEWHERE TOMORROW is very interesting because several DVD companies notably Digiview/Legacy (US/Canada)-Walmart (US)/ MRA (Australia Region 4)/Boulevard Entertainment-Woman's Own (UK Region 2) and finally AN OFFICIAL RELEASE BY THE COMPANY THAT CO-PRODUCED THIS FILM MEDIA-BLASTERS. I have every copy and studied the quality of the DVD transfer. Digiview, Walmart, Legacy and MRA are very grainy and choppy in places (Poor transfers). The Boulevard Entertainment (UK) and Media-Blasters (US) are perfect DVD picture (clarity/sharpness/no bleeding colours) quality and are clearly direct film transfers. Interestingly Media-Blasters (US) originally released 'Somewhere Tomorrow' on Video in the 1980s.

This is an entertaining twist of a story, with delights of joy and sadness, blended with humour about dealing with death of a loved one, in this case Lori's father. Somewhere Tomorrow was made in 1983. Despite the low budget it's got a great storyline, though you may need to watch it twice to understand the twist towards the end. A charming and moving film.

Thankyou Media-blasters for finally releasing the rare gem of a film on DVD.",1199664000,,1320,5.557213930348259
2201275,5,B00076PCPU,"I have now been able to compare TWO of the DVD versions available. One by ""LEGACY"" and one by ""DIGIVIEW"". The DIGIVIEW release sometimes comes in a THIN case. The picture quality on both releases is a bit ""soft"" but I believe that the DIGIVIEW version is slightly crisper (not by much). I would recommend that you purchase the one with the lowest price, and the DIGIVIEW version regularly shows up at 99 cent stores! The LEGACY version is also available in a box set called ""Tales of the Heart"" with three other films (challenge the wind, choices, silence of the heart). I would recommend that you avoid that box set at all costs because the transfers for the other films are quite horrible! The transfer of Somewhere Tomorrow on the box set is the same as the stand-alone LEGACY version.

I won't go into a review of the film itself because it has already been covered! I'll just say that if you like fairy-tales and tend to enjoy other ""early 80's"" entertainment... you'll love this one!

2201276,4,B00076PCPU,"This is a review of the Digiview edition of this movie, which is still available here and there, for very little cash.  The picture quality of this version is OK, about what you'd expect for the price, i.e. a little soft, somewhat grainy, colors not very saturated, but still fine to watch for the story.  The sound is clear mono (if it's stereo, as the box says, I couldn't detect it), with a little static in a couple places but otherwise OK.  The production values for a low budget film are pretty good.  There are at the moment a couple other editions available through Amazon, including one that a reviewer (Luke73) says is better (the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guilty-Pleasures-Media-Blasters/dp/B000BPL2I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guilty Pleasures/Media Blasters</a>&nbsp;release), so it might be worth the extra cash for you if you're particular.

Other reviews do a good job explaining the plot.  I'll just add that this is apparently pitched at a high school age audience but is well enough done for older folks to enjoy, if you go in for this kind of thing.  It's a romantic comedy/drama with some serious themes about death treated in a way that's very optimistic, to say the least.  I thought it had some originality, some good humor, no gaping holes that you can't fill in with a little effort, if you're so inclined.  Don't be put off by the singing that runs over the menu at the beginning.  The movie's better than that (though I do wonder why the singing ended up in it at all).  Despite what the box says, this is rated PG, has a ""family film"" feel, with just a little of what might be considered very mild adult situations.

If you like this one and want to see something with some similar themes, but pitched at a far higher level, try Truly, Madly, Deeply (unfortunately hard to find at the moment).",1159488000,,1872,4.945686900958466
2201277,3,B00076PCPU,"An extremely ""low-budget"" production only adds to the charm and innocence of this film! I seriously doubt that a movie of this kind could be made today because current audiences seem to expect and only respond to ""in your face"" entertainment. Somewhere Tomorrow is a truly exceptional film filled with magic and wonder! Highly recommended to viewers who enjoy simple, straight forward ""fairytales"" come to life. A great date movie and a very cool early 80's time capsule!

I would like to note that there are several versions of this film available on DVD. I am only familiar with the 89 minute release from ""Legacy Entertainment"". I'm mentioning this fact because the running times listed for this film range from 89 minutes to 91 minutes depending on which DVD you buy. I have yet to determine if there's actually 2 extra minutes of footage contained in the 91 minute version. My guess is that it has been time expanded or the production company is taking into consideration the ""menu"" or ""titles"" as part of the running time.

Unfortunately the transfer quality for the ""Legacy Entertainment"" version is very poor. I have not tried one of the other releases to compare quality. I would also recommend staying away from most other titles released by ""Legacy Entertainment"" because the quality can be quite horrible (worse than if you used an old VHS rental tape as the master).

I can only give three stars because of the poor DVD transfer.",1156377600,,1442,4.82995951417004
2201278,5,B00076PCPU,"Sarah Jessica Parker stars as a teenager having trouble getting over the death of her father. As this movie starts Lori is upset that her mother is considering getting married to someone else given the premature death of her father just a few years ago. All of that is put on hold when the girl witnesses a small plane crash while she is out riding her horse one day. She goes over to check on the two in the plane crash and gets help. After help arrives and she is dismissed - while walking back home - she discovers the pilot (Terry) walking though the woods. She takes him to the hospital to get him help and they have a great conversation -- only eventually she discovers that Terry is dead and she has been talking to a ghost. Both are shocked and Lori passes out.

Cut to a few weeks later she is sure she was dreaming or something but Terry shows up. He apparently went to his funeral and has discovered that she is the only one that can see him. Accordingly he needs her to contact his family etc. Also since it has now been weeks he is sure that she must play a role in the reason he has not moved on. So they embark on trying to figure out why he hasn't moved on and how to get that to happen. While the two try to do this they fall in love and also the goast helps Lori be a bit more accepting of her mother's decision to marry another man and to accept her dad's death.

Eventually the goast does move on and there is a great twist at the end that excellently explains how this girl could have been talking to a goast. It is also implied that she had this experience as a direct result of her dead father trying to send her a message about letting go. Additionally the pilot is not dead (although the plane crash was real) and Lori now has the opportunity to meet the real man and embark on a relationship with him.

This is not a fluf movie. I thought the scripting was thoughtful and accurate. For example when the girl first determines that the goast is real - she is scared! As anyone would be. He has to calm her down. Too many fluf movies such as ""just like heaven"" have the characters totally accepting of seeing a goast -- for plot purposes. Another issue that wasn't ignored was that Terry was older than her and he was aware of that. Both actors do a wonderful job. Sarah Jessica Parker was wonderful here.

I wish that Hollywood would remake this well with great stars of today such as Kirsten Stewart / Wentworth Miller. It was a truely smart romantic story with an unexpected message.",1143331200,,2509,4.231732776617954
2201279,5,B00076PCPU,I seen this movie years ago back in the 80's I seen it when it went straight to video. Its a cute Love story the boy Terry is played by Tom Shea i would like more info on him he is cute in the movie he only did 2 movies this one and Friday the 13th part 2 he was the only ones he was in? Wonder if anyone has any info on him maybe he quit show business. I wonder where he is now if someone has something on him please post or reply thanks.,1138060800,,439,3.5833333333333335
2201280,5,B00076PCPU,"I picked this DVD up for a dollar at a supermarket.  The sound quality is terrible.  It is so soft that I had to put one of my stereo speakers to my ear to hear it.  Hopefully when you buy it through Amazon you will get decent volume.

The plot fits in pretty well with all of the books about life after death, beginning with Raymond Moody's Life After Life and, even before that, Seth Speaks, and running right through to the excellent books by Michael Newton.  The premise is that after we die we leave our bodies and continue to exist.  Don't expect too close an agreement with those books, though.  This is, after all, just a story.  There is no claim to accuracy.

There is a plane crash.  It appears that both young men in the plane survived the crash, but then we see scenes indicating that one of the men died.  Sarah Jessica Parker's character is the only person who sees him, apparently as a ghost.  And she falls in love with him.

Why hasn't he gone on to Heaven, or wherever the dead are supposed to go?  Is he there to help split up the budding romance between Sarah's mom and her cop boyfriend?  Might he be there just to calm Sarah down about the upcoming marriage her mom is contemplating?  Sarah is deeply hurt by the possibility that her mom may forget Sarah's deceased father and marry another man.

There is a surprise ending.  I won't ruin it for you, but all I will say is that before you reach the last few minutes of the film, you don't know everything, or as Yogi said, It ain't over til it's over.

It's really a heartwarming story.  I disagree with the other reviewer on this site, who described this film as a bit of fluff.  It is more than that.  I also notice that the other reviewer gave it the same five star rating that I did, so perhaps he sees it as more than just a bit of fluff.  It's a beautiful story.

How close is it to reality?  We'll just have to wait and see, won't we.",1120953600,,1914,4.206611570247934

2201282,5,B00076PCPU,"SOMEWHERE TOMORROW

(1983)

Sarah Jessica Parker's first starring role. Romance weaves with the supernatural in this sensitive tale of a fate with circumstance. Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex in the City) plays a young girl, mourning over the loss of her father. Nothing it seems can break her sorrow. Fate intervenes one day in the form of a small plane crash that takes the life of a young man, who rather than ascending to the great beyond, finds himself still on earth and the object of Sarah Jessica Parker's affections. Together they must find out why he remains earthbound and unravel the mystery. Will answers be found ? Can love survive beyond death ? You will be touched by the answers as this compelling drama unfolds.

I'd guess the film is/was made for TV. Also look for Elizabeth Shue, in her film debut. A interesting note is Sarah Jessica Parker performs two onscreen songs in the film. (Not too shabby I might add.) One with her male co-star playing guitar and a solo accompanied by a piano. Basically, the movie is cutesie fluff, but very heartwarming and keeps you captivated as to what will occur. Could be very helpful for depressed children dealing with a family death.

2201283,5,B00076PCPU,"Sarah Jessica Parker was quite a versatile child actress and subsequently turned into a very good adult actress as ""Sex in the City"" proved.
In ""Somewhere Tomorrow"" she played the vulnerable Lori whose loss of her father in a plane crash has deeply affected her.
While her mother appears to be picking up the pieces of her life, dating the local Sheriff, Lori is struggling to come to terms with the changes going on around her in which she feels she has no control.
And the biggest change for Lori is the selling of the family horse farm and her mother's decision to marry again.
However despite all these many trials and tribulations Lori is about to fall in love herself but the only problem is, is that Terry the boy of her dreams, played by Tom Shea is a ghost!
His death in a plane accident has left him ""trapped"" on earth and the only person who can see him is Lori!
We are treated to a delightful series of escapades as Lori and Terry try to work out what is going on and during this time love blossoms between the teenagers.
This is a tender, gentle story about loss, love, forgiveness and moving on with ones life.
Sarah Jessica Parker is wonderful as the fragile teenager Lori and Tom Shea is delightful as her ghostly boyfriend Terry.
Look out for Sarah Jessica Parker singing part in the film, she has a really good voice and the song is lovely!
