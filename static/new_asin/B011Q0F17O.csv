7340329,5,B011Q0F17O,"I never watched this animated series when it was actually on, but my son is a huge fan of the trilogy. So with the passing of 'Back to the Future' day I thought this would make a cool gift since he's the right age for the series, (10).
He loves it! There are drawbacks, (most notably the absence of the voice work by Michael J Fox, and (which my son noticed) that Marty wasn't in every episodes, only some of them), but other than that he enjoys watching it.
It has science, it has history, and while not necessarily educational it's not a bad way to get some interest going.
It's campy, its unique, it was definitely worth the 30bucks or so that I spent.",1445990400,10,655,4.248
7340330,3,B011Q0F17O,"I had all of these recorded on VHS from when they originally aired on TV. I was so happy these were finally being released on DVD, because the quality on mine were pretty crappy. Unfortunately, they quality on these aren't much better, and some of the live action Doc Brown scenes are badly out of sync. The series itself is great...5 stars...but the quality of the DVDs is very disappointing.",1445644800,4,393,4.628571428571429
7340331,4,B011Q0F17O,"The main reason this is great for adult collectors to is to finally have an official release of everything Back to the Future ever (there have been a number of unofficial releases).  Hearing Mary Steenburgen and Tom Wilson reprising their roles is also a plus.  The only downside is that some of these stories can be really messed up, and that there's no clean-up at all on the animation.

Apparently it was a great series for kids when it came out (I was a teenager and had grown out of it),  and if any parents would love to get their kids interested in the movie trilogy, this might series be the key.",1445385600,6,604,4.366071428571429

8724885,5,B011Q0F17O,"An engaging collection of stories built off characters of 'Back to the Future III'. Mary, now in college occasionally visits Doc's family (wife, dog, and two sons) which results in adventures to the Civil War, medieval England, 'Land Before Time 2', Salem Witch Trials, Ancient Rome, Ben Franklin, the Incas and more.

Each episode includes an introduction by Christopher Lloyd as Doc and then the episode followed by a scientific experiment related to the episode done by Bill Nye. Biff's character appears in each time period to be the rival. Additionally there is usually a joke or a factoid. Engaging stories. Well done. Twenty four episodes which appeared  over two seasons. Entertaining and enlightening as it aspires to teach lessons.",1511827200,,741,5.166666666666667
