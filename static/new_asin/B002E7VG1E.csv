8366916,5,B002E7VG1E,"I really enjoy this workout before golfing, especially early tee times.  My initial thought was to rent it a couple times, memorize the routine, and just do it on my own.  However, I find the way that Todd explains the workout in relation to your golf game to be very helpful and his constant reminders and cues to focus on breathing and your body's sensations help me during the routine and echo in my head throughout the round to help clear my mind of those negative thoughts that pop up before a swing is initiated.  I have felt a big improvement in my back pain, and also seen an improvement on my score card and overall enjoyment on the course.  Highly recommended.",1453680000,,670,4.467213114754099

8366919,4,B002E7VG1E,I was given this a copy of this dvd by a good friend and liked it so much I purchased my own.  Great way to stay flexible and build strength and stability.,1372464000,,155,3.84375
8366920,5,B002E7VG1E,I am new to yoga and this DVD was do-able for me. I felt a very noticeable difference out on the golf course after doing the routine. I don't want to tell my friends but his DVD is my new secret weapon! I highly recommend this DVD.,1367625600,,231,3.9361702127659575
8366921,2,B002E7VG1E,"It is beyond me what the other reviewers saw in this DVD. There are a few nuggets mixed in that I have added to my routine, but for $33 there is little value here. In total there might be 30 minutes of content here most if which is just junk.

I purchased this because of the reviews and also because I was very disappointed with the first yoga for golf DVD I purchased from Katherine Roberts. At least that only cost me $11.

At the end of the day I wanted some simple yoga moves to help me gain additional flexibility that would help me with my golf swing. What I got was a 21 minute video of the author moving through a series of poses, that were voiced over for some reason - and not accurately in many places. There was really no rhyme or reason for the moves and explanation for what muscles you were working and why they would help. It was more about preventing injury that gaining flexibility.

All that said I do use a few of these moves in my routine now, so I will give some credit here. But what I have come to find is yoga moves are yoga moves. Some are more complex than others and there is no ""just one way"" to do them. Which ones help with your golf swing depends on where you feel tight or need more flexibility. Yoga is good for overall flexibility and like training your muscles, you would not want to just train one. You would create and unbalanced body. The same goes here. Yoga is good for your entire body - and mind...period.

Since both of these DVDs were a disappointment to me, I have since did a little reading and searching on You Tube and came across a series of yoga exercises put on by a young lady named Polly - including one specifically for golf. Search for yogapol and you'll find her series. She has a lot of energy and actually teaches you yoga moves. Using here videos I have developed a couple of routines that I can use on a daily basis or when getting ready to golf.

Do yourself a favor and check out her videos before you purchase any DVDs on yoga for golf. If you do decide to go that route, skip this one and keep searching. If I had to I'd probably rate Katherine's DVDs higher. At least there is some content and explanations - just a bit rushed for me.

Good luck.",1332115200,8,2213,4.183098591549296
8366922,5,B002E7VG1E,"I had back surgery less than a year ago.  A friend made me try The Golfer's Yoga Warm-up.  Did it make me a better golfer?  No.  But I did shoot my best and second best golf rounds (81, 83) ever at my home course in one week after using the yoga routine.  My golf skill has not improved, however I am able to swing easier, hit the golf ball further and duff fewer shots because of my improved range of motion.  Now I am making my friends try the Golfer's Yoga Warm-up.

8366923,5,B002E7VG1E,"After doing the Golfer's Yoga Warm-up I went out and played.  I felt looser than I ever have and really felt like I was able to let it rip.  I was hitting my drives 10 yards farther.  I will recommend it to all my golfing buddies.
