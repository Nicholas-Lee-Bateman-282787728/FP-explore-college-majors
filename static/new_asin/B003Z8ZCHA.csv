8410020,5,B003Z8ZCHA,"The second concert is terrible for any decent musical purpose beyond nostalgia.

The tape hiss on the first song of the first concert is rather loud.

The last three songs on the first concert really hit it home for me so I loved it to death.  The whole first concert is great to me.

If you do not have a very powerful sound system you might want to pass on this one if you like it loud.  I have a nice audio/video upconverter to 3D with lossless codecs pushing about 2,400 watts THX certified in 5.1 and 7.2 (across 9 speakers and two subwoofers) totalling 17 speakers.  It hits my rock concert kick value and the feeling is magical they had then and there.  You will pay too much for it but when you cannot get that song out of your head you know it was worth it and most nobody would agree perhaps.

The video is very much from its era but so much raw pure love shined through it really marked the sentiment in rock music at that time for me.

I was hoping that since this was from Germany it would be a superior quality recording.  I had always wanted  The Park live in Germany and when I saw this I was hoping for more.  My Robin Trower Living Out of Time is from Germany and it is THE best recording out of all perhaps, especially on the bass guitar.

Just try to think of the second concert as memorbalia or you will get mad.",1333756800,6,1333,4.12015503875969
