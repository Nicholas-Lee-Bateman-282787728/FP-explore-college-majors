8749222,2,B01B3O5I3A,This was the most rudimentary basic waste of an hour and 4 minutes ever. There were points when he was depicting a double time for technique and other than holding a second tompo in his opposite hand he did nothing with it. I could have made this video would just basic Kenpo and karate knowledge. Save your money you'll find better on YouTube.,1494979200,,344,4.476190476190476
8749223,5,B01B3O5I3A,"Rhys does it again, a fantastic training aid, I feel a lot more confident in my self, I keep 2 Tonfas in the house just incase as me and my partner do not like guns, I started practicing Rhys's first DVD ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defense Volume 1"" and I find this is even better because he goes into more detail.",1464912000,,310,4.183333333333334
8749224,5,B01B3O5I3A,"Great Training aid I love Rhys's ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defines System"" I really liked ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defense System Volume 1, Defense Against Guns, Knives, Bottles, Clubs and Unarmed Attacks"", but I think this one is even better because Rhys goes into more detail in this volume, the techniques are easy to masters with close ups, narration, slow motion, various angles and step by step guides, his style is also very effective. Rhys also mentions in an interview that his style is based on various martial arts he studied in his life especially Kempo Karate that he was taught for over 10 years by a British police office (and British police do not use guns so rely a lot on there fighting skills) who is also his current grandmaster. Rhys also teaches various fighting grips of the tonfas and how to change between them fast and effectively during combat, plus how to use 2 tonfas as a pair and single tonfa against various street weapons and unarmed combat including knives, bottles, clubs, grabs, chokes, punches and kicks, I can't wait to get his next training DVD ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defense System Volume 3, Kubotan and Torch for Realistic Street Self Defense"".God Bless and stay safe (With this DVD you will).",1464825600,,1232,4.871428571428571
