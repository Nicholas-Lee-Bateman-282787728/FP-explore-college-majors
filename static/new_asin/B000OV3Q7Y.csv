2799899,5,B000OV3Q7Y,After watching this movie on Netflix I had to buy it. One because after watching My Name is Khan I have become a fan of mr khan's work. And he did an amazing job for being his first feature film. One can't help to fall in love with him and character he plays in the movie. And second because I wanted to own his first film. He stole this film from rest of the cast. Without him it would not have been as good.,1378857600,,409,3.880952380952381
2799900,4,B000OV3Q7Y,"I purchased this DVD because Shah Rukh Khan is in it and because I liked it after I had already viewed the film. As with most Hindi films there is music, singing, and dancing emphasizing what goes on between the characters. This is a romantic story, lovely and blissful for awhile, but gradually greed, jealousy, and treachery enter in and have the romance leaning toward a tragic twist. This is when Shah Rukh Khan's character comes in, a wild mixed-up rich kid with a heavy dose of attitude and lots of reckless and hostile actions that demonstrated its power, but all that melted away like butter on a tray on a hot (seething hot)surface when he crashed through barriers into the path of his one and only for the first time. The transformation is awesome and entertaining. Until he can gain her attention, which is not easy at all, he is in erotic misery not able to grasp how being in love could be so bewilderingly painful and pleasurable at the same time. The action doesn't end there. It gets revved up more from that point onward. It's well worth the wait, if the blossoming lovely romance at the start of the film is not your cup of tea.",1370563200,5,1146,4.488038277511961
2799901,5,B000OV3Q7Y,"I love all of shahrukh khan's movies.  I'll collect any movie that has shahrukh khan in it.  Bollywood still knows how to tell a good, entertaining story...like Hollywood did in the past.",1356220800,3,187,4.8125
2799902,5,B000OV3Q7Y,"I purchased this DVD because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. This film is where he made his film debut. And he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He does not appear until half-way in to the film. This is a ""Must Have"" for anyone who is a fan of Shah Rukh Khan.",1334880000,3,265,3.6666666666666665

8186822,4,B000OV3Q7Y,"Deewana was Shah Rukh Khans debut film  thats why I wanted to see it. Rishi Kapoor is the nominal romantic lead, though hes a bit too portly to be convincing. But his acting skills are on display later in the storys conflicted drama. Shah Rukh Khan first appears in the second half with the song Koi na Koi, zooming into the story on a motorcycle, glossy black hair flying, leading his band of biker friends through Mumbai. He performs daring acrobatics on the bike, singing all the while (hopefully, its not filmed on the street!). His electrifying presence simply blows away any stodgy Bollywood conventions. His joyous, fluid dancing, passionate intensity and athletic grace make Deewana worth seeing. It even has the first instance of SRKs signature arms-open-wide gesture. From now on, Ill fast-forward to his entrance. And skim through the interminable fight scenes.",1469664000,2,872,5.055555555555555
