Present-day ruins are transformed into what the ancients saw & the amount of gold the ancient Egyptians used is unbelievable.",1358985600,11,394,4.984615384615385

Egypt is on my short list of countries I'd love to visit.
Most all archaeologists believe the first man appeared in Africa. Since Egypt is located in northern Africa, it was clearly one of the first highly developed societies and therefore, one of the most interesting.
One of the reasons this society was able to flourish was the fact it was located in the Nile River valley. The Egyptians were one of the first to develop a writing system, agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, medicine, and of course, feats of amazing architecture.
The History Channel's Planet Egypt has created a four-part miniseries that covers these areas and more. It explores its humble beginnings, the wars that took place and the peace that followed during its first 3,000 years as an empire.
I was especially interested in the religious aspect. After all, this was the dawn of man searching without the use of books for those paramount questions -- Where did I come from? Why am I here? etc.
Most of these early Egyptians were farmers, and therefore, felt connected to the land. Since they faced all nature could throw at them -- they called upon many different gods for help or for protection. When simple words would not bring relief they would add sacrifices. Eventually they would move to having Pharaohs (who actually ruled like kings) but were considered one of the more important of all the Egyptian gods.  They were to be mediators between the people and the gods.
This is a must-see for any ancient history buff.",1334620800,9,1574,4.847583643122676
