8148218,3,B000IZJROM,Starring Hema Malini and Dharmendra is a new version of Razia Sultana while starring Nirupa Roy and Jairaj is the old version of this movie. The seller was also kind enough to send a bonus. Razia Begum was one of the greatest Empress Queen of India but I was not aware of her private life while studying Indian History in my High School. The old version is full of old songs I came to hear for the first time. Resolution is not so great. However I did not expect to find anywhere I may have seen  and came as a surprise. It is played by very many of the veteran actors and actresses.,1483315200,,583,4.15929203539823

This movie tells one story of a great woman and how men are cheap, petty minded then as they are today.",1394841600,,256,4.711111111111111
