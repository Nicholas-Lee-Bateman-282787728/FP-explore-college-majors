8051160,5,B0007SOLD2,"Right now I am working on Week one, and waiting for weeks 2&3.  This one is weeks 4,5,6 and it is fantastic.  No bouncing, jumping or pounding the knees.  It's an old school type of workout like they did on those television workout shows in the 80s, only better.  These type of movements make you sweat more than the dancing type, not that dancing is wrong.  But more effort is put into this, thus you will burn more.  I looked at it first, then tried to do it.  There is a message on the tape - DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED WEEKS 2 AND 3.",1357776000,,554,4.074074074074074
