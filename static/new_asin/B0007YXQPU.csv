The video is so well done that I decided I needed to purchase my own copy. I highly recommend this video.",1188864000,10,281,4.320754716981132
8054301,5,B0007YXQPU,"I watched this on PBS TV, it is an excellent history of regional foods and very informative and interesting!  If you like to see food prepared and where it started, you will love this DVD, when it is released in late April, 2005. What really interested me was the settlement (city) in Texas that is almost entirely Czech and they hold a Kolanche (Pastry) festival every year.  I would love to visit them during that.",1113782400,14,416,4.533333333333333
