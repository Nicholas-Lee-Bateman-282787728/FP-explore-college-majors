I was intrigued by this kind of music coming out of Poland. I was pleasantly surprised. I love progressive Rock Music as. I am tired of all of the Anger Rock that is out now. I call it that because of all the screaming the singers do. I work in a factory and after listening to machines screaming in my ear, the last thing I want to do is listen to more of it on my drive home. I love the music this band is putting out. I have bought all of their albums and this DVD and I must say, it is worth every penny. I would buy their T-Shirts and swag if they had an English version of their website. I cannot speak Polish although my parents did when they were still with us. So if the band should ever read this .... please install an English merchandise link on your site. Thanks.",1375142400,,910,4.117977528089888
