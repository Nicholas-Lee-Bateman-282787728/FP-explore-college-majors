8341557,3,B001TIPPKC,"Grim, often brutal, film from director Ferzan Ozpetek about a ""perfect day"" in the life of Emma (Isabella Ferrari), a day in which everything that can go wrong does.  She is fired from her job at a customer service call center, a job she desperately needs to support her two school-age children.  Worse yet, for both her and her kids, is the reappearance of  her estranged husband Antonio (Valerio Mastandrea), an unstable, controlling, violent bodyguard for a corrupt politician.

In addition to the main storyline involving Emma, Antonio and their children, Ozpetek attempts to weave in several other vaguely-related plot threads:  a developing friendship between Emma and her daughter's teacher; the hostile relationship between the politician and his idealistic son; and the romantic attraction between the son and his young step-mother.  But none of these subsidiary storylines are particularly well-developed or well-integrated with the main theme.  The result is a rather confusing muddle of characters and scenes that don't seem to have much to do with one another.

The performances are generally good.  Mastandrea is terrific as the brooding, dangerous Antonio, a volcano waiting to erupt.  But the film as a whole is a bit of a mess.  Ozpetek is one of my favorite directors.  He has created some extraordinarily powerful, moving works, such as ""Steam: The Turkish Bath"", ""His Secret Life"" and ""Saturn in Opposition"".  Unfortunately ""Un Giorno Perfetto"" is not one of his better films.",1332115200,3,1496,5.261603375527426
