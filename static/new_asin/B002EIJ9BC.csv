8367797,4,B002EIJ9BC,"I'm actually the director of this feature, so when I saw that it was available for purchase on Amazon, I simply had to buy it. We knew we weren't making a cinema masterpiece when we made this; we simply wanted to make a fun movie for fans to enjoy. If you watch it for what it is, hopefully you'll enjoy it.",1434499200,2,307,4.049180327868853
8367798,3,B002EIJ9BC,"The only reason I am giving this three stars is that Eric Peter-Kaiser did a good job playing the main character, otherwise this is a 1 1/2 star film.",1384300800,,150,4.206896551724138
8367799,1,B002EIJ9BC,This was simply a really dumb movie. I often wonder why they bother spending money to make junk like this.,1376524800,,106,4.35
8367800,3,B002EIJ9BC,"why the F*** this mediocre flick is titeled 'Day Of The Dead 3' in my country is everybody's guess. Maybe it's because it's as 'good' as the quasi-remake or the unofficial sequel. Evilution is sometimes okay, sometimes unbelievably stupid... which justifies for me a 3 star-review. There've been a lot worse Zombie-flicks out there lately (Zombie Diaries 2 for example or Silent Night Zombie Night), but if you want quality gut-munching stick with the original Day Of The Dead. Cheers.",1330732800,,485,5.075
8367801,1,B002EIJ9BC,"I love a good zombie movie but this is one is really bad. From the very beginning its obvious the special effects are straight out of the cheesy made for tv genre, It looks like one of those super low budget poorly acted sci-fi channel movie marathon flicks. I was so bored with it I turned it off and came back later to finish it. Save your money.",1264809600,,348,4.132352941176471
8367802,5,B002EIJ9BC,"I really loved this movie. It had everything that makes a great zombie film fun! Gore, rabid zombies, characters that were over the top, and more gore! This movie is for fans of the genre, with more blood spills then I've seen in a long time. Its like 28 Days Later meets Dawn of the Dead, truth be told its a natural progression to have them evolve to a point where you can't simply run past them, or push them out of the way. Infected zombies running wild and killing anything that moves. These types of films are my guilty pleasures. Oh yeah, one of the best movie characters to come out in a film in a very long time makes his debut in this film, ""The Apartment Manager"". Wow! They need to do a movie with this guy! If you love zombie films, and I know if you are reading this then you do, you need to check out this film at all costs.",1261353600,4,839,4.090909090909091
8367803,1,B002EIJ9BC,yet another zombie/infected movie looks like this version they took a cue from that turd of a re-make Day Of The Dead apparently when you're infected you become a gymnast???!!! truly un-original and stupid avoid this piece of crap like the plague(no pun intended),1261267200,,263,5.0
