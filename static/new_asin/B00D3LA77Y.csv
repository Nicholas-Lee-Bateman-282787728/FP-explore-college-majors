Is it all too easy to see that this was actually one of my favorite seasons of The Ultimate Fighter? Well, hey, let me start by saying that I could really care less if it was one of YOUR favorite seasons. We all have our likes and dislikes for our own different reasons. But knowing that Jon Jones was one of the coaches was a plus for me. And BTW, this review comes ONE DAY after he defended his belt against the supposed unstoppable Daniel Cormier. You probably have your thoughts on that as well, not to mention the sportsmanship that ensued, but this is what I'm choosing to do.

So, Jon Jones coaches against Chael Sonnen. Quite frankly, who wouldn't want to do just that? Up to this point, these guys gave each other a lot of crap, and everybody knows how well Chael is capable of doing just that. But Chael was also capable of choking out ""Shogun"" Rua, and only Forrest Griffin did that prior. But these two are the coaches, and that's the way it is. And the fights to get into the house were pretty good. Oh, and Dana brought back the wildcard fight.

So, who are these fighters, and who are the ones who stood out the most? Well, maybe we should start with one of the favorites, simply because he was on Team Jones. Bubba McDaniel has trained with Jones, and he's got some skill. He's also got an attitude to go with that skill, and that attitude was one that wanted to win TUF #17 worse than ever. But he didn't. He was upset by the eventual winner, chosen as one of the wildcards, won THAT fight, but then got knocked out in less than 10 seconds by the runner-up. Some people had some nasty opinions about Bubba over his attitude. Let me tell you something...I liked the guy, and even though he isn't in the UFC anymore, he's more than likely fighting to get invited back. When Bubba showed emotion, I appreciated the man's tears, because they were truly genuine, and he truly wanted to win. There was Uriah Hall, and after his fight to get into the house, he scored a knock out that had jaws dropping left and right, and people were almost GIVING him the TUF trophy!!! He ended up being the Runner-Up in a close SPLIT decision after screwing around too much in the Finale, but nobody has forgotten who Uriah Hall is. Then you have the youngest kid in the house, Kelvin Gastelum. He took himelf seriously, he had a 9-5 job, then worked out for a few hours in the gym before this opportunity presented itself. Not a lot of people gave Kelvin much of a shot. After he got into the house, and I saw who he had to fight, I thought he was dog-meat. I just did. He proved everybody wrong. And he KEPT proving everybody wrong, winning the show!! He's still undefeated in the UFC, holding notable wins over Rick Story, Jake Ellenburger, and still as competitive as ever. You've gotta wonder who's actually going to hand this kid his first loss! You've got Dylan Andrews, who was picked last, but sure didn't fight like he was picked last! Oh, and then there was the overzealous Josh Samman, who knew who he wanted to fight, and why. He didn't win the show, but he won his fight in the Finale, and in his latest fight, scored a highlight reel head kick KO over one of the latest TUF Winners, Eddie ""Truck"" Gordon. Impressive, to say the least.

The Finale is one that was an eye-opener. Uriah Hall was supposed to run right through Kelvin Gastelum. Didn't happen. Bubba McDaniel opened up the Main Card with an impressive tap, but that's as far as his winning streak extended. Meisha Tate took on Cat Zingano in a FIGHT OF THE NIGHT war that had everybody talking. And you can't exactly say that the prelims were slouches either. Despite going down early in the competition, Clint Hester scored a KO that I thought should've been KNOCK OUT OF THE NIGHT, and not Browne's KO over Gonzaga.

I think that this season teaches us not to just count out the underdogs. I didn't think a thing about Kelvin when this thing started. Now? I can't wait for his next fight! I think in this season, people were counting a lot of chickens before they hatched, and they didn't end up hatching they way they figured. It also showed that just because 2 fighters aren't the best of friends, they still had the best interests at heart for these contestants.  And they didn't let their differences stand in the way of that. As far as the Finale goes? I think it also showed that you don't always have to have a Griffin/Bonnar war for a season to be memorable, but that heart and determination count for something. And for this, and many other reasons, I really loved Season #17 of The Ultimate Fighter! If you don't believe me, buy it for yourself, and see what you think.",1420329600,,4782,4.409966024915062

8589021,1,B00D3LA77Y,"Take a look at season one or season eight.  One star is generous in comparison.  Some of the fighters look like street people one would expect to find under that tracks on a subway in New York.  This has become the last refuge for many of the contestants.  It may add to the drama but a string of hard luck stories does little to motivate me to watch.  Also, after 20 years, one would think that Dana White could drop the F*** modifier when addressing the fighters.  In this day and age it is downright disrespectful and probably illegal.",1395100800,,538,4.383838383838384

8589023,5,B00D3LA77Y,"As someone who watched the original TUF season when it first aired, it's always interesting for me when a new season comes along. The chance at witnessing a new cast is great if for no other reason then trying to guess which contestants will go on to the UFC itself (if you're a solid fan you know that it's not just the winners of each season who go on to become successful fighters in the big league, look at the casts of season 1, 5, and 8 and you'll understand). Now, I'll be honest, I haven't been personally impressed with a season since 8, which has been a long time, and I haven't been able to follow along with any of the Brazilian casts so 17 came as a refreshing experience.

First off, production of the show has gone up in a big way. All you have to do is look at the one-on-one interviews from the fighters to see a new approach to how the show is run. It also doesn't hurt that the new format really goes well with an HD setup, which is why even combining this season with a blu-ray player should get across the kind of detail and picture quality you would expect out of an HD setup. Of course, this isn't the real reason why fans should catch up on the show. Reasons two and three are the biggest reasons for any season of the Ultimate Fighter to be checked out: the fighters and coaches. I haven't seen a cast with this much overall potential since season 8, where it really looked like the winner of the season was gonna be a hard guess. I have very little trouble seeing most of these guys somehow keeping themselves tied to the UFC in some way, hell, maybe even being legitimate contenders at some point. Another great facet to this year's season, of course the male drama is there but in this season there aren't the typical jerk(s) who stands out among the rest and create chaos. By that, I mean the cast is better focused on their talents as fighters than their personalities as human beings. Many of the past seasons have been more about the personalities of the fighters than the talents that are being trained. It's distracting and gets away from the point. It should also be noted that this is one of the rare seasons where the house the contestants were staying in didn't get destroyed in some way or another. Now the coaches, Jon Jones and Chael Sonnen. As per usual, these two are set up to coach against one another and then within the same month after the TUF finale they fight as the headline of a pay-per-view (although there have been exceptions in a few fights). Let me just say, first and foremost I have a whole new level of respect for both fighters thanks to their stints as coaches on this show. They did fantastic jobs. Thankfully, this is not one of those seasons where the personal feud between the two coaches becomes more important than the contestants on the show (Ortiz/Shamrock almost did this). It's easy to see that both men cared for their teams and attempted to train them in the best possible way.

Now, as for the fights themselves they are impressive. Many of these fights are all out brawls, technical ground fights, or quick finishes. I'd say, more often than not, the fights were fun to watch (which is more than I can say for most of the cards this year). Then to cap it off the season finale is actually one of the best events of the whole year. The fights between Miesha Tate/Cat Zingano as well as the finale (which will remain nameless for those who haven't watched the season) are incredible fights that are easily some of the best of the whole year. Thankfully enough of the prelims and other main card fights end in great fashion or have a solid pace to keep the night from being an overall snooze fest.

This particular TUF release is pretty good with most of the extras consisting of preliminary fights that took place during the finale, as per usual, with another few extras consisting of deleted scenes containing footage from interviews and the show of both teams.

All in all, I would say that this is a great release from the TUF collection.  Hopefully following seasons will continue to be just as good.  Since the next season is the first season consisting of both male and female contestants coached by Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate respectively, the UFC has the chance to make another outstanding season but only time will tell.",1371081600,6,4305,4.456852791878172
