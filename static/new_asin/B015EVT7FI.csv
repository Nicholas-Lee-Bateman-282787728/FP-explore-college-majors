7433703,5,B015EVT7FI,Very good movie with a terrifying ending. One of the few movies that not only subconsciously made me fear things depicted in this movie but also was engaging as a horror movie. Highly recommended.,1524009600,,196,4.794117647058823
7433704,5,B015EVT7FI,This film is creepy and I watched with anticipation. It had a twist I wasn't expecting and I recommend it as a good flick for this genre.,1523750400,,137,4.111111111111111

7433712,4,B015EVT7FI,"It's one of those slow-build, creepy and sinister films. Very slow pace. There's no twist, but there are some things to puzzle through, so keep your eyes sharp. I enjoyed it, but I also enjoyed the English Patient. Expect scenes that are more meditative than action-packed.",1511568000,,273,4.956521739130435
7433713,4,B015EVT7FI,I liked this movie a lot but I can't recommend it to most people. Watching little kids torturing their mother is too disturbing. But the premise is fascinating and the performances are wonderful.,1509494400,,195,4.9393939393939394
7433714,3,B015EVT7FI,We watch a lot of scary movies and this just wasn't scary. Its definitely psychological but not much of a thriller. We knew the plot but figured out the twist within the first ten minutes.,1509494400,,188,4.4
7433715,5,B015EVT7FI,"Watch this if you want to know how deeply unsettling window blinds can be. Coincidentally, Amazon features a wide array of draperies and rods and other non-blind window treatments to redecorate your house with. Not an entry level horror movie. If this is your first horror movie, I'd recommend checking out something else. This here is quiet body-horror like you would have had if Jonathon Glazer had directed Misery. It's drenched in a queasy stillness, a mood like rolling a snowball slowly toward a hill and then pushing it down the slope where it picks up speed and grotesqueness that you know won't end well.  Don't watch this if you have young twin boys or are seeing a psychiatrist for Imposter Syndrome. Side-effects may include excessive frowning and/or a need to fidget, especially the feet.",1509321600,,801,4.933333333333334
7433716,4,B015EVT7FI,"I absolutely loved it! Granted, I do watch a lot of foreign language films, so I'm used to European films which can seem a bit quiet compared to American films that have background music. I was hoping it would have been a bit scarier though. The trailer was a bit misleading, as it made it look like it was overtly scary and something more obviously stereotypical of a horror film. But the movie was indeed very, very creepy, and the slow pacing throughout the beginning and middle really contribute to the effect of the ending.

If you're into foreign films, cerebral thrillers and slow-to-build movies, I think you'll really enjoy it! If you're looking for something more ""scary"" then it's not really for you.",1508457600,2,711,4.733870967741935
7433717,4,B015EVT7FI,"Very creepy film with a very slow pace. It's also shot in a very plain, documentary style. Ultimately you will learn about the true nature of these twins--not everything, but enough to understand how they're really related. Once you realize the true situation, you'll begin to feel the true horror of the situation.

The problem, I think, is that we don't need to know more but want to know more. The mother and her two sons are secluded at this country home. Why are the boys alone before the mother returns? Why would any doctor or extended family leave a clearly unbalanced woman alone with two young boys with no assistance? We're left to assume that the whole movie is filtered through the boys' imagination.

That is, until the end. The viewpoint switches to the mother's view and slowly she realizes how cold and detached her children are--just like her. During this last half hour, the movie achieves its finest and most unsettling effects--so appalling and shocking that it redeems the slow pace.

The directors mention Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now as a major influence. To me, the movie seemed more like Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon or Cache.

The movie's ultimate theme is Death In Life, the understanding that some individuals never recover from life's most painful experiences. Isolation and disappointment lead them to chronic hostility and chronic malice.",1507161600,,1377,4.973913043478261

7433720,5,B015EVT7FI,This movie is one of the best movies I've seen this year! There is no category that I can put it in that is even comparable to the insanity of this movie!

7433726,5,B015EVT7FI,Beautiful. The imagery is captivating. The sound is outstanding. Beautifully cut and edited. The movie itself is awesome in its simplicity.

7433732,1,B015EVT7FI,"Very boring movie. I figured out the big twist right from the beginning, but I continued to watch because I thought ""there is no way that is the twist. That is too easy, too generic, too cliche"" and then holy sh*t I watch the whole boring movie all the way to the end and omg the twist that is so predictable. Very let down. Such a long build up to nothing.",1494806400,,357,4.042253521126761

7433736,5,B015EVT7FI,This film is very basic and doesn't have many actors in it. Nor does it really need many people because it gets not being able to decide who you believe. Till the last seconds you won't be 100 percent sure who's side your on.  this is a horror film that didn't get much publicity but does deserve it. If your looking for minimal gore and a nerve racking story line this is perfect!,1492819200,2,381,4.219178082191781

Third, Lifetime did a similar TV movie a few years back so once you know the potential plot, it is a bit easier to see where this is going.  THAT SAID. This was a pretty good movie. I love scary thrillers and drawn out plots - this one keeps you going until the reveal at the end. If you like suspenseful thrillers, this is a good one to watch.",1489449600,,476,4.096774193548387

7433744,5,B015EVT7FI,"i found ""goodnight, mommy"" to be very interesting.  it's about this woman who has identical twin sons.  her behavior toward them is odd because she talks to one of them and ignores the other.  she also has her face wrapped up for some unknown, at first, reason.  the story doesn't give much information in any kind of backstory, so it has unanswered questions.  the twist ending explains why she talks to only one of the sons.  since this is a foreign film, it has english subtitles.",1488240000,,483,4.558139534883721

7433749,5,B015EVT7FI,"Great underrated movie, but it is in a foreign language so captions are all throughout movie",1486080000,,92,4.8125
7433750,5,B015EVT7FI,"A clever and wicked film.  It centers around twin 11-year-old boys who cannot believe that their mother, who has recently undergone plastic surgery, is actually their mother.  At first, the suspense is barely palpable.  The twins' behavior and obsessions seem like typical little boy fare and it doesn't hurt that they have a puppy-dog cuteness about them (kudos for the excellent casting).  But their thoughts and activities become increasingly morbid and it is with this diseased mindset that they approach their ""mother"".  She becomes to them another experiment, another anomaly and you find that you are, like her, trapped in the malfunctioning mind of an 11-year-old.
Though the film is not perfect, there is very little I would change.  The setting is perfect for a horror of this sort - an isolated home with every modern convenience - and the director wisely focuses on the twins' perspective.  This is, above all, a horror film and many who are aficionados of the genre may find this falls short.  It is longer than the standard horror film, it has no genuine humor to it and it is not macabre.  It is mostly psychological - should you do a repeat viewing, imagine everything from the point of the mother (knowing what you now know) or from the point of view of one twin only.  Any way you approach it, you're apt to see the critical merit this film has garnered.
My only real fault with the film is its Hallmark-moment ending.  Anything (a mafia hit, a wild boar assault, anthrax, etc.) would have been better but that is just one thankfully brief scene.
Watch this if want something edgy (there are few films from a pre-adolescent perspective), something realistic (the twin's delusion is scientifically based) and something that, in the end, is both horrific and very, very sad.  This will not disappoint.",1486080000,2,1817,4.844660194174757

Throughout the movie, it was lonely and sad and full of despair. Which is, if you live it long enough, a type of horror. Even before I figured out the eventual plot twist, I knew for certain that something was tragically wrong with the bonds in this family.

If you're looking for the cheap weirdness that is the typical bedfellow of capgras-style horror movies, you won't get that at all. What you DO get however, is a really rich and tactile experience of the paranoia implicit in isolation and grief.

Not too long ago, I said something similar about the overrated 'Tale of Two Sisters'. At least that generated enough weirdness to be confusing.

SPOILERS:Two brothers are convinced that their mother, who has just had facial surgery and is unrecognizable under bandages, isn't their mother but has been replaced by someone else. They decide to get her to admit who she is and what they did with their real mother. END OF SPOILERS

This German film (with English subtitles) is a modest thriller but is a tad predictable at times (particularly if you're paying attention early on--I would suggest NOT reading some of the reviews here because they do have some major spoilers about some of the twists in the plot.

This features a pretty good transfer of the film and audio is clear throughout. The subtitles are large enough to read and are well done.

The acting is also fine -- it's just that the actors aren't given much of a script or story to work with, unfortunately. The story could have gone in several interesting directions (indeed, I was hoping it would!), but it never happened.

I don't mind films that take their time setting up a story, either, but this film never has a payoff for the slow pacing. It's too bad because this really could have been a fine film. i'd recommend skipping this one. I'm glad it was free on Amazon Prime streaming.",1475452800,,661,4.508333333333334

Some weird thing seemed to happen one night as she went walking, or it was someone's imagination. There was a lot if imagining in the movie. It 'appeared' that she was mean to the (twin boys?), who decided that she was actually,  not their mother. It was hard to see some of the things the (boys?) did. I wondered why the priest took the (boys?) home after they ran away and talked to him; and why he simply took the mother's excuse that she was stressed due to the accident. It was because of what he knew about the twins that was not revealed at that point in the movie. I don't want to give the movie away, but toward the end it is revealed why the mother started locking (the twins?) in the bedroom, at one point, saying don't make noise and they couldn't go outside and locked other doors in the home, as well. At the beginning of the movie, the boys were out and about, playing. Their mother played games with them; even though the boys had become curious about her during a guessing game they played with her. There's a twist to the whole twin brothers saga that is shocking. There's a reason why the priest took the (boys?) home after (they?) ran away and expressed maltreatment by the mother. The boys decided that they had to take matters into their own hands. They (the boys?) did terrible things after that. The end of the movie was quite revealing and shocking about the twins, and quite revealing about an accident mentioned in the movie and how the accident was tied into the movie;  also, a second tragedy.

It is glaringly obvious if you have half a brain that the Mom is fine the entire time and the kids' minds are playing tricks on them. Every seemingly odd thing she does has a reasonable explanation. I wasted 2 hours of this, waiting to be proven wrong. And in the end, they drop a pointless clue into what's going on (that doesn't answer anything) and end it in a way that makes no sense. It's like picking up a book, reading the whole story, being engrossed and then getting to the last page and finding it torn in half. That is this waste of a movie. Do not buy this or spend money on this piece of crap. It should be given away or someone should pay you to watch it.

The torture scenes perpetrated by sadistic twin boys are tough to take.  The atmosphere of the film is cold and emotionally detached despite the summer scenery.  As viewers, we never really connect  emotionally with the characters or learn to understand the ""why"" behind their mutually ambivalent relationship.  There is a twist in the story, but the truth behind the twist  becomes pretty obvious to any fan of scary movies pretty early in the film -- before it is actually revealed in the climax at the end.  The climax is unsatisfying.  It left this viewer muttering ""huh?  what just happened?  where were the adults?  weren't there any ghosts in this story? what else is on?.",1469577600,,804,4.746376811594203

The slow burn really seeps into your psyche making you question your own previous assumptions about the plot.

7434040,4,B015EVT7FI,"This is a great film, you're a little kid, your mother leaves you and your twin brother alone while she goes off somewhere and has plastic facial surgery, you run up to great her on her return and instead of embracing you in an I miss you hug, she's snaps at you and is nasty to you and your brother. Her face is hidden behind bandages, she doesn't really have a loving word to say to you at all, instead she tells you there's some new rules, one you must be quiet because mummy needs her rest, two you answer the door and get rid of the visitor telling them your mother is sick, three you must close all the blinds so there is no disturbing light as this gives mummy a headache. In the days that follow the mother who you knew is not the unloving woman who this bandaged woman living with you is. She is saying things to you that your mother never would. Where is your real mother? This woman knows, or is she even a woman at all or instead some alien, vampire or something who has done something to her and taken her place? You love your mother, you want her back, you've discussed it with your brother, it's going to be hard, it's going to be unpleasant, but you've got to do what you've got to do!

Some negative reviewers of this falsely label this movie as torture porn, They obviously haven't seen it as there are no sex scenes, or anything shoved up anywhere or well anything to do with porn. Almost the whole movie only has the mother and her two kids in it. Others think this isn't a good film because they worked out some things before the film ended or even early on. Well there were a number of deliberate clues, so really it's not surprising that they did. Be more surprising if they didn't at least suspect something. You don't have to be blindsided by something at the end of a movie for it to be effective.

I will say though I did think the Red Cross part of the film was completely unrealistic which is why I dropped it a star in rating. Spoilers follow regarding their scene - It could have been plausible if they had seen a glimpse of a child in the house and they had become concerned the child was alone or something was wrong like the parent was unconscious or something and they entered shouting, hello are you okay, or do you need help. But just barging in without seeing anyone after trying the door, walking around and then when you get caught not leaving until you get a donation seemed a bit ridiculous. I could even understand the not leaving part if they were concerned there was no adult living there, but they leave once they get some cash (probably as they know if an adult was there they wouldn't get that much). The whole Red Cross part of the movie wasn't necessary at all for the plot and just had you screaming inside your head as if this would happen!

But overall this was an interesting movie. If you don't mind reading a good movie (it's spoken in the German language with English subtitles), then this Austrian movie isn't a bad thriller.",1468627200,,2983,4.304270462633452

A strong opening devolves into a glacially paced slog through ""ambiguities"" that are constructed with utter transparency - at least to the cinematically savvy. In fact the big twist in the torture-porn finale actually seems to flatten what's left of our interest in the picture - perhaps because we were hoping that there was some OTHER twist up the filmmakers' sleeve(s) we hadn't been anticipating!  Oh, well. One last ""ambiguity"" caps the final shot - if you care (I didn't). My advice is watch the trailer - it's much better than the movie (and contains most of its best moments). Still, points for the icily slick art direction and the often-evocative cinematography.

This is one of those slow burn films in which you really just have to pay attention and soak it all in. It isn't terrifying, but its eerie enough to keep you entertained and seriously intrigued.
I enjoyed it, but not immensely so. It does re-intstill my weariness of childrenespecially twins. Ha. But they just did what they had to do, and to me its oddly admirable. I don't think they smiled once the whole movie, and to see such apathy in people so young is highly interesting. The ending has a really nice twist too, so its worth sitting through to find out!

7434186,3,B015EVT7FI,"I was torn between three and four stars. I wish there was a three and a half option, but I finally had to go with three despite the fact that I do recommend it in a way. Such is the problem with using a quantified rating that way. Oh well.

First, this was a very well made film. The plot proceeded with finesse and patience without the pacing becoming too slow. The performances of the two main actors were fine and the script's idea may be a good one if done a little differently. As it stands, there were a few problems that sucked all the enjoyment of watching it from me that I simply couldn't ignore. I wound up leaving the film in a state of annoyance, which I'm certain wasn't the intention.

For one, there are a lot of issues that are hard to point out with how Susanne Wuest's character acted. It's particularly difficult to go into without spoiling the film. But this mother of twins (or maybe not) that comes home from the hospital after an accident simply isn't very believable. And it's not the actress' fault, as she gave it a valiant try and I have no complaints about her performance; the trouble is built in to the script itself.

I speak of spoiling the film, but that's pretty pointless to worry about when you're likely to guess the film's secret not fifteen minutes in, and can predict the ending before you're halfway through the film. It's not that this particular twist *must* be a surprise for the story to work, but when they take so much care to be cagey about it throughout in an obvious attempt to keep you guessing and they fail so hard, it's irritating.

And when things take a turn in the third act, there's a sudden character change that's jarring and feels false. I get what they were trying to do and I respect the attempt, but particularly when I already had the previous problems with it, it was hard to accept this.

It made for something of a frustrating experience and overall a disappointing one. Despite this, I do think this is one thriller that horror fans should see at least once. There is enough that's good about the overall production that makes certain aspects very effective that it's worth sitting through the one hour and forty minute run time.",1462924800,2,2199,4.460199004975125

7434211,4,B015EVT7FI,"I really liked this film.  I know that non-German speakers will probably have a hard time and not want to read sub-titles, but fortunately there isn't an overwhelming amount of dialog.  Since I used to live in Austria 20+ years ago and virtually have no exposure to Austrian Deutsch in the US, I enjoyed the practice (though I admit I had to read some of the sub-titles).
Even if you are not a sub-title reading kind of viewer, I would recommend this.  I wasn't really sure where to go with this film.  Was the mom really evil?  Was she just suffering from post surgery pain?  Was she not their mother at all, as the boys suspected?  The twins seemed so innocent and I wanted to protect them.  Basically, there were really only the three characters,  though a few others made appearances. Each person played his/her role well.  You could tell which twin was the dominant one.  Even though you never saw the mother pre-surgery, you understood that her demeanor had changed.  Though this Is not your normal blood and guts horror movie, it is none the less unnerving.  There is a sincere lack of distractive noise, which I think adds to the story. You don't feel the immediate need to flee, though what you are witnessing is uncomfortable.  Are the characters wrong in what they are doing?  You're not exactly sure.  You almost feel like you are perhaps the neighbors or casual observers, and want to help, but feel you don't have the complete story and don't want to act too quickly.  I was surprised by the ending.  Even if you do not like foreign films, give this one a shot.  I think you'll be intrigued.",1461196800,,1605,4.548951048951049

7434216,1,B015EVT7FI,"This is, unfortunately, one of the most unoriginal films I have seen in quite some time, that has attracted such high critic reviews. I am still baffled by how much positive press this movie has received. Goodnight Mommy is one of those films that you keep waiting to see why everyone likes it, but it never delivers.

First off, the pacing of the film is beyond slow. I have no problems with a film taking it's time to tell a story, but the story and it's presentation has to be good. This film is adequately shot, but the story has been done a million times before, and done much better.
The ""twist"" is never a twist at all, because you know what it is withing the first 10 minutes of the film. If it was any more obvious, it would be a giant subtitle at the bottom of the screen. I was waiting on some different ""reason"" for this twist, that would set this film apart from others like it, but it never came.

I've read reviews stating that this is the most terrifying film they've seen in years. I'm not sure where that is coming from, because I've seen Scooby Doo episodes that are more psychological than this! If I can give this film any praise at all, it would be that the two boys do a great job acting in it. That's all. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. I simply don't get the hype it received, and I am a lover of all types of film.

Instead of Goodnight Mommy, I would recommend you check out the South Korean film, A Tale of Two Sisters. It has a similar premise and is done masterfully, as opposed to this overrated film.",1460419200,5,1541,4.23469387755102

7434224,1,B015EVT7FI,The first clue the film makers are not playing fair with the viewers is the fact that two young twin boys have been staying alone for some time in the family house.  When it finally dawns on you that manipulation is the game you realize nothing in the plot is logical.  The mother could have saved us all a lot of time by simply answering the question put to her thus saving us from the illogical histrionics that follow.  Unfortunately (or fortunately) this film reminded me of a film worth watching:  Runaway with Aaron Stanford and Robin Tunney. A young man kidnaps his young brother and runs away to keep his brother from being sexually molested by their father.  In Goodnight Mommy when the sad reality is revealed at the end it is maddening.  I felt cheated out of my time and money.  In Runaway the ending leaves you quietly devastated.,1459555200,,843,4.543046357615894

Early on in this movie I could tell this about Lukas. I got distracted and kept looking for clues to prove my suspicion; I was also waiting to find out how Lukas had died. As someone else commented; this movie also reminded me of ""The Other"" which really freaked me out as a child (especially the baby in the pickle jar). The ending really surprised me as I thought maybe Elias would end up in a psych ward or because he's a juvenile, he might get away with it. Special effects were minimal and I'm still trying to figure out why the mom went out in the woods; I thought she was going to turn into a werewolf, based on her head-shaking movement.",1459382400,,832,4.339743589743589

Once you have seen a Tale of Two Sisters - all movie plots like it become obvious from the beginning. Once you saw the mother ignoring Lukas, you new he was dead.

7434320,5,B015EVT7FI,"I passed this one up multiple times because I suspected the typical American ""horror"" that I've come to find in movies centered around children: PGish flair for melodrama and not much else. Then I saw it was a foreign film and gave it a shot. Man, this one slammed it out of the park! Excellent camera work and acting. With the exception of a couple of brief visitors, it was a 3 (wo)man show, and those 2 kids really carried it. Outstanding! I don't want to neglect the mother, who played her part so perfectly enigmatically. She worked me. I didn't know what to think of her and each aspect that she portrayed was entirely credible and effective. I loved the house, which itself became a character. The tight script and the razor sharp focused story line developed excellent suspense and tension that paid off big dividends at the end. I didn't see it coming and I am so glad! This film brilliantly straddles horror and psychological thriller, creating a mystery for the viewer (me), something for my mind to chew on, with plenty of sensory stimulation both consistent with and transcending the horror genre. Its a mature movie, despite the child oriented storyline.  The pace and tone is slower, more subtle and artful, much like other European films I've seen, in the vein of Swedish, Germanic, and Danish cinema. Like a poem, it requires actual attention and patience, but it earned my patience quite organically- no effort or work required. It quickly morphed into anticipation. So: gratification without the ""instant"". There was definite artistry in the visuals. The cinematography was aesthetically beautiful. In so far as music goes, the ""favorite song"" was an excellent touch. While the buildup may be slower compared to what you get with typical American movies, it worked beautifully to develop the tension until that moment when it punches you in the gut and doesn't let up. Nothing gentle about it at all. As I'm writing this description of my experience, ""Antichrist"" comes to mind (Lars von Trier). Entirely different story but a similar experience for me. I'm glad I didn't see this one any sooner, as I've been jonesing for a really good, satisfying movie in this genre. Great job, filmmakers and actors! I would buy this and watch it again. There is something quite ""classic"" about it.  Foreign horror today is far more reliably gratifying than American horror anymore. I hope these films are successful so more are distributed internationally for my viewing pleasure. As you can see, I can't say enough good things about it! I hope I don't over inflate any expectations, as its all very subjective. Just know its a quality film.",1457740800,32,2648,4.856194690265487

7434381,3,B015EVT7FI,"DO NOT READ THE PACKAGE FOR THIS MOVIE'S SYNOPSIS (It is a 100% false description of the film and 100% misleading, probably on purpose so the ""big twist"" isn't obvious) Having said that here is ...a REAL SYNOPSIS that is helpful and doesn't mislead or spoil anything: In a remote house, a family shattered by tragedy, tries in vain to cope with the aftermath of an accident. The matriarch attempts to maintain control after returning home from reconstructive surgery, while she and the remainder of the family spiral downward with the changes brought on by loss.
OK... now my review. I have to start off by saying, there were 5 of us watching this last evening (all movie buffs, no one bothered by reading subtitles, yes it's a foreign film). We watched the trailer first. It is very misleading and if you've seen it and the film looked interesting (as it did to all of us) please re-read MY synopsis. The trailer is cut to make the film seem very different than it actually is. If you're expecting something possibly supernatural, don't. This is normal, everyday, run of the mill horror that could happen anywhere. I'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to put such an obviously false trailer or synopsis that is a complete lie, but it is. The film itself is well acted, nicely shot, filled with strange camera angles and loaded with mood. If all 5 of us hadn't felt so completely mislead by the description, we probably would have enjoyed it more. As it was, no one wished for their hour and forty minutes back but at the end (even though a few of us figured out what was going on and weren't thrown off by the lying red herring of a synopsis), it was still a let down. I think you may find it more enjoyable than we did if you just ignore the BS on the back of the package and disregard the trailer filled with things that either don't happen in the film or are cut to look like something else is going on. The movie is good but beware of the untrue crap they're trying to peddle in an effort to throw you off the ""shocking surprise"". Last thing... it's pretty disturbing near the end so be aware of that if you're bothered by realistic and terrible stuff happening to people.",1457136000,3,2180,4.466165413533835

7434418,1,B015EVT7FI,"I adore horror, I live it, I breathe fear.  I love the suspense, the possibility of what can and will happen.

Goodnight Mommy is a German (English subbed) movie about creepy twin boys (worked in The Shining) and a bandaged mother, the boys somehow come to the conclusion that the bandaged woman isn't their mother, hi-jinx ensue.

That's about it, the whole movie summed up in so few words.  The movie was made to be arty, pretentious it is made to be edgy and arty, and many people enjoy it, critics eat it up.  I do not.  A five minute scene with boys running and playing in fields with no dialog or effort to move the story forward is someone's home movies, it is filler nothing more.  The movie is packed full of said arty shots, like a pointless scene where the bandaged woman goes out of the house and strips naked in the woods to re-enact her favorite scene from Jacob's Ladder it is pointless.  This movie bored me to no end.  The ending was alright but I pinned the twist but a few minutes in.  Honestly you could probably gut most of the movie and shove it into an anthology of some sort and have it play out much better with real tension.  As it stands if you don't like art house films, don't bother, if you want actual horror, go elsewhere, if you are not big on torture movies pass this up.  It didn't appeal to me in the slightest in the form of a superb narrative horror movie.",1456790400,,1394,4.278625954198473

What made this a ""thriller"" or ""horror"" is solely its garden variety gore and violence; the type of gore so many other modern gimmicky movies use in order to be considered ""horror with a twist"". This one digs into the ""scary kids"" jar by placing children into the prominent roles - a horror go-to perhaps not as played out as vampires or zombies, but played out nonetheless.
But the biggest problem with this movie is the utterly horrible character development - this is especially bad given the fact that the entire premise rests on just such development. We are told almost nothing about the backstory, yet the film makers want us to care about the actions which take place because of that backstory. But I just didn't care. The cast were 2 dimensional and utterly forgettable. So in short: it's exceedingly slow, there's no character development, totally unbelievable relationships, and dime-store gore/violence. Just a dumb, pointless film; one star for cinematography, which is clean, well-thought out, and well suited for a horror or suspense film -- had this been either one of those.",1456704000,2,1262,5.014285714285714

7434453,4,B015EVT7FI,"This English-subtitled art-house film is filled with frames that will stay with you well after the end. The filmmakers choose to let silences, quiet voices, and people-less landscapes suggest the inner mysteries that haunt this traumatized family. I kept thinking how the mother, who wears surgical bandages on her face through the first half of the movie, resembles the female leads in Ingmar Bergman films. And her twin boys, their thin bones like the angled house, are as starved for attention and stimulation as abandoned orphans. Their father never appears, having split with the mother in the recent past. They spend their time alone with each other, and their collection of enormous black beetles that wriggle and writhe, and sometimes escape, the only pets the boys manage to hide in their dark bedroom.
  The entire film is shot in shadow; even sunny days look ominous. The huge house, decorated apparently to reflect the artistic sensibilities of spare, cold, colorless modern art, bears no sign that it is inhabited by children. We are immediately sympathetic to these lost boys. In an early scene, their bandaged-wrapped mother, who calls to mind the unnerving face transplants in the classic Italian horror film Eyes Without a Face, plays an actual game with the twins in an attempt to re-establish a connection with them after her long hospital stay. But that's about it for maternal warmth. Her manner is so cold and removed that the boys suspect that she is not their real mother. Her scary bandages serve to support their fear and dread. The feeling of dread is so pervasive, in fact, that you can sit and watch the film while nothing much seems to transpire, and feel your heart beating in your chest as you await some terrible moment that you intuit must be coming around the next corner.
  The journey of the boys as they attempt to discover this woman's real identity has us squarely on their side; her cruelty and lack of warmth has us rooting for the truth to be revealed. The filmmakers will drag us through some horrific scenes before they peel the bandages off the truth of this odd family.
  Don't be put off by the subtitles. The dialogue, like everything else in this film, is spare and quiet. These scenes and characters will stay with you long after the final haunting tableau has faded to black.",1456531200,,2327,4.819548872180451

STOP IT. These types of endings are lazy and stupid, and 99% of the time, they ruin what was otherwise a really solid movie. ""Normal"" viewers may be shocked by it, but Horror fans are sick of it. It's literally been done to death. Please do better next time.

I only watched this movie because of the extremes in reviews. Had to see it for myself. I hated it. Some posted ""you have to watch it twice to see all the clues."" No way. The ""disturbing"" part wasn't hard for me to watch, I am more confused of how this type of torture to confess manifested in Elias's head.

I'm lost as of why the mother didn't say more to prove who she was, which with the ending it's telling us it really was her......

What am I not getting here? Reading the high reviews it feels like you watched an entirely different movie than me. Either we have really different tastes or this one went right over my head.

I got the ""twist"", I got the mothers ""strange new behavior"" being questioned. I understood the mothers frustration and maybe guilt of Elias still talking to his twin.

I don't get the significance of the cockroaches. Or blurred pictures. I need help with this one. Slow, slow, slow. Not much dialogue, just a strange flick.",1456185600,2,966,4.435028248587571

But many illogical fallacies raised red flags from the get-go (e.g., who's watching the kids while mommy is having face surgery? What is this deep source of conflict between mom and progeny? Why does she allow certain behaviors to persist?)...  The big horror moments were more gross than terrifying, and fairly ridiculous in the context of the film.

And both have a dead one. But the difference is that with Goodnight Mommy, instead of just being scared, you get to watch a woman tortured, and that's what movies are all about these days.

It is very slow movie, with a lot of twin boys interacting between each others and with their mom, they suspect something is wrong since mom did face surgery and now her face is covered with mask. With movie progressing the interactions will progress and very quickly they turn very ugly. The end is VERY unpredictable.
Again, there are no scary jumpy scenes, but a few gruesome scenes of torturing of a human being.
SPOILER ALERT! For those who do not want to watch this great, but slow pacing movie, the description is:
There is no evil or criminals involved. In the very end you will learn that one of twin brothers and their father died in car accident. But survived brother denies it and still play and talk to his brother and suspect something wrong with their mom since she is ignoring one of the brothers (dead one), does not cook food for him, does not talk to him and punishes alive brother for playing and listening to imaginary brother. It explains her face surgery, her depressed mood. It explains why priest did not call police when twin brothers asked for help and explained what is wrong with mom, but instead he drove twins back to mother. Finally, they all die in house fire caused by kid who still tried to ""uncover conspiracy"" - where is our real mom?! Very-VERY sad movie, but very-very well done!

The way it's shot is long and melodramatic to where you can honestly tell the directors were trying too hard.  The performances were unrealistic and far fetched.  No child acts like that.  The red cross people just walking in (breaking and entering) really hurt the film and was so unrealistic.  The ending,  while smart wasn't worth it.  You could really tell the directors were trying to make the film too artsy so they knew that reviewers would eat it up and that's exactly what happened. but to a regular viewer it comes off beyond fake and full of itself.

Hats off to the director on shooting something that was so vivid that, from my 14'' laptop, I was still having very visceral reactions. The three focus characters of this story were all super fascinating and well-acted by the actors. My only issue I had with the film (unfortunately, I do believe it could've been a homerun) was that while the overall look of the film certainly pays off for the minimal dialogue, there was NOT enough backstory to really give this story bite. I still didn't know who these people were or what the hell happened for them to get there by the end of it all, but it was pretty sick -and by sick, I mean awesome- to watch.

It always creeps me out when they have children carrying out torture, etc.  I watched the entire thing and hated the ending.  Was she the real mother or an imposter?  Where was the boy's father while this was going on?  I was sorry I wasted my time.

I had to think about it for a couple of days and decided they really did a good job on the making of this film. I couldn't give it five stars simply because it was so disturbing. I thought initially it was strange because it was foreign but it was very accurate in the depiction of the family dynamics, sibling (especially twins) behavior, and serious dysfunction. This would be an excellent film for a group discussion -- kinda like a book club thing -- lots to talk about without question.

7434934,4,B015EVT7FI,"The basis for the horror in this movie is comparable in conception to one of Stephen King's ideas. By which I mean that the person or persons who conceived this idea started with a fear that would normally reside in the background, in the back of one's mind, and amplified it. A fear that has had occasion to pop up especially in the mind of anyone who has kids, in particular in the mind of anyone who has ever had to deal with an unruly kid or kids, and most glaringly in the mind of anyone who has found themselves in powerless positions alone while failing in coping well with said unruly kid or kids. Goodnight Mommy attempts to turn this fear onscreen into something no longer dwelling in the shadows unacknowledged but leaping forth and blooming into a factual occurrence in true life reality, and what an excellent attempt it is too. How highly ironic that this occurs within the context of a fictional work, a movie. Yes, indeed this no conventional horror flick. The pace is slow at first, then picks up speed once the nature of the twin mysteries around which it revolves resolves. There is no single reveal of its secrets to the audience, but rather a series of reveals, some of which turn out to be false because the movie deals throughout with the theme of two (or more) people will have two (or more) perspectives, often wildly different, on the same event. Also not every perspective a person has will be true, we have to revise some of our perspectives as we discover the truth. But how are we to discover the truth if we believe our main source is lying to us? As for the gore, the context in which it occurs is the glaring spotlight catapulting the mere acts themselves into an ultimate fear come true, a taboo nakedly violated seemingly without interference of the conscience. Certainly this is no movie for the faint of heart; you know what is coming and Goodnight Mommy dares you to stare it in the face and watch it while it comes. Oh, and the end isn't the end.",1454371200,,1985,4.471074380165289

7434937,4,B015EVT7FI,"I love horror movies... I can watch any amount of ghosts, vampires you name it.... but this scared the beejeesus out of me. I particularly love foreign/European horror movies.  Had heard good things about this so it was with great anticipation that I sat down with my 15yr old horror movie loving step daughter very late last Saturday for our weekly scary movie night. A longtime fan of Argento, Fulcci et al, I was fully expecting to have to update my step daughter while she peeked from behind a pillow and we would have a jolly good chuckle as usual.
It is a beautifully atmospheric movie, and you are totally sucked in by the situation the twins (who are OUTSTANDING in their rolls, btw) are in...and that's all I'm going to say about the plot -  to compare it to other movies would spoil it. I felt terribly smug as I worked out what I thought was the twist early on, but the movie didn't pivot on that. The tension mounts subtly yet inexorably.  It blindsided me a bit later and, call me a wussy, it really got under my skin, so much so that for much of the latter part of the movie I couldn't watch - I hid in the kitchen while my highly amused step daughter called out updates. This has NEVER happened,EVER.
I blame becoming a mum - I can't distance myself from it anymore while watching a movie. I'm not even sure I was scared or just super disturbed by it.  My fragile lady feelings aside,  this movie is terribly unsettling; little too realistic yet maintaining a dreamlike quality. All concerned are fantastic in their rolls, evoking sympathy, fear, revulsion, rage...well at least from this viewer. There are some ""huh?"" moments, and some matters remain unresolved, but perhaps I just missed some vital moments when burying my head in my hands/pillow/dog.
Hardly lite viewing, it's not a movie to watch if you are having a bad day.  Would I watch it again? Probably not. But I am glad I (almost) watched it once.",1454284800,6,1925,4.517241379310345
7434938,1,B015EVT7FI,"I love movies about identical twins.

I especially love them when the twins are played by real-life twins, instead of one person playing two roles, so I really wanted to see this movie.

I hate subtitles, but I wanted to see this movie so badly that I watched it anyway.

I also thought that the mother-imposter idea was really interesting.

But . I did not enjoy this movie at all.

This movie was terrible and just kept getting worse, it was boring, disgusting, and way too slow.

S P O I L E R 

Have you seen the movie titled ""The Other""?
It is the story of identical twin boys, played by real-life identical twin boys.

This movie is a rip-off of ""The Other"", only it is a very poor copy.
If you want to see a really good story, then watch ""The Other"" instead.
And, ""The Other"" does not have disgusting scenes like this movie does.

I recognized this movie as a copy of ""The Other"" within the first few minutes.
The plot in this bad version is so obvious that, if you never saw ""The Other"", then you probably still would guess the ""twist"" right away.

For those of you who want to know the twist-secret, I will tell you
It is the story of identical twin boys.
One of the boys was killed in an accident before the movie opens.
The surviving twin cannot deal with the loss of his brother, so he pretends that his brother is still alive.
He pretends so often and so strongly that he actually goes insane until he actually does believe that his brother is alive, by actually seeing him and hearing him, having conversations with him and doing things with him, etc., by insane delusions and hallucinations, and he cannot understand why other people cannot see his brother like he can.  He believes that there is something wrong with everyone else.
In ""The Other"", the whole town knows that the boy is delusional, and they all play along with it because they don't want the responsibility of pushing him over the edge to complete madness by forcing him to face the fact that his twin is dead..but it is too late, because the boy has gone so completely insane that he begins to kill people because of his deep anger, and he even believes that his twin did all of the killing instead of himself.",1454284800,,2192,4.385185185185185
7434939,3,B015EVT7FI,It was just k,1454284800,,13,2.5
7434940,5,B015EVT7FI,"Ok.  Just to start out, I'd like to warn you that I confidently had this movie figured out after 12 minutes.  No joke.  I'm normally good at things like that--but in this case I think I was given a little too much a little too soon to piece things together a bit too prematurely.  Now, hey, I still enjoyed this film.  But something like this could spoil some people's movie experience.  On with the review

When first meet the identical twins, Lukas and Elias (Lukas and Elias Schwarz), they are refreshingly playing outside as young boys once did before the advent of videogame consoles, Netflix and the internet.  They are clearly the best of friends and do everything together from hide and seek to burping contests on their large family farm estate in the countryside.

After returning home to recover from a terrible accident that initially goes completely unexplained, their unrecognizably bandaged mother (Susanne Wuest) is not greeted as warmly as she'd like--hardly a kind word is exchanged after the boys coldly deny her so much as a welcome home hug.  Clearly any children would be shocked to see their mother's face obscured by gauze.  But this is more than that.  In that moment, Mommy earns audience sympathy while being dehumanized in the boys' eyes.  It is evident that the boys doubt that this is, in fact, their mother standing before them.

Mommy makes her best effort to return to normal, but something is off.  One twin (perhaps more disrespectfully than fearfully?) doesn't speak directly to Mommy but rather whispers in his brother's ear and, as a result, he is treated unfavorably.

More  things hint that something is off.  Mommy insists that she will not see visitors, the boys refer to what dad lets them do but he is never seen or mentioned otherwise, and Mommy essentially never even acknowledges the other brother as if implementing some form of extreme silent treatment.  The boys' somewhat surreal dreams convey the intensity of their distrust and other little hints (or red herrings?) abound, but I won't ruin any of it for you.

As the story endures, the boys' distrust only amplifies and so accordingly does Mommy's impatience for their acceptance--which is never directly addressed.  Their fantasies depict her as a something monstrous and inhuman--meanwhile they literally pray for the return of their ""real"" mother.  Ultimately, the boys and Mommy turn to extreme measures and the film shifts from psychologically uneasy to brutal.

The greatest fault of this film--other than its blatant predictability--was that when the time came for it to reveal the truth, it just sort of ""tells us.""  As a whole the film still worked for me, and I'd even recommend it to anyone in search of something different from the horror genre; a change of pace.

But realize that to some, this flaw may not be considered as forgivable as it was to me.  Furthermore, I was delighted by the editing, cinematography and splendid acting.  This was the first feature film for writer/director team Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala and I'm thrilled to see what they do next. There are some intense scenes, just a few with blood, mostly involving the threat or act of domestic violence.  But we delve briefly into torture porn during the dental floss and super glue scenes.

This film is slow but stimulating, delicate yet brutal, and simultaneously sympathetic and cold.  Some may comfortably pick whom to trust, but I found my sympathies indivisible across the tortured family.  I'd call that a victory.",1454284800,,3515,4.9268707482993195

Not as exploitative as some, but longer than most (save Martyrs). I became bored/bothered with the violence, skipped ahead, and saw the ending I expected (though the manner differed some).

In the early movements, it presents a world we cannot entirely trust; this intrigues us. But it punishes the viewer for a third of the film before delivering a less than shocking twist. Stylistically, I appreciate much this film has to offer; I don't shy away from violent films, but I stopped watching this because I found the incremental violence frustrating and unpleasant.",1454284800,,720,5.0

I'm left wondering if there was some secondary twist or sub-something that I missed (blaming myself instead of the filmmaker!). This movie is quite slow until about the last half-hour. It then puts the pedal to the metal with the creep factor and disturbing torture scenes. The schizoid mother was something else; I don't recall her ever saying she loved her children.

I didn't feel anything for them or her. And then the last third of the movie is just cruelty without any emotion or tension behind it -- I just wanted it over.
The twist wasn't even necessarily, btw. It would just be interesting enough to wonder along with the children whether this is really their mom.
Also, if you ever saw the 70's movie The Other as a kiddo you will feel this is a very pretty but not scary rip-off of it.

7434996,4,B015EVT7FI,I wanted to see this at my local art theater and I didn't get the chance.  I was so happy to see this available to watch free on Amazon Prime so quickly.  This is a foreign language film but don't let that stop you from seeing this as there is very little dialog and the subtitles are easy to read.  The overall vibe I got was very dark and looming with a few disturbing scenes. I was interested to find out where the story was going until the very end. I think this is a must see for any horror or independent movie fan.,1454198400,,521,3.9903846153846154

7435001,1,B015EVT7FI,"As others have mentioned, this (in typical industry fashion) is a complete ripoff of a movie made back in the 70s called The Other. And that movie was, much, much beter.

Do yourself a favor and get that movie. This is a cheap, unimaginative imitation of what is a really good original movie (back whenever people still made original films.) Those days are long behind us, I suppose. But fortunately for us, the great ones are still available for the most part.

What a shame...wasting time and money to knockoff what should be a very well respected movie.

No spoilers, just a genuine warning to skip this, watch the original (The Other) and enjoy that as a genuinely well made thriller/horror movie. Wish I would've read the reviews before wasting my time on this. I own the original on DVD, I could've just put that on and enjoyed it 100 times more.",1454198400,,852,4.592105263157895

7435007,2,B015EVT7FI,"Quite honestly, if you don't guess the twist within the first 5-10 minutes, then you obviously don't watch alot of movies... I had high hopes for this film, but then again, I got sucked in by the interesting and eerie trailer. My mistake. Also, make no mistake- this is in no way a horror film, or a thriller for that matter. I don't quite know how to categorize this but it was the least frightening film I've ever seen, and I've watched plenty of similar films. There are dozens of red herrings throughout the film, and even when the not-so-surprising twist is revealed, we still don't get much explanation. There are still a few questions I have but don't really feel like putting in the effort to research them. I can easily compare the premise to a few other films, but that would spoil the entire movie. There are PLENTY of clues that left me blinking in disbelief, and the only reason I actually finished watching is because I was curious if anything else would come of it. Sadly, not. The acting by the twins is quite good and the scenery is lovely, but that's about all I found intriguing.

The movie is subtitled, but very easy to follow (given that not much of anything happens). Also, don't go by anything you see in the trailer. It's all extremely misleading. I'm still disappointed that I wasted my time and that it wasn't anything like I imagined it would be. It's no fun watching something when you already have everything figured out.",1454112000,,1451,4.559386973180077

So, in essence, you have a film built around a transparent twist dressed up in quiet indie gloom. And it's slow and subtitled. Not impressed.  Now I will say that it is a beautifully shot film, is edited well, and delivers on the creepy atmosphere ... but you get all of that in the trailer.

I don't want to give away anything. But the cinematic atmosphere of it all drives it and makes for a pleasant visual experience.

7435174,5,B015EVT7FI,"If you like the build-up of a creeping air of menace, and you like having to really pay attention and think in order to understand what's going on, you will enjoy this movie. Many one-star commenters say that the ""twist"" is obvious from the start, but if you pay careful attention, it is most certainly not obvious what the truth is until the denouement, because the directors drop in clues that make you question your first and even second assumptions (""You should apologize"" is one early example). It is a lot more fun to watch if you're vigilant for clues and questioning your assumptions as you go along for the ride. After the movie was over, I had to go back and watch it again. Re-watching it gave me a new appreciation for how cleverly the filmmakers told the story, because that's when I was able to fully dissect all of the clues. On the second watch, almost every exchange, glance and action had a new meaning.

The slow pace of this movie was perfect for creating the atmosphere of tension and menace, but not so slow as to feel like a waste of time, especially since my mind was racing with trying to figure out what was really going on -- who might be right, who might be crazy, or are they all wrong?

If you like to watch torture porn, jump shots, or movies that are straightforward stories, this isn't the movie for you. There were some bits at the end that I had to watch through my fingers, and some people have called this a ""torture porn"" because of that, but I think they don't understand what a ""torture porn"" is. The brief amounts of gore in this movie were used to further the plot along, whereas, in a torture porn, the brief amounts of story are used to further the gore along.",1453593600,,1704,4.389240506329114

For me - it was one of those movies that after the last scene - it kept me asking questions and wondering about specific scenes within the movie. By now - if you've read the reviews - you get the main part of the story. But how it's told is what grabs you. And is she their mother or isn't she. And are the two boys truly what they appear to be. And what I really loved is you didn't know where it was going to go. Some things you could figure out early on, or at least have a suspicion. But for the most part - you just need to let it take you where it goes. And the climax is a whopper. Actually the last 30 minutes or so are tense and still leave you asking ""what's next???!!"". And while the ending may be a bit unclear - I loved it because it kept you thinking and wondering. It doesn't spell everything out and lets you, as the viewer, try to figure it out.

I can't really comment on why because I don't want to spoil the film for someone else, but the film still is suspenseful in the sense that I was hoping maybe my initial assumptions were wrong.  It's a nicely crafted, directed and acted piece, with the sort of claustrophobic vibe reliant on multiple hints via symbolism that one would expect in a dream-state.  I also did not find this to be really a horror film at all, even considering a few scenes are dark.  Actually it is surprising how unterrifying the dark scenes are, which is an interesting aspect of the film in itself, and relevant to the overall theme.

Hard to tell. The mom is separated from the dad and the other twin is dead clearly.

It's got an air of claustrophobia as well that just hits the mark of (please put a plastic bag over my head now.)

7435271,5,B015EVT7FI,"An Austrian film which features three actors, Susanne Wuest as the mama, and Lukas and Elias as her twin sons. The film has a hallucinatory, almost surreal mood from the start. It opens with the Trapp Family Singers performing a lullaby. Then, dissolves into a long shot of the twins playing in a corn film. Finally, the mama comes home from the hospital. As we first see her, her facial bandages appear like a skull. When it's discovered she's a TV personality in Vienna, it's assumed she's had reconstructive surgery. But has she? She's not acting right. The mama refuses to feed one of the twins, even refuses to talk to him. And the twins, aren't exactly normal kids. They raise giant Brazilian cockroaches, which they dream about feeding to their mother, whom they later split open to reveal, a belly filled with giant cockroaches. Another dream has the mother walking naked into the woods, and turning into a tortured demon. Meanwhile, in the waking nightmare of their lives, the boys discover an ancient ossuary, in a dark cave. The kids have no problem climbing all over the bones, to rescue a sick cat, which they bring home. The cat dies. Did the mama do this? At this point, you're not even half way into this twisted film. The cat gets preserved in the cockroach terrarium on the coffee table, floating in gasoline. The mama gets a little balmy, and as punishment, locks the kids into their bedroom. The games become more and more twisted. When the grand finale hits, I was amazed. No, I didn't see it coming. Yes, it shocked me. I loved the film. For all it's bizarre, macabre imagery, the brain numbing combination of innocence, and dementia, the surreal imagery nestled in a rural home set in a beautiful countryside. I could see Lynch directing a film like this.",1453507200,,1778,4.68370607028754

Then their mother comes home, her face bandaged from reconstructive surgery. (The reason reconstruction was needed, you may well ask.) Mom seems in a foul mood, but there's more than that- she doesn't seem to know her children anymore. Is it because of the surgery? Or was this minor celebrity tv mom always too wrapped up in herself to know her boys the way they know each other?

There are shades of Tryon's ""The Other,"" and you'll probably guess the ending, but still it's a creepy little tale.",1453420800,,626,4.6909090909090905

7435283,4,B015EVT7FI,"My girlfriend and I had seen the previous for this film on facebook.  Once I realized that it was an independent film and it was Polish one at that, i knew it was going to be a slow film.  And that's exactly what it was, slow, but a good kind of slow.  It builds up wonderfully and creeps you out as it does so.  The film uses the art of silence as a tool, to keep you on your toes, wondering if something is going to pop up around the corner.  I felt a sense of dread and was uncomfortable the whole time watching this movie, which is good, the film did it's job.  My girlfriend pointed out the twist of the film right from the very start, which now that i think about it, was pretty obvious.  Which is the only thing I could say was bad about this movie, I wish they would have hidden the films' secret a little better.
""Goodnight Mommy"" isn't for everyone.  If you're the type of person who likes blockbusters that get right to the point and are made by traditional
Hollywood standards, then look elsewhere.  If you like independent films, which are made with their own artistic flare, not looking to please the masses, then by all means, sit down and enjoy this treat.",1453334400,,1172,4.243243243243243

7435289,2,B015EVT7FI,"I am so sick of movies releasing trailers which make them out to be something they are not. This is not a horror movie. It really is more of a drama. If they had been upfront about what it was, I would have given it a slightly higher rating. That said, the movie is also predictable. I knew basically what was going on in the first 10 minutes or so after the kid asked why the mom didn't give Lukas a drink and the mom replied, ""you know why."" They are trying to pull a Sixth Sense type of surprise ending but it doesn't work. Why? The movie invites you to figure out what is going on from the very beginning. Sixth Sense didn't do that. So, rather than giving you any surprise reward for watching it until the end, it just plays out as you would expect if you are an intelligent, savvy viewer. They would have been much better off not trying to pull the surprise ending trick and instead releasing it as the psychological drama it is, with a bit of a more upfront opening.",1453248000,6,973,4.180851063829787

This Austrian film would seem to have fit the bill.  It has been well-reviewed.  Hell, it even won several film awards in Europe.  So why didn't it ring my bell?

There are essentially only 3 actors in the film.  Lukas and Elias Schwarz are twins who play Lukas and Elias in the film.  Their mother, is played by Susanne Wuest (Murder Sisters).  Mom has just gotten home from the hospital where she had cosmetic facial surgery.  The 10 year old brothers are best friends as you might expect.  But something is amiss.  Pay attention and youll figure it out pretty quickly.  Is this really mom behind all those bandages?  She seems crankier than usual.  The boys aren't so sure.  So they start to interrogate her, taking it to extremes.  Each insistence by mom that she is who she says she is, seems to put her in more jeopardy.

In the early going, the story moves very slowly and when it starts to get fun, mom becomes very stupid.  Then there are the 2 volunteers from the Red Cross who show up at the rural house and just walk in when no one answers the door.  Try that in Texas.  Some of the dreams one of the boys has regularly didn't make much sense to me either.  M. Night Shyamalan would love this film.  Maybe I was just too tired.",1453075200,,1401,4.390625

I thought this film would be a more intellectual approach to horror than most films of the genre and to some degree it is. Or, at least, it starts off that way. And I enjoyed the 1 or 2 sudden frights in the first half of the film. But, the second half reduced it to such a disturbing level that I decided it would be better for my mental health to just stop watching. I know that will turn some people on and of course, it's just a movie. But movies are depictions of other peoples ideas and while most are beneficial in some form or another, this film takes things to an unnecessarily traumatizing level, making it, IMO, completely unhealthy. So if like me, you are attempting to keep your psyche as healthy as possible in this chaotic world, simply avoid this film. The 2 thrills and chills you see in the trailer are not worth it.

It seems to indicate that she is some sort of ghost or supernatural creature, but in the rest of the movie, she seems completely human.  2) How did she remain asleep when a giant cockroach climbed into her mouth? I don't care how many sleeping pills she took, unless she took an overdose, she would have awakened when that thing started down her esophagus. Also, who killed the cat? That is never clear, although the mother did tell the boys not to bring animals in the house. Which begs the question: If she really was their mother, and it appears that she was, why did she change so much? Apparently she loved animals before. And why didn't she know her son's favorite song? Why was she so harsh and uncaring? If she was grieving, it is understandable that she might change, especially since (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER) she lost one of her sons and the other one refused to accept his death. And where was the father? She mentions a ""separation"" but it is not clear whether she meant she was separated from her husband, or the twins were separated from each other by the death of one of them.

If you don't watch a lot of horror movies you might like it more than I did; unfortunately, I thought it was predictable from the mom's first interaction with the boys. I really hoped I was wrong and there would be more to the story, but unfortunately that was about it. I'm not a fan of torture movies though, so if you're into that I guess you might like it. Also, what was with the mom walking through the woods with the weird face thing? Symbolism of the mother's physical and mental transformation or an attempt to throw the viewer off track? Either way it was very out of place from the rest of the movie. The same with the woman in the photo, the mom's ""friend"".... or twin maybe? And the cave of bones.

What a thoroughly unpleasant experience.

This ""twist"" ending has become a familiar and annoying cliche, especially among horror films, and film-makers just need to give it a rest.  Moreover, as a practicing ED  physician with years' of clinical experience, and someone who manages patients with mental illness every day, I can emphatically state that the particular form of psychosis depicted in this film---an elaborately complex delusion with paranoid features so severe it leads to grotesque torture and matricide---is so rare the co-writers/directors might have just as well made a film about Bigfoot or an UFO abduction....at least those have some plausible connection to reality.

7435392,5,B015EVT7FI,"* spoilers *

There's something wrong with the mother. Her face is covered by bandages as the result of cosmetic facial surgery and even through the bandages bruising is quite obvious. She seems to be completely different from before the surgery: more severe and less prone to laugh or sing like she used to. She puts strict rules on her twin boys Elias and Lukas to allow for her to rest and recuperate including complete silence in the house, blinds always drawn, and playing only outside. It's curious from the beginning that she completely ignores Lukas: doesn't serve him food or drink, doesn't accept presents from him, doesn't listen to what he says, and only interacts with Elias. When possible, she avoids the children altogether, even pretending to be asleep when they try to wake her. Could she be someone masquerading as their mother?

Good Night Mommy centers around the mystery of the mother. The children think there's something wrong with her or she's a completely different person than she says she is. They do usual childish antics like being loud, bringing in cats from outside, and generally being kind of a nuisance. When caught, their mother becomes cruel and acts violently towards them. Then they discover pictures removed from the house, prompting them to investigate their mother further. Things escalate further when the cat they brought in the house is found dead in the basement. Elias and Lukas leave it for their mother to find in a terrarium and she flies into a fury, demanding Elias to repeat the she is his mother and to never talk to Lukas again. The boys are locked up in the house until the mother turns sweet and offers them a present. The first opportunity they get, they run away to a church to try to find help, but they are returned to their home.

At this point, I am completely sympathetic to the boys. Their mother's mercurial moods are unpredictable. The abuse she doles out is cruel and extreme considering the offending acts. Elias and Lukas are far from perfect, but they don't deserve to be treated terribly for acting like children. The whole situation is undeniably suspicious and it's understandable for the boys to looks for answers. The film is brilliantly constructed and filmed to build up uneasiness through a lot of pointed silences and uncomfortable scenes. Beyond the mother's abuse and the cat's death, nothing is really wrong, but something is definitely off in the house. Small things like the out of focus framed pictures, the mom's all white bedroom and dress, and the way the characters sometimes just stand and stare for uncomfortable stretches heighten the off kilter feeling. The amorphous and haunting soundtrack also adds to the uncomfortable atmosphere. The last third of the film throws everything we've believed into question.

When the mother wakes up, the boys have tied her up and literally torture her in a variety of ways including burning her face with magnifying glasses and supergluing her mouth shut to try to find out where their mom is. These scenes are incredibly uncomfortable both from the nature and length of the scene. My sympathy shifts from the sons to the mother even if she is an imposter. No matter what she's done, she doesn't deserve to be callously tortured. The mother finally concedes to allow Elias to speak with his brother because Lukas was killed in an accident. This was far from the conclusion I expected, but it makes sense. Elias already proved his capacity for cruelty with burning the bugs outside and presumably killing the cat himself off screen. Lukas always encourages him to be more extreme and callous because he is a hallucinated aspect of Elias' own psyche that can't process his twin's death. He reacts with violence possibly because his mother does so on a smaller scale. The film ends with Elias setting the house on fire after he challenges the mother to see his hallucinated brother and she fails.

This brings me to the mother. I completely understand her after the last revelation of the film. She is processing her own grief while trying to raise her son and help him process his. Not only did her son die, but her husband also left her. She can't afford to keep the large house anymore and has to adjust to a great many new things in addition to her grief and her remaining son's grief. It must be painful for her to see and spend time with Elias since he looks exactly like Lukas, so she hides from him and doesn't quite know how to treat him when he misbehaves. The bandages symbolizes her own pain and grief. It keeps her from relating to her son and she needs time away from him to process, causing her to neglect her son's needs. Since Elias killed the cat, her reaction to that makes so much more sense. He murdered a cat and left if for her to find while denying she is his mother and talking to his dead sibling. While her abuse is still horrible, she's obviously overwhelmed and simply doesn't know how else to help her son with no other support. Her solution is to force him to repeat true things, but it simply doesn't force him to believe them. When she returns all smiles and presents, it's clear that she realizes how monstrous her actions were and she wants to make amends without actually admitting her faults. The mother is human and wants the best for her son. Like anyone else, she needed to process her own emotions and she made a mistakes along the way.

Goodnight Mommy is slow burn film with incredibly uncomfortable scenes. The tragic ending shows how toxic denial and ignoring grief can be. Lukas and Elias Schwarz are amazing actors. They can elicit sympathy from the audience one moment as innocent children and then turn psychotic the next. Susanne Wuest is also formidable as the mother and brings depth to her role. It would have been easy to make the mother a flat character especially since her face is hidden for more than half the film, but Wuest makes the role memorable and keeps the audience guessing. I highly recommend Goodnight Mommy and I would recommend it to those who liked The Babadook as it shares theme and circumstances.",1452384000,14,6098,4.72112676056338

I just didn't understand why so many scenes were in the movie.  I know there were dream sequences but why the red cross people-I've never had someone walk in my house and start looking for me for a donation(and don't know anyone on the planet who has), the freezer delivery guy walks in and starts filling up the freezer, the cat, the bones the cat's walking on when they find it, the cockroaches were pets?

If you want to compare this movie to any it would be The Other from the 70's but I love The Other..Not this movie. Save Your Money!!!!,1452297600,3,430,4.011627906976744
7435396,2,B015EVT7FI,"I can understand the positive ratings but I found this movie to be somewhat boring.  This movie is strikingly similar to a classic (though relatively unknown) movie called The Other made in 1972.  It was apparent (at least to me) in the first five minutes the plot device that they were using as their ""twist"".  About half way through the movie I fast forwarded because the plot device had eventually worn thin and it was now just a question of how it would all play out.  The violent ending wasn't a surprise, it was just a question of what it would be.  The ironic thing is, if you watch the movie and remove the plot device, it could still be as effective, if not more so, as a taut psychological thriller. Additionally, the trailer is really deceiving and implies some type of otherworldly or supernatural aspect when it's really just a movie about a decent into madness.  Watch The Other instead...",1452211200,,903,4.577639751552795

The twist was obvious, and the viewer was lead to it the whole movie. So why not blow our minds by making it something different then just the obvious. If you didn't figure it out before the end, you were probably drunk, high, or just not really paying attention.",1452124800,2,546,4.47
7435399,3,B015EVT7FI,"Creepy as can be, but too slow paced to be as effective as it could have been.  So often with ""horror"" movies, the story will bear a very taut, tense 60 minutes...but it gets stretched to 85 or 90 to find a market (not a lot of places screening 60 minute movies).  That is absolutely the case with this cold-as-ice creepy-fest.

Watching GOODNIGHT MOMMY, I also felt ""only in Europe.""  Or at least, ""not in the States.""  Our movies would never let children be quite so blithely brutal.  It's the story of twin boys (aged maybe 11-13?) who are home alone at their gorgeous home in the country (Austria, it would seem).  They play in the fields, explore caves, etc.  Then one day, their mother comes home from the hospital.  Her face is almost completely bandaged and the parts of her that do show are bruised and even bloody.  The twins are instantly convinced that this woman is NOT their mother.  At first, we just get to share their ""detective work"" on this woman, and begin to see things from their side.  But they want to be convinced, and the things they begin to do to this woman in the name of getting to the truth are quite unsettling.

But this is not the whole story.  I won't spoil anything for you if I can, but rest assured that this ""is she or isn't she"" theme is far from all this film is exploring.  You may not find everything that is revealed to be surprising, but the journey is still deeply unsettling.  At times, the movie shows us almost nothing...we are left to imagine.  And then at other times, it is startlingly graphic.  So be prepared.  It's mostly a quiet film (and disquieting), but not always ""polite.""

But there are too many scenes of the twins simply looking at each other, as if silently deliberating.  True, we've all heard that twins have their own special empathy (telepathy?), but that doesn't mean it makes for interesting viewing.  And a few too many shots are repeated over and over.  We see the twins hunkered down over ""mom"", wearing their white strap t-shirts (as seen on the cover photo) simply way too many times.

Some scenes are unusual and effective, such as the creepy game of ""20 questions"" the boys play with their mom.  Others, like when the Red Cross volunteers stop by and are astonishingly pushy, strain credibility a bit too much.

The film has an overall quite dark and oppressive mood.  With the slow pace and general gray feeling, this is bit of a chore to get through.  I watched with two other folks.  All of us fans of creepy movies.  One feel asleep just past mid-way.  The other (and I) dosed briefly from time to time...but didn't seem to lose anything important.  It simply needed to be tightened and shortened.  I still recommend it if the basic plot sounds appealing or interesting.  I did not consider it a waste of time at all.  But if quiet, creepy films aren't your cup of tea...this will not suddenly change your mind.  (Oh, and based on a couple of 1-star reviews here...yes, the film is in German with English subtitles.  Sorry, you will actually have to read a bit!  Most of us don't mind, but for those viewers who struggle to multi-task, be warned.)",1452124800,,3129,4.5115864527629235

 ""Goodnight Mommy"" is the essence of minimalist abandon, both visually and psychologically. Who are these people in the middle of nowhere brandishing inner pain and tragedy and drama with utter abandon.

The viewer is given one dot of information at the beginning. There are twin brothers, but one is dead, while the living one lives as if both live. That is the beginning of the game, but as the mother says a couple of times, I'll play the game this time. However, is this an imaginary game or one with a hidden agenda? Or, is this a supernatural game played in a different dimension? Clues and visual references placed strategically suggest these various modes of game play.

The power of this film is its ability to draw the viewer into its spin, then perambulate along the edges then up into the vortex. That's how I felt, watching this slow motion-story open its aperture minimally until the pace reaches a crescendo in the mother's bedroom when that aperture is wide open. The viewer is hooked previously, now, there is no leaving, no abandoning this sudden 200l Space Odyssey strangeness.

The crux of the story, or along its major story line, Is that a savage sense of justice prevails--but at what cost?-- and the right thing triumphs-only if you are inside the story. But who's to say what is the right thing in this  story? It's Lord of the Flies in a modern setting with only two savages, or one savage, or maybe none going amuck.

In our country, the USA, most likely a counselor or psychologist would have been routinely checking in on this unfortunate family.

7435417,4,B015EVT7FI,"Nine Things About the Film ""Goodnight Mommy""

1.  It's hard to adequately describe what this movie is. Technically, it's a horror movie. But a quiet one. Quiet and cruel.

2. It's got a creepy beginning - two twin brothers greet their mother, who has just gotten home from the hospital. She had facial surgery, and her head is completely wrapped up. Immediately, she begins acting differently from how she was before the surgery. She becomes more bizarre and abusive, and the boys suspect that the woman they live with isn't really their mother.

3. It's impossible to predict where the movie is going, because all three characters lose the ability to act or think rationally, so you have no consistent thread to hold onto.

4. Writer/directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala really know how to tell this story, dangling clues in front of you while making you more tense and confused.

5. This is not an exciting, scream-filled movie of blood and body counts. There really isn't even anything to make you jump. This is a slow, insidious horror that builds up inside you until you want to turn your head away, but you can't.

6. If you are bothered by depictions of families that are, um, mean to each other. then you can move along and watch something else.

7. Most of the movie takes place in one house with the three characters. All three actors have a twisted charisma that is used to full effect.

8. This is one of those movies that you need to watch twice, because when it's over, you realize that you missed more clues than you thought.

9. This movie won't be to everybody's liking. But it's going to haunt me more than any other film I've seen this year.",1451520000,165,1666,4.579124579124579

This movie might be a remake of another film that came out long before even that one, I don't know, but the premises for both are essentially the same.  The difference being,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Uninvited/dp/B0026OFZZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Uninvited</a>, did a much, MUCH better job of masking the fact that the other sibling was dead.  This movie pretty much spills the beans every chance it can get.  I know a lot of people make claims, but I knew what was going on VERY early on in the film and that didn't make things any better.  It forced me to sit through a movie waiting for the inevitable.  Also, this movie was left with HUGE holes that would essentially effect the actual story if they weren't masking the fact that one kid was actually alone.

All in all, I was extremely disappointed as I'd (for the most part) seen this movie before and done way better.  The only reason this movie gets two stars instead of one is I thought the two boys (Lukas and Elias Schwarz) did a really good job.  Actually, their performance was probably the only reason I was able to finish the movie.

7435433,3,B015EVT7FI,"A mother returns home to her 10-year-old identical twin sons with her face covered in bandages. But as she recovers, her increasingly odd behavior fuels the boys' fears that the woman behind the gauze may not be their mother. To say much would give away the plot. The twist ending I did not personally see coming. Many reviewers were questioning the mothers behavior: Is she an imposter, or someone who endured a separation and a terrible accident, who happens to be suffering from intense guilt and emotional pain. For me, this one was obvious.

Many reviewers also had issues understanding the scene where the mother walks into the woods, taking her clothes off and shaking her head violently back and forth. That's an easy one folks: this was a dream the boys were having as they started to truly believe this was not their mother, but someone or something else. Take note that immediately after that scene, the camera cuts to the boys being jolted awake. There was another gross dream sequence involving the boy's pet roaches as well.

The ending can be interpreted in different ways, but to give my interpretation would add spoilers.

Slow moving, tense and well acted. Not really a horror film, but a psychological mystery that may move slowly but keeps you interested. More like an art house type film that switches gear near the end with scenes of toture which I'm not a big fan of.

This is German with English subtitles. Any foreign film will have subtitles so if you hate to read, you might want to pass, but it's an easy film to follow since the dialog isn't fast and furious.",1450742400,,1588,4.681003584229391

7435436,4,B015EVT7FI,"The film holds value as an aesthetic wonder. It is visually stunning, morally disturbing and strangely provocative. It plays wonderfully with the spectator's perceptions, threatening their assumptions and shaking their schematic foundations. The first half of the film comprises the view of the child; the second increasingly projects the perspective of the mother as their roles begin to reverse and the child-victim becomes the child-aggressor. However, the story has some surprising gaps that are never adequately addressed by the filmmakers. While it becomes clear later in the film that the first half is the child's perspective, it is difficult to understand why we the audience are seeing the mother alone and behaving so strangely. Yes, we come to realize later on that it is because that is what her child is imagining and not reality; however, there are more than one instance of the mother acting aggressive and odd both toward her child and alone, such that the switch into victim mode seems unbelievable.

It is just as untenable that a plot about a severely disturbed child would not include a convalescent mother with such obvious material means as shown in the film with a helper of some kind, if not to show how the immaculate, posh home is being cared for so nicely on the surface, then at least an assistant to help with the evidently traumatized child who is revealed to us as a psychopath.

Films which do the same in terms of psycho-horror involving severe threats to the middle-class or upper class family such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Games/dp/6305228876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Games</a>&nbsp;or others which this film appears to emulate in its striving to depict the nuclear-family unit or parent-child dyad under siege, and the cruel social disintegration of communities accomplish their goals by setting up a logical chain of cause and effect within the bizarre yet poignantly truthful social worlds they have chosen.

Goodnight Mommy doesn't do that quite as well. And, at some points the violence and torture becomes nearly gratuitous, or if not gratuitous then working to reinforce the trope of the evil child toward whom the audience becomes fearful. Ultimately, Goodnight Mommy plays not only upon the audience's expectations but undermines the modern mythic construct of the innocent child,  mythic in terms of its value as that which a society believes about itself more than something that is somehow fabricated outside social and historical contexts. Goodnight Mommy tears the mythic fabric asunder without offering a context of its own that might aid in contesting the destructive dynamic it presents. What is clear is that the mother-child, specifically mother-son, duo is in shocking disarray, as part of an isolated fragment of a society that doesn't come to the rescue of the little family, like the cold and reluctantly helping priest and Red Cross workers who have no clue as to what is really happening between the mother and child. The screenplay is such that although they are provided a few clues that all is not right, they blithely leave the disturbed home without intervening.

As part of the film's utter coldness, it exudes no humor, an oversight which, whether intended or not, differentiates itself from the most effective horror and psycho-thrillers such as<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Flies-Essential-Art-House/dp/B001BEK8EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shining/dp/B000GWE44U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shining</a>&nbsp;and many of Hitchcock's films. Humor, part of the rich repertoire of human emotions that provides respite, however brief, from the genuine horrors in the lives of characters subjected to the varied torments their creators have chosen, saves us not from the truth - for better or worse no representation can ever quite access it for all people in all times - but rather allows us to wander into a greater truth without submerging our humanity along with it.",1450656000,2,4320,5.85079365079365

A younger audience who may have missed watching classic horror films with twists or never watched the Hitchcock series might rave over this film and wonder why everyone doesn't think it's great.

Austrians must not be familiar with the time-honored tradition of evil twins in horror stories, because a good bit of the tension this tries to build hinges on your not figuring out a ""twist"" that you'll likely figure out in the first five minutes. Then there's a good deal of repetition and treading water until it gets to the climax -- which, since you already figured out that twist way back at the beginning, is kind of the definition of anticlimactic. Some plot points are left hanging, and there's a general vagueness and murkiness to the way the story is told that builds some tension at first, then gets sort of annoying. On the upside the kid actors are good, and that creepy atmosphere is well sustained. So, with a better script, these filmmakers might yet make a really good horror movie.

7435452,3,B015EVT7FI,"The tone of this film is one of dread and hypnosis.  By hypnosis I mean you can fall asleep to the sound design in this film.  And if you're def, you can find yourself comforted by the shimmery gloss of the set design.  It's a very well done film.  I don't know if there's a difference between a ""major"" film and a ""indie"" film in Austria and/or Germany, but a lot of US indie films are just amateurish, like someone had a so-so script and couldn't get Hollywood to hire a 2nd writer to improve upon it so they took it upon themselves to buy a crappy camera and a 3rd rate film crew and get to work, since, ya know, their ""art"" is so important...Anyway, this film is superior to many ""major"" motion pictures of today in the technical sense, but the script is just lacking.  Other reviewers complained about a ""twist"" or something, and I honestly don't care what the twist is or if there was one.  The only thing I could get out of this movie was a sense that the children were living in an abusive home.  Weather or not their abuse was legally defined as such I think would depend on weather or not the kids' seemingly genuine belief that their mother was gone and had been replaced by an imposter was the truth.  They did not feel safe in their home.  A change of venue, at least in the U.S., could indeed be granted on those grounds alone.  Every other facet of the film's script was a bunch of teasing.  Lots of small scenes that had absolutely no significance.  A scene with the presumed anti-Mom standing in front of her mirror with the fan blowing and another scene where she was pretending to be asleep when one of the kids walked into her room after they knocked on the door and failed to get a response.  The reason the kid knocked on the door in the first place was b/c the Schwan's guy came by with a boatload of frozen pizza.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume the woman/Mom pretending to be asleep had something to do with the story, and it may have, but you'd have to ask the screenwriter what the value in that scene is.  Although I don't know if he'd be able to tell you.  He'd probably be like ""Isn't it obvious?""  It isn't to me.  This film is probably geared to a more studious crowd.  Maybe seniors in high school and college sophomores might enjoy this film a bit more.  I remember watching Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965) during my high school years and finding it worth my time.  I don't remember anything about it tho and I wasn't blown away by it, I just remember I didn't turn it off midway through like I did this and many other films nowadays.",1449964800,5,2585,4.26694045174538

As at least one other reviewer noted, the ""twist"" is very easy to figure out (I knew what it was less than half way through the film) and once you understand what's going on, the pace and dialogue are futile and painfully slow. Although the two boys who star in the movie are good in their roles, that is not enough to rescue this movie.

7435461,5,B015EVT7FI,"it's difficult to review this because my main feeling is ""now this is MY kind of scary movie"". everything works. setting. story. script. pace. twists. the MAJOR twist. the fears the story taps into. and, for those thinking this might be too tame gore/violence-wise, there are 3 or 4 moments when things go nightmarishly horrifying. (and very much from the point-of-view of a young person) one in particular was excruciating. However, I felt everything served the plot and shocks and jumps were structured well into a satisfying viewing experience. the mood is fantastic. the near-total lack of music SO works b/c when music does enter it's for a very specific and emotional reason tied to the story. Even the one or two fleeting seconds where the limits of the special effects are evident end up working because they represent a dream-logic point of view. I love how ""old school"" this is in choosing a few specific and effective visual touches so they are most effective and stand out b/c it isn't a constant barrage of ""weird stuff"". the bandages and the masks in particular are SO effective. And nearly everything falls into place for a second viewing once the major twist is revealed. my only complaints are about something quite understandable- I was annoyed with the English language title ""Goodnight Mommy"" because throughout the film the boys call her ""momma/mama"". However, perhaps the timing of the release of this was close enough to the Spanish genre film ""Mama"" where the intent was to avoid confusion with that film? Also, I've seen some unfortunate criticisms of this film because of one element it shares with the somewhat recent genre film ""The Skin I Live In"". Both feature a woman with bandages over her face. That's all. They're completely different stories. Lastly, I truly appreciated the interview with the filmmakers because I loved what they each had to say about childhood experiences which inspired aspects of the story. Very cool.

I thought it was brilliant to have the trailer make the mother look like the crazy villain when there actually isn't a villain. The lack of dialogue and the way that it's shot is mesmerizing and really pulls you in. Also, because of things that I've had to deal with as a child, I've always enjoyed films that depict children stepping up and fighting back against adults.

Then why all the negative reviews? Chalk it up to typical American ignorance. Can't be bothered to read the description, too lazy to read subtitles, too spoiled by Hollywood trash to pay attention and appreciate film as an art and an immersive experience instead of just something to half-pay attention to when you're bored and drunk.

People complain about it not being scary. Well, what is? Movies are never scary because they are just that: MOVIES. You know it's not real. I'd much-rather watch something unsettling and disturbing that could actually happen. Stuff that makes you think. God f*cking forbid someone makes a good film with no awful CGI, no fake jump scares, no inconsistent story and no unexplained ending just for the sake of leaving it open for a crappy sequel.

What a shame! What a supreme letdown! I thought ""Finally! This is it!! The suspense/horror masterpiece I've been waiting for!"" Now why on earth would I think that? Well for the same reason I thought that about other films that seemed promising but turned out to be just alright or even downright terrible. This one falls more in the ""just alright"" category. The reasons are simple I thought this was going to be better. Once again for the umpteenth time -so called ""honest/expert reviews"". Now first let me say(and I know a good deal about this and because I have done a great deal of research on this), it's a different ball game my friends. It's a jungle out there. Amateur and professional reviewers are often being paid for a positive review. The evidence is overwhelming, all you have to do is research this. It's a fact. It is powerful weapon in the marketing arena and it is working. Millions plop down their money to purchase or rent movies based on rave reviews. Many people right on amazon admit they take a financial or special deal reward from whom might be on the other end to write a rave review on films that might not deserve the praise. I've mentioned this problem in other reviews. And it's not just a problem, it's getting out of control.

So in a nutshell? We can no longer trust reviews to be honest ones. That's a fact. So the best thing to do is start with the negative reviews and work our way the opposite direction. In my case where this movie is concerned I didn't keep to this rule and went straight to VUDU and read all the expert reviews. Folks, they lie right through their teeth. I'm telling ya'. They made this sound like the new modern masterpiece everyone has been waiting for. ""Suspense that grabs you by the jugular and never let's go!"" ""It will keep you in fear, clenching the person next to you till the last terrifying moments!"". This is just plain not even close to true. It's a bald face lie!

So is this is bad movie? No it's actually not that bad, but it isn't all that good either. But for one there isn't much horror. It isn't much of a horror movie at all. That's ok. But there isn't much in the way of suspense either. Maybe subtle suspense here and there. In fact not much happens through the entire duration of this movie. Kids start wondering if the woman in their house is their mother. She locks them in their room, treats them coldly, sleeps a lot. They suspect something isn't right, and believe she might not be their mother. They plant a baby monitor in her room and listen to it. They don't hear much. Slight grunting, her possibly sexually satisfying her self, and that's about it. For the most part the kinder run and play outside, tinker on a piano, spy on their mom, who doesn't do much of anything except for a moment walks into the woods, strips naked and all the sudden begins to wiggle her head very fast, giving the impression she's some kind of monster or demon or alien or something. But nothing comes of it and she appears by the end of the film to be a regular person, so that scene makes zero sense. Another thing that really annoyed me is a scene where the Red Cross knocks on their door looking for a donation. They knock twice then decide to let themselves in when they think no one is home. I'm sorry but they don't do this in Germany any more different than they do most anywhere. That was just plain dumb.

But what do you benefit from seeing this film? Well you get to see a nice house with wonderful decorum, lovely rain, a forest, a woman with bandages on her face. Two kids sitting or walking around and either hitting each other, burping at each other, spying on their mother, or looking for a missing cat. You get to see a woman fastened to a bed, prodded and gagged and then mildly tortured. You get to see her have her lips welded together with super glue. That's exciting I suppose. And if you wait long enough, till the last 10 minutes you get a reward and find out something you didn't know. Then when you find that out you think ""Oh at least there is a surprise, but the same surprise I think I've seen several times before"". And finally a little shock comes almost at the very end. Other than that, in a word ""YAWN!""

I love German and French art house, and I love slow suspenseful films, but this is kind of art house without much art, not much acting, not much suspense, not much of anything.  The house looked cool, nice scenery, basic acting that was bland but ok, and a slight mood of suspense. Other than that there simply is nothing here worth seeing",1449100800,9,4615,4.379229871645274

7435502,5,B015EVT7FI,"Goodnight Mommy is a hair-raising thriller about nine-year-old identical twins Lukas and Elias, who live in an isolated home deep in the Austrian countryside. As the film opens, they are awaiting the return of their mother from the hospital. When she comes home with her face obscured by bandages, nothing is like it was before. Her behavior is strange and she seems constantly mean. Before long, the boys start to doubt whether this woman is actually who she says she is.

Directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala summon a steady sense of dread and keep the viewer guessing. Because the house is miles away from any possibility of help, the young boys must deal with their escalating horror entirely by themselves. Who would believe the claims of two nine-year-olds that their mother is not their mother? Reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers without the science fiction slant, Goodnight Mommy bases its horror on those closest to us becoming cold and distant. Its a fear children may have but adults can identify with, as well.

Making the protagonists a pair of kids heightens the tension. We tend to be more concerned for children in peril in movies than adults. The twins are not cut from the mold of typically dim horror flick characters who exist only to follow every cliche and wind up brutally slaughtered. Their suspicions mount because the behavior of the woman who calls herself their mother is so far from what they recognize. Their reactions are not contrived or neatly convenient; we see them behave and react to a situation that first puzzles, then upsets, then terrifies them. Their growing apprehension and dread occur believably.

7435508,5,B015EVT7FI,"Directed and written by Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz, Goodnight Mommy (original Austrian title Ich seh, Ich Seh) is a superbly crafted film that resets the goalposts for what mystery/horror can be.

Warning - while I am carefully avoiding any spoilers in this review, I strongly advise against reading too many reviews lest you inadvertently stumble across one that will spoil things for you.  The best way to experience this film is to go into it knowing only the barest minimum about the plot.

The film opens with two boys, a pair of 10-year-old twins named Elias and Lukas (Elias and Lukas Schwarz), playing a carefree version of hide and seek in a cornfield in rural Austria.  A car comes to their house bringing their mother (Susanne Wuest) home.  Evidently Mother has been in the hospital undergoing some kind of surgery that has left her face heavily bandaged. In addition to her strange appearance, Mother seems to be acting strangely as well - insisting on absolute quiet in the house, that the blinds be kept shut to block out the light, and treating the twins differently, favoring one while ignoring the other. The boys begin to wonder - is this really Mother?  And if not, who is she and where is their real mother?

This is _not_ your typical Hollywood mystery/horror film.  It doesn't rely on special effects or gimmicks, it doesn't leaven the building tension with absurdly comic moments, and above all it is absolutely unflinching as the mystery descends into nightmare where the stakes just keep getting raised higher and higher.  Despite the central characters being two ten-year-olds and their mother, this is _not_ a film for children.  Everything is realistically depicted and the camera _never_ looks away.  There are moments when it will genuinely creep you out.

The acting is top-notch.  Newcomers Elias and Lukas Schwarz are picture-perfect as the twins, always coming across as completely natural and unaffected, even in the scenes where you're squirming and wondering 'Are they _really_ doing that'?  They also manage to nail the distinct individual personalities the boys have, which is very important to the film.  Susanne Wuest is equally riveting as Mother, always keeping you guessing as to what's going on, alternating between seeming strange, furtive and unsympathetic to having moments of vulnerable humanity... and then suddenly leaving you wondering if those moments were just a trick.  They keep you emotionally locked in all the way through until things are suddenly thrown into sharp clarity.

But much of what makes Goodnight Mommy work is Fiala and Franz's writing and direction, both of which are superb.  The film moves slowly but deliberately, showing but never telling, and everything you see and hear matters.  The visual composition, the levels of detail, the steady ratcheting up of tension, and all of the little clues seamlessly worked in along the way are masterfully handled.  It's no surprise that this was Austria's selection as their entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category for this year's Academy Awards.

The musical score by Olga Neuwirth (Das Vaterspiel) is very subtle, never intruding on what is happening on the screen but always lurking in the background, sometimes just barely more than a sound.  And in many parts of the film there's no score at all, nothing to suggest or remind the viewer that ""It's only a movie.""  The effect is impressive and the combination adds to the mounting and unrelenting tension.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who's a fan of the suspense/thriller and mystery/horror genres.",1444953600,19,3594,5.0731292517006805
7435509,4,B015EVT7FI,"""Goodnight Mommy"" (2014 release from Austria; original title ""Ich Seh Ich Seh""; 99 min.) brings the story of 9 or 10 yr. old twin boys and their mom. As the movie opens, we see Lukas and Elias running in a cornfield and playing in the woods. When they get back home, we get to know their mom, whose face is heavily in bandages from a recent accident. The relationship between the boys and mom is strained, in particular between Lukas and mom. Soon mom announces new house rules (complete silence, not bringing in any stray animals, etc.). At this point we are maybe 10 minutes into the movie. What about the accident that caused mom's injuries? where is dad? how will the relationship between the boys and mom evolve? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, I almost missed out on this film because it is labeled a ""horror drama"" and I'm not a big fan of horror. But I finally gave in (due to the positive buzz around this film), and so glad I did. This is a 'horror' movie in the same way that ""The Shining"" was a horror movie. In reality, this is a spell-binding psychological family drama in which twin boys question whether the woman in question is really their mom, as they do not (want to) recognize her (physically--due to the accident, and emotionally--due to her meanness). At one point the boys tell her ""show us your birthmark! we want our mom back!"". The last 30 minutes of the movie will have you gasping for air... Second, it is rare that a movie has 2 directors, and rarer still that these are both woman. Indeed, this is the feature length debut of writers-directors Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz, and I must say, I am very impressed with their debut, and can't wait to see what they will do next. Third, this is a very stylish movie. It is almost entirely filmed inside of the country resort and the house is very sparse and modern, and you could argue that the house is the 4th character in the movie. Speaking of the other 3: both the boys (also named Lukas and Elias in real life), and the mother (played by Susanna Wuest) are nothing short of outstanding. This movie was the Austrian entry for the most recent Oscar for BEst Foreign Language Movie, but it did not make the final cut. That does not diminish anything about the top-notch quality of ""Ich Seh Ich Seh"" (meaning ""I See I See"", and stupidly titled ""Goodnight Mommy"" for English-language markets). No idea why it took over a year to be released in US theaters, but better late than never, as this is truly an original movie on every level.

""Ich Seh Ich Seh"" opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and as already mentioned, I hesitated to see it. So darn glad that I gave in and saw it after all. The weekday evening screening where I saw this at was attended ok (for a weekday) but not great. I'm guessing that this movie will continue to create very positive word of mouth, and has the chance to become a sleeper cult classic over time. It all reminds me a bit of the buzz that eventually grew around the Swedish 'horror' thriller ""Let The Right One In"", which eventually would be remade by Hollywood of course. Can't say that this will happen with ""Ich Seh Ich Seh, but I wouldn't be in the least surprised if it did eventually. If you are up of a top-notch foreign psychological family drama that will glue you to your seat, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Ich Seh Ich Seh"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1444780800,4,3512,4.460342146189736
7435510,5,B015EVT7FI,"I haven't seen a movie as shocking and unsettling as the German horror film Goodnight Mommy in quite a while. Its an incredibly minimalistic, yet carefully calculated experience that seems to gradually sneak up on you with its dread inducing climax. It completely flips the typical mother-son dynamic on its head, and presents a cold, bleak vision of family interaction. As dark as it may sound, I found this creative decision to be refreshing (yet also extremely unnerving).

The film opens with twin brothers - both around nine years old - who are confronted with their returning mother after shes undergone a mysterious cosmetic surgery that requires her whole face to be bandaged. The two begin to question whether or not shes truly who she says she is, sensing a new person beneath the superficialities. The audience is left to figure out what may or may not be going on, and are forced to endure the ride until then.

But like it or not, it has a frightening, dream-like quality that sucks you in and doesnt let go. The quiet relentlessness of the first hour is harshly met with the last forty minutes, which consists of some of the most intense sequences in recent memory. I found it reminiscent of Michael Hanekes original Funny Games in a lot of ways, with its unabashed violence and own magical sense of realism. And, like that film, this will not be for everyone. Its simply a break from the normal; something to challenge the viewer. This isn't your typical horror movie, but thats precisely what makes it so enthralling.",1444521600,31,1533,4.7593984962406015
7435511,2,B015EVT7FI,"Okay, so yeah, the movie has some nice shots, some eerie tension and some brief (albeit grisly) torture... It's still not that good. At all. Be advised, might have some spoilers below.

The main issue is that the movie's ""twist"" is apparent in the first literal two minutes of the film and you can easily deduce the entire reasoning for what's actually going on. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go beyond conventional storytelling, a ""Really? That's it?"" finale and one of the most poorly-written scenes in recent horror history.

I'm not against average storylines, but I wish the movie--just once--went against what I and the viewer's were anticipating, but it doesn't. Beyond the mutilation, everything is just so humdrum and typical that it's becomes boring.

One of the worst scenes is a late-game, horribly written moment of convenience that is only in here to forcefully escalate tension. It occurs when (SPOILER) two Red Cross volunteers just willfully head into the kids' home because the door was unlocked--THEY LITERALLY TRESPASS into someone's home because no one answered the doorbell. At this, they begin scouting about the home to get donations??? WHO DOES THIS? Elderly people DO NOT just enter someone's vacant home because they're looking for signatures. Nearly everyone in the theatre was baffled at this pathetically written sequence as it was ONLY in there to build tension for a certain captive. It was like watching a moment from a Z-grade slasher flick when you yell at illogical characters. Yet this wasn't Z-grade. It was high-art horror that's received accolade after accolade. In any other movie, this sort of terrible, high school writing would have been stricken down. But no, since it's foreign, it must be okay.

To break it down quicker...

- The questionable denouement breaks the fourth wall and comes off as schlock when compared to the tone of the rest of the movie.
- The trailer purposefully re-edited and misled viewers into thinking the movie was creepier (the chewy cockroach for one), deeper and better than it really was.
- Several pinnacle moments don't make sense in regards to the see-it-from-the-get-go ""twist"" at the end (think High Tension)
- The story is a one-trick pony that doesn't do anything with it and goes exactly where you think it will.
- Unrealistic dialogue during high-escalation moments. These scenes could be solved if certain characters merely reacted realistically and stated the one thing that could quell the circumstance.
- Beautiful cinematography and a creepy atmosphere can't make up for a been-there-done-that plot that simply doesn't deliver on the initial premise.",1444003200,6,2642,5.1491841491841495

7435513,4,B015EVT7FI,"What perfect timing for Austrian filmmakers Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala's ""Goodnight Mommy"" to arrive alongside M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Visit"". While of vastly different origins both films are constructed from similar DNA, exploring the connection between parents and children, and how past tragedies can leave that bond murderously frayed. But that's about where the similarities end. ""Goodnight Mommy"" is a film with icewater coursing through its veins; coldly trapping us in an isolated nether realm where every neglectful action, every bitter word between mother and her sons is painful. Everything between them hurts us just as badly as it hurts them.

What's interesting about Franz and Fiala's approach is that they don't really try to hide the twist that is coming. Figuring it out doesn't take long, and knowing actually enhances every nerve-racking moment. We think, ""How long can this possibly go on?"", our stomachs tie into knots waiting for the blow-up that surely must come. Set in a lake-house somewhere in the Austrian countryside, we're introduced to twin siblings Elias and Luke (Elias and Lucas Schwarz), an adventurous duo with the twinkle of trouble-makers in their eyes. We see them exploring every inch of the peculiar locale; investigating caves, bouncing around on the oddly rubbery pavement, and capturing humongous beetles for their collection. What should be full of the exuberance of playful children is instead a strangely somber affair, instilling a sense of unease that will only get more intense as time passes.

It isn't long before we get an idea as to why. Their mother (Susanne Wuest), who has been gone for far too long, arrives home from some kind of radical reconstructive surgery. Her face bandaged up like a mummy, with only enough room for a pair of beady little eyes to peek through. Her demeanor is strangely cold; there's no show of joy at seeing her boys. Conversely, the twins suspect fairly quickly that she's not who she claims to be, and turn their attention towards proving it.

Tension mounts steadily from seemingly ordinary occurrences, expanded in significance by the imagination of a child's mind. A previously-unseen photograph of their mother in a family album draws their attention, not to mention her reluctance to answer simple questions. But is she really unable to answer their queries? Or is there a more sensible reason than that she's some kind of impostor? Teased is some kind of past turmoil between her and one of the brothers that causes her to be completely dismissive of him. It only adds to the growing mistrust, and a tightening of the sibling's bond against her. Soon, they're no longer asking questions, they're demanding answers.

The extent that ""us vs. her"" rivalry goes is perhaps ""Goodnight Mommy""'s greatest shock. This film goes places we would never expect it to go, and goes where other horrors wouldn't dare. In a way it would make for a good companion to ""The Babadook"", exploring maternal instinct, or lack thereof, from a horrific angle. Franz and Fiala pinpoint that gulf of secrecy between parents and the young children they don't understand, creating a chilly atmosphere that draws parallels to the work of Michael Haneke and Ulrich Seidl, the latter credited as a producer. The simple, minimal production design adds to the distress, opening up a vast emptiness impossible to ignore and tough to bear.

Parents with young children may never recover from what ""Goodnight Mommy"" does to them. Those without kids will probably want to keep it that way forever.",1443484800,,3559,5.087328767123288
7435514,3,B015EVT7FI,"This highly praised Austrian suspense film is well-constructed, gorgeous even, on nearly every technical level, but it left me empty and a shade frustrated.  The story turns on adolescent brothers (Elias and Lukas Schwarz) whose idyllic summer is disrupted by the return of their mother (Susanne Wuest) after reconstructive facial surgery.  The children are uncomfortable around this distant, bandage-swathed disciplinarian and begin to suspect she may be an impostor.  With each day, the atmosphere in their luxurious and secluded home grows more tense.  Can they trust their mother?  Is she safe around them?

Simply put, I regard this film as around an hour and 10 minutes of modestly creepy miscellany (a dead animal!  a dream sequence!  a field on fire!  a graveyard!) situated in a vacuum and doled out at a snail's pace, then a 30-minute blast of borderline torture pornography and a fairly predictable twist.  Yes, the cast is strong and in tune with the subjective space within which they must play, and the 35-millimeter cinematography is as elegant and Haneke-brand icy as the house where the action unfolds.  But I found it hard to detect a pulse beneath the veneer.  The characters constantly serve the contrived screenplay:  it demands, for example, they never bring a loved one or a doctor to the home or address any concern directly.  As a result, I never invested in their fate or felt scared for...or by...them.  And once the film's violent and sentimental final cards are dealt, the lengthy and deliberate buildup feels arbitrary in retrospect, its opacity more a shrewd gambit to earn festival-circuit laurels than an organic and earned preamble.",1443312000,9,1666,5.118518518518519
7435515,4,B015EVT7FI,"I had really been looking forward to seeing this, and finally did get to see the uncut version. It's a decent psychological horror film, and for some it will be tough to watch due to the nature of the material involving children. However, it's not nearly as provocative and disturbing as some have suggested.

SPOILERS

The story centers around two Austrian twin boys who are convinced that the bandaged woman that has returned from the hospital following an accident, is an impostor. The film suggests that the reason for their thinking is that the woman seems to be emotionally unbalanced, less patient with her son (s) just being 'boys' and a certain amount of creepiness felt by seeing glimpses of her disfigured face. It is those elements in ""Goodnight Mommy"" (""Ich Seh Ich Seh"") that work beautifully; creating a sense of subtle, carefully developing dread and promises of dark horrors to come.

Unfortunately the suspense and brooding terror does not sustain to the level it started with, as the movie starts to unravel toward the end with several awkwardly written sequences that strain credibility and at times, make absolutely no sense. As for a big twist in the story, unfortunately its not much of a surprise. Most viewers will figure it out shortly after the film begins.

Owing a lot to the somewhat better ""The Other"",""Goodnight Mommy"" is certainly an interesting movie with competent performances and a few scenes that produce mild chills. For me however, it left much to be desired. Perhaps with additional viewings, which I plan to undertake, I will appreciate the film more.

One note: The 'R' rating is ridiculous. There is almost zero profanity, no sex, very little violence and gore, and the female nudity is brief, partial and darkly lit. Obviously the MPAA was troubled by the theme to the extent that they slapped an 'R' on what would be considered a run-of-the-mill PG-13 movie",1443225600,3,1903,4.91588785046729
7435516,5,B015EVT7FI,"Definitely a contender for one of the most beautiful horror movies ever made. The cinematography is just gorgeous while maintaining a dark atmosphere. But its not just a pretty face, it has a pretty remarkable story as well. Its one of those movies that keeps you guessing, has the appropriate amount of strange, and its totally unique as well. The direction is very tight and there is never a dull moment, instead theres a constant tension, foreboding, and many questions arise. This movie is nothing short of brilliant.",1442880000,19,521,4.931818181818182

8733333,1,B015EVT7FI,"No. I did not like this movie at all. For me it was just a depressing, disturbing story, about this little boy's mental llness that I did not need to hear about this way. Don't like it that it is referred to as horror: thought it might be going that way in the beginning when she turns to face them in her bandages, and when she walked into the woods alone (not sure what that was about - maybe I am missing something?). Also,  it was slow.
 Needless to say I watched the whole thing, so sad for me.  Excellent acting from the boys. Loved the furnishings.",1532131200,,555,4.168224299065421
