4910960,5,B005ZLF7MA,"A brutal, moving, suspenseful and nuanced drama/thriller.  Apparently based on true stories, which take little imagination to believe, this film examines the horrid realities of the Bosnia war with a minimalist approach through the eyes of the protagonist, played wonderfully by Natasha Petrovic.  Dialogue is used sparingly but powerfully, with facial expressions and raw physicality doing most of the talking.  The last few scenes are quite amazing.  I've never seen anything quite like them.  A gem.",1514678400,2,502,5.552631578947368
4910961,5,B005ZLF7MA,Heartbreaking and powerful. Hard to watch but eye opening.,1514160000,5,58,5.555555555555555
4910962,5,B005ZLF7MA,"A devastating story told beautifully. With very few words we watch Samira go from joyous to broken, then from broken to healing. This movie is not easy to watch and shouldn't be, but I do think it is necessary. How do we do these things to each other?",1508889600,9,251,4.25
4910963,5,B005ZLF7MA,You should watch this movie if you have any questions about what Trump's Great America would look like. Especially in light of his association with Jeffrey Epstein.,1469404800,5,164,5.111111111111111
4910964,5,B005ZLF7MA,"A devastating account of inhumanity towards fellow countrymen/women in the name of religion, culture and tradition based on a novel and many true stories.  The acting and direction are superb.  Disturbing but rewarding.",1415491200,4,219,5.606060606060606
4910965,5,B005ZLF7MA,"Direction & acting carried out with loving care, portraying the utter depths of ugliness human beings inflict upon other human beings. As a sexual abuse survivor, I give HIGH marks to actress Natasha Petrovic, who portrays ""Samira"", a young teacher, rounded up by Bosnian Serb military forces and subjected to sexual assault and torture. Petrovic accurately portrays the disassociation, overwhelming grief and rage sexual assault victims/survivors experience. Director Juanita Wison paints a grim picture, highlighting it with bright spots of color. She uses monotone dour colors overall, interjecting them with brightness, which only accentuate the horrors portrayed. This is not a voyeuristic ""rape"" film, it is a film of emotional loss, a scraping away of humanity, disconnection, and ultimate survival. At times the film moves silently, allowing the hell to surface physically. The musical score is also quite moving. Excellent film, but not for the squeamish!",1392595200,15,964,5.609589041095891
4910966,5,B005ZLF7MA,"When the war broke out in Bosnia, I was studying in France. The besiege of my hometown, Sarajevo, was painful enough, and then one discovered Omarska, one of the death camps. During the anti-war demonstrations in Paris, one night a group of Macedonians approached us asking if any of us would want to work with the Bosnian ex-prisoners liberated by the Red Cross. I was the only one that had immediately accepted it. The others were hesitant, because nobody wanted to leave Paris and live about two hundred miles west in godforsaken Mayenne. I did. I became an Interpreter. Then we flew to Zagreb, an empty plane, just a few of us, with one of the French minsters. We were to get a load of refugees and bring them to France. The Serbs let them go under one condition: the Red Cross was supposed to take them to a ""Third Country."" First they were shipped to a big red Cross Center in Karlovac, Croatia, and then from there all around the world. Seven of them wound up in Haiti. When we landed at the Zagreb airport, one could notice a few bundles of people literally rounded up like sheep, with all their belongings, wearing colored ribbons. My group was yellow. They were relieved after I greeted them in our language, since they had been waiting there for hours for someone to just talk to them...
I could continue this story, telling you more details, but I only told you all this to connect a few dots. I spent about six months working with those people, and they were mostly male prisoners. Some of the horrific testimonies I have personally heard and interpreted you can find in the book by Rezak Hukanovic, THE TENTH CIRCLE OF HELL. I did not deal with any cases of women being raped and abused. Thus when I saw AS IF I AM NOT THERE, it has opened another door to my subconsciousness, as I had another sleepless night. I thought I forgot all those gruesome stories. Seeing this film I was speechless again. One is imbued by fear and wrath at the same time. One is appalled and helpless. A question will remain open forever: HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS TO OTHER PEOPLE? The history keeps repeating and, for whatever reason, Humans remain the bloodthirstiest species on Earth...  As if ""Humans"" and ""Humanity"" were composed of two different roots, like chalk and cheese.",1364860800,37,2288,4.580487804878048
8489786,4,B005ZLF7MA,"Excellent production following a young woman who travels to a small town to teach school, unwittingly putting herself in the path of a civil war, and the ugly business of ethnic cleansing. The movie is told from her point of view, through her arrival at the village, the soldiers arriving, the civilians getting murdered and raped, and her own victimization. She does what she has to survive, with great shame. The cinematography is beautiful, and the pacing is excellent. Explores the trauma of one woman without becoming too politicized or preachy.",1527897600,,550,5.054945054945055
8489787,4,B005ZLF7MA,"Very sad and intense film. I cried just watching that little girl, just a child being taken away to the torture of grown men. It's hard to believe that humans are capable of such cruelty.",1525392000,,187,4.371428571428571
8489788,3,B005ZLF7MA,"Really difficult to watch.  I was nearly overtaken with sadness and wanting with all my being not to believe that man is capable of such cruelty and brutality.  YET, it is true...",1524528000,,179,4.5625
8489789,1,B005ZLF7MA,"If you feel like being shocked by real human nature in a Slavic way Balkan style, indulge yourself.",1523059200,,99,4.555555555555555
8489790,5,B005ZLF7MA,"The movie does a very good job showing the helplessness of the captive women who never know what will happen next. They are numbed by the oppressive terror this causes until they become like cattle. The character played by Natasha Petrovic decides she'll do whatever she has to in order to survive. What struck me was how they were so silent when they were first abducted and the men were taken out and shot. I'd expect some screaming, but the whole village must have known what was coming and they were bleakly resigned to their fate.",1520121600,,535,4.583333333333333

8489792,5,B005ZLF7MA,"I was just a kid when I hear  things about a war in Bosnia. I knew very little about it & it had little meaning to me. Watching this film was a real eye opener. I was totally clueless that elsewhere in the world women & girls were enduring this kind of torture while the rest of the world went about their business. The fact that sons, husbands & fathers are capable of this kind of cruelty just sickens me. Things like this make me hope upon hope that there is a Hell for this sort of evil to languish in for eternity. This is one if those movies that sticks in your brain for days.",1517011200,4,583,4.025862068965517
8489793,5,B005ZLF7MA,"Intense film that, as being a woman., makes me angry and cringe at the same time.  It is based on true stories and it shows.  I watched another film based on this subject and time in history that was done by Hollywood and this film is so, so much better all around.  This is not a happy film, it is painful at times to watch, yet it carries a strong message about war and the treatment of civilians during war.  I really think it is worth a watch.",1516924800,3,447,4.045454545454546
