8191533,5,B000PHX4RE,"This documentary examines several aspects of artist Georgia's O'Keeffe's life and dismisses a number of stereotypes. Her close relationship to the people in the village of Abiquiu, the Hispanic boy she 'adopted' and taught to paint and questions of authenticity regarding significant American artwork combine to make a fascinating study for those who care for O'Keeffe and the Southwest.

This film is narrated by notable actress and Abiquiu resident, Marsha Mason.",1305417600,,465,5.549295774647887
