1614537,2,B00005K3N9,"I got this DVD as a gift because it was part of the collection of videos which include more advanced work. Having danced for several years, I have to warn the beginner that this DVD is not going to teach you the right moves or give you the bellydancing workout that you crave.
I was suprised to see that it was directed by a female because the video certainly spends the majority of the time highlighting Dophina's bellydancing physique and changing costumes rather than focusing on the actual moves and how to do them. So, in essence, this quickly became a Dolphina performance tribute rather than a lesson on bellydance techniqes.
If you know what you're doing, it's a simple refresher - once you get past the glamorous Dolphina aspects.
However, all in all, I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner or a learned bellydancer.",1046390400,3,824,4.689655172413793
1614538,3,B00005K3N9,"If you have no prior experience to belly dance, I really don't recommend this Dvd/Video.  If you do have previous experience in middle eastern dance and want a fun, new workout to do at home, this would be a good buy for you.
The theme of this video seems to be Dolphina's beauty rather than her dance skill.  She lacks rhythm and makes her routinues hard to follow.  Her worshiop of the goddess is appreciated here, but in a part of the workout she states to perform a move with the feeling, ""you know you want me, but you can't have me"", which is a representation of belly dancers that we are trying to get away from.  There are other more inspiring teachers/videos to first learn from such as Rania and Veena and Neena.",1043366400,11,722,4.365671641791045
1614539,5,B00005K3N9,"I love dancing and feeling sensual so this program helps me to achieve all these goals.  Bellydance is made Non-intimidating and easy and fun to learn.  Dolphina's narration helps to understand each movement.  I enjoy bellydancing and the way it contours the body.  I love her style, extremely feminine.  While this workout isn't too strenuous but I do sweat so I believe this is perfect for a beginner.  Her spectacular bellydance costumes are breathtaking and I truly think this is important to create excitement and lift energy.  I also feel the only drawback of this DVD is the photographer spending too footage on her face while I just want to watch the body movements.  After a few session it gets easier so I couldn't wait for the sequence. Ovarally it's a very well made program and there are very few programs outthere are as good as this one.",1032739200,11,852,4.70945945945946
1614540,5,B00005K3N9,"Once you get past the camera guy being in Love with Dolphina, you can get some great instruction on Belly Dancing for fitness. It's amazing that you can get such a great body workout while working on your self esteem too. I found that after I was finished with the tape that I was inspired to dance more and the tape had taught me enough moves to freeform belly dance.  Better than other belly dance instruction tapes.",1013644800,3,418,4.428571428571429
1614561,1,B00005K3N9,"This is absolutely the worst instructional bellydancing DVD I have come across yet - and I've been through about 20.  The beautiful costumes and sets cannot camouflage the fact this DVD is more about her ego and less about bellydancing.  However, if you're looking for laughs, be sure and stop here.",1204070400,,299,4.8431372549019605
1614562,2,B00005K3N9,"I was excited at first. I started feeling the burn with the arm moves. Beautiful scenery & costumes. I quickly got fustrated trying to follow what she was doing for hip, leg & footing- kinda hard when the camera only likes her upper body. She would be in the middle of a move & the camera would zone in on her chest, face, move on her smile- she would be done with the move & onto another one. I kept rewinding with no futher luck.
My opinion is that if your able to see her whole body doing the moves, it would be great for a beginner. I'm not wasting my money on her other videos!",1196640000,2,582,4.025862068965517
1614563,4,B00005K3N9,"This is one of the first Bellydance videos I've purchased, as a beginner. Dolphina sounds as if she is about to give you a 1-800 number for 69 cents a minute, but she won me over with the, ""(this move) says, You want me...but you can't have me."" I like how she repeats her directions and how she describes how the moves should be done. She's a respectfully sexy woman and that's not easy for an atteactive-looking American woman to achieve.

These are beginner moves. You learn to move your head, arms, hips, and legs. I'll admit, I really felt it in my abs! It takes practice and patience to get these moves down, but you'd be surprised how quickly you pick them up. May I suggest that you video tape yourself without thinking of the camera and/or practice the moves infront of a mirror. I didn't think I was getting the moves down until after I did that.

I also bought a video by the twins and I didn't care for it as much as Dolphina's. I plan to buy her second DVD.",1192579200,3,970,4.266304347826087
1614564,2,B00005K3N9,"Thankfully, I've become familiar with bellydance moves before trying this DVD.  Although the settings are beautiful and her costumes are gorgeous (good place to get ideas for your costumes by the way) the actual material is less than desirable.  First, Dolphina spends a lot of time chattering about eastern (Hindu) ideas like chakras and love energy and such while ignoring important historical tidbits such as where bellydance originates from, when and why it's practiced, and the different recognized styles (because there is more than one!!!)  Second, she does not spend enough time breaking down the moves you are about to learn, nor does she follow a coherent flow in teaching sets of moves (going from arms to hips, then back to chest, then to hips again, then arms...).  She tries to incorporate more advanced 'moves within moves' that will completely stump a newbie (shimmying while walking AND doing figure 8's).  Her routine at the end, poorly explained and running together without breakdowns and repeats, will be lost on all but professional dancers.  Third, and most importantly, her form is, quite often, poor.  I haven't learned from a teacher and even I can see that she isn't executing moves properly.  Save your money and buy someone else's instructional video.",1189900800,2,1280,5.1201923076923075
1614565,1,B00005K3N9,"Dolphina is a not belly dancer.
She is not flexible. Her technique is not good.  Her upper and lower body can not perform most of the moves correctly especially the camel and snake arms. The camera focused mostly on her face.  This is supposed to be an instructional video but there were too few body shots to display the technique.

Dolphina has no business teaching belly dance.",1188259200,2,380,4.641791044776119
1614566,2,B00005K3N9,"I have to agree with some other reviews. Eventhough, Dolphina is very pleasant and not nearly as stiff as some other instructors, the DVD was poorly made. Apparently, the cameraman did not understand his job. When Doplphina is describing a move, quite often that is all you get, instead of the view of what you are expected to do. This could have been a much better starter DVD for beginners. Don't get this DVD, if you are just starting out. For somebody very new at this, I would recommend Jenna's Belly Dance basics and beyond. If you already have an understanding of the basic moves and just want some variety, maybe you will like this DVD. It stays very basic and is a practice routine. You are not very likely to break a sweat with this one.",1185840000,2,747,4.45985401459854
1614567,5,B00005K3N9,"I am 52 and have given birth to 6 sons, last ones being twins.  I am so excited about this workout.  And Dolphina is absolutely adorable and is an excellent teacher.

I just ordered her Introduction to Bellydance for my daughter in law.

I highly recommend it and am looking forward to mastering bellydancing with the Goddess Workout by Dolphina.

1614568,2,B00005K3N9,The one good thing I can say is that some of the video was actually quite relaxing. The goddess/spiritual aspect kind of threw me off. You never have her tell you want to do with your arms when you're moving your hips or your legs. Half the time I followed her and half the time I had my arms waving around not knowing where to put them. The camera angles are off as most of these other reviews mention and she does appear to be seducing the camera man.,1172102400,2,453,4.101123595505618
1614569,4,B00005K3N9,"I liked this video, but at times I could not see what I was supposed to be doing with my hips and feet because of the camera operator. I like to be accurate and I'm pretty sure I was doing the movement correctly, but there was really no way to tell! There's a lot of close up shots when there really needs to be a full view at times and I think editing should have caught that before the DVD went out. Also, it seemed as though this was a religous thing as well (although I didn't take it as that, I just kept it strictly a workout). I think it made me a little uneasy that she was makng it less of a workout video by saying things about the dance being for the goddess of love or something crazy like that. I'm Christian and I'm open to other faiths, but I don't like feeling like I'm APART of another faith by my actions (when clearly this is just a workout video).

I think this is a very fun workout though, not so much cardio like it says, but if you try to keep your arms working the way she does (like I did) you can DEFINITELY feel it. The hip motions I had learned before from a friend who has danced all of her life and I do think Dolphina taught them well...except for the camera person not getting a good shot. I loved the moves and I'm thinking about getting the advanced DVD. I'm just hoping the camera operator isn't distracted in the next one.",1168819200,2,1359,4.07089552238806
1614570,2,B00005K3N9,"The camera man is preoccupied with either her navel or her smile in this video.  You have glimpses to the feet and leg work required to do the hip work.  This could have been a great video had the camera man done his job.  Instead, you have footage of unhelpful information throughout this video.  It was like the camera could not get far enough in the space it where it was filmed.  The best part of this video is the warmup which was professional (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star).",1167868800,2,491,4.180851063829787
1614583,1,B00005K3N9,"I bought this DVD based on the positive reviews it had.  (I notice that there are more negative reviews now.  I wish more people had reviewed it earlier so I could have saved my money.)

The good points:

* She is quite graceful and seems to know what she is doing
* She generally explains the moves quite well
* Her costumes and the sets are both beautiful and non-distracting
* The DVD contains both a warmup and a cooldown

The bad points:

* The camera never seemed to be pointing at the part of her I needed to see.  It focused too much on her face, and very rarely seemed to show her whole body.  This made it almost impossible to see what she was doing and to follow correctly.

* I felt quite uncomfortable with her spiritual attitude throughout the DVD.  I thought the ""Goddess"" part was about being comfortable with your own body, but it felt almost pagan to me at times.  I found it completely distracting to hear the repeated references to chakras and ""goddess energy"", and very offputting.

* It didn't provide much of a workout.

In short, I used this DVD twice (to give it a fair chance - I was ready to quit after the first 20 minutes).  Then I threw it away.  Don't buy this one.  Neena and Veena is much better.",1158710400,2,1229,4.278260869565218
1614584,2,B00005K3N9,"No, this is NOT the same Dolphina that I saw in ""The Goddess Workout - Advanced Bellydance""...

This time she tries really hard to convince you that bellydance is the best way to seduce men. She ends up looking like a strikingly untalented actress from a really corny movie. In addition to all her ""sultry"" faces and intonation, she constantly says something perfectly silly/irrelevant. If she'd titled this video ""Parody of Bellydance"", or better yet ""Parody of Playboy"", I'd have rated it higher - it is quite funny. But apparently she meant to be inspirational  :-D

If you are looking for a motivational video that would make you smile in a good way, get ""Bellydance for Romance"" with Jayna. Jayna manages to look... mmm... desirable... without losing taste and sense of humor.

If you are looking for a quality instruction, quality workout, and overall quality video, ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"" is unmatched.

If you are looking for a comedy, then you just found the right video. It's not only Dolphina's awkward manners that make it worth watching. Most of the moves are so sloppily explained and soooooo sloppily shown here... or not shown at all since her camera operator usually gets distracted with something else. The more complicated the move is, the less time Dolphina spends on it... and the camera person basically misses it! Sometimes Dolphina just gets confused:

- She breaks down a vertical chest circle, then picks up speed with a horizontal one, then walks with a vertical one.

- She breaks down what she calls ""Snakes"" - a figure that I'd never seen before. Then it turns out the figure is so complicated that Dolphina herself can't perform it up to speed and ends up doing a regular upward hip circle.

- She tells you to alternate between the upper and lower body undulation, but doesn't bother to alternate them herself, sticking to just the lower body undulation.

Most amusingly, she usually can't control her clumsy hands and arms. I also love her weird habit of counting from 1 to 8... because she enjoys it so much... why care for those poor folks who want to hear the music? The routine at the end is a delight: The choreography and the music are a perfect mismatch. I guess both Dolphina and the camera operator were high on drugs while making this video...

On a serious note, I actually do appreciate Dolphina's attempts to convey to the viewer that bellydance is fun and accessible to everyone. OK, she failed, but at least she sincerely tried. I've seen instructors that didn't try in any way to make learning from them enjoyable. Suzanna in her ""Precision motion workout"" or Nourhan in ""Introduction to bellydance technique"" try to pack a lot of material in one DVD, and they end up presenting it in a totally unusable way. I'd say their approach is even worse than the one in this psychedelic workout.

At least Dolphina invested in making her scenery outstanding. And she changes not only backgrounds but also her cute outfits frequently, which I always appreciate in workouts, as I do get a bit tired of looking at the same costume for too long. And she has picked pretty addictive music (if you can hear it through her ""enlightening"" talk and compulsive counting).",1156896000,5,3213,4.781588447653429
1614585,5,B00005K3N9,"I am very glad that I purchased this DVD.  Honestly, it gives you a very good workout for your body.  I bought this dvd to help me shape up my abs, waist and increase my flexibility in which it does just that.  I don't know how one person said that she didn't sweat, because by time the warm-up was over I was drenched.  Maybe she wasn't doing the movements correctly. I notice a difference in my body already.  I would give this dvd more stars if I could.",1152835200,2,456,4.136363636363637

1614587,4,B00005K3N9,"If you're looking for an in-depth intructional video, this is not it.  Nor is it a high-impact cardio workout.  I'd say that it's more for muscular tone & endurance (my arms were BURNING by the time the warmup was over!), and it's also pretty relaxing.  The camera work was pretty bad, but not quite as abysmal as it's been made out to be.  When you can't see the appropriate body part, it's often during repetitions of a move she's already shown you - if you have any kind of dance experience at all, it shouldn't throw you *too* much.

As I said, if you want detailed instruction in proper belly dance technique, this is not the video for you.  If, however, you want something fun and different to add to your exercise repertoire, you just might enjoy this.",1147046400,2,759,4.463768115942029
1614588,1,B00005K3N9,"...0 stars, actually. Gosh, I wish I'd bought something on salsa instead. I suppose they could have been less informative about how to do the different moves in the workout, but I'm not sure how. Basically I spent 15 bucks to find out how sexy Dolphina is, and how she knows nothing at all about chakras, kundalini, or the actual mechanics of belly dancing. Yee-ha.",1145923200,2,365,4.630769230769231
1614589,4,B00005K3N9,"I consider this to be my more relaxing workout. It is low impact, but massages muscles and helps my body feel great after a long day.

The camera work in certain sections could have been better, thus I took off a star. However many of the sections do not require the full body to be shown due to the area of isolation. The section that could have used the most work was the Hips section, since you can barely see them for most of it.

The sections that stand out as the best in my opinion are the warmup, head and arms, chest and shoulders, and the shimmy. After that the hip circles and undulations. The hips section is poorly filmed and there also seems to be an editing flaw.

Once the workout has been done a few times, the workout does become more clear. I don't think this is a workout to form an opinion about after the first use.",1140652800,4,837,4.186335403726708
1614590,1,B00005K3N9,"I guess the camera operator was a guy, because throughout the workout the camera is focused on her breasts leaving you clueless to what you're supposed to be doing.  Your money would be better spent on another video.

1614591,3,B00005K3N9,"This is more of an instructional video. The camera shots annoyed me only when it focused on the instructor's face at inappropriate times that I wanted to see the movement performed! I can tell the instructor is experienced in this dance and compared to other Bellydance videos, she actually explained certain movements with precision.  I loved seeing her many dancing costumes, she's beautiful to watch and I appreciated her telling us spiritual and historical background of bellydancing. I feel it's more of an entertaining video to watch than to workout to.",1135728000,4,559,5.142857142857143

This is not a real aerobic workout.  It takes a while to get used to the moves and be able to feel as if you can do them.  If you're rhythmically challenged... this will be a toughie.  Dolpina is also very weird... but i found that entertaining.",1133395200,,458,4.445783132530121
1614624,2,B00005K3N9,"The only real problem I had with this was that the camera work in certain places is positively awful, while in others it's quite silly.  For most of the workout the camera is focused on her face and upper body even while the lower body is being worked.  This is a particular problem in the ""hips"" section.  It is possible to infer what you should be doing with your legs, but it's not always shown clearly.  In other places, effects have been added which are unnecessary and actually made me laugh.

You should also be prepared to hear a lot about The Goddess, since it is the goddess workout.  Moves are often explained by the way they relate to the chakras or Dolphina refers to their healing powers.

The sets are lovely to look at and the music is enjoyable.  It is possible to get past the shoddy camera work and follow the video, but it's not always easy.",1128556800,2,861,4.371069182389937

A number of the moves she does are beginner moves, but she never gives the proper name for the movements nor does she break it down for someone who is beginning.  I was familiar with the moves so followed along easily enough.  The worse part of the tape is the camera work!  Horrible!  The producers are so focused on using numerous camera angles that they miss a LOT of the movements that she is trying to teach.  The editing is so bad and choppy that it significantly disrupts the flow of a movement.  The ""routine"" is laughable.  Not only was it jerky, poorly filmed, poorly edited, it didn't make any use of the music that we are supposedly dancing to.  Nice costumes and sets, but save your money and find a tape that will actually teach you something about proper technique and give you a workout.",1128556800,3,985,4.33879781420765
1614626,4,B00005K3N9,"This is actually more of a DVD that teaches you how to bellydance rather than an actual workout.  However, I will say that when she has you holding your arms up in the air for extended periods of time, I feel the burn.  Even with that I still feel like I'm learning bellydance moves rather than doing a workout.

But it's fun to do.  And the routine at the end is a bit hard to follow due to the poor camera work.

The only major problem with this DVD is the camera work.  Whoever decided to focus on her face so much of the time, instead of her body, so the movements she was doing could be seen made a mistake!  But there's another thing about this DVD that bugs me and I can't quite put it into words.  Maybe the best way to express it is to say that on the one hand an atmosphere of the Divine Femminine is created and honored and she talks about the healing effects of opening the chakras that bellydance has, yet on the other hand, it looks like she might possibly have dyed her hair blonde, which kind of says bimbo!

However, she is an excellent teacher and this is DVD does teach a lot of bellydance moves.  I really feel that she does a good job of teaching all the various moves at a fairly leisurely pace and with lots of repitition, which makes them fairly easy to learn.

So to sum it all up:  I reccomend this video for Goddess Worshippers and for feeling like a Goddess!",1128470400,2,1386,4.149812734082397
1614627,4,B00005K3N9,"I have this video and also The Warrior Goddess, and Bellydance with Veils.

This is a very strange video, the camera work blows, Dolphina uses a strange fake seductive voice and vapid stare.  She also talks about her new age views, which is fine, except that combined with the fake sexy voice, it sounds like she's high on drugs.  It doesn't lend itself to thinking of her as an authority on dancing.

Besides that, there are actually some redeeming qualities to this video.  If you started with Veena and Neena's videos, this is more of a challenge.  There are new additonal moves on this video, plus she combines the moves into a short routine at the end (before the cool down).  It's also longer than the bellydance videos by the twins, so you will get more mileage out of it.

Dolphina starts with a warm up, shows technique in sections for upper and lower body, demonstrates a routine and then ends with a cool down.  From the beginning of the workout to the end, it's about 40-45 minutes.

If you start with the Veena and Neena as a foundation and move to this video, you will be able to make it past the crappy camera work, the phoney sex and Dolphina's odd counting.

Once you are done, move onto the The Warrior Goddess, the camera work is better, no sex bunny stares.  She did a much better job in that video.",1126483200,6,1319,4.427385892116183
1614628,2,B00005K3N9,"I kind of hate to give this DVD a bad review by virtue of Dolphina's philosophy being a very positive one that more women would do well to identify with. But her warm up section is really a joke. Her stretches and warm-up exercises do not appear to be based on yoga, basic bellydance moves, or even basic anatomy. Here's a tip: Don't flop your head around, especially backwards, it's bad for you!

All in all the descriptions of some of the basics are better in the Neena and Veena videos, so even the beginner section of Dolphina's video should be considered only by those who are of an intermediate skill level, preferably in conjunction with the guidance of an experienced teacher.

The general concensus seems to be the sets and costumes in this video are great, but the camera work is really really bad. I agree. The introduction to this video finds Dolphina giving us a laughable porn-starish introduction to Belly Dance, which makes it hard to take her seriously when she throws words like, ""Kundalini"" and ""Chakra"" around.

Lastly, the skills described leave a lot to be desired. Dolphina tells you to keep your torso still as you do certain hip-movements and yet when she demonstrates her entire body moves. Certainly the isolation required to master belly dance is a difficult skill to achieve, but I might have expected Dolphina, as an experienced teacher, to have it down pat!",1123977600,3,1388,4.75103734439834
1614629,1,B00005K3N9,"The Goddess Workout claims it will do two things--teach you how to bellydance and give you a workout.  It is effective at neither.  The only positive aspect of this workout is the eye candy.  The costumes and sets are gorgeous.  But this wasn't meant to be a performance video...it was meant to teach.

The main problem is the camera work.  Frequently, the camera focuses on Dolphina's face or chest when you're supposed to be doing things with the lower body.  At one point she said ""now let's add a leg movement.""  So I stood there waiting for the camera to show her leg (it was focused on her upper body).  And I kept waiting, and waiting.  Then we moved on to something else.  I never did figure out what she was doing with her leg.  Similar things happened throughout the workout.  The camera may focus on the proper area for a short time, but quickly moves somewhere else before you can get the movement down.

She explained a few things adequately, but others left me completely lost.  She would go on and on about ""goddess energy"" and chakras which did not help me with dance form at all.  She kept trying to act sexy which was really embarassing when one of my family members came in the room.  The way she behaves you'd think this was entertainment for men, not dance instruction for women.

Finally, the ""workout"" did not make me break a sweat, and I am in relatively poor shape.  There was a cool down, which was pretty silly because there was nothing to cool down from.",1117756800,50,1482,4.462686567164179
1614630,4,B00005K3N9,"I like this video enough to keep doing it, and it is beautifully filmed, but there are problems.  At times, even when you can see Dolphina's feet and she's explaining what she's doing, it's still not clear enough to follow.  Veena and Neena were able to explain some of the moves better, and Jillina also made them clearer to me.  This is a nice target toning workout, but it's not cardio.

The first week of my trying this dvd i wlll admit,  it  had a few parts that i was not used to doing. However after a few times of trying and relaxing into it, it became easier. You may not see or feel immediate results but just remember that you are toning and sculping your body and you have to do it at least 3 times a week. After about two weeks you will feel it. but over all i feel that it is a great work out. Perfect for moms working out with their children. You will have a blast!",1110412800,2,572,3.8803418803418803
1614632,3,B00005K3N9,"I love the music, set, and costumes in this DVD. And I think this is a great workout - to those who are not getting a workout, you need to be working harder to perfect the moves!! Either that or you need to go on to advanced. The workout is challenging and full of good belly dancing moves for a beginner like myself.

However, it does not take the place of a class with a live instructer to answer your questions and critique your form. Especially if you don't have a mirror to watch your form while you dance. I use this to practice when I'm not at my weekly class and find it far superior to other bellydance DVDs I have. It's worth it!

The only reason I gave it three stars instead of 5 is because too many times the camera focuses on her chest and face instead of her hips and feet - where the action is!! She is very pretty, but that is not what I bought the DVD for! : )",1101081600,2,878,3.9829545454545454
1614652,1,B00005K3N9,"I did this workout just once and had no desire to try again.  It was boring, hard to follow, and gave no cardio benefit to speak of.  The instructor's feet are partially covered by her costume at times so you can't see what you are supposed to be doing.  And when they say ""goddess workout"" that is what they mean - you get to hear about the instructor's religious views as they relate to bellydance.",1099267200,4,400,4.306666666666667
1614653,4,B00005K3N9,"While this isn't as fun as the Belly Queen DVD, it's much better if you're a beginner, not in shape, and really klutzy (like me) and she is very positive and talks about Goddess energy which can be very nice and soothing as well if you need to connect with female energy after working around males all day.  I'm not very disciplined at exercising but I keep coming back to this one because it's fun and simple enough that I can do it, yet challenging enough in other areas that I know I have a long ways to go before I'll actually be able to move on to the next one in the series.  Like the characters in Full Monty, I find myself trying to work out the moves in the oddest places.  I do recommend this workout DVD.",1093046400,4,715,4.129496402877698
1614654,3,B00005K3N9,Fun... but not recommended for beginners. I never tried bellydance before and I had problem in following her steps. The camera always focus on her face and she doesn't explain everything in details.,1091750400,2,198,5.03030303030303
1614655,3,B00005K3N9,"Overall, I did enjoy this DVD.  It's fun and not that difficult of a workout.  I've taken one class before so I'm familar with most of the moves.  This helps to compensate for shortcomings in the video.
Like many other posters pointed out, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired.  When Dolphina's doing lower body work, the camera is often focused on her face which is very unhelpful.  Another frustrating aspect is that she spends a lot of time of simpler moves (i.e., shimmy and head circles) but rushes through much harder moves (i.e., undulations and snakes).  This video would also be better if she spent more time on the routine - maybe go through it once slowly and then up to rhythm.
To end on a positive note, the scenery and costumes are lovely.  She is a good teacher and has a very calming demeanor.  I would recommend this DVD to someone who has taken a class before but not to a total novice.",1087344000,5,910,4.407185628742515
1614656,1,B00005K3N9,"Yawn!  Yawn!  Yawn!  This workout is awful.  It's so slow and boring.  She put more thought into her costumes and locales than the actual movements.  I take a bellydance fitness class at my gym and wanted something with high engery moves.  And despite it's claim, this workout was not high energy.  I don't even think I worked up a sweat.  I'm sorry but, I don't think that anyone needs to do 5 minutes of snake arms.  If you haven't worked out in the last year, you might find this tape interesting.  But if you've done any kind of bellydancing or excercise regularly, look elsewhere.",1087084800,,585,4.528846153846154
1614657,4,B00005K3N9,"This is a fun and entertaining workout. I am one of those people that NEVER wants to do anything but sit on the couch, but I enjoy doing the Goddess Workout. Some of the other reviews go on about how Dolphina does not teach ""real"" belly dance, or that there is too much yoga thrown in. For those people that want to learn ""real"" belly dance, take a class! This a fun workout that is not only enjoyable, but keeps you moveing. You will brake a sweat, but not so much you have to stop. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was that the camara does focus on her face alot.(It took some time, but I was able to get all the moves down!) I would recogmend this workout to anyone that is looking for a fun and new way to workout.",1084060800,,730,4.006849315068493
1614658,3,B00005K3N9,"When I purchased this DVD, I had been bellydancing for about 7 months. Luckily, I had such experience because Dolphina introduces EVERY introductory bellydance move that exists, oftentimes with little explanation. This workout is therefore very fast-paced in the sense that the instructor does not give her audience enough time to master one step before moving onto the next. Even if you are familiar with the moves, it is hard to absorb her techinique (especially with the lower body combinations) for two reasons: she was filmed mainly from the waist up and the attire she wears consists mostly of skirts, so when she's moving her hips, it's hard to tell how her legs control the motion. And forget the routine unless you watch it a few times first because she explains it while performing and expects you to just get it in one shot.
For anyone just starting, go for the Veena and Neena Basic Moves first and work your way up. As for you gurus, try this to test your knowledge, but don't expect a workout.",1079481600,9,1007,4.694915254237288
1614659,4,B00005K3N9,"To my surprise, this is the first workout video that I've ever tried that I actually had FUN doing.  However, it really isn't much of a workout - I didn't even break a sweat.  It's still good to mix in with your other workouts on days you want something less strenuous.  Another good point is the music, you get caught up in it, and the moves come more easily, I think.  Dolphina is lovely and a good motivator.  Camera angles leave a little to be desired, though, as previous reviews have stated - but I found that I could still figure things out after a few times through the DVD.",1076025600,,582,4.254545454545455
1614660,4,B00005K3N9,This is far from a workout.  The only part that makes you start to get warm is the shimmies and that lasts about a minute.  I was in a workout rut though and this got me motivated to move again.  It's great for something different and not too strenuous.  It's really more of an instructional dance video with a spiritual bent.,1074729600,2,326,4.295081967213115
1614681,3,B00005K3N9,"As many others have said too much of the DVD is spent on Dolphina and specific areas of Dolphina such as her face or breast.  The costumes are wonderful; she gives great history and is very motivational.  However, not enough repetition is given with certain moves.  Sometimes as she explained the moves the camera was on her face and never showed the move she was performing with her body parts.  The camera should be panned out completely when she is demonstrating and move and then it can refocus on her face or what have you.  The only reason I am able to follow about 75% of what Dolphina does is that I have taken a beginners class before.  I think I am going to try a different belly dance set.",1073865600,2,700,4.346153846153846
1614682,3,B00005K3N9,"Having just had a baby, I need a way to lose the leftover ""baby fat"" and bellydance has always appealed to me. The store where I purchased this video only carried this one and the next in this series, so there was no other selection. I wish now there had been because I've been somewhat disappointed with my choice.
Although the sets and costumes in this video are very beautiful, as is Dolphina, I found it very difficult to follow the moves and learn the basics. The camera spends too much time focused on either Dolphina's face or if not her face, then on a part of her body that is not being used for the dance move in question.
As mentioned by other reviewers, learning the moves is further impeded by the long, flowing skirts that Dolphina wears while showing dance moves involving her legs. The outfits are gorgous, however if I cannot do the dance, then the attire does not really matter.
The dance moves themselves are broken down into easy to follow instructions, however given the unhelpful camera angle and inability to see what you should be doing, the overall effect is disappointing.
Unless you already have a background in bellydance, I'd recommend skipping this video for one that is more useful.",1067731200,5,1213,4.6465116279069765
1614683,3,B00005K3N9,"I have taken two beginners belly dance classes, and I still had trouble following Dolphina.  I read the other reviews, and I now agree with those who complain about the camera angles.  There are several section where she is doing lower bodywork, but the camera is zoomed in on the face.  I also found it difficult to understand some of her lower bodywork because she wear longs flowing belly dance skirts.  I high recommend the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners series, because the dancers in those videos wear light leotards, not belly dance outfits.  When you are learning from a video, its very important to see how the body is moving, and its virtually impossible with Dolphina's long skirts.  However, if you know what you are doing, its a great workout.  Also, she had the best explanation of how to do snake arms I've heard yet.",1063238400,3,834,4.710344827586207
1614684,3,B00005K3N9,"I have very mixed feelings towards this workout. I like the bellydancing but something about Dolphina turns me off. It felt like she was trying to be a sex symbol and appeal to men at the same time as trying to connect with the women who are trying to learn the dance. As a result you get unnecessary foci and panning of her body which unfortunately inhibit the workout. This is particularly true where it gets into the really interesting hip movements. However, if you choose to ignore this you will still be able to learn a majority of the moves in the workout (She also isn't the best at giving directions, but it doesn't matter too much as this is a very loose, free formish workout).
Another issue is her vague goddess talk. Since she doesn't go very in depth about the history and legends she is referring to it ends up sounding very gimmicky, like a ploy to appeal to women seeking empowerment. It makes the dance seem more commercial, especially in light of her company goddesslife.
On the positive side, the sets and costumes are very beautiful. Her voice is very nice and soothing(although that is nullified somewhat by the empty goddess talk). Most importantly, it is fun!
If you want to see what bellydancing is like, want to experience something new and different, or want to add a little variety to your fitness regime (Be forewarned: this is not the best for cardio as it will barely raise your heart rate) then try this. If you want to seriously learn to bellydance I recommend you pick a workout that will illustrate all the moves fully.",1060128000,8,1554,4.573476702508961

1614687,5,B00005K3N9,"Dolphina was the first person I learned bellydance moves from. I own this one and the Warrior Goddess workout, which is much more advanced than the Introduction video. The rest of the tape is not high impact but if you are not accustomed to bellydance moves or are brand new at this you will definately feel yourself working. The history and the warmup in the beginning is very good. The background scenes and her outfits are not cheesy by any means. For me if I am stressed out then I put this on and at the end I feel 100% better. It will definately help you to relax after a rough or stress filled day. This is a good beginner video to start with and though the moves are basic in design they have a bit of a different flair than Rania and the Bellytwins have in their videos. I have to agree with several reviewers that in some of the segments they focus on her face and not the moves her body is doing. Her new line of videos that teach you the veil, finger zills and more advanced hip moves are very good and focus on her entire body. With the moves she teaches in them they have to do this. Also,the music to this video is great! I have the CD and a lot of the songs I use in my routines. Good luck and happy hunting in the world of bellydance.",1049414400,4,1251,4.110204081632653

There is a different segment for each part of the body, even concentrating on lower abdominals on one segment, upper on another and side abdominals(obliques)on yet another. I like how she breaks down the movements, shares fun girly facts, and makes you feel that you too can bellydance. Some of the movements are really difficult and I was laughing at myself, but I must admit that it was still fun and kept me moving the whole video. It was helpful to have the costume changes because then I remember and coordinate which muscles groups I workout by which color costume she is wearing.

Take the video in short steps which are clearly outlined at first, and work your way up to the full routine - just make sure to stretch out before and after. One of my top recommendations on anything, anywhere, ever.",1393891200,,633,4.693693693693693

The harsh lighting, overexposed film and sets barfing up middle eastern stereotypes could have been forgiven had there actually been something to learn from this DVD.

Dolphina smiles simperingly at the camera and tells us to move with attitude while we are to say something like ""I know you want me, but you can't have me.""

Uh, thanks, that really helped me to learn to belly dance.

Her movements have very little rhythmic or emotional relevance to the music playing quietly in the background. We rarely get to see anything other than her upper body/face, and her cues come late, if at all.
