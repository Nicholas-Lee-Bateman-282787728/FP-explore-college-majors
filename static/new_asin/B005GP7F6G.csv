8472142,5,B005GP7F6G,"The DVD refers to the 4 stages of ""Initiation"" which is another name for ""The Hero's Journey"" described by Joseph Campbell. It explains that the ayayhuasca ceremony allows people to die to their egos, to transcend their limited personas, and to discover their higher selves.
.
The Hero's Journey is the basis of all real healing, but allopathic medicine reduces healing to suppressing physical symptoms through drugs and surgery. Naturopathic Medicine is more comprehensive because it focuses on Causes, Prevention, and Cures, However, even Naturopathic Medicine does not include the level of soul healing implicit in the ayahuasca ceremony. That deprives people of the opportunity to transform the healing crisis into an occasion for growth, to transcend the everyday world, to discover their own magic, and to return to the world with the gift of insight and healing.

The Western world consigns us to a very low level of materialist consciousness -- the 3-dimensional world -- while shamanic cultures recognize nine dimensions. Every culture throughout history (except the modern West) has recognized that the purpose of life is to ""die before death"". In the West, we get stuck in our limited ""personas"" unless we discover how to take the ""Hero's Journey"".

The Hero's Journey includes expanding beyond the intellect, the Left Brain, to embrace the intuitive Right Brain. It is profoundly difficult to go through the Hero's Journey alone. So, shamanic cultures aid people in this powerful transformation through Vision Quests, the ayahuasca ceremony, and other means. The DVD explains that the greatest gift of ayahuasca is that it lets us discover our higher selves. It involves not just a profound opening of the mind, but also a deep opening of the heart, as well as a soul-level awakening.

Not everyone can go to the Amazon or is willing to undergo an ayahuasca ceremony. However, a growing number of Americans are encountering the Hero's Journey through Near Death Experiences (NDEs). In that sense, the opportunity for the Hero's Journey comes to them rather than their having to travel to the Amazon for the experience. The NDEs are a gift to the West because we lost our shamanic traditions during the 300 years of the Inquisition.

Native American cultures are very generous to share the gift of the ayahuasca ceremony with the rest of humanity. We are greatly in their debt and must do everything in our power to protect them from destruction by the oil companies, dams, loggers, soy farms, etc. that are threatening their survival and that of the Amazon. People who have had the opportunity to experience the ayahuasca ceremony in the Amazon under the guidance of shamans owe a special debt to help protect the rainforest, the river, and the indigenous cultures. If the Amazon is destroyed, it will not be able to be recovered. It would be encouraging to see Ayahuasca Tourists organize to support the Amazon and its peoples as their way of giving back for the generous gift of the ayahusaca ceremonies.

This DVD allows viewers to experience the ayahuasca ceremony, the Hero's Journey, vicariously. It's hard to imagine how any DVD could do anything more important!",1410566400,,3181,5.074569789674952
8472143,1,B005GP7F6G,"Boring.  I was waiting to hear all these secret cures that come from the Amazon, but I didn't hear much.  Maybe some secret came out at the end, but it was too tiresome to watch. Waste of money,  and it wasn't cheap.",1409616000,,216,4.095238095238095
8472144,1,B005GP7F6G,"This video is  an overly intellectual , totally verbal description. Ayahuasca is one of the most visceral encounters with the uber-reality anyone can have. They totally blew it. This video blows. And sucks.",1378857600,,206,5.242424242424242
8472145,5,B005GP7F6G,There is so much to learn about healing the physical and etheral bodies.  This movie takes you on a wonderful trip where you get to see people healed and then talk about their experiences.  It is very motivating . . .,1369958400,,217,4.2682926829268295
8472146,5,B005GP7F6G,"I've seen lots of westerners preaching about ayahuasca in a sort of Terence McKenna, new age way. They never let the actual shamans who work with this ""sacred plant"" (actually a blend of two plants) talk about their work in any real depth. Enter Alberto Villoldo, a man with a foot in the world of western medicine and one in the world of the Amazonian shamans who work with plants and nature to effect what we sometimes think of as ""miracle"" cures. Although he is the presenter of the film and does a good job, he also really let's the local healers share their knowledge.

If you have any interest in using ayahuasca medicinally, you should watch this film. If you are just curious about shamanic use of plants, it's for you too. Highly recommended.",1320624000,7,751,4.562962962962963
8472147,4,B005GP7F6G,"Alberto Villoldo is an anthropologist/psychologist/best-selling author who has spent over 25 years studying shamanic healing practices of the Amazon. In Amazonia, a new documentary on DVD from True Mind, he introduces viewers to the power of healing with jungle plants. Combining elements of spiritualism with healing, healers administer plants considered sacred to heal the whole person--the body, the spirit, and the mind.

One of the essentials of shamanism is ""seeing,"" or direct insight into the true causes of disease. Master practitioners from Peru's Madre de Dios River in the Amazon watershed heal with a ""brew"" called ""Ayahuasca"" (""the vine of the souls""); Villoldo chronicles their work and explores the history of plant-based healing.

According to Erowid.org, ""Ayahuasca is a powerfully psychedelic South American brew traditionally made from the B. caapi vine and admixtures such as P. viridis (and/or other DMT-containing plants). One of its primary effects is considered to be the vomiting (the purge) that accompanies the experience. The term ayahuasca is sometimes loosely used to mean any combination of an MAOI with DMT."" Its psychedelic qualities explain the visions its users experience. Villoldo refers to principals of brain science to explain the effects of Ayahuasca.

Amazonia includes interviews with experts discussing the use of Ayahuasca and people who have benefited from this form of healing relating their experiences. There are descriptions of the ceremonies in which the plant is used and explanations of its effects, many of which are spiritual. In listening to descriptions of the experience, one is reminded of the words of those who experimented with LSD in the 1960s, or at least the words of those who had positive experiences on acid.

Amazonia has a very new-agey feel, but the practice of shamanism and the use of Ayahuasca go back centuries. At the end of the documentary there is a disclaimer: ""The Producer, Director, and Crew and Cast do not endorse the use of ayahuasca or any other plant substances. This film documents medical anthropology and shamans in their native habitats and does not endorse the use of any non-prescription plant medicines.""",1320364800,7,2199,5.3468208092485545
