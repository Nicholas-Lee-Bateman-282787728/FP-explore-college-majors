7684283,5,B01CJSQELO,"This DVD directly makes you feel as if you are on a holiday. Sun, water and the bright blue sky and the natural sounds of water and birds. I immediately had a sense of seaside holidays. A great DVD which shows various regions. The radiant colors instantly struck me, especially the wonderful blue of the water. Magnificent scenery, almost deserted streets, like this exercising on the exercise bike or even on the treadmill is a lot of fun. A very nice DVD that I like to see over and over again.",1462838400,2,496,4.461538461538462
7684284,5,B01CJSQELO,"I really like the DVD. It is a great thing to be able to exercise in Paris on you exercise bike. You drive past the Seine or the Eiffel Tower, sometimes also through a park and then back through the busy city, so exercising is great fun. The images are very clear and the natural sounds which surround you, give you the feeling of actually being in Paris. This DVD gives you a great variety of exercising at home and at the same time seeing something of the world.",1460419200,2,464,4.224719101123595
7684285,5,B01CJSQELO,"Two brisk rides and one at a more leisurely pace with over an hour of colorful HD footage of the Netherlands and its charming windmills.  Professionally filmed in high quality HD in full color.  Actual soundtrack produced on location to give the  feeling of being on an actual cycle ride.  The only thing missing is the breeze blowing through your hair.  This is a very nice DVD and like all the others I have purchased from World Nature Videos it is a high quality product.  I really enjoy these virtual walk and virtual cycle ride DVDs with my exercise routine on my stationary bike, on my Gazelle or on a treadmill at the gym.  Many such as this one are great for just relaxing, too",1460332800,2,685,4.432
7684286,5,B01CJSQELO,From lovely rolling hills covered by vineyards to colorful flat lands this DVD is a tribute to the beauty of France's wine country.  This video plays on a continuous loop for an uninterrupted workout or relaxation.  The nature sounds are relaxing and it was professionally filmed in full HD color.  No shaky camera or amateur scenes.  Offers three different cycle rides through France's vineyards.,1460332800,,397,5.15625
7684287,5,B01CJSQELO,"Included on this DVD are the world famous historical landmarks in Paris such as the Eiffel Tower, Centre Pompidou, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame Cathedral, and The Louvre Museum.  All professional videography in full HD color with sounds from the actual locations that were filmed to give a more realistic walk of the city.  One of the three walks focuses on the lovely city parks of Paris and is almost 45 minutes long.  Truly a lovely video to cycle, jog or workout too.  I also enjoy just watching this video to relax.  It is lovely and loops for an uninterrupted workout.",1460332800,,573,4.633663366336633
7684288,5,B01CJSQELO,"I didn't realize that Olive trees were so lovely.  What a relaxing way to workout.  My eyes got tired of looking at the front of my exercise bike, now I enjoy a nice collection of these Virtual Cycle Rides DVDs.  It makes for a much nicer and more educational workout.  The three rides are filmed in full HD color with realistic nature sounds.  If you like you can add your own music in the background otherwise the nature sounds provide a nice diversion from the normal sounds at a fitness center.  This offers three different scenes of which the village scenes with the quaint stone roads is my favorite.  I really like the World Nature Videos they are a high quality product.",1460332800,4,678,4.508196721311475
7684289,5,B01CJSQELO,I especially enjoyed the sunset as it cast its golden glow over the lovely wheat fields and pastures of Northern France.  There are three rides on this DVD.  It offers a continuous loop feature so that there is no interruption in your workout.  This video is professionally filmed and is a high quality product which makes a wonderful tool to make any workout more interesting.  This DVD is one of the more relaxing ones as I peddle through the peaceful fields of wheat and rolling pastures.  The natural sounds of a gentle breeze and birds along the way give this a realistic feel.,1460332800,2,582,4.611650485436893
7684290,5,B01CJSQELO,I didn't realize that Spain had so many beautiful parks.  The scenes are lovely and there is one particular scene that looks as if you may almost go over the cliff.  Absolutely stunning videography.  A wonderful DVD that makes my workout lots more fun and interesting.  It is like a cycle ride through some of the most beautiful parts of Spain in full color with realistic relaxing sound.,1460332800,,388,4.661764705882353
7684291,5,B01CJSQELO,Amsterdam's historic district was my favorite walk of the three.  The charming quaint building and the brick streets make for an enjoyable virtual jog or cycle ride.  One of the rides even showed a windmill or two along with the lovely scenery of the Netherlands.  This is a great addition to my exercise dvd collection.  These videos are like taking a tour of a famous city without leaving your treadmill or exercise cycle.  A great companion to your exercise!,1460332800,,461,4.784810126582278
7684292,5,B01CJSQELO,"Bought this one as a test of whether I would like the Virtual Cycle Rides philosophy for creating these dvds.  WOW; I was stunned by how fabulously they succeeded, at least in achieving what I was looking for.  The video qualities are truly HD and I particularly appreciate the on-site-as-it-happens soundtrack.  They travel into nooks & crannies and venues that the typical tourist never sees or even knows exist.  I played it for the first time last night and immediately ordered two other destinations and put several more on a Wish List for future orders.  Hopefully VCR will continue to produce a growing list of visited cities & sites!  My ""Place Your Order""  finger is poised to click.",1502064000,,692,4.813559322033898
7684293,5,B01CJSQELO,The videos are of great quality and make you feel like you are really there!,1500595200,,76,4.133333333333334
7684294,1,B01CJSQELO,Made the wrong purchase.  I was expecting an instruction lead riding session.,1497657600,,77,5.416666666666667
7684295,5,B01CJSQELO,"Excellent video. I have several videos of this collection. This one is not a casual walk. It works well with the elliptical and with the walking treadmill- at a fast pace. The views are very nice. So entertaining, doing one hour of excercise goes so fast!!",1495929600,,256,4.586956521739131

7684298,5,B01CJSQELO,This was amazing. I hook up my music and ride along side the people and view another world. This is fabulous to bike to and the scenery is so different and fun. The video goes well with the speed of my stationary bike. Thank you for making my workout fun.,1490054400,,255,4.12
7684299,4,B01CJSQELO,A good value.  You get what you pay for and nothing more.,1488672000,,57,3.75
7684300,5,B01CJSQELO,"""Singapore with Music"" is great!  Not only do you get to see the beautiful city but it's the first virtual cycle DVD that Tony has produced that actually has music (techno type) to assist your cycling journey.  I hope Tony produces other DVDs with music in the future.  I have many of the other DVDs he has produced over the years with nature sounds, but it is nice to now have one with current music.  Thanks Tony!",1487289600,2,415,4.35064935064935
7684301,2,B01CJSQELO,Not all that interesting.,1487030400,,25,5.5
7684302,4,B01CJSQELO,Very nice visually. Not as long as I would like. Seems to be more for a fast walker since it occasionally will stop to look at something or be very close to people. But overall makes 30 minutes on an exercise bike go much faster.,1486425600,3,229,4.111111111111111

7684305,1,B01CJSQELO,"I have a lot of these videos, and enjoy them, so I am not new to the concept of a camera moving slowly along a road. But I've been all over northern France, and expected a good deal more visual interest than is shown in this painfully SLOW (jogging pace, NOT good for cycling training...at least, not if you ride faster than 5-7 mph) video. The first 20 minutes are just dirt road along fields. No different than I would see outside my window in central Maine- not worth paying money for. The second 20 minutes are maddening. When I see Mont St Michel in the distance, I think ""finally! I'm going to see something!"" But no. We wander around in the field, stopping sometimes, not only never getting closer to it, but instead, in almost Monty Python fashion, we keep moving backward, as the scene RESETS to exactly where it was 5 minutes ago. WTF???? I would give this zero stars if I could. I will buy some poster board and acrylic paint, splash it on and watch it dry for my next ride. It will be more interesting.",1482796800,,1014,4.342105263157895
7684306,5,B01CJSQELO,"I put a TV on my treadmill and now I watch these videos while exercising.
It makes the time pass much faster and not near as tired when I'm finished.",1482624000,3,149,4.0
7684307,5,B01CJSQELO,Good!,1479081600,,5,5.0
7684308,2,B01CJSQELO,"Expected more, quite boring, needed more of a workout.",1471478400,,54,5.111111111111111
7684309,5,B01CJSQELO,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  The first half of ride 1 is like a day at the beach.  About halfway in it transitions to a dirt road through a marshy area at what looks like low tide.  Then its back to the beach.  The first half of ride 2 is mostly on the side of a hill overlooking the coast with elevated views of the bluest water Ive ever seen.  The ride continues on a road through a beach community.  It then transitions to a more desert landscape with lots of maguey plants ending with a nice overlook of a coastal town.  Ride 3 begins with more green and less coast, but you do make your way there eventually.  This is diverse ride is great for those who like to mix it up.",1469664000,,751,4.2027972027972025
7684310,5,B01CJSQELO,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  The rides in this DVD are mostly flat with a very quick pace.  In ride 1 the sky is strikingly clear and blue as you cruise through some beautifully maintained vineyards intermingled with a couple of small towns.  Ride 2 is similar with a windmill in the middle and a nice little hill at the end.  Ride 3 is very fast and on a narrow road  you can practically feel the wind in your face.  Lots of beautiful scenery to pay attention to.",1469664000,,538,4.438775510204081
7684311,5,B01CJSQELO,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  Ride 1 is on a small road with slightly rolling hills through farm land and hay fields, as the hay bales that show up later attest.  It ends with a distant view of a small town.  Ride 2 has similar landscape, although the fields are greener.  The road flattens out a bit with corn on the right and cut hay fields on the left.  The road gradually becomes rougher with the ride eventually in the field itself. If you were to ride this terrain with a bike it would be hard and slow, but it seems smooth and relatively quick.  The third ride is similar, but even more picturesque.  Simply beautiful.  This DVD is a great motivator for a mostly flat high-speed ride.",1469664000,,764,4.4855072463768115
7684312,5,B01CJSQELO,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  This is a great intermediate ride.  The first 2 olive grove rides are pretty much exactly that  beginning on a small paved road on rolling hills through a number of olive groves with distant views of mountains.  These rides go at a good pace and you can easily get in and maintain your zone.  The third ride has fewer groves, but still provides a nice ride through a rich palette of browns, sandy tans, green, and of course sky blue.  There also appear to be desert palms and yucca plants.  The view at the end is worth the wait.",1469664000,,632,4.491228070175438
7684313,5,B01CJSQELO,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  This is a great recovery ride.  Ride 1 is waterways and mostly runs along a straight, flat paved path with a canal off to your right.  Occasionally the ride is diverted through a small town, but it always comes back to the canal.  Windmills first make their appearance in ride 2, but they are featured throughout it.  There are a few more people sharing the path on this ride, and the pace seems a bit slower, although it is still faster than a walk.  Near the end the ride transitions from a pave path to a dirt path, and slows quite a bit.  The ride ends close to a windmill with a Netherlands flag flying and a few other windmills off in the distance Very nice.  Ride 3 now has the canal on your left.  Trees and grass are green and lush.  Youll come across one more windmill not long after the midpoint of the ride.",1469664000,,922,4.3391812865497075
7684314,5,B01CJSQELO,Love it.....,1469491200,,12,5.5
7684315,5,B01CJSQELO,"No matter if you want to exercise in a park or in the city, with this DVD both is possible. I have known Amsterdam as a bicycle city but I didn`t thought that there were so many cyclists there. Because of these cyclists and other walkers the ride feels really realistic. You can also hear the sounds of the surroundings and you almost try to sidestep from oncoming cyclists, walkers or cars. It is great fun to exercise with this DVD and the time passes really fast with it. You can also have a great insight in this beautiful city and the beautiful green environment.",1468886400,2,568,4.419047619047619
7684316,5,B01CJSQELO,"What a wonderful taste of Amsterdam this DVD provides. From bustling streets to woodland parks to open countryside along the canal. Moving between dappled shade and bright sunshine.
You pass through residential streets, beside canals, tram lines and historic buildings and mingle with tourists, shoppers and many, many fellow cyclists!
The sounds of bird song, chatter, children, dogs and above all the merry jingling of bicycle bells all accompany you on your journey.
Amsterdam is a vibrant city and with this DVD you will really feel like you are there, surrounded by your fellow cyclists.",1463529600,2,592,5.242105263157895
7684317,3,B01CJSQELO,"To each his own!  I was somewhat disappointed in this dvd.  Cycle rides 1 and 2 take place for the most part on busy city streets.  Only the third cycle ride provides a more relaxing, scenic atmosphere.",1463443200,2,202,4.405405405405405
7684318,5,B01CJSQELO,"A beautiful DVD for my daily workout on the exercise bike. Sometimes you pass over wheat fields, sometimes you cycle in the middle of green lawns or you pass on a paved road next to them. It is nice that you also pass through small villages sometimes. I liked best that you often have wonderful views of the famous Mont Saint-Michel. The ringing of the church bells in this trip goes well with the images. It is just a pity that you can not get closer, unfortunately the ride ends at a fence. This DVD is a great addition to my collection.",1463356800,,539,4.294117647058823
7684319,5,B01CJSQELO,"Really suitable for the exercising at home. With this DVD you have some variety in your workout. I especially liked that it sometimes goes uphill and that we see small villages or the sea next to the beautiful olive trees. Here you can see another side of Spain, far away from the tourist attractions. Also the good weather, which is shown on the DVD, is an asset to the workout.",1463356800,,379,4.428571428571429
7684320,5,B01CJSQELO,I have about 12 of these CDs in this series now.  This one is one of the most interesting.  I will never get to Paris but feel that I have experienced Paris a bit now.,1463184000,11,167,3.742857142857143
7684321,5,B01CJSQELO,"With this DVD, you drive at various paces through different vineyards, but also small villages in France. I particularly like the colors that are on the DVD. The sky is mostly bright blue and the green vineyards look fantastic. Bicycle tour 1 and 2 have a yet more relaxed pace but the third track covers it all and I find them ideal for a very fast ride on the exercise bike. This ride goes quite rapidly through the beautiful countryside. I didn't know these areas of France yet, but this DVD gives me a nice impression .",1463011200,,523,4.402061855670103
8753322,4,B01CJSQELO,"I'm enjoying this cycling video that takes you around Paris. There are three 20 minute videos that all go at the same slow pace, which works for me. You get some nice views of Paris and you really do feel you are riding the streets yourself. At times I wish I had a bell on my stationary bike to move pedestrians out of the way. Bottom line, it keeps me riding for the full 20 minutes and more which is a miracle for me!",1536105600,,420,4.011904761904762

8753325,5,B01CJSQELO,"I bought this DVD to help me get through my aerobic exercise (using an exercise trampoline) with more excitement than just watching TV at the same time. I was really surprised! The locations, the upbeat music, the pace of the video, and seeing real people in these settings all made me feel like I was almost actually there in Singapore while I increased and decreased my steps and speed (with the help of a pedometer to track my distance). It is hard to explain but it made the workout much more exciting and enjoyable. I actually increased my time because it was so much more enjoyable. As I reach my fitness goals I intend to reward myself with some more of the DVDs in this series.  Highly recommended. I am looking forward to more in this series. The disc also came very fast with Amazon shipping. Great value for fitness. A++",1533686400,,831,4.503311258278146

8753327,5,B01CJSQELO,"I enjoyed watching the DVD. The locations were beautiful and the ride around town was pretty much like what one would encounter with riding a bike: the view from a bike, the scenery, traffic, and people not looking where they are going. The three walks are varied in length and speed. I did not mind that the scenes cut away to other scenes. It made for an interesting change of pace. I use it while on the treadmill. The scenery is inviting - makes me want to visit Amsterdam.",1522540800,,477,4.370786516853933
