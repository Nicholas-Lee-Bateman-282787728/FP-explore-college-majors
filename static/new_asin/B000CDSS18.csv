2459434,5,B000CDSS18,"It was one of the lowest points of his life... This is when Emmanuel connected with his true deep-down all-encompassing thirst and hunger to achieve his ultimate core desire - Emmanuel wanted to make life better for all of the disabled in Ghana.

Emmanuel decided to make it happen. His first project: Show everyone what a disabled person could do - Emmanuel was going to ride a bicycle across Ghana!

What an incredible success story!

This is a touching story which I actually first found as a DVD movie at our local Hollywood video store as I was browsing for something worthwhile to watch (that is such a chore these days).

After I had seen it and was moved to tears, I set my whole family down to watch this inspiring story together.

After renting it, I came here to Amazon.com to purchase this DVD because it is a keeper!

As Oprah Winfrey said, ""I think every parent should go take their children to see this movie because it will change the way your children think about what they can do and can be.""

As a happily married father of six I wholeheartedly agree!",1157500800,15,1070,4.484536082474227
2459435,4,B000CDSS18,"I bought the movie because it says on Amazon that it included ESPY Award Show footage but it doesn't and that disappointed me.

Still doesn't take away from the inspirational story but it's lame that it advertizes something that isn't on the dvd.",1155168000,,246,4.72093023255814
2459436,5,B000CDSS18,"Wow, ths was an incredible, inspiring film and I am going to share this with everyone I know.  Wow!!",1152921600,,100,4.2631578947368425
2459437,4,B000CDSS18,"Messed up statistic about Ghana - 10% of the population of 20 million is physically disabled in some way. These disabled people, if even allowed to live by their families (it's common to chuck disabled babies into the woods, as they represent some wrongdoing by the family), are expected to beg for a living.

This is changing slowly but surely because of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a man born with a deformed leg. His family did not cast him out, and his mother instilled in him the dignity of a man, not a second class citizen. Emmanuel rode a mountain bike across Ghana with one leg to start his crusade to change Ghanaian ideas about disabled people.

He eventually became a world class athlete and came to the U.S. for the surgery enabling him to use a prosthetic leg. His triumphant return to Ghana and subsequent projects on behalf of disabled people have helped change the mind of a resistant government and people. The crappy part is that legislation for the (equal) rights of disabled people is continuously back-burnered by the government.

Narrated by Oprah when necessary, but I won't hold that against it, as Emmanuel does most of the talking himself.",1152576000,2,1161,4.766169154228856

2459439,5,B000CDSS18,"The story itself it's very inspirational. Emmanuel is not only a motivation for the disabled in his country, but for the rest of the world. The way the producers put together the interviews, the places, the pictures, the people, etc. makes you see the story from different points of view. It takes you from one reality in California to another one in Ghana. It makes you see how the human being is an amazing creation, specially when he shows the best feelings for others and wants to really help and make a difference in his society. An uplifting story that shows real heroes, real people who can motivate you to be a better person in your daily actions.",1142726400,2,655,4.559322033898305
2459440,4,B000CDSS18,"One of the few truly inspiring movies I've ever seen.  Emmanuel's story is amazing.  What a great heart he has.  But also, two of the other ""challenged"" athletes in this film were equally as wow-worthy.  To see what they have accomplished and what they don't take for granted makes you feel ashamed for John Q. American's being such a gluttonous, whining and spoiled jerk!!  This film's endorsed by Oprah (and she even narrates parts of it), but it's good in spite of her usual sap. :-)  Nice pick on this one Oprah.",1140912000,3,516,4.554347826086956
2459441,5,B000CDSS18,"Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah shows us in this film what it means to confront fear, obstacles, and challenges, and overcome. This man, in spite of being born without one full leg, being abandoned by his father, and cast aside in a country where the disabled are shunned and ignored, decided on one course of action. And that was to become the best he could at whatever God put in front of him. He redefines what it means to be disabled and let things get in the way of becoming the person you want to be. Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have given us a lovely and inspiring portrait of a unique man. All of us so blessed with opportunities and unparalleled blessings would do well to watch, learn, and be humbled. The Free Wheelchair distribution scene Emmanuel organized for the people in his own home town is some of the most disturbing and touching video you can watch. Emmanuel long ago stopped thinking of himself. His heart is so outwardly focused that his example can only make us better people ourselves.",1139529600,46,997,4.544444444444444

2459461,5,B000CDSS18,"This is an unforgettable DVD, a true story.  We take our lives for granted in the United States.  Emmanuel, born with a birth defect, was abandoned by his father.  Life in Africa was rough for people like him.  The only thing he could do was beg in the streets for his living.  Emmanuel was not satisfied with that.  He wanted more.  He had physical goals and he was going to achieve them.  The movie showed how he reached his goals, and improved life, not only for himself, but for all disabled in his country.

2459501,5,B000CDSS18,"I originally watched this in a sociology class and loved it.  While watching it I knew I was going to make sure our boys watched it.  As an adult with a sense of personal responsibility I was often annoyed in such a class which seemed like a lesson to learn excuses for not making it in any situation in your life, so I was surprised to be exposed to Emmanuel's Gift in such a setting.  He overcame insurmountable odds instead of submitting to them and living the rest of his life with his list of excuses ready.  Emmanuel stands tall for all of those who would let anything in life hold them back.  At first I was tempted to compare him to others in the past who have made non-violent commendable efforts toward social change but then it hit me that he deserves better than that.  Let us add Emmanuel and his story to that list of household names;  comparison would cheapen his life and efforts.",1353369600,,896,4.36144578313253
2459512,5,B000CDSS18,"Emmanuel's Gift is a gift that all people can cherish. Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah is a genuine man with little education but an incredible ambition to help other disabled people overcome the stereotypes and misinformation spread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and around the world. He approached life as a simple man with a simple request: Give me a Bike and I will do the rest! And that he did! I met Emmanuel in Ghana in 2001 while serving with  Hope for Life Handicapped Brother's and Sisters House of Hospitality in Accra , Ghana . Emmanuel came in one day with a request, not for money or even food,but a bicycle so that he may ride across Ghana showing able -bodied people what disabled people can achieve on their own. Being he had only one functional leg, the result of childhood Polio, it was an interesting request to say the least. After discussing his request, I pointed Emmanuel to the Challenged Athletes Foundation , based in San Diego, California. The Challenged Athletes Foundation not only sent him the bike and other items, they followed him on his trip throughout Ghana. Later, they sponsored him to come to the US to compete and receive surgery to amputate his bad leg. They then fitted him for a prosthetic which he now uses to compete without the aid of crutches. Mr. yeboah has become quite the inspiration to disabled people across Ghana, the US and the world over. As the husband of a disabled Ghanaian, I whole-heartedly recommend this video to those who want to be inspired to feats of great strength and courage.",1334016000,3,1535,4.727611940298507

2459516,5,B000CDSS18,"This is one of the most compelling and inspirational stories I have ever seen.  After you watch this, you will feel that anything is possible and you will become more aware of how incredibly lucky we are to live in the United States.",1302739200,,233,4.4186046511627906
2459517,5,B000CDSS18,"We loved this film, and we loved the way it made us feel.  Emmanuel's gift to the world is definitely one worth sharing, and one worth watching.  This is a nicely made documentary that deals realistically with the obstacles that Emmanuel faced while growing up, culminating in his receiving a prosthetic leg in California.  From there, the film goes into his actions in Ghana after he has become a celebrity there, and it shows us all that he has been able to accomplish for the handicapped in his homeland.  In this way, this is almost two films, and one can easily stop watching halfway through and pick it up later to watch the rest.

Likewise, there are two tangential stories about people who end up touching Emmanuel's life--the stories of the late Jim McLaren and of Rudy Garcia-Tolson, two amputee-athletes whose stories are just as amazing as Emmanuel's.  These tangents are not negatives, as they could have been, but very positive additions that help us to understand the overall stories of amputee athletes much better.

All in all, I felt very moved and very inspired after watching this film.  I showed it to my 7th- and 8th-grade classes, and they were mesmerized by the story and by the people involved.  This is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone.

I do have an issue with Amazon's listing, though.  Robin Williams receives top billing for this film with Amazon, yet he has nothing to do with the film at all, other than presenting an award to Emmanuel.  Total screen time:  perhaps two minutes.  Likewise, Oprah Winfrey narrates much of the film, but not all of it.",1299542400,2,1595,4.7111913357400725
2459518,5,B000CDSS18,"This film is beautiful.  Emmanuel's quiet determination and absolute belief in goodness are nothing short of amazing.  If you ever have a day when you're feeling down and out or sorry for yourself - watch this film.  A young man that appears to have nothing will help you realize that everything that matters can begin with you.  If we had a world of Emmanuels, we'd all be crying with extreme gratitude and absolute happiness. If it's at all shaken, your faith in humanity will be restored.",1298937600,,491,4.674418604651163

One man faced his disability head on. He not only overcame his personal limitations; he transcended the conditions presented by his deformed leg. He dedicated his life to serve the higher mission. His deeds have improved the conditions for all of those like him in his homeland of Ghana West Africa. His tenacious actions have changed the perceptions and attitudes of people throughout the country.

This is an amazing saga that includes the fields of sports, medicine, charity, politics and education.

2459536,4,B000CDSS18,"""Emmanuel's Gift"" follows the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, born disabled in Ghana in 1977. In the land where, according to this documentary film, ten per cent of the population is born disabled and many of them have to beg in the street to live, Emmanuel sets out to make changes. His first step is a rather unique one, which is to write a letter to Challenged Athletes Foundation and ask them to send a bicycle to him. The Foundation agrees and Emmanuel rides the donated bicycle across Ghana to prove what he can do before the people.

Unfortunately the film does not have much footage of the sports activities of unstoppable Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, who even participates in triathlon race using an artificial limb. (He underwent the operation to use one in America in 2003 when this documentary film project started.)  Still you will be amazed by his strong will and determination and will also be attracted to his good, charming personality.

The 80 minute film directed by Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern moves fast and slick with Oprah Winfrey's narration, but perhaps some may say it is too fast. The social background of Ghana could have been explored more as well as the hardships Emmanuel and his mother must have suffered (her wonderful personality, it is clear, had a profound influence on the character of her son).

Still the documentary, short as it is, is a precious record about a person who made a difference.

(As to the Robin Williams credit, remember that he only appears in archive footage and that's about 30 seconds.)",1185408000,20,1535,4.7556390977443606

2459539,5,B000CDSS18,"watched this film because the DVD blurb by Oprah Winfrey (who narrates a good portion of the film) encourages ""every parent to take their children to see this movie."" And how many films have you watched that are set in Ghana?! Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah was born with a deformed leg and suffered all the disadvantages and humiliations you would expect in a third world country. His father deserted the family, then his mother died, but through perseverance of body, mind, and spirit, Emmanuel became a national hero as a champion of the disabled in Ghana. His initial feat was to ride a bike across Ghana on one leg to draw attention to the plight of the disabled; the rest of the documentary follows how this snowballed onto an international stage including visits with Kofi Annan (a Ghanaian), Robin Williams, and to even more remarkable athletic accomplishments. Emmanuel's ""gift"" involves a double entendre; he had his leg amputated and replaced by a prosthesis at Loma Linda Hospital in California, and of course his incredible story is a gift to all of us. Oprah was right; see this wonderful documentary about an incredible human being.",1169596800,26,1138,4.901554404145077

We watched it with our grandchildren ages 5 and 7, stopping it along the way to explain and answer their questions regarding disabilities in general and what they were observing in the film. They were mesmerized by what they were seeing and by the courage and perserverence which Emmanuel demonstrates. At times it is hard to understand and moves at a clip which required us to replay many sections in order to follow. Highly recommend for helping children become more comfortable with special needs members of their community. Emmanuel's commitment to use what was given to him to overcome his own limitations and in turn use his gifts for the benefit of others is an invaluable lesson for all of us and especially for children in their formative years.",1168473600,7,799,4.7898550724637685
