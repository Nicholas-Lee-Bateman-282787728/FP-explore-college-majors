7481473,2,B016ZGY5AI,"I was really hoping to like this but the camera work just killed it for me. Seriously awful shaky cam, rendering a massive chunk of the movie unwatchable. At least for me. If you like shaky cam, youll probably enjoy this because it has a decent enough story and action. But even when there are no action sequences, the camera is bouncing around. So annoying. The acting is okay, loads of zombies, decent pace, lots of blood. Could have been pretty good, but I rank it in the same place as Automaton Transfusion, another zombie movie that had the potential of being good but was killed by bad camera work. 1.5/5",1446508800,5,610,4.504504504504505

8737640,5,B016ZGY5AI,Really nice story with a modern feel.  The format they use demonstrates some aspects of our daily lives and how we would act post zombie outbreak.,1503014400,,146,4.615384615384615

8737643,4,B016ZGY5AI,The movie is in a point of view of a small child watching TV. And has a lot of fake commercials. Still a good movie. But lacks extras and trailers. It also doesn't have a chapter selection.,1469404800,,189,4.135135135135135

8737646,5,B016ZGY5AI,"There are so many zombie movies around and most seem to be just chase-around-and-shoot movies following a couple or group of friends blasting their way to the end. Re-Kill shares some of the ideas but feels fresher and much better made than the average outing. If you read the cover you'll know that there was a zombie outbreak 5 years ago which was somehow brought under control. Since then the uninfected have been gradually killing off the remaining zombies. And although you never really find out what caused the plague or how they managed to control it, it doesn't seem to matter as the rest of the story is quite engaging. In this version of earth there is a television show which follows groups of soldiers around as they root out and kill the zombies. This program is enormously popular and is broadcast with a 2 hour delay - the time it takes to retrieve and upload the data and get it to broadcast. Re-Kill is shot as a big documentary, as if you are watching the show yourself - complete with numerous ad breaks for various laughable products or viewer encouragements (if you have seen Starship Troopers you will remember the same idea being used). These moments tend to lighten the mood before plunging you back into the zombie killing - and there is plenty of it as there are hundreds of zombie actors and they run fast. I don't usually like running zombies but it really works in this case. There is a definite scenario outlined at the start and the final scenes tie up all the plot threads pretty well. As I have found with other 'After Dark Originals' films (and there are a few of them), Re-Kill is a cut above other, similarly themed films in conception, production values and implementation and is well worth a look.",1455235200,,1735,4.581993569131833
8737647,5,B016ZGY5AI,I bought this because my son and I both worked on the film. Although low budget it was pretty good for another Zombie film. Shipping was fine. Thanks.,1453420800,,150,4.392857142857143
8737648,1,B016ZGY5AI,"This movie sucked, and I was hoping it'd be awesome after the first 15-20 minutes, but it wasn't. I had to fast forward thru most of the movie.",1451692800,,143,4.142857142857143
