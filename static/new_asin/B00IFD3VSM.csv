8641857,5,B00IFD3VSM,"The Onedin Line: A Nautical Review

The Onedin Line, an epic BBC drama, covering 26 years in the lives of the Onedin family, ranks with Downton Abbey, Upstairs Downstairs, and (for those old enough to remember) The Forsyte Saga. The Onedin Line series covered ninety-one 50-minute episodes over eight seasons between 1971 and 1980, with a total of about 75 hours of viewing.

There are two dimensions to this story: The first is the ships  and the episodes and adventures involving the ships. The second dimension is the story of the family members and other people involved, their business ventures, their loves and conflicts, and their continued character development throughout the series. It was with regret when I finished watching the very last episode.

The ships are lovingly portrayed under sail from various angles and in various weather conditions. For most of the episodes, the credits and titles are set against continuous shots of the ships under sail. The music sound track is dramatic with the opening credits accompanied by the theme from Spartacus by Aram Khachaturian. Most of the music in the film is beautifully matched to the images on the screen.

These were actual tall ships sailing during the 1970s when the series was produced, and most are still sailing in 2018. Ships such as the full-rigged ships Danmark and Christian Radich; barques such as Eagle, Sagres, and Gorch Fock; the handsome brigantine Soren Larsen; several schooners and topsail schooners; and several small steamships and steam launches appropriate to the period of the late 19th Century.

The photography is beautifully done, with long, continuous views of these magnificent square-riggers under full sail. A close up looking straight down from the bowsprit of the Christian Radich with a bone in her teeth  the foam white against the sapphire blue of the sea  captures my rapt gaze. In contrast, in another scene I see a broadside view of the Danmark heeling over with upper and lower topsails only, along with topmast staysails and headsails, with the unruly sea all about. Later, with wind abated, I see the Danmark off her port bow, all her sails gently full with a trade wind, her hull slowly rising and falling with the gentle seas.

I have been aboard many of these ships when they called in Boston during Tall Ships Races. So when I saw deck views of the Danmark and other square riggers in The Onedin Line, I was held spellbound. I watched intently as a sailor wrapped a line around a belaying pin at the pin rail, although only once did I see a sailor finish off with the traditional half-hitch. Strangely, I saw no close-ups of a fife rail at the foot of the mast in the entire series. Long views along the deck with the web of lines, shrouds, stays, and backstays layered my memories of similar views seen previously on board and in photographs. There were numerous scenes of sailors hauling on sheets or halyards, which mimicked actions I have seen in documentaries of square riggers under sail.

Some mesmerizing views were taken from the tip end of the bowsprit looking aft, with the ship under full sail rushing toward the viewer, with white clouds in a blue sky to match the white sails and the blue sea. Some aerial views, showing the ships from various angles as the scenes rotated, caught the curve of the sails from lovely perspectives. It was sheer delight to view a ship broadside and see the graceful curve of her rail, from the bow with its gilded trail boards to the taffrail at the stern. A ship under full sail seen across a shimmering sea is true enchantment.

I must have memorized most of the photographs in the book Fifty South to Fifty South, because I recognized one of the pictures of a monstrous sea in the southern ocean taken from the deck of Wander Bird, the schooner Warwick Tompkins sailed around Cape Horn in 1936. Several scenes in The Onedin Line of a storm at sea used some clips from the movies that Warwick Tompkins shot. I immediately recognized the huge sea with its marbling of white foam, as well as a partial shot of the after deck of Wander Bird with its distinctive boom gallows. Even though the inserted film clips were black and white, they integrated well with the TV series which were shot in color.

The acting, costumes, and direction are first-rate. Continuity and consistency, however, are problematic, especially in the sailing sequences. In some of the early seasons, the captain is fond of saying, Wear ship, when near a rocky shore. Wearing ship takes a lot of sea room, and doing so on a lee shore could lead to some exciting, and even perilous, moments, because the ship loses distance downwind when wearing, and could fetch up aground. For all the times that wear ship was given as a command, there were no scenes of a square rigger actually going through the maneuver. Square riggers also have to regularly tack in order put the wind on the other side, but again, no such maneuver of coming about was shown in the series. It would have been fun to watch such things happening.

Another time I heard the captain say, Set the royals. That caught my attention because the ship at the time was under lower and upper topsails only; there were no topgallants set. Sails are normally set in sequence beginning with the lower topsails, then the upper topsails, then the courses (foresail and mainsail), and then up the mast with topgallants and royals. When sails are taken in, the reverse happens. So rather than order the royals set, the captain would first say, Set the topgallants. Then he would order the royals set. Taking in sails would occur down the mast, royals first, then topgallants, then skipping to the courses, then upper topsails. The lower topsails would be the last to come in.

Numerous continuity problems took me repeatedly out of the story. One such problem involved numerous scenes on the deck of a square rigger with the captain talking to James Onedin, followed by a close-up of the two against the background of masts and rigging of a schooner. Most viewers, I suppose, would not notice the difference, but for someone knowledgeable about such matters, it was disconcerting. On several occasions a ship would be shown in two successive scenes from different angles, but the two scenes actually showed two different ships, often the Danmark and Christian Radich. The two ships are so similar that the casual viewer would probably not notice the difference, but such discontinuities were noticeable. I have to admit I was watching for such incidents.

Several commands by the captain or the mate were actually incorrect for the action taking place on screen, and this took place frequently in the series. For example, a comment was made about a following wind, but from the position of the main boom of the schooner, it was clear the schooner was close-hauled, not sailing downwind. Similarly with the command to gybe during one of the later episodes; the schooners main sheet was keeping the main boom amidships, not payed out as it would have been just before the command to gybe. Many shots appear of various ships under way without sufficient wind to propel them at such a speed, judging from the calm surface of the water, also merit quibbles. But enough of such carping.

To sum up, the ships were magnificent and beautiful beyond words adequate to describe them. I felt a genuine appreciation for their appearances throughout the series. Its a rousing good yarn! I recommend watching all 75 hours.",1527120000,,7486,4.800465838509317
8641858,5,B00IFD3VSM,"I adore this series.  I first discovered it when I was a teen but the station that aired it couldn't broadcast the entire series.  Fast forward decades - I stumbled onto it and sampled it to determine if I still found it appealing; and I did.  Next step was to buy a copy of the series - something that I do not normally do but made an exception in this case because I loved the series.  This particular copy of the series is affordable, well-priced and of good quality.  The series is fantastic - well acted, well written, engaging.  It touches on historical events and issues and attitudes of the day as they relate to shipping, sailors, the working poor and women.  The series presents strong, savvy, determined women characters which appeals to modern audiences.  And the men are not stupid nor boorish nor womanizers - they have strong characters and multi-faceted personalities.  The characters actually talk to one another - unlike so many series today which are endless exchanges of one-liners.  Its a series you'll want to watch many times.",1499385600,,1049,4.745856353591161

Great story and picture quality is amazing, considering it was made in the early 1970  You need a multi region DVD player to watch it in North America. Worth it! Bought it on Amazon.com from 3rd party seller (Germany), excellent service & very fast delivery. MUCH FASTER DELIVERY than from England.",1463702400,,345,4.8474576271186445
