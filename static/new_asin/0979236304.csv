174195,5,0979236304,"Get goosebumps!

We tend to compartmentalize our lives.  We see sports as one thing, our faith as another, family stuff as another, our job as another, school as another and so on.

This video shows the integrity of professional athletes who are striving to live lives of faith as pro baseball players and connect the dots for us and our children.  It doesn't pretend to make these men out as saints, but as men who ""get it"" and see that their sports performance is just one part of the big picture.

And it is well done.  Not too heavy-handed or maudlin. Good for family viewing, for schools, for coaches, and even for Sunday School!  Awesome.",1179187200,11,644,4.547826086956522
174196,5,0979236304,I teach 9th grade Confirmation class and we showed this movie to the students. They were captivated and really enjoyed it. (Much different from their usual antsy behavior.) It reminds you what being a true sports hero really should mean.,1269129600,,237,4.95
174197,5,0979236304,"I was ordering this for a Christmas gift and wasn't sure I would get it on time because the ship time was 2 to 4 weeks.  I was pleasantly surprised to get it within a few days.  The item is exactly what I wanted and a great price. My 11 year old son loved the first baseball Champions of Faith, and I'm sure he will love this one as well. I would highly recommend it!",1261958400,,367,3.88
174198,5,0979236304,"In today's culture there aren't very many positive role models for kids in the movies, music or in professional sports.  This video is a great resource for positive role models.  I use this DVD when I teach my 5th grade religious education class.  They love it!",1254787200,,261,4.630434782608695
174199,1,0979236304,I have not received this product and I ordered it 12/19/08.  WIll not use this seller again.,1232236800,,92,4.411764705882353
174200,5,0979236304,"Fantastic movie -- the right length and fast-moving content mix to keep my 11-year old baseball fanatic son interested throughout.  These stories of faith would be appreciated by any believer, and really hit home with Catholics. Sets a terrific example for children, encouraging them to live their faith with confidence and not hide it to fit in with the crowd. Extremely well done. I'm going to buy it as a gift for all the young baseball fans in our circle.",1209600000,,459,4.7375
174201,5,0979236304,"Our high school youth group watched this DVD and it generated a huge discussion about faith and how we, as Catholics, are called to live out our faith. It's a real blessing to be able to share this type of spiritual witness with kids. The players' faith was genuine and sincere. They showed the kids that even with a very strong faith they're still not perfect and need encouragement and prayer every day. Mike Sweeney's story about how long it took for him to ask forgiveness was especially moving. This video would be great even for non-Catholics.",1201392000,8,549,4.670103092783505
174202,5,0979236304,"I highly recommend the purchase of it, not only for Roman Catholics, but all Christians. More than two dozen major league players, managers, and coaches share their stories of how the game of baseball strenghened their Catholic Faith. You will laugh, cry, and be awed by their stories of perseverance,family,teamwork,sacrifice,leadership,humility,and integrity, virtues all Christians should strive for in their daily lives, no matter what professions they are in. This DVD can also be used as a teaching tool, beause it includes a companion guide which includes a lesson plan for each baseball story which is told.  Baseball's more than just a game!",1201392000,,650,5.372549019607843
174203,5,0979236304,"My husband, 10-yr. old son, and I watched this movie last night for the first time. What an incredible experience!! The Holy Spirit had drawn me to this movie several times when I finally purchased for my son as a Christmas gift. He and my husband both are huge baseball fans and my son has been playing since he was 6 years old. The best part of the film for me is the great devotion and faith that comes from these highly successful athletes. It's one thing for us to try to share and teach our Catholic faith to our kids but incredibly effective for them to hear about the Lord, attending Mass,and overcoming lifes obstacles from major league baseball players. Part of the segment on Mike Sweeney demonstrated the power of forgiveness when we do make mistakes (as we all will). What another great lesson for us all! My son's eyes did not leave the television the entire time. I was also particularly touched by Jack McKeon's devotion to St. Terese.  I was not aware of his devotion but the power of the saints is one thing I try to ""drive home"" to my kids. I give this one a huge thumbs up!!!",1199664000,,1095,4.367647058823529
174204,5,0979236304,"I don't know what inspired this movie, but it is WONDERFULLY done! It is the perfect movie to watch as a family. It is a reminder that ""religious people"" are not only clergy members and/or those that have chosen a vocation dedicating themselves to GOD, but can be anyone in any place,at any time, in any profession. I am buying some for Christmas presents; who couldn't afford to be reminded how important GOD and FAITH is in our lives?",1194134400,,436,4.531645569620253
174205,5,0979236304,"My 13-year-old son watched this movie at his youth group and really enjoyed it.  We need to give our Catholic children support and role models and this film is doing just that.  Thank you and many blessings.

174206,5,0979236304,"I first saw this DVD reviewed in Our Sunday Visitor and ordered from the website given in that article.  It seems that this is a trailblazing DVD because it is appearing everywhere I look.  This Champions of Faith - Baseball Edition is so well done that it grips you from the very beginning.  I have always been a baseball fan, and I have always been a Catholic.  I am glad that this DVD is shown from the Catholic faith standard.  It is so touching that tears easily flow with the stories of these players who are not afraid to share their faith journey with others.  It is wonderful.  I have donated copies to two schools and will buy more to give away.

174207,5,0979236304,"I thought it was great to hear prime-time athletes share their stories of struggles and triumphs with regards to their Catholic faith.  The production values were high and there were some great stories in the DVD.  The kids like the chance to see sports highlights, but these really set the table for testimonies from the athletes.

We liked it so much we bought extra copies of the DVD and have given them away.  It would be great to see something like this with pro football players, but one wonders if the NFL would let anyone use their footage (brief as it might be) the way MLB allowed baseball footage to be used in this video.",1192579200,2,633,4.478260869565218
174208,5,0979236304,"Our entire family, including our 9 year old daughter who doesn't care for baseball but gets stuck watching a whole lot of it, loved this DVD.  We laughed, cried and talked about it's message for quite awhile and wish it were in the hands of every family in America.  Catholic and love baseball?  This is a MUST.  Marginal on either front?  You won't be after viewing this incredibly well made documentary.  We've watched it several more times and get more out of it each time.  'The Chicken runs at midnight' in particular gets all of us going.  Worth every penny!!",1192492800,2,565,4.58
174209,5,0979236304,"When I first heard about Champions, I immediately bought a copy and decided to watch it with my wife.  Of course I am a huge sports fan, and even though I know the DVD is about Faith, I was also interested in the sports aspect of it.  We watched the film, and before the credits could finish rolling, my wife was buying 6 copies for gifts to friends.  Since then we have bought more than 30 copies to distribute as meaningful gifts to our friends across the country.  And not only that, we have dedicated a number of hours running a fundraiser at our church.  We raised around $2300, selling 270 copies in two weekends.  And our parishioners are now enjoying the incredible emotions that the film brings to your heart, and spring it brings to your step.  If you are Catholic, your home should contain at least one copy.  It is important for ALL Catholics and all Christians to see this film.  And particularly important for all the Catholic youth to see this film.  Teeenagers, etc.  Wow, nice work Mr. Allen and Mr. DeBellis.  Thank you for this very important contribution that is changing lives - changing souls!  John O'Reilly, Carlsbad, California

P.S.  If you own this DVD, and for some reason have not sat down for 65 minutes to watch it....walk away from you computer right now and WATCH IT - what are you waiting for!  Go ahead, WATCH IT and put some real quality & meaningful & significant information in your head that you cannot find at this web site, or on cable TV!

God bless all!",1192492800,,1496,4.481481481481482
174210,5,0979236304,Im not a big baseball film so I wasn't all that interested in watching the film with my family.  It was so wonderful to see another side of these players that I never thought about..,1192492800,,182,4.2
174211,5,0979236304,"Lately, professional athletes have been getting a large amount of bad press.
If you think all athletes today are law breaking, ego maniacs, you have to watch the DVD ""Champions of Faith."" It will renew your faith as well as your faith in many of the professional ball players.
This is the first installment of a series and I can't wait for the next production.",1191369600,2,360,4.553846153846154
174212,5,0979236304,"Finally a movie that shows that there are good role models in baseball.  This movie is inspiring and touching, and a must see for all baseball fans.",1188864000,2,148,4.481481481481482
174213,5,0979236304,"As a mother of two sons who LOVE baseball (and the St. Louis Cardinals!), this Video was very inspiring.  Showing our young people that a Hero is someone who walks daily with our Heavenly Father and gives HIM the glory for their accomplishments and talents is SO refreshing!  This Video shows our human weakness and sinfulness as well as God's redeeming grace for the forgiveness of our sins and those around us.  What a blessing for any and every family!  Regardless of age or love of sports, you'll love it!",1184803200,6,509,4.622222222222222
174214,5,0979236304,This is a fabulous video!  Major figures in baseball describe how their lives are enriched by living their faith.  I bought this video to show the boy's youth group at my parish.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to help young people (as well as older folks) form a strong faith connection.  Champions of faith is a great video that counters the rhetoric that works to eliminate matters of faith from everyday life.  This video has my highest recommendation.,1182816000,9,460,4.7
174215,5,0979236304,"I was blown away by this video.  I was not sure what to expect.  Baseball and Faith?  I'm not a huge baseball fan (hubby is), but I do know many of these names listed on the video.

I was captivated.  The hour flew by, and I was entranced.  I loved every minute of this movie.  Baseball stars - but you see them as real, struggling, human beings...the same as we all are.  It was so easy to resonate with their stories - their ups and downs.

Kids need excellent role models and heroes to look up to.  No need to look further than this video.

Adults need excellent reminders that we are all human, that we all fail, and that all that matters is our (struggling) faith in God.  A thousand years from now, all that matters is our relationship with God today.

Talk about an excellent gift for Dads for Father's Day; for graduates from college, high school, middle school, ok - any age!",1179187200,18,884,4.284848484848485

7794895,5,0979236304,"Excellent, well done.  Very inspirational to see so many athletes commitment to their faith and love for Jesus.  Appropriate for all Christians.  This movie speaks to all ages and rekindles faith.  Great role models for children.",1400716800,,229,5.277777777777778

7794897,4,0979236304,Great to hear men who have achieved great success in their sport to talk about giving their lives to worship of God.  Having met Mike Sweeney and David Eckstein--these gys are living out their faith honestly and genuinely.,1362528000,,222,4.842105263157895

7794899,5,0979236304,"This is the second in the Champions of Faith Baseball series, and is almost as good as the first! This DVD is a continuation of the first, in that it offers more about the lives and Catholic Faith journeys of the MLB stars, and gives more insight into their practice of the Catholic Faith in their lives and careers. Great film, and inspirational for any fan of baseball, regardless of your religious beliefs!",1291334400,2,409,4.616438356164384
