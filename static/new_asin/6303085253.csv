557821,5,6303085253,"Even though Robert Stack was up in years when this movie was made, he is STILL the best version of the leader of The Untouchables that ever existed. Plenty of action in this movie and a good story line. If I had to make a criticism of the movie the only thing I found fault with was there were no other members of the original Untouchables present in it. It would have been nice to see Lee or Rossi or any of the other stars appear with Ness. Still...it was great to see him handling a Tommygun and revolver again.",1388534400,,514,4.15
557822,5,6303085253,Robert Stack is the one the only Eliot ness! The story line is good & suspenseful. The action was good as well lots of shooting. I have seen this three times so far will see it again one day soon.,1370390400,,196,3.925

557824,3,6303085253,"I've been watching the original The Untouchables series on Me-TV. I was very young when the series aired originally, so I never watched it until I was an adult. I enjoyed The Untouchables so much that I ordered Seasons 1-3. I didn't realize Robert Stack had reprised his role as Eliot Ness in a made-for-tv movie; so I had ordered it, too.

I am happy that the late Robert Stack was able to reprise his role as Eliot Ness one last time; unfortunately, it was about 20 years too late in the making. The movie takes place in 1947, 15 years after Ness was instrumental in sending Al Capone to prison. In 1947, the real Eliot Ness would have been in his mid 40s. At 72 years old when this movie was made, Mr. Stack was still handsome and very eloquent looking; however, he certainly didn't look like a man in his mid 40s, and for me, that was a major problem watching this movie.

The Return of Eliot Ness had an interesting plot. Mr. Stack didn't miss a beat as Eliot Ness and the other actors were very good; however, I didn't like the bedroom scene with Lebine's son and the moll. Lebine's son should have listened to Ness.

I rate The Return of Eliot Ness a 3 because it should have been made in the late 60s or early 70s so it could have included the other original Untouchable cast members. This movie is for die-hard The Untouchable fans.",1326758400,2,1341,4.334661354581673

557826,5,6303085253,A terric sequel to the robert stack characterization of the principal star of the television series THE UNTOUCHABLES. Eliot Ness has aged gracefully. He is still a tiger after 15 years. The music is great and the casting well done. As in the series Eliot Ness though the star is not the central character in the story. His charisma and reputation are so powerful that with just a look or grimace he conveys to people what he wants. If you liked the series you will certainly enjoy this fitting epilog to the saga of THE UNTOUCHABLES.,1224028800,3,533,4.5625
557827,5,6303085253,"I'm perhaps not the best person to review this film, for me Robert Stack could never do any wrong. That said, it did keep me entertained throughout. The story was a good one with Ness coming back to Chicago to pay his respects to a dead friend and colleague. The friend it turns out has been accused of being on the take. Ness stays in Chicago to help his friend's son clear his name. The truth when it emerges is quite stunning. The son of the head of the local mafia family, being the villain of the piece together with his father's moll, ploting to take over the gambling operations and muscling in on other mafia families action by doing a deal with the commander of  the garrison where they store obsolete military weapons before being shipped out to be melted down. Ness's friend had discovered this and was set up to make it look as if he was corrupt. Robert Stack was 72 years old when he made this film. In my opinion he made a fine job of it, re-affirming my belief he was one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. Strongly recommended.",1198800000,24,1047,4.396907216494846
557828,5,6303085253,I loved watching the TV series the Untouchables when I was a young boy. I have recently purchased season 1 volumes 1 & 2 as they have just recently been released on DVD. They're great. Then I came across this. I ordered it and was very happy. Eliot Ness being much older coming out of retirement. Just seemed to put closure to the whole saga. The DVD is excellent in my opinion and a must have for those who enjoyed the Untouchables original series.,1194912000,14,449,4.357142857142857
