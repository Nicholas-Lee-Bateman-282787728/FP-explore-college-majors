8253184,3,B0013XSC80,"To start off, I like the ""Battlefield"" series of battle/campaign documentaries. I have purchased and reviewed many here on Amazon. However, I am often frustrated by the misnamed (I do not believe there is any attempt to mislead consumers) DVD's they produce. This DVD, labeled as ""Pearl Harbor"", in actuality, covers both the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor *and* the Japanese attack on Malaya and Singapore. So, unfortunately, you get half of what you thought you were buying and the other half is something you didn't order and perhaps didn't want.

The segment on Pearl Harbor is relatively good as usual, showing the lead-up to the battle beginning with the Japanese war on China and America's diplomatic responses. The DVD covers the Japanese strategy as well as American preparations (such as they were). It covers the personalities and commanders, the weapons (aircraft/ships) available to both sides and shows the pre-battle moves and the course of the battle very well.

The second segment on Malaya/Singapore covers the same topics just as well. One is awestruck by the resources the British had on hand compared to how poorly they were deployed and commanded. The defending British actually outnumbered the Japanese and still lost! The British army's doctrine was obviously at fault and were so road-bound that the simple Japanese tactic of outflanking British defenses through the jungle was completely effective from start to finish.

It's not a bad DVD. The two segments are professionally produced, use archival footage well, are informative in regards to commanders and weapons as well as the courses of the two battles. But, it's not ""as advertised"" and this series, for all its good qualities, remains difficult for the consumer to figure out by the description if one will actually get what one orders. I give it three stars for its good qualities.",1339286400,,1867,5.114754098360656
8253185,5,B0013XSC80,"Refreshingly,,,this isn't the usual,  standard ""USA!USA!USA! account"" of the attack of Pearl Harbour..but a more sober, rational, and detailed history to the build up and attack of Japanese military on the US naval base in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. (like the British narrator also)

It is short,,but concise.and yes, it includes the singapore attack too..as these are really in same stage of Japan's strategic maneuver to take the oil fields in the Indonesian islands as well. The attack at Pearl Harbour was actually a defense strategy for the attack on Singapore. The Japanese knew that attacking Singapore's ""Standard"" oil fields would result in the deployment of the US naval forces at Hawaii and a declaration of war by the USA, so did what they could to prevent or at least minimize this beforehand. (if didn't attack Pearl Harbour and went on to attack Singapore..it would leave a US naval force in full might to fight afterwards)",1328659200,2,934,5.019354838709678
8253186,3,B0013XSC80,"""Battlefield: Pearl Harbor"" does not indicate that more than half of the DVD contents shows the loss of Singapore to the Japanese, in the months following Japan's attack on Pear Harbor.  The DVD jacket and label offers no mention of this extensive content.

Winston Churchill called the defeat of British forces in Malaya and Singapore, and the sinking of the battleships Rodney and Prince of Wales,  ""The greatest disaster in our history"" and ""a grievous and shameful blow to British prestige.""

Although painful to watch, both battles are surveyed with adequate detail and strategic analysis.
