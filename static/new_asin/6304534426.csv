8341652,4,6304534426,"Blue Seed is a wonderful series. It does require patience to watch. While at first the seemingly endless stream of Arigami is dull, it is the development of the characters that makes this series special. I would reccomend Blue Seed to a person who likes romance, and is into character development more than fast paced action scenes, though there are some of those, they get somewhat repetetive. All in all, I love this series and hope to see the final episodes soon!",969753600,4,466,4.695121951219512
