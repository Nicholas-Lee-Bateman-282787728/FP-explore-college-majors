1862539,5,B00008V2VC,"The secret of the new moon is this:  Inu Yasha becomes fully human during the night of a full moon--one full night without his youkai enhanced senses, incredible strength and agility, and rapid healing.  One night of vulnerability a month normally wouldn't be so bad, but this is the night Inu Yasha and company find themselves stranded in a land infested with spider-headed demons.
In addition to the pitched supernatural battles Inu Yasha fans have come to know and love, there are some rare moments of tenderness between Kagome and the mortally wounded Inu Yasha.  In short, if you are an Inu Yasha fan or are wondering why you should be, don't miss this DVD!
The Inu Yasha series features moderate violence and occultic/horrific themes based in Japanese mythology which are probably too intense for small children.  I would therefore recommend this for viewers ages 13 and up.",1048896000,9,880,4.925675675675675
1862540,2,B00008V2VC,"Inu Yasha is a GREAT series. There's no doubt about it. So then why do I give it a 2 star review? This is because of Viz's decision to release three episodes per disc. While the three episode format is fine for a short thirteen episode series, it is simply Unacceptable for a series like Inu Yasha, which is 90+ episodes and still on air in Japan. Furthermore, Inuyasha is the kind of series which one has to watch a lot of before he/she becomes absorbed in it. Three episodes alone is an extremely meager offering, and I for one refuse to buy this on DVD.",1048636800,13,556,4.254716981132075
1862541,5,B00008V2VC,"The secret of the new moon is when inuyasha goes to his human side,they help a young woman who was attacked by a spider type demon,and stay the night than the spider demons attack the shire, and worst of all inuyasha turns to his human form right when he's battling!!!! and gives kagome some sweet words to her:)

1862542,5,B00008V2VC,"I haven't yet seen this DVD, but i have seen the episodes, in english and japanese, and i totally think you should buy this DVD! InuYasha is AWESOME!!!! Pretty much, you learn that InuYasha turns into a full demon during the new moon, and you get to see some cool spider monsters. I'll let you figure out the rest, cuz a summary of these eppies would just ruin it for you.",1048291200,,372,4.253521126760563
7987121,5,B00008V2VC,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Kagome learns that Inuyasha's demon powers disappear on the night of the new moon. Inuyasha's past also comes back to haunt him. A demon sorcerer resurrects his former lover, Kikyo. The encounter causes Kagome's feelings to go into disarray. Not to mention the emotional toll on Inuyasha, as his lover is forced to walk the earth as an undead.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353196800,,1489,4.450549450549451
7987122,5,B00008V2VC,"As Kagome tries to keep up with her social life and school in modern times, she constantly has to split her time with the search for the Shikon Jewel in Inuyasha's. When Kagome, Inuyasha, and Shippo come across a young girl who tells them her village is plagued by spider-demons, Inuyasha reluctantly agrees to help. But there's a problem. During certain periods of the moon cycle, half-demons lose their supernatural powers, becoming fully human for a night. And that night has arrived! The other two episodes are about a witch stealing Kikyo's ashes by desecrating her grave. If she carries through with her plans, Inuyasha might have to face the priestess that ensorcelled him a second time!

This show is very clever. I was really intrigued by the circumstances of what really happened the day Kikyo bound Inuyasha to the sacred tree 50 years ago. Both sides have their own version, each thinking the other betrayed them. It makes me want to know what really happened. I thought the love story that comes to light between the two was touching. This anime is way above average and owes that not only to the great animation but also the awesome stories of Rumiko Takahashi! Excellent show!",1122163200,,1191,4.809756097560975
7987123,5,B00008V2VC,"Inuyasha: Secret of the New Moon contains episodes 13-15 of Rumiko Takahashi's very long, and still in production at the time of this review, anime/manga series.  Inuyasha (""dog-demon"")is a young, brash hanyou (""half-demon"") living in feudal Japan.  His father was a powerful dog-demon, his mother a beautiful, high-class lady.  Inuyasha wants to be a full demon.  He is after the Sacred Jewel (""Shikon no Tama"") that will help him achieve this.

Kagome Higurashi is a 15 year-old girl who lives in a temple with her mother, younger brother, and grandfather.  Her grandfather tries to interest her in ancient stories of demons and the history of the temple, but Kagome is bored.  Her attitude changes when she is pulled down a well by a female centipede-demon.  Kagome is hurled into feudal Japan, where she meets Inuyasha.

Episode 13 - ""Mystery of the New Moon and the Black-Haired Inuyasha""

Inuyasha is acting strangely.  He does not want to help a girl in trouble; spider demons are attacking her village.  Kagome and Shippo, the little fox-demon, try to figure Inuyasha's strange behaviour out. The secret is that once a month, at the appearance of the new moon, Inuyasha is fully human until dawn.  Hello - he is a throughly dreamy human, with long, luxurious black hair and gorgeous brown eyes.  But, this night happens to be a terrible night of battling spider demons.  How will Inuyasha protect his friends and himself without being able to activate his powerful sword, Tetsusaiga?  What is this tender babble spilling out of Inuyasha about Kagome?

Episode 14 - Kikyo's Stolen Ashes

Just as things are beginning to settle, a horrible monkey wrench is thrown in the works.  The powerful witch Urusae steals the ashes of the priestess (""miko"") Kikyo, and seeks to reincarnate the powerful girl as an undead slave. Urusae wants Kikyo to gather the rest of the pieces of the Sacred Jewel so Urusae can become an all-powerful demoness.  This is a disturbing episode that is scary to watch.

Episode 15 - ""Return of the Tragic Priestess, Kikyo""

Urusae has kidnapped Kagome to steal her soul to animate Kikyo's body.  Although things don't go quite as planned for the demoness, Kikyo has a terrible hatred for Inuyasha.  What is their shared history?  The always beautiful animation is exceptional in this episode, as flashbacks of Inuyasha and Kikyo are set among brilliant autumn leaves.",1093824000,4,2395,4.957286432160804

7987129,5,B00008V2VC,"Inuyasha is an amazing series.  The story is addictive, the characters engaging and the quality of the animation and soundtrack is one of the best in production animation. This series is technically on the par with feature anime films.

VIZ/ShoPro does a great job bringing the series to DVD.  The product is excellent; menu screens are beautifully executed with and easy to navigate. The anime itself is crisp, colorful and the sound clear.  You'll also like the bonus line art and bi-lingual cast lists which correspond to each released episode.

The NA voice cast is nearly as well-matched to their characters as the original Japanese cast. But, if you don't like dubs, the subtitles are very well done.  No muddled ""Engrish"", and very close to original manga dialog so far! (Listening, Taiwan?)
I'd recommend this series to anyone who appreciates beautiful animation, a rousing adventure story, romance, or just a good, old fashion anime ""rice opera""! I'm looking forward to the next two scheduled releases this summer.  Hope you'll do the same.",1052092800,10,1049,5.063953488372093
