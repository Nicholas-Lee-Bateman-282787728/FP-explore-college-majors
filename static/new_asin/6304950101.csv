7879580,3,6304950101,"I have shown this video in a college course in personal finance, at a majority-female university. I believe it is more practical than Suze Orman's 9 Steps to Financial Freedom. Given its efficient format (about  half an hour, compared to Suze's 87 minutes), a lot less time is wasted as  you apprise yourself of the basics of personal finance. In addition,  although the financial topics selected focus on those areas which the  video's creators perceived to be weak points especially for women, there is  nothing particularly gynecocentric about it. Men who want a quick grounding  in the basics will benefit just as much as women and will not be made to  feel like outsiders. However, I believe it could have included more  information than it does. Some viewers may find that it offers less than  they expect. (This is the downside to its short length.) This is not an  advanced financial video by any means, so if you already know the basics  about mutual funds, retirement planning, and taxes, you will not find it  helpful. If, on the other hand, you want a very clear, well illustrated,  unintimidating introduction into personal financial planning so that you  can talk about the basics without sounding ignorant or pick up one of the  popular financial magazines without feeling stupid, this video may be for  you. Regarding its richness, I think you could watch it four times before  exhausting its utility as a learning aid.",956016000,,1435,4.8879668049792535
