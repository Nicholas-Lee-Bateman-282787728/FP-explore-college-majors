2299215,5,B0009KQP8W,"My daughter is 20 months old. She asks for the Teddy Bears all day long. She would watch it over and over and over non stop if I'd let her. It is not really Halloween, but it's the Care Bares and the Cousins in stories that have them in costume. Great fun for little ones and the lessons told in the stories are good; face your fears, don't judge a book by its cover, etc....  If you kid likes ""Teddy Bears"" they will love Care Bares.",1259971200,2,434,4.046511627906977
