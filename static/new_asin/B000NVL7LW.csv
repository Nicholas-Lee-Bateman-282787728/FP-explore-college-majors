8621638,2,B000NVL7LW,"Not a bad product if you like cooking reality shows, but it is too expensive (19.95 USD) for the length of the DVD. The DVD is about 20 minutes only (yes 20  minutes) and only covers one contestant! I guess the high cost is because it is made on order since it is not available. Remember it is a show that was cancelled way back by TLC.",1293580800,,336,4.014925373134329
