What we are now going through as a nation and seeing people come together from
all different views and cultures is brought to a head in this DVD through a picture of
The Soul.
Excellent information brought to you in stories, and a walk alongside figures of diverse
beliefs.
If you are interested in seeing what makes a soul from a world view, this video is for you.",1232582400,6,410,4.554054054054054
