8696239,5,B00RXPTROA,"We LOVE Baby Genius, and this DVD is no exception!  The music is soothing - and the kids love watching the animals!

We first purchased this DVD when taking out kids on their first road trip - they were completely engaged.  We feel great knowing that our kids are watching something enjoyable, while at the same time educational.

I recommend Baby Genius to all of our family and friends with small children!

Excellent price - Amazon provides you with a wonderful deal.",1454544000,,470,4.682926829268292
