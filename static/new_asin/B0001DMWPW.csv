The student makes the unwise decision to murder her, and eventually realizes that Tomie has been haunting him and his friends ever since which make this great somewhat mysterious mind play endieved slasher film .Makes this a superior  fine piece of work that should be remade .but by far articulate good film which I very much enjoyed and anyone would be greatly entertained by this movie ,and should go out and buy it,",1117324800,,522,4.494736842105263
8011237,3,B0001DMWPW,"The fourth film attempt at the ""Tomie"" saga borrows a bit from the ""Painter"" chapter, as well as the ""Hair"" chapters. Unfortunately, as Tomie movies go, this one is no better than the three before it. While the direction was interesting, the cinematography above average, and the chills effective, the film ultimately suffers from a cast of really.. well, bland characters. Don't get me wrong -- the movie had arguably THE BEST Tomie out of them all in Miki Sakai, and the supporting actors did the best they could with the limited material the studio provided, but -- the lack of actual captivating characters and working plot really halts the whole movie from realizing its potential. Hideo was the second most intriguing person after Tomie, and he was gone within the first 10 minutes. I think the final product would've been much more entertaining had the script followed more into the Hideo and Tomie's ""relationship"", as opposed to his boring and dull friends. A straight adaptation of the manga chapter, in other words.

And then there's the ""trademark"" slow pacing that seems to plague every single Tomie film in existence. I don't know about you, but I really dislike how the characters seem to slow down to an almost zombie-like state once they become involved in the main plot -- it happened toTsukiko in the original, it happened to Yumi and Fumihito in ""Replay"", and now it's happened to Hitomi and Takumi in ""Rebirth"". And with the lack of an actual coherent plot, this slug race becomes much less tolerable, and borderline irritating. Only Tomie herself should be allowed to move in half-dead fashion because that's essentially what she is, but for everyone else? Oh, God.

Nevertheless, it's not all lost; the movie redeems itself by casting Miki Sakai as the beautiful bakemono we've all come to love. Right away, she had the traditional look that had been missing since the original film (it seriously sucks that they didn't get Miki back for ""Forbidden Fruit"", by the way), and her portrayal of the character was much more lively and spunky than seen before. My only gripe here is that Miki's Tomie is slightly older than the ones from the previous movies and the source manga (she was 16-17 year old there; she seems about 20-ish here), but then again, it's almost a non-issue when you consider the rest of the characters also look to be in their early 20's as well. Had to bump Tomie up a few years to fit her in, I suppose. The gore and psychological scares have also been amped up slightly, although ""Replay"" still reigns as the better ""Tomie"" film in that department.

All in all, if you're a fan of the ""Tomie"" movies so far and had little to no problem accepting them as what they are, then you will enjoy ""Reborth"". If your introduction to the character is from Junji Ito's manga, and you hated all the movies so far... well, things aren't much better here than before. If anything, watch the movie for Miki's performance -- you'll see why she's arguably the best Tomie thus far.",1102982400,7,3006,4.732824427480916
8011238,5,B0001DMWPW,"I have read Junji Ito's macabre Tomie manga series, and found the majority of them to be a creepy fun read. When I came across the first Tomie film, I was very excited to see Ito's twisted tales translated to the screen. While keeping with some of the manga's storyline, the movie seemed to be more immersed in a sombre mood and had some great Argento-esque lighting which added to it's spooky ambience. The problem was that many rushed into this film expecting it to be along the lines of Ringu and felt the pacing of this film was to slow. Tomie: Replay came next, and with it a suprising change of pace. It adheres more to the manga storylines and has a much faster pace as well as being more gruesome while maintaining its scares and chills. A much more enjoyable film than it's predecessor. And now for Tomie: Rebirth...Although I have yet to see this one, I am extremely excited for this to be released. This is largely due to it being directed by Takashi Shimizu, best known for directing the Ju-on series ( 2 Japanese TV movies, 2 Japanese theatrical movies and an American remake which he is also directing ). Ju-on , like Ringu / The Ring, deals with a curse and how it affects everyone who comes into contact with it. To say anymore would be giving to much away of what I feel is one of the scariest movies to come along in a LONG time. The first of the two TV movies is what got me hooked. Although sharing many similarities to Ringu / The Ring, it's scares ( which are many ) are more malevolent and stuck with me long after watching these movies ( there are some sounds that I will never hear the same way again ). Tomie: Rebirth was made during the time between the Ju-on TV movies and the theatrical releases, and if they are anything like what Shimizu directed before and after, then Rebirth should be a thrilling and scary ride not to be missed.",1080518400,5,1863,4.35632183908046
