4570976,3,B0054YCDQ6,"I agree with the other posts.  I was so excited to see this on DVD, but it was not listed as being so short! I thought I was getting the entire season.  Why is it $22 for only 45 minutes worth of stories? I wish they had released more episodes. A few years ago, I wouldn't be this annoyed, but the economy sucks. I hate that I spent this much money on so litte .",1316822400,22,362,3.8133333333333335
4570977,3,B0054YCDQ6,"This is truly an amazing show, and I was very excited when I thought I bought an entire season, but this dvd is only 47 minutes, containing a single episode...A very good episode, but that's still pretty low!  8(",1316736000,25,212,4.435897435897436
4570978,3,B0054YCDQ6,Awesome show!! But I think the price is a little to high for just one episode. If you plan to release more on this show please have more then one episode on the dvd.,1316563200,4,165,3.8823529411764706
8457136,1,B0054YCDQ6,"God, I thought I was getting an entire season.  What a rip off to find out its only one episode!  ONE STINKEN EPISODE!!!!!!!!  Pisses me off so  bad, what a frigen RIP OFF!!!  Just because you feel you can exploit people doesn't mean you should, especially if they are fans.  What ever group of execs thought this was a good idea, YOU SUCK!  This is a perfect example of what is wrong in the world!

ps. love the show, one star cause one episode for the cost of a season!!

Totally steamed and bent out of shape,

8457137,1,B0054YCDQ6,"I would have bought the complete season 1 at, say, $30 for several people on my Christmas list. Clearly most fans of the show are going to wait for Biography's execs to realize how ridiculous and deluded they're being, releasing single episodes for $23. Also, FYI, Biography, even if you priced them at $5 each, no one wants a bunch of single-episode DVDs taking up space. Just release a reasonably priced, compact season package already to bring back your sales from the dead.",1322956800,9,477,4.759036144578313
8457138,2,B0054YCDQ6,The description is very misleading and doesn't mention that it is only one episode with three or four stories only.  I thought it was a whole season.,1321488000,4,149,4.518518518518518
8457139,1,B0054YCDQ6,never arrived and messaged amazon many times with no responce disgusting  disgusting treatment from amazon i will keep trying to get my goods or a refund,1320192000,2,153,4.884615384615385
8457140,1,B0054YCDQ6,"I have been checking into purchasing the first season ever since I watched the first season. I LOVE the show, but I was disgusted to find that the Biography channel was charging $24 per episode instead of having the option to buy the entire season at a reasonable price. Even when other shows release their entire season, the price is often a litte more, but it is never $24 per episode!!! I thought that if I waited they would probably release a complete season, but I have waited two years and nothing has changed. Now I will just record every episode's re-run on the DVR and then record it to a DVD and create my own set of every episode for the price of the blank DVD's.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, THEN MAYBE BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL WILL SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY A COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE PRICE TO OWN THE ENTIRE SEASON.  IF YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE OFFERING AN ENTIRE SEASON WITH THIS PURCHASE, YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED. It's a great show, but not worth even $22 per episode!!!!!",1319673600,3,1001,4.46448087431694
8457141,1,B0054YCDQ6,"For once, the reviewers have it right.  For 24.95 they give you ONE episode.  Absolute rip off.  I am very disappointed and cannot believe that the producers of this show would be so ignorant and arrogant to give you one episode for that much money.  One season worth of this show would be more like it.  Maybe we should all just complain and get our money back?  Very very disappointed.",1317427200,5,387,4.457142857142857
8457142,1,B0054YCDQ6,"I enjoy this show but on the listing, it says 9 dvd. It is only 1 DVD and it is less than an hour long. I was disappointed as I expected a complete series. Not only is it not a complete series, it also cuts the ending short. It stops in the middle of the narrator speaking. In short, I love the show but am disappointed in the description error. I thought I was getting a great deal for 9 dvds and ended up with 1 that I believe was over priced.",1317254400,6,445,3.847826086956522
8457143,1,B0054YCDQ6,Agree with the others. Was very excited to get what I thought was the 9DVD in the description. Very misleading.,1316995200,19,111,4.6
8457144,1,B0054YCDQ6,"I was very disappointed to receive only one 47 min dvd, when I thought I was buying the entire 9 dvd collection as the ad states. I find this very misleading and I will be hesitant to order anything else.",1316908800,10,204,4.125
8457145,1,B0054YCDQ6,"the title is very misleading how it is set up and with teh price , being Celebrity Ghost Stories 9DVD, a lot of people would think of 9 DVD's with this price for the whole season or seasons, very disappointed, also no mention of the minutes very misleading",1316908800,11,256,4.354166666666667
