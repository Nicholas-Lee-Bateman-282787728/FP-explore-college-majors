7132157,4,B00WGFHNKM,"Very informative and insightful movie.  It really provides an inside look on how the white supremacist education system attempts at all costs to marginalize and stunt the growth of black boys (and girls as well).  There is definitely a movement going on to dumb down the education system which not only affects black children but white children as well.  Years down the road, the public education system will be the lowest ranked system in the world.  Take a look at the steady growth of the charter school system.  There may be a time where the current public education system may become a thing of the past.",1478217600,5,609,4.7075471698113205

7132173,5,B00WGFHNKM,Education is deeper than just grades and test scores. Elementary Genocide 2 speaks to exactly that. The first Elementary Genocide documentary gave us more clarification on the school to prison pipeline problem and left us with a few seeds of thought for next steps. Elementary Genocide 2 provides solutions and thought-provoking insights into how to maintain a healthy community and bypass the prison pipeline. Rahiem Shabazz did a great job of delivering a message that can save generations to come.,1446249600,8,500,5.2625
