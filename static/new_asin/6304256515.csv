But in this common scenario, where a lunatic threatens the use of nukes and uses one as an example, the example should be in a populated area, for maximum affect. When a nuke is exploded in a wasteland like in this movie or underground , like in Broken Arrow, the audience has a feeling of ""Who Cares?"". ""Death and destruction"" without the death part, is never quite as effective. As for the plot and the action, it was very good. Absolutely no romance in the movie at all. Since the protagonist was faithfully married, that was ruled out from the beginning. This hurt the movie. Better than an action hero is a romantic action hero. Since his wife was never threatened or made an on screen appearance, the fact that  Jack was married served absolutely no purpose. The beautiful scientist's daughter , might just as well have been a male, since their was not even a hint of romantic undertones between her and any other characters. More than worth ,what I paid for it. The villain was good. The acting was good. The fighting was good. The fact that Jack lost all of his team was a plus. Should have added another minute or so to the final fight scene, but it was still avery good movie.",1239494400,,1222,4.455357142857143

Imagine, for a moment, the glory of special forces riding around a lake in neon jet skis shooting fireworks off them.  Apparently they were using the Las Vegas camouflage scheme.  This movie was good for many a hearty laugh, and I'm disappointed that it's not for sale as a DVD.",1055548800,,432,4.657894736842105
