8479496,5,B005MLTGL6,"If you're viewing this collection, you probably already know how fantastic Philibert's work is. And this is a great, albeit incomplete, collection. And it's great to have any collection of his stuff available. When I ordered this, I wasn't entirely sure on the details of what was in here, and the DVD cases contain some errors in their descriptions, so here's the breakdown:

- This package contains FOUR Region 2 DVDs, which in turn contain FIVE full-length films, along with a few extra items.
(I am in the US, and was able to play it on my Mac Laptop. Perhaps there is less concern about regions these days?)

- These are the original FRENCH LANGUAGE versions. You can turn on English subtitles, or watch without subtitles.

*** LA VILLE LOUVRE DVD ***
- La Ville Louvre (""The Louvre City"", 1990, 84 min)
Nothing else on this DVD

*** THE TRE ET AVOIR DVD ***
- tre et Avoir (""To Be and To Have"", 2002, 100 min). Probably his best known film, a delight to watch
- Trailer for tre et Avoir

*** THE ""BACK TO NORMANDY"" DVD ***
- Back to Normandy (""Retour en Normandie"", 2007, 108 min). My personal favorite of all his films that I've seen.
Nothing else on this DVD

*** THE NNETTE DVD ***
- Nnette (2010, 69 min)
- Trailer for Nnette
- Un Animal des Animaux (1994, 58 min)
- In a Badger's Skin (""Dans la Peau d'un Blaireau"", 1994, 7 min). Not listed on the DVD case, this short Philibert film shows a taxidermist preparing a Badger for display.
- Family Portrait (2 min). Also not listed on the DVD case. A short montage of plants, animal faces, and human faces. Kind of delightful. I couldn't find anything online about this short film. There are a few cards of French text at the beginning (no subtitles available for this film), talking about how the diversity of plant and animal life demonstrates millions of years of evolution, and that this includes the human race.
NOTE: This DVD case says it contains a ""Nicolas Philibert Interview"" but it isn't here.

** Here's what you DON'T get (in case you're trying to assemble a more exhaustive collection) **
- La Voix de son Matre (""His Master's Voice"", 1978). Mostly interviews featuring the heads of large French firms
- Le Pays Des Sourds (""In the Land of the Deaf"", 1992). An exceptional film about deaf culture in France
- La Moindre des choses (""Every Little Thing"", 1997). A portrait of a mental health hospital putting together a play
- Qui Sait (""Who Knows"", 1999). An experimental film, hard to find
- La Maison de la radio (2013). A film about Radio France (I haven't seen this one yet).",1519257600,,2551,4.520607375271149
8479497,5,B005MLTGL6,"One animal, some Animals is among the stars of this collection.
Graceful, beautiful documentary on the renovation of the Museum of Natural History in Paris.
Philibert should be known to all.  His work, as cliched as it sounds, is a national treasure.
The same intelligence, and lack of arrogance, resonates through his other films.
As I say, I wish he got more exposure.

It would be nice if there were small vimeo or youtube clips of his works on amazon, the way that there are short clips of music from an album.

You can play this on your computer if you change the region setting (it will ask you this and you can do it three or four times in the life of the computer)
and/or you can dedicate one computer to be set to another region.
See these films, buy them if you can.",1347926400,,776,4.337931034482758
