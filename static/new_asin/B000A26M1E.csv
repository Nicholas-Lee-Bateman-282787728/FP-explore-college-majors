2350212,4,B000A26M1E,"I usually go to yoga classes, but when I can't make it to an actual class this DVD is almost like being in a class. The voice instructions are really clear and are perfectly timed with the movements of the video, so when you look up, she's doing what you should be. The main flow contains every element an intermediate vinyasa person could want: pigeon, plow, eagle, wheel, triangle, extended side angle, etc. It's not a multi-level workout - if you can't do the exact poses, she doesn't offer many lower-level options.",1136073600,13,519,4.6521739130434785
2350213,5,B000A26M1E,"I have been practicing yoga for the last year and different types as well.  I found that this video was very easy to follow and did not go too fast.  There is a section where the poses do go faster and the purpose of that is to heat your body so that you are able to go deeper in your practice.  There were some things that I was able to do with ease and then others that I will work towards - which is great and gives me something to look foward to.

I found this a great compliment to my practice and would highly recommend this to anyone.",1128297600,10,541,3.9357798165137616
2350214,5,B000A26M1E,"I'm a runner and after an injury my wife suggested I try yoga so she bought me this DVD. I was impressed. I didn't have to chant, look out my ""third eye"" or any of that other yoga stuff. And it forced me to stretch which helped me recover from my injury and it's a good cross training tool. Overall, this is a pretty good dvd and it's helped me in competition.",1126310400,7,360,4.013888888888889
2350215,5,B000A26M1E,"After purchasing several yoga DVDs- I have finally found the ONE! This workout incorporates the basic principles of Vinyasa without the mind numbing bantor of other DVDs I've purchased. It allows you to enjoy the tranquility of a yoga class in your home. The workout itself is challenging but not overwhelming. I introduced my sister to this DVD, she was interested in yoga but felt intimidated by local yoga studios. As a novice, she felt challenged but confident and continues to practice (which by the way, has done wonders for her arthritis!) As a avid yogi, when unable to get to the studio, I can use this DVD and still get a great workout. This is a great DVD!!

Namaste!",1126310400,10,678,4.65
2350216,4,B000A26M1E,"Litsa Kapantais directs the mind and spirit by encouraging you to focus on your intention. By gently flowing through the poses you have the opportunity to discover and to cultivate a strong, flexible, and supple body. Based on my experience as a beginner to intermediate yogi, I suggest that you first watch the video in its entirity before you ever get on your mat. At times she moves very quickly through the poses. Until you are used to the pace of her practice, you may find yourself initially frustrated. Be patient! Take it slow and you will discover how nourishing this practice can be.",1123977600,5,593,4.711538461538462
2350217,5,B000A26M1E,"I am fortunate enough to live in Charlotte where Litsa teaches and have been taking classes from her for many years now.  She is hands down, without a doubt, the most innovative teacher I have ever encountered (and I have taken classes from many of the top teachers in the US) with regards to her sequencing and creativity.  This DVD will appeal to the advanced beginner or intermediate level student who loves Flow-style Yoga.  One of my favorite DVD's from my favorite teacher.  Well worth the purchase!",1258588800,,505,4.7701149425287355
2350218,5,B000A26M1E,"I received this DVD as a gift, and I am a beginner.  Perhaps the target audience for this DVD would be someone on an intermediate level if not for the difficulty of the workout, which I feel can be modified, but for the fact that the narration and poses are out of sync. Ideally one who is more familiar with the poses could more easily follow what Litsa is saying without having to rely on watching it as well.

To combat the narration issue, I simply studied the workout a couple times. (I only wish difficulties with my stamina could be overome so easily!)  I wanted to write this review for those that might be hesitant to purchase because many here have noted the issue with the narration.  I'm a beginner, and it was an easy fix for me. The end result is a great workout with plenty of room to grow guided by a soothing and skilled instuctor.",1248480000,,848,4.314465408805032

2350220,5,B000A26M1E,"This is an excellent hour-long routine with great flow and yet gentleness too. Nice combinations of movements and not at all boring. Excellent for winding down with. Great for intermediates, although pace yourself as there are no modifications. It is a thorough work out that completely stretches you out and calms the mind. I like to do it in the afternoons or weekend when I have time for a longer routine. It is a little new-agey in style, references to the heart etc., but not overly so. If you like power yoga, in the style of Shiva Rea, Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest etc you will probably enjoy this one too.",1235001600,2,607,4.527272727272727
2350221,5,B000A26M1E,"I love the asanas chosen in this dvd as well as the sequencing of the asanas.  Many other reviewers are correct that the cueing is not  synced well with what is on the screen.  I purchased this yoga a couple of years ago when I was newer to yoga and it didn't work well for me due to the cueing issue.  I recently pulled it back out and have found that it is not a problem at all for me.  I rarely look at the screen and just follow the verbal cues.

I highly recommend that you start the practice with the menu pick titled ""Breath"".  It only runs approximately 4 minutes and includes breath of fire and ujjayi breathing.  It is nice to start with this so that you don't forget to use the ujjayi breathing throughout the practice.  I even run through the breath portion twice sometimes before moving on to the asana practice portion of the DVD.

The asana practice is 1 hour in length which includes shavasana for approximately 5 minutes.  Lisa's voice is very nice.  When going through vinyasas she usually instructs you to do chataranga dandasana all the way to the floor and then into cobra, however you can do chataranga to upward facing dog if you prefer.  Depending upon how I am feeling some days I may hit the pause button to hold some of the poses longer, but usually not.  There is such a good variety of poses in this one hour practice.  I will be using this once or twice per week in addition to my own personal practice.

** EDITED -- I am coming back to add some comments.  I had not done this DVD for some time and pulled it out the other day.  I do not think that I will use this DVD again as it moves through the poses quicker than I like.  I enjoy a flowing vinyasa practice, but I like to move with my breath, which is much slower than the pace of this DVD.",1229040000,,1776,4.170588235294118

2350224,5,B000A26M1E,"I've tried several yoga DVDs  (all with good reviews on Amazon) and this one is the stand-out for me. The practice is not broken up into parts, so I don't get distracted or bored having to wait for intro music or long transitions, etc. The result is a challenging and continuous practice and I feel rewarded when I finish. The asanas are definitely intermediate and so you are required to modify on your own, if needed. Once you've done the practice a few times, you can focus on the audio instruction; the comments about the disconnect between audio and video demonstration of the asanas are accurate, but I haven't found a DVD practice this challenging that also keeps me engaged from start to finish, so it's ultimately not a bad trade-off. I highly recommend this!",1211673600,,768,4.688888888888889
2350225,5,B000A26M1E,"This is an excellent dvd for intermediate to advanced yogis.  I don't recommend this for a beginner per se, as the flow is fairly quick, so you need to know what the asanas are before you begin the dvd. I loved the music, and Litsa's voice is very soothing and beautiful to listen to during the session.  I found her inspiring! Thid dvd is challenging for me with a wide variety of asanas, which all move very flowing-like and quickly, so if you prefer to hold your asanas, you may wish to consider a different dvd. I could happily feel the burn during and after the class.  My only complaint (and someone else mentioned this as well) is that the voiceover wasn't always on time.  I would look up to watch Litsa and see that she was performing the pose ahead of the instruction.  Personally I like to hear the instruction, and then be able to watch her perform it, not the other way around.  That being said, I don't think it's a big deal, especially after viewing the dvd a couple of times. I really enjoy the different chapter selections, including an intro, a section on breath, the main flow, music flow (no audio voiceovers, simply music during the entire 60 minute session) and an interview and art gallery section, where you can view her artwork.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a challenging, beautifully rendered and inspiring class!",1209168000,3,1403,4.610441767068273
2350226,4,B000A26M1E,"Everyone wrote great reviews, to add with what I agree & disagree with:
The production values are well done except on the Main Flow which has her voice over & music... the voice over is so loud that you cannot hear the great music unless you want to disturb the neighbors. In the Music Flow which is the same thing w/music only, it's wonderful to hear the full rich sounds (but I still need voice direction).
I agree Litsa is very calming both in movement & in voice & the spiritual reminders were lovely. The flow is great as well as the large amount of different poses, though a little repetitive with warrior I series in the sun salutations. She does better with the warrior 2/side angle flow & beyond. I enjoy the backwards/reverse warriors, the bound poses, etc. that aren't on most yoga dvds.
This is definitely a fast-paced session. You go in/out within 1-2 breaths, which for me is enough to go into it & she's already going out since I take my time. I've done Rodney Yee's power yoga which I loved & Kabalah yoga which was holds it for 4-6 breaths is my perfect pace, the one minute holds bore me.
I did have trouble following her cuing since she goes so fast, she can only give basic body placement reminders & the English pose name. Since the voice over is WAY after what she is doing on screen, it's almost of no help to even turn your head to look. Many times I had to stop & rewind to see exactly how to bound my arms correctly which ruined the flow for me & not hearing the music also disappointed me & I didn't finish the dvd because of it.
This would be 5 stars if the cuing/timing & sound/music levels were fixed.

2350227,5,B000A26M1E,"This great yoga dvd lasts for more than one hour with constant flow from start to the end. If you like to hold for several breaths on each asana, this video is not for you. It is fast and vigorous. I choose some other yoga dvd to follow on days my balance is not so good, because I feel it needs great concentration. This vinyasa flow covers lots of poses, I especially love the twisted poses which releases the deep hurting muscle in my hip and low back. Dynamic, sweating serenity.",1197331200,4,483,4.318681318681318
2350228,4,B000A26M1E,"This is a good yoga dvd, but it could have been great.  The vinyasas/poses are great, sound is nice, it's a good workout, I like the way Litsa Kapantais takes you through the workout.  So what's the problem?  Well, the narration is out of sync with the workout.  It's okay at first, not too bad, but about halfway through the dvd, you look up and find that what's showing on your TV screen is about two poses ahead of where the narration actually is.  This is a bummer.  A few of the poses are different than what I'm used to, so it would be nice to glance up at my TV to see if what I'm doing looks right.

Otherwise, it's a pretty good yoga workout and maybe after doing it more than a few times, I'll get used to the synchronization.  Maybe this doesn't bother others.",1196985600,3,771,4.197278911564626
2350229,4,B000A26M1E,"The asanas span a variety of challenge levels, to intermediate.  They're all accessible, none is too advanced, and designed to touch every inch of you - inside and out.  (For guidance, examples of the most challenging are Dancer, Double Pigeon, both Bows and Warrior III.)

LK guides with a beautiful, peaceful and gently encouraging voice.  Her description of the poses is clear and she smoothly takes you through transitions.  The additional notes she gives regarding minor adjustments you can make while in the pose to lengthen, strengthen and align can be very helpful.

However, the decision to have the verbal cuing slightly behind the movement on screen feels wrong.  It's just too far behind and therefore a little disconcerting - as if you're trying to catch up.  If you do like to glance at the screen throughout practice, you'll sometimes feel that you are in two places at once rather than focused and in the present.

Visually simple, with a plain off-white background and LK alone on a raised circular platform and mat surrounded by tea-candles.  The music is a rhythmic coalition of sounds, usually gentle, occasionally a little surging, of bells and drums.  Sound clarity is superb.

This is a serene, beautiful and fairly full spectrum beginner/intermediate lesson.  It incorporates a wide variety of breathing, stretching, strengthening and balancing poses, made different by the unusual transitions and occasional use of breath of fire.",1196467200,3,1455,5.166666666666667
2350230,5,B000A26M1E,"This is an awesome practice! It is an intermediate, original, vigorous, creative and yet calming power yoga flow. I love it! Her choreography has unique flows which you don't come across much that make for a refreshing practice. Also, I always love when theres a good variety of asanas with chatarungas interspersed to give a good upper body workout to get the blood pumping. She does not dissapoint, this will definitely challenge your legs and upper body. However, she lightens it up a bit by not putting a vinyasa (chatarunga, updog, downdog) between sides, just before and after--but if I want to put it up a notch I just add it in. Also, most of her vinyasa's actually go to cobra but I just modify it to updog and add an extra pushup in there instead which is very easy to do (nothing is carved in stone). She includes alot of asana variety for both strength and stretch making it fun and interesting. This is a very dynamic well rounded practice! She does an excellent job of the voice over cueing, her voice is soothing and calming with excellent, intuitive direction that's just enough to keep you focused without slowing the wonderful flow. Amazing! She almost reminded me of Shiva that way--Shiva's got one of the best voice over cueing around! The only drawback I see with her cueing is that sometimes it lags behind the movement which is too bad because everything else about this practice is just so exceptional, I just wish they could have corrected this. Still it does not demerit a star from my rating.

The production and setting is very professionally done. It's in a studio on a stylized platform with votive type candles around the platform giving a soothing, calm touch (somehow doesn't come across as cheap or kichy). The camera work is excellent. The video has a very calming, soothing, dynamic feel to it.

This is an amazing practice and highly recommended to all you Shiva, Bryan, Baron, Eoin, Mark, power, vinyasa yoga lovers out there!!",1193356800,3,1965,4.725947521865889
2350231,5,B000A26M1E,"I travel quite a bit for work and use workout DVDs when I'm on the road. I have everything from the Firm (the cheesy 80's version to present), Tae Bo, AbJam, Kathy Smith, Yoga Booty Ballet, etc. in my Liabrary.(My first home work-out was actually Jane Fonda's LP!) I started Bikram Yoga over a year ago and became hooked. From there I moved into Power and Vinyasa Flow and this is what I love the most. As a result I started collecting Yoga DVDs-Sean Corn, Shiva Rae, Rodney Yea, Gurmukh's Kundalini, and several from the Gaia series. My absolute favorite among them all is ""Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow"". It's a great workout and perfect series for home or hotel-you will not be disapointed! Disclaimer, I purchased the DVD around May of 2006 having no idea who Litsa was. As it turns out, she lives in the same town as I do and I've had the pleasure of taking her class in person. She's a wonderful instructor and is very inspiring to practice with. If you're looking for a great go-to practice when you can't get to class, I really encourage you to try this one, you won't be disappointed!",1184976000,9,1098,4.467661691542289

The main yoga flow is put together well. You start by warming up, and the flow keeps it moving throughout; although newbies might want to first watch her routine before doing it. There are 2 or 3 poses where she does the Breath of Fire! That was my first and it was quite stimulating and different. Nice touch. Near the end, she does a cool-down meditation. The total flow lasts about 55-60 minutes.

In addition, there is some neat artwork done by Litsa; she's also an artist. I love female artists. :) I recommend this for any yoga students and teachers so that they know what a great yoga flow looks like.",1173484800,,776,4.308219178082192
2350233,4,B000A26M1E,"Yoga-Topia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow is an ADVANCED-BEGINNER to INTERMEDIATE level yoga DVD, with nice, subtle background music. The practice requires some STRENGTH and ENDURANCE to complete the moves. Some poses include eagle, pigeon, wheel, extended side angle, side plank, plow...but no headstands or more advanced moves.  There is one instructor in a very neutral inside studio, with a voice-over narrative for direction.  The one hour continual vinyasa flow of Yogatopia is DYNAMIC AND VIGOROUS, helping to create lean, strong muscles and increased flexibility.

The DVD menu includes the choice of two options of practice... one with a narrator's voice, plus background music and the second is the same practice with no voice instruction, only the music. The DVD menu also includes the option of viewing a brief teaching on breathing, explaining the rhythmic breathing patterns and the breath of fire, which is done several times during the practice.  There is also an option to see an interview with the instructor, Litsa Kapantais.

The instructor executes the CREATIVE AND PURPOSEFUL moves in the Yinyasa Flow with grace and artistry.  Directional instruction is done well, with additional information on occasion as to the purpose of some moves.  I also appreciate the instruction to do a move ""to your degree"", taking into consideration the different levels and abilities of those participating (although no alternative moves are shown).

OK...Here's my main negative to the DVD... I found a problem with the TIMING of the voice-overs. (Maybe this will not concern or bother you at all).  Personally, I like instruction to be given slightly BEFORE a move is done, so that if the practitioner needs to look up at the screen for visual help, he/she can view the move AS the instructor is actually DOING it.  MANY TIMES, I noticed that the instructor DID THE MOVE and the VOICE INSTRUCTION was heard at the same time... or WAY too many times, INSTRUCTION came AFTER the move was completed.... so the practitioner 'at home' could not visually SEE how the move was accomplished, if needing to look up quickly at the screen for visual assistance. When you are first starting this practice take into consideration that before you know the moves well, you may need to be patient with yourself, stopping and then re-starting the DVD a few times if needed.  Even though I did find that little ""glitch"" with the TIMING of the voice over, I still found the practice beneficial, creative and very enjoyable.....it's an ENERGETIC, balanced CONTINUAL Flow with no breaks in the practice.",1154649600,28,2582,5.080378250591017

It is a challenging vinyasa yoga practice that flows really well from one pose to another but this is not the same old boring power yoga routine , it is actually unique with poses I have not seen on other yoga tapes, like doing crunches in a supine eagle pose plus a lot of great transitions from one pose to another, even the sun salutations are a little bit different. This is definitely not for beginners , it's quite fast and there are poses like crow , side plank, shoulder stand and plow and there are no modifications, but there is no super advanced stuff. There is also a bonus pranayama section and an option to do the workout with no instruction.

If you like Shiva Rea's type of yoga you will probably like this one too. Highly recommended and worth the price.",1150675200,21,814,4.355263157894737

There are some poses that I have never seen anywhere else such as doing crunches while your legs and arms are in eagle pose.  Although I don't have the shoulder flexibility to cross my arms in eagle pose it is definitely something I am working towards.  This video is just the way I like it, not a whole lot of distractions in the background for fluff.  I only have two small criticisms as far as this video is concerned.  One is the filming.  There are a few times when Ms. Kapantais is doing a folding pose, and although she tells you what you should be doing, there is no way to tell because the camera isn't showing how to do it, and there are times when the camera zooms in and then zooms out for no apparent reason although that is done very rarely.  Two-I could have done without the candles around the elevated mat.  I'm guessing that Ms. Kapantais was trying to set the mood, but there was really no need for it.  If you can live with these two small distractions then I strongly suggest this video to anybody who wants to improve their strength and flexibility.",1148256000,9,1170,4.2727272727272725
2350236,5,B000A26M1E,"I am so happy that I bought this video.  It is a beautiful practice.  I couldn't help smiling after I finished it.  I felt like I had just fallen in love for the first hour after I had finished it.

You go through a very very wide variety of poses, which I am not going to begin to list. The best part is that you flow through them all, without explanatory breaks.  This can also make it kind of confusing, because some of the poses were unfamiliar.  But after doing the practice a few times, I am sure it will be much easier.

There is a breathing section in the beginning.  (This is not part of the 60 minute workout.) There is also a warm up.  The teacher is wonderful - soft spoken and soothing.

This is an intermediate workout.  I wouldn't say that this is the most challenging workout in terms of strength, but you need strength to do it.  This practice definitely challenges balance, endurance, and flexibility.  It made me nice and sweaty.  More importantly, it just made me feel ridiculously good, and I would recommend it to you whole-heartedly.

Edit: I did this workout another time watching form carefully, and it became even more challenging.  I rescind what I said about not challenging strength that much - it challenges your legs and requires core strength to do it all gracefully. (Arm strength challenged through sun salutes mainly, and there aren't too many). Also, it is challenging aerobically, but not too fast (it is challenging because it doesn't really have resting poses - it is all active poses). And I still felt absolutely wonderful at the end - it is just a beautiful, graceful practice.

Also, here are some of the poses:  warrior series, triangle series, sun salutation A (and B?), crow, dancer, pigeon (single and double leg), half moon... more and more",1144454400,41,1788,4.622222222222222

Litsa Kapantais is such a graceful and inspiring teacher, and this is a practice that leaves me feeling stronger in mind and body.  This DVD appeals to a more intermediate practitioner since it is a challenging sequence of poses and there is just enough explanatory dialogue but not too much.

Then it evolves into a unique Salutation B (unique because rather than going from DD to WI to vinyasa it does three warrior variations).  After these salutations I'm already feeling very fluid and energized.  Then you go through a couple of standing series with reverse warrior, extended angle, and triangle.  The poses themselves overall are not very unique, but I love the sequencing and flow.  A few poses you will see (aside from the ones mentioned above and in no particular order) are dancer, crow, eagle, bridge, camel, side plank, reverse plank (which I love and rarely see in yoga DVDs), reverse triangle, and pyramid.
Something that is unique is that she incorporates fire breathing in a few of the poses.  Also this video has one of the most soothing shavasanas I've found.  She doesn't talk the whole way through it, and the music is perfect.  Also, unlike most DVDs, she doesn't just leave you lying there but gently pulls you back.
One drawback is that, like other reviewers have said, the voiceovers are WAY off.  The first few times I followed the DVD it was very frustrating, but once I got used to the practice it didn't bother me at all because I wasn't looking at the screen anyway.",1309305600,,1494,4.744186046511628
8072329,5,B000A26M1E,"This is a good solid flow yoga workout. Sometimes flow yoga dvd teachers spend far too much time explaining, which is great for the first time you watch the dvd but then this becomes a hinderence with later viewings. Fortunately, this is not the case here. The routine flows at a nice rate. The queing is fine and the transitions between poses are logical. Good flow workout. Not up there with Deb Dobbin and Bryan Kest (Sweat, tone etc) but close.",1282176000,,448,4.54320987654321
