4712872,4,B005JJSG3U,"Michael Rubino, DVD Verdict --Queensrche: Mindcrime at the Moore is like a metalhead version of Les Miserables on PBS. This double-album concert is presented on stage with actors, choreography, a multi-tiered set, and video footage. It's bombastic, over the top, cheesy, and also kind of awesome.

Queensrche is no stranger to concert theatrics. After releasing the first Operation: Mindcrime in the '80s, they toured with a similar setup, performing the album in its entirety alongside animated sequences and staging with singer Pamela Moore as Sister Mary. Mindcrime at the Moore is a more epic endeavor. After a brief animated prelude, the band takes the stage alongside the Seattle Seahawks's drum line. It's a killer way to make an entrance as they launch into ""Anarchy-X"" and ""Revolution Calling."" From that point on, the band never stops to chat or take a break. Lead singer Geoff Tate marches from one song to the next, changing costumes, climbing around the set, and interacting with the various actors.

As far as concert movies go, Queensrche: Mindcrime at the Moore (Blu-ray) is a little underwhelming considering the high-level production happening on stage. The camera work is decent, but some of the acting could have been framed better. What's more troubling, however, is the use of post-production typography. Like some weird karaoke feature, footage for a couple of the songs features gigantic, pixilated, lyrics overlaid on the screen. Maybe that works on the Jumbotron at the concert, but not in a high-def Blu-ray video. Otherwise, the video quality is great; the edges are crisp and the colors are vibrant in 1080i.

The Blu-ray's sound is a mixed bag. The DTS HD Master track and the Dolby 5.1 Surround are loud and clear, but the drumming occasionally gets lost in the mix. When the Seattle Seahawks march on at the beginning and end of the first act, I expected to be blown away--instead, the drumming just blends in with the rest of the band. The various Dr. X interludes and sound effects take full advantage of the rear speakers, and the rest of the instruments are mixed well through all of the channels. It doesn't sound bad, but they could have done a little more with the mix.

The disc also features a decent tour documentary, footage from Ronnie James Dio giving a cameo performance of ""The Chase"" at a staging of the concert in L.A., and clips from Queensrche's ""Rock & Ride"" fundraiser from VH1.

4712873,4,B005JJSG3U,"Operation mindcrime is a classic album. I own the CD of mindcrime I & II as well as Queensryche - Operation Livecrime (1991) on DVD. I just purchased at the Moore. Here's a quick breakdown.

Visually: Mindcrime at the Moore LOOKS great. It is visually far superior to Livecrime. Livecrime suffers from the seizure inducing montage editing that was popular at the time. Both fair well but EDGE Moore.

Music: Livecrime is much more dynamic in the sound realm. There is a much better energy. Moore has the advantage of being on blu-ray and mixed in dolby 5.1 (you don't do heavy metal in Dubly ... sorry, couldn't resist)
Moore also packs 2 albums worth of music on one disk. Mindcrime I&II are performed. EDGE - Even

Miscellaneous: If you are only buying 1 disk here's what to consider. Livecrime has the band in their prime with the original lineup. Moore has more material and benefits from technology. There is also an extra of Ronnie James Dio singing the Dr. X part in mindcrime II. HOWEVER, it is only an extra and the sound is terrible compared to either feature. This was the biggest disappointment about Moore for me. Couldn't they have gotten Dio into the feature ... really.

Conclusions: I bought both. If you are an older fan, like me, I prefer the Livecrime disk. If you like the newer material and are a technogeek, Moore will be more to your liking. Either way it's classic music well executed.",1398816000,7,1410,4.628
4712874,5,B005JJSG3U,"Operation Mind crime is in my top 5 or so of music CD's.  This is the only Blu-Ray recording of this.

It is not perfect, but neither are you or I.

GET THIS if you are a fan, period.",1395446400,,183,3.641025641025641
4712875,4,B005JJSG3U,"seeing them perform this album live defintly gives you more insight on the story rather than just hearing it, the sound quality and picture are superb. and the costume and props totaly made this one of the best performances ever. making it worth the money to buy this on blue ray over dvd.",1353628800,,289,4.471698113207547
4712876,1,B005JJSG3U,"When i buy DVD's i mainly care about the performance of the musicians, i care about watching them play the guitars, the drums, etc. I just hate this DVD because everything is focused around Tate's cheesy acting. I couldn't really enjoy the concert cause i felt very annoyed about watching him, like i really couldn't stare at him.

So yeah, if you care more about the performance, this Blu Ray is not worth the money.",1348444800,6,417,4.56
4712877,4,B005JJSG3U,"Hello everybody.

This blu ray bring to us a great hard rock show; all the musicians do their jobs very well and Geoff Tate is amazing, a great singer and actor. The image and sound are good. Unfortunately the song ""the chase"" didn't have Dio alive.",1341273600,,249,4.413043478260869
4712878,4,B005JJSG3U,"Mindcrime At The Moore is a live release by the progressive metal band Queensrche, recorded in the Moore Theatre in Seattle and originally released in 2007. It has been released on CD, DVD and Blu-Ray.

In terms of set list, the band performs the entire of their classic 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and then its heavier 2006 sequel, back to back and in their original running-orders. There is also a two-song encore of `Walk In The Shadows' and `Jet City Woman,' from Rage For Order and Empire respectively, resulting in a total of 44 songs, lasting two hours and twenty nine minutes.

The performance as you may imagine is big and theatric, with lots of additional personnel on stage acting around the band. There are set pieces, props, costume changes for singer Geoff Tate and guest vocalist Pamela Moore, video screens and elaborate lighting, all helping to drive the narrative of the story that is told in the two concept albums.

The camera work, picture quality, direction and editing of the actual live performance is absolutely top-notch and when the screen is showing the band actually playing live this is a truly fine looking concert recording.

There is a lot of additional film footage and text that comes up on the screen augmenting the concert footage however, and because the theatrical performance was played out in front of aforementioned video screens much of the content from them is often shown superimposed over the live performance, or sometimes shown instead of the concert footage all together. For most people this will help you get into it even more but if you usually don't like it when concert DVDs do this sort of thing then you may really hate this particular release, as the phenomenon is much, much more prominent here than usual.

Another potential problem is that during the first few tracks the audio seems to be ever so slightly out of synch with the visuals, however this is rectified by the time the title track of the first album is over.  These two issues aside, the main feature is very good, especially once Geoff's voice has warmed up and he can really lay into the material and get closer to the original performance.

In addition to the main feature, there is a brief twenty three minute tour documentary and a two minute feature about a charity motorcycle ride called `Rock and Ride'.  The most interesting bonus feature however is an alternative version of `The Chase' where Ronnie James Dio joins the band live, as opposed to in a pre-recorded video like in the main concert.

Overall, if you have issues with screen time being taken up by non-concert footage or are massively put-off by synching issues then it may not be the right release for you, but otherwise this is a very entertaining and interesting release that is definitely worth checking out.",1333152000,4,2808,4.809128630705394
4712879,1,B005JJSG3U,"I was a huge Queensryche fan, until i saw this...

To be honest, they are lip syncing and not playing... they are faking it in this..

A cheesy performance.. very cheesy....

dont wast your time on this one, go for real concert footage...

very disppointed queensryche fan",1329436800,,272,4.723404255319149
4712880,2,B005JJSG3U,"Overdone.  Overwrought, overacted, overblown, over the hill.  I am a lifetime fan of Queensryche, and regard Mindcrime as the best concept rock album of all time, and the LIVE:crime DVD to be one of the best live recordings of any band.

But this aint it.  There are times when Geoff Tate's acting goes into Shatner territory, complete with the big gut and the over-wrenching facial expressions.  I don't think, after De Garmo left, there was anyone left in the band to say no to him. He's become Queensryche's own version of George Lucas.  This comes off as a real ego trip for Tate, like it's the Tate-and-Moore Theater Hour (Pamela Moore, Sister Mary), and the rest of the band is part of the production crew.  They try to explain Sister Mary's exact method of death, and it came off totally absurd.  It was Queensryche's ""Greedo shot first"" moment.  Thanks.  The mystery surrounding her death was much better.  They added songs, changed others so radically it was difficult to tell what they were doing. Tate WHISTLES during ""Waiting for 22 . . . ""  All in all the additions muddy up the story, making an otherwise taut and engaging story, with a few mysteries left unanswered, to a performance of self-indulgence.

This is just part I.  Mindcrime part II, written without De Garmo, in my opinion is a disaster in comparison with it's predecessor.  It is like Paul McCartney trying to write another Sgt. Pepper by himself.  It is confused, wandering, and not nearly as well written, lyrically.

The DVD of LIVE: crime is still the best recorded performance of Operation:Mindcrime, IMO.",1322870400,16,1589,4.804428044280443
4712881,3,B005JJSG3U,"I'm not going to go into a silly long review about a product that is excellent. A blu ray concert that is fantastic for all Queensryche fans captures Operation Mindcrime I & II in its entirety with crystal clear images and fantastic theaterical performances by Geoff Tate, the band & the actors portraying there mindcrime parts. Truly a progressive metal rock opera! My only problem is when you get to the song the Chase from Mindcrime II. Its all on screen with no live performance by Tate or Dio. The infamous late Ronnie James Dio makes his only public appearance as Dr. X at one of these 3 tapings and the only way to watch it is in the bonus features. Well, when you get to this so called bonus its a grainy bunk version from one camera angle with crappy sound. I have a much better version posted to my Facebook page with multiple camera angles and fantastic sound and I got it off of Youtube! How is that possible? I just think why would the producers, dvd to bluray transferers and the band let this happen!

It is truly not the way to honor a man who wrote the metal handbook and has since then passed away. So, in short, thanks for the great bluray concert, but what a slap in the face to the late DIO and fans. Its a very big deal to get DIO on stage to perform a great song in concert as a special treat, so I wish I had it on bluray in a serious format rather than having to watch it on Youtube! Im giving 3 stars. I removed one for no Dio perfomance, and one more for the bunky bonus feature perfomance with Dio. One of the main reasons I bought this was because of the Dio perfomance and I was robbed, but a special thanks to Youtube, they gave me what I wanted. FIX THIS!!",1321401600,3,1688,4.177914110429448
4712882,5,B005JJSG3U,"I'm blown away by this live ""Mindcrime"" concert! I know that most of the acting is really hammed up, but it's a rock band! Pink Floyd hammed it up when they released ""The Wall"" and they did it to a point that at the end of their show, the wall was built in front of their band and they'd play the last few songs where you couldn't see them! Geoff Tate hasn't lost his vocal range (like Axl Rose), and he doesn't mind showing it off in dramatic fashion!  I'm very pleased with this presentation and even though the first half of this concert is much different than when they did ""Video: Mindcrime"" back in the 80's, it's still a wonderful concert with heartfelt changes to some of the songs that work very well!
The sound quality on my stereo great! I have it going through a 7.2 surround sound and using a PS3 to watch it on. Yes, some of the bass guitar and drums have a feedback sound in some of the songs, but I've seen so many live concerts, that I know it sounds like that in person... so I can tweak that out in my amp...
