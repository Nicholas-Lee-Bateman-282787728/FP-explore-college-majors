8313060,3,B001JL96O0,"This felt like a cookie-cutter DVD. I did think the workout costumes were cute. But the outfit Rania is wearing on the cover is not the one she's wearing in the performance. And the one she's wearing for the performance is the same as the one she wears in her other DVD, Belly Abs, which I think makes this DVD feel as if it were put out on the fly. However, there are some cute moves in the combinations, some of which seemed to have a salsa flavor.

Here is my main complaint: Rania needs to focus more on safety. At one point in the video she says something like, ""You may be hurting now, but you'll thank me some day."" That really shouldn't be true of bellydancing. I think Rania should cover the need to approach exercise moderately. You should never strain or stress yourself when bellydancing. If you push yourself too fast and too far you might injure yourself. Certainly there were a lot of lunges in the warm-up that could indeed cause someone to suffer pain if they were overdone, but a responsible instructor will warn her students to only do what they feel comfortable doing. You should gradually work up to doing more at first. As other instructors say, ""Listen to your body.""

I think Leila did a much better job explaining safety in her DVD, Belly Dance for Beginners. Even though I think Rania's style of instructing is more professional than Leila's, I think Rania should be more aware of the need to look out for her students' safety.

But if you are already aware of the fact that you don't have to follow everything an instructor says but should take it slowly and learn at your own pace, you could enjoy this DVD.",1329782400,,1635,4.461538461538462
8313061,3,B001JL96O0,"First the actual workout of this DVD is only about 36 minutes long not 47 mins. as labeled on the package. The warmup lasts for about 15 minutes plus there's about a 3 min. cooldown. So I had how much time left to do what? Not much I found. There were a few moves that did target the gluts, but I found that most of the moves did not do much for the gluts like 'pelvic locks' for example.  There was potential in the last combo which involved a shimmy on the toes while traveling a few steps at an angle.

I'm curious as to why we were instructed to do a hip drop by 'moving our knees up and down' instead of by powering the drops with the gluts. This is called 'belly booty' after all! I much prefer the two 'legs and butt' segments Rania has on her 'Bellydance Personal Trainer' dvd. Also Suhaila has a great bellydance buns workout dvd which is a little intermediate.

What I did like about this DVD is that Rania doesn't do a voiceover which made her seem much more relaxed than in her early dvds. However there were a few mistakes made in Belly Booty that probably wouldn't have been made if it included a voiceover. I'll use this dvd sometimes as a warmup or cooldown for more specific glut workouts.",1258588800,7,1206,4.234782608695652
