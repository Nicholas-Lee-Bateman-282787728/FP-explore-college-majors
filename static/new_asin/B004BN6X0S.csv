4319822,5,B004BN6X0S,This is an excellent workout that is definitely advanced but you can start out no matter what level you are on and work your way up.  Lots of squats & I love the core workout on this video too!!  Definitely recommend this video!!,1343952000,2,229,4.3023255813953485
4319823,3,B004BN6X0S,"This appeared to be a good workout with the kettlebells. I can't be too sure since I have purchased a total of 3 DVDs and all had to be returned as being defective. I would get about 1/3 of the way through and then the DVD would freeze up on me. I have purchased all 3 from different vendors in case it was a defective batch, all seemed to have micro scratches on the disk (brand new) and one of them was not in the case very well.

This is not a vendor's/dealer/seller problem but the publisher or people who put the DVD together.

What I was able to discover is that these exercises use a lot of leg. Even just going through 1/3 of the entire routine made my legs very very sore, especially my hamstrings. Be prepared for a lot of leg exercises.

The introduction does go a little fast but thankfully all you have to do is click on rewind or go to menu and go through again until you have it. It should be done a little slower and giving all information so not to cause injury. Also good idea, make sure footwear is not just closed toe but also very strong at the toe to protect. During some of the exercises, I dropped the kettlebell and nearly had it land on my feet. This can become a little more problamatic if the exercises become faster later in the DVD.",1342828800,2,1262,4.163934426229508
4319824,5,B004BN6X0S,I love Katami's instruction style. He is easy to follow and the workout is challenging. It was so much fun I was done before I knew I had even begun. I love Kettlebells and his combo's are very fluid. Very sore after doing this one,1317772800,4,231,4.155555555555556
4319825,5,B004BN6X0S,"Paul Katami is a very skilled fitness instructor, I have several of his more recent videos, and he gives precise, step by step direction, and repeats sequences enough that you can develop your form and catch on quickly. He is excellent with the kettlebell workouts and with his 4x4 Bootcamp. Very good and effective workout.",1310342400,7,324,4.909090909090909
4319826,5,B004BN6X0S,"I really like this workout and the instructor.  Paul does a great job breaking down each move during the clinic.  During the workout itself, he gives a quick intro before each combo and then shows an example.  I am an Int-Adv exerciser and I go as heavy as I possibly can with strict attention to my form.  This means that while Paul is doing his quick intro transitioning from combo to combo, I am grabbing some air, wiping the sweat off my hands and recovering quickly for the next round.  Since I am working at a super intensity, I do not find the pauses in Paul's intros a problem at all.

There are 2 additional exercisers with Paul.  One demonstrates advanced moves and one person demonstrates the easier method for a particular movement.  I love the countdown (60 seconds or 30 second intervals).  I think the background music is sort of bland but the music isn't really driving the workout so I will probably end up playing my own music in the background and drowing out the music from the DVD.

The moves are not complicated and the combo moves work well together. I did the Clinic 3x.  Usually I don't have the patience for ""previewing"" workouts or completing introductory type sessions but I truly enjoyed the clinic and got a nice sweat worked up especially practicing swings.  Each time I did the clinic I figured out where I might be able to go heavy and where I would need to quickly switch to another weight.  The workout itself goes by fast.  At the end of the workout there are several sets of Oblique bell swings (30 seconds one side then the other) then a 2nd set 30 seconds to the right 30 second swing front and 30 second to the left) and I'm glad we can squeeze in some ab work here in the main workout because sometimes I can't get to the full abdominal routine when I am pressed for time.  The ab workout is also intense but doable and I don't dread it.

I find Paul's style to be friendly, knowledgeable, engaging without being annoying.  The setting is plain and looks like a gym.  The quality of the picture and audio is excellent.  The DVD is chaptered:  Clinic, Workout, Abs.  I look forward to this workout and ordered the Drills workout also.",1308528000,16,2174,4.453164556962025
4319827,4,B004BN6X0S,"I tried this a few times now.  It's a decent workout.  I use a 10lb kettlebell and find the workout to be moderate.  What I don't like is that he spends too much time explaining a move (that's fine in the ""clinic"" section, not good in the ""kombo"" section), and this time allows my heart rate to drop.  I know I could fast forward, but that gets annoying.  There are a few spots ont he dvd where the sound gets really low and you can hardly hear what is being said.  There's also one spot where the editing was poor and you can see they made a mistake as they didn't switch sides when Paul said to.  Minor issues, but that's why I didn't give it a 5.",1302134400,10,649,4.0234375
4319828,5,B004BN6X0S,"I like the fact that the instructor emphasizes form and provides a ""clinic"" to teach how to do each exercise properly.  There are no dance-y moves; the instructor demonstrates the exercise, a clock is set with 30 to 90 seconds (depending on the exercise), and the exercise is performed as many times as possible during the time limit.  A lighter kettlebell is used (I used a 7 pound, and it looked like the people in the video were using 10 pound kettlebells), and I got a good cardio workout.  Most of the exercises are great for thighs, glutes, and core--I would use caution using this video if you have back issues.",1295222400,38,618,4.54954954954955
4319829,5,B004BN6X0S,"I have Paul's Kombos and Drills.  Both are excellent workouts with a Kettlebell.  It's tough.  I've been using Kettlebells for about a year and thought I was tough...until I got these 2 DVDs!  Whoa!  What I like best is he uses a timer on each exercise.  30 seconds or 60 seconds seems to go really fast so it gives you confidence. (Only 30 seconds? Yeah, I can do that)  He is well versed in what he teaches.  The clinic is good for those just starting out.  Practical, fun, tough, challenging...he leaves nothing out!  I highly recommend this video as well as Drills.",1294876800,20,569,4.490196078431373
4319830,5,B004BN6X0S,Excellent exercise video - not for beginners.  Paul Katami takes the user through rigorous but doable kettlebell combo exercises.  He is an excellent teacher.,1386374400,,158,5.541666666666667
4319831,5,B004BN6X0S,"I've taken classes with a certified kettlebell instructor at the gym and wanted a workout to do at home.  I wasn't sure if the Kettlebell Kombos or the Kettlebell Drills would be the best place to start, but I chose the Kombos figuring I could work my way up if they were too difficult.  This was the right choice and thus far I've been extremely happy with the workout and with Paul's style of instruction.  No doubt the moves are advanced, but take your time with it and use a lower weight bell (I use a 10 lb for most of the exercises and a 15lb for swings and squats) until you feel really good about your form and pace!",1382918400,,624,4.183333333333334
4319832,5,B004BN6X0S,Very happy with the video.  This is a great way to intorduce yourself to the KettleBell.  The clinic is great way to learn the moves and is a workout in itself.,1381708800,,160,4.129032258064516
4319833,5,B004BN6X0S,"I decided to review this DVD after over a year of owning it because I am surprised there aren't a lot more reviews and it is such a great workout!  It is one of my favorites.  Paul Katami does a great job explaining how to do the moves and combinations.  I also have Lauren Brooks Kettlebell workout video and I can use heavier weights with hers because she does reps.  With the combos, you need to explode and snap into position and I find I have to go down a little in weight to keep my form in some cases, but it is always a good workout and when I haven't done it in awhile I am sore the next day, as I should be!  Paul gives options for a lot of the moves so if you are beginning you can keep it simpler and if you want a harder workout you can do option 2 or option 3.  He also has a core workout section that is good because it is different than others, although it is a shorter workout.  I tend to do this workout more than the others I own.  I like Paul's style and technique and will be buying more of his videos.",1377043200,2,1023,3.9082125603864735
4319834,5,B004BN6X0S,"I am 52 years old & have worked out my entire adult life. It has gotten harder to stay in shape sinceI hit 45, this really works. Fun & not boring at all. I really like the way paul breaks it down into short segments. Really recommend this video.",1375401600,,246,4.040816326530612
4319835,3,B004BN6X0S,The workout itself is just OK as he spends too long actually explaining what you will be doing.  WHen I do a workout I want to be moving the whole time so I get the most out of my time.,1370822400,,185,3.625
4319836,5,B004BN6X0S,No one's better when it comes to kettlebell workouts! He's inventive and easy on the eyes. I own all of his dvds and wish he'd hurry up and make more!,1364774400,,150,4.033333333333333
4319837,5,B004BN6X0S,"I was looking for a decent kettlebell DVD to add some variety to my exercise routine, and I am glad I picked this one. I am new to kettlebells, so the optional tutorial at the beginning was very helpful. That alone got your blood pumping. The actual workout flows nicely and keeps your mind busy since you need to pay attention to what is going on. I will admit that I am ""directionally challenged"" so I did have to pause a few times and figure out what foot was going out, and which arm was raising up. But I am sure as I become more comfortable with the routine, I will get better. And it's not so confusing that you get frustrated and want to quit. My hamstrings and obliques were sore the next day - which was a pleasant surprise since my legs are used to the pounding they get from Insanity and Asylum. Paul is a great instructor - he motivates you without any distracting banter. I will definitely be buying more of his videos. One thing to mention...it would be helpful to wear gloves or a wrist strap, since there are times when the kettlebell is coming back onto your wrist. My wrist bone started to get sore by the end, so I went out and bought some wrist straps at Walmart for $5. I think that will help.",1364169600,,1215,4.241379310344827
4319838,5,B004BN6X0S,"I love this guy. Both my husband and I get a good sweat going. He's easy to follow and
there is not a lot of jumping or crazy moves. Just weights and routines with the kettlebell.
Exactly what I paid for; oh, and we can do it in the 30 min. before we get ready for work.
I hate long routines. This runs just a bit over 30 min. start to finish.",1362528000,,343,3.7777777777777777
4319839,5,B004BN6X0S,"I have been doing Kettlebell for awhile now. I was using a beginners video and was ready to take it to the next level.  This video was exactly what I needed. Intense work out, challenging, new moves for me, and it has helped me define my muscle tone. Highly recommended.",1344038400,3,270,4.4

8422045,5,B004BN6X0S,This kettlebell workout is awesome. it is easy to follow along with and is super motivating. he is one of the best kettlebell instructors that I have seen. I always enjoy his workouts and I see results. I can feel it the next day which means it was a challenge. Love it. Would recommend.,1481846400,,287,4.333333333333333
8422046,5,B004BN6X0S,DVD includes what Katami calls a clinic.  shows you how to properly use the kettlebell.  workouts are just that - a workout.  you'll feel like you accomplished something when done.  even if you only go through half of it,1454457600,,220,4.564102564102564
8422047,3,B004BN6X0S,Not as good as his Drills workout.  He tries to do too many fancy moves and it's confusing; I'm afraid I'd hurt myself!,1421625600,3,119,4.173913043478261
8422048,5,B004BN6X0S,"Great workouts, I have 3 of Paul Katami DVD's, great for beginners and advance workouts!!!!!!!",1420502400,,94,5.333333333333333
8422049,4,B004BN6X0S,"Definitely a good kettlebell series! I enjoyed the clinics as they helped with form. I had to stop doing these because of a knee injury but I still incorporate some of the upper body work in my own personal routine. I must say that Paul had me cracking up during some of workout and also at his obvious flirting with Toby.  He barely paid attention to the girl(low intensity) in the video. For that, the DVDs get 4 stars",1413244800,,420,4.3164556962025316
8422050,5,B004BN6X0S,The clinic itself is a good workout.  During the Kombos section he shows you how to modify it to your ability level.  You know you've gotten a good workout when you are done with this!,1404518400,,184,4.228571428571429
8422051,3,B004BN6X0S,"Too much choreography for me.  Personal preference though, but thought I'd save someone else who dislikes heavily choreographed routines from wasting their money.  I won't do zumba, aerobics, etc due to having to follow all the moves.  Lots to follow on this dvd.  Well taught, calls out the moves as your are doing them, really well done overall, but just not my cup of tea.  Plus I get a much better sweat going on some shorter length workouts.  I'm so busy trying to following the movement combinations, I feel like my form suffers and I can't see being able to go up in weight.  Not for me.  I love Lauren Brooks, Sarah Lurie and Anthony DiLuglio--great workouts--great sweat--and no choreography to follow.",1396224000,8,711,4.770491803278689
8422052,5,B004BN6X0S,"So far I am loving this workout tape, it puts me through a pretty damn good workout. I love it.",1389484800,,95,3.8
8422053,3,B004BN6X0S,"Paul is a great instructor. He does timed sets so you know how long you have to endure the pain or you can push to do as many reps as possible. Some moves I have not seen, and interesting combos. The close up camera work is shakey and annoying, NOT artistic.",1386806400,,258,4.078431372549019
