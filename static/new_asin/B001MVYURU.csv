3701481,4,B001MVYURU,Red Sands is a better than average video. Some very interesting characters and a rather unpredictable ending.,1240704000,,109,5.470588235294118
3701482,4,B001MVYURU,Great thriller.  I especially like the fact that the script is based on a current situation.  Not many movies have the guts to do something like that.  Really tense suspense from start to finish.,1235779200,,195,4.676470588235294
3701483,4,B001MVYURU,"I was tense through the last two thirds of this movie. Not the sort of over the top bloodbath that many expect from modern ""horror"" movies, but  Red Sands has plenty of creepy scenes and is generally well crafted. Best of its kind I've seen in a while.",1235606400,,252,4.25
3701484,1,B001MVYURU,Just watched this movie and sadly wasted my time thinking that it might turn out to be a three star.  Tried to enjoy but halfway thru I gave it a two star and by the end it was truly a one star in my book.  This movie never really gets off the ground and will insult your intellegence to think a seargent would actually talk to his troops as if they were basic training morons.  Filmed almost entirely in a very vagely lit pueblo hut with 3 or 4 rooms it is hard to see anything but flashes of characters.  Steer clear of this one if your looking for a good movie to watch.  Basically---(to be nice)  Stinks!,1235433600,2,608,4.110169491525424
3701495,3,B001MVYURU,Wasn't what I expexcted. Needs a better plot. Special effects weren't bad though. May be if our real service members act more approprate they won't have such problems.,1351728000,,167,5.0
3701496,4,B001MVYURU,Had a good time actually enjoying this flick. I do recommend it as I found it very highly entertaining. Not gonna win anything at Cannes or anywhere else but a great popcorn chomping flick that was very entertaining!,1332201600,,216,4.7105263157894735
3701497,3,B001MVYURU,"Soldiers fight more then the Taliban in this film. Oops we woke up a demon and now we must pay in odd and spooky ways. This is a very original tail with a good cast and odd setting. The female Afghanistan is very pretty and creepy as the woman who is put in the middle of this mess or is she more then that? There is some nice gore effects but the demon it's self is pretty iffy CGI, but you can not have everything. The acting is good and the fast pace will keep you locked in and trying to figure out how are boy's are going to get out alive.  A movie with a fresh story that is worth a look.",1298592000,3,594,3.8292682926829267
3701498,2,B001MVYURU,"Red Sands fails in numerous areas. For one thing, for a supposed horror, why in the world did the entire atmosphere feel more like a typical war movie with army buddies carrying on conversations pertaining to their normal lives? Why did so much of the storyline revolve around that one army leader bossing around the rest of his soldiers while increasingly becoming obnoxious?

These are elements you normally find in a war film, so Red Sands is basically an exaggerated, fictional approach to the real war going on in Afghanistan and nothing remotely qualifying as horror.

Red Sands doesn't even become scary until the final 20 minutes. Until then, you experience army buddies initially acting like typical teenagers basically partying and talking about sex all the time. You experience numerous failed jokes as well, since nobody is particularly good in their acting roles and therefore, nobody made me laugh.

Eventually they stumble upon an Afghan woman and we soon learn she's no ordinary woman, and it's only a matter of time until the rest of the army figures it out (the HARD way).

Red Sands didn't really make much of an impression on me. However, the final 20 minutes does actually make up for *some* of the ordinary boredom I had to put up with for a good portion of the movie. The one scene that involves an Exorcist-like creature creeping around through hallways and rooms... YES! That was definitely good stuff!! I wish more segments were devoted to those kind of shockers.

Bad acting and a failed attempt at a horror atmosphere so it basically feels like just another day roaming the dusty grounds of Afghanistan combine to create one mediocre film.",1294963200,,1667,4.876325088339223
3701499,5,B001MVYURU,"Its about a squad of soldiers in Afghanistan that run afoul of some seriously kick ass spirits called The Djin at a desert outpost they're assigned to. Some things are best given repect and left alone, they should have!",1293667200,,219,4.641025641025641
3701500,5,B001MVYURU,I thought that the movie was really good.shane west was good in the movie. I wish that my fae actor callum blue had survived the movie but other than that it was a great movie.,1289952000,,176,4.057142857142857
3701501,2,B001MVYURU,"I caught this on starz the other night. Unlike some of the other reviews I thought the cast in this movie was great. The story is just average but the movie never bored me. Kind of reminded of the movie The Thing, except in the desert. Decent.",1264291200,,243,4.191489361702128
3701502,3,B001MVYURU,"When I first heard this was a film by director Dead Birds, I knew I had to check out this movie. It arrived quicker then I thought and quickly popped it in the player.

The film starts with one of the dumbest camera tricks in modern horror cinema; you see someone and then other things rapidly flash before your eyes. I cannot think of the name of it, never have, if anyone can name it for me i'd appericate it. I'm not a big fan on war films but I will admit the director did a helluva good job shooting this picture. He could have easily drop the horror elements and made a war film. The movie is slowly paced like Dead Birds but unlike Birds, it really never pays off. I enjoyed the visuals of the movie but it was slow paced and I never got into the film that much.

Overall, for a straight to dvd film this is professionally done. I wouldnt say this film was a total waste of time but wasn't what I was hoping for.",1262822400,,919,4.071823204419889
3701503,3,B001MVYURU,"Red Sands is a direct-to-DVD horror film set in war-torn Afghanistan .  A group of U.S. Soldiers is assigned to observe and guard a strategic desert road.  Along the way they come upon an ancient statue in the mountains and use it for target practice, destroying it.  As luck would have it, one of the soldiers is well-versed in ancient mythology and tells the rest of the group about the lore of Djinn or Genies as most call them.  These ancient spirits were often contained in statues to keep their evil locked away from the world.  In particular the film uses the mythology of the Djinn as spirits made of smokeless fire who are invisible but can possess humans.

We needn't hear anymore to know that our brave soldiers are now in for a lot of trouble.  Of course, it begs the argument that if they did release an evil spirit by destroying the statue, what of the Taliban, who were well known to have destroyed thousands of such relics of ancient times.  You'd think the place would be literally crawling with Djinn.  Ah, but let's not waste time reaching for logic.

The soldiers make their base in an abandoned stone house and the trouble begins when a young women wanders out of the desert.  Who she is and where she comes from doesn't really concern the soldiers much.  Their only worry is that she might be setting them up for an ambush by Taliban forces.  All of the soldiers begin experiencing terrifying visions.  The film takes a decided Anti-American stance as many of these visions revolve around U.S. soldiers killing innocent Afghani people.  This message was heavy-handed to say the least.  One by one, the girl/Djinn begins to turn the soldiers against each other.  Soon they've given up watching the road and are watching each other, succumbing to a wave of paranoia caused by the evil spirit.

The film was directed by Alex Turner whose last film was the very effective Civil War horror film Dead Birds.  Red Sands doesn't fare quite as well.  Its pace is dreadfully slow and it's depiction of American soldiers is extremely unflattering.  Leonard Roberts (late of the ""Heroes"" TV show) does do a solid job as the group's leader who begins to crack severely under the Djinn's influence.

What's lacking in Red Sands is any kind of frights.  We see the creature for scant seconds throughout the film when it decides to shed its female guise and what we get was rather cheap looking CGI.  The plot is interesting but it was executed with little skill and suspense.  That's too bad because I think the mix of the modern with the mythology of the Middle East is interesting.",1258588800,,2590,4.63956043956044
3701504,3,B001MVYURU,"I think this project was very promising... and as my title says, it succeeds in some places while failing in others. Here's the story in 25 words or less: a group of soldiers in Afghanistan break an old statue and release a Djinn (an old spirit who hates humans). So they break the antique and go spend a few nights in a abandoned Afghan house in the middle of nowhere where they must secure the area. And the Djinn attacks...

Now, here are the good and bad things.

BAD - Most of the special effects are horrible... the Djinn at the end is laughable. Simply laughable. In my point of view, the producers/director made the big mistake of saving money at the end of the film (where in fact, they should deliver the goods). That's too bad.

GOOD - Tension. The screenplay does a nice job managing the tension between the men. The dialogs are great and some characters are believable (although some other characters are too stupid for us to create any empathy). And too bad the ending is so frustratingly cheap.

BAD - And the ending is cheap because, unfortunately, this is one of those films who start great and sinks towards the ending... probably because nobody could figure out how to deliver an ending that was truly original.

GOOD - The first half of the script. I think it is almost flawless. But after that, it cannot keep relying on just dreams and hallucinations. It has to deliver the goods... come on... this is a horror film!

BAD - The second half of the script. Ok, the Djin is around, the men are getting affected by the people they killed and the visions... but I kept thinking there was something missing: progression. The film keeps offering what it already gave us in the first half. And the Djinn attacks are lame... and the ending is lame... and it is all sad.

GOOD - Art direction, locations and cinematography. I do not know where the film was shot, but it convinced me. everything regarding these three domains seemed competent enough.

BAD - All the opportunities missed. I think this film could have been absolutely great. But it is underproduced and creatively underdeveloped.

Still I think the film is interesting enough to be recommended. I am sure the director is extremely talented and his next film will be great. And also, this film (even with all the bad things I've pointed) is miles above most horror films available today.

I could give it four stars... but as I said, if you promise something good, you better deliver it! If you don't, all the flaws are twice as noticeable.

Still I recommend it.",1240963200,14,2538,4.580573951434879

Unfortunately this one was full of cliches with a predictable story the end of which I saw coming a mile away.

Not the worst of the genre but I barely made it to the end.",1516406400,,253,4.142857142857143
