8101080,5,B000CRNDBY,It was informative as I am a novice to putting on make up so I found the instructions very easy to follow and appreciated the tips on colors to wear for day of night,1457395200,,165,3.8823529411764706
8101081,4,B000CRNDBY,"I bought this DVD for my daughters and they loved it. Their skin looks better and they wear makeup like a lady should. My husband who never says anything made a comment on how well the girls look. It may not be for the glamous movie star type that may have a professional do their face anyway, but it's perfect for learning how to care for your skin and look your best at work and out for the evening.",1170115200,2,401,4.0886075949367084
8101082,2,B000CRNDBY,"If you are pretty familiar with the applications of makeup, then this may not be for you.  It goes over the basics which I already familiar with.  They could have also done a better job blending the makeup on a couple of the models (even though the models applied the makeup themselves). However, there are not many African-American how-to-apply makeup DVD's on the market so I am glad to add this to my collection.",1166227200,3,415,4.594594594594595
8101083,4,B000CRNDBY,I am glad I bought this dvd.  It contains the basics for applying make up.  I wish it would have went more into going from day to nightlooks.  I'd recommend as a beginners dvd.,1163203200,,176,4.117647058823529
