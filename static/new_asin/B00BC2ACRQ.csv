8565807,5,B00BC2ACRQ,"I love the way this workout is designed: 10 intervals done three times each. The first time each interval is one minute long. The second set, each interval is 45 seconds, and in the third, 30 seconds. It incorporates weights on half of the moves, but it's more light toning than strength training. The emphasis is on cardio. Great workout for those days you don't want to think about choreography but just want to get your heart rate up while also using light weights. I have the Sweat More! DVD, too. That one's also fun, but with a different set-up to give exercisers some variety.",1416614400,,583,4.561904761904762
8565808,1,B00BC2ACRQ,"I have been exercising to DVD's/tapes for 25 years.  I've kept in shape, I've studied dance.  I hated this workout.  It is boring.  The form of the teacher and the ""backup team"" is pretty poor.  I also feel it is unsafe unless you are at a conditioning level pretty close to that of a professional athlete.  While younger folks would be able to do it, doing it with incorrect form at the speed things are done (and that speed almost assures incorrect form) is the sort of thing that can lead to injury or chronic pain later.  I'm not a professional, but I've worked for dance companies and I found nothing worthwhile here.",1366934400,,622,4.451327433628318
8565809,5,B00BC2ACRQ,"I have done this workout twice already,it's a good total body workout it does work the total body. On Collage Video.com it is rated Intermediate and in my opinion that is what it is. If your looking for a Cathe type workout this is not it, to me it's not AS intense as Cathe's,in my opinion. It did get my heart rate up and I did sweat but not like I do with Cathe. Don't get me wrong this is still a good workout on days when you don't wanna be jumping around,or when you want something a little easier. Jen is really nice, good instructor, cues great. This is the first time I had heard of her and of course worked out with her. Ok,now to the workout. You have 3 Circuits,Circuit 1 you do for 60 seconds,then Circuit 2 you do for 45 seconds,Circuit 3 you do for 30 seconds. The moves you do in circuit 1 for 60 seconds you repeat them in circuits 2 and 3. On circuits 2 and 3 you get a little faster with the moves. By the time your done with the whole workout you actually repeated the moves 3 times. At the end of circuits 2 and 3 you do cardio core that is the cardio core bonuses that are included. There are 3 different cardio core bonuses and they are tacked on at the end of circuits 2 and 3 and at the beginning of the cooldown,they are not seperate. On the main menu you have:  Introduction,Play All,Circuit 1 warm up and 60 second intervals,Circuit 2 cardio core segment and 45 second intervals,Circuit 3 cardio core segment and 30 second intervals,then Core cooldown and stretch. You can choose to do each one seperate BUT on Circuits 2 and 3 there is no warmup in the beginning and there is not a seperate warmup, and of course you have the cooldown and stretch seperate. It consists of 10 intervals for each circuit,each circuit you do the 10 intervals which is the SAME move on each circuit,for example you do mountain climbers in circuit 1, SO you will repeat mountain climbers in circuits 2,3. Every move in Circuit 1 you repeat in circuits 2 and 3. If you want to do them seperate Circuit 1 lasts right around 20 minutes cooldown seperate, Circuit 2 lasts 13 minutes 39 seconds cooldown seperate and Circuit 3 lasts 12 minutes 45 seconds cooldown seperate. The cardio core cooldown and stretch lasts 7 minutes 24 seconds. I liked this workout well enough that I ordered her second Sweat workout, Sweat More,the format is a little different,but you still do everything 60 seconds then 45 seconds then 30 seconds. In this workout you do curtsy lunges then overhead press and I have to admit my booty was sore and my shoulders as well. In Circuits 2 and 3 she tells you to try to go faster. She does have a lady that is doing lower impact moves. I put my all into it and went heavier on the weights I used 10lbs,and that seemed fine for me. If you choose to Playall it is continuous and it lasts about 54 minutes. And another move you do your in a plank with weights in hand then you bring one hand up with the weight bring elbow up by your side and twist working the upper back,I have to say I'm sore from that move as well. It's a good Total Body workout. I would recommend this workout. The music in this workout I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!from start to finish. Got a good beat to it. If you like Interval Training you will like it.",1361145600,3,3241,4.2699186991869915
