I think my husband who scuba dives could have done a better job of filming a video.  We haven't looked at the still pictures on the dvd yet.  Hopefully they'll be okay to look at.  We're actually going to Bonaire this month (Feb. 08), and I bought this for my husband's January birthday to get him psyched to dive there, but were bummed watching this video.  Way too expensive for what you get in our opinion.",1202428800,,538,4.494845360824742
