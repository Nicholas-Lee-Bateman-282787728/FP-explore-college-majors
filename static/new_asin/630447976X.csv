889117,2,630447976X,"This was Elvis' first ""bad"" movie, in my opinion. The reasons for this lie in the awkward, and unnecessary, interpolation of musical numbers which bear little relevance to the on-screen action. While the film has a nice look, the locale is especially pleasant, and the supporting cast is good (particularly Gig Young) ""Kid Galahad"" strays from its original dramatic source to focus more on current youth fads such as tight sweaters and the Twist.
The film is burdened with lightweight, disposable songs (with the exception of ""King of the Whole Wide World""), and concentrates more on standard boy-girl frolics than on the central dramatic story of a seriously gifted prize-fighter. Even with Charles Bronson and an uncredited Ed Asner in the supporting cast (indicating that the original intention was to make a solid action-drama film)""Kid Galahad"" is the first serious mis-step in Elvis's film catalogue. With few exceptions, his subsequent films virtually jettisoned drama in favour of pop-gloss.",1072483200,2,999,5.329113924050633
889118,5,630447976X,"""Kid Galahad"" stars Elvis as an ex-G.I. who comes back to his hometown in upper state New York. Beautiful scenery, I might add. He wants to be an auto mechanic after returning from the Army, but instead he's reluctantly roped into being trained to be a boxer. Elvis has an anvil-fist and an iron jaw. Soon, he becomes boxing champ nicknamed ""Kid Galahad"". Joan Blackman returns and plays Elvis' love interest and the sister of the boxing camp owner Gig Young. Great picture formula, great songs and beautiful and breathtaking mountain scenery. Recommend this must-see to everyone.",1036800000,7,580,4.989690721649485
889119,5,630447976X,"KID GALAHAD (1962) is an excellent boxing movie. If you liked the ROCKY series, you will enjoy this movie of an ex-GI who has a winning knock-out punch. Elvis is credible as a boxer. The rags to riches story also rings true. Elvis himself rose from poverty to become the most popular and successful performer in the world.

The opening scene sequence is unforgettable with Elvis riding on the back of a Mayflower truck singing KING OF THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. There are six songs including I GOT LUCKY. Musically, Elvis is in top form in this movie.

This is a remake of a 1937 movie that starred Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson. The 1937 version was directed by Michael Curtiz who directed CASABLANCA and the Elvis movie KING CREOLE in 1958. The movie examines the corruption that was endemic to boxing and the gambling and crime associated with it.

Oscar-winner Gig Young is excellent as the promoter and DEATH WISH's Charles Bronson gives a spectacular performance as the trainer.

Elvis' acting is very good here although he is not really allowed to show his acting chops. It was a wasted opportunity. The hard edges and the harsher aspects of boxing were toned down. This movie could have been a breakout role for Elvis, but he was not allowed to show his full dramatic range. His image as a happy-go-lucky, safe entertainer had to be maintained at the expense of a strong dramatic performance. In short, Elvis was not allowed to develop and explore the dramatic depths of his character. Compared to ROCKY, the movie falls way short. Nevertheless, Elvis gives a good, convincing performance as the rising boxing star.

The song sequences are excellent especially one where Elvis and Young and Bronson are riding in a jalopy that Elvis restored and painted red. The I GOT LUCKY sequence is fun to watch.

A man who can sing when he ain't got a thing, he's the king of the whole wide world. Indeed. Nobody proved it better than Elvis, the King of Rock and Roll and the Artist of the Century. Follow that dream. It can take you to the top. But when you get there, will you be the same person?",1031961600,7,2099,4.613941018766756
889120,4,630447976X,"I have not seen the original ""Kid Galahad"", but this one was very good, compared to anything, not just Elvis' other movies. I wouldn't agree with the ""Oh well, at least it's not as bad as his others"" angle that many seem to take. I think anyone would enjoy it. It has a good cast surrounding Elvis, most notably Gig Young and Charles Bronson. This movie also further proves that Elvis was a good actor, given the chance. The whole movie just seems to click, somehow. And about the songs, give them a break! It's an Elvis movie. The man can sing! Let him! Be thankful it wasn't a musical. It had a few songs, yes, but that fact is not nearly as annoying as others try to paint it. It had a great depiction of the corruption of the boxing industry, and some good fighting scenes. Elvis looked like he enjoyed his part and was interested, contrary to many other opinions, and by no means was he ""chubby"". He was very well-built, and worked with a real-life boxing trainer, who said that Elvis could've been a professional fighter. So anyone who says he wasn't convincing as a boxer should take a second look. Watch this movie, not compared to anything, but just as the movie itself, and there's a big chance you'll enjoy it.",1019174400,3,1221,4.431111111111111
889121,4,630447976X,"When I first saw this movie, I wasn't really expecting much.  There are a few things in all Elvis movies that are the same (He sings, gets the girl, and everything works out in the end.)  But I wasn't expecting to get  wrapped up in this great 1963 boxing movie.  Elvis plays a young man who  takes up boxing just to make some money.  This movie is wicked cheesy, but  it is really good.  About half way through the movie, you will realize that  you really do like this movie.  It's a guilty pleasure, and it's a knock  out!",952646400,4,524,4.191919191919192

889123,2,630447976X,"Elvis sings to Charles Bronson and doesn't get punched out in this boxing drama based on a golden oldie from the Warner Bros. vaults.  The original  ""Kid Galahad"" had Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, and Bette  Davis, none of whom sang to each other (or sang at all), but it did have a  better script and a better director in the person of Michael Curtiz, who  directed Presley's ""King Creole"" (as well as  ""Casablanca"").  B movie maverick Phil Karlson takes the reins  here with indifferent results. Gig Young inherits the Eddie G. role while a  bland looking Elvis stands in for the blander Wayne Morris in the title  role.  Elvis sings six songs, three of them pretty good (""King of the  Whole Wide World,"" ""Home is Where the Heart Is,"" and ""I  Got Lucky""), but otherwise looks chubby and bored.  The entire film  has a rather unpleasant look, as if the powers that be (the Mirisch  brothers or Colonel Tom Parker?) were deliberately attempting to move away  from the lush travelogue qualities of the previous year's ""Blue  Hawaii"" which, incidentally, also found the King wooing his co-star  here, Joan Blackman.  All in all, better than most of the Presley movies  that were still to come, but far from a knockout.",928281600,2,1223,4.728571428571429

They were not typical and a lot of fun. Famous movie stars like Charles Bronson really made the film a classic. U have to see this movie if ur a big Elvis fan.

889380,4,630447976X,"Released in 1962, Kid Galahad stars Elvis as an ex-GI who returns to his rustic home town in upstate New York looking for employment as a mechanic. He's roped into becoming a boxer by a dubious manager-turned-innkeeper (Gig Young) while catching the eye of his kid sister (Joan Blackman). With the mentorship of his trainer (Charles Bronson), he quickly becomes the top-drawing champion ""Kid Galahad."" Then the mob tries to muscle in on the action. Lola Albright plays the innkeepers significant other and assistant.

I prefer the more serious Elvis flicks (1964s Roustabout) to the silly farces (1966s Spinout) and Kid Galahad"" falls into the former bracket. While boxing is a big part of the plot, don't expect the urban-situated Rocky films or Southpaw (2015). What sets Kid Galahad apart is the setting  the awesome lodge in the mountains. In the story its supposed to be either the Catskills or Adirondack Mountains, but its obvious that it was shot out west. Regardless, the locations are exemplary. Beyond that, the story is dramatic and compelling.

The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in Idyllwild, California, with studio work done in Culver City.

889793,5,630447976X,"This is a fun Elvis Presley movie, where, being Irish and an Army veteran, Elvis, along with Charles Bronson, is fighting for the boxing championship, while battling corruption from the Mafia.

Typical of Elvis, he spontaneously sings, while surrounded by adoring females, and all of us guys wish we were him!

So far, I've purchased five (05) Elvis Presley movies, and used a couple of them to learn to sing a few of his songs (which I've recorded and posted on the YOU TUBE web site, and on my own personal web site, ""OUR ETERNAL STRUGGLE"").",1357430400,,543,4.645833333333333

This type of movie is great for me to share with my young granddaughters.  It is typical Elvis fare, but it is a great story about an underdog boxer, who wants nothing more that to be a mechanic and own his own garage.  He falls in love with his manager's sister, played by the breathtaking Joan Blackman (who also co-starred with Elvis in Blue Hawaii).  It is wholesome entertainment from a much simpler time in America.",1319673600,,569,4.423076923076923

889800,4,630447976X,"Years ago, I read that according to Elvis' pals the Memphis mafia, Presley and co-star Charles Bronson did not get along well on the set of this film. I won't mention the specifics out of respect for both legendary performers, but basically, it seemed to be a personality clash between the young, fun loving Elvis and the older, more serious and  taciturn Bronson. Watching the film, you feel like there is an almost brotherly bond between Presley as the title charactor, and tough guy Bronson as his tough but sensitive trainer. The sources I read stated that this is made possible mainly by Bronson's stalwart professionalism. Of course, it's a two-way process, and Elvis' performance in this semi-serious drama shows he was a better actor then most folks gave him credit for",1224979200,2,777,4.886363636363637

889885,4,630447976X,"This 1962 remake of ""Kid Galahad"" provides a decent acting vehicle for Elvis Presley. Relatively few songs (mostly forgettable) as director Phil Karlson focuses on the boxing milieu. A stronger-than-average cast includes Gig Young, Lola Albright and Charles Bronson. Unfortunately, the film's moderate box-office success prevented Elvis from venturing into more dramatic territory  which is a pity, since he could deliver the goods when given half a chance.",1140480000,7,457,5.720588235294118
889886,5,630447976X,"Released in Europe two yeas ago, what took MGM so long to release this Elvis classic to North America?  They say that Elvis always wanted to get a chance to do some serious acting and his performance in ""Kid Galahad"" is as close to that chance as I think he ever got.  Besides being fairly well acted the musical score for ""Kid Galahad"" although only six songs is also one of Elvis's best when it comes to his theatrical career.

Staring along side Joan Blackman who he acted with in ""Blue Hawaii"" and a small role in ""Follow That Dream,"" Elvis handles his make believe role as a want to be boxer fairly well.  Although he is known as an entertainer he almost makes the fight scenes in the movie look believable.  One thing you will notice in this film is that Elvis's hair is its nature color, not that dyed jet-black look that he wore in most of his other jump around, chaotic made for the screen films.  So if you want an entertaining film with an acceptable music score then take ""Kid Galahad"" home as a keeper",1135382400,5,1014,4.338624338624339

Elvis shines in his portrayal of Walter Gulick, a now former soldier who becomes a boxer. The rest of the cast is also terrific, mainly Gig Young and a supporting role by Charles Bronson. Once again, Joan Blackman (from Blue Hawaii) plays Elvis's love interest- If you have only seen Elvis in some of the silly films from the 60's than you need to see Kid Galahad, you will see the true actor in Elvis...if only he had been given the chance to do more dramatic roles he might have been more appreciated for his acting and not just his singing.",1128211200,35,709,4.2518518518518515
889889,5,630447976X,"Elvis Presley movies fall into 4 groups.  There are the films made before he entered the Army, when he was a true rocker.  Check out Loving You, Jailhouse Rock or King Creole if you want to see what all the fuss was about in the 50's.  The music, the moves, the sneering smile--Elvis, the original.

  The concert movies which chronicle the Vegas road show from the last part of his career provide a striking contrast to his early rock and roll films--from rebel to caricature in less than 15 years.

  The movies for which Elvis is infamous (Girl Happy, Clambake, Spinout, etc.)were made somewhere in between, and Presley should be remembered for making these--the songs were lousy, the movies were stupid, and there were too many of them to be considered just an error in his professional judgement.  Even the best of them, Viva Las Vegas, follows the tired formula of the others and barely succeeds on the support of a great title track and an unbearably sexy Ann Margret.

  Elvis did, however, make a handful of films shortly after leaving the Army that showed a willingness to experiment in different genres, address adult issues and to perform in character.  The western, Flaming Star, cast him as a half breed caught in one of those battles between settlers and American Indians.  It's not The Searchers, but in the hands of director Don Siegel, it is a good film, and Elvis is good in it.  Wild in the Country was probably the greatest stretch of Presley's acting career--he plays a young writer falling in love with his mentor.  Not a great movie, and Elvis shows the limits of his talent.  But, he gave it a shot.  The two movies produced by the Mirisch Company, Follow That Dream and Kid Galahad, are probably the best of his post-Army career.  Both had superior scripts, excellent supporting casts and small but above average collections of songs; more importantly, they gave Elvis some memorable scenes in which he does quite well.  And, while Elvis is the star, he does not monopolize these films.  They are not just good Elvis movies, they are good movies.

  Follow That Dream is a comedy which foreshadows TV's Beverly Hillbillies, although Elvis' deadpan portrayal of Toby Kwimper is much funnier than Max Baer's best day as Jethro Bodine.  Kid Galahad is a boxing melodrama, and because of the strong performances by Gig Young, Lola Albright and Charles Bronson, Galahad wins in a very closely scored bout.  The story is similar in many ways to another boxing movie about a contender with a knockout punch.  Again, this is no Million Dollar Baby, but it does have a special kind of charm, and Presley is at his most charming here.  Elvis made so few good films--the best, such as Kid Galahad, deserve wide screen DVD treatment.",1110412800,10,2747,4.736286919831223

7872884,5,630447976X,"This is 5 stars as a ""really good Elvis Presley movie"", not 5 stars as ""one of the greatest films ever"".  I had read a couple of the 1962 reviews--Variety, Bosley Crowther for NYT--and, after seeing the movie for myself, was really shocked how bad the reviews were, really unfairly so, imo. Maybe there was some envy involved because Presley is perfectly convincing to me as a former GI who is a mechanic roped into a big money local boxing match against a fighter b acked by the mob.

This is his tenth movie, and his persona just feels so real. He's not surly and swaggering like James Dean or a taciturn tough guy like Humphrey Bogart who starred in the earlier version of this film. No, Presley is the breathtakingly handsome and likeable ""nice guy""--polite and unaffected, genuine and kind, a little nave, who falls in love at first sight and always is trying to do the right thing. He's in good contrast with Gig Young (the critics split on his performance but I thought he was excellent--the character who starts out as a charming weasel and has the most growth of anyone. Charles Bronson has a big part and is also good. There's other good support, including Ed Asner and some others you'll know from longrunning supporting roles. All real pros.

It's a feel good film with a lot of attractive people and a plot that moves right along and, though not revolutionary, is never dull. Plus, yes, Presley sings! (Crowther thought a prizefighter would never be a singer, but he sells it so...why not?) If you like Elvis, despite Colonel Parker's negative effect on his career (making the choices all about money not art even though he clearly has acting talent, too), this is one of his best.",1502841600,,1694,4.621262458471761
