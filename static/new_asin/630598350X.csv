7899178,1,630598350X,"There is no way around the conclusion that this production was a major embarrassment to everyone associated with it and a career breaker to some.

Castwise, Mena Suvari and Gabriel Mann somehow manage to maintain their dignity despite the total meltdown around them and Alexandra Wentworth actually turns in an excellent performance in one of the supporting roles. But Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia are unbelievably awful and the rest of the cast are not much better.

The concept was fairly original or at least the most extreme take on an unoriginal concept, but at the last minute it gutlessly pulls back for a lame moralistic ending.

The directing, production design, and editing are all about as bad as you will find in a mainstream production. Bad enough that the movie would be a useful bad example for students in film school.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1125360000,5,882,4.782894736842105
7899179,1,630598350X,"I read about ""American Virgin"" when it was still called ""Live Virgin"" on an British movie magazine, and the review then was not good at all.  Now I found its title changed owing to Mena Suvari's rising stardom, and I got it on Amazon co. jp.  (Thanks for your fast delivery).  Well, I tell you, fans of lovely Mena, I found this turns out to be really ... bad.
Let me correct one misunderstanding (if you have) on your side that this is a Mena Suvari film.  No.  It's stars are Robert Loggia (""Independence Day"") and Bob Hoskins (""Monalisa""), and Mena plays the secondary role no matter what you see on the video jacket.  The male players are adult film directors, and kind of rivals to each other.  And daddy Robert finds her daughter Mena Suvari is going to 'star' in Bob's live-net show, in which Mena loses her virginity, sharing the experience on the net with audience wearing green-colored techno-suits which give the same sensation the lucky guy is going to have....  Oh dear.
But of course, this is a comedy, and actually I found little nudity (and none of Mena, thank Heaven), so guys, don't be mistaken.  The film is totally devoid of humor, and the two veteran actors are only swearing dirty words in public, on TV, and whenever they get a chance, and the film seems to think it's funny.  Mena's boyfriend is a crying mama's boy, and trying to do something to change her mind, always breaks something in an awkward way.  But I never found a single moment even slightly funny during the course ... but remember, I am a Japanese, and that's because cultural diference.  But I laughed lots of good and healthy laughs while watching ""American Pie.""
Probably, besides the dismally made sequel to ""Carrie,"" this is a film Mena Suvari wants to forget.  If you're a truly devoted fan of her, watch it.",1019952000,10,1804,4.565217391304348
7899180,2,630598350X,"You have a movie called American Virgin - it stars Mena Suvari and has the comical Bob Hoskins - why was I bored?
It has a really good concept and the cast sounds really appealing but it was not as I expected it.
Mena Suvari plays the Live Virgin who will lose her virginity on air when she hits 18. I felt that her character was dense and was not brought out enough.
Bob Hoskins plays the director of Live Virgin. He has some great humour and his character is great...but there was something missing.
I think there is something missing from the movie as a whole. Although there are some funny moments I felt a little uninterested as the film progressed. And then you have the big finale which is exactly as I expected...happy ever after. Why for once can't they break the rules and have a satisfying/entertaining ending?
The movie is watchable and not a bad attempt at all.",1013817600,2,874,4.434782608695652
7899181,3,630598350X,"When a young beautiful woman (Mena Suvari) decides to lose her virginity in a live boardcast show in the internet. When her father (Robert Loggia)-her porno filmmaker dad decides to stop her to before she does it but a Preverted Filmmaker (Bob Hopkins) is going to direct his daughter for the show. The pair of Porn Peddlers go to war.
Directed by Jean Pierre-Marois (Which he also Co-Wrote the film with Ira Israel) made a film that has some good laughs and a good premise but it has annoying performances by Loggia and Hopkins, despite a solid cast. This film has little to offer, not for all comic viewing. Grade:B-.",1011225600,3,619,4.636363636363637
7899182,2,630598350X,"I always like to say that it is best to review a movie in the context of what it is trying to be. I have a different set of expectations for a Hollywood Blockbuster than I do for something from the Sundance Film Festival and I have a different set of expectations from a romantic comedy and an erotic thriller.
Unfortunately, I don't think that American Virgin knows what it wants to be. Given the Cast (Mena Suvari, Bob Hoskins, Robert Loggia) one might expect a sophisticated comedy. Given the subject matter and setting (a porn producer fighting his rival for the film rights to his daughter's deflowering) as well as the supporting cast (several actual actors from the worlds of porn and erotica) one might expect a campy late-night, Cinemax sexual slapstick. The Trailer and description suggest a dark comedy about sexuality in American society. The film tries to be all of these at times and ends up falling short constantly.
As a serious comedy, it immediately fails.  Suvari apparently made this film before her break through roles (in fact, its original title, ""Live Virgin"" was apparently changed to capitalize on her success in ""American Pie"" and ""American Beauty"", both far better films). Hoskins and Loggia have both performed a slew of better roles. The film simply isn't as well plotted and performed as one might hope  a mainstream comedy would be.
As a titillating farce the film equally fails. The comedy tries to alternate between situational ironies, one-line zingers, visual sight-gags and slapstick hijinks. Its failure to commit to one and follow through causes confusion in the viewer and calls attention to the films other failures and inconsistencies. In a lower budget film, these failures might be covered up through the misdirection of constant nudity or frequent sexual interludes, but contrary to what one might think upon reading a synopsis of this film, there is only brief nudity  (by characters that one wouldn't even consider in supporting roles) and only the smallest hint of sex or eroticism (it almost doesn't bare mentioning).
Most disappointing is the films inability to be the dark and poignant comedy that given the subject matter it could have been. There is a message of social commentary buried deep (very deep) inside all of the other non-sense that occurs. But it is only barely explored and all but lost amid the  confusion of the rest of the film.
I won't go so far as to give the film a 1, because there are a few laughs to held, and because the film is trying to do something somewhat ambitious. I can't recommend it as any more of a curiosa worth owning to complete Suvari's trifecta of virginal roles with the word American in the title or as a film worth dissecting in a fit of boredom. It is truly sad that this couldn't be so much more.",978220800,17,2793,4.77639751552795
7899183,1,630598350X,"I would not normally take time to do this but I feel I should save anyone I can on this one.
DONT DO IT...Step away from the VCR...
I rented this movie because I was hoping to (honestly) =P see some action with Mena Suvari!  Well, I was painfully disappointed!!  The movie is not only poorly written and directed but the acting could probably be smelt three counties away during filming.  Although I do like several of the actors, they were, by far, at their worst.  The only moment in the entire movie that was worth the strain to focus your eyes, was when Joey, played by Bob Hoskins, was tied up, tortured, and ""revived"" by his wife.  If you've seen it you know what I mean, if you haven't, it's not worth it!
If you still feel the need to see this movie, please rent it!  (And make sure you rent at least one other title to watch after you turn this one off in the first 10 minutes.)
Hope this helps=)...",973209600,15,908,4.219653179190751
7899184,1,630598350X,"No bottom ten list would be complete without this torturously bad film.  This moronic farce stars Mena Suvari, who it seems has decided to make a career out of playing characters trying to lose their virginity.
Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia play two rival porn directors who hate one another because Ronny (Loggia) stole Joey's (Hoskins) wife.  Joey takes revenge by recruiting Ronny's daughter Katrina (Suvari) to lose her virginity via a cable hookup where viewers can participate in the event by wearing a special sex simulation suit.  Sally Kellerman plays a sleazy, Jerry Springer type talk show host who interviews Joey and Katrina and follows the story to the end.
This film fails on just about every level imaginable.  The script is trash.  The dialogue is imbecilic.  There is no acting, just a bunch of people screaming at the top of their lungs and running around like lunatics.  There isn't even any real sexual content.  The entire film is like a series of Jerry Springer outtakes.
This abomination has earned the bestowal of my lowest dishonor: a rating of 1/10 (a rare besmirching).  Do not eat for 5 hours before attempting to watch this film.",971049600,9,1159,4.872448979591836
