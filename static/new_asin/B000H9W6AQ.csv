You do get 5 discs, which have 5 videos on each side of 2 sided discs, but they are unusable.  The discs cannot even be recorded over with your own content making them just so much trash.  If you want the old classic movies, then search for the individuals discs from a reputable company that will at least give you something useful for your money.",1428364800,3,496,4.406593406593407

8137788,1,B000H9W6AQ,"This DVD set is awful --- I am shocked and disgusted that the manufacturer actually got away with marketing it!  Among the glaring errors and malfunctions are:
(1) the picture sometimes get ""stuck"" (the moving image ""freezes"" in several places)
(2) one disc is apparently too ""full"" --- it has material that is recorded too far out toward the edge of the disc, and so the DVD player has trouble ""reading"" that portion of the movie because the player's laser head mechanism isn't even designed to move outward that far
(3) the Sherlock Holmes movie ""The Sign of Four"" is apparently missing from the collection --- nothing happens when you select that title on the start menu (I tested the disc on two different DVD players, and the same thing happened with both of them)
(4) it has the absolute worst resolution and picture quality of any DVD material I have ever seen --- it looks like it was recorded from some low-budget Internet movie downloads!  Many of the images are extremely ""pixelled"" (large square blocks of solid color instead of sharp recognizable detail, just like it was in those old '80s video games) and smudgy, often to the point of being totally unviewable.  It is often impossible to understand what's going on in the movies --- don't waste your viewing time!  Find a separate DVD of the movie you want, where the picture quality and resolution will almost certainly be far better than these disgraceful copies.",1223078400,12,1430,4.777327935222672
