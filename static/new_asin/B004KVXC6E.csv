8433494,5,B004KVXC6E,"My 7-year-old son loves it. I bought Vol1 first for longer trip for our minivan TV. Goal achieved. :) Recently he asked for Vol2 himself. He started to read the chapter books too. As far as I looked in these cartoon episodes, the stories are so well built and captivate the viewer entirely. When we arrive home in the garage, he often asks me not to stop the engine yet. :)",1440979200,,373,4.267605633802817

8433496,5,B004KVXC6E,"My kids and their friends love Geronimo Stilton DVDs.  We have got both Volume 1 and 2.  They have been reading the books, and after watching the DVDs, they wanted to read the books even more.",1387324800,,192,4.305555555555555
8433497,3,B004KVXC6E,"Note, this may just be my copy, but the menus on this DVD are awful!  The clickable areas don't coincide with the image on the screen except in the loosest possible way.  I have a hard time navigating these, but for my 6yo daughter, it's almost impossible.  That said, the shows themselves, if you can get to them, are a lot of fun, especially if your child has already read the books.",1378944000,,385,4.319444444444445
8433498,5,B004KVXC6E,I bought this as a gift for my grandson.  He was so thrilled I was able to locate it.  Very exicted.,1376438400,,100,3.7142857142857144
8433499,5,B004KVXC6E,I ripped the DVD's using ClipWrap so I could put them on an iPad - if I hadn't I think the DVD would have been worn out by now. These are so much better than most of the stuff on TV/Cable. Watching these also make reading the Geronimo Stilton books easier and more fun for my son who finds reading extremely challenging.,1353456000,,320,4.17741935483871
8433500,5,B004KVXC6E,"my ten year old daughter finally found chapter books that hold her interest. These are well written, colorful, and are engaging to read. I wish there were more video sets..she can't put the books down...Highly reccommend.",1331424000,2,221,5.166666666666667
8433501,5,B004KVXC6E,"THE TV SHOW IS DIFFENCE THAN THE BOOK.
ITS GREAT TO WATCH.
MAINLY GERONIMO AND SALLY TRY TO MATCH WITS

TEA IS BETTER THAN SALLY.
AND I HOPE THAT THE TEA SISTER HAVE THEY OWN SHOW.",1323216000,,201,3.926829268292683
