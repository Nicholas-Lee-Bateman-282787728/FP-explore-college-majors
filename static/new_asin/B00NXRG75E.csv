6684454,5,B00NXRG75E,"Having already bought the first two series [bought at a library book sale!]....I had to have this. Ridiculously funny. It's flawed, as are the first 2 seasons, but maybe the chances taken are what I like about it so much. There aren't as many ""new stories"" in this, the last season. It really tries to sorta tie up lose ends between the characters we already know so they could end it on a pos note. [?] I wouldn't be surprised to see a movie or 2, but Roxburgh has said it was meant to be 3 seasons, there will be no 4th, if there was, it won't be seen til '16, so... He seems a wee bit tired in this, but as I understand it, he was the producer this time as well, as the other bloke came here for the US version which was a flop. I haven't seen it, tho', so....But maybe that's the point, he wants to right all his wrongs. If you enjoy Australian comedy, you will love this. Esp the ending of the last episode. I won't spoil it. Wish all tv was this creative. Australians have crassness down to an art. It doesn't seem crass!",1420070400,,1027,4.114427860696518

6684457,4,B00NXRG75E,Still good but not as laugh out loud funny as season 1 and 2.,1417132800,,61,3.4285714285714284

6684459,4,B00NXRG75E,Really enjoy this Aussie production.  Actors and storyline are great.  Easy to see why the US version did not make it when compared to the original.  Highly recommended for anyone who has a dry wit.,1416700800,12,198,4.6
6684460,5,B00NXRG75E,"Watching Rake is akin to a Shakespeare's play - full of bawdy humor, sly jokes, larger than life characters - but in a modern setting.  I hope there is a Season 4!",1416182400,6,163,4.09375
6684461,4,B00NXRG75E,Love love this show. Arrived on time. One important issue. NO CLOSED CAPTIONING! Dang. Had I known this I wouldn't have purchased.,1416096000,,130,4.954545454545454

BUT Series 3, episode 2 won't play.  I get episode 3 instead and when I play episode 3, I get episode 3.  Any explanation, fix or others with the same problem?

Thank you Acorn TV.",1494806400,,257,4.711111111111111
6684464,5,B00NXRG75E,"I am totally in love with the irrepressible irreverent Rake.  His childlike behaviours, offbeat sense of humour, acute attention to detail and his overall anti-establishment attitudes range from whimsical to moving to insightful to humble to magical. His lack of impulse control, aided by imbibing various chemicals serves to highlight his oh-so-human flaws....I find myself first cringing.....then saying ""oh no"".....and finally being awed.  By the way in which his A.D.D. and frenzied unrealistic expectations resolve into a single brilliant thread. He displays a range and depth of emotion and character that is seldom seen in American drama. He manages to pull off being ridiculous and infantile in his acting out, but so utterly redeeming. I found myself laughing out loud at the slapstick episode in which he scurries around like a chicken without a head, trying to manage three cases in different venues simultaneously. And at the end of the last episode, I shed a tear. How perfect!  PLEASE PLEASE give us more seasons of Rake!",1494374400,,1035,5.22289156626506
6684465,5,B00NXRG75E,"It's RARE that the third season of great series has the zest of the first two --but I can easily say Rake's  third season is its best! Not unlike a Thanksgiving meal --- laboured over for days, devoured in minutes -- this series was exquisitely executed and therefore 'devoured' in one sitting! The dialogue well written, the plots alternately funny, touching and smart -- all coalesce to keep you hanging in, wanting more.
The tension between the main character, ""Cleaver Greene"" and the important women in his life who struggle to keep good boundaries (because the Charmer pulls each devilishly close to the edge) are some of the best. ""Cleave""  is a good friend, no, he is a great and loyal friend (most of the time) but he is traitorous and incapable as an intimate partner. He is brilliant in the courtroom, while his capacity for self-sabotage is equally jaw-dropping. While he is astute regarding the law and his powers of deductive reasoning Sherlockian (well, that's a stretch), he seems wholly incapable of learning from his mistakes on a personal level. This highly flawed, deeply self-deprecating character whose not hard on the eyes is immensely enjoyable.
Now, when may I have Season 4 on Netflix, please?",1492560000,,1219,4.912621359223301

6684472,5,B00NXRG75E,Found seasons one and two in Netflix and was hooked. This series is everything the US series isn't. The US remake tried too hard to be funny but the original Autrailian series was hilarious without the forced effort. The cast was outstanding and Richard Roxburgh is a comedy genius.,1464307200,2,282,4.775510204081633

6684478,4,B00NXRG75E,"I gave it 4 stars, but it would be 5 if it had subtitles, which are really, really needed when you're trying to make sense of the Australian version of English. Another reviewer, who gave it 1 star for lacking subtitles--and I totally understand why he did--suggests that Amazon require subtitles, or, in the alternative, require sellers to say in large letters that there are none. I think that reviewer is right. In general, it is only fair to put warnings on videos that people who are deaf or hard of hearing cannot hear. But beyond that, when people speak with accents that make their speech unintelligible about 70% of the time, there ought to be captions. And there are captions for Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix. So I don't see why captions wouldn't be available on DVD for Season 3. The reason I gave it 4 stars (and it should be 5) is because this is a terrific series. Really original. Brilliantly written. Acted to perfection. Lush, vile, profane, intelligent. It's a wonderful series that ranks not quite as high as Breaking Bad or The Wire--nothing does-- but if they're a 10 this is a 9. Warning: It was remade as an American series. The American series was a disaster. Get the one with Richard Roxburgh, he's marvelous. Also, considering that other reviewers have said that the quality of the DVDs is pretty bad, it would be better to watch it on Netflix. If you want to wait to watch the whole series, the person at Netflix told me that they wait until Season 4 comes out to release Season 3, which is plenty annoying, but that's what they said. They started filming Season 4 in Sept. of 2015, and it hasn't premiered yet. So the best you can do at this point is to catch Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix, get Season 3 on DVD and wait with the rest of us for Season 4 to be released.",1454544000,,1791,4.397590361445783

I also hear season 4 is in making, I wonder how many years, I will have to wait for that one. The stories are great. Richard Roxburgh is brilliant, awesome and just perfect. I was laughing and it was great to be reunited with Cleave, Barny, Nicole, Harry Potter, Cal, Scarlet and the rest of the guys. Such a great show.",1453680000,12,470,4.175824175824176

6684482,2,B00NXRG75E,"We enjoyed the first two seasons so much I bought Season 3.  Unfortunately there are no subtitles, so we missed a lot of dialogue. The prison episode was dreary, and the next episode only marginally better. I think the writers are out of ideas, certainly out of humorous dialogue and situations.  Not sure if we'll keep going.",1452124800,2,326,4.701754385964913

Video quality is 6 / 10.  No subtitles - how can you sell a foreign language film (Australian) and not have American subtitles.  LOL!",1443398400,2,301,3.966666666666667

This is very dry humor, with a bit of legalese thrown in. he is a character that u cont to root fore, even when he let's u down, time and time again. unlike many series, the writing just gets better and better. can't wait for season 4. the main prob i have with this series NO subtitles, and sometimes ,much is lost because of the heavy accents",1437350400,,375,4.222222222222222
6684492,5,B00NXRG75E,"My wife and I loved this whole series -- it's wonderfully imaginative and, what's rare for TV, totally unique.  We saw S1 and S2 on streaming video, but S3 hasn't been released yet, so we had to buy the DVD.  Couldn't quit at the end of S2 -- not with the main character in such dire straits!",1436572800,,292,4.105263157894737
6684493,5,B00NXRG75E,This is a great series.  I couldn't wait for the 3rd season to be available to stream so went ahead and bought the discs.  Not disappointed at all.

6684496,4,B00NXRG75E,I was disappointed & do not believe it as excellent as the first 2 series. Still it beats American crap in my opinion & therefore I do recommend it if yr a die-hard fan of Rake.,1431216000,,177,3.9444444444444446

6684498,5,B00NXRG75E,"Several years ago the American networks made a big deal about having invented a new art form: the ""dramedy"". Frankly I felt the examples they trotted out (""Slap Maxwell"", ""Molly Dodd"") never really worked. They seemed to be just sitcoms that weren't particularly funny.
The Australians nailed it. ""Rake"" is hilarious. I think the difference - and this is critical - is that there aren't really any jokes. If the direction were a bit different, these shows could play as straight dramas with very little re-writing. Add in that the casting and writing are both superb and you've got the funniest, smartest show on TV.",1430524800,10,616,4.876190476190477

6684500,1,B00NXRG75E,"The show is great, no question there. The product however is another story. This applies to both Season 2 and 3: I agree with other reviews about the low quality of the video. Furthermore, it should be plain illegal to sell a DVD without any subtitles, especially since they exist (Netflix). Amazon, I know it is not your fault nor your responsibility, but you are in a great position and would have the power to boycott companies who insult and disrespect customers in that way. I cannot believe that there's not been any class action lawsuit from groups helping the people with hearing difficulties. At the very least Amazon and/or the seller should be responsible to post a big warning when no subtitles are available.",1430179200,10,721,4.776

6684503,5,B00NXRG75E,"Can't bear it if this series is over.  Brilliant courtroom show; clever and funny in a way the American courtroom shares rarely are, and sometimes even does the unexpected.  Richard Roxburgh is truly wonderful as the Rake - totally unreliable and irresponsible but somehow we are rooting for him nonetheless because we think there is a good guy underneath it all.

Yes there's some course language, nudity and violence but it's not out of place.  It's a shame that this is not better known.  I certainly hope that they reviewer who said this was the last series is wrong; clever Cleaver Greene is just too good a character to disappear.",1425772800,,399,4.91044776119403

The author's went for more more more of the same in other words.  Roxburgh does great impressions, the comedy is good as this soap opera continues on its way.  Nearly all the characters are hugely dysfunctional and although they attempt to make Cleaver Greene the villainous dysfunctional character, they all feed off of him.  It's predictable in parts but also surprising in others.  If you enjoyed the first two series, then this one must be seen (to be believed if nothing else).",1515110400,,622,4.5675675675675675

8681003,5,B00NXRG75E,"Rake, Series 3. In this megahit award-winning Australian television series, a legal dramedy, the bar has been lowered once again. Criminal barrister Cleaver Greene is back, as reckless, brilliant, self destructiveaddicted to alcohol, gambling, cocaine-- funny, bloody minded as ever. In this series Cleaver languishes in prison, convicted of manslaughter, facing the consequences of his crimes and misbehavioralthough hes actually not guilty of the particular crime for which hes serving time-- while he awaits the outcome of his appeal, handled by his acquaintance since university days, high-powered, once-and-possible-future lover, fellow barrister Scarlet.  When the conviction is quashed at last, Cleaver discovers his world has grown even more chaotic in his absence. The proliferation of Royal Commissions, inquiries and corruption trials requires so many barristers, even Cleaver can find work. Over the series, Cleaver Greene finds himself inadvertently at the heart of a billion dollar moral, political and criminal dilemma.

While in prison, Cleaver (Silver Logie award-winning Richard Roxburgh, Moulin Rouge!, Van Helsing) is surrounded by old enemies, including former State Attorney General Cal McGregor. And mob-boss Micks older brother George, who was also in love with Micks wife Kirsty, he now unofficially runs the penitentiary. After  Scarlet (Danielle Cormack, Wentworth) wins his appeal hearing, Cleaver is delighted to be released, immediately heads for a drug-fueled night of partying, but soon finds that things have changed since he went inside. Scarlet has opened her own practice; he will have to work for her. His best friend Barney, Scarlets husband, faces a startling medical diagnosis. And our boys already bad reputation has been seriously further damaged. Now even criminals don't want to be represented by him. Until following upon a botched robbery at the offices of casino mogul Tikki Wendon (Genevive Lemon, Top of the Lake), a corruption scandal overwhelms the business mogul and former A.G. McGregor (Damien Garvey, Jack Irish).  Finally,  Cleaver gets some new clients. Guest stars include Oscar and Golden Glove winning Aussie actress Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth, Blue Jasmine); Magda Szubanski (Kath and Kim), John Noble (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), Robyn Nevin (The Matrix films).

Acorn sent me an early release of this production so that I might render an honest review. The box set consists of three discs totaling approximately 463 minutes, plus bonus bloopers (5 mins.).  And subtitles of course, for those of us not comfortable with Oz-speak.  But beware: the entertainment contains mucho violence, strong language, nudity, drug use, sexual situations: definitely not family-friendly. And this comedy with a satiric edge can cut razor-sharp. Roxburghs anti-hero Cleaver, though it took me a while to warm to him  I was too surprised by his antics in the first series-- must be considered a whole-hearted, utterly convincing, complete comic character. The scripts are clever, biting; full of the social foibles of the day; of which they often take pleasure in presenting the contrarian view. And  Im stunned by the inventive daring of the unknown scriptwriters. I spent many a year watching Perry Mason in the good old days, and never saw a case remotely like the ones in which Cleaver specializes. Not for family viewing, but a dont-miss for anyone who can roll with its punches.",1505001600,,3447,5.438202247191011
8681004,5,B00NXRG75E,"Verified DVD review. Sydney law at its low point- but high on humor. Some plots episodic, reappear throughout -just when you thought it safe to forget.
Quote: Greene is a pathetic, alcoholic, drug-addled excuse of a man, a tragic example of everything gone wrong in the legal profession. Richard Roxburgh plays the character to perfection. Other cast characters also step up their neurotic behavior for another Series; proving all those millions of lawyer jokes are truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
Greene defends the lowest low-life. It makes for truly odd-often humorous law drama. Something to offend every viewer, via humor. Some good acting of people going rogue, and some notable guest stars too.
Greene is the Rake barrister leading great performances of a cohesive cast. Missy (Adrienne Pickering), Scarlet (Danielle Cormack -Wentworths Bea), Potter (Matt Day), Barney (Russell Dykstra), Sec Nicole (Kate Box), Wendy (Caroline Brazier), and this seasons new arrival Felicity (Jane Allsop).

8681005,5,B00NXRG75E,"Good fum, but some serious issues at times. I loved Mal and I wish he and Missy would get it together. I wasn't dying about the Felicity plotline. As bad as things get, he always triumphs. I have to say, he is a lot like my brother, with a lot more cocaine.  He always lands on his feet. The Barney and Scarlet story lines are quite touching. This season is different from previous ones-more characterization and personal drama, fewer court cases, but still a winner. I love Richard Roxburgh-he seems to have great chemistry with whoever he works with and his comic rants are second to none.",1503100800,,591,4.5233644859813085
8681006,1,B00NXRG75E,"I loved the first two seasons and was so disappointed in Season 3.  It was awful, absolutely awful.  It went totlly off the rails from the get-go, and not even Richard Roxburgh could save it.",1500422400,,191,4.428571428571429
8681007,5,B00NXRG75E,"I love this program.  Richard Roxburgh is just perfect in this role.  It is funny, and I love all the characters, even though they are all kind of deplorable.

Warning, lots of sex, some nudity.  This is not a wholesome, Disney-type movie.",1495238400,,239,4.619047619047619
