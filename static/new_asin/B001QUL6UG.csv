8336435,2,B001QUL6UG,"I purchased this opera (Admeto) as part of the Handel Festival Collection (http://www.amazon.com/Handel-Festival-Collection-Box-Set/dp/B00Q3FVW26/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1435111689&sr=1-1&keywords=handel+festival+collection) so this is a validated purchase.  I will include this review in both the box set and individual package.

We must begin by realizing that the foundation of opera is the composer being the interpreter of the work and not the librettist, actors, directors and even conductors.  The performers and director are supposed to bring out to the best of their ability the composers interpretation of the libretto.  This interpretation is music amplifying the meaning of the words and story in such a way as to communicate the art in a way that transcends the spoken word alone.

During the period in which Handel composed there was a constant issue concerning the actors imposing demands upon the score.  These demands served to highlight the technical achievements of the singer often at the expense of the composers intent.  Abuses led to practices that distorted the performance as to be absurd.  The music, carefully composed to fully bring out the words and action, was often performed in such a way as to deface, destroy and render unintelligible the musical interpretation.

Although Handel was famous he apparently had a hard time reigning in his singers.  Quality tenors and sopranos were apparently in short supply.  The castrati enjoyed great popularity and even political influence.  Castrated before puberty, those few who actually were successful after many years of cloistered intense training produced a unique powerful sound and achieved technical prowess that was unrivaled.  Having sacrificed so much to this barbarous practice their personal power and fame was a prime motivation.  This is not unlike the age of the great divas of the next century.

In our time counter-tenors have replaced the castrati and their craft has permitted revival of these wonderful operas.  We do not know what the castrati sounded like nor ever heard what they were able to achieve as far as technical expertise.  The counter-tenors sing in the alto range and often play principle male roles alongside sopranos, mezzo-sopranos and basses.  There is no tenor role in Admeto.

The counter-tenor sound is much different in texture, fullness and other qualities than the female alto.  The latter is more delicate.  The castrati apparently developed tremendous lung capacity and power due to the developmental shape of the thorax as a result of the castration.  The men singing alto can do so more powerfully and with a fullness that is simply foreign to our ears.

Frankly, it sounds a bit freakish and if you are listening to a CD it can get a bit confusing.  It is also a bit disorienting to watch a male hero, normally a tenor, sing alto.  It is just foreign to us and disorienting.  It is difficult, IMO, for the counter-tenor to convey the masculine heroism of these roles.  Yet these parts were often written for castrati and something about their art must have rendered authentic and effective the musical interpretation.  This is a great challenge for the modern counter-tenor and the audience.  I struggle with it.

The other difficulty modern audiences may find with these works in general is their style.  You often have a great classical Greek story here interpreted by a musical genius.  In the evolution of opera, the composers were attempting to recover the Greek ideal of music and theater they could only read about in ancient texts.  The tradition was lost by the prevention of direct intergenerational transmission in the Middle Ages and the music was never written down.  The artists had written descriptions of the achievements of that ancient art.

Greek plays reflected the Greek ideals and philosophy.  We are used to a more direct and popular expression of emotion and action.  The libretti often reflect the original Greek style of more abstract expression.  This fits with the dualism of Greek culture and the balance between the material and the ideal or spiritual.  Therefore the parts depicting action are words of intent and the arias or, when present, the chorus, are reflections of what is going on in a somewhat removed manner that may seem a bit cold and philosophical rather than raw emotional expression.
One can see the critical role of music in this stage of opera.  The emotional and transcendental content is amplified and mostly provided by the music and not the staged action and props.  The words are the stones upon which the fuller expression is formed.

At this stage of development we have a pattern of dry recitative in which the action is described and plot advanced followed by aria (or sometime a chorus) giving an interpretive reflection that may seem aloof.  The challenge for the modern audience, used to fuller, continuous music theater and grand productions, is to appreciate this art for its own brilliance.

So what happens in these modern productions?  There is evidently some attempt to bring forward the production in time to the effect of making the staging, dress and action more familiar.  I ask an important question.  Is the chief motivation behind these productions the inability of the audience to appreciate and give due attention to the opera in its original form or is it due to an inability or unwillingness of the artists to recreate that form in its fullness?  Perhaps it is both.

What we often have, as in this case, is a modern revival of the issue that plagued these composers in their lifetimes  performers taking over and distorting the work of a genius.  The abuses of some of the castrati are not the abuses of the directors.  They are taking liberties that go far beyond trying to bring the opera into a more familiar form.  They are doing many things that essentially change the entire work of art into something it is not.

I will say that this production is not as grotesque as many I have seen.  Other productions have resorted to nudity, sexually explicit vulgar acts and grotesque provocative props.  While this production does have some element of these tasteless forms they are mainly relegated to the scenes in Hades (a modern morgue) where Hermes is a cannibal feasting at an autopsy.

The modern staging here is that of a hospital with an operating room and medical props.  A brain MRI of the sick Admeto is projected on the backdrop (normal as best as I can tell).  The costumes are tacky, plastic looking and rob the characters of dignity.  There is also a large amount of miscellaneous action by extras busying themselves with tasks irrelevant to the opera itself.  This creates two problems: 1) it is a major distraction for the audience who should be paying attention to the acting of the one singing (indeed, the camera is often not on the singer but on these other actors)  and 2) it creates a parallel story line in pantomime that is irrelevant to what is supposed to be happening.

One can see the problem.  In addition to having three major elements of this operatic form that are foreign to modern audiences (the Greek classical style, the musical style of dry recitative/aria) and the sound of the counter-tenors, the audience is distracted by the visual goings on.
Further, despite what one may think of the staging and direction as far as taste, the focus leans heavily toward the material and away from the ideal.  This creates an imbalance in the dualism mentioned above.  The ideal is the higher expression in this art form and so much material expression undercuts it.  Thus, despite ones individual taste and mores, a strong argument can be made for interpretive failure on this basis IMO.

The challenge for the main singers is to bring out in expressive musical form that which Handel intends plus convey in acting through subtle actions and facial expressions what they are singing.  An audience cannot pay attention to both the main singers and the other action.  In this operatic form, it is the former that is most important and is the arbiter of how successful the performance is.

To that end I found, with exceptions, the singing and acting flat and short.  The best performance was by Romelia Lictenstein (Alceste) who put forth true effort and emotion into her performance.  Mechthild Bach was also good at times but she failed to fully develop the transformation from princess to veiled humble servant and then noble princess again.  She was unconvincing and part of this, IMO, lay in the costumes and staging which served to obscure this task.

The counter-tenors had quite a task and it is difficult to be hard on them because they are trying to reproduce something that is long lost and having to overcome an audience alienated from the operatic form in time and culture.  I noticed they wore mikes indicating a lack of force in their singing but this is not a failing alone given the circumstances.  I think they were undermined by the director and seemed lost as did the bass that played Hercules.

In addition, I found Howard Armans conducting and tempo a bit flat.  The music is busy and brilliant and more expressive than delivered here.  Perhaps that is personal taste.

I must admit that I have little against which to judge this performance.  I have not seen nor know of a performance produced faithful to what Handel intended.

Handel was a musical giant.  The stories upon which these operas are based have survived millennia and are timeless.  If Handel was not able to fully free himself of the castrati can we not do him honor by freeing him thus?  I believe this is a worse dishonor than Handel may have experienced in his lifetime and we owe it to him, and to opera, to attempt to reproduce Handels work and not distort it into something post-modern of our own.

Finally, guns appear in this opera.  I have seen too many productions with automatic weapons and other explosive devices and firearms that were not even dreamed about in the composers worst nightmare.  With due respect to the NRA, I favor a complete ban of automatic weapons in the traditional opera house .",1435017600,2,10137,4.9496743635287155
8336436,5,B001QUL6UG,"You get a first rate musical performance of one of Handel's most tuneful operas.  The blu-ray presentation is extremely fine.  As noted by the reviewer at blu-ray dot com, the variety of black levels are something you can't get on an ordinary DVD.  And then there is the very inventive comic pantomime that the performers engage in along with their singing duties. Two scenes were sensational:  There was Trasimede dressing Antigona as the huntress Diana, accompanied by some delicious hunting horn music, in Act I;  At the beginning of Act II, Hercules in a side splitting comic book manner takes over the reception room at Hades to rescue Alceste and some other unfortunate souls.  Once you get into this fascinating production, you don't mind the updating at all.  Handel done straight, with three and a quarter hours of da capo arias, is often a soporific experience.",1284422400,,871,4.924657534246576
8336437,3,B001QUL6UG,"The booklet accompanying this BD is much better than most and gives a good account of the plot and attempts at explaining the philosophy behind the staging adopted by countertenor/director Axel Kohler. The music is among the best composed by Handel and the artists involved in this product generally handle their roles well although I was less impressed with Melanie Hirsch as her voice was often overshadowed by others.

As with many Baroque operas, the plot is based on ancient myth and is not always easy to follow. So why add in the distractions of inappropriate costumes such as Hercules dressed in a shiny plastic black suit and props like a modern chromed hospital bed, a bright red delivery van and an aluminium suitcase? I can accept some modern settings of operas but it is just so far out at times in Admeto it destroys enjoyment and would seem totally unnecessary.

The cover blub proclaims ""Axel Kohler, the internationally renowned countertenor - now also famed for his work as a director - has brought Admeto into the modern era in timeless style by the skilful application of imaginative theatrical digressions. Kohler's production at the Halle Opernhaus revisits a work that encompasses comedy, tragedy and almost grotesqueness, couching it in the convincing metaphor of a modern hospital"".

Sorry but my reaction has centred mainly on the grotesque side of what is presented and find the metaphor of the modern hospital utterly unconvincing. Come on, how is resurrection from Hades by mythical characters convincing when the set revolves around a modern hospital bed? The plot is complex enough in Handel operas with women often playing men's parts in mythical stories which are even more unbelievable than most, and they certainly do not increase my enjoyment by ""moderisation"". Quite the contrary, I find it offputting.

These operas are long and I find need approaching an Act at a time, but I found this presentation particularly hard to enjoy. This is a pity because the artistry and music are very, very good. That music is very appropriately and skilfully handled by the Handel Festival Orchestra on historical instruments, conducted by Howard Arman.

So I differ with Robert in his enthusiasm for this disc and really cannot recommend it.

Having read them before I played the blu-ray version, I was surprised at how pleased I was.  The production is original and unusual, but I enjoyed it and felt it did not distract from the music.

I liked all the soloists, including counter-tenor Matthias Rexroth in the title role.

The audio and video quality are excellent (I played the DTS-HD soundtrack).  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Handel's operas.",1246147200,4,517,4.829545454545454
