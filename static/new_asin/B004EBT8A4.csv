After watching this video, I feel more at ease and confident that I can read what the means are. Would highly recommend this DVD.",1458691200,,267,4.583333333333333
8426649,5,B004EBT8A4,"This was really fresh and intelligent and kind of unexpected for me. It's not your everyday dream symbol kind of thing.  Its a much deeper, much lighter, and much more fluid way of looking at dreams. I don't like any heavy-duty psychoanalysis so I was happy not to find that here.  She (Jennifer Sieck) does a great job of explaining why we have the kinds of dreams we do, and tells how to literally feel what they mean versus analyzing them. Super helpful for getting out of ones head and enjoying dreamtime more, even when I have one that freaks me out. She even goes into how to kind of meld the wisdom of your dreams into your everyday life.  Really informative. Be sure to watch through to the very end, and watch more than once. Lots of good stuff.",1458604800,,754,4.371428571428571
8426650,5,B004EBT8A4,"I was very pleased with this DVD presentation. Whenever I watch DVDs, I want to be clear as to whether it serves an entertainment or an educational purpose. Many times I have been disappointed by slick graphic presentations with little or no content. Unlike those, this presentation helped me to learn. I took notes on this information packed program and had to rewind it several times just to ponder several wonderful point that Ms. Sieck made. This happened more than once.

I was pleased too, that this was not a generic program that only offered a one size fits all, simplistic answer for every symbol and sign that came up. Jennifer explained how the details can make the dream mean varying things. For instance, If two people had the same dream and one person had been mauled by dog and one had been saved by a dog: then that dream would have two entirely different meanings, despite what the best well intentioned book may say.

Ms. Seick prompted the audience to take internal notes, and in that way begin to listen to their intuition. I have been troubled by a reoccurring dream for a few years, as well as prompted by a powerful lucid dream experience. This DVD gave me unique tools to make sense of these different types of dreams and have comfort, closure and find direction.

Our dreams are individual and they will speak to us in a way we can uniquely understand them. Watching this presentation taught me how to recognize and listen to them more deeply and clearly. I believe the places of sleep, and waking as well as the place in between are all three equally real and connected; each type of awareness helps us make sense of the things in our lives that trouble us, that shape us and that challenge us. Sometimes we need to have quiet and listen to hear and see what our unique symbols are and what they are trying to convey to us.

Working with our dreams is not scary or macabre. Instead, they help us become more aware and use our senses more fully. These skills give anyone great raw material to begin with no matter where they are on their journey. I was surprised when the presentation was over because it did not seem like that much time had passed. I watch programs to improve my life, and add tools to my toolbox. I can say I found the information so engaging. I have wasted much valuable time and money on high tech glossy glitzy presentations that were sorely lacking in content and these were disappointing at best.

After watching, Dreamwork & Imaging: A Full Sensory Approach I had user-friendly tools I could work with. That is why this DVD is worth every one of the stars I gave it.

 I did purchase the Tarot Video by Ms. Sieck. I did not purchase this DVD but instead received it for review purposes; however I do believe and mean everything that I said in this review. Tidal Ashburn",1457222400,,2819,4.515686274509804
8426651,5,B004EBT8A4,"The presentation that is featured on this DVD shows what a powerhouse Jennifer Sieck is. Her affable demeanour immediately puts one at ease and facilitates a meaningful connection to better understanding some weighty concepts. What could have been a dry lecture on difficult and esoteric concepts instead comes across as a delightful friend sharing ideas with a passion for self discovery and growth.

During the hour Jennifer deftly transitions through a depth of topics with something here for anyone interested in working with dreams. She covers techniques for both working within the dream and waking worlds, exposing connections between the two states which can be explored to enrich our dreaming selves.

If you're completely new to this sort of thing, there is so much here for you. If you're a seasoned dream worker, she presents so many concepts that no doubt, something will either be new to you, or you'll think about it from a different point of view. The DVD rewards multiple viewings and just like in dream work, taking notes on what jumps out at you is incredibly helpful.",1456876800,,1087,5.0
8426652,5,B004EBT8A4,"Wow!  How often I forget to pay attention to the signals my dreams give me about where I am stuck!  Great video reminding me that where I am blocked in my waking life is often revealed to me in my dreams.  I really didn't understand Carl Jung's 'transcendent function' until Ms. Sieck described it or how much it can change your everyday life: having more energy and being more present and confident.  I am excited about using the tools that she's offered here, both in the dream state and while awake, to become more aware of and work through the issues that are really blocking me.  So often as adults in our society, we ignore our dreams.  I am so glad that I watched this video!  I plan on trying the plethora of tools that she has offered here to help me with some professional boundaries that I can't seem to surpass lately.  Thank you for reminding me that no one would know better than my inner unconscious self how to be more successful, feel more alive and more intuitive.  And thanks for the simple down to earth methods to remember my dreams and work with them!",1455926400,,1073,4.406091370558376
8426653,5,B004EBT8A4,"In the past, I have read and listened to multiple sources on the subject of dream work. However, I would always come away feeling intimidated by the message I had received. I was unable to follow these guides & instructions because I rarely remembered more than small snippets of information. This DVD suggests that even these small snippets are invaluable.

Ms. Sieck encouraged me to value & not dismiss small bits of remembered dreams, she also encouraged me to identify for myself what a given symbol means for me. Jenny's approach offers a simple to understand explanation of how the conscious and unconscious self connect through dreams. She does not endorse quick reference dream interpretations that are generic and can't possibly apply to everyone.

I found this DVD easy to understand, & equally accessible to beginners as well as experienced dreamers. Ms. Sieck suggests that I can value my own unique symbols & pieces at a core level.

I have never been encouraged to own my unique dream events, characters and symbols before. I now feel on track with my dream work after watching this DVD. As a result I am confident enough to begin listening to, and learning from my dreams as they lead me toward a deeper understanding of myself. This DVD was personally empowering. It offered me hope & excitement as I now feel much more, that I am the author of my own dreaming experience.",1296259200,,1389,4.803347280334728
