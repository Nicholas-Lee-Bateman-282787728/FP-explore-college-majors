7817644,1,6301928164,"I purchased this product in August as a gift for my Aunt from amazon. I gave it to her today (11/4/09 - still in original wrapping as rcvd), we sat down to watch it but the tape would not play. We tried several times but it looks like it is simply defective. we did try other tapes just to make sure it wasn't the VCR, and the other tapes played fine. I wish I would have seen her sooner because now it is too late to return the item. I have purchased items from amazon before and never had any problems, I am very dissapointed with this purchase.",1257292800,,547,4.074074074074074
