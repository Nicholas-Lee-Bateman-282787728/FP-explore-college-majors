8307249,2,B001GVJYKE,"This documentary said it took US forces forty years to ""subdue"" the Apache.  It analyzes two showdowns to address this phenomenon.  I am familiar with Custer's Last Stand, but I didn't know there were other incidents in which Native American nations were victorious over the newcomers.
Putting my militant cap aside, this work could have been about any battle.  It got boring looking at one used bullet after another and speaking of its significance.  There are few actual Apache interviewed here, sadly.  At one point, two men test whether arrows could be used faster than 19th-century guns.  If you know how slow the first guns were, you'd know the answer.  Much of this work went into depth about the obvious and this work just moved slowly period.
Like always, History Channel productions are filled with low-budget, cheesy reenactments.  The work interviews a scholar whose university is in the UK, yet his accent seems thoroughly Australian.  He never addresses his citizenship.
I am very interested in the issue of person-of-color unity.  The work said one battle was mostly fought by African-American soldiers.  I wonder what the Apache thought of their opponents and vice versa.  During the Vietnam War, many African Americans refused to participate saying, ""No Vietnamese ever called me a bleep-bleep!""  Did the Black man have hesitation about fighting the Red Man in the 1800s for a country that oppressed both groups?  I wish this could have been explored or that a viewer could make a work answering those questions.
This work spoke of war tactics more than culture or anthropology.  I think many viewers may prefer the ""American Experience"" episode about Geronimo over this work.",1251158400,,1693,5.083333333333333
