Finally, Def Poetry is presented in wonderful 16:9.  Its the only way us Australians can get it, and for an excellent price.  If you're even considering getting into Def Poetry, purcahse this DVD.

There are not (m)any special features and the seasons are quite short, but if you like the form you'll LOVE the DVDs.",1290211200,,366,4.338235294117647

3089181,4,B0012GVMH6,This helped me complete my collection of DEF POETRY.  Just as good as the other 5 seasons.

3089182,3,B0012GVMH6,"Def Jam Poetry Season 6 - has a lot of young poets who are just repeating the rythm and delivery of the poets that came before...very few of these 'artists'  are sharing new premises' or new voices..i get it, you were abused as a little girl, i get it, you're a brother from the ghetto, so your a king and you don't use racism as a crutch..and then use it as a crutch...and yes hip hop is dead. and it seems like if you do a wincing inhale during your delivery it equates to passion...and don't forget to walk out barefoot...i think some of these cats need to remember, that it isn't the dexterity of how fast you can spit, but the content of what you spit and the truth behind it...give me some pace and let the words absorb...its not gymnastics...its the skill to communicate your words.

Saddi Khali brings his game to the show and Shihan always brings it.... Vannesa Hidary [ Phd in Him }....George Clinton showing that he gets it...Black Ice is brilliant as usual...Beau Sia ,an incredible performer....Poetri...Suheir Hammad...Lemon...all do it the way it was meant to be done...and ironically all appear on the last show of this thin 2 disc set..no extras, bonus features....just 6 shows....

i'll advise to purchase the DVD, but only on the gorunds that if there is one voice to be heard, then its worth the buy...

3089184,3,B0012GVMH6,"Compared to the other seasons of Def Poetry, this DVD set is a rip off.  It costs more, but there are only 6 episodes.  In past seasons, they've managed to fit 6 episodes on one DVD, so I'm guessing that the only reason they split the season in to two discs was to make it seem like there's more content than there actually is.

Still, the performances during this season were incredible as always.",1212537600,4,398,4.351351351351352

8245890,5,B0012GVMH6,"Entertaining and thought provoking.  The episodes must be watched several times to appreciate the entire message the poets are conveying.  Some of the thoughts are so profound that at times one will stop listening to start to think about what was just said.  The more you think you know, the more you will learn.  If one is easily offended by the use of profanity they will miss the simple fact that words are used not only to convey ideas but also feelings.  The words are not to blame.  How we interpret their use is the issue.  If one is insensitive to what others think or are feeling then the words will serve no purpose and will fall on deaf ears.",1419206400,,653,4.391666666666667
