8618594,5,B00FTWJ1C2,"This is one of my favorite movies.  However despite a review I read before I purchased this, it does not play on blu ray player and I just recently bought mine.  It is a region B blu ray dvd.  So a warning to anyone else who buys this.",1411084800,,235,3.8541666666666665
8618595,1,B00FTWJ1C2,"Unfortunately, when I tried to play this disc in my Panasonic blu-Ray player, it came up with an error message saying that this disc would only play on a ""Region B"" player. I apparently don't have a Region B player here in the US. I really wanted to see this great movie in high def so I'm disappointed to have to return this disc. Maybe it works for some people, but it didn't work on my run of the mill blu-Ray player.",1410912000,,420,4.134146341463414
8618596,5,B00FTWJ1C2,"This review is for the fans like me who are still waiting for a US blu-ray.  Like others have posted, this blu-Ray will play on a Playstation 3 in the US.  There are special features that you will not be able to access, but if you own the DVD, then you have already seen them.  I didn't want to spend the money, but I have to watch this movie once a year, and I wanted to see an HD version this year.  So, I took the plunge.  I'm not totally sure if I made the right decision since I watch this on a 720p plasma with no home theatre set up.  But whatever, I love this movie.",1410652800,,574,3.8632478632478633
8618597,5,B00FTWJ1C2,"Look at that cast... What a great underrated fun sci-fi fun flick. And since it is a SCOPE WIDESCREEN movie, odds are you've never REALLY SEEN IT. (Without 40% of the screen missing on TV).
What a joy to watch again in this nice transfer, with lots of extras.
It's Sci-fi in the vein of MIB, if you need a comparison. It's a little weird, but in a really good way!
Watch for the iconic end credits (that have been copied many times, most notably by Wes Anderson's LIFE AQUATIC).
And, hey, Where's our BUCKAROO BANZAI VS. THE WORLD CRIME LEAGUE sequel you promised?!!!",1409356800,,567,4.461538461538462
8618598,5,B00FTWJ1C2,"Like other reviewers said, the German Blu ray version us just fine for English viewers. In fact, it's the best looking version I've seen including the initial theatrical release where the print was already beat up.

And remember: no matter where you go, there you are.",1401494400,,268,4.826086956521739
8618599,5,B00FTWJ1C2,"Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU to Koch Media! I've been waiting for this to be released in Hi-Def since the advent of the Hi-Def format. Ordered the reasonably-priced German release from M+L in Germany, and it got to me in the SoCal desert in only nine days.

On the back of the BD's case, it only shows a Region-B symbol... not an all-region A-B-C symbol. Same for the disc itself. I tried it in my hardware-modified Oppo BDP-103 on each of the three regional settings, and it plays perfectly on all of them.

Yet another all-time cult classic that I'd give ten stars to, if I could!",1400457600,3,585,4.407407407407407
8618600,5,B00FTWJ1C2,Awesome to see old Buckaroo Banzai on Bluray. The German deal is totally negligible. It's some crazy copyright BS but if you are a Buckaroo fan like me than go for it![...],1399507200,2,172,4.40625
8618601,5,B00FTWJ1C2,Number One of my favorite cult films of the 1980's.  All i want to know is will this play in a Region A player,1397779200,2,110,3.5833333333333335
8618602,1,B00FTWJ1C2,"$42??? Are you out of your mind?  Sure, it may very well be the best movie ever made, but I only have $22 to spare right now and I still don't have the full set of MST3000.  What the heck do you want me to do?
Going to bed sad tonight.  Your fault.

$13 and it's back to 5-stars.",1397001600,3,282,3.6666666666666665
