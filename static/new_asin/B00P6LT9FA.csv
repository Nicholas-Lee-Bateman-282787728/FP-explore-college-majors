6787829,2,B00P6LT9FA,"The reviews led me to believe that I was buying a potential classic, maybe it is for some, but I was totally bored by this movie even the quality animation didn't keep me glued . I will stick to the classic 80's and 90's Anime among with the recent Ghost in the Shell productions",1444003200,3,279,4.185185185185185

6787834,5,B00P6LT9FA,"Got my copy from the Kickstarter the publishers ran so I can post before the release date honestly.

I loved this movie. Very thoughtful look at androids, AI and human perception of them. Very well done. I listened to the English voice track and it seemed fine.",1428278400,7,261,4.553191489361702
6787835,4,B00P6LT9FA,"This movie has an unusual plot line.  It takes place in the future where androids are commonplace and are very human-like.  Out in the public, they are seen as subservient slaves and can be distinguished by a halo above their heads.  A boy discovers their android seems to go off on its own to a cafe called Eve.  Curious as to why the android would go to such a place, he enlists the aid of a friend and goes there.

They discover that androids and humans mingle at the cafe without knowing who is an android or human as the androids turn off their halos.  They also discover that androids are more human-like with feelings when given that freedom.

The graphics quality is excellent.  The backgrounds are very detailed and well drawn.  The characters themselves are drawn more human-like as well instead of the atypical manga style.  Sound is clear but not notable as it is mostly dialog driven.

Overall, the story is very good and very thought provoking.  A very good movie that I can easily recommend...",1426377600,24,1008,4.601123595505618
6787836,5,B00P6LT9FA,It's a beautiful movie. Great direction before Patema Inverted. I watched the whole movie that I enjoyed.,1421020800,6,105,5.235294117647059
8686528,5,B00P6LT9FA,"One of the best narratives about the possible eventuality about how humans and machines will interact when machines are built to look like humans. Also, the soundtrack is very good.",1522195200,,181,5.066666666666666
8686529,3,B00P6LT9FA,"Ive mixed emotions.  It had some touching parts that make you actually care about robots.  That said, it has some stupid points and seems to drag a bit.  I expected a great movie and I got an ok movie.  Id say its worth $20 but not more than that.",1520467200,,247,3.979591836734694
8686530,5,B00P6LT9FA,"This is a great edition of a great film about AI and the possible moral complications that could arise from a society comprising of humans and robots living together.

Its a well directed film too with great use of camera angles that aren't usually seen in most animated films and the soundtrack fits really well and its included in this collectors edition Blu-Ray along with well designed packaging and an excellent bonus book that delves into the design of the movie and soundtrack with a great story at the end.
All in all I really recommend this International Release Deluxe Edition Blu-Ray and its a film that anyone interested in animated movies or just great movies in general should own or at least watch.
Also, all Blu-Rays should be region free as sometimes the extras you get in one country aren't the same as in another and I feel thats unfair (American and Japanese releases of Anime especially are generally of much higher quality and thats possibly due to the ridiculous charges made by the U.K. BBFC for extras - 6 for each minute of extras to the actual film! And usually the packaging and physical extras are massively better, just look at Amagi Brilliant Parks collectors edition to see what I mean).",1519862400,,1219,4.723004694835681
8686531,5,B00P6LT9FA,"This is a must have for any Anime fan, ranking up there with the Studio Ghibli movies and Paprika as a must own for anyone who enjoys anime.

If you are looking for a gift for your son/daughter/friend etc... who loves anime, check their shelf. If they do not own this, then look no further. You must buy this for them, I can not exclaim how high quality the animation and production value is on this movie. Everyone should sit down and watch this movie at least once.",1494720000,2,467,4.306818181818182
8686532,5,B00P6LT9FA,"Great movie

Here's a list of some of the things I enjoyed with this movie:

1. No fan-service
2. You learn something from watching
3. Very funny moments
4. Interesting plot",1489449600,2,173,4.548387096774194
8686533,5,B00P6LT9FA,"This is a very thoughtful look into AIs, robots and androids, the three laws of robotics, and how machines and humans might get along in the early days of the relationship.  This is not a dumbed down cartoon sit-com, but rather a tale of machines interacting with humans in a caf which permits no discrimination between humans, robots or androids.  The discrimination includes self identifying as a machine, so all the patrons act and claim to be human.  Part of the fun is figuring out who is a machine and who is a human.  The gripping part is that it is all believable.

Current actual predictions under Moore's Law are that by 2034, a desktop computer will have the capacity of the human brain.  One and a half to two years later, that desktop will have twice the capacity of the human brain.  Thinking machines are coming (once the software catches up with the hardware), so this topic will be relevant in the not so far future.",1459296000,2,933,4.550898203592815

8686536,5,B00P6LT9FA,"Gorgeous art, engaging story and setting, excellent voice acting. I will definitely be watching for other works by Yasuhiro Yoshiura. While the feature is well worth the price alone, I also enjoyed the two other short films, Pale Cocoon and Aquatic Language, generously included in this release (Pale Cocoon, in particular, was brilliant). The inclusion of the sound track was a very welcome touch, making this a must buy.",1456272000,2,422,5.130434782608695
8686537,5,B00P6LT9FA,"I got to watch Time of EVE the movie on crunchy roll for free and it was really enjoyable to watch. I definitely had to get the blue ray version. I wish there was more to come, it will definitely make you want more. I've always enjoyed positive stories about androids and the Time of EVE is one of them.",1445385600,4,303,4.066666666666666
