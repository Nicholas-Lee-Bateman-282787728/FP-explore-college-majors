7827408,1,6302530946,Movie started out with potential.  Anthony Perkins definitely knows how to play a tortured soul and serial killer.  But there was no explanation really as to why he was killing and the ending was really bad.  I would not recommend anyone watch this.,1405036800,,249,4.744186046511628
7827409,3,6302530946,"Anthony Perkins was and is a great Actor. This film would have been much better with more of MR Perkins in it. The best scenes by far have him in them. The presence of MR Perkins warrants three (3) stars and HIS scenes are five (5) or whatever the highest rating is, of course. The film is for MR Perkins fans only. Without him it is a one (1) or such such such etc.......",1387843200,2,372,4.04054054054054
7827410,2,6302530946,"Having read Michael Simkins's superbly entertaining and very funny book about his life as an actor (""What's My Motivation?"") I wanted to see this movie because he describes how he played his minor part in it, with a phoney Irish accent that managed to fool the German director. To Simkins's disappointment it didn't launch him into a successful movie career and instead, this movie went straight to video and even his agent had difficulty finding a copy. I see from the opening and closing titles that they even got his name wrong and he is billed as Michael Simpkins. Anyway it would be a reasonable late night movie to watch on cable but it is deeply flawed. The script is leaden and full of cliches. I don't know what decade they were aiming for, but it feels like the 1950s with furnished rooms in a dingy area of North London yet there is a 1980s Toshiba laptop computer in several scenes. Anthony Perkins delivers a quality performance, of course, but none of the other performances are better than mediocre, probably because of the very poor directing. There are worse films that have made it to DVD so perhaps this deserves a wider audience.",1313798400,,1149,4.665024630541872
7827411,3,6302530946,"Made in Germany and England in 1991 this was the great Anthony Perkins' last cinema role (his last film role was in the 1992 TV movie ""In the Deep Woods""). Here again he plays another demented paranoid Norman Bates type killer who goes off the deep end once again when his beloved mannequin is taken away from him. It dosen't help when it was his namesake, downstairs in tha apartment block that was responsible for this.
Anthony Perkins deserved better than this, but as usual his presence makes the movie worth while.",1074384000,4,519,4.6521739130434785
