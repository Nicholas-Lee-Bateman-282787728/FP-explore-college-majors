7902964,4,B000003KAC,"I really enjoyed this episode of Voyager and feel that it represents a real turning point in the character development of The Doctor.  In this episode, The Doctor first saves the life of, then falls in love with a Vidiian woman who is seriously afflicted with the Phage.
What I really enjoy about the episode is the ""new ground"" that the character of The Doctor is breaking with his exploration of human love and desire.  This is a significant step forward in the overall character development of The Doctor, and Robert Picardo does some excellent acting in this episode as well.  I give it 4 stars.",996624000,,599,4.632075471698113
