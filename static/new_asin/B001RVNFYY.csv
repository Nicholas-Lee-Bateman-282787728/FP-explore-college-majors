8339038,5,B001RVNFYY,"I've been wanting to see ""Blue Remembered Hills"" for just about ever, and tonight I finally got my chance. Dennis Potter was an absolute genius!

Helen Mirren is lovely in this, and totally believable as a 6 (or so) year-old girl. The trick of using adult actors to play children never seems gimmicky -- all of the actors carry off their characters so well that we often completely lose sight of the fact that they're grown-ups. Meanwhile, because they *are* grown-ups, they're able to tap into a lot of nuance that child actors would be unable to embrace.

Because it's Potter, we just *know* something bad is going to happen, but when it does it's not what we've been expecting, and it's somehow far more horrifying than whatever it is we think we've prepared ourselves for.

Highly recommended.",1323648000,3,797,4.760869565217392
