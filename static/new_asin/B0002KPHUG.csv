8028353,5,B0002KPHUG,"Obviously it's not a happy story, but it lets you ponder how ordinary people can be evil as well as the fatal bond between the father and the son. The last scene was incredibly powerful and I was extremely touched by such complexed feelings of the boy toward his father.
The actors did  great job.  Especially The pathetic father played by Ken Ogata, the two demoniac women played by Mayumi Ogawa and Shima Iwashita.
One of the greatest films!!",1390867200,3,444,4.6075949367088604
8028354,4,B0002KPHUG,"This is a well told, well acted story of alienation and jealousy and attatchment.  I don't really want to say anymore, as there are a lot of things that happen and change as the film goes on, and I don't like spoilers.

I would not exactly describe it as a suspense story or a whodunnit, which I think I saw written somewhere.  But it has a little mystery to it, and you stay transfixed.  Iwashita Shima is beautiful as always.",1389052800,3,427,4.3
8028355,5,B0002KPHUG,"if by family movie one understands not some sugary concoctions and saccharine eulogies of ""family values"" that don't exist anymore, but an honest probing of questions like responsibility, father-son relationships, motherhood, modern family life. Outstanding! This is not a horror movie. There's no blood in it. But if you like Dostoevsky you have to see it. And don't, by any means, miss Nomura's ""Zero Focus."" That's a masterpiece!",1324598400,5,432,5.367647058823529
8028356,5,B0002KPHUG,"This is truly a disturbing film. Not in the traditional sense though. There is no blood/gore or sex, or even typical movie violence. What there is, however, is a horrible look at parenting and/or lack thereof(please don't think of Flowers in the Attic and give up on this. There is no comparison). If you like movies that suck you in and don't leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling, check this one out.",1136160000,18,404,4.472972972972973
