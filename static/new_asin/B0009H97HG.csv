Hearing Florabelle call for her son while pushing her shopping cart in New York City is enough to bring you to tears.  I was very moved.  If you didn't already know Lucille Ball was a dramatic actress, you are in for a suprise!",1121904000,48,320,4.56140350877193
2290382,5,B0009H97HG,"The great Queen of Comedy gave one of her greatest dramatic performances just a few years before her death.  Lucy plays Florabelle, an aging, but streetwise, veteran of the streets of Manhattan.  Filmed during the emerging homeless crisis of the Reagan years, this TV movies presents how the malady had spread to the lower working class and the mentally disabled.  The problem continues to this very day, too.  The ending is a bit unbelievable, but heartwarming.  We all miss you--and love you, Lucy.  Many thanks for the laughs and tears.",1121212800,15,539,4.933333333333334

2290403,4,B0009H97HG,"If you lived in New York City in the 1970s and 1980s as I did, you are aware of the homelessness situation, which included bag ladies and lots of people sleeping under the West Side Highway. This film takes place in 1985 when the city was at crisis levels (we are actually in worse shape now with homelessness and bad leadership in New York City, but thats another story altogether). But back to Stone Pillow  the term stone pillow was a term for sleeping on the sidewalk, which was (and is) very common in New York City. I worked as a writer for almost two years at a homeless services agency and the reasons for homelessness are many and the ability to provide services is also very complex with layer upon layer of issues, including changing the way the people in the underserved community think and feel. From their life experience, its often hard to believe that things can or will change or that you deserve better. There is also fear. Which brings me back to Lucille Ball in her last performance. This was a made-for-TV movie (I saw it when it was on TV but came across it again when researching available Lucille Ball titles after my trip to Jamestown this summer) and it showcases her talent in dramatic roles  something we are not used to seeing her in. This was actually her last role before her death in 1989 (I think  if I read that right when I was up in one of the museums in Jamestown).

After I Love Lucy, I think it was hard for both Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance to regain footing in any type of dramatic roles. Lucy was a comedic genius and Vivian Vance was a thespian so she went back to the theatre and Lucy carried on with the Lucy shows and a few other projects. This film was a real departure from her past roles and that helps to make it memorable and meaningful.

As a woman who has lost her home and family  including a son, Florabelle has carved out a little niche for herself on the streets and she has found ways to survive  how to get food, where to find water, who the folks are that look out for her. But things take a downhill shift when a young woman (in the social work area, played by a very young Daphne Zuniga) meets Florabelle on the streets and throws a monkey wrench into the works. Florabelle, not knowing who this young woman is, takes her under her wing and tries to teach her the ways of street life. But she teaches her about much more than street life and the young woman is determined to help Florabelle get off the streets, out of danger and into a safe home of her own. Of course, Florabelle is at first resistant to change but after a series of calamities on the street, she realizes that she must move on from the life she is leading.

The ending is a little bit disappointing  but only the last scene, which seems contrived with Florabelle playing in the dirt of her new home. But the rest of it is definitely worth seeing just to get an idea of what street and shelter life was (is) like (not much has changed, believe it or not) and to see Lucy in a vastly different role than you could ever expect. This is available for purchase as a digital download on Prime.

\

We all love Lucy. However this dramatic film was not the best of Ms Ball. She takes a turn as a bag lady in New York. This dramatic turn felt forced. Her character of Horabella is developed well in the hands of George Schaeffer, but it is not suitable for Ms Ball. Drama is not her strong suit, I don't feel she had the acting chops to pull this off.

Daphne Zunigma (Spaceballs) alsdo seemed out of her depths in this drama. She tends to pander to Ms Ball rather than acting besider her

All the whole it isn't great, but a TV movie  of the 1980s, it still holds up and is more timely than ever

Homelessness is an unwarranted travesty in this country.

It's been many years since I've seen this very dramatic side of Lucy & I remember vividly how this particular movie made me CRY my eyes & heart out, after seeing her for so man years in silly, comedy episodes since I was very little.. so this DVD just broke my heart, & to have heard it was her very last performance, it hurt even more, so YES, I have seen it twice on TV, am NOT writing a review on something I have not seen before; please don't get me wrong!  I also enjoyed Daphne Zuniga's (from Melrose Place, etc.)  character in this movie; very touching as a social worker trying to help LUCY get off the streets, etc.. can't really remember all the details, since it's been years since I have seen this, but am anxiously awaiting its arrival in my mailbox!  STELLAR FINAL PERFORMANCE BY LUCILLE AS A BAG LADY ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK!! (hurt my heart & made me cry, seeing her like that, as I've never seen her before...

2290486,4,B0009H97HG,"I had not seen this movie before but have seen Lucille Ball in a couple of her early career movies showing she has talent beyond the slapstick humor she is most famous for. Personally, I give Ms. Ball a 5 star rating all around.

This movie was well-acted with excellent direction (George Schaefer) depicting homeless life on the streets of New York. It was a little slow in some respects but never lost its focus and rhythm. It starts with a young social worker (Daphne Zuniga) wanting to learn and understand the homeless to better help them. She (Zuniga as Carrie) meets Flora (Ms. Ball) who thinks Carrie is a runaway and wants to help her learn to live safely on the streets of New York. Carrie goes to extremes with Flora and they closely bond. There's more to watch and absorb from this movie but I will let you enjoy this yourself.

Anyway, I got very emotional with the content of this movie and learned there is a lot more we can do to help and direct those in need to obtain services to make their lives a little bit better. I hope to do more and hope those in need will also accept and make use of these resources.

Overall, this is a good movie to see and have for future young viewers to soak up.",1400284800,,1210,4.298245614035087

2290498,5,B0009H97HG,"I watched ""Stone Pillow"" when it first aired on TV, many years ago. I truly loved it. I honestly believe that Lucille Ball was the perfect person for the role, and I don't think any other actor/actress could have portrayed the character as accurately, or with such true depth as Lucille. She emersed herself in the role so well, that it made the viewer believe that she truly knew, what it was like...what it meant, to be homeless. Almost as if she, herself, had been homeless at some time in her life. This was not only one of Lucille's last films made, but I have never seen her play a more serious role. She really outdone herself with this one. She truly excelled in this heart-felt performance.
  I have been searching for a copy of this film since it's first airing, but always got the response of it being a ""made for TV only"" film & was not available for public sale.
  I was elated to find ""Stone Pillow"" now available for purchase. This is a ""Must See"" film. I highly recommend it to all.",1386460800,,998,4.378378378378378

For it was, without a doubt, in this fan's mind, one of her most excellent modern-day performances ever to be put to her credit!!  It showed that even towards the end, Ms. Ball still showed her strenght and tenacity for putting all she had, (which was always her best), in making a very strong and poignent character come to life on the screen.

2290533,5,B0009H97HG,"Working out of the confines of her comedic skills Lucille Ball starred in this rare dramatic CBS TV-movie way back in 1985 playing a homeless woman living on the streets of New York City. The film shows how a person can end up on the streets and what needs to be done to help those who are homeless.

 Lucille Ball proved she was an incredible actress in this forgotten movie. When I originally watched this I had forgotten that she was indeed the ""Queen of Comedy"", a true indication that Lucy was indeed an actress who could make her fans forget her past roles and concentrate on watching the film.

 Shooting took place on the streets of New York City during the summer of 1984, one of the hottest summers in the Big Apple. In order to give the role justice Lucy wore a wig that made her look less than beautiful, oversized coats that made it look like the movie took place in the winter (when it was actually shot in July) and make-up that made people not even recognize Lucy. During a break in filming Lucy went to a nearby restaurant to eat (in full makeup and clothing) and at the door she was told to leave by the staff as they thought she was a real homeless person.

 Immediately after filming Lucy was hospitalized with severe dehydratation as she lost 30 lbs from sweating during the intense heat. We nearly lost her.

 When I watch the film (which is not all that much because I do get depressed) I really have an affinity of hatred toward the producers for getting Lucy to make this movie. Knowing Lucy was well past 70 they should have never got her to do it and if they wanted her that much the filming should have been done at a cooler time of the year. Also, with the success of ""Stone Pillow"" ABC took notice as did Aaron Spelling and decided television audiences wanted Lucy back on weekly television and rewarded her with a terrible sitcom in the fall of 1986 called ""Life With Lucy"". The series was a complete flop, panned by critics and fans alike and cancelled after only a handful of episodes made it to air. When being interviewed by friend Joan Rivers on Fox's ill-fated ""The Late Show with Joan Rivers"" Lucy replied (in reference to her show being axed), ""They didn't want me anymore"". Less than three years later Lucy died.",1349654400,,2252,4.4227053140096615
2290534,5,B0009H97HG,"Lucy gives her best dramatic performance here.  It is filmed right on the street of New York and it is so realistic you forgot this is just a movie.  Lucy gives her soul to Flora and is believable as a homeless person.  This reveals the harsh realities of life with enough grit without explicit details.  You feel sorry for Lucy sad after a son taken away by her seperated husband and her distain of charity givers.  The nastiness of some of them shows how some can be heartless compared to others.  This exposes the harshness of our culture and should move us to be more loving, understanding and kind to all in words and deeds.",1348876800,,629,4.426086956521739

2290545,5,B0009H97HG,"Florabelle (Lucille Ball) lives on the streets of New York City. She's been homeless so long that she knows where it's safe, where it's not safe and where it'll be the warmest on a cold night. She keeps to herself and doesn't want anybody in her business. She pushes around a shopping cart filled with her things and if anyone dares to touch what belongs to her that person is in for a fight. Florabelle finds companionship (although she fights against it for a while) when she meets Carrie Lang (Daphne Zuniga), but then a truth comes to light and it looks like Florabelle may be on her own once again.

I usually watch shows with Lucille Ball because I know she'll make me laugh and I always appreciate a good laugh. Lately, though, I've watched classic movies she starred in and it was nice to see the dramatic roles she played in her younger days. Her performance in Stone Pillow made me laugh at times, but mostly it saddened me. I felt for Florabelle, especially when she ended up in a place she didn't choose to go. She wasn't happy about the situation and neither was I.

Florabelle was a woman without an address and she had very little money but she knew how to make it on the streets. Some may have thought she was a little off but she had her right mind. In fact, she was an intelligent woman. She was a quick thinker and she knew how to get what she needed when she needed it. She was feisty and capable of taking care of herself. Florabelle was a survivor! I felt bad about her situation but I loved her spunk.

Stone Pillow was heart-touching. There are definitely important lessons to be learned from watching this 1985 television movie. One lesson in particular: It is never too late to make a change.

Also, I didn't realize Ana Maria Horsford (Thelma Frye on Amen may be her most remembered role; she's been acting since the 70's) was in this movie. It was nice to find that out.",1270512000,,1898,4.398860398860399
2290546,5,B0009H97HG,"The movie was originally supposed to be a Christmas present. I ordered from a seller on ebay and they lost the movie in the mail and ended up getting it back at their warehouse. They refused to reship or refund my money so I came to Amazon to buy it. I bought from this seller and due to a change of address I was undergoing, the movie got sent back to them too. (That was not the reason for the trouble with ebay.) When I explained this to the seller through an email once they contacted me letting me know they had gotten it back, it was reshipped and I still got it before the estimated shipping date. I didn't get it in time for Christmas by any means, but it was all right because this seller was so wonderful to work with.",1264809600,,728,4.0979020979020975

2290550,5,B0009H97HG,"This made for TV movie was Lucille Ball's final film and she wanted to make a serious statement. Not everyone realizes she was a serious actress and starred in a number of movies before making her fame as I LOVE LUCY. This is a story about age and youth, about street-wise and naivete, about someone who has no hope and someone who wants to change the world. This is a story about Florabelle, a homeless woman, who 'owns' her corner in New York City. Everything she has is in her grocery cart. The merchants on her corner know her and help her. She knows the ways of the street. She's a survivor. It's also the story of Carrie, fresh out of college in her first job as a social worker in a woman's shelter. She's told to go interact with people on the street to better understand them. She meets Florabelle who thinks she's a runaway and tries to show her the ways of the homeless. She takes her underground and into the dark world of living on the street where you survive by your wits and with some help from your friends. Lucille Ball was a great actress and she 'Carries' the day in this outstanding film about what it's like to be one of millions of people living on the street. There's nothing comic about this movie and the serious message it had back in 1985 is perhaps even more appropriate today. As someone once asked the most famous rabbi of all, 'who is my neighbor?' This film will help to define who our neighbors are. As Carrie said near the end, 'how can I stay warm when you're cold'. How do we manage to stay warm when so many are living in the cold? This one may prick your conscience as it did mine. Available for immediate play on Netflix. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews.",1238803200,4,1685,4.30188679245283

Lucille Ball is a wonderful actress - and this just puts the cherry on top of her wonderful career sundae. She's both light-hearted but heartfelt in her portrayal - and most of all - she gives her character truth and depth.

You want a great movie that isn't just a ""chick flick"" or a ""Dude's dream""? This is it - it will effect everyone - young and old - and give them a more compassionate look at the lives of AMERICA'S ignored population.",1174867200,19,757,4.073825503355705

2290562,5,B0009H97HG,"This movie from 1985 was the last movie performance of Lucille Ball before her death in 1989. When it was filmed, Ball, who's early drama career became pretty much forgotten because of the name she made for herself in slapstick comedy, stated that she made this film so her public would not just remember her as a dizzy redhead. She wanted to be remembered as an actress who could play virutally any role, and that she could! This in my opinion was her greatest dramatic role. This is not the Lucy America knew as a coniving, scheming redhead who always managed to get into something she had to find a way out of. This is a whole new dimension of Lucille Ball. Grey haired, head lice, dirty, down and out with no social status, her character is a bag lady who has hit the absolute bottom living on the streets of New York City and struggling to survive. An outstanding performance on her part, in this ""made for TV"" drama. Her rendition of the bag lady Florabelle, will certainly make you stop and think about homelessness. After all, Everyone loves Lucy. When you see someone you have loved for half a century, now aged and homeless, it hits home. In addition to Lucy, Daphne Zuniga also gives a shining performance as the young social worker who sets out to get Florabelle off the streets and into a home of her own to live out what remaining years she has. The problem is that Florabelle has been on the streets for years and knows no other way of life. You will be enthrolled as you watch to see how it will all end. Very good quality all the way around. If you are a diehard Lucy fan, You HAVE to see this movie. If it's not in your Lucy collection, you don't have one. I highly recommend this film.........",1163635200,15,1712,4.386792452830188
2290563,4,B0009H97HG,"Before she was ""Lucy"", Lucille Ball was a Hollywood workhorse, starring in dozens of dramatic films. Here, in one of her last performances, she shows what a gifted actress she really was. Unfortunately the script is terrible- both maudlin and hackneyed, offering no insight into the real problem of homelessness. Costar Zuniga is also very weak.

2290565,4,B0009H97HG,This movie was the great Lucille Ball's second to last performance of a legendary career.  This is a somber film in that it shows what it is like for the homeless not only for those who live on the streets of the large citys but the smaller ones as well.  Lucy gave a sharp performance as an elderly street person and Danaphe Zunige likewise as the compassionate social work.

Not Many Actress's would take such a risk but then again Lucille Ball always was a Trailblazer! Lucy of course was always known as a Comedic actress but she proves in this film that she is just as able in a Hard Hitting Drama! I Live in a Big City(LA) and I see homeless people everyday and it is so easy for people to take them for granted . After watching this film, one has a Whole new Perspective on the Homeless problem(which has grown even worse since bush jr took office)  and the people who experience it .

2290569,4,B0009H97HG,"This movie is a must for any fan of Lucille Ball's work.  Especially those who have only seen her masterful comedic talents.  ""Stone Pillow"" was a chance for her to show her dramatic acting chops -- and boy does she have them!

This 80's TV movie was probably one of the first to tell the story of the homeless, and it was also one of Lucy's last roles.  I had seen this on TV, and taped it; but for some reason or other I probably hadn't viewed it in close to a decade.  I was thrilled when the DVD came out.

The quality of the image and sound are probably close to what you'd find on other TV movies of its age.  It's far better than the one I taped off TV in the early 90's.

While not overly gritty, the film tries to show the reality of a bag woman, and I think it succeeds.  It's a real treat to watch Lucille Ball shine in the role of Florabelle, and I recommend this DVD to all of her fans.",1125964800,11,899,3.95

Lucille Ball's performance is steller in this made-for-TV movie and a great showcase for the talent that the world usually associates with her comedic routines from her days in ""I Love Lucy"".  She draws the audience into her plight and sympathy is garnered, possibly through her celebrity fame, for her character of Florabelle.

Lucy had a difficult time in making this movie due to the heat of New York City while wearing her street wardrobe.  She suffered dehydration and at the age of 74 suffered several minor strokes.  With all this, she never let her performance suffer in this ""Must-Have"" movie!  Concidently, Lucy's character, Florabelle, was named after her real-life grandmother!

If you're a Lucy Fan - you MUST get this movie as an honor and tribute to the final movie performance from one of the greatest Red-Heads that ever existed!",1124064000,48,1090,4.885869565217392

It was a priviledge, but tearful experience to watch, and I had to wait some 20 years before the release of the film on DVD was realised.
