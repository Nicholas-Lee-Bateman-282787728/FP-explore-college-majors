8099437,5,B000CNER0O,"I first saw this from a library DVD loan. It was so good that I set out to buy it and put it in my personal library.  It IS a good movie on lions, and it in particular follows a certain pride of lions on an African reserve. I must have watched it five or six times in a row when I first got it from the library (Five or six times that night). Now I have ordered it.

I am very particular about the nature/wildlife movies I buy.  I try to get the ones that have good, quality color, good text on the subject, that is exciting and holds your attention, shows the true life and pattern of the animal, that while it does show that the animal must hunt in order to eat (it cannot go to McDonalds and order a salad to go) but at the same time, that part is not too gory, the narration does not promote evolutionist ideas (Animals did not evolve and our great, great grandparents did not come from orangatangs), does not elevate the animal kingdom as if they are on a higher plane than humans, while bashing mankind as the ""enemy of animal's existance and habitat"", etc... and this movie is an EXCELLENT documantary that leaves all that stuff out and just gets you intimately aquainted with this particular African pride of Lions and their life and experiences.

You will like this movie. Still not sure? Do what I did and get it from the Library, look at it and see that it's a great movie, then you will confidently go out and buy it too.",1210809600,18,1433,4.2
8099438,3,B000CNER0O,"I don't regret purchasing this dvd and have watched it several times. Unfortunately the commentary on most wildlife films ranges from insipidly trite to downright annoying - this seems criminal, given the quality of the movie footage and the tribulation involved in capturing it. On this one the monologue is mostly innoffensive.

Although the quality during the introduction has the appearance of an old video, the rest of the film is fine. While not in the same league as, say, Derek & Beverey Joubert, there is some memorable and engaging footage in places and I will certainly be watching it again.",1188950400,8,602,4.96039603960396
