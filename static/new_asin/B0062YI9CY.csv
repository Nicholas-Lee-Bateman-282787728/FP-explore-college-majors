8491547,2,B0062YI9CY,"The plot is based on the story by Kurt Held (Kurt Klaber) with the same name. It is a story of a gang of kids lead by Zora in Croatia.  The story was very popular in its time. A movie by Peter Kahane in 2007 was based on the same story.
The problem with this production is not the story, it is the music and mostly, the staging.  The music, although having some nice tunes, does not have WOW moments, too many styles of music. The lyrics are almost void of emotions, just very short sentences.  The staging can be annoying, it seems the stage director wanted to prove that the singers can be running all the time.  They keep running from one side to the other, which is difficult to follow and makes lots of unnecessary noise on the stage. The staging has some inventive ideas, but as a whole it doesn't work. May be, with a different staging, my overall impression could have been better.",1371427200,2,889,4.3053892215568865
