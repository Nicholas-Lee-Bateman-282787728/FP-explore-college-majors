1153991,5,7885887049,"A very pleasant surprise! An extremely interesting event from WWII, unknown to me as an American.  British audiences may be more familiar with it.  Although the main character is not the best actor I've ever seen, the movie still holds up, and the action scenes are great, especially for a movie from the 1950's.  What surprised me the most, was the pace of the movie.  Not a dull, slow moment anywhere.",1357344000,,403,4.633802816901408

1153993,5,7885887049,"Excellent bio drama of Lt ""Lester ""Buster"" Crabb RN who mysteriously disappeard while on a mission examining a Russian Warship hull after war.
Great transfer to DVD print, crisp clear and excellent supporting cast including Michael Craig and Sid James.
Underwater scenes filmed in Malta are great. In Michael Craigs recommended autobiography ""The Smallest Giant"" he mentions this film
and the excellent relationship during filming with Laurence Harvey.
One of the best Brit War Movies. Recommended!",1330473600,22,498,5.565789473684211

1154504,5,7885887049,"A really great, action-packed WWII drama, starring Laurence Harvey as Buster Crabb  an explosives expert. This is the true story of Lieutenant Crabb who arrives in Gibraltar in 1941. This film depicts events in Gibraltar harbor during which Italian frogmen are sinking allied ships using chariots to launch torpedo attacks.

Lots of action throughout and wonderful underwater sequences in which both British and Italian frogmen deploy a splendid variety of deep-sea weaponry.

However, as a piece of cinema, it lacked the tension the story could have had. The story should have had me on the edge of my seat, but it didn't.

1155650,3,7885887049,"If you're a WWII buff (like me) then this is a little known story that deserves recognition and a movie you should watch, but be prepared because the acting is absolutely laughable.  For instance, there's a scene where the lead character and one of the supporting actors have infiltrated a neutral port in search of their Italian nemesis who are using the port as a jumping off point to carry out their sabotage, but the acting in the scene (along with many others) is so amateurish it drags the entire story down like one of the ships sinking in the harbor.

I won't go into detail about the Italian temptress holed up with the saboteurs but suffice it to say her character is sufficiently out of place as to make you wonder how in the hell the part got written into the script.

BTW - the special effects, what few were used, are dreadful, which considering the time frame in which this movie was made is surprising.  The technology existed to do a much better job but maybe the budget didn't?

The British then develop a plan to sink the enemy ship the attacks are launched from. If you're a war movie fan that likes a lot of fighting, then this one may not be your cup of tea.

1155961,4,7885887049,"Interesting tale of young officer defending Gibraltar from attacks by Italian frogmen and mini-subs during WWII.  Decent script and good performances.  The underwater battle scenes are quite good for the time and strongly foreshadow the underwater extravaganza in ""Thunderball.""

1155964,4,7885887049,Well restored print of a good tale. The good guys win; and the bad ones (Italians) are not shown unsympathetically. Underwater scenes are excellent. Worth a look if one enjoys the heroic genre common during the period when it was made.,1409443200,,235,4.7560975609756095

1156108,4,7885887049,"Excellent but often overlooked movie.  It is one of those British gems that belongs in the same collection as The Malta Story, the Cruel Sea, and the Dambusters.  The movie is based on the Italian attacks on British ships with undersea chariots, which were used to place explosives under British ships at anchor.  The movie begins with the actual attacks on two British battleships in Alexandria harbor and then moves on to actions in Gibraltar.  It may become a bit fictionalized at that point, but it is great fun to watch.
I have actually seen an Italian chariot submarine at the Washington Navy yard's museum in Washington DC, but this was years ago.  If things are still the same, it is in the ""Annex"" and not the main museum.  Maybe someone reading this has more up to date information.",1405641600,3,792,4.661870503597123

1156114,4,7885887049,Entertaining mostly.  Laurence Harvey is quite handsome here and the ladies should go gaga over his pretty face and youthful bod.  The props used in the film are amusing when compared to the cinema realism we have today.  Enjoy this film as a period piece and ignore the sometimes over-the-top acting of Harvey.,1395878400,,311,4.830188679245283

1156262,4,7885887049,"It is a bit difficult to review this movie.  By today's standards the explosions and special effects and filming are archaic..  That is, of course, to be expected for a movie made in the fifties and is sort of like comparing a race car to a horse and buggy.  The filming of the underwater scenes are pretty good.  The acting is actually quite good and most of the characters do come alive.  The story, on the other hand, is a little slow.  Since it is based on factual events, that is to be expected to some degree, but if you aren't a real war movie buff this could impact the entertainment value somewhat.",1391817600,,607,4.327433628318584

It describes his exploits during World War II and is based on Marshall Pugh's book, ' Commander Crabb.' Definitely recommended for those with an interest in this genre and for WWII history buffs. The documentaries with original footage concerning 'frogmen' is limited. This has a well presented storyline with a good cast. It has all the features one might expect and then some.

Some license taken with a few facts and details but nothing requiring you to suspend disbelief over unless you are really being a stickler for details.

1156611,4,7885887049,"This movie is made in the tradition of the British stiff upper lip, but it still shows well. One of the good scenes is where Crabb pays his respects to an Italian who was killed during an attempt to blow up British shipping. The fact that this film is based in a true incident during WWII makes it better; it shows what some men had to do to help win the war. The Italians are not shown a mad Fascist bombers either, which is good. Recommended.",1373155200,,444,4.174418604651163

I was surprised the underwater scenes were as good as they are for the period (1958). Anyone who is a diver or is interested in diving will want to see this film.

1156618,3,7885887049,"*The Silent Enemy"", made in 1958, is a slow-moving, sometimes frivolous account of a team of British frog drivers in Gibraltar during World War II. This is nowhere nearly as interesting as the classic war movies that came out of Britain during and shortly after the war.

Laurence Harvey here in early outing is very good, almost unexpectedly for I have often found his acting a bit annoying.

This is the story of early career of Commander Crabbe, British undersea diver and war hero that disappeared carrying intelligence mission against Soviet naval vessel in British waters in the 1960s at height of Cold War. I remember later seeing a book that claimed Crabbe had been caught and instead of accepting his execution by the Soviets as a spy turned and worked for the Soviets in Russia.

Interesting movie for us old timers who were kids when WWII was being fought.  Not sure if the modern generation would appreciate a movie without all of the computer graphics (CGI) whiz bang blow ups!
