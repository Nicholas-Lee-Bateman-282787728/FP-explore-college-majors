8090446,4,B000BP5ST2,"Nice scenery backdrop in Bali. Tragic love story of 4 people meeting in Bali then returns to Seoul to play out their cat & mouse games. The two male leads were wonderful and handsome in their roles. The two women leads were shallow. Ha character not well developed to believe why lead actor was obsessed with her. Park woman character had a most irritating voice that made her crafty selfish character more unlikeable. The story moved a bit too slow, too many drinking and drunk scenes, and production design was not visually appealing. However, I liked seeing the story played out.",1421280000,,582,4.772277227722772

8090448,5,B000BP5ST2,"This was the first drama I ever bought online and not the last. Highly recommended drama. A bit pricey at the time, but well worth it. Great shipping and delivery time, too.",1359244800,,173,4.4375
8090449,3,B000BP5ST2,"This kind of drama falls into the catagory of tragedy.  Three people meet in Bali and hire a tour guide.  They seem bored with the trip and return to Korea, which is the location for most of the series.  Each has a host of problems which are their own making.  That is why it was difficult for me to care about the charactors.  After watching 4 episodes, I had little interest in seeing the rest.  But I did watch the last one and had no problems understanding or following the ending.  If you like slow paced tragedies, you will enjoy the show.  It was well acted.  I guess I was looking for something different.",1335052800,,613,4.307017543859649
8090450,5,B000BP5ST2,"FANTASTIC, AWESOME!!! Can't helped but to dream of  being Ha Ji-Won being loved by two georgeous men.  I love Jo-In-Sung and So-Ji-Sub acting was also superb.  It can be a true-to-life story.  All the settings, all the characters especially the three main need an applause.  They're great!!!",1271289600,3,291,5.1063829787234045

O M G !
where to begin. . .you will FEEL this story.

the english subtitles are excellent.",1244419200,2,147,3.7096774193548385
8090453,4,B000BP5ST2,"This drama will pull you in from the very first second and when you come up for air, you will find yourself keeled over with emotions that you didn't expect. This is yet another narrative about love triangles, but this k-drama takes this K-drama formula to comment upon power, money, the role of greed, and where love fits into all these equations.

So Ji-Sub is absolutely wonderful in this drama, and why this series did not propel him into instant stardom, I have no idea. All the actors are terrific, however, so this is really an ensemble piece.

The director/screenwriter should be shot (and I am being ironic) for the ending of the series.",1195084800,5,646,4.657894736842105
8090454,4,B000BP5ST2,"I was hooked on this series from the start.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the ending was very disappointing.  I was so upset that I wanted to demand they rewrite the ending.  HA  That just shows how addicting it was.

So, for those of you who don't like to watch something without a fairytale ending (like I don't), I suggest you steer clear.",1170720000,5,358,4.205882352941177
