Hot Rock Videos, Volume 1, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, copyright 1984 RCA Video Productions, Inc.

If so, here are the contents:

* Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) - Eurythmics

* Come Dancing - The Kinks

* Don't Answer Me - The Alan Parsons Project

* No Way Out - Jefferson Starship

* I've Done Everything For You - Rick Springfield

* I Love You, Suzanne - Lou Reed

* Whisper To A Scream (Birds Fly) - Icicle Works
