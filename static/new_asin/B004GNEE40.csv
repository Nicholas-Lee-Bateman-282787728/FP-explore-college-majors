8428901,3,B004GNEE40,"The author makes a convincing argument that US governmental interests in the form of Obama Care have led healthcare delivery systems away from private insurance funded care (presumably more efficient and responsive to the medical needs of their patient-subscribers) towards a Canadian-style socialized system of healthcare delivery where delays and artificially created MD shortages are the norm for rationing healthcare. This has presumably has led to poorer outcomes in the Canadian patients and will soon have similar effects on patient outcomes in the US. The author seems to believe the absence of private health insurance in Canada has led to this rationing.

Interestingly, the clumsy execution of Obama Care (fundamentally a give-away to the insurance industry) is ironically leading to similar physician shortages and accessibility problems in the US.  The side effect of implementing healthcare reform by an entity whos bottom-line considers the funding of medical care an expense (termed medical loss in insurance parlance) to be minimized is that quality healthcare becomes a faade to be promoted but often not delivered.  Insurance companies thus have an incentive to over-provide for the healthy (who rarely utilize it but pay for the majority of it) and underprovide for the sick, Thus healthcare rationing is in full effect.

The solution to poorly delivered government facilitated HC reform for many patients in both countries has been to seek their care for big-ticket items outside their own country. As a physician, I find it truly saddening that it is nearly impossible to deliver high-quality health-care due to cut-backs, shortages and empowerment of extenders which make the care delivered in a third-world country seem like a better idea for many patients than that delivered in their own US of A!

As outlined in Escape Fire http://www.amazon.com/Escape-Fire-Rescue-American-Healthcare/dp/B009LZCN5K/ref=cm_cr-mr-title , the solution to increasing costs in the setting of decreasing funding will unlikely find a patient-centered solution at a corporate or governmental level.  Certainly insurance companies (with massive databases designed for actuarial decision trees) have a unique ability to weigh-in on which therapies are cost-effective but the ultimate decision of whether a therapy should be financed needs to be a societal one and and not subject to political manipulation or large-scale profiteering by private industry.",1412985600,,2455,5.67574931880109
8428902,1,B004GNEE40,"Loved living in Canada. No  annual deductible. No co-pays except for chiropractic, physio, podiatry, and vision care. Healthcare is affordable - miss  a premium payment? You still have your insurance. Kids are covered even for dental and vision til age 16.
I usually get asked ""how long did I wait to see a doctor?"" In clinic - average was probably 15 minutes and on a rare case if it was flu season, maybe 45 minutes - sign in, and come back closer to when you name will be called. Hospitals  - you have appointments and for tests it ran maybe 30-40 minutes, if that - usually faster. Surgery wait for ""non-cosmetic / scheduled"" - longest wait was a month. You can have a very long wait if your surgery is for cosmetic / non-essential - like up to a year, but you can pay privately and go to a private surgical clinic / hospital. What I loved most about Canadian docs? Focused on practicing medicine and not about how much money they are making. After hours calls, emails, follow up calls, ""old-time style US medicine"" was the norm. They have a max number of patients to see each day - the system protects them from 'burnout"". The docs who want to follow the money trail go to the US. Docs in Canada make about $120,000/ year - nothing like US salaries. But ""wow"" - the quality. They are great - caring, supportive, work as ""team"" with their patients. I felt nurtured and truly cared about. If I came with more than a couple questions, my doctors were  listeners.  Canada doesn't check your wallet to find out first if you are rich or poor - everyone treated equally and for the most part ""great'. It's not a perfect system - but I rarely found people disappointed with their docs, and if they were I encouraged them to switch docs. You never lose your doctor or clinic because the changed contracts with an insurance company. That's not even a possibility there.",1394755200,10,1864,4.486725663716814
8428903,5,B004GNEE40,I think everyone should have a chance to see this tragedy in action. We are headed down this same road to hell. Your dog can get treatment but you may or may not ...great system for idiots!,1391904000,6,189,4.135135135135135
8428904,1,B004GNEE40,"A CBC television show host asked the question -- who is the greatest Canadian? And then, in reality show format, puts it up to a vote.

""After six weeks, ten finalists, and more than a million votes,"" the CBC host says, ""it ended tonight with one name . And I have the envelope here. The greatest Canadian as decided by you is -- Tommy Douglas.""

Imagine that -- the country says that Tommy Douglas, the father of single payer healthcare in Canada, is greater than its greatest hockey player -- Wayne Gretzky.

So why doesn't this documentary address the seeming contradiction that Canadian healthcare is supposedly so awful yet Tommy Douglas is so beloved?",1381968000,3,657,4.745614035087719
8428905,5,B004GNEE40,"After doing research elsewhere, I was not surprised by anything in this documentary except possibly the severity.  We have got to repeal the rancid piece of legislation known as ObamaCare.  The kind of HealthCare we are headed for does not care at all. It will be an entity all its own - mindless and brutal and out of control of even the ones who have created it.  It is breathtakingly reckless to give control of our precious bodies to any government agency, but to the IRS???  You've got to be kidding me...

If you need proof, the Canadian model for what we can expect is all here in this documentary, in the starkest possible reality.  If I could, I would send a copy to everyone in the US.  It is that good.",1348963200,10,713,4.356060606060606
8428906,5,B004GNEE40,"This documentary exposes the truth about socialized or government controlled health care.  Indeed, if we think about it what industry that government controls works well?  They are all...read that ALL monopolies in their market areas.

Free markets cannot be destroyed...the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba, etc. have proven that.  But, they also proved, as has Canada, that Government interference does harm.

I have personally met people from Canada who have real life horror stories of long delays for simple diagnostic tests for serious medical conditions.  Long delays for surgeries and limited drug access.

Once government controls health care, indeed their goal is to limit it for cost reasons.  But, as any knowledgeable person can attest...that applies to the populace, not the rulers of the socialist world...they are like royalty in the old monarchical systems.",1333065600,11,877,5.492537313432836
8428907,1,B004GNEE40,"America: Don't believe the hype.

While no nation has a perfect healthcare system, the one we have here works a LOT better than the one you have there and we don't pay through nealry as much for it.

Nobody in Canada is turned away from a hospital because an HMO said ""no"" and nobody in Canada is denied care because of a ""pre-existing condition.""

My last hospital stay cost NOTHING. No deductible. No fee. No premium to an insurance company.

This is propaganda made by insurance companies & HMO's that want your money for services that people in other counties all over the world do not have to pay for.

If you honestly believe that this movie was made by an impartial filmaker to ""educate"" you about the ""dangers"" of public healthcare then I have a lovely Brooklyn bridge for sale.",1330905600,9,786,4.546099290780142
8428908,5,B004GNEE40,This is a must see!!! It will show you where our country is headed if we don't repeal this joke called ObamaCare.,1330646400,8,113,4.181818181818182
8428909,1,B004GNEE40,"This flawed documentary seemed more like a half-assed attempt by big HMOs reaping profits from high premiums or a half-assed attempt from the bozos in what the US calls the 'conservative' right to deter the momentum now commonly known as Obamacare.  It was so poorly done, I immediately regretted paying $10 just to watch it stream from their website.  It's even worse than Michael Moore's Sicko.

Do yourself a favor and do some research for yourself instead of watching an inaccurate depiction of not just Obamacare, but the Canadian healthcare system itself.  What the documentary doesn't want to tell you is beyond the 'ineffiencies' of Canada's hospitals and providers is also decades and billions worth of improvement to bring an ideal to what it is today.  You'd be surprised at how similar (and I dare say, even better) Canada's healthcare is compared to America's.  Long wait times?  Shortage of services and medical professionals?  Deaths due to waits?  Packed hospitals?  There are horror stories like these all across America too, the difference is that Canada gets more attention when it happens in their country.  The documentary also doesn't mention that a few provinces in Canada have already allowed its citizens freedom to buy privatized healthcare like the ones available in the US.

It's amusing the lengths some people would go to snuff out something they fear when Obamacare in theory, would just be a good step in a different direction--and that step won't even bring America CLOSE to what Canada can provide to its people.  It's just a beginning.",1330646400,10,1570,5.038759689922481
8428910,5,B004GNEE40,"This brilliant documentary is a jaw-dropping expos of the Canadian health system and a sneak-preview of ObamaCare. It is a clear, concise, thorough, and extremely moving portrayal of the tragedy that is taking place north of America's borders. Through a series of carefully chosen, dramatic vignettes that follow various patients and doctors, the producer shows exactly how the Canadian people are suffering---and literally dying---in endless waits for medical treatment. We also see clearly how the destruction of medicine is inevitable with any government-run health system. Every American needs to see this film and really understand how much there is to lose if government encroaches even deeper into our healthcare system, most notably if ObamaCare is not repealed.
