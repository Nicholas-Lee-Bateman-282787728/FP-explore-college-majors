4189364,4,B003SPDSEY,"Evolution-R is the second half-season of the newest Slayers (completing what began in Revolution), and it's still got the same crazy antics, the same nearly-doomed world being saved by an ingenious sorceress, et cetera... and I love it. Perhaps my only complaint is that, per usual, Lina steals most of the screentime and leaves her three companions to fight for what little is left. But the dub is stellar (they got the original cast back!), the animation is superb, and the humor is just as good as it used to be. Recommended if you liked the old ones.",1282262400,,554,4.663265306122449
4189365,5,B003SPDSEY,"Revolution and Evolution-R are a fantastic addition to the Slayers series. The two series are advertised as separate seasons in their own right, but must be owned together to enjoy to their fullest.

 A 10 year gap between Try and Revolution, as well as a strange animal character, had originally unsettled me from the idea of purchasing this series. I should learn to have more faith in the teams that work on this series as it turned out to prove me wrong every step of the way. With only one episode I only didn't care for (not bad, however, not fantastic) the series settled in nicely with a feeling that it had never left off (Except for the gorgeous artwork and animation boosted by a higher budget). At times it almost feels like a rehash of the first season but I'm torn over thinking of this negatively since it takes all of the best moments from the first season and turns them around to be far more epic than they could have ever been.

The new additions to the cast were surprisingly enjoyable, in particular the Pokemon-like Pokota. There are several nods and in-jokes to past seasons, novels and movies for the loyal fans to enjoy while also being humorous simply for the sake of being so (Nama particularly comes to mind as a great example of this). A delightful and fun watch every step of the way... who can argue with more of a loved classic, especially when done so well?

The subbing job done by Funimation is a high step above the old muddled and guess-work subs done by Central Park Media. The only strange part I noticed was deciding to no longer try to translate the term ""Mazoku"" and leaving it as-is. It was always a little strange to see a Japanese word, albeit likely familiar to many Slayers fans, in the middle of a sentence when all other -zoku races had been translated. Still, this is better than the central park media translations by large and by far.",1281830400,,1886,4.505847953216374
4189366,5,B003SPDSEY,Slayers is the one of the better anime series out there. From the 1st Season to 5th Season its a great anime. Lots of Magic and Sword fighting in this anime with lots of running gags from calling Lina Ms Flat Chest to Prince Phil being called a troll. Its a Must for any anime fan out there. There is 5 seasons and OVA/OAV Movie boxset to. I have been watching The Slayers Series from day one and I have really enjoyed the series,1278806400,,429,4.119047619047619
4189367,5,B003SPDSEY,I love this show so much. Happy they made another season. Not that happy about Zelos and voice change though. And it seems like they were bored or lost on what to do so they brought back some old characters. But Lena and Gourie still rock!,1278806400,,239,4.217391304347826
4189368,5,B003SPDSEY,"Slayers Evolution-R absolutely 100% redeems the previous Slayers Revolution of its mediocrity.  Slayers Revolution wasn't terrible, but it was disappointing, and seemed mostly pointless.  Evolution-R is another story.  It is exciting, funny, and in some ways more revolutionary than its counterpart.

Evolution-R follows the tried and true Slayers formula closely.  It starts with silly episodes and later moves on to more serious ones.  The silly episodes here are still a little weak, but they are better than the silly episodes in Revolution, and some of them even advance the story and develop the characters a little, so they are not entirely pointless.  The serious episodes are where this season shines.

The Zuuma subplot is interesting, and managed to make me like the character quite a bit more.  In Revolution, I found Zuuma very annoying and found it hard to believe the Slayers would even have a problem dealing with him.  In this new season, Zuuma gets an interesting plot that puts the Slayers in a unique situation, which allows for some good character development on Lina's part.  It was good to see the Slayers in a situation where they had to show a little self-control and reasoning, rather than just blasting everything in sight.

Many have complained that the climax of this season feels recycled and uninspired.  I disagree.  Yes, the finale is reminiscent of Season 1's finale, but there are enough differences to make it interesting, and the updated drawing style helps too.  In season 1, I felt that it ended very abruptly, and they never really gave ample time to wrap up and provide closure for Rezo the Redpriest.  This season provides us with that closure, and gives us some insights into Rezo's mind.  Plus, we get to see Rezo fight Xellos, and we get to see Lina fire off a freaking volley of Dragon Slaves.  She's never done that before, and it was fun to witness.

The best part of this season was the character development.  Slayers is generally lacking in the character development department (mostly because they like to focus on humor) especially when it comes to developing characters besides Lina.  But this season gave at least 1 episode to each of the other 3 main characters.  Amelia and Gourry both got rather silly episodes, but they did build their characters a little nonetheless.

By far the most interesting and exciting part of the season is the episode that focuses on Zelgadis.  This episode alone is worth the purchase in my opinion.  After 4 seasons and eleven years, Zel finally gets one episode that builds his character and gives us insights into his conflicted mind.  The part where Zel confronts Rezo is absolutely priceless.

So, is this season perfect? No, definitely not.  It certainly has its flaws.  The anti-climactic resolution to the Zuuma subplot comes to mind.  But it has greatly improved everything that we saw in the Slayers Revolution, and it has surprised me with good character development, and an exciting story.  Nothing will ever beat Slayers NEXT in my mind, but this season does a good job nonetheless.  I give it a perfect score because it is the PERFECT addition to every Slayers fan's collection.

For those of you that haven't watched Slayers (as if they'd ever be reading this review), go watch it, NOW!  For Slayers fans, I guarantee you will greatly enjoy watching this season.  A must buy for all slayers fans.",1278028800,4,3398,4.901754385964912
4189369,5,B003SPDSEY,"""Slayers Evolution-R"" is billed as the fifth season, but it's actually more like the second half of the fourth season -- it wraps up all the dangling plot threads and deals with the whole Taforashia disaster. And unsurprisingly, things get a lot darker in these episodes -- as you'd expect for the Slayerverse, things start lighthearted and goofy (soap opera!), but slowly become apocalyptic and explosive.

Lina and her friends focus their efforts on finding the Hellmaster's Jar, a magical item that transfers souls -- and currently holds the spirit of Rezo the Red Priest. With the assistance of a living suit of armor named Nama, the gang launches off into their latest quest... only to get tangled in a bizarre scheme of Zuuma's. He's sent Ozzel and the Hellmaster's Jar to a wealthy merchant named Radock, and lures Lina and Co. to the same town.

Of course, nothing is that simple: Radock isn't all he appears to be, monsters are attacking, and Xellos is trying to get his hands on the jar. However, getting the jar isn't the end of the Slayers' problems, especially since Pokota is determined to resurrect Rezo so the priest can restore his homeland of Taforashia -- and he trusts Rezo a lot more than the rest of the gang does. What is the Red Priest keeping hidden from them?

""Slayers Evolution R"" pretty much does what the second half of every ""Slayers"" story arc does -- all the various loose plot threads (Ozzel, the jar, Taforashia) are tied up neatly, and Lina ends up getting roped into a potentially apocalyptic struggle that somehow stems from everything else in the plot. All that, and we get some nice nostalgia moments with Rezo and ""Nama"" (who seems strangely familiar to Amelia and Lina).

There's still plenty of hilarious stuff woven in, especially in the hilarious ""soap opera"" episode that mocks all the melodramatic stuff (""The shock of the accident's given me amnesia!"" ""I have amnesia too!""). But things get much darker after the gang encounters Zuuma again, resulting in some gruesome deaths, creepy monsters (hair tentacles!) and a horrific flashback where we see how poor Zelgadis became a chimera.

The biggest flaw is that the Epic Climactic Battle feels like a copy of a previous Epic Climactic Battle from way back in the first season. Seriously, come up with something new!

Lina is still bombastic and a little crazy, but she also seems more intelligent this time around, since she's apparently able to unravel people's nefarious plots. There's also fun episodes for Gourry (dumb and good-hearted) and Amelia (who gets stuck inside Nama), and poor Pokota is driven to desperate measures to save his people. And poor Zelgadis is forced to relive the horrors of his transformation into a chimera -- the scene where he finally confronts Rezo's soul is hauntingly powerful.

""Slayers Evolution R"" isn't an independent season -- instead, it finishes up the stories begun in ""Slayers Revolution,"" and winds up being a rollicking, dark-tinged adventure/comedy with a deja-vuey ending.",1277251200,5,3017,4.950592885375494
4189370,4,B003SPDSEY,"As the second of two thirteen episode collections comprising the recent Slayers anime series revival, Evolution-R more than lives up to expectations...though it at times safely and rather blatantly borrows from the past to ensure doing so.

Picking up from Season 4/Revolution--what most other anime series would call part one of a single season--Season 5/Evolution-R (part two, natch) starts off with a batch of lighter-weight episodes after Lina and company (including Revolution newcomer Pokota) discuss what to do post-Revolution.  These are enlivened by the entertainingly irritating ""Nama"", an animated suit of armor with a voice and personality that distresses Lina in their familiarity as much as pitch.  As we move further along the main plot asserts itself, things become more serious, old nemesis Rezo--seen on the cover itself--figures more prominently, and the overall stakes build towards a harrowing (and pyrotechnic) conclusion.

The aforementioned borrowing of elements mostly comes from what many consider the strongest of the earlier Slayers seasons, Slayers Next.  A scene involving Lina realizing how much she relies on Gourry simply being there must have given Lisa Ortiz (Lina's defining voice actress) a serious case of dj vu.  And the final episode even more so.

Technically, the series shines.  In full widescreen, smoothly animated and bursting with color, Slayers has never looked better.  Indeed, it competes visually quite well against the wider anime landscape.  Audio is also of top quality, with extra kudos directed to the exceptional English dub.

Funimation went out of its way to secure the ""primary four"" American voice actors for Lina, Gourry, Zelgadis, and Amelia.  All not only reprise their earlier roles with confidence, but in some cases sound even better.  Such as Veronica Taylor as Amelia, who manages to revisit every ounce of energy the character had a decade ago, but now in crisp 5.1 surround audio.

Some other important characters have been recast as necessary, and the results also shine.  In particular, Xellos and ""Nama""--a name that Xellos himself remarks sounds ""close enough"" to what you may be thinking--have been solidly recast, with voice actors that remind of the past efforts while remaining individual.

Similarly, Evolution-R itself works safely within the familiar Slayers framework yet maintains a solidly individual, updated feel.  Bolstered by the crisp visuals and the exceptional English dub, Evolution-R is highly recommended to series fans.  Evolution-R also works for newcomers, even standing alone from Revolution, but they will benefit from the forewarning that the silly antics of the first several episodes are not representative of the relatively more serious episodes that the show shifts rather sharply into later on.",1276732800,,2800,5.472093023255814

8404634,2,B003SPDSEY,"This only gets two-stars like Season 4 because of the effort.  The video and audio look just like a cleaner version of the previous series, so aesthetically it feels like the show didn't have a long break between season 3 and now.  Unfortunately just like Season 4 this is just so formulaic and repetitive, you can predict exactly how things will plan out and it's just recycling the first season TWICE because pretty much the same thing was done in Season 4.  I think they just didn't know what to do, and figured it had been long enough they could get away with only slightly recycling the same season 1 over again; instead of doing things the least bit differently.",1437609600,,668,4.55

8404641,3,B003SPDSEY,"Slayers has been one of my favorite series since it came out all those years ago, and I still break out my old DVD's and watch all or most of the series every year or so. I was so excited when I learned there was another 26 episodes going to be released and I picked up both Blue Ray collections as soon as they came out. While I would still buy them, I'm rather disappointed this time around; I'll list some of my problems here.

1. The English dub feels forced and unnatural, it doesn't compliment the animation at all. previous installments have had competent though underwhelming dubs but this one should be skipped. Fortunately the Japanese voice cast does a commendable job, I can't speak Japanese, but the emotion seeps through. Similarly, for this release it's obvious that quite a few liberties have been taken translating for the subtitle. I can't speak for the extent, but it's enough to be disappointing.

2. Many of the characters introduced in Revolution return for this season including Zuuma and Ozzel, and a couple of new characters are introduced (Namely Nama). All these characters have mysterious backgrounds which have been hinted at through this story arc, but by the end of the series they are all (with the exception of Pokota) dispatched without any elaboration or insight into their pasts.

3. There's very little character development to speak of in this season. With the exceptions of Lina and Pokota, all the characters presences are mostly anecdotal and could be interchanged with any of the other characters just as easily. This is really a shame because what drew me to anime in the first place was the heavy concentration on character development.

4. Lastly, this iteration just isn't epic enough. Previous installments have done a good job of making battles just feel right with suitably intense music, overblown animation with massive explosions, and creating a general sense of hopelessness at the right moments. This time around they just didn't accomplish that, with the exception of the last episode it doesn't even feel like they attempted to.

Overall I would still buy this set, but I'm still not happy with the results; there was so much potential here and it went unfulfilled",1298160000,,2220,4.877984084880636
8404642,5,B003SPDSEY,"The rumored Fourth and Fifth Season had really seemed likt it would never arrive, but its finally here and it didn't quite disappoint.

For those enthusiasts who might have disliked the Tenchi series, when the artwork kept changing, this might be a bit disagreeable for them (or really anyone who doesn't like when the way an anime is drawn changes from season to season).

Still they kept the elements of their outfits the same, as well as the feel of the show, which is more than we can ask for when it has been so long since its debut.

The English Dub actors pretty much all came back, although the voice of Xellos was a bit of a surprise for myself. Still while there hasn't really been any real character development among the characters, it still keeps to the fun that the previous seasons had. It isn't Slayers NEXT, but it is more similiar to TRY.

Besides bring Rezo back kind of puts us full circle, which I like. Overall a great season.",1297123200,,948,4.46242774566474
8404643,4,B003SPDSEY,"While a good season continuing the Slayers series, it wasn't very original. Slayers Revolution was marginally better in this aspect. But it is still worth watching. A series that makes a comeback after 10 years has to be respectable. These newest two seasons use some different voice actors and, in at least one case, I think they could have done better.
This is a comedy-fantasy set in a magical world. I'd say it's good for teens and up, maybe younger but parents may want to watch it first.",1284249600,,493,4.613636363636363
