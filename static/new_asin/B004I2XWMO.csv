4382533,5,B004I2XWMO,"This is an interesting collection of mostly Warner Brothers cartoons produced during World War 2 to promote morale. Imagine Daffy Duck conking Hitler on the head with a mallet! When I was growing up, I would watch Warner Brothers cartoons every day, and I never saw any of these except for the one with Bugs Bunny and the gremlin. I suppose they no longer show these cartoons because they've become dated, but they are still great. Many of the collection contains Pvt. Snafu cartoons. Pvt. Snafu, who sounds exactly like Bugs Bunny (Mel Blanc, of course), I imagine was shown to enlisted men on what NOT to do. Snafu manages to bungle everything up, because he doesn't listen to army rules. For instance, in -Gas-, he forgets to bring his gas mask, which becomes a huge mistake when a cloud of anthropomorphic enemy gas encircles him. In another cartoon, Snafu goes on leave, has a few drinks, and starts blabbing secrets about troop movements much to the delight of nearby Axis spies. Then there's Porky Pig hunting for a ""Nutzy/Nazi"" spy, very cute. It's all done in classic Warner Brothers animation style with the wonderful Mel Blanc doing the voices as always. The only non-Warner short on this collection is a stop motion piece called -Bury The Axis- which is aslo pretty funny.",1294531200,2,1284,4.762331838565022

It made me think of an idea.
My father liked the old loony toons.
So that was his birthday present.",1391904000,,144,3.8333333333333335
4382555,5,B004I2XWMO,"If there's one thing that always gets a happy laugh from my parents, it's watching World War II era cartoons. Despite the fact some of them have not aged well, like the classic ""Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips"", they still crack up everytime. Besides, hearing Bugs Bunny sing ""Someone's Rocking my Dreamboat"", a classic song by the Ink Spots, has me double over every time!",1390176000,2,366,4.6461538461538465
4382556,1,B004I2XWMO,"Easily recognized as a homemade pirate dvd. Didn't work in player, complete waste of money and plastic. Buyer beware please.",1389830400,,124,5.25

4382559,3,B004I2XWMO,"There are many great WWII cartoons here which are never seen any longer. This is the good part.

 The bad is the execution. The scan quality and sound is OK to poor and the copy of the disc itself is shabby. Mine skipped too much to watch.",1363651200,8,239,4.0638297872340425

4382561,5,B004I2XWMO,"This is an interesting collection of cartoons from WW2, a time when even the entertainment was geared toward the war efort. Most of the cartoons on this disk comes from Warner Brothers Studios. There are some familiar friends like Porky and Daffy, and the long forgotton Private Snafu. Some of these cartoons are in black and white which may turn some people off, but, for others, it's an amazing glimpse of animation during the world's greatest war.",1320192000,6,450,4.857142857142857
4382562,1,B004I2XWMO,"This product was very disappointing.  It gives every indication of being a poor copy of another product.  The disc was a standard retail DVD and the covers appeared to have been printed on a color copier.  On top of that, the image quality was totally unsatisfactory.  In short, I returned the product to Amazon!",1319068800,26,312,4.722222222222222
4382563,1,B004I2XWMO,"Not a Warner Bros dvd!!!looks like it was made at home on someones comuter. By burning  different dvds together. Was not very good. Condition was not very good at all.

8429977,5,B004I2XWMO,"The quality of the cartoons vary, but overall the quality is good.  The DVD contains 18 Black and White as well as color cartoons (10 Private Snafu (U.S. Army),  2 Mr. Hook (US Navy) and the an assortment (6) of Looney Tunes).  I would consider the cartoons to be some of Mel Blanc's lesser known work.  There is only 1 Bugs Bunny.  The sound is solid.  There is no popping or crackling.  The packaging  are an indication there aren't any bells and whistles with this DVD.  Frankly that was one of my concerns.  Quite often, DVDs containing public domain videos don't work to well.  That's not the case.  My computer had no trouble playing the DVD.",1447200000,3,648,4.491379310344827
