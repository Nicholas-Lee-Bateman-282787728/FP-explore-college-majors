681039,1,6303562515,"""Our Town"" has been one of my favourite films for many years, and I've been waiting a long time for a DVD version to appear. Like the  previous reviewer, I knew I was in for disappointment ( to say the least )  when I saw the quality of the DVD. With the jumpy, out of focus, dirty  print to the almost inaudible audio track throughout I have seldom seen a  worse example of ""remastering"" in a long career of movie  watching. Avoid this one - instead have a look at the wonderful Criterion  re-issue of ""Brief Encounter"", for an example of how a classic  film should be treated.",966902400,16,578,4.296296296296297
681040,4,6303562515,"Martha Scott is superb as Emily, the young woman trying to find her way through life in the midst of an alarmingly changing world. The Great War, technology and fate itself intervene to irrevocably change her life, and  those of the residents of Grovers Corner. This is one of the most  heart-rending stories filmed, yet it has a dignified air and unsentimental  approach which lifts it above others of its era. Thornton Wilder has  produced a portrait of a community stripped bare, yet revealing in its  intimacy and humanness.",936576000,6,528,4.887640449438202
681041,5,6303562515,"I've seen this movie countless times, yet each time, I discover something new.  As history, it is an excellent look back at life in the early 1900's.  The sets and scenes teach great lessons about what day-to-day life what  like 100 years ago. The houses, stores and dress are all remarkable.  The  movie has a great cast and a great message.  Every moment of life is  precious far beyond what we may see from our current perspective. We all  tend to sail through life without taking a moment to savor all the little  blessings of each day.  Watching this movie, I sometimes wish I could crawl  into the video and live in Grover's Corners for just a day or two.  It  looks so lovely and simple and peaceful and inspiring.",914889600,32,721,4.453846153846154
681092,1,6303562515,*WARNING* Do not purchase this from Amazon. The disc did not work in three different machines. Stopped at Chapter 5. Waste of Money and a severe disappointment because it is a classic. Amazon has a continuous problem like this with many discs.,1495584000,3,243,4.809523809523809
681093,3,6303562515,"For a better quality picture of this movie, go to YouTube, type in ""Our Town 1940"" and choose the one that has a length of 1:29:35 (FilmoTeca TV). Since the music is Aaron Copland, it can be found on CD.
The movie is in many ways a documentary and so may not have to have a theme that comes around to a conclusion. It is how life used to be for many, all the way into the 50's, but lost in the 60's and 70's ... today, almost extinct. Emily sees a vision and amazes to watch it unfold to become true. That's one of the precious moments I remember.
I would give it 4-5 stars for significant content, but the quality gets in the way.",1495324800,4,631,4.015873015873016

681099,3,6303562515,"This DVD looks like they basically just ran an unrestored copy of the original film that had been sitting in a film case for 70 years through a projector and printed that to DVD.  Lots of static, (both video and audio,) and there are times when the dialogue is nearly impossible to understand, even through big stereo speakers.  Also, the film itself is a cowardly, Hollywood cop-out, especially at the ending - which Thornton Wilder hated.  However, if you want to give your English class a little perspective, the film does have value for the glimpse it gives us of small town New Hampshire life in very early 1900's - a way of living that is almost unimaginable to our little 21st century screen addicts today.",1483833600,2,713,4.642857142857143

681235,4,6303562515,Eric Copeland (one of America's composer) music playing throughout the movie of Our Town complete the theme of this movie.  The movie itself tells of a time in America that some people say was a simpler time.  The truth is when looking back in hindsight life in America has  never been simple as this movie shows.  Our Town is a slow moving movie that has no special effects nor does it have super heroes or glamorous women.  It is just a story of life encapsulated in the history of a small town that shows what life was like.  I love history and to see a movie like Our Town helps me to visualize life as it was then.,1461110400,,619,4.203389830508475

681290,3,6303562515,"Although ""Our Town"" is considered a classic of the American stage, I had actually never seen either a stage production nor the movie. But as I am a film buff and a student of Film history, I decided to watch finally catch it, and even though, or maybe because the film purportedly remained faithful to the play, the story left me a bit flat. I am not sure if it was the acting, which in some cases seemed a little stilted, or the story itself, or the ending, which was a bit too convenient, although a bit unexpected, or if my non-religious perspective was put off, but whatever it was, it was a bit disappointing.",1453593600,,614,4.3478260869565215

681339,5,6303562515,"This is one of my favorite plays of all time.  I adore Thornton Wilder.  His feel for regular America, his empathy with his subjects.  I really love this movie.  The quality of the DVD itself is not great, but the story, and Copeland's music are just so very sentimental and enjoyable.  The story in the movie is a little different, in that Martha Scott relives her 16th as opposed to 12th birthday (like a previous review said she was just too old to play 12) and in the play she dies in the end, in the movie she makes it, but other than that, it is a wonderful piece of Americana.  I watch it over and over, and it always makes my heart swell with longing for ""the good old days"", a less complicated world.  I highly recommend tis picture.",1453161600,,742,4.257142857142857
681340,3,6303562515,"Though I am older, I have only recently been recently been reintroduced to :""Our Town"". As ORIGINALLY WRITTEN , it is a great masterpiece. Unfortunately, this version, which blunts the impact of the ending, TOTALLY CHANGES THE MEANING of the Play in doing so. In my opinion, EVERYTHING in ""Our Town"" leads up to the ending as originally written. If left as written, this would easily rank 5 stars, but in this altered version, regardless of the quality of the print, This version of Our Town is a bit like imbibing aa drink that uses Sacharin when the recipe called for Sugar-with a strong touch of Bitters.
Watch and enjoy it accordingly , and when you get an opportunity, go and watch a version that is true to the Play as written. It is worth it.",1450656000,,749,4.514705882352941

The picture quality was equally poor--lacking crisp focus or indeed, any focus.  Performances were ho-hum, unexceptiona, pedestrian.  That the play is dated may not have mattered, if any of the producers or actors had seemed to give a damn.

681462,5,6303562515,"I had never seen this movie or read the book until I caught a part of it on Turner Classic Movies.  I wanted then to see the entire movie.  This, to me, is one of the most thought provoking plays ever written.  Thornton Wilder did an outstanding job creating a play with so many hidden and obvious meanings on life, love, death, and that ever elusive ""something eternal.""  I am still mulling over the many themes and metaphors evoked by his masterpiece.  When I ask around, I find that others fail to understand the main theme of the play, or miss the point altogether.  I have watched several segments of this movie over and over in an attempt to grasp the meaning in its entirety.  I have searched the internet for answers, and find that there are as many interpretations out there as there are hidden meanings.  I am not sure that anyone knows all of the secrets of this play.

The movie version of the play was likewise well done.  The black and white color is perfect for presenting this film and its lachrymose third act.  The seasoned character actors performed well.  It was especially interesting to see a young William Holden.  I did not recognize him until I saw the cast notes.  Frank Cravens fits the part of narrator perfectly.  And, oh, the musical score.  Outstanding work done by Aaron Copeland. The haunting refrain fit  the movie perfectly.  Had to be one of Copeland's best works.  I noticed that Ken Burns used Copeland's music in his recent series on the Roosevelts.

I think that only Thornton Wilder can unlock for us all of the meanings of this movie.  But, of course, we will never know since he is dead.  But perhaps some time in the  future on a lonely hilltop in a small town, we may find him and be able to discuss the movie with him, if his memory of earthly life has not faded.  Be that as it may, all who watch this film will come away with a new look on the meaning of life.  Enough for now, I am going back to review the movie carefully again.

Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN had 336 Broadway performances between 2/4/38 and 11/19/38.

Wilder, plus Frank Craven and Harry Chandler, wrote this screen adaptation. Craven reprises here his role of the Stage Manager. Director Sam Wood gives the barebones stageshow a more traditional look.

The story concerns early 20th Century life in the village of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. Among the several that unfold betwee 1901 and '13 is that of two young next-door neighbors who marry and start a family. She dies after her second childbirth, sees the spirits of family and friends who passed on before her and gives an impassioned plea to all to get as much from life as possible, for it's a fleeting thing.

Sad but profound stuff in this Pulitzer Prize winner that also garnered six Oscar nods.

681776,3,6303562515,"Our Town (Sam Wood, 1940)

Sam Wood's 1940 film adaptation of Our Town was a missed opportunity from the very start. ""Ill-conceived"" is a great way to describe it. For why would you take a play whose main draw is its complete lack of sets--it makes the audience rely on their imaginations in order to fill in the blanks--and provide it with those very sets? You've cut out a great deal of what makes the play so distinctive. The other side of the coin is that Wood stocked the film with a number of fine actors, and the caliber of the performances lessens the blow somewhat.

In case you've been living under a rock since 1938 and have somehow managed to avoid being exposed to Our Town at all, the plot: ...well, there really isn't a plot. Our Town is a slice-of-life film that takes place at the turn of the 20th century. The main storyline has to do with the romance of George Gibbs (Sunset Blvd.'s William Holden), the son of the town doctor (It's a Wonderful Life's Thomas Mitchell), and girl-next-door Emily Webb (the film debut of Martha Scott, reprising her Broadway role). But, as is usually the case with films like this, there are any number of other storylines that loom large in the background, ready to take over the narrative at any time--the lonely, repressed life of the town's choirmaster, Simon Stimson (Room Service's Philip Wood, another stage actor, who died a few months before the film's release); family drama at the Gibbs household; George's impending baseball career; etc., etc.

Underneath the film's bucolic exterior is a rather nasty heart, and whether you are going to end up enjoying it relies entirely on whether you assume (as I did) Wilder meant that as a criticism, or whether he meant to celebrate it. You get the first stirrings of this very early on (the narrator tells us that the town's population ""is two thousand, six hundred forty-two, not counting about five hundred Polish immigrants""), but the real nastiness, that casts a pall over the entire film, is the town's treatment of Stimson, who is both gay and alcoholic. The latter, presumably, growing out of his need to keep the former secret. All of the town's wonderfully fridnly ladies, who wouldn't think of locking their doors at night (even with all those Polacks so close by!), treat Stimson with the barest veneer of civility covering their scorn, even when he's supposed to be commanding them at choir practice. It might be a minor spoiler to say that, for the careful viewer, this storyline does take over the plot during Act 3, though in such a way as to preserve deniability on the part of everyone involved. (To say how, on the other hand, would constitute a major spoiler; all I can say is that Stimson and Emily briefly become best buds.)

Normally I'd take such a critical attitude as a given, but if so--and this is a problem with the source material, not the film, I rush to add--Wilder pulled his punches at the end, which tacks on a cheese-puff moral that has sweet FA to do with all that underlying criticism of turn-of-the-century American heartland life, and effectively hamstrings it, leading me to even have to ask this otherwise ridiculous question. Rather than ponder it, I'm going to take the turn-of-the-century American heartland attitude towards it, assume that my assumption is correct, and stop thinking about it, because otherwise this watchable, if minor, film becomes an offensive mess that you're better off never knowing existed. (For the record, to lend credence to my interpretation of things, Wilder is widely considered to have been homosexual, albeit closeted in much the same way Stimson is [link removed for Amazon consumption]). ***",1368057600,,3673,4.806962025316456

In addition the movie had a different ending from the play with the main character not dying.

681829,3,6303562515,"Aaron Copland wrote the film score for this 1940 movie version of this play; that was the draw for me. Any student or fan of music history should consider owning this film simply as documentation of Copland's score.

By today's standards, the execution of the play is sentimental, but don't judge the interpretation too harshly. Keep in mind the time period during which this was made, was really the very tail-end of the Romantic period (from a music standpoint, Rachmaninoff was still alive, and Richard Strauss had yet to compose his ""Four Last Songs""). The public expected more romantic, sentimental films, and this was not lost on Hollywood producers. The film also provides a good visual representation of life at the start of the 20th century. Still, there is a gentleness, and sensitivity about this version of the film - sentiments that have all but disappeared from today's society.

I agree with the other reviewers about the quality of the video and audio transfer; it is extremely poor. The film also lacks the clarity of delivery, vision, and dramatic punch of the outstanding subsequent versions in which Hal Holbrook, and later, Paul Newman appear. However, all said, this version is worth the price of admission as a historical document. The film was released in 1940, and at the time, 1900 wasn't that long ago.

681900,4,6303562515,"This is the kind of art that snobs like to look down on - nostalgic, sentimental, simple - yet there is a great beauty and sensitivity in this production.  One of the great surprises for me was the young William Holden, whom I remember from his hard bitten later roles; here he is young, handsome, and sincere in his love for the girl next door.  Beyond that, you witness the intricacies of a small town in the early 1900s, when there were fewer choices and the limits and simplicity did not seem to disturb most of the residents.  At the center is, of course, a story of love, the most basic story of all.

That being said, the play portrays the span of time and examines life in a novel way.  It skips to crucial episodes, even viewed beyond death.  The most amazing thing is that it works and, at least for me, is very moving in its universality.  It brought tears to my eyes, which my adolescent daughter noticed with curiosity before hugging me in empathy.  (She was putting up with yet another weird film that dad wanted to introduce to her at that point.)

The only thing that didn't work for me was the presence of an ageless narrator, who talked directly to the camera.  He was a bit too stylized for my taste and didn't add to the drama so much as explained things.

In high school, I read the play and was devistated by Emily's death, which was changed in the film, giving it a happy ending.  Throughout the years and varias versions that I've seen , I have never been able to figure out what it exactly is , that  the dead people were preparing FOR in the cemetary. But, my reason for writing this is because of  the one thing that is never mentioned in any of these reviews : the beautiful musical score by Aaron Copeland. I'm am over 50 years old and just listening to Mr. Copeland's score starts my tears flowing. It is truely exquisite! I count myself lucky to have had the oppertunity of meeting him briefly in 1972, and meeting Martha Scott app. 10 years later.",1187827200,6,864,4.3478260869565215
681938,4,6303562515,"Our Town was adapted from Thorton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winning play.  It has three acts, each about a different aspect of life in Grovers Corner, New Hampshire as seen through the life of two neighbors, the Gibbs and the Webbs.  On stage, there were virtually no sets.  The film had full sets.  The one truly theatrical feature the film retained was Stage Manager, who narrates the film. The film version featured some early performances from future Oscar winners.

The first act is A Day in the Life (June 7, 1901).  We get to see a day in the life of the two families.  The Gibbs are Julia (Fay Bainter), Dr. Frank (Thomas Mitchell), George (William Holden) and Rebecca.  The Webbs are Myrtle (Beulah Bondi), Editor Charles (Guy Kibbee), Emily (Martha Scott) and Wally.  This is the ordinary life of ordinary families.  George and Emily are the same age and they have a crush on each other but they are too shy to express it.  Most of the act revolves around this.

The second act is Love and Marriage (three years later).  George and Emily are about to be married and each has their own pre-wedding jitters.  But before the wedding we see a flashback on the day that George and Emily finally admitted their feelings for each other.

The third act is Death (nine years later).  Emily has complications with child birth and dies.  The souls of those who passed converse.  Emily finds out that she go back and relive a day.  Which makes her realize how much we take for granted.  The one change that the film makes is here.  In the film, Emily does not actually die but comes back to life to be with George and the baby.

This change in the ending actually lessens the film.  But what is even worse is the cinematography.  In the cemetery scene, Emily's head is often out of frame.  And as she about half the lines, its very disconcerting.  This framing error happens often throughout the film.  Also the contrast of black, white and grey is often murky.  You might say that it is the transfer for the DVD but I also have a copy of the film from Turner Classics and it is as murky and poorly framed.  Therefore, it was probably the original print.

This is a wonderful play and it's interesting to see a very young William Holden.  The best filmed version of this was the NBC production in 1978 with Sada Thompson and Barbara Bel Geddes but this is not available.  So if you want Our Town, it's either this one or the Showtime production with Paul Newman.

681939,3,6303562515,"This version of the play is quite faithful to the original play by Thornton Wilder until the third act.  Well, there is that little bit just before the wedding when George and Emily each have their separate moments of cold feet and their parents remind them of how much they are in love with their intended spouses and how the family is depending on them to go through with the wedding---the movie did skip that little bit in Act Two.  But Act Three is very different from the original play.  We get voice-over as the camera scans the graveyard and only after the camera pans the sky of sparkling stars do we see the dead sitting on chairs and talking---clearly the audience is supposed to think these people are in heaven.  I really think Thorton Wilder clearly states that the people in the cemetery are in the process of forgetting their old lives and preparing for what comes after, so I don't think Wilder wanted us to think they were in heaven yet.  And then to top it all off, Emily lives--the whole funeral procession, the coming back to see herself celebrate her 16th birthday (in the play it is her 12th birthday, but Martha Scott looked way too old for 12)and the being frustrated that life went by too fast and she did not take time to really reach out to the people she loved----it all turns out to be a dream!  I have not been so disappointed since Patrick Duffy stepped out of the shower and an entire season of ""Dallas"" turned out to be a dream.  When I showed this part to my students, they started yelling at the screen that it was just wrong, that the third act in this version missed the whole point that Wilder was trying to make in his play.  The sound and lighting were good, a little fuzzy, as it represented a blurred look at life a century ago.  William Holden is so young and his voice does not have the deep gravelly tone it had later after a lot of cigarettes, so he is perfect as George.  Martha Scott is beautiful, if a little old-looking for Emily at the age she was supposed to be in the play.  I recommend this movie version of the play to anyone who thinks that a happy ending is necessary for a movie to be good.  A happy ending for ""Our Town"" is just wrong.",1128297600,22,2194,4.311435523114355
682000,3,6303562515,"I preface my comments by stating that Tornton Wilders play, ""Our Town,"" is one of my favorite stage works.

This film is quite good.

It's especially interesting in that it uses two performers from the original Broadway cast: Martha Scott as Emily, and Frank Craven as The Stage Manager.

A considerable drawback of the film version is that it has a happy ending.

In the play, Emily dies in childbirth.

Shortly after her on stage funeral, she finds herself seated among the Grovers Corners dead who are waiting patiently for their earthly desires and thoughts to be weaned away.

In both the film and the play, Emily is given the opportunity to relive one special day in her life.

In the play, she returns to her grave with the realization that we mortals undervalue each and every moment we have here on earth.

The play's final scene has George kneeling, overcome with grief, at Emily's grave.

Upon that, Emily comments to her deceased mother-in-law, ""Mother Gibbs, THEY (meaning George and the rest of the living) don't understand (meaning the value of every moment of life), do they?""

The film happy ending lacks the emotional blow to the gut which the stage version has.

Wilder took umbrage that the film version rewrote his powerful final scene.

He also disliked that the film used realistic scenery.

The play is meant to be performed on a bare stage.

No scenery whatsoever; except for a couple of ladders, two sawhorses and a wooden board (for the soda fountain scene), and a few chairs.

If you want to see Our Town as more in the direction of how Wilder intended the work to be staged, look up the old TV version with Hal Holbrook, Sada Thompson, and Barbara BelGedes.",1119139200,16,1686,4.687074829931973
682001,5,6303562515,"I just recently watched this DVD; borrowed from my daughter's friend. It's from Family Classics...it came in a set of DVD's with 50 classic films. This version tends to cut off the top of the frame and so every so often, people's heads are cut off at the forehead. But otherwise, it was an okay print. Sound not the best, but understandable if you are really paying attention. I have watched many films with worse prints, so this wasn't a real problem for me. Now to the movie: It was beautiful! I am 42 yrs. old and had never read the play or seen the film. I have enjoyed William Holden in many films and so wanted to see him in an early film. Was I surprised! To tell the truth, we were 1/4 of the way thru the film and I asked my daughter, ""When is William Holden going to show up?"" Honestly, I didn't even recongize him at first! He was so very young, so very different. He did great in this role; I was impressed with his performance of a somewhat shy and nervous school boy. His youthful beauty and innocence really shone out here. It took me 3 watches of this film to finally ""see"" William Holden in this film. Very weird! My favorite scenes with him were of course all the times he was talking with Emily, and also the talk with his father about chopping the wood for mother. It was so nice to see these 2 young people talking of their love for each other without ever using the word love! The film's style is very unique, having a narrator, and at first seemed very strange but then with the 2nd and 3rd watches, I really liked it. There was some good filming; clever film cuts/scene changes that I liked, such as Emily's bed quilt becoming the landscape, the little girl's feet cutting to chickens walking the same way... More than anything I just liked the simplicity of the story...the ordinary-ness of it, the truthfulness of it. I agree with another viewer here, how nice it would be to crawl into this film for a while and spend some time with these nice folks in this quiet little town. You just feel good watching this film. It makes you wish your own childhood could have been, and even your adult life could be so simple and nice, spent with such people. I smiled at lines like the one saying how the 2 mothers cooked hundreds of meals 3 times a day, etc. and never had a nervous breakdown. And what a nice ""piece of his mind"" father gave to his son (Holden's character)...gentle and loving, to the point, no anger or threats. Spoken so to even bring the son to tears of sorrow!  All of this film is just so very beautiful, the words spoken are just restful and beautiful. All the actors and actresses were so good for their roles. I am fine with the fact that Emily lives in the film. I am glad Holden's character didn't have to face such sorrow so early in his life. I suppose the dream was a bit strange, for I don't believe that is how dead people are, just talking like that, but it was a movie from long ago, and it was a dream so I don't mind it really. I think everyone should watch this film to just experience the beauty of it. I got the play from the library and it is nice to read these simple yet beautiful words, and picture the actors and actresses from the film as I read it. It is nice someone out there wrote a play that wasn't about strange weirdo people with weird perverse problems. This film and play are a breath of fresh air. So glad I watched it!

682007,3,6303562515,"I viewed OUR TOWN and what I saw was a high quality play mangled by some shoddy production values.  I saw the VHS version and what I expected to see was an entertaining film that explored Thornton Wilder's view of an pre-World War I small town America in terms of his quest for values that were cyclical in nature.  His play on paper asked the basic question: is there a purpose to life or are we doomed merely to re-enact the same dreary saga of birth, growth, death, and rebirth for all eternity?  This filmed version tried to answer that, but I literally could not see clearly the scenes in front of me and I kept hearing annoying noises that clouded the characters' parts.  Still, I tried to make sense of the movie.  The Stage Manager, a folksy-sounding avuncular type, sets Grover's Corners both geographically and socially in context so that the gradual exposition of the main leads, George and Emily, tend to be seen as a natural concomittant of this growth. We see them as youths with a youthful crush on each other.  We see that crush grow into a love and marriage that the Stage Manager suggests is not unlike that of all lovers in all eras.  During the time-travel sequence of the last act when Emily goes back to her childhood to see herself as her parents saw her is one of the key emotional scenes that suggest Wilder's emphasis that we had better pay attention to the present because if we do not, then the future may become blighted.  In the printed version Emily dies, but on film, Hollywood switched to a more upbeat ending that allows her to live. The theme of paying more attention to the present ought to have been extended to the shooting of this movie.  A better quality product of sight and sound might have negated the need for the viewer to shake his head in frustration over what he had trouble seeing and hearing on the small screen.",1026000000,7,1862,4.485207100591716

7850213,4,6303562515,"The narrator emerges from a ridgeline. Only a dark outline unlocking a fence on a hill overlooking Our Town in the stillness of the morning dusk. Our Town is small and well described and little changed from thirty years before. The narrator transforms the town to its 1910 self and calmly describes the social fabric and the dates of death of the unaware townsfolk, observed by the kindly narrator, who turns out to be a long dead druggist.
Thorton Wilder himself makes a cameo as he awkwardly recites sociological facts and history to us as the dead druggist looks at us with rolling eye patronizing. Our Town grows old as fate takes the fated.
A group of stars turns into the town dead calmly facing Judgement Day on the hill of the narrator. The cemetery hill. A young ghost of recent death is told that forgetting the old life becomes easier as judgement approaches. The glowing young female lives in her most ordinary mortal day to forget earthly life... only to remember how precious it was and then turns to us to plead that we must live fully while we can. The narrator leaves the hill and descends by the dark way he came being careful to close the gate.
Maybe it was the time these films were made but the small town macabre of OUR TOWN is echoed in THE HUMAN COMEDY with Micky Rooney made in 1942.

The charm of the play is its understatement and audience involvement, both impossible to capture in a film.

The main character is the stage manager who directly addresses the audience, brings in guest lecturers, fields questions from the audience, and fills in playing some of the roles. The play is performed without a set on a mostly bare stage. With a few exceptions, the actors mime actions without the use of props.""
