7816588,5,6301925750,"I have seen 'Neath the Arizona Skies many times, and I have suffered through numerous bad transfers with extremely poor pictures and terrible sound.  But now Olive Films has released this low budget film with a beautiful print and strong, steady sound.

Jonathan C. Pytko's review of this release of John Wayne's 1934 classic ""Lone Star"" Western in blu ray is right on target. I agree with his insightful review of 'Neath the Arizona Skies wholeheartedly, so please take a few minutes to read it.

While the quality of 'Neath the Arizona Skies is not TCM perfect, it is vastly better than any other version of this film that has been previously released by other companies.

The fact that Olive Films has apparently found good source materials for 'Neath the Arizona Skies is astounding, and I am hopeful that better source materials from more of John Wayne's early films still remain to be discovered.

The storyline in 'Neath the Arisona Skies is of a very warm and human nature.  Wayne is the guardian of a young Native Americsn girl named Nina Merrell, and he has cared for her since she was born.

The baby's mother died when she was born and her father then abandoned the child.  Wayne, who knew both parents, was present when the baby was born and vowed to raise the child as his own.

When the film opens ten years later, the young girl calls Wayne ""Daddy Chris"" and obviously loves him dearly. Wayne feels the same for his young ward, but wants to find her ""no good"" father and confront him about a number of issues.

Oil has been discovered on land owned by her birth father who has now been missing for years.  If the girl's father is pronounced dead, then she will be awarded a government ""oil"" check for $50,000, a huge sum in 1934.  In fact, that would be over $900,000 in today's dollars.

Actors John Wayne, Sheila Terry, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, Shirley Jane Rickert, Yakima Canutt, and the rest of the cast are all great in 'Neath the Arizona Skies.  And the cinematography in this so-called ""Poverty Row"" Western is amazing, showing a variety of rugged Western scenery.  And this Western contains plenty of medium shots and close-ups, a rarity in many films of this type.

So saddle up, cowboys and cowgirls, for 53 minutes of non-stop Western adventure with the Duke, his big white stallion, a cute Native American girl, beautiful Sheila Terry, and good ole Gabby Hayes.  Please, Olive Films, keep these great releases coming.",1506211200,2,2443,4.697183098591549
7816589,5,6301925750,"Thank you, Olive Films! I never thought that one of the Lone Star westerns would look this good, and am grateful for the effort taken to restore it to what must be very close to what original audiences would have seen. Unlike many other re-releases by bargain basement firms, there was NO added music--synthesized crap or otherwise, and NO dubbed voices. It amazes me that John Wayne fans have had to put up with several decades of sub-par prints or the truly awful ""additions"" made to the originals.

Olive Films, you have at least one willing buyer for any or all of the remaining fifteen Lone Star films that you will (hopefully) release in the future.

I would consider this a definitive release. As with the 1935-36 and 1938-39 Republic releases by the same company, it blows everything else out of the water. Seriously save the Walmart quality ""added"" music and voices for the two year-olds. That's about the intellectual level of someone who approves of the adulteration of eighty year-old films.",1500163200,,1003,4.825581395348837

7816594,5,6301925750,"All prints of this film which I have viewed are in rough shape. Synergy print is better than some , but for watching (contrast/ sound) I prefer the print issued by Platinum / Echo Bridge offered as a buy one - get one free. NOW JUST RELEASED (2012-2013) IS THE REMASTERED PRINT FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE! BY MR. FAT.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MINOR CHANGES IN THE MUSIC BACKGROUND - BUT THEY ARE MINOR AND GOOD.  THE PICTURE WILL BLOW EVERYTHING OUT THERE AWAY.  I JUST VIEWED THE FILM AND YOU WILL DO YOURSELF A DISERVICE IF YOU PURCHASE SOME OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE PUBLIC DOMAIN COPY.",1279065600,,581,4.462264150943396
