8592387,5,B00DDWRZ46,"I do love this movie- it sets the bar very high for what it wants to achieve,  . . . and it does.
Very tender scenes and dynamic characters you can relate/empathize with-
Actors are well cast-...reminds me of the family atmosphere that Boogie Nights had as well.
Definitely rent or buy- a great watch1",1428883200,,301,4.472727272727273
8592388,5,B00DDWRZ46,Truly one of the most amazing films from 2014. Full of emotions. Acting is stellar and is memorable long after the credits role. Great movie for those who really admire true cinema.,1427414400,,181,4.6875
8592389,5,B00DDWRZ46,"A teen coming of age film, rated R and deserves it, some pretty intense scenes. Tells intertwined personal stories set at an 80's roller rink. Check the trailer on youtube. If you like that you will love the film. Drunk battered Mom, gay coming out, usual teen boy and girl drama, but stories that pull you in. Film is 2 hours and 24 minutes. For me it brought back a lot of teen memories.",1426809600,,389,4.27027027027027
