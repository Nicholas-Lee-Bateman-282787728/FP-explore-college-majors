This was also the first place I studied ""Camera Raw"" ideas and Camera Raw Utility. the new panoramic layout modes and how to properly apply them to your panoramic images was useful to me. By the way, if you get excited about panoramic pictures there are two great books on this concept that use CS3 PhotoShop.
This is a comprehensive video and does go into sufficient details on the beginning concepts. However, if you are an advanced PhotoShop user then this might not be such a good one for you.",1240444800,,594,4.409090909090909
8210994,1,B000TUM950,"This was probably the worst ""how to"" video I've ever seen.  The narrator didn't seem sure of what he was doing and kept correcting himself.  As a neophyte Photoshop user I was looking for something more practical.....but it wasn't presented here.  It was a total waste of time, albeit amusing for its amateurish production values.",1233187200,,330,4.963636363636364
