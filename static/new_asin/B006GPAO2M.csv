8497703,1,B006GPAO2M,"This is a beautiful and haunting film from Germany, and the 1 star is certainly NOT for the film. It is for the rotten dvd.  This dvd from Vangaurd is shameful.  Obviously ripped directly from another source, throughout the entire running time, a rectangular shape can be seen in the upper right corner of the screen. It's only a shadow, but it is incredibly distracting.  The subtitles are awful, hardcoded and difficult to see.  Worst of all, this didn't even play on my older dvd player.  When inserted the player made an awful grinding noise and rejected the disc!  It's not defective, because it does play on the other dvd player.  the picture quality is soft, and blurry and not up to dvd standards.  I don't know if all films from VANGUARD get this same awful treatment, but this quality is so bad that I will never buy any film on the VANGUARD label again.  this is crap.",1349913600,,879,4.512658227848101
