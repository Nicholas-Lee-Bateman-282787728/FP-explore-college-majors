I guess, in 1969, if a woman wears a loose blouse, and the wind blows it open and allows a boob to fall out, then I guess that constitutes having an ""X"" rating.

But, even though it lacked nudity and sex, the story itself was so bland. I can't believe all the self-promoting hype that this film put out.  I've seen more nudity in Disney's ""Fantasia"" so I don't think I'd ever watch this lousy film again.  What a waste of my time!

2206035,3,B000795JN2,"99 WOMEN (aka: ISLAND OF DESPAIR) is a Women-In-Prison film from Director Jess Franco. It stars Herbert Lom as the eeevil Governor Santos, and Mercedes McCambridge as the sadistic Superintendent, Thelma. As expected, all of the female inmates are stunningly beautiful. Aside from sitting around looking lovely, there are the obligatory catfights and various sexual encounters. However, the order of the day for these girls is extreme punishment, and plenty of it! This results in many deaths (sorry torture fans, the deaths are implied). They also spend their days filling baskets w/ salt (?). Amazingly, this seems to have no ill effects on the women's complexions or fingernails! Governor Santos is perfectly revolting, and Thelma is a quintessential fascist. All is well for their little operation, until a reform-minded do-gooder arrives, putting their lecherous activities in jeopardy. Can Santos and Thelma find a way to get rid of her? If not, they'll lose everything they've worked so hard to build. Oh no! Three of the prisoners have escaped! They're running loose through the jungle! Here come the dogs! Run Women! Run! Thelma won't like this one bit! As WIP movies go, 99 WOMEN is OK. It has a cohesive storyline, and far less violence than many of these films, at least until the finale. It's only in the last 5 minutes that any real torture (as in PG-rated whippings) is administered. This leads to the inevitable uprising / riot. The revolt lasts almost half a second! THE END.

2206041,3,B000795JN2,"The mere mention of the name Jesus ""Jess"" Franco in the presence of movie fans will elicit several reactions. Some filmgoers will shrug their shoulders as if to say, ""Who's he?"" These people likely spend a lot of time watching big budget, multiplex friendly cinema. Other folks will smile. These film fans recognize this director's name in the context of ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""The Marquis De Sade's Justine,"" two Franco movies that actually contain a hint of style. Then there are the poor wretches who'll hear his name and visibly pale, groan as though they've eaten food that's given them salmonella poisoning, and slink quietly away into a corner for a few hours of serious sulking. I fall somewhere in between the last two categories. I liked ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""Justine,"" but I've also seen enough Franco films to understand the utter banality of a large segment of his filmography. ""99 Women"" is one of the director's contributions to a sleaze genre that could only exist in the 1970s and early 1980s, WIP (Women in Prison). Tons of these films exist, and most of them have come to DVD. Let's explore Jess's offering, shall we? Sure, we've nothing better to do!

O.k. ""99 Women"". Here we go. The film stars the luscious Maria Rohm as Marie, an unfortunate wretch sentenced to a term at a prison located on an island called, appropriately enough for the genre, Castillo de la Muerte. The Island of Death! With a name like that, any prisoner heading to the prison has to wonder what their future holds. Sort of makes Alcatraz look like a Club Med. Anyway, Marie heads to the island for some fun and sun with the other ninety-eight gals currently serving their sentences. We know there are ninety-eight other women in the jail because Marie receives an inmate number of ninety-nine upon her arrival. Get it? The Island of Death has ninety-nine prisoners, and the movie's called ""99 Women""! You simply must admire the internal logic on display here. Considering Franco isn't known for logical filmmaking, we must take what we can get whenever possible and move on. So Marie arrives in a sad state of affairs. She quickly realizes her new digs lack that special something found in the rest of civilization. It's a dump, in other words, and one run by a sadistic warden named Thelma Diaz (Mercedes McCambridge). Anyone care to bet Thelma and Marie won't get along?

Sure enough, Thelma and Marie soon lock horns. The trouble occurs when our heroine, while lounging about in her cell, hears the pitiful cries of a fellow inmate a couple of doors over. Oh, the humanity! When Marie attempts to notify the authorities about this terrible injustice, Thelma orders her thrown into a special detention cell. It's here that our gal meets up with Zoe (Rosalba Neri), the prison's resident Gertrude Stein (if you know what I mean) except far better looking. Hijinks of a decidedly fleshy nature ensue. It's somewhere around this time that we notice an important event, i.e. Franco's film actually has a plot. Thelma Diaz supplies the island's governor, Santos (Herbert Lom), with nubile women from the prison in exchange for favors. It doesn't seem to work, however, as a reformer from the mainland called Leonie (Maria Schell) arrives to inspect the facilities. She's heard horror stories about the shenanigans going on at the prison, and wants to make sure the inmates have an easier time on the island. Or something like that. Who cares, really? Expect a lot of sass, some cheesy fights, and an escape attempt that finds our heroine struggling to return to the world.

Also expect a lot of soft-core scenarios involving lots of lovely ladies. Rosalba Neri. Maria Rohm. A bunch of other 1970s exploitation babes. Rosalba Neri. Did I mention Rosalba Neri? Twice? Really? I wonder why that happened? These are the women of dreams, my friends, and Franco makes sure to throw in plenty of action to keep the male members of the audience fully entertained. As an added bonus the X-rated version of the movie tosses in a bunch of hardcore inserts. These sequences do absolutely nothing to move the plot along, nor do they involve the principal actresses. Yet somehow I didn't mind their presence in the picture even though they look like someone inserted them in the film with a sledgehammer. Another thing you might notice about ""99 Women"" is Franco's effort to inject a little class into the proceedings. Sure, we get his usual zoom and soft focus tricks, but we also see some stylistic touches sorely lacking in most WIP movies. For example, Rosalba Neri's striptease scene looks pretty darn good. Franco pulls this sequence off quite admirably. Now the negatives: a lame script, an unoriginal plot, and cheap production values all hurt the movie.

Apparently a couple of versions of ""99 Women"" are floating around in DVD land. I watched the X-rated version, which has the insert shots but lacks extras. According to a few reports I've read, another version (an unrated director's cut, I think) contains a lengthy interview with Franco, deleted scenes, trailers, and alternate footage. What a pity. What the distribution company should have done is release both versions of the film on one disc. Put the director's cut on side one, the X-rated cut on side two. Then sprinkle the extras on both sides of the disc. Is that so hard to do? I somewhat enjoyed the film, enough to give it three stars, but there's no way in heck I would shell out the bucks to buy both versions. I'm not that big of a Jess Franco fanatic. I only watch his movies because I feel I must in order to see as many exploitation films as possible. I recommend renting both versions, giving them a watch, and then deciding which one you wish to purchase. Good luck!",1180051200,8,5728,4.788675429726997

2206058,4,B000795JN2,"For some reason most of the reviews here are complaining about the X-rated French hardcore version, from people who say they'll never buy a Blue Underground dvd. Their loss.

The version I got was the ""director's cut"" (more accurately the producer's cut; I don't think Jess Franco had final cut on any of the movies he directed for Harry Alan Towers) and it's a blast, a fun Women In Prison flick that kick-started the genre as we know it.

The women are sexy, especially Rosalba Neri and Maria Rohm, and the movie is far less offensive than most later entries in the genre.

Blue Underground have done a good job with the DVD, presenting several deleted scenes (no hardcore inserts fortunately) and an excellent 19-minute interview with Franco. Best of all, the print is in beautiful shape.

2206059,2,B000795JN2,"{NOTE: There are two versions of this movie for sale on Amazon, both have been linked together; I'm reviewing the unrated director's cut not the x-rated French film}

1969 unrated director's cut.  The movie has numerous alternate titles, including: ""Isle of Lost Women,"" ""99 Donne,"" ""99 mujeres,"" ""Island of Despair,"" ""Prostitutes in Prison,"" ""The Hot Death""

DVD features: The DVD contains a copy of the unrated director's cut plus ""extras.""  The extras include: an interview with the director (""It was a time when the whole world was enjoying a freedom from censorship."" - well, I guess he censored himself then; interesting, after the fact some more ""hot"" scenes were added); deleted & alternate scenes (3; nudity (hard to see) in one scene); trailer (which appears to contain most of the nudity); poster & still galleries and some DVD-Rom feature that I couldn't access.

Credits: Mercedes McCambridge (Superintendent Thelma Diaz; Oscar nomination for ""Giant,"" won for ""All the King's Men""), Maria Schell (Superintendent Leonie Caroll; ""The Odessa File""), red-head Luciana Paluzzi (Natalie Mendoza), Rosalba Neri (Zoie; ""The Arena""), Maria Rohm (Marie), Eliza Montes (Helga), Valentina Godoy (Rosalie), and Herbert Lom (Governor Santos; ""The Pope Must Die"").  Written by Peter Welbeck.  Directed by Jess Franco (""Incubus"" (2002)).  Filmed on an island in the Mediterranean.

Plot: The movie is about a female prison located on an island off the coast of Panama.  The guards are ""sadistic"" (mostly occurs before the action or off-camera) and women are allowed to die (one shown).  Also, forced lesbianism ""abounds"" (ok, once).  Rumors float around saying that the new superintendent is a lesbian that is a little to close to the prisoners (spread by the ex-superintendent; their differences in discipline come into conflict).  Attempting to escape these ""horrible"" conditions, three women flee (Marie (prisoner 99), Helga (prisoner 97), and Rosalie (short red-headed girl)).  But one dies and the escaped prisoners are recaptured.  The prison erupts after the women are returned (not necessarily for that reason).

Review: Interesting, the unrated director's cut of a movie that was originally released as an X rated film with an original run time of 70 minutes (odd, both of my movie guides state that the film is around 90 minutes long and rated R (one believes it is a turkey)). If I'm reading the DVD correctly, the unrated version adds about 20 minutes of footage (but if my movie guides are correct, then no additional minutes are added).  One of the movie extras includes a news article about the film that notes that it is X rated and 70 minutes long, so I'm not sure what the real film length and rating was.

Good opening music.  A relatively slow movie, takes a while to get going (especially since they cut out the normal ""strip-search inspection"" of the new prisoners).  The prisoners wear the normal skimpy uniforms and girl fights occur, but the first nudity does not occur until around 23 minutes into the film.  The director is an ""artiste,"" and most of the ""nude"" sequences are artistically out of focus, or otherwise barely visible or very short (a shame considering some of the women are attractive).  The director also keeps annoyingly moving from out of focus to very close up shots in these types of scenes. A very disappointing movie, I should have paid attention to the critics (though they had seen the original film, not the ""director's cut""). As a ""mainstream"" movie it is disappointing, and as a ""nudie pic"" it is very disappointing.  Some of the actors, though, do seem to be able to act (though the new superintendent smiles too much, and prisoner 99 cries too much).

A very slow movie with surprisingly few nude scenes, and a lot less violence and sadistic guard action.  Going by the interview with the director, it would appear that the ""unrated"" version that I watched was actually one of the ""softer"" versions of the film (oh, and don't skip that interview, some of the missing ""harder"" scenes are included). The harder scenes were made by others and inserted into the film later (there are many versions of this film; and apparently one of the versions was at the top of the US box office at one point).

This film is junk. I also am really shocked at amazon carrying porn, and also I think Blue Undergound are actually breaking the law because this film is sold in all 50 states.

There ARE scenes of extreme sexuality (especially when you consider the film was released in 1969) which include (...). My big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film. In a few cases, they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching. Also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling (standing-in)for.

8046149,3,B000795JN2,"While Roger Corman gets most of the credit for popularizing the ""Women In Prison"" genre, producers as far back as the 1930s knew they had a moneymaker on their hands.  But it was the end of the Production Code that allowed filmmakers to push these seedy stories to their full potential, overtly wallowing in the sexual tension and brutal torture that previous productions only hinted at.  Director Jess Franco pursued this angle in several films throughout his extravagantly creepy career, beginning with 99 Women, which is actually the most polished and professional production of the bunch.

Working with frequent collaborator Harry Alan Towers, the pair concoct a relatively classy story about a fortress-like mountain penitentiary lorded over by the diminutive Thelma Diaz (Mercedes McCambridge) with frequent visits from the equally corrupt Governor Santos (Herbert Lom) who runs the men's prison on the other side of the island.  The script picks up with the addition of a trio of new prisoners, bringing the tally to a full 99 desperate and sexually frustrated women, each with a convenient flashback to the crimes that landed them on the ""Castle of Death.""

For the most part Franco dodges the sloppy sex scenes and outright sadomasochism of his later films thanks to tremendous acting from McCambridge, Lom and particularly Maria Schell (The Odessa File), underplaying her role as new warden who threatens Diaz's comfortable routine of whippings and solitary confinement.  Even the cast of prisoners, which includes familiar faces like Rosalba Neri and Luciana Paluzzi, bring a convincing amount of gravitas to their roles, managing to keep the situation from sliding in outright camp as the genre was poised to do with Corman's Filipino productions.  In short, 99 Women actually feels like a real movie rather than a collection of exclamation points.

A big reason for this is the lush score from composer Bruno Nicolai that punctuates the action masterfully, making the entire production feel like a movie twice its size.  Underneath it all is the expected layer of Franco sleaze, including the required girl-on-girl action and multiple gang rapes, none of which would earn more than a R-rating today (in fact, Franco's first lesbian scene is such an out-of-focus, confusing mess, it's difficult to say who's doing what to whom!).  But it's all pretty tepid titillation compared to the director's later filmography and easily digestible as a mainstream prison movie.  Franco's trick is making it feel like forbidden fruit, a lesson Corman and those who followed in his footsteps learned only too well.

Blue Underground revisits the title with a 3-Disc Unrated Director's Cut sporting a brand new 4K high-definition transfer, bonus DVD copy and (yes!) soundtrack CD.  Franco's back catalog has been slowly seeping onto the Blu-ray format, but this is hands-down the best his work has ever looked.  And the feature is supported by slate of great bonus features, including an 18-minute interview with the late director, a historical breakdown with film historian Stephen Thrower, some lengthy deleted and alternate scenes (sourced from VHS but greatly appreciated), liner notes and the aforementioned soundtrack from Bruno Nicolai.",1480896000,,3240,5.278210116731517

Ever since Arrow started releasing movies on BluRay for 30-35 bucks, every company has been raising prices to see how far fans are willing to go to shell out for these old movies.  These companies play on our nostalgia.  Many of these films were never worth this, even on old VHS tapes.  I for one am done with it.  If a film like this continues to be priced over 25 bucks, they can keep it.  Either they will drop prices or they will be forced to stop making BluRays.  Enough of this.  I know that no one is forcing us to pay these prices, but if you love these older films like I do, you feel violated. I usually LOVE Blue Underground.  It is owned by Bill Lustig who is an amazing guy, a great director and an inspiration to many of us, I cannot understand how this has happened.  I know he always tried to bring us great quality at good prices.  These prices are bad enough when it is an import and there are currency differences and actual fees to bring it to America in the mail, but for a USA release to be this high is nonsense.  I'm done.  I have both versions on DVD that I got for under $20 for both.  I'll keep it.",1480118400,,1317,4.191235059760956

8046152,5,B000795JN2,"First, this is a porn movie regarding sexual abuse in a women jail.  The Governor controls.  A female Inspector / Auditor simply cannot help or
rescue the victims. Yes, the wicked Governor raped an inmate (#99) repeatedly. She joined a plan to escape.  Once outside to the jungle, it is
more dangerous than before.  Why?  These female escapees are hunted by guards And male prisoners escaping from another cell.

The final chapter is for the Inspector to leave without any improvement to the security / health of inmates.  Inmate #99 is to get back to her cell.
A horror movie in a sense.",1468627200,3,588,4.650485436893204

8046154,4,B000795JN2,Loved the film but could not play any of the extras ( which amounts to about an hour) that are on the DVD. I have three DVD machines and none of them would play the click ons. The disk must have been pressed wrong and is defective. I have just contacted Amazon  for a replacement. Wish me luck.,1452038400,2,294,4.068965517241379
