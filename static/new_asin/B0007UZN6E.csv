8052177,5,B0007UZN6E,"Having studied with Master Joe Lewis this DVD is a Treat. Its like having him teach you how to take care of yourself in empty hand self-defense. Joe Lewis is a Legend, a Great Karate Fighter and Teacher. He was a Cool Dude. In hand to hand combat he was amazing. He was a great Full Contact Kickboxer. He taught fighters, police, FBI and Special Units of the US Armed Forces. In this DVD he teaches 10 of his favorite techniques for self-defense. He lets you know this is not the end all. He tells you this is a journey into your own development to discover what you need to do if you need to take care of business. I love the part on ethics and fighting mindset. He explains everything completely. Like the Side Kick, Front Kick, Sunday Punch, Throws, Locks and Holds.  Just like he did in his classes and seminars. Thank you Joe for all you gave us. We all miss you in the Karate and martial arts community. RIP. God bless you.",1377734400,3,929,4.278409090909091
