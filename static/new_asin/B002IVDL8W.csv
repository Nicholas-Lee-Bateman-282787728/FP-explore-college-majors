3937306,5,B002IVDL8W,"I watch ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" on occasion and stumbled across this film going through NetFlix's instant watch movies. I am interested in pageant life so decided to read what it was about. That's when I found out it was a drag queen competition. Hello, that peaked my interest even more. It's an interesting film for those who don't know much about what drag queens actually do to get ready to perform. It allows us a quick glimpse into this portion of their lives and why they do it. The queens themselves are articulate and intelligent and seem to know themselves very well. I learned a few things about how they achieve their looks, but would liked to have learned more. That said, this isn't a ""how to become a drag queen"" movie so you can't really give it marks off for not doing so. If you enjoy the art of drag queens and want to learn more about a few of them, then this is a good film.",1259366400,8,893,4.321428571428571

3937330,5,B002IVDL8W,There was less pageant (A little disappointed) and more about a few of the contestants than I expected. There was someone in the pageant that competed on Drag Race  (shown near the end - a nice surprise) :->  Overall I did enjoy it.,1383436800,,232,4.372093023255814
3937331,5,B002IVDL8W,"I absolutely love this film.

Pageant is a 2008 documentary film directed and produced together by Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern. The film explored the behind-the-scenes dramas and realities of the 34th Miss Gay America Contest. The film's central theme was the universal desire to be beautiful, noticed and chosen. The film garnered 10 film festival awards before airing on the Sundance Channel in 2010.

While some reviewers, such as Martin Tsai from The Village Voice felt that the film only skimmed along the surface insanity saying that ""filmmakers Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut's treatment is only skin-deep, eschewing any exploration of gender politics or psychological effects induced by the ubiquitous ugly-duckling-turned-swan narrative."" Other reviewers such as Nathan Lee in the New York Times felt that it was ""not without its charm, and it's touching, in a goofy sort of way, to see how seriously everyone takes it."" George Williamson in An Eye for Film described it as ""... an entertaining portrait of some wonderfully larger than life characters, a mind blowing amount of effort and an incredible desire to win.""

Audience reviews were generally positive. Michael Klemm from Cinemaqueer recommended it saying ""If you just want a good time, you can't go wrong with Pageant. Anyone who likes to indulge their inner divas should be enthralled."" Rotten Tomatoes posted an 85% approval rating.

I however personally recommend this film to all supporters of colorful drag queens and even ""RuPaul's Drag Race"".

Regardless of what the reviews say, this is a buried treasure .. and very hard to find at that.

It's definitely worth the time and investment. You will really enjoy this.",1380499200,2,1702,5.216117216117216
3937332,4,B002IVDL8W,"Founded in 1972, The Miss Gay America pageant is not a glorified drag show; it is instead a surprisingly disciplined display of the ancient art of female impersonation, an art that has only recently gained respectability in the United States.  PAGEANT documents the 2006 contest, held in Memphis, Tennessee, by following a number of the contestants who reveal how they became involved in female impersonation and the difficulties they have faced both on stage and off.  Even so, PAGEANT is not a cat-fight, or a I-Have-Suffered portrait; it is plain fun.

The fifty contestants are drawn from an original five hundred and are whittled down through various specific contests and competitions such as Talent, Solo Talent, Evening Gown, and so on.  These contests are held at various night clubs, and it is not until the final night of judging that the event moves onto the big stage, where it plays out in a style not unlike the Miss America pageant.  PAGEANT follows a number of contestants.  Some make it into the ""top ten"" finalists; some do not.  Although each is interesting, two are particularly so: Victoria ""Pork Chop"" Parker and Coti Collins.  Parker is a big man and he makes for a plus-sized woman--and there is no denying his power as an entertainer pure and simple.  Collins is perhaps the ultimate professional, a female impersonator who has worked with such stars as Reba McIntyre and who tours the country on a regular basis.

Although PAGEANT doesn't dwell on it, much of the documentary's interest arises from ""how do they do that?""  Backstage glimpses offer a few answers, some of which seem very uncomfortable.  The regimine the performers follow is strict, and although it seems all the contestants try to psych each other out, and although underhanded viciousness is occasionally hinted at, most of contestants are class acts.  PAGEANT may not have the visceral snarl of the early drag documentary THE QUEEN, and it isn't as deadly in its point of view as the ultra-acid 1970s satire SMILE, but it is fun to watch, no doubt about it.

3937335,5,B002IVDL8W,What can I say I saw this once and was hooked its my performers bible for those who do not understand what performing is like or how hard we work to do it watch this and understand  its not easy also its lovely to see how many who did not crown that year go on to winning!,1364688000,,272,3.7719298245614037

3937339,5,B002IVDL8W,"Considering I bought this just to see my friends in the movie, and I have been to more pageants that I care to mention, this movie really surprised me.  I truly enjoyed it.  It presented the world of female impersonation, without being demeaning or derogatory in any sense.  It showed the actual work that goes into the art, and the passion which most of these ""girls"" have to strive to be the best.  I believe anyone even remotely interested in doing pageants, or even just wanting to perform should watch this movie.  A true testament to the art!",1348185600,4,548,4.551020408163265
3937340,5,B002IVDL8W,From Start to finish I loved this film and everything about it. I hope to see many more films like it. It is well worth the cost to rent/buy it.,1339632000,,144,3.8333333333333335
3937341,5,B002IVDL8W,"If you're a drag queen, know someone who is, or just love female impersonation and illusion, then you will love ""Pageant"". I was on the edge of my seat until the very end, and it was truly an exciting experience waiting to see who won. The story telling was masterfully done, and I was able to personally connect with many of the contestants. This is definitely a must-see.",1330646400,2,373,4.5

3937343,5,B002IVDL8W,The movie is interesting if you are interested in something very different about a subculture. Read about the movie before you watch it because this will not be for everyone.,1271376000,,174,4.833333333333333
3937344,4,B002IVDL8W,"Each year since 1973, a group of crossdressing gay men has gathered to crown the new Miss Gay America. Pageant is a documentary focusing on the 2006 contest in Memphis.

The fascinating aspect of Pageant is its people. It is always revealing to watch a person who becomes immersed in a hobby. These men have become so enamored of chasing the title that they reveal themselves unintentionally in many ways.

The amount of time and effort that the characters devote to the pageant is amazing. Some of the performances in the contest are amazing. The film draws the viewer in so that the viewer feels for the men who do not place in the coveted Top Ten.

Pageant is a fun look at a subculture about which most of America knows nothing.",1267574400,3,732,4.53030303030303

3937346,5,B002IVDL8W,"I was told about this film by a friend, so I decided to take a chance on it.  Documentaries are my favorite genre of filmmaking and I hadn't seen anything on this topic before.  I was completely enchanted by this wonderful and profoundly moving film.  I found it engaging on so many levels, from the personal profiles of contestants it followed to the suspenseful buildup to the big Miss. Gay America Pageant itself.  Only those with deep-seated antipathy toward gays, or hearts of stone, will walk away from this beautiful little gem unaffected.

At various points in the film I found myself thinking that if the subject matter were different this might well have been an Oscar contender.  Anyway, watch it - it's a top-flight human interest story about the importance of dreams from the perspectives of a bunch of serious and seriously funny queens!",1263340800,7,851,4.834482758620689
