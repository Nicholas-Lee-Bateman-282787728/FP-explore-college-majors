3731484,3,B001OQ17SI,"I just picked up the video today.  As I had heard, the Warner Bros people reduced us to just highlights of the Super Bowl (and playoff games).  Why do they do this?  I imagine to sell a subsequent dvd with the entire SB game.  This is a real disappointment, particularly if you don't know it going in.  On the positive side, you do get to enjoy the Steelers radio broadcast team of Hargrove and Ilkin narrate the highlights and the behind the scenes comments of players and Coach Tomlin are priceless (although I haven't watched the whole thing yet).

I'd give it five stars if WB had done the right thing and given us the entire SB XLIII broadcast.  I call it corporate greed.  Don't corporations that act like this make you proud to be an American capitalist?  Yeeehaaaa!",1235433600,,773,4.503597122302159

This is basically a yearbook of the Steelers' 2008 season -- a ""Season Review"" which contains highlights of all the Steelers' games, including the Super Bowl. It also contains various extras. It definitely does not include the complete Super Bowl. If you're looking for a review of the season, this is your purchase. If you're looking for Super Bowl XLIII on DVD/BluRay, I'm pretty certain they'll be releasing that before too long as well.

But from what i've heard and read, this DVD DOES NOT include the entire game uncut. This is only highlights and stories. I've already heard a mention of watching ""the complete game"". I don't believe you're going to get it here. Just as the '05 was released as highlights and such and they finally released the whole game w/the other 3 playoff games as a 4-disc set.

It also  includes the 4th Q of the Cowboys game, wherein the Steelers make a big comeback and embarrass the Cowboys and Tony Romo.  But it was in December, when Dallas makes its annual swoon.

There isn't a replay of the Super Bowl game itself.  If you want that you'll need to buy a copy of Pittsburgh Steelers: Road to Super Bowl XLIII, which has replays of the December photo finish game against the Ravens (in Baltimore), plus replays of both playoff victories and the Super Bowl itself.

Had to listen to it in Stereo because 5.1 surround on the PS3 kept cutting the volume to a super low level every time commentator spoke.  Very annoying.  Not sure if it's this Blue Rays 5.1 or the way my PS3 interprets it.  I do have MLB world series Blue ray, and that plays perfectly fine in 5.1.  Shrug.

Good video for Steeler fans to own, but as I said in title, does not compare to their previous Superbowl DVD XL in terms of emotion and pride.  This Blue Ray just tells the story in a boring style manner, not much work seemed to go into it as previous one, so it seemed.

The entire 16 game season is covered in a half an hour, with remarkable comebacks and potentially devastating injuries (Ben dying on field in the Cleveland game, for instance) glossed over in order to quickly get to the playoffs and Super Bowl.  It looks and sounds fantastic (especially the Blu-ray, which also has the 4th quarter of the Dallas game), but it really does seem like Dwight ""Hands Of"" Stone was given this to edit together (a lot of no-brainers left on the cutting-room floor).  As many others have said, the 4-game Road To XLIII comes out June 2nd, featuring the 13-9 Baltimore nail biter along with the 3 playoff games, so for those of you saying, ""Yinz guyz jipped me,"" I hope you have a spare $40-$50 ready for that.",1236816000,,942,4.595238095238095

it was the toughest game by game schedule in the NFL, to winning
5 or more games in the last 2 minutes INCLUDING the Super Bowl!!
I could not wait to get my DVD which I ordered the same night or the
next morning after the superbowl game!! I just wanted to watch
that amazing season in a slower state of mind!! I wanted to actually
see the plays and heart pounding comebacks vs having my head bowed in a terrible towel! :--) I wanted to get the always fantastic music
and quality commentary one always gets on this type of DVD, as each game and each week consumed itself to the eventual stunning Super Bowl victory... I figured this was a slam dunk easy to paint and present us a Mona Lisa as they have all the data and info already on film!!
If there were other DVDs available, I would toss this in the trash.
Its a B- effort and season synopsis regarding a A+ season! It barely touches on the Steelers beyond fantastic, moving, injury filled, incredibly difficult, comeback game after game, season!! The DVD given todays technolgy, commentators able to add or delete the play by plays after the fact, could have been so much better IMO. As nothing else is available, ya gotta have it :------) So buy it, enjoy it! Lordy having a corner on the market shows what happens to quality! Again I give a B- grade on what should have been a easy A+ DVD.

3731552,5,B001OQ17SI,"Why are Steeler fans so surprised that this is a season highlight DVD? Just 3 years ago NFL Films did the same thing: released the highlight DVD shortly after Super Bowl XL and released the entire set of playoff games later in the year. The Super Bowl XL DVD was amazing - this one falls slightly short of that, but it's definitely worth a buy for any Steeler fan. Relax, you'll get your entire Super Bowl XLIII later this year... but what NFL Films does here is to try and tell the story of the 2008 Steelers like a movie. The Super Bowl win is even more amazing in the context of the season that led up to it.
Oh, and the two minute clip featured above, it is in the DVD, it's just been recut. The version you see up there is probably from a rough cut, which is normal in video and film editing. They punched up the narration a bit and used some different angles in the final cut, but the clip gives you a good sense of the DVD.",1236211200,2,930,4.087431693989071
3731553,4,B001OQ17SI,"As a long-time Steelers fan, this DVD was a must buy and I'm happy I did it.  BUT, the Superbowl is not complete, just a series of clips.  Too bad too becuase Superbowl XLIII is a game I could watch over and over to see the great plays both by the Steelers like Harrison's record interception+return and Santonio Holmes' spectacular series of catches on the last offensive drive, as well as the great almost-comback by the Cardinals, a team that got no respect during the regular season and had to earn it the hard way in the postseason.

My problem with the DVD is that unlike many of the NFL's productions this one has no heart, no stortelling, no reason to care, presented in the program.  This DVD gives you a striaght-up prestantion of the games with all the wit and charm of a statistician.

It starts off just right with the emotionally honest speech by Hines Ward regarding the possible retirement of Jerome Bettis.  Great stuff.  The closest this program gets is the exchange between Ward and Limas Sweed - good stuff but there were MANY great storylines that went into this season.  Some people think NFL films are too melodramatic, personally I love the over-the-top drama and I can't believe they would lose the oportunity to present some great stories.

Here's just a few that jump to mind!
The injury to longtime backup Charlie Batch that led to Byron Leftwich stepping up to help play strong.
The emphasis on discipline in training camp that got Casey ""Big Snack"" Hampton some press before the season started.
The long road and perseverance of James Harrison who made Defensive player of the Year (a fact BARELY mentioned on the DVD).
Hines Ward's drive to play in the Superbowl despite a knee injury two weeks earlier against Baltimore.
Oh, and lets not forget the faceoff between Mike Tomlin and Ken Wisenhunt/Russ Grimm after they all vied for the headcoaching gig in Pittsburgh two years prior.
Any or all of those would have been great to hear about but we got next to nothing on the main program, just scattered in the bonus material or completely ignored.

Griping aside, the production is nicely done and the inclusion of the 4th quarter of the Dallas game (at least on the Blu-Ray DVD) is a nice touch - but even then they cut it too short and left out the bone chilling battle cry by Nate Washington shortly after an ankle injury, a moment I was dying to see again!  I hope NFL films has a few other productions planned to give this season its due.",1236124800,2,2810,4.942675159235669

Super Bowls are not 90 minutes and common sense should tell you that this is a Super Bowl highlight dvd as well as highlights of a Super season. If you are looking for the entire uncut dvd of the playoffs and the Super Bowl, well that will be out later in the year.

what i thought i was buying here after seeing the advertisements for it.

This DVD only shows 12 minutes of Super Bowl 43 ( starting at 55 min into the disc ) and i feel i have been cheated yet again by Warner Bros. If i may mention Super Bowl 9 from my other set they are selling on DVD. They advertised it to be the complete unedited original television broadcast and you open the DVD after you sent them your money and BAMMN and big disclaimer stating some plays may be missing.

Misleading people to take their money is theft. They mentioned the technology back in super bowl 9 didn't permit them to make a quality product,  yet i have Movies on DVD from before that time period and they
look allot better . Super Bowl 9 Looked like a bootleg VHS copy that had been copied over and over again.

Anyways mislead/ripped off again !!!!",1235865600,,980,4.252688172043011
3731558,2,B001OQ17SI,I purchased this DVD for my son because he was unable to watch the Super Bowl this year with his Steelers playing in it. We both thought the entire Super Bowl XLIII would be included on this DVD. He was very disappointed after watching this and so was I. This DVD is okay with all the highlights but that is just not the same as watching the entire game.,1235779200,2,354,4.144927536231884
3731559,3,B001OQ17SI,"As a Steelers fan, I could not wait for this DVD to be released.  And as someone who always enjoys a good NFL Films Production, I assumed this DVD would be just as good, if not better, than the Super Bowl XL release outlining the 2005/2006 Steelers season.
Unfortunately, I feel NFL Films fell short with this DVD and that they rushed this into production.  They missed the mark somewhere and made the season seem somewhat dull.  (Something we all know was NOT the case!)
SPOILER ALERT:  The 2 minute clip viewable on Amazon is not even in the DVD . . .odd.
Of course, this review is not meant to deter any of you from purchasing this DVD.  Nor, is it meant to downplay the amazing season the Steelers played.  The bonus material is enjoyable to watch and any fan will be happy to add this to their collection. But once again, a bit of a disappointment in comparison to the Super Bowl XL DVD.
As a reminder, this DVD does NOT contain the Super Bowl XLIII game.  This is merely a collection of clips from the 2008/2009 season.",1235433600,19,1025,4.363157894736842
3731560,5,B001OQ17SI,"To those of you who are angry that this doesn't include the entire game: Please settle down.

NFL Films releases a season highlight DVD for the Super Bowl champ every year. And that is followed with the complete playoff and Super Bowl games in their entirety as a separate offering.

This is, in my opinion, better than simply a replay of the game. (The NFL Network aired the full game about 50 times in the week following the Super Bowl.) This includes field and locker room access that only NFL Films can provide. Like the Super Bowl XL DVD, this is an incredible highlight reel of an amazing season and a must-have for any true Steelers fan.",1235433600,,644,4.495726495726496
