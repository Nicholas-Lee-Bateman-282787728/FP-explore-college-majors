Synopsis: A chance meeting while shopping for a pair of men's pajamas occurs between Amar (Himanshu Malik) and Lekha (Mallika Sherawat), two attractive, young college students.  They hit it off immediately and from that moment on find themselves spending every free moment together. As time passes their initial light hearted, sarcastic banter slowly gives way to more serious, intimate conversation. A marriage proposal soon follows and that's when their romantic dream is forced to confront some of the everyday realities of life.

What problems you ask? Why the usual ones, gaining the acceptance of your future in-laws, overcoming the differences in social standing, dealing with all the everyday financial problems and most important of all learning to understand and communicate with your mate.

Critique: The central theme of the 2003 film `Khwahish' (meaning ""the wish) is learning to cope with the drudgery and routines of life that drain our energy, our aspirations and ultimately our time. The storyline moves back and forth between several movie genres to get its message across; romantic comedy, drama and finally bittersweet romance. While this blending of genres is commonplace in Hindi cinema I don't think it worked very well in `Khwahish'.

Another disappointment was the lack of chemistry I perceived between the two stars Himanshu Malik and Mallika Sherawat. They definitely made for a great looking couple but looks can only hold your interest for so long. Of course I'm certain all the Himanshu and Sherawat fans will disagree with me and love every minute.",1305504000,,1641,5.272030651340996
