5124189,5,B00827OX5Q,"This is by the best 9/11 documentary I have seen so far. It not only portrays the World Tade Center, but EVERYTHING that happened that day, including the Pentagon, flight 93, Washington and much more.

This one really hit home with me and brought out allot of emotions. There is great footage from different angles, lots of good audio and interveiws with everyone from the President and thier wifes, to the flight controllers and even some of the terrorist.

The last 9/11 dvd I bought was just about New York and I was really seeking something that showed the whole story and this hit the spot. I still have yet to see the plane before it hits the Pentagon. I can see a second of debris and smoke, then a large explosion, but why did that camera veiw not capture the plane? I would think that the Pentagon would have a ton of cameras and be able to catch more than they did, or are showing the public. If anyone knows of any such footage, please let me know.

All in all, this is worth the money and then some. Great video and audio. It really puts you there on that that day . Thank you Smithsonian !!",1353628800,8,1103,4.293269230769231

5124192,5,B00827OX5Q,"There are days that one will never forget, or should be forgotten - whether you were alive or not. 9/11 is one of those days when history pivots and the world changes. This DVD has 2 sections; 9/11: Day that Changed the World and 9/11: Stories in Fragments.

The first is 1 hour and 32 minutes long. It begins at 6:30 am with President Bush and his morning run. It proceeds to tell how the leaders of America responded to the events of that day. We hear interviews of many and their recollections; Rudy Giuliani, Donald Rumsfeld, Laura Bush among others. The interviews are interesting and the focus is at least divided into that of the Pentagon and Flight 93 as well as the World Trade Center. Too many times, documentaries only focus on New York.
Much of the time during this segment is spent on Air Force One's 9 hour flight.

The second part deals with objects the Smithsonian has collected and interviews from survivors, friends and relatives of those who died.  We see pieces of aircraft, phones on which calls from loved ones were received, uniforms and badges, a briefcase blown out of the World Trade Center as it fell and was returned to its owner who had evacuated the building. This part is 46 minutes long.

This is a good recollection of that day. Mechanically it is extremely hard to get to the 2nd feature, at least on my DVD. I have to forward from the beginning to get to the second, the menu doesn't work. There are also no closed captions, which is irritating for those with hearing loss.
Still it is well worth a reminder of the day that changed the world.",1349395200,7,1577,4.484320557491289
8524196,5,B00827OX5Q,tremendous historical insights for youngsters who were not alive when the events of 9/11/2001 changed the way western nations viewed national security and public safety.,1509062400,,169,5.8
8524197,5,B00827OX5Q,"Good quality documentaries. Provides a great look back at a dark time in history. Would strongly recommend that should you be considering buying this to share a bit of history with children, please note they show lots of original media clips and such. I would think a teenager could handle this documentary. But I wouldnt go much younger than that. I will say I bought it so that once I feel my son is old enough to handle the imagery we would already have it on hand.",1503878400,,468,4.390804597701149
