Little Time is..Appeals to all ages..My only complaint is where is the rest of this show..There are still 2 episodes missing from the dvds..Including my fav one where they play sick and then everyone gets sick for real. And there are about 3 unaired episodes. Its been almost a year since vol 4 hope they didn't forget. And the bloppers on here are HILARIOUS too. The character of Maneulo is classic tv comedy character. A laugh riot. And you get to see new sides to the Twins too including rocker
metal girls in leather and wild hair just to name one (episode Girls just want to have fun NOTE:This one is on vol 1).There are many suprises. A JOY all the way around. Get all of this show. Its one of the best shows in years. I also want to say where is TWO OF A KIND?? GET THIS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPIONTED AND GET OLSENIZED with solittletime dvdseries......",1074643200,2,918,4.343023255813954
1840879,5,B00008DZ88,"I love so little time. It really reflects off of what a real teen is like. But I don't like the way they show off clothes. Allof their clothes look like they would be 1,000 dollars each outfit, and normal teens don't dress like that. I am also very mad that they are making a PG-13 movie even though I will see it. They are loved by children and some teens and i don't think they should stop having movies for kids yet.",1067817600,2,419,4.0602409638554215

7982118,3,B00008DZ88,"So Little Time was a very cute series, I enjoyed it when I was a pre-teen, each episode made me laugh. I think the reason it ended so fast was because there wasn't enough of a long term story line to keep the series going. The mother and father were still obviously in love and the moment they got back together the show ended, and if they didn't angry viewers would make the show end.

I also didn't like the way that Riley treated Larry, he worshiped her and she used him like a tissue. She let him follow her around like a lap dog and then didn't date him. I thought he was cute.

I would still recommend the series.",1372550400,,619,4.107438016528926

7982120,3,B00008DZ88,"The show is fun for any age, and it's great that they have several DVDs with the archived episodes. I have to say, though, that this DVD could have been so much more!  First of all, the ""photo album"" that is included consists of what, about 5-10 screen caps from the included episodes?  Would it have been too difficult to include more, better quality images from the show?  Or some of the rest of the cast?  It just seemed like a pointless addition to feign a DVD jam-packed with extras.  The bloopers were fine enough, but then we get to the ""interactive quiz"" where you take the time to run through the questions but then receive no score!  I felt like it was incomplete little exercise, even if you are told after each question whether you got it correct.  I don't know.  Anyway, I guess I just thought that it could have been a better DVD with a little more effort.  Still, cute show, and I am an Olsen fan nevertheless.",1085270400,3,925,4.362573099415204
