8035440,1,B0002ZYE0U,"AN OLD DONNIE YEN MOVIE. THE DVD COVER IS MISLEADING, BECAUSE YEN DOES NOT DO ANY KUNG FU FIGHTING. HE IS A
DETECTIVE.PICTURE IS FUZZY.I DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL.",1310947200,,160,4.193548387096774
8035441,1,B0002ZYE0U,"What ever you do, don't buy this even if the price drops down

to two pennies.  If there was a ZERO to rate this movie I give

it one.  This is a fine sample of false advertisement.  They

put the cover of Donnie Yen in a most muscular pose, making the

consumer think they're going to see an spectacular Shaolin temple fight.  This movie doesn't even show Kung Fu or any

type of martial arts.  This is outrageous!  I was going to ask

for a refund but sending the movie back would cost more then

what it's worth.  The story is a rediculous cop story with no

Shaolin fighting what so ever.  As a matter fact this is one

of Donnie Yen's very first movies,  He looks like a nerd!

real skinny wearing glasses! When was this movie shot? in the

early eighties?  Don't expect to see the Donnie Yen in the

false advertisement cover of this Movie.  Or the Donnie Yen

from ""Iron Monkey"" or ""Fist of Fury"" - This movie,""Fist of Fury"" is a remake of the late Bruce Lee ""Chinese Conection"" by Donnie Yen, this movie is the one to own! Get ""Fist of Fury"" by Donnie Yen.  He is in the best shape of his life.  The action is nonstop from begining to end.  No wire work here, except for some fast forward on some scenes to make him look speedier then Bruce.  Shaolin  vs Devil's Omen, if they offered it free I

wouldn't take it! The space on my shelf is worth more.

So Halloween movie hunters, BEWARE!",1126828800,51,1395,4.190114068441065
