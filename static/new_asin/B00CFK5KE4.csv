5721532,4,B00CFK5KE4,"Frankly, I'm forced to give this four stars only because my niece loves it so much she'd disown me forever if I dare speak ill of her Wheels on the Bus. I'm not sure why but children are mesmerized by the poor production and silly graphics. It must be the catchy tunes that they will play over and over until you are singing ""Fill it up fill it up, the bus won't go unless you give it some gas. Fill it up all the way. You gotta fill it up if you wanna play!"" in your sleep. On your way to work. Cooking dinner. Walking the dog. This series will drive you mad... but it'll entertain your kiddos!",1445472000,2,595,4.0508474576271185

8581314,1,B00CFK5KE4,"I have two children, a 9 year old and 2 year old. As someone who has been a mom for almost a decade, I can say that these DVD's are wthout a doubt the most obnoxious children's show ever created. Everything from the animation to the music (especially the music), to the acting and costumes makes me want to bang my head against a wall, simply for a distraction. The dragon is so annoying, worse than Barney! The songs are awful, like really bad. You would think that Wheels on the Bus is pretty standard, but they found a way to make it the most annoying song on the planet. So, if you hate your children, and yourself, then I would recommend these DVD's. If not, put your money towards some entertainment that won't make you want to hide in a closet with a glass of wine until it's over.",1493251200,,788,4.26
