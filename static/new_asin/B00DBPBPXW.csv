5787604,5,B00DBPBPXW,My 8 yo son loves football and Walter Payton is his favorite player of all time. So I got this DVD for him to use for a school project. They were instructed to use any material except the internet to gather information (I love that!). This DVD made Walter Payton literally come to life for him! It was amazing to see. That was a great Sunday afternoon together for the whole family (we watched it together).,1457913600,3,407,4.368421052631579
