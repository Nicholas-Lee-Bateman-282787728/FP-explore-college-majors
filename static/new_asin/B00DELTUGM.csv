8592592,5,B00DELTUGM,"This father-son-dog story is not a ""dog"" story but a ""tides of change"" and ""human cost"" story. Traditional values & relationships among people, between humans & animals, between humans & the earth are disrupted, beings displaced and dis-empowered. With a light touch of humor and documentary type realism, this powerful work from Tibet's ""new wave cinema"" award-winning director leads to a shocking (yet inevitable?) ending.

I first saw it on the big screen at a film festival in Brooklyn where it took best narrative prize.  I am old enough to have grown up with films and family memories of the great depression and relatives who lost their land (though lucky enough to find new start in American northwest).  This film revived deep memories of the sorrow and distress when the family was deprived of both ability and opportunity to live directly from nature as humans have done since time began until very recent times (my life time).

(PS  Few people I know now know what meat really tastes like.  Never tasted fresh clean meat from healthy animals raised on natural grazing land and fresh killed - sorry, but meat comes from killed animals - and natural all the way to the table. Sweet juices of fresh meat. Sweet and healthy raw, too.  Milk direct from a healthy, grass grazed cow is like heavenly dew.  You've never had it. People in this film lived all their lives eating this way until recently.)

Globally nomads and farmers have been and are being pushed into the ""modern world"" and into lives of dependence on the whims of ""man"" (politicians, ""developers"", corporations), not nature. Scares me. Just one generation back, all of my family knew how to live quite successfully on the land, meeting their needs with some to spare and share - they helped feed the world. Now we worry. Land itself ""displaced"" and made unusable ... more than city folks might like to know. The grains they grew are modified into products that do not nourish. That is very scary.

Peoples who know how to live on the land are disappearing and the rest of us are consuming beyond our needs ... consuming these other folks (indirectly)and their habitats. Hungry city dogs.

Amdo Tibetan dialect film.

[PS  You can taste some really good meat in Tibet if you go soon. Yak sweeter than beef, but getting very expensive and supply spread thin. Better go to where they raise them naturally still before its over. Mutton and lamb nice, too.]

Watch it and write, too. Good film.

Less depressing, also quite real:

8592593,5,B00DELTUGM,"It is enhancing to one's own life to experience the lives of others most distant from our own. Thus, this tale of a dog's life (and value) as he is dragged about and sought after by his human overseers in theTibetan Himalayan hills gives us this new experience. Even the final moments adds a surprising insight. For the more thoughtful/philosophical viewers and/or dog lovers I suggest ""Le Quattro Volte"".",1378080000,2,405,4.884057971014493
