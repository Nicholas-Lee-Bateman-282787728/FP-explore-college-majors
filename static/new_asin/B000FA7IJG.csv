There are a couple of informative interviews with psychologists, but I honestly got more out of watching videos that were posted on YouTube.  I also purchased the ""Soar"" book that this DVD is featured with on Amazon's web site and found it to be more helpful than the DVD.  If you can afford the video, it might be a useful addition to other materials on fear of flying, but I wouldn't use it as your only source of information.",1439942400,,599,4.467889908256881

8119770,5,B000FA7IJG,"I have a panic/anxiety disorder which prevents me from doing many things. I had the opportunity to visit my mother in Alaska this summer and I almost didn't make it due to my irrational fears. I went through the online course and purchased the online video. Both helped tremendously! The video was informative and made me feel a lot better about flying. When I was on the plane I knew why it felt like we were sinking, what some noises were and most importantly the knowledge that the plane cannot fall out of the sky. I did use medication to supplement because the buildup was unbearable, but once on the plane I was calm and informed. I recommend the video and course to everyone who has any type of fear relating to the flying industry. Thank you Captain Chance for doing this!",1220054400,,780,4.5
8119771,4,B000FA7IJG,"I found this extremely helpful.  You can nit-pick the irrelevant factors, they use cartoons, the excerpts are dated but I sort of think they are going for a little retro flavor here.  Yes, it may be a little on the low budget side.  That being said, the key for me was all of the information that it provided.  It explained all about turbulence, a huge issue for me.  It explained just how thorough the airline industry really is, how everything is checked and double checked, how there are backup systems for everything.  They go over alot of factors, it's an hour and 45 mins long.  I would definitely recommend this for the fearful flyer. If you are looking for a viewing experience with award winning direction and oscar worthy performances, see Forrest Gump.  If you are looking for information based help with your fear of flying, buy this dvd.",1203638400,2,850,4.657718120805369
8119772,1,B000FA7IJG,"For forty hard earned dollars I was attempting to overcome a fear of flying I have had since a bad incident at the age of 9 so that I can now fly to visit my newly PA transplanted grandkids. What this ridiculous rip-off was majorly made up of was film clips of Arthur Godfry of the 1950's telling how a jet engine works, 1950's clips of old aircraft, passengers wearing little white gloves sipping tea from china on white linen tablecloths, cartoon drawings of planes with faces, and various ""therapist"" and ""stewardesses"" obviously, from the looks of their clothes and hairstyles, taped no later than the early 1980's and before, telling you most every malady that could take place in flight was very ""rare"" and if you just keep air blowing on your face and maybe take some sedatives, everything will be fine.  This was a waste of my time and money, did nothing to educate me, and lessened my faith in buying online  as well as Amazon for allowing such a poor product to be sold on its site.",1183766400,10,992,4.5055555555555555
8119773,5,B000FA7IJG,"You've may have heard the saying, ""Face your fear and do it anyway.""  That sounds great but how do you take that first step toward ""doing it anyway""?  This DVD is a fabulous tool for fearful flyers.  The Captain helps us understand why we're afraid, how it affects us and what is really going on with the plane, the people, the weather and other factors.  The basic principal is simple.  When we know what's going on, we no longer feel the fear.

The information is excellent and the participants are knowledgeable.  The details are presented by professionals who are working in aviation every day and you really get the feeling that they care about the struggles of fearful flyers.  The visuals really help you grasp the basics of flight and you'll be surprised how much confidence that gives you!",1144713600,2,798,4.690647482014389
8119774,5,B000FA7IJG,"Since I've had children I've developed a fear of flying, which no book or doctor has been able to successfully help me overcome. After watching Stacey Chance's video I now understand just how flying is actually safer than driving! He explains how the plane works (magnificently), security features both on the plane and on the ground, how easily both the plane and pilot can avoid severe weather, and most importantly for me, how turbulence is nothing to fear. He truly understands the panic of a fearful flyer, and calmly and competently talks us down!",1144627200,4,553,4.8936170212765955
