8523034,3,B00004YS6C,"KILLER NERD was a great film, and the sequel is okay.  A little less Toby in this film, which is probably its downfall.  Toby continues to fright and delight with his authentic portrayal of Harold Kunkel.  And, the film contains a great performance by a band called the Twist-Offs.  Whereas the original film had memorable scene after memorable scene, this film treads the line of being just another horror re-hash.  But, it is entertaining and worth the time to watch.  Just don't expect the greatness of the original.",1055894400,2,519,4.840909090909091
