8422211,4,B004BR1RKA,"As with Volume 1 & 3 this is the review of ""Muscle Cars"" that appeared on the Spike television show.  If you haven't any knowledge of these cars, then you are in for a treat, these are presented as they were in the time period.  If you are a die-hard addict of these cars you will probably find this to be fluff, however, you can show them to the great unwashed masses and not have to explain a thousand errors.
On a snowy cold winter night it's great to throw on one of these CDs, grab a few beers and wait for spring.",1402012800,,519,4.029126213592233
