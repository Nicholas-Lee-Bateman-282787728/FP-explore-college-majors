8697150,3,B00S2SYWHO,"This DVD features an hour-long (actually 55 minutes) episode of the PBS series ""Secrets of the Dead"".  Though Ben Franklin is in the title (and a photo of an actor who portrays Franklin is on the front cover) don't come here looking for much about the legendary American. This is really about a house that belonged to a friend in London where he stayed while on his long stays. He never owned it and was only one occupant of the house.

What IS covered here is how a group of scientists analyze a pile of bones discovered in the late 20th century in the basement of this house, when it was under restoration.  The house is called the Benjamin Franklin House because it is a tourist attraction and we hear from the curator. We also hear from a bunch of scientists both British and American. If you didn't know that this documentary was produced by WNET in New York, you'd swear it was a BBC production. (It is narrated by American actor Jay O. Sanders, who has narrated many of my favorite audio books over the years.

There are lots of ""reenactments"" in this show including the bone discovery about 20 years ago with actors playing the parts. There is also lots of creepy music to make it seen thrilling. It didn't thrill me. It was annoying. But I did learn things. And this is not a show you want to watch right after dinner or before bedtimes. There are some really graphic body part images. This is not a show for young children.

So, I can recommend this if you like things like CSI or anatomy. But don't expect to learn much about Kite-flying Ben here.

There are no special features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
