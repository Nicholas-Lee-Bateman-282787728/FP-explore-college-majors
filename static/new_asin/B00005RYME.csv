7952858,4,B00005RYME,"First off, for those who are wondering if this version is the same as ""Night Calls: The Movie 2,"" it is.  This is just a different edition of the same film.  The film starts with no particular plot in mind, just an introduction to the many attractive characters that make up the main story that starts about fifteen minutes in.  There are many steamy scenes with a wide variety of girls and situations, enough to fog up the screen with their heavy breathing time and again.  That alone would have been enough to garner this movie a 3-star rating.  What bumps it up a notch is the great mixture of looney-tunes style slap-stick with ""Benny Hill"" cinematography and some very humorous sound effects editing.  The main story is, on the whole, an X-rated version of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""  There is an inheritance to be had of 9 million dollars.  If the three participants and their friends can find all the clues and piece them together before sunset, with the frequent stop along the way to make love in some fashion or another, they will be filthy rich.  Instead of trying to find a big ""W"" they are trying to find the ""X"" where the loot is hidden.  There are plenty of blondish one-liners(like the title of this review) and hordes of double-entendres to be had through the course of the film.  The DVD is split into 12 chapters, though there are no extras to be had here other than a few outtakes spliced into the final credits Jackie Chan style.  This movie is a big wad of dumb fun filled with crazy situations and lots of playful acting from all concerned.  When I wasn't completely engrossed with the beautiful females I was laughing at all the absurdity and eventually I realized I simply had to recommend this movie.  Here's a quote to remember from the film:  ""Yippy...kye...yay!!!""  I won't ruin the scene by relating it here, but I actually had to pause the film I was laughing so hard.  All the women here are gorgeous, the dialogue is often very funny, and the cartoonish style in which it is made is very entertaining.  This is definitely worth picking up.",1094601600,10,2080,4.53083109919571
