7903115,3,B000003K60,"This late ST:TNG series entry has been the subject of much debate and the recepient of many negative comments.  I cannot side with those who judge this the worst of the TNG episodes.  It has many of the familiar series ingredients that makes it an engaging story, beginning with humor. Barclay obsesses needlessly about being infected with a deadly virus - Beverly informs him he simply has the flu, but only after mildly enjoying Barclay's discomfort.  Riker reports to Sick Bay as well, having accidentally rolled onto a cactus in the arboretum and getting it's needles stuck in his back.  Worf belches - loudly - during a meal with Deanna, ogles the waitress then Troi.  Riker suffers a loss of intelligence (trouble concentrating he says) that is undeniably humorous to see develop - especially the conversation with Geordi about whether to run a level 1 diagnostic.  When Picard and Data are in Sick Bay attempting to diagnose what happened to the crew they are interrupted by 'something' beating on the doors.  Data scans the area with his tricorder and reports, ""It is large.  It is approximately 240 kilograms.  It is heavily armored...""  Do you really need to hear anymore to know that you should arm yourself or get out of harm's way?
Besides that the mystery builds quite nicely allowing for both suspense and intrigue.  Worf becomes irriatiable on the bridge and is relieved of duties by Riker; later that night he scurry's about madly in his quarters destroying his bed and has fits of growling; Troi develops an overwhelming need to drink and later to be submerged in water; Barclays exhibits very odd behavior - even for him!  However, the episode takes an unfortunate turn halfway through from which it never recovers.
But, ultimately this episode has some story elements that are intellectually difficult to accept.  After Picard and Data encounter the Neanderthal Riker Data scans him with the tricorder.  He then reports to Picard that Riker's cranial bone structure has increased 20% and that his brain has decreased in size.  What happened to the discarded matter that once composed his brain?  After the crew is 'cured' by Data's toxin how does Riker's brain reconfigure to it's natural state?  Also,  both Worf and Barclay are depicted as having their skin replaced or discarded in favor of the new life form they are becoming.  How is their skin is repaired if it is missing completely?  Actually I suppose one could suggest that in the 24th century an advanced type of reconstructive surgery process could this.  Beverly did need it because of the facial damaged caused by Worf spraying her with venom.
Above and beyond all of these though is the theory that dormant genes within humans carry genetic sequences that could surface after an inexplicable event and effect such horrific changes.  It simply is unbelievable and insufficiently supported.  Some viewers were even offended or disturbed by the show's speculation of human's evolutionary development.  Keeping in mind that Star Trek is a show that historically takes adventurous risks (indeed, ""To boldly go where no one has gone before!"") for such an outlandish idea a stronger scientific platform should have been developed before progressing with the production of this story.  A more plausible development would have been that all the crewmembers regress to the same or near Neanderthal state that Riker does.
Still, I don't dislike ""Genesis"" for all it's flaws. Instead I like it because of the strong first half and also because it does dare take such a risk with storytelling.  I don't necessarily agree with the theories it presents but it does make for a lively discussion.",1037059200,,3664,4.985197368421052
7903116,3,B000003K60,"""Genesis"" is nowhere near as phenomenally stupid as the synopsis makes it sound.  The basic premise is, yes, pretty darned stupid, but if one suspends one's disbelief (and if one cannot do that, why is one watching Star Trek?), there are some fun chills here.
Gates McFadden didn't have much to work with, but she created a fine eerie atmosphere.  This one ends up being fun to watch (Troi scarfing down a big plate of caviar, Worf calvinistically suggesting it's too rich) -- and at least it's not preachy.",1002153600,4,507,4.685393258426966
7903117,5,B000003K60,....It's a television show designed to entertain. I loved this epsiode due to its suspense. The crew of the Enterprise slowly turns into different creatures due to a drug administered into Lt. Barclay. The thing that makes it exciting is that you don't know whats going to happen next and you don't know what everyone is going to turn into. Wipe the science of things out of your head and watch a classic such as this. .... 5 stars all the way.,992044800,4,444,4.426829268292683
7903118,2,B000003K60,"This is also my choice for the worst STNG episode ever.  Dr. Crusher is examining Spot, Data's pregnant cat, and Reg Barclay (Dwight Schultz) in Sick Bay.  She gives Barclay a synthetic T-cell that will allow his body to fight off this rare disease to which he is particularly susceptible.  Meanwhile, the Enterprise is testing a new targeting program for photon torpedoes.  One of them gets lost, which for some reason requires Picard and Data to get on a shuttle and go after it.  They return three days later and find the Enterprise crew has de-evolved into hideous creatures.  Every time some monstrosity shows up you get to guess who they really are.
I do not know a lot about genetic science, but this sounds pretty far-fetched to even me.  A synthetic T-cell becomes an airborne virus and every one starts mutating like crazy?  I don't think so.  Nor do I think that undoing such genetic mischief is equally easy to accomplish.  Certainly the make-up department does a nice job of turning the crew into various creatures.  Also, the romance between Worf and Troi continues: he bites her, but this also turns out not to be a good thing. But this is a poor use of Barclay's character and when all is said and done I am left with the conclusion ""Genesis"" is just a lame episode.",987984000,2,1282,4.60352422907489
