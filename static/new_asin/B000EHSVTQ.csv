Buddy & Bruno Sammartino,there were none better !!!!!!",1372636800,,278,4.470588235294118
8110036,5,B000EHSVTQ,"if you are a wrestling fan of old, this is a great 2 dvd set!  great matches, great quality, and tons of fun stuff!  i grew up watching awa wrestling in the midwest and seen killer kowalski, verne gagne (of course), the crusher, bruiser, and bobby heenan.  the gorgeous george matches are fantastic.  one can see where nature boy rick flair got his schtick.  but gorgeous george was clearly ahead of his time...  tons of matches on these 2 dvds:  midget women wrestling, tag team matches, a guy wrestling himself, and other fun extras.  i highly recommend this set if you like the olden days of wrestling and miss those saturday evening bouts.  a great idea would be to invite some friends over for some popcorn and saturday night matches!",1304035200,,739,4.623076923076923
8110037,4,B000EHSVTQ,"The Glory Days of Wrestling is an odd mixture of matches, movie shorts, and other oddities that wrestling offers from years gone by.  It's certainly fun to see how things were done 40 years ago, and this DVD collection has all kinds of stars from yesteryear (Haystacks Calhoun, Gorgeous George, Verne Gagne, etc...).  Plus, you really haven't lived until you see a 1970s midget woman's wrestling match.

Having said that, this is not going to appeal to everybody.  The matches themselves are all old school, and will probably not be enjoyed by modern day WWE/TNA fans (low production values, the women are not walking barbie dolls, and little high flying action).  However, if you are a die hard wrestling nut (or a person who remembers these guys fighting) - check it out.

By the way, I'm not sure what the one review was talking about when it describes a documentary - there is nothing like that on here.",1225929600,7,907,4.708860759493671
8110038,5,B000EHSVTQ,"Well-done video presentation.  If you are a wrestling fan from ""'way back,"" you will absolutely love this DVD, especially when it starts describing pro wrestling from the 1940's up to the present.",1175126400,9,196,5.125
