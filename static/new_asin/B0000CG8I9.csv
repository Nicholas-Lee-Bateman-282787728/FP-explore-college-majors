1919222,5,B0000CG8I9,"What an awesome DVD. The picture quality: excellent. The sound quality: excellent -- and be sure to turn up the bass for maximum enjoyment! I've been to (only) two Rev. Horton Heat concerts, and I thought this DVD successfully captures the fun and spirit of their live performances. (Of course, nothing compares to actually being in the crowd.) The set list menu allows you to flip around to your favorite songs. Extras include two entertaining and informative segments featuring interviews with Jim Heath, Jimbo Wallace, and Scott Churilla.
Many thanks to the band for making this DVD! Now I can watch this while waiting for them to come back to play NYC. :)",1074643200,,659,4.84070796460177
1919223,5,B0000CG8I9,"At last
The DVD all Rev. fans have been waiting for. If you have ever seen the band live you will know what I'm talking about. These guys rock live and this DVD captures it well. Good sound and great camera work make this a must have for any fan. This just solidifies the REV. as the greatest rockabilly band around.
A great stand out on this, is the drum solo on Big Red Rocket of Love(simply amazing !).",1072656000,,405,4.139240506329114
1919224,5,B0000CG8I9,"What a great DVD. Not too many rockabilly kind of DVD's looks this good. And nice to see that there is over 30 minuts of extra material on it. I can only say one thing, you gotta grap this hot piece, it's the best I've seen in a long time. Great band, great humor, and now on DVD......",1070496000,2,285,3.9310344827586206
1919225,5,B0000CG8I9,"I've attended more Horton Heat shows that I can count over the last 11 years, and this DVD really captures the crew in fine form.  If you've only seen them perform on tv shows, this disc far surpassess their appearances on Conan etc...  sound quality is great, and it still has a bootleg feel to it but with pro camera shots and superb audio.",1070409600,3,342,4.328125
1919226,5,B0000CG8I9,"This dvd rocks, cant say enough about Hortons guitar playing  and how cool the group is. Good video quality and the show plays right on through ,also there are group history stories added to view if and when you want. Great intro to Horton and some cool rock and roll, so buy it and enjoy.",1152662400,,289,4.254545454545455
1919227,2,B0000CG8I9,"I was sooooo excited when I saw this DVD in stores, but when I brought it home, I was disappointed. The quality isn't that great, the camera angles are boring, and it just didn't do The Reverend justice. The interviews were a mildly interesting, but basically, you should just get the ""Revival"" CD with the DVD in it. It's the same footage.",1129161600,5,340,4.5
1919228,5,B0000CG8I9,"IT'S THE REV!
LIVE!
IT ROCKS!
What's with all the whining about the technical quality and the set list?  I doubt you knit-pickers could ever be satisfied.  Maybe you didn't watch it loud enough?  I am grateful for the opportunity to have it.",1089676800,9,241,4.558139534883721
1919229,4,B0000CG8I9,"Even though the sound quality could have used some minor tweaking,(hence the lack of the 5th star) this DVD is fantastic! If your even mildly curious about the Heat, this would be a valuable dvd to add to your collection.",1087516800,,221,4.55
1919230,4,B0000CG8I9,"I really didn't see much of anything to complain about in this concert recording.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable.  Sound AND video.
The extras, where you get to know the Rev, and the band..... were well worth the time to watch.
This is a valued member of my entertainment collection.",1086739200,,285,4.68
1919231,4,B0000CG8I9,"First off, here is the set list:
Big Blue Car
Galaxy 500
Like A Rocket
The Party In Your Head
Big Sky
Baddest of the Bad
5.0 Ford
I Can't Surf
Wiggle Stick
400 Bucks
Loco Gringos Like A Party
Wildest Dreams
Marijuana
It's Martini Time
Jimbo Song
The Devil's Chasing Me
Psych-Billy Freakout
Big Red Rocket Of Love
Looks and sounds OK.  Video/DVD doesn't do the Rev justice.  Have to see it live.  The first 4 songs are off of the last 2 albums (Lucky 7 and Spend a Night in The Box).  Energy really doesn't pick up until Big Sky.  The last few times I've seen the Reverend, Bales of Cocaine was nowhere to be found.  Not sure if that song has been retired or what, but it is one of their better songs, and it isn't on the DVD.
Just by watching these guys perform, you can see that these guys actually work for a living... and they bust their a**es doing it.
The bonus stuff would probably be of interest to some of the more hardcore fans, but I don't think any newbies would get much out of it.
All in all, not a bad disc.  The things that make The Rev so good live (the crowd, the sweat and the smell of cheap beer) don't really carry over to the DVD.  So, if it has been a few months since The Good Reverend has been in your town, this DVD will keep you going until the next time they come around.",1084752000,9,1298,4.04296875
1919232,3,B0000CG8I9,"I love the good Reverend and was really dissapointed in this video. His shows are much much better. The good right Reverend got ripped off by whoever was doing the video and sound work. Unless they were relatives and did it for free. He should hire the people that did the Blasters ""Going Home"" Dvd.  If he has the extra bucks he should get whover does the DVD's for Brian Setzer. Anyway I will still come see you when you come my way, but this DVD is going to Ebay.",1083888000,2,466,4.177777777777778
1919233,5,B0000CG8I9,"This dvd has everything that is great about the good Reverend. Good times, great tunes and fantastic sound. I can't stress how good this dvd sounds on dts surround. There are two fun shorts with info on the beginings of the Rev. and the band that he is with today. If you are a fan of rock-a-billy you need to give this disc a spin. Crack a beer or four and praise Jimbo.",1082073600,,371,4.095890410958904
1919234,5,B0000CG8I9,good video. not as spontaneous as being at the show. worth owning,1075593600,,65,4.5
7999366,5,B0000CG8I9,This DVD rocks! Experience a great night in a club with a great band rockin' the joint. Just awesome rock and roll.,1494720000,,115,4.2727272727272725
7999367,5,B0000CG8I9,"Great DVD by Michael Drumm of Reverend Horton Heat concert in Deep Ellum, Dallas in 2002. This concert was performed following the release of ""Lucky 7"", RHH's seventh album. Great footage, well captured, and also some bonus footage of Jim Heath being interviewed and taking a stroll in Deep Ellum, where he started his performing career. Great video.",1431043200,,350,5.051724137931035
7999368,1,B0000CG8I9,"On 12.29, I'm waiting out in the Colorado cold to see if I could get Jim Heath's (The Reverend Horton Heat) signature on a poster. First, he said, ""Do you have a pen?"" I said I did, and pulled out a blue sharpie. He next said, ""Is it blue?"" I said it was. He proceeded to tell me he ""doesn't do blue pens,"" and boarded his luxury motorhome. Please do not support Jim Heath. Jimbo and Scott Churilla signed the poster with out hesitation. Jimbo even took the time to take a picture with us.",1393545600,,489,4.157894736842105
7999369,5,B0000CG8I9,"amazing show, seen in real, the drummer scott is an amazing musician with jazz feelin and big sound beating! jim heat is great as usual and jimbo too",1374624000,,149,4.357142857142857
7999370,5,B0000CG8I9,Nothing bad I could say about this dvd. Totally awesome. Watched it too many times to count in the last 2 months. The camera work is really like being there. Set the eq up and cranked it up. Get a copy and enjoy,1283644800,,211,3.9302325581395348
7999371,2,B0000CG8I9,"Just saw the Rev. last week at the Stone Pony. What a great show.
This DVD sucks. Like many of the other reviewers, the camera work sucks along with the sound. Pick up the Blasters DVD, you will enjoy.
Rev. u  owe us a better quality DVD. By the way, the cover of Paranoid was unbelievable.
The Truth.",1227571200,,301,4.189655172413793
7999372,5,B0000CG8I9,"Just went beyond my expectations!!! Perfect DVD with a very good quality on image and sound! And a very nice extra footage of Jim Heath showing the places where he began playing, and telling the history of the band!!!",1189036800,,217,4.589743589743589
7999373,5,B0000CG8I9,You really can't go wrong with the Rev... but this is a great recording of a great show.  Watch over and over... and over...,1180483200,,124,4.166666666666667
7999374,5,B0000CG8I9,"If you like Reverend Horton Heat, you will thoroughly enjoy this video of the band, live in concert.  If you aren't familiar with the band, the video is a great introduction, and will probably make you a fan.",1179705600,,208,4.473684210526316
7999375,4,B0000CG8I9,"Hey, I gave it 3.5 stars 'cause I've never seen it, but that seems to be the average. I was actually looking for a DVD with the Wiggle Stick video on it -- which was about the only good thing I ever saw on MTV. As I recall from seeing it years ago, it was shot at what looks like a torch-lit revival meeting with the Rev. preaching about the evils of temptation before he starts rocking out about his wicked little wiggle stick. Any tips most appreciated! Please e-mail me at bcsoup@aol.com if you know if it is available. Thanks!!",1152748800,,531,4.267326732673268
