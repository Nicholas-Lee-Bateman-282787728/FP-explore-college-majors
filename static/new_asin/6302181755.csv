If I can remember properly, this crud was produced and filmed in Japan  with American actors, and it was completed quickly to try to beat 2001 to  theatres.

434428,4,6302181755,"I've loved this silly flick since first seeing it on TV as a kid and so happy Warner has remastered it for blu-ray as part of their Archive Collection. It looks great and really does the colorful cinematography, FX and creatures justice. If you like cheesy fun flicks, read on...
Ten years before the campy fun of Message From Space, Kinji Fukasaku (who directed Battle Royale as well) directed this equally campy and equally fun 60s space opera about a space station overrun by tentacled alien creatures played by Japanese midgets in rubber suits. The film stars Robert Horton as hot shot Commander Rankin who is sent on a perilous mission to blow up a giant asteroid hurtling toward earth by landing on it and planting explosives. The mission is launched from space station Gamma 3 commanded by rival Commander Elliot (Richard Jaeckel) and the two butt heads over command issues and their mutual love interest, the sexy station doctor, Lisa (Luciana Paluzzi). But all that soap opera nonsense will have to wait as the asteroid is destroyed, but a sample of an organic tissue splashed onto one of the space suits makes its way back to Gamma 3 and soon grows into an army of one-eyed, green creatures with electrified tentacles. Can Rankin and Elliot put aside their differences and mutual lust for buxom space doll Lisa before these creatures overrun the station and kill everyone on board?

This colorful and fun B-movie as directed by the versatile Fukasaku was a co-production from MGM and Japans Toei Studios with a mainly Anglo cast, who take the silly proceedings dead serious and thats what makes this so much fun. The SPFX are delightfully cheesy as are the sets, the totally 60s sci-fi costumes and the hilariously campy dialogue. Its like watching a 60s rubber monster version of Aliens!  A fun and entertaining flick that is a really nostalgic good time if you can appreciate monster movies like this. Very 60s and a lot of fun.",1515801600,,1940,4.7880597014925375
434429,4,6302181755,"A very raw BR. The setup has no alternatives for sound, chapter or subtitles (only subtitle on/off).
Considering that the movie was made almost the same year of Kubrick's 2001 Odyssey, the movie looks very cheap and old. However, you must consider that it was a joint venture between MGM and TOEI (Japan), so, for the year, was the best that the Japanese movie industry can offer. It has the same feeling of the old Godzilla's movies with buildings made with cardboard and alot of sparkles and alcohol smoke. The effects are rudimentary and in this version you can see the wires in the monsters and astronauts. Although, I love it !!

SPOILER ALERT: a huge asteroid is in crash trajectory with earth and a mission is assembled to land in the asteroid, drill the surface and set a nuke to destroy the threat. Where you saw that before? (or later)
One of the astronaut bring to the big spaceship (in this case the space station) an Alien form that grows very fast and begin to kill people. Where you saw that before?

434449,4,6302181755,"This review is for the Blu-ray version of 'The Green Slime' released by Warner Brothers in 2017.

Anybody looking to purchase this movie should understand that this is a science fiction movie filmed in 1968 and the special effects are primitive by today's standards (2017).

I first saw this movie a few years ago in standard definition DVD format. I purchased this new release hoping for some extra's but I was disappointed. I was not disappointed with the picture but not overwhelmed either.

BLU-RAY: The picture is 1080p. The colors are vibrant, however the picture is not always as clear as one might hope. Don't get me wrong...it's a nice picture it just isn't perfect. You don't see many imperfections such as dust, hairs, lines, etc. The clarity varies depending on the scene. Overall i'd give the picture quality a 7/10.

EXTRA'S:  You don't get a whole lot. You get subtitles and you get a trailer and that's it.

PLOT/SUMMARY: At the open of the movie, we learn that an asteroid is heading directly toward earth and will destroy the planet if nothing is done about it. Commander Jack Rankin (Robert Horton) is just about to leave headquarters for retirement. General Thompson asks him to delay his retirement telling him he is the one man for the job of stopping this asteroid. Rankin agrees to take the job and leaves immediately for Gamma 3. Gamma 3 is run by a former friend of Rankin's by the name of Vince Elliott (Richard Jaeckel). We learn immediately that there is much animosity between the two. Apparently Elliott caused the death's of a group of people trying to save one person. Rankin does not think that Elliott is fit for command. In addition, Elliott has also stolen Rankin's girlfriend, Dr. Lisa Benson (Luciana Paluzzi). Rankin arrives at the base and agrees to a truce of sorts with Elliott. Rankin is given temporary command of the station but allows Elliott to come on the mission along with a Dr. Halversen and several others.
They arrive on the asteroid and the three teams place their explosive devices in the appropriate area's. Dr. Halversen notices a green slimy substance that appears to be alive. He takes a sample and puts it in a glass case. When he gets back to the ship, Rankin inexplicably smashed the sample and says they can't take it with them. Thanks to this idiotic behavior, part of the sample splatters onto Halversen's leg. The crew is told that the asteroid has accelerated (don't ask, just go with it) and they need to detonate the bomb much quicker. They just manage to get away in time and make it back to Gamma 3. The green slimy sample somehow changes into a one eyed creature. Even though they are on a base with weapons, the weapons are all energy based. This is a problem because the creatures absorb energy for food. Also when they bleed, their blood turns into more creatures. It's up to Commander Rankin and Commander Elliott to put aside their differences and come up with a way to stop the Green Slime!!!

PRODUCTION: This movie was a joint production between studios from the United States (MGM) and Japan (Toei). It was shot in Japan and used American actors. The film crew including the director, Kinji Fukasaku, were mostly Japanese.

This movie was supposed to be loosely connected to 4 science fiction films made by Italian filmmaker Antonio Margheriti in the mid 1960's. This movie used base Gamma 3 while the other movies used Gamma 1. Those 4 films were 'Wild, Wild Planet', 'War of the Planets', 'War Between the Planets' and 'Snow Devils'.

There is a 'catchy' theme song named after the movie. It doesn't seem to fit the atmosphere of the movie but nevertheless it is quite good.

The Japanese version of this movie was 13 minutes shorter. Most of the cuts are of Jack and Elliott arguing. This was probably a good idea!

THOUGHTS/COMMENTS: I felt the acting was mediocre at best. Robert Horton and Richard Jaeckel were decent enough but some of the others were decidedly below par.

I felt that the whole situation created in this movie was Commander Jack Rankin's fault. If not for his hardheadedness, the disaster would have
been avoided. He took a glass container with the slime and smashed it so it splattered and got onto the uniform of Dr. Halversen. Dr. Halversen
had explicit orders to go on the mission. He discovers life and handles it appropriately and bonehead Rankin smashes the sample. Of course this was normal for movies of that era. The military always wants to kill everything!
What wasn't done according to proper procedure was the decontamination scene. Dr. Lisa Benson, of all people, opens the door to the decontamination area before decontamination! Everybody acts as if this is no big deal.

I thought the miniature sets were excellent. I especially liked the base on planet earth. It seems like a lot of work for such a small amount of picture time. Everything was nicely detailed. Of course a lot of the miniatures looked exactly like....well, miniatures! I don't think there was much that could be done to improve that. Whenever the miniature vehicles were moving it was very obvious they were toy vehicles. But whatever...that's part of what gives these movies their charm.

I also liked the sets in general. The all had a decent amount of detail and none of them looked thrown together quickly. There was plenty of thought and effort given to the design of the sets.

I also thought the reverse thruster's on the rocket was a nice touch you don't often see in old sci-fi movies.

Dr. Lisa Benson's role was almost completely unnecessary. I guess she was there to have a damsel in distress and to add a love angle to the movie for the female portion of the audience. For the most part, the true issues between Rankin and Elliott had to due with decisions made while in command. The love triangle with Benson didn't change anything that happened or have any relevance to the events in the movie.

The scene in which the astronauts were supposedly fighting against 10 g's did not look good at all. Of course Commander Jack was still strong enough to fight off the 10 g's.

RECOMMENDATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: 'The Green Slime' is highly recommended for fans of 1960's science fiction. It is also highly recommended for fans of Japanese science fiction and movies that use miniature sets for special effects.

I'm giving this release 4 stars because it is a decent movie for it's type. I can't give it 5 stars because you don't get enough value for the price. At the time of this review, this Blu-ray cost $17.99.

This is not for millennials or for fans of CGI special effects! Unless of course you have acquired a taste for old science fiction movies.",1511222400,5,6651,4.722174288179465
434450,5,6302181755,"As a huge fan of Kaiju films Godzilla, Gamera and too many more to mention, I found a lot to like here. Best $18 I spent lately. Will enjoy this many more times. I forced my wife to watch it. In turn she let me know she didn't care for it. For the love of God why are woman so lame when it comes to movies? Yet she thought San Andreas was a theatrical masterpiece. I just don't get it...",1508457600,3,387,3.85
434451,4,6302181755,"BOTTOM LINE: Corny/creepy/cool creatures + Robert Horton, luscious Luciana Paluzzi & Richard Jaeckel = a seriously fun sci-fi throwback. Plays a lot like an old episode of classic Star Trek. And hey, its got its very own groovy Deep Purple-esque theme song, (which you'll be struggling to shake out of your suffering subconsciousness long after the film is over). Nice quality on this Blu-ray from Warner Archives. No bonus features beyond the theatrical trailer. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Space Station Gamma 3, in orbit high above the earth, is our first & last line of defense against... whatever. As the film opens, a rogue asteroid is discovered to have been knocked out of its standard orbit - and is now on a collision course with Earth! A small team of astro-science types are hastily dispatched from Gamma 3 to intercept and destroy the careening comet using high explosives. While manually deploying the bombs, a slimy life form on the asteroid hitches a ride back on the suit of one of the astronauts. Worse yet, after absorbing a high dose of energy from Gamma 3's electrical doohickey decontamination unit, the slithery substance soon spreads, multiplying into murderous waddling whatchamacallits who can shred flesh and electrocute with a single touch! The station is rapidly overrun by the shrilling sacks o' slime, and it'll take some hair-raising acts of selfless daring-do if anyone is going to survive to see the next sunrise.

THOUGHTS: Long a cherished guilty pleasure of mine, THE GREEN SLIME is super-silly 60's sci-fi nonsense at it groovy best. Stuffed shirt Robert Horton leads the cast, (apparently time sharing his hairdo with Jack Lord), playing emotionally disconnected a-hole officer Jack Rankin. Sexy red-headed Italian import Luciana Paluzzi, (best known as the wicked villainess Fiona in the 1965 James Bond spy flick THUNDERBALL), is essentially eye candy, as ""doctor"" Lisa Benson. Genre-hopping, favorite go-to 2nd banana Richard Jaeckel is the always grumbling Gamma 3 commander, Vince Elliott. Jack and Vince used to be bestest pals, until Vince did something pretty dumb and got a few folks killed under Jack's command. (Oops!) This mucho macho tension zooms off the charts when Jack's put in charge of Vince's space station until the crisis is over. There's also in an ugly romantic triangle with the two of them and Lisa, who can't seem to make up her mind. First & foremost though, the cranky commanders & their astro battalion must contend with the frighteningly fast-multiplying monstrosities, (essentially resembling big boogers with tentacles), which can replicate rapidly from just a single drop of blood. Thankfully, they aren't too fast; shuffling about the interconnected space station rather slowly, their irritating screams (which sound a lot like your finger does sliding back and forth across a wet dinner plate) echoing throughout Gamma 3's endless corridors incessantly. I'm guessing the in-English but shot-entirely-in-Japan production had a fairly lavish budget, judging by the numerous, fairly large sets, ""name"" international cast, and lotsa typical Nippon-style man-in-suit & miniatures-on-wires visual F/X on display. Honestly, if this innocent helping of harmless sci-fi fluff doesn't tickle your fancy then you may wanna check your pulse, 'cuz you're probably dead. :)~

THE BLU-RAY: A no-frills offering from the Archives division of Warner Bros., THE GREEN SLIME makes use of the higher resolution that Blu offers. The downside of this is that many of the optical tricks used to bring the  whole affair to life are exposed to even the most casual observer. If you can get past that then you're in for a treat, because the audio & video are quite splendid. Video is solid, with rich, vibrant colors that really pop, with no fading or bleeding. Blacks are solid and the mid-tones are likewise strong. Nothing in the way of artifacting or edge enhancement that I could see, but there is some crush/video noise throughout the film, which I suspect is the result of dialing up the sharpness for maximum picture clarity. Not a deal-breaker, by any means. >NOTE: aspect ratio is 2.35:1 (or thereabouts)< The audio is clean, clear & level, with none of the annoying hissing, pops, crackles and other such irritants which often plague older films like this one. Sadly, the only bonus feature is a copy of the film's theatrical trailer. Still, if you enjoy collecting older genre stuff like this, then I can honestly recommend picking up this nice Blu-ray remaster of THE GREEN SLIME.",1508371200,5,4554,5.158322056833559

it came out WAY before CGI was even imagined , so they had to rely on REAL special effect .

The Scope photography does wonders for this movie as it does for all of Kinji Fukusaku's other more serious Yakuza flicks.

The movie is as cheesy and out there as you remembered, a unofficial fifth movie in the Gamma 1 series of films that Walter Manley and Ivan Reiner produced before this with Italian Director Antonio Margheriti.

People often write in there own weird commentary of the Vietnam conflict, but it isn't really that I think. The writer I think just wrote a fun, cheesy space opera movie.

My only criticism of the movie is that the Future of 1968 is rather white, seriously not a African American in sight on any of these future sets. Never has the future been more white.

434674,4,6302181755,"Despite a limited product description by Amazon, and black & white photos on the back of the DVD case, ""Green Slime"" is thankfully in full-color so that one can fully appreciate the green, pulsing ooze that astronauts find as they land on an Earth bound asteroid.  Bright neon frothy green slime is apparently not enough to help the crew to notice they are accidentally taking it back onto their ship however, with predictably disastrous consequences.

Whether or not you'll like this movie will be obvious based on what you think of the DVD cover picture.  Knowing this is from 1969 and made by a Tokyo studio from that era (shot almost entirely with American actors in English however) will also help.  If you like those two things, you'll definitely get exactly what you are looking for here in this testosterone heavy space romp.  Excessive amounts of macho ego ooze almost as much as the slime, and creates several poor decisions by the almost all male cast who lead their space station towards disaster as they fight over who has the strongest jaw-line, stoic one liners, and best chances with a handful of retro-a-go-go nurses dancing at the onboard cocktail lounge.

While the majority of the movie is fairly straightforward 70's era science fiction action/special effects, their also exists a love triangle of sorts between male leads Robert Horton and Richard Jaeckel and ""Thunderball's/007"" Luciana Paluzzi (who for whatever reason has an accent that sounds like Lisa Douglas from Green Acres).

Either way, they brought much joy into my life.  I love this movie.  I knew I was in for a fun time when an asteroid that looked suspiciously like a flying meatball appeared on screen, destined to collide with Earth.  The name of this asteroid was Flora.  Naturally, the only thing to be done was blast it to smithereens.  They called for volunteers and before he knew it, Robert Horton (as Commander Jack Rankin) was conscripted to do the job.  The catch was, he had to also deal with an old friend/arch enemy (Richard Jaeckel) who stole his girl (or maybe she defected).  At any rate, a great deal of tension ensued, followed by some stony looks from all three.  Added hilarity came in the form of the kitschy look of the sets and costumes.  People were dressed in what looked like prison garb, police uniforms, or beautician smocks.  During the height of the crisis, some of the people in the control room were sipping tea.  I loved how they moved or looked in a single direction, synchronized.

Sure it lacks a menu and chapters, but these are just bells and whistles anyway.  As a plus, it doesn't force you to watch 10 minutes of trailers before you can start the movie like Disney's Fast Play.  It also doesn't have 5 hours of bonus features that you might never watch anyway.

Space Central calls-up their best man to lead a dangerous mission to blow it to smithereens.

His ship blasts off for space station Gamma-3, where he takes command of its asteroid interceptor.  It speeds to Flora, lands, its crew deploys, their wheeled vehicles splash through icky green puddles, the bombs are planted, the timers set, its time to go, but one man delays the takeoff to collect a sample of the pulsing, luminescent green crud; the commander knocks it out of his hand with a resulting smash and splash . . . .

Any other time, this would have been a stupendous discovery: the first encounter with an alien life; but, this is not the time to take samples, every second counts, they have got to get off Flora before they become part of its debris field . . . .

Once back at the station, the commander knows the potential danger that even a spec of alien life could represent to the human race; he orders the decontamination of the crew and their gear be run three times ... just in case.  No doubt, a sound decision, but before the toasting at the celebration is over, the first crew-member is toast; unfortunately, decontamination acted as an elixir the alien life needed to grow, mature, and multiply.

434754,2,6302181755,"The front of the DVD case is professional yet flashy and campy as would be expected of a movie from 1968.

On the reverse, a warning not in the product description immediately caught my attention: ""THIS DISC IS EXPECTED TO PLAY BACK IN DVD VIDEO ""PLAY ONLY"" DEVICES, AND MAY NOT PLAY BACK IN OTHER DVD DEVICES, INCLUDING RECORDERS AND PC DRIVES.""

So after shelling out $17 for a 43 year old movie, I may not even be able to watch it on my two $300 DVD-recorders or any of my three PC DVD players?  The only reason for this would be poor mastering.  Having purchased a movie I've been dying to see again since my childhood, I tried it on my PC first.  Yeah, it worked, but the over-produced UPOs kicked in and took over my player.  First the standard ""You're a future thief and a criminal"" warning flashed on the screen, giving me plenty of time to look at it.  Eventually it took me to the ""menu"".  No scene selection.  No subtitles.  No options.  Just press ""play"" to start.  The familiar scratchy intro with the MGM lion started and then it was off to the movie.  Twenty minutes later I had to remind myself that I was just previewing it to see if it worked.  I tried to jump ahead to see some of the monster action, but the UPO prevented this.  WHY?  Is there something criminal with jumping to a time index, therefore it's restricted?  At least the chapter skip option was available.

I kicked the DVD out and popped it into my DVD-recorder in the living room.  After waiting for the DVD to return control to me (again, WHY?), I tried again to jump to where I left off by the time count.  I was locked out of it.  I didn't remember the chapter (or have access to a chapter menu), so I had to experiment with chapter skipping until I found a close enough spot and then fast forwarded to the right segment.  Even my 1 minute skip forward and 15 second skip backward options were disabled.  Again, WHY, WHY, WHY?  Is there some law that when you BUY a DVD that you have to watch it in its entirety without touching the remote or stopping and restarting it?

This is a poor excuse for mastering, and as a consumer, inexcusable.  I get it.  ""Don't copy movies!""  But why prevent me from watching it the way I want to?  What does user control have to do with copying?

Once I got beyond the idea that I had no control over the movie I just bought, the movie itself was as enjoyable as I remembered when I was little, seeing it on a Saturday afternoon on Sci-Fi Theater.  The sound was even pretty good for ""stereo/mono"".

I would buy more of these on demand DVD-R formats ONLY if the studios get it in their heads that as a consumer, I don't want my DVD player taken over and my remote rendered useless.  Take off the UPOs.  I took 2 stars off just for that and another star for the high price.  This is a studio burned DVD, not a pressed master.",1313280000,6,2845,4.254205607476636

If you love 60's sci-fi B-movies (and know what to expect) you'll love The Green Slime!

The films comes via the Warner Bros. Archive and top marks to them for doing an excellent remaster job on the print.

The soundtrack is original mono.

The DVD itself is just the movie and a menu, no chapters markers or extras. It would have been great to drop the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 pilot on it or have some sort of affectionate retrospective.

predates 'Armageddon' as astronauts attempt to blow up
an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. They do so,
but end up contaminating their space station Gamma III
(an extremely low-budget plastic toy obviously inspired
by '2001', which was still popular at the time) with the
titular crud that spawns the space monsters. I wouldn't
be surprised if this, in some goofy way, also influenced
'Aliens'. The film was made in conjunction with Japan's
Toei studio and directed by their ace 'yakuza' director
Kinji Fukusaku, who recently found renewed fame with his
'Battle Royale' series of films. The quality of this disc
is miles ahead of its vhs counterpart (the only other one
in existence) and is widescreen - though there's no extras
and no chapter stops. I believe that's typical for Warner
Archive editions. You may want to wait for the price to
drop however.",1290643200,58,1212,4.748815165876778

Having grown up on this cheesy little slice of Jap/American filmaking I'm so happy I can put my crappy VHS away and finally see it on DVD. This movie has everything that a B movie lover could want !! Over the top acting ... cheesy monsters and one of the greatest instumentals songs of all time !! (Where Jack and Lisa are dancing and arguing over Vince. I can still play it on my synthesizer)Heck you can't even forget about the theme song that will having you swinging and singing till the dawn. lol
If you love the B-movies from the late 60's then this is honestly a movie for you. Imagine it... late Friday night ... home alone or with that special someone ... you just popped some corn and then you put your copy of ""The Green Slime"" in the DVD player.
It don't get much better than this folks.",1289088000,19,857,4.2
434825,4,6302181755,"""The Green Slime"" was a fun late 60s horror/sci-fi film about a bit of organic matter from an asteroid that grows into a seemingly limitless number of monsters which threaten everyone on a space station. It was the inspiration for the TSR (publishers of Dungeons and Dragons) game ""Awful Green Things from Outer Space"", which was first published in Dragon Magazine, and then released as its own boxed game.

Robert Horton, a staple of TV westerns and live TV in the 50s, is the handsome hero commanding the mission to the asteroid. Richard Jaeckel, a popular sidekick and character actor for decades, is the space station commander and leads the fight against the Green Slime. Luciana Paluzzi, Bond's beautiful female foil in Thunderball (famous scene where Bond confronts her in the bathtub ... she asks him to hand her something to slip on ... he holds out a pair of high heels) is the scientist trying to figure out how the slime creatures can be stopped in their tracks.

I give ""The Green Slime"" four stars as one of those movies you laugh at a lot, it would have been perfect Mystery Science Theater fodder. It looks to be scheduled for a DVD release, and I may well pick it up when it becomes available.",1288915200,5,1210,4.623255813953488
434826,5,6302181755,"Why this isn't out on DVD--even some cheapo non-remastered version--is a complete mystery. It's a hoot; a nice blending of Japanese and Italian sci-fi of that time. The monsters are goofy, but in a seriously disturbing way, and the film actually has a few weirdly nightmarish moments. I'd rank this in the top-twenty of hip gonzo 60s sci-fi.

A good pack of reviews for a film that doesn't exist any more. Maybe someone will notice and do something about it. But what somebody should really do though is get some of this stuff back on cable TV--movies like this were easy to find there in the 90s. Another generation could get hip to the fun of it and DVD sales might pick up.",1226361600,,676,4.495934959349594
434855,3,6302181755,"Most bad movies are simply bad, but now and then you encounter one that is ludicrously bad and therefore quite entertaining to watch.  THE GREEN SLIME, which used to be a favorite on the CBS late movie back when CBS actually had a late movie, is so relentlessly absurd that you'll giggle, grin, and occasionally drop your jaw throughout its entire ninety minute run time.

The story is pure sci-fi pap.  An asteroid is moving dangerously near earth and a crew is dispatched to blow it up.  They succeed--but they also pick up a tiny bit of green gunk in the process.  Once back on board the space station, the gunk grows into a bunch of rubber suits, each one looking like one of those 1970s rubber finger puppets only with a single red eye and tenacles that thrash around and eletrocute any one they touch.

This is in theory an ""international"" production, and it is true the cast is a mixed bag, but the production is pure Tokyo all the way, which means you get a lot models and a lot of rubber suits.  That in itself is rather fun, particularly re the rubber suits, which are so obviously what they are that it's impossible to suppress a giggle.  The fact that some, but not all, of the cast are obviously dubbed adds to the fun.

More amusing, however, is the ""swinging sixties"" atmosphere that pervades the film.  The movie opens with a guitar-heavy theme song that is pure 1960s psychedelia, and you'll go far to find another bit of music that is quite so cheesy.  Later, when the asteroid is destroyed, the crew decides to celebrate: the men jump into shiny leisure suits, the women break out shiny mini-dresses, and everybody sways around on a dance floor the space station just happens to have handy.  All the women are young and sexy and work as medical personnel, and everybody has dangerous hair.  For a time I wondered which was going to prove the most deadly: the rubber suits, the unnatural hair styles, or the leading man's excessively chisled chin, so sharp it might cut your throat if you got too close to it.

Now, the thing about ""so bad it's good"" movies is that they don't appeal to just anybody, so if your taste doesn't run to finding amusement in this sort of absurdity THE GREEN SLIME will be about as welcome to you as root canal.  But if you tend to laugh at Ed Wood, drive-in dreck, and such B movies as THE WASP WOMAN, this film's for you.  At present it is only available in the out of print VHS and in cheap-o DVD collections of equally bad films that mostly of the ""just plain bad"" variety, but for fans of the genre it's worth hunting down.

434858,3,6302181755,"When I watch MST3K, I'm always struck by how much I would rather be watching ANY of the movies it ridicules, than watching it ridicule them. There's nothing I find more pathetic than people (generally those incapable of creating any significant works of their own) sneering at the creations of others... often simply because those creations are perhaps not of the first rank in some technical way.

Green Slime, despite the jeers of the jaded, is really a decent movie on its own terms, that displays a courage that rises far above its obviously limited budget, and which deserves a far more respectful reception. Sure, this is ""merely"" space opera... but space opera gleefully reduced to the archetypal essentials: the square-jawed hero, the beautiful (but capable) heroine, the melodramatic conflict between former buddies... and, of course, the hideous (and, yes, rubbery) green monster to stir it all up.

Turn off your superior, hyper-critical faculties for a few minutes, and you'll find nothing here that isn't given great reverence in productions like Star Trek (especially TOS). Yes, the production values are on the ""cheesy"" side... but the film overcomes that trivial limitation by its sheer gusto. (Wonderfully exemplified by the effervescent title song.)

This is a movie that isn't afraid to do what it does, and it's enormously enjoyable because of that. Don't be fooled into missing the fun by those who simply don't get it, and would rather scoff at something they don't understand. I give it a well-earned 3 stars: a fine effort in a genre that clearly won't appeal to everyone.",1147305600,7,1596,5.06083650190114

434861,5,6302181755,"There isn't a single Japanese actor in this big-budget Japanese produced sci-fi drama, but the special effects are a dead give-away. A wandering astroid (code named `Flora') is on a collision course with Earth. Richard Jackel and Robert Horton lead a team which places atomic bombs on the astroid to blow it up. They succeed, but they unwittingly bring back an alien fungus to their wheel-shaped space station.
The fungus grows into man-sized monsters which multiply rapidly and overrun the space station. Jackel and Horton are forced to set aside their romantic rivalry over Luciana Paluzzi (`Thunderball') while they battle the creatures. Blazing laser guns abound in a desperate battle with the unstoppable monsters! The astronauts even don spacesuits and jet-packs for a battle on the space station's hull. All this in glorious color AND wide screen. Wow!
Sure, this sounds great but . . . well, these guys didn't know what they were doing.
 . . . Or did they?
`The Green Slime' looks more like a clever satire of sci-fi movies than an ineptly made film. The odds against all the side-splitting humor in this movie happening by accident must be astronomical. The potato-shaped monster suits are hysterical. The miniatures of the rockets are so tiny the camera can barely focus on them. The dialogue sounds like perfect parodies of sci-fi's most treasured clichs. (Example: The doctor rushes up to soldiers as their about to attack a slim monster. `Stop, don't kill it!' he pleads. `This is a magnificent discovery, and we must do everything possible to SAVE it!' -- and he says it in a perfect imitation of Richard Nixon.)
When the heroes' rocket tries to outrun an atomic blast, Robert Horton orders the pilot to increase thrust. But the G-forces are already so strong, the pilot can't lift his hand to reach the throttle. Macho Robert jumps up, walks to the pilot's chair, and pushes the throttle himself!
`The Green Slime' is so full of scenes like this that it should be re-released as `National Lampoon's Space Adventure'. And just wait until you hear the Jimmy Hendrix sound-alike title theme, a psychedelic rock tune. Its was even released on 45 rpm! (That's kinda like a CD, for those of you too young to remember.)
But this movie, call your friends, and mix up a batch of lime Jello as a snack. This is MST3K squared!",1071100800,32,2330,4.839598997493734
