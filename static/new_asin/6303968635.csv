752296,5,6303968635,"A departure from the complexity of Persona and The Passion of Anna, Bergman put together a highly accessible and clear portrait of the lives of a stereotypical ""successful"" suburban professional couple entering middle age and beyond.
Bergman is absolutely perfect in presenting the ebbs and flows of the relationship. The dialogue is amazing, and Ullman and Josephson couldn't have been better. Bibi Andersson's quasi-cameo sets the stage for the entire film, and the brutally acerbic dinner table scene is a classic of cinema.
A lot of people have been looking forward to the proposed sequel, but I'm not. Scenes from a Marriage couldn't have been better, and a sequel is likely to detract from one of Bergman's Top 3 movies in a long and illustrious career.",1060560000,7,759,5.031746031746032
752297,5,6303968635,"Ingmar Bergman to me is one of cinema's most powerful directors. And, ""Scenes From A Marriage"" is the most powerful, and haunting film I've ever seen about love and marriage.
 There's just something about Bergman's vision as a director and the camera of Sven Nykvist that brings this film to life. Bergman just throws these characters right into our faces, and we are truly mesmerize by them and their actions.
 For those who have never seen this film, it is basically just as it's title may suggest, a look into the life of one couple's marriage. Marianne (Liv Ullman) and Johan (Erland Josephson) are our couple in question. They have been married for a while now, and seem to have a good solid marriage. One wouldn't think anything was wrong, especially when compared to their friends like Katarina (Bibi Andersson) and Peter (Jan Malmsjo) a couple whom act like their about to kill each other at any given moment. The scene is involving them, is one of many sterling moments in this masterpiece.
 If I were to go on and talk about more scenes in this film, I would clearly be ruining the entire experience for you. Just rent this movie or even better buy this movie and be prepared to see the power that cinema can convey.
 ""Scenes From A Marriage"" is one of Bergman's best films. And, while yes, there is talk of a sequel, I can only hope, that it all remains a rumor. To make a sequel out of this masterpiece would surely be a mistake. Here's a film that is perfect as it is. Just leave it alone and don't add anything to it. Though, Bergman did make a sequel out of the Katarina and Peter characters and made ""From the Life of the Marionettes"", which does have it's powerful moments, but doesn't quite build up to what this film has become.
 For those who have never seen a Bergman film, I'd suggest watching ""Wild Strawberries"" first, then ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Cries & Whispers"" and then build yourself up to this one.
 Bottom-line: Truly one of Bergman's most powerful films. The single greatest film I've seen as of yet on the subject of marriage. This movie hits an intensity few have have ever achieved!",1032998400,13,2115,4.567282321899736
752298,5,6303968635,"'Scenes from a marriage' may seem like a bit of a chore: three hours relentlessly focused on two people falling apart.  And yet, it is one of Bergman's easiest films to watch, perhaps because it was made for TV, where there is rather more of a duty to hold a casual audience.  There are no deep metaphysical questions in the film, no long abstract conversations, little narrative trickery, just the everyday problems of recognisable people, perhaps slightly more articulate than the rest of us.
Bergman gives us a host of conventional reasons for the marriage's failure, but he has never been very interested in the naturalistic causes of anything.  In long, compelling takes, he gies us the process of marital drama; the experience, the taste, the gestures, irritations; the words expressed to fill up space, or words not thought through enough, yet taken as Holy Writ by the partner; the games, strategies, sarcasms, insults; the veneer of middle-class civility teetering on the brink of savage violence.
There is nothing as irreperable or final as a Hollywood film here, people feel one thing one minute, do another the next: they bear the scars but move on, there is no 'fixed' character.  People used to Hollywood practices of closure or plot inevitability may find this disturbing.
The characters played by Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann are rarely sympathetic, but they are more: difficult, sometimes devious, always vulnerable people forced to make hasty decisions that can change lives, or who bear the scars of routine for years before flaring out.  In other words, real, true - infinitely more important.",999734400,6,1617,5.06390977443609
752299,4,6303968635,"Ingmar Bergman's 1974 chamber-drama masterpiece was originally made as a six part mini-series for Swedish television--hence the divided tableau and emphasis on close-ups.  Of course Bergman is the greatest purveyor of the close-up, and here he uses it to accentuate the psychological torment and strain that a marriage propagates on its victims (after this movie you'll view marriage as a war, if you already don't).  Josephson and Ulmann shine as the dissenting couple, who first put up facades to deny the inevitable, eventually divorce, dive to relationship hell, and ultimately find a happy medium with a burgeoning love that could have never flourished if they stayed married.  Interestingly, Bergman chooses to never show the couple's children (that would simply add another tumult to an already tumultuous puzzle).  And, if it needs to be said, Sven Nykvist's photography is strikingly beautiful.  ""Scenes from a Marriage"" suffers slightly from too much dialogue and being a bit lengthy--the poignancy is nullified after 170 minutes of relationship vicissitudes--but deserves to be cherished by any fan of ""good"" cinema or of Ingmar Bergman.",998179200,,1148,5.426966292134831
752300,5,6303968635,"This begins slowly as a stage play might and continues as an ""interview"" seen on television and then suddenly springs like a trap and we are immersed in a compelling drama about people with longings and frustrations often felt but seldom expressed.  As Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and Johan (Erland Josephson) watch their friends expose the sordid details of their failed marriage, they are quietly smug that they are different; especially it is Marianne who is proper and conventional, always alert to the necessities of propriety, and is so happy that their marriage, while not perfect, will last.  And so it appears.
And then we have the scene in which Johan tells her that he is in love with a younger woman.  Her response is incredible tolerant and ""understanding.""  She is generous and sad instead of wildly jealous.  After a bit we see that this is a STRATEGY by Marianne.  She is desperately trying to save her marriage.  Even though she is faced with Johan's dull, almost absurdist indifference, she asks if she might help him pack his bags.  This is a woman at thirty-five, when everything that means anything to her is suddenly threatened, and this is how she responds, with genius.  Or, some might say, with madness.  Marianne's tolerance of his behavior is stunning while Johan's insufferable arrogance and ""worldly"" understanding of himself makes us want to scream. Will her strategy work?
What Bergman does that keeps us engrossed for the 170 minutes this film runs (edited from a six-part production made for Swedish TV) is he tells the truth.  It's a Bergman truth, but it is a truth so beyond the contrivances and superficialities of most movies that we are fascinated.  In this we experience the deep, unsentimental  fascination for people that Bergman is famous for.  In Liv Ullmann he found an actress (like his previous star protege, Bibi Andersson, who has a small part in this production), who could express that passion so that it could be felt by others.  In the cinema that I most admire there is an intense collaboration between director and actor that is expressed in the performance.  We see this in the work of Krzysztof Kieslowski and James Mangold and to a lesser extent in the work of Roman Polanski, Benot Jacquot and Andre Techine, who first directed Juliette Binoche.  But with Bergman there is a wider expression to include the experience of pathos and tragedy.  The revelation of the woman in the fullest extent of her being is what Bergman strives for, and therefore we find in Bergman the kind of psychology characteristic of Shakespeare or Ibsen, in which the characters are fully fleshed and expressive of a wide range of human experience.
I was pleased to see the photos of Liv Ullmann as a child and then as a little girl and then as a teen and then as a young woman worked into the film.  She is so beautiful and wholesome in a distinct way, like no other actress, and yet I knew her in the ninth grade in the person of a girl with the same red hair and the same pink, freckled skin--or so I imagine...",993772800,2,3043,4.718336483931947

752408,3,6303968635,"I have seen about 25 movies of Ingmar Bergman, and I used to consider this his best one.

After first watching 'Scenes from a marriage' (the theatrical version) I was very impressed by the acting, the intimacy, and the intensity and the range of emotions (both portrayed and evoked).
A second viewing more than a year later, made me feel that something was not completely right, it was just not it, and it left me pondering.

Though the movie and story feel (also) real and honest, there seems to be also something artificial which is not easy for me to put my finger on. Something seems to be missing that would give the movie a head and a tail; it does not feel round.
Bergman knows how to devote himself to a project, but in this case I sense something beneath his devotion that might be self-indulgence (with the subject).

[spoiler?]
There is a discontinuity in the character of Johan: in the 6th episode he is quite different from the first 5 episodes (7 years have passed, it could be a realistic change yet it feels artificial or unsound to me, convenient for the story).
Presumably it would be right to consider the relationship the real protagonist, instead of Johan and Marriane.

I would say that in this project Bergman lacked real artistic urgency (though he puts several artistic qualities into it), it seemed not an existential necessity for him to make it, as opposed to other admirable Bergman-movies, such as 'Winter light', 'Hour of the wolf' and 'Shame'.

I do recommend this movie because it can really be a special and intense and satisfying experience.
Yet, when people find this movie to be exuberantly pathetic I would agree with them.",1397692800,2,1661,4.694158075601375

752410,5,6303968635,"This is one of those great works of art that one should see at different stages of life.  As a youth, this appeared to me as the most depressing failure and dependency, though I seem to recall that I was thrilled by my reaction, that once again Bergman ""got to"" me.  Now, almost 30 years later, I see it in a completely different way:  from a busy facade of marriage, splitting up was not necessarily a failure, but one gateway to becoming very different, in many ways more mature, people, yet with the same core - and they still knew that spark of love.  Instead of depressing, I saw it as a beautiful kind of renewal, with all the negatives and suffering that comes from entering middle age.  Either way, it is an amazing film journey, with many possible interpretations.

This is my current perception.  Starting from a stiff and insipid interview, we see the 2 characters.  Johan is something of a narcissist, an over-achiever but burdened with insecurity and need.  Marianne is a maintainer of artifice, trying to keep them on track and refusing to see warning signs.  They live in a web of obligation and busyness, so choreographed by their parents that they are under-developed as people.  One of the most frightening scenes - the kind that make you remember childhood fears when your parents argued - is a horrible battle between married guests in their home, where their hatred for each other is scorching and irredeemably destructive.  The attempt by the hosts (Johan and Marianne)  to keep up appearances is as heroic as it is stifling.  Of course, it can't last.

Once they separate, they begin to learn about who they are, to the extent that they can introspect and see their own limitations.  Both of them go through stages of pain, selfishness, anger, frustration, and realization, switching roles as to who is the more sympathetic or errant.  All I can say is, it is a dazzling panorama of life, yet the production is extremely spare, only 2 people talking for the most part in a single setting.  I was once again astonished at the realism, the struggle, and the ambiguity of their redemption, if indeed there was one.  The ending image - of Marianne's nightmare - will forever be a touchstone in my memory.  Once again, this proves that Bergman was a great writer.

This is one of Bergman's greatest masterpieces, truly a must for all collectors.  I will continue to watch this periodically for the rest of my life.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.",1337644800,2,2475,4.717948717948718
752411,5,6303968635,"This contains both the original 6 part TV mini series, and the almost 100 minute shorter theatrical version.

In either guise, this is an amazing exploration of the decline and fall of a marriage, and the change, regressions and
growth of the two people in it. While a few other characters appear briefly, this is almost entirely a 2 actor piece, taking
place in small rooms, shot mostly in close ups.  Brutally honest about its characters' considerable shortcomings, it also
extends to them a generosity and grace.

The two central performances by Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson are uncompromising and uncompromised, completely
honest and truthful, as if we were eavesdropping on a real couple.  Astonishing work by both.

It's also an interesting portrait of a social moment - the early 70s - when women were finding their voice as equal partners
in marriage and society through the women's liberation movement. The piece feels dated, but only in an interesting way as
a look back, and yet seems to have paradoxically lost none of it's relevance. Styles and social customs may evolve, different
countries may deal with sex or affairs with somewhat different attitudes, but the desperately complex mix of needs, wants,
hurts, resentments and true love that make up a marriage seem to transcend time and place.

A very few moments feels forced or untrue, and another very few feel extraneous, but this is a remarkable film.

It also ushers in a new phase in Bergman's career, as the ever evolving artist moves into a kind of simple, naturalistic reality
that marked much of the work from this point on in his career. Gone are the heavy (if often tremendously effective) symbols
and surrealistic touches. This is life; raw, painful, rich and uncompromised.

I'm in the minority in that, for me the shortened feature version doesn't lose much in comparison to the 100 minute longer
TV mini-series it was edited from. While some interesting details that helped flesh out the story were gone, there is also a
laser like focus and heightened intensity that's been gained. For me it's a toss up. They're both great, landmark pieces of
film-making and acting, with slightly different strengths and weaknesses, but similar total effect.",1336521600,13,2229,4.989218328840971
752412,5,6303968635,"If you are an innocent who's never seen any of Ingmar Bergmann's later films, you should be warned that ""Scenes from a Marriage"" consists almost entirely of conversations between a husband and a wife. Early on, the conversations are perversely cheery and shallow; then there are confessions, stormy quarrels, accusations, apologies, fianlities that morph into reconciliations. In other words, it's ""all talk"" and if you hate movies that are ""all talk"", you'd be wise to avoid this one.
Here's an account of it, edited from wikipedia:
""Scenes from a Marriage is a 1973 Swedish TV series written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The story explores the disintegration of a marriage between Marianne, a lawyer, and Johan, a professor (played respectively by Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson), using just two principals, a  hyper-realistic cinematic style, claustrophobic close-ups and articulate monologues. After major success in Sweden, the series became notorious worldwide when it was condemned for allegedly inspiring a spike in Scandinavian divorce rates, which almost doubled in the year of its release."" The TV series was later trimmed and released as a single movie. This Criterion release includes both the four-episode TV series and the film version.

Notice that word ""articulate"" in the plot summary. Marianne and Johan are supremely articulate -- intelligent, educated, self-reflective beings rather than the run-of-the-mill ordinary clunks who populate most films. The genius of this script is that their articulateness remains plausible; assuming that they aren't always so pithy, we can still believe in them as viable humans. And they are both extremely interesting humans, with each of them realizing how totally they are interested in each other despite all the nasty quibbling and frustration. They're eventually worth the pain they cause each other, and thus they are worth the anguish we viewers will share with them as they claw and gouge at each other. The course of their 'divorce' becomes a kind of inversion of curves, as Marianne grows more self-possessed and astute about life while Johan dissolves from bullish self-proclamation to a kind or self-deprecating but kinder/gentler disillusionment with life. Johan is not ever a warm&cuddly fellow. He's a narcissist and a bit of a whiner. Does he really love anyone, first of all Marianne? He says yes and no with equal lack of conviction. Does Marianne really love anyone, particularly Johan? She certainly can't convince herself. And that's the story ....

But it's all about acting, dear readers. There's nothing to be said about this film except that the characters are compellingly ""real"", complex plausible fascinating human beings, one of whom could well be ""you"" and the other ""me"". ""Scenes From a Marriage"" could meaningfully be retitled ""Scenes From Our Marriages"". Bergmann rules! No one else has ever made films of such psychological intensity and insight.",1320192000,5,2941,5.347732181425486

It moves from the initial idyllic stage when a couple of professionals are building their home and family life up to the disenchantment with life in general and the fear of aging.  It depicts the traditional male mid-life crisis and the usual squabbles, but without the external drama.  The film focuses almost exclusively on the couple, which makes it much more intense.",1310860800,6,406,4.9411764705882355

752416,5,6303968635,"""Scenes from a marriage"" is a remarkable film about marriage and all its complications.  Most people think that no one knows what is really going on in the marriage but its participants.  What really happens when its participants are not honest with each other and go out of their way to deceive each other?  Such is the case between Johan and Marianne, married for 10 years with two daughters.  Both professionals from good families, they seem to be an example of a perfect couple until one day Johan announces to Marianne that he wants to leave the marriage and family.

Complicated emotions and relationships that follows 10 years after that event is what this film explores.  Who better to tell this story but Ingmar Bergman who seems to know human sould better than anyone and even in his personal life has gone through many marriages, divorces and complicated relationships with both his companions, friends and children.

Although this film was made long time ago, it is still relevant today.  Some of the observations presented in the film are compelling and I have found actors' performances in this film to be very convincing and at times hearbreaking with honesty and sincerity that is difficult to ignore.  Film classic that cannot be missed.",1284940800,2,1254,4.9052132701421804
752417,5,6303968635,"I'm going to divulge some very personal information here, but to anyone that is familiar with my reviews they will know that this is not unlike me.  I don't have a personal blog (although I really should) and since film, music and or the printed page touches me very deeply I feel obligated to let that ring true within my reviews.  I feel that if a film speaks to me then I have to explain why, for isn't that the whole reason to discuss film in the first place.  So, with that said; I have a question for you.

Have you ever sat with friends and witnessed the drunken desires to divorce and listened to their raging accusations and bitter disagreements?  Have you ever heard your best friend label his wife `despicable' or `soulless' or heard his wife label him a `liar' and `selfish' or `demanding'?

Sadly, I have, and I know I'm not the only one.

To be brutally honest in the past three years I have watched four of my closest friends go through divorce, and each time I (being the emotionally connective counterpart) wind up being the one to hear everything; providing the shoulder to cry on.  It's a tough job, and it takes it toll emotionally on a person.  I've cried myself to sleep on many occasions reliving the moments shared in such disarray with the people I care about the most, and it's not something I ever long to experience again.  In fact, I recently told my best friend that if he ever went through a divorce I think it would kill me.

I just don't think I could take it.

I recently sat down to watch Ingmar Bergman's highly acclaimed film `Scener ur ett Aktenskap' with very high expectations, but what I received is far more than I could have imagined.  This is a film so brutally honest that I was forced to turn it off no more than twenty minutes in because the verbal lashings proved to be too real for me to bear.  The situation (two couples talking civilly when one couple just starts laying into each other and expressing their very candid desires to divorce) was something I had found myself in, recently at that, and it just destroyed me, right there on my couch.  I was trembling terribly, so much so that my wife put the movie on pause and told me to get a hold of myself.  An hour or so later, after my wife had gone to bed, I sat down alone and finished the film.  The experience was surreal and devastating at times, one that I never want to repeat but will never forget.

The one and only film I can recall that had such an intense impact on me was the masterpiece known as `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile'.  Both films deal with two of the most painfully controversial subjects (this being divorce, the other being abortion) and both approach the subject from a completely neutral yet brutally honest angle.  While I don't know if I could handle watching either of them again, at least not anytime soon, both films stand apart as most probably the greatest films ever made.

Films are designed to reach an individual, and these two films tap into the deepest, darkest most unreachable places within our souls.

The film tells of the marriage of Johan and Marianne.  The opening of the film has the couple being interviewed for a magazine article, and this very scene marvelously shows the just how uncomfortable these two are with one another.  They act as if they are deeply in love, yet as they talk of themselves and how they met you can see, in their eyes alone, just how `fake' they know they are being.  The following scene (the one that forced me to take a break from the film) has Marianne and Johan discussing the article with their friends Katarina and Peter.  The drinks are flowing and before long Katarina and Peter are tearing each other apart; expressing their desires to be rid of one another, the whole time Johan and Marianne are crumbing inside.  This scene is the catalyst for the films depiction of Marianne and Johan's marriage, for it serves as an extreme case for them to avoid.  After their friends leave Marianne and Johan discuss reasons their friends loathe one another so much and try to convince themselves that their marriage is stronger than that; but as time progresses they find that they too are susceptible to the same wayward course.

Johan soon confesses that he has fallen in love with another woman and that he is leaving his wife and two daughters.  Marianne is understandably heartbroken, but her reaction is one of defeat not of anger.  She pleads and fights with Johan to stay, to give their marriage another try, but it is of no use.  He is done with trying.

The film follows their relationship through the years as they separate, divorce and eventually remarry (not each other), the whole time they remain as close as they can be, frequently visiting with one another to `talk'.  They are the closest of friends, even if they are no longer in love with one another.

For anyone who has seen the movie `Closer' with Jude Law and Julia Roberts I want to draw a certain comparison.  While this film is infinitely better made and acted, they are both rather blunt films.  The films entirety basically contains scene after scene of Johan and Marianne talking to one another, with only the first four scenes containing any other actors.  Within their conversations they bare their souls to one another, rather abruptly and bluntly, sparing no detail.  It can be uncomfortable, awkward and crushing to say the least, but it is so real, so raw and so honest.  Unlike `Closer', this film contains more that one standard emotion running through the actors.  These words, no matter how hurtful, feel so much more forgiving when considering the gamut of natural emotions flooding from the actors very expressions.

How Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson were denied Oscar nominations is beyond me.  The film itself was completely snubbed come Oscar time, despite the fact that it was hugely popular and garnered a lot of other awards attention.  Many rave this as Bergman's finest film, and I have to agree.  Despite the fact that I have not seen all of his films, it is hard for me to think of a film better than this one.

In my opinion the greatest films ever produced are the films that move us in ways we are not often moved.  They are the films so honest that they are hard to watch, because we see ourselves and those we love.  They don't necessarily have to pain us as this film does; it can call to mind the happiness that we've experienced in life.  The most important thing is that the film reaches a special part of us.  Bergman was able to paint a very real portrait of true love, one that fluctuates through real emotions; some hard to handle, others utterly redemptive.  There is a glimmer of hope that rests in the films final frames, a hope not of reconciliation but of contentment.

It'll be a while, if ever, that I am able to watch this masterpiece again, but until that day comes I know that its memory will haunt me.",1231286400,4,6910,4.522544283413849
752489,5,6303968635,"Leo Tolstoy once opined that all happy families are happy in but a few ways, while those that are not suffer in many unique ways. This apothegm was never more well evinced than in filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's five hour 1973 Swedish telefilm Scenes From A Marriage (Scener ur ett aktenskap), a miniseries that was even more influential in Europe than the American television miniseries Roots, which captivated American audiences only a few years later. Bergman's miniseries was repackaged for foreign markets into a 169 minute film version that, in 1974, was almost universally lauded by critics in America. Although, because it started out as a tv show, it was ineligible for Oscar consideration in America, it did win the National Society Of Film Critics Award for Best Picture, and, in 1977, PBS aired the entire uncut series. In many ways, it had more in common with such offerings as the U.K.'s Up Series documentaries, or PBS's An American Family, which chronicled the ups and downs of the real life Loud family. It was a film that also radically departed from many prior Bergmanian paradigms, even as it continued his in depth exploration of the interior human landscape.
  Gone was the poetic and dazzling cinematography of Sven Nykvist, as it was replaced by an even more obsessive look at the human mien, especially the gloriously radiant features of actress Liv Ullman's face. Ullman portrays Marianne, the female lead of the series, a thirty-five year old liberal leaning divorce lawyer who is married to a more culturally conservative forty-two year old professor and researcher at the Psychotechnology Institute, as well as a wannabe poet named Johan, played by Erland Josephson. We never learn the couple's surname, which only adds to their everycouple iconography, and the intimacy viewers feel with and for them. The couple's two daughters, Eva and Karin, make only a brief appearance at the start of both versions, although they are mentioned a few times more in the series. As the film version opens, the couple is being interviewed by a female writer (Anita Wall) for a woman's magazine, after ten years of marriage, and there are some awkward moments that belie the problems awaiting them just under the surface of their claims of being almost a too content couple. We are not sure whether this scene is the present- meaning 1973, or ten years earlier, for the series will progress over a decade. The tv version goes farther than the film version, and the first scene, or night's viewing, is titled Innocence And Panic. We see more hostility bared- overtly and covertly, and find out the interviewer is a passive/aggressive old schoolmate of Marianne's whom she is not too fond of.... ultimately, Scenes From A Marriage is a great work of art, and one that will still have relevance as long as human beings involve themselves in mating rituals. While it details a marriage, that marriage fails not because of the husband's midlife crisis, nor does it even fail because of the wife's first infidelity and over-compensatory smothering, but because the two characters were simply ill suited for one another- personally, emotionally, politically, sexually, and philosophically. No matter how well they knew each other, and we know that they know each other all too well, basic incompatibility cannot be overcome. Thus the greatest lesson the film teaches is not how to act during marriage, but to choose well before entering into it, because that is the single most important choice a would be spouse can make, and gives rise to the maxim that Tolstoy spouted. Were that not so Scenes From A Marriage would not be as engrossing, insightful, and relevant a work of art as it still is, as it would be like so many other marriages and films in the real world- thriving on the low hum of ignorance that its participants and viewers enjoy.",1221609600,3,3848,4.936728395061729
752490,5,6303968635,"At one point in Bergman's incredible ""Scenes from a Marriage,"" Johan tells his soon-to-be ex-wife Marianne that their marriage has failed in large part because both of them are ""emotional illiterates.""  We were born with silver spoons in our mouths, he says, and educated in the best schools.  But we weren't taught a thing about our souls.

""Scenes,"" one of Bergman's best films, is so intense that I find myself glad it's a series instead of a single piece.  I need the time between segments to catch my breath.  In it, Bergman uses the crumbling marriage of Johan and Marianne to invite the viewer to reflect on his or her own degree of emotional literacy.  How many of us, like Johan and Marianne, cling to a false peace rather than face very real tensions in our relationships?  How many of us confuse our own insecurities and hang-ups with blemishes in our partners?  How many of us, like Johan at the beginning of the film, are so arrogantly narcissistic that we take our partners for granted?  How many are like Marianne at the film's beginning, so insecure and desperate for approval, that we suborn our own identities to our partner's?

Like all Bergman films, there are incredibly bleak moments here.  But also like all Bergman films, there's a great deal of hope, although things certainly don't get wrapped up in a traditionally happy ending.  As we follow the film's protagonists, we see them both becoming transformed for the better, although the gestation has been bitter and sometimes brutal.  Johan becomes more fragile, more vulnerable, less arrogant.  Marianne becomes less mousey, less subordinate.  In the process, they grow better able to love one another.  Self-knowledge seems a necessary condition for emotional literacy.

An unforgettable film.  The Criterion edition provides both the full television version and the truncated theatrical one.  Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson put in stunning performances, so intense that one can only imagine how draining they must have been for the actors.  The only thing I can think of that's even remotely comparable to it is Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""--the play, not the horrible Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor film--or, better yet, Anna Karenina.",1216512000,2,2238,5.079452054794521
752491,5,6303968635,"The movie begins with a magazine interviewing a successful business couple, Johan and Marianne, and their two young girls appear for a minute.  And from this introduction, one can see the selfish Johan reflecting on the marriage as he seems self-absorbed with nothing warm to say about his wife of 10 years, Marianne.  It's indicative that the marriage is faltering.

Marianne and Johan are professionals, she an attorney, he a professor.  The viewer begins to dislike Johan; he's arrogant, disrespectful, distant father, and a real jerk for cheating on the lovely Marianne.  We don't see his lover, he just joins her in Paris.  On the other hand, we look at Marianne as weak and emotionally dependent on Johan.  But Marianne makes the transitions as a single person, while Johan remains wishy washy.

Bergman's movies involve close-up, intense dialogue, and subtle or very emotional drama.  There aren't a number or variety of locations.  Much takes place in the home.  There is a lot of dialogue which means we the viewer must receive the correct amount of translations.  It is said that with subtitles, viewers generally lose about 20 percent of translation.

This is a lengthy film, which was based on a television series.  Like any Bergman film, it is emotional and consuming.

752492,5,6303968635,"It's absolutely mind-blowing that only the hacked down 3h version was seen in the US before this box was released. I don't subscribe to the Bergman is an insane original genius school. Instead, I think that what is great about him is the fact that he is constantly trying new things, and this is a radical film. What's great is that it is so in many ways, and some of them almost sneaky. The breaks in time are the key here. The action recommences and the viewer is left to try and fill in both backward and forward in time. And as O'Neill said, when theater works, time disappears.

As radical as it is as a film, at the same time, it is, like everything else after it, a spawn of O'Neill's insanely brilliant ""Long Day's Journey Into Night."" From this perspective, it, like everything else, must wither, at least partially. LDJIN has a philosophical density that Scenes does not achieve. At the same time, though, the sheer genius of LDJIN is that the cycle of ascribing blame never sets, and each turn is followed by some undoing. Actually, Scenes achieves this in a way that is totally disarming and powerful, making for a shattering ending.

Great, totally engrossing experience. (If you like this, get Sidney Lumet's 1962 version of Long Days Journey.)",1196121600,8,1258,4.63677130044843
752493,5,6303968635,"Like Beethoven in his piano sonatas, the genius of Bergman builds an extremely impressive whole out of many small and seemingly simple elements.

At the surface level, the film is about a marriage between Marianne and Johan (played superbly by Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson).  At a deeper level, the film is an honest insight into the human condition, with all its complexities (physical and metaphysical) including despair, joy, self-deception, self-obsession, cruelty, etc.  Bergman's understanding of the human condition is on a par with that of the German-Swiss novelist Hermann Hesse.

The director relies primarily on the rich dialogs between the two main characters, as well as the intimate, emotion-capturing close-ups, to develop and convey his story.  Scandinavian minimalist simplicity that pervades this film is an excellent choice, as it allows us to focus on the substance.  The master cinematographer Sven Nykvist, as one would expect, did not disappoint us.

Bergman takes his time to fully develop the two main characters.  This comes at a ""cost"" in terms of the length of this film.  I am more than happy to bear that cost.  All great masters know that it simply takes time to develop a character.  This is true for films, novels, or even operas (Mozart and his use of operatic arias comes to mind).

This film reminds us that no one is perfect and no marriage is perfect either.  A marriage can fail even when the two people give their best, let alone when they don't.  We are also reminded that freeing ourselves from the imperfections of a marriage, our own personal imperfections and shortcoming will not, of course, just disappear.  To be married (or not) becomes almost immaterial.  Most of the time, we are, in essence, alone in this world (even when surrounded with other people, including family members).

I personally prefer the 5-hour TV version.  I cannot find a single reason why I would want to deprive myself of the two hours that were cut from the theatrical version.",1195257600,2,2005,4.9879518072289155
752494,5,6303968635,"This has got to be one of the most realistic, honest, truthful and incisive studies of human relationships ever commited to film. Ingmar Bergman really makes his case here that all you need for a movie are skilled actors and an interesting script. This has got to be one of the best screenplays ever. The level of depth, complexity and nuance to these characters is astonishing, and the performances of Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson more than match the script. Liv Ullmann in particular, is an acting God, and this is instantly one of my favorite female performances ever. The characters just feel so real and complete, and many times during the film I related so much to their trials and tribulations, to their anguish, their fears, their confusion and longing that sometimes I felt like I saw a big part of myself in these characters. It's that personal and that real. The level of intimacy and minimalism achieved by Bergman and DP Sven Nykvist is awe-inspiring. The 5 hours flew by so quickly that when it was over, I was bummed because I would've been more than eager to spend another 5 hours with these characters.

Just an amazing, incredibly understanding, moving and perceptive masterpiece.",1188864000,6,1202,4.834951456310679
752495,5,6303968635,"Scenes from a Marriage is a film about a breakup.  We are not talking about some ephemeral youthful relationship, but a happy marriage of many years between a couple who truly feel they are happy together.

Yet cracks become visible, and soon the whole structure comes tumbling down as the once happy couple spends the next 15 years of their lives trying to make sense of it all.  The film (aired in Sweden as a 6 part miniseries) is 5 hours of the most intense, painful, emotional conversations ever committed to celluloid.  It is filmed almost entirely in close-up with sparse lighting and no music.  I have watched it multiple times and by the end of the emotionally grueling experience it feels as though you have lived through each moment Johan and Marianne have experienced, no matter how far from your actual life any one detail might be.

That may not seem like the most pleasant viewing experience, but I should add that the film is not quite as harrowing as my description might make it seem.  Yes, intense doesn't even begin to describe it, but Bergman has created the film with such honesty that there is no manipulation or unnecessary suffering.  Even the immortal Eric Rohmer has never displayed this level of understanding into basic human relationships.  Again, there is no manipulation here; Bergman would never stoop so low as to include suffering merely for the sake of additional drama.  What is actually present in every second of the film is simply many lifetimes worth of wisdom on love, loss and moving on.

There are no easy answers in Scenes from a Marriage.  The film is an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.  The person who is handling things the best will just as often have hit a new low when they are revisited down the road.  The couple's bond will never disappear and yet they can never be what they were to each other.  Old feelings resurface, old wounds reopen, old passions return and throughout it all Sven Nykvist's camera does not flinch.  No film has done more with such a stark palate of images.

What elevates the film to ""second favorite movie ever"" level for me is not just the insight into human interaction, though that is my favorite subject matter in film.  Scenes from a Marriage is not content to merely show what the loss of a loved one is like, Bergman also has a point beyond a simple documentation of the dissolution of a marriage.

By the final chapter, perfectly titled ""In the Middle of the Night in a Dark House Somewhere in the World"", an epiphany is reached.  Johan and Marianne do not necessarily ""get back together"" or ""never see each other again"", but a certain level of acceptance is reached.  That which can never be understood, which no one can put into words, and which has no solution is somehow grasped in the final scenes of this magnificent movie.  Like a fleeting glimpse of the sun from inside a cave, all the mysteries of life and love briefly make sense.

While I never leave a viewing of Scenes from a Marriage feeling any less confused about the grand questions of life, I can't help but suspect that for a time during its brief 5 hours I almost had it.  What more could any artist want from their viewer?",1185926400,6,3193,4.610619469026549
752496,5,6303968635,"Bergman's ambitious, profound chronicle of love, selfishness, regret and missed connections that often characterize matrimony, and indeed, male-female relations. Long and demanding, but richly rewarding, the film's impact lies less in its portrayal of a subtly stagnating union than in the nuanced nature of the couple's interactions after the marriage is over. An Ingmar peak. Stay with this-it's worth it.",1183507200,,407,5.8
752497,5,6303968635,"I used to think that I knew a thing or two about marriage having been married for as long as I have but nothing from my experience had prepared me for the merciless and deep dissection of Marriage: Bergman Style. When we meet Johan and Marianne for the first time, they have been happily (or so it seems) married for ten years. They have two daughters; they are still young, very attractive, healthy, educated, well off, and they seem to love each other very much. But Bergman is not interested in happy families - all happy families are happy in the similar ways. Like Tolstoy many years before him, Bergman explores the second part of the formula - All unhappy families are unhappy in their unique ways.

Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship.

There are actually four marriages Bergman studies in ""Scenes from a Marriage"" -none of them is happy, all are miserable. Bergman does not deny the possibility of finding a soul mate but his opinion on the modern marriage is quite pessimistic.

It felt like Bergman was saying - marriage is dead, long live love. For hours after the film was over, I could not shake off the sadness and pessimism of it. Only later I realized that even if four marriages in Bergman's film were disastrous, it does not necessarily mean that all couples in the world are or have to be that miserable. Bergman wrote and directed Scenes from a Marriage in 1973 when he was in his 5-th marriage, the one that would last for 24 years until his wife died. He brought in the screenplay (I think so but I may be wrong) the bitterness, resentment, anger and disappointments from his previous four marriages - maybe that's why the film is sometimes almost impossible to watch?

""Scenes from a Marriage"" is a masterpiece but it may leave you devastated and emotionally exhausted. I watched the original 5-hours TV version and did not even bother with three hours version.

752498,5,6303968635,"This is a masterwork.  Bergman managed, somehow, to top himself yet again with this extraordinary miniseries.  It is a brutally honest, painful, funny (yes, funny), and depressing portrayal of a marriage disintegrating, getting back together, truly disintegrating, and finally, near the end, coming to somewhat of a reconciliation, even though it's more of a realisation than anything.  It's not a tidy little wrapup you're used to in American TV/film.  It is simply the story of a marriage between Johann and Marianne.  There are many highlights, such as the dialogue in which Johann goes off on women and feminism in episode two.  It is hilarious and quite truthful.  But the best episode is episode five, when Johann and Mrianne finally sign the divorce papers.  Marianne is much more assertive and independent, and Johann is meek and bitter.  Marianne lashes into him with every emotion she can muster.  Johann eventually breaks out into a pity party, then gets physically violent.  Johann was the one who left Marianne for another woman in episode three, leaving Marianne devastated.  It turns out that Johann's affair didn't turn out as he expected, and he's turned out to be the meeker of the two, and he doesn't like it.  This is such a contrast to the feel good, phony advice that TV gurus, sitcoms, and countless ""how to figure out men and women"" authors dish out in this country.  Relationships are extraordinarily complex things, and here Bergman dives into it like no other filmmaker has.  Only Catherine Breillat comes close to the real issues that exist between the sexes as Bergman does here.  I, like many others, initially saw only the theatrical version (and it was dubbed in English as well).  I also saw it when I was around 19 or 20, so I didn't really get it.  I watched it because it was ""intellectual"", I guess.  But seeing it now, and having open my eyes to the world a little wider, I really appreciate it.  Thanks to Criterion, I've seen the miniseries version, and it is far superior (like Bergman's Fanny and Alexander) to the cut version.  And it plays better on a television, with the full framing intact (the theatrical version is matted).  The penetrating closeups of faces really make this extraordinarily intimate telefilm/film/miniseries.  You must see the entire series, as opposed to the edited film (while good, it still doesn't get at the heart of the series).  If you really want to figure out men and women (or come as close as you probably ever will), see this miniseries.  You still won't help you figure out men and women in a permanent sense, but it will help you understand things a bit better.

752618,5,6303968635,"I watched this film in two sittings, in part because of the length (2:48) but also because of the sheer density and weight of the material onscreen.  Like all Bergman films this one takes you deep into the psyche of its main characters with a mix of intensity and realism AND surrealism that is absolutely breathtaking, original and refreshingly unpredictable.

One of Bergman's trademarks is his slow camera that lingers over closeups of the actors' faces, as if thrusting their naked, twisted and unknowable emotions straight into our own faces.  There is an element of ruthlessness but also of compassion in this type of camera work.  So many times during the movie I found myself thinking, ""Now this is where most directors would pull back for a full body or medium or long-distance shot rather than stay in uncomfortable and intrusive closeup range.  The aesthetic here is both spare and unsparing...unlike most of today's movies it does not have any musical score at all to lean on, instead Bergman relies on the depth of his characters and the skill of his camera and cast to keep the viewer riveted.

A true masterwork from a true master!  This is one film definitely worth owning, like a good novel it has many many layers and nuances and undefinable moments that you can go back to again and again and notice new things each time.

752619,5,6303968635,"From its uncompromising script, through Sven Nykvist's deft camerawork to the flawless honesty of its acting, this film delivers one of the transcendent emotional experiences in world cinema.  Its themes of personal and sexual liberation, as well as the emerging feminist perspective of its heroine, give it a definite period feel (early 1970s), but its concerns are timeless.  In one great scene after another, Bergman lays bare our basic human conundrum: the need to be separate and autonomous wars with our need to be connected.

The opening scene is an interview with Johan (Erland Josephson) and his wife, Marianne (Liv Ullman) about their marriage.  Self-satisfied Johan preens as he describes how perfect they are as a couple.  Marianne, deferential, beams with quiet pride at his side.  Despite their warm words, their bodies seem oddly out of rythym with each other, a clue to further cracks we soon see in the couple's smooth faade.  She's not as devoted to their sex life as he is, and both of them resent the tyrannical sway of her parents.  We watch Marianne try to tell her mother that they won't be coming as usual for Sunday dinner, and then quickly back off when her mother objects.

Johan is a closet poet.  When he shares some poems with an old college friend, she tells him not to bother sending them to a publisher.  In a quietly devastating aside, she tells him that back in their university days, their entire circle thought that Johann would advance much further than the rest of them.  The implication is, of course, that he hasn't.  Stalled in mid-career as a researcher, and chafed by the demands of domesticity, Johan undergoes a classic midlife crisis.  He comes home from work one night and tells Marianne that he's fallen in love with a twenty-four year old colleague.  He's leaving the marriage and moving to Paris with her.  The rest of the movie traces the emotional contours of their separation, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliations.

The abandoned Marianne slowly frees herself from the hold Johan and a conventional marriage had on her.  That freer person soon discovers her sensual side, and over time becomes the person Johann would actually rather be with.  But it's too late; she's moved beyond him.  In a scene as believable as it is wrenching, they meet in Johan's office to sign their divorce papers.  They both need answers for why they failed at something to which they gave the best of themselves.  And by now, Johan understands that freeing himself from Marianne didn't free him from his own limitations.  His frustration and disappointment boil over into brandy-fueled violence.

The sad truth this movie reveals is that people can love each other without understanding each other, or they can understand each other without loving each other in the ways that they need to be loved.  Bergman seems to be saying that nothing in the institution of marriage alters these facts.  In the end, Johan and Marianne, both married to other people, still make room for the bond between them, a bond too deep to not acknowledge, but not deep enough to keep them from forsaking all others.  They're not reconciled, exactly, but they've achieved the peace that comes from ceasing to struggle.  As they hold each other through a long night, they look, and we feel, somehow hopeful.  Bergman's great achievement is to make Johan and Marianne stand in for all of us, who are selfish and insecure, but heroic in our efforts to achieve any little clarity before the lights go dim.",1116028800,38,3514,4.87858347386172
752620,5,6303968635,"Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.

What makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel, act, and generally take care of issues.

This isn't one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them.

In here, as he is telling his wife about this other lover, she is without emotions, just staring off, with no real reactions whatsoever, a way most would respond.

This is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great/perfect. It is later that she finds outs that perhaps, the marriage isn't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce.

There, the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage. He later says he's been with a woman for a while now, and shortly there after, leaves her.

After a year of so, they get together to sign the divorce papers, which turns out rough at the end.

After some time, they get together again, and in some way, fall in love once again, even though both are married to other people.

752622,5,6303968635,"This DVD set includes both versions of Ingmar Bergman's minimalist epic SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE; the 3 hours cut for theatrical release, and the original 6 episodes (Mr. Bergman calls them ""scenes"") over 5 hours-TV series, in a beautifully restored High-Def master.

The film was shot in 16mm which is grainier than a 35mm film, and this High-Def transfer even represents the peculiar material textuality of the grain structure of a photographic film stock. Some DVD aficionados might object to this un-digital look, but that actually makes the film more soft, warm, and human. It actually looks better than 35mm release prints of the 3 hours version.

I first started to watch the TV series around midnight, thinking maybe I will watch just the first episode and go to bed, and would continue to watch one episode every night. What happened? I kept watching until 5 in the morning, and was so excited I didn't feel like going to bed so also watched the supplements. The next evening I watched the 3 hours theatrical cut, finishing it with a burning desire of going back to the TV series.

With the consistent strength of his works, as well as his high reputation lasting for the last fifty years, it is hard to realize that Ingmar Bergman is actually a very flexible filmmaker, whose career is marked with constant transformations of style and subject matter. But comparing his greatest films such as SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, MONIKA, THE SEVENTH SEAL, THE SILENCE, PERSONA, CRIES AND WHISPERS, AUTUMN SONATA and FANNY AND ALEXANDER, one should be surprised with the wide variety of his dramatic body of works which is constantly renewing itself.

SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE is a radical film.

With Drier's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and Roberto Rossellini's VOYAGE IN ITALY, it is probably the most radically purest adventure in film history: What is the essence of cinema after all? These films seems to be saying, ""it's the actors and their faces"".

There are several key films among Bergman's works that mark drastic transformations of the filmmaker, and SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE probably represents the most important one. It is also, while being the most popular work in his career (legends say that during its original TV broadcast, the streets were deserted in Scandinavian cities), it is also the most radical example of Bergman's creative challenges as well as the purest example of his fundamental attitude towards filmmaking: his abstinent concentration in observing how human emotions express themselves. The most important element in a Berman film is always the actors; their body and especially their faces.

In most parts you only see the two actors: Erland Josephson and Liv Ulman. Because it was a very low budget project originally made for television, there's nothing spectacular or photogenic in the modest production design which is kept in a minimalist simplicity. It was modestly shot in 16mm 1:1.33 aspect ratio, with a deliberately muted color palette. These are ordinary people living surrounded with un-extraordinary interiors and wearing every-day clothes, like most of us.

The story that spans over ten years has no apparent plot point except maybe Johan the husband (Josephson) confessing to Marianne (Ulman) that he was having an affair: still a banal one comparing to most ex-marital affairs in movies that usually develops into fits of jalousie, murder, and so on. Marianne simply becomes devastated, as most wives probably would do. The most ""dramatic"" thing she does is...screaming on the phone.

But that minimalistic modesty doesn't prevent SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE from being extremely intriguing, exciting, sometimes funny, and keeping the audience's emotion and interest always closely hooked. The simple visual design opens the door to appreciate the subtle yet profound emotional human expressions that we probably won't realize if it were in a superficially dramatic settings. You just cannot stop watching it, being constantly amazed with the wide variety of faces Ulman and Josephson transforms themselves into, and gripped with the depth of feelings that they express through that.

This film has an almost hypnotic effect. From the first episode you start living with Johan and Marianne.

Perhaps if you are a man you'd start identifying with Johan and his suffocating feelings after 10 years of seemingly happy marriage with his seemingly perfect wife--as I did myself. Then you will be surprised at, after the divorce, the transformation of Marianne becoming more and more alive and attractive. At certain point you'll feel miserable with him. If you were a woman you'll start seeing their story from Marianne's point of view.

But the film itself never takes side. If the audience will see it from Johan's point of view, they will eventually have to recognize his failures and defaults and limitations. If the audience will see it identifying themselves to Marianne, they will have to see how stuck she is, trapped in her own ideas.

Nevertheless, it is not a depressing pessimistic film like Berman's pre 1970's films. Once you truly accept that nobody is perfect, the last episode will reveal that this minimalistic epic of a married life is actually Bergman's celebration on relationship, and that mysterious feeling we call love.

Just a warning: I have to confess that when I first saw SCENES OF A MARRIAGE as a teenager, with only very few experience in life and especially in relationships compared to now... well, I was totally bored, didn't get the film at all. There are nudities in the film but none of them were about sex.  Johan and Marianne were not attractive at all and seemed to me just stupid. So some films requires the maturity of the audience's part to be really appreciated. Don't judge Bergman if you are still under 28! Buy this DVD but save it until you'd feel you are getting matured.

In 2004, Mr. Bergman went back to the couple Johan and Marianne, after 30 years of their separation: SARABAND. Now they have grand children. I hope this long-waited return of Bergman to filmmaking will also be soon availabe on DVD.",1106092800,99,6088,5.012871287128712

752624,5,6303968635,"This film is incredible. It is, however, a brutal one to watch (the intense arguments are too intense to watch at times, there is so much PAIN in this film). Its basic plot, as ridiculous as this sounds, is ""husband and wife argue, then make up, then argue, then make up, then argue, then make up, and so on and so forth"" or ""husband and wife love eachother, then hate eachother, then love eachother, then hate eachother, then love eachother, etc."" Yet in this back and forth plot, progress is made all the time. A couple who seemed SO perfect in the film's famous and brilliantly forboding opening interview sequence, begin to realize that they cannot go through life being a perfect married couple and still love eachother in the process. The incredibly well rounded characters we know at the beginning of the film, Johan and Marianne, are NOT the same characters we know at the end. The incredibly cocky and self-assured (""it would be too much to say that im bright, handsome, and sexy"") Johan becomes the incredibly weak and humble Johan as the the film progresses, while the woman Marianne, who believed that she was put on this earth to be a good wife and mother, nothing more, becomes the confident Marianne, who realizes it is not at all a sin to have your own personality. In essence, the film chronicles the immense change of two people as they become farther from eachother.
Basically, the point of the film, in my view anyway, is to show that Marianne and Johan love eachother SO MUCH that marriage only restricts this love. They get along BEAUTIFULLY (they really do, unlike while they were married, when they just SAID that they get along tremendously) in the last Scene, when they are finally divorced and remarried to different people. Bergman's point surely was to show that marriage can be a bad idea. Two people who love eachother a great deal just do not work well together when married. Love becomes second to the other obligations that come with marriage. Too much time is spent discussing finance, the children, work, and looking like the happy married couple than time spent actually loving one another. Indeed Bergman laugably blamed the film for an increase in divorce rates. It seems wrong, but he may well be right. Marriage is bad for love.
There were some things I enjoyed a great deal about the film. Firstly, the dialogue. It was brilliant, as one would expect from Bergman. Witty, clever, and powerful words (the film is based around conversations) prevail. Secondly, much has been said of Sven Nykvist's camera work, and I must agree it is wonderful. His camera captures so much emotion from the actors, he often keeps his camera fixed on Liv Ullman's face as she, for example, hears of her husband's infidelity. reaction is more important in Scenes from a Marriage than action is. Thirdly, the ACTING was nothing short of astonishing. Bergman regular Liv Ullman's performance is the performance of a lifetime. There is a scene where she is in bed with her husband, who had just told her about his desire to leave her for another woman, Paula. As he says ""I've always hated you, for several years, I've HATED you"", Ullman's reaction is INTENSE. It's as if every word he says is like a knife that sticks in her side. It's a thing that comes on all too suddenly, a man who she thought loved her sits there saying it was a lie all along. She carries the performance beautifully. Erland Josephson is also VERY good in an obviously more difficult role. He plays a man who loses his self confidence, and he plays it well. Lastly, I loved Bergman's use of forshadowing. On your initial viewing, Johan's addmitance about Paula comes off as extremely shocking, however, if you go back, everything really forshadows the end of their marriage. We know something's up from the very beginning. There is this sense of tension and uncomfortableness, its as if, at times, they don't even love one another, they are just playing the parts of the perfect husband and wife.
This is my favorite Bergman film of those which I have seen thusfar (others are Persona, Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, Cries and Whispers, Hour of the Wolf, Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, and the Silence.) It is a very realistic approach to the concept of marriage, and shows the fact that married life is not all as good as it seems.
This film will leave you breathless, if not lifeless. I recommend the SERIES rather than the film, there is even more intensity, and more characters and character developement. Arguments become intense. ONE WORD, and i am not joking, can strike your heart like a sword, just as it does to the characters in the film. It's always that one last thing someone said that they shouldn't have. It is INTENSE.
I cannot reccomend this DVD enough! BANG UP JOB CRITERION!!!!!!!!! I love the inclusion of Both the series and the film, particularly the series, and the extras, though small in numbers, are GREAT in quality. The three interviews included arre very informative, and i could ask for nothing more. The insert booklet is very nice and very attractive, as is the entire package. The entire package, down to the menus, was very nicely designed. the menus are animated and fit the mood of the film very well. The image, though it could not be helped (it was shot for television), is kind of bad, So.........
FILM: 10 STARS/ 10 STARS

One of the greatest films of ALL TIME, certainly one of my favorites, and one of Criterion's best releases hands down. BRILLIANT FILIM!!!!!!",1080864000,24,5531,4.714876033057851
752625,5,6303968635,"This Criterion edition is an absolute must-have for any fan of Ingmar Bergman's work. I have seen the 3-hour film version several times before, and felt it was superb, as most of Bergman's films are, but it faded for me in comparison with my favorites, ""Persona"", ""Cries and Whispers"", ""The Silence"", ""Shame"" and ""Through a Glass Darkly"". The 5-hour TV version, however, presented here for the first time in the US, is a revelation to me. It is startlingly contemporary. It is like seeing the film fresh, for the first time. I am struck by the naturalness of the acting of Bjornstrand and Ullman, giving astonishing performances, both in terms of nuance and intensity. At times, one forgets that they are acting, they so inhabit their gruelling roles. Liv Ullman is particularly great here, and photographed with luminous intensity by Nykvist, the master cinematographer. This is a woman who has her world shattered, and who responds to her changed circumstances in realistic stages: denial, anger, grief, rage, and finally acceptance. Also, I am struck by the way this particular film is the unacknowledged ""grandfather"" of independent contemporary film technique. A recent article in the New York Times on Dogme astonished me by the failure to even acknowledge Bergman's influence. Liv Ullman is spot-on in the interview when she notes that ""Scenes from a Marriage"" was Dogme filmaking 30 years ahead of Dogme, and that the often hand-held camera here moves with precision, versus the shallow, self-indulgent scattershot mess that is so tedious in the films of the Dogme filmmakers. In the five-hour TV version, one sees the film as it truly is, a groundbreaking, thoroughly engrossing masterpiece. Finally, it reminds us of how little we ask from our own TV movies in the US. This is a riveting, compelling, lacerating work, made with compassion and with a strong humanist understanding. Bergman didn't come to this spareness and austerity out some philisophical point of view, like Dogme has with its ""manifesto"". Instead, ""Scenes from a Marriage"" arrives at its technique out of Bergman's desire to get as close as he can with his camera to the faces, emotions, and flawed humanity of his characters. It was a process he began with ""Persona"" and which opens further in ""The Passion"", and which here is expanded out and relentlessly focused, like a pure, blue, Scandanavian flame.",1079827200,18,2384,5.068702290076335
752626,5,6303968635,"What a treat for the DVD world! This DVD include teh original 5-hour presentaion of Scenes from a Marriage and the original US version AND an interview with Ingmar Bergman! And it is worth every penny.
Some might say that the film is too long. However, you must possess patience when watching one of Ingamr Bergman's films for he uses what is commonly unknown in the world of cinema today: pace. He makes time for the develpoment of his characters, he ensures that we see the changes that they go through, but what makes him a master of his craft is his ability to make his films viable and interesting every step of the way. The same is true for Scenes from a Marriage. He shows the disintergration of a marriage and the consequences it has on these two people. His characters are fragile and courageous, reasonable and irrational, but most importantly, they are human. Scenes from a Marraige is a great example of Ingmar Bergman's skill at work.",1078185600,5,947,4.609467455621302

7858381,4,6303968635,"Considered a masterpiece by most critics, I had never seen this cut of the film.  It was originally a 6 episode (297 minutes) mini-series.  Aside from an opening scene of a dinner at Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and Johans (Erland Josephson) home, the film is about the marriage and all of its warts between the two professionals living in Sweden.  The dinner scene also features one-time paramour of the director Ingmar Bergman, Bibi Andersson as Katarina.  She is married to Peter (Jan Malmsjo).  The booze is flowing freely and the good friends begin to talk about marriage.  Peter and Katarina devolve into a bitter and very ugly argument which looks like divorce is on the way.

After they leave, Marianne and Johan discuss an interview they had given earlier for a magazine or newspaper.  Essentially, they have slightly different views on the condition of their own marriage.  While they both agree their marriage is agreeable, it lacks passion and emotion.  Again, for Johan this translates into a lack of sexual activity.  Marianne declares she doesnt like having sex.  Eventually we learn it isn't that she isn't a sexual being, she just wants a more intimate involvement, not just the act.

Marianne, a lawyer and Johan, a college professor have been married 10 years at this point.  They have 2 daughters, who we never see and both sets of parents who they have dinner with each week (also off screen).  One day, Johan comes home early and declares hes fallen in love with a 23 year old graduate student.  They plan to leave the next day for Paris where she will conclude her studies.  Johan has taken a sabbatical from his teaching position.  While most events like this would not go well, Marianne proceeds in a very business-like fashion, hoping that Johan will eventually come back to her.  Most will find this position a little off-putting.

From here on this will be Mariannes movie.  How she copes with the situation.  After a couple years Johan does return and what would seem like negotiations begin, including a still unsigned divorce agreement.  More time passes and each is married again, but agree to see each other.  Alas, the love for each other remains compelling if still out of reach.  Liv Ullman, is beautiful to look at and to watch.  Her characterization of the conflicted woman is perfect.  Bergman made a good choice, and like Ms. Andersson, Ullman had fallen under the spell of her director, providing him with yet another child in 1966.

So is this a great movie?  Well not quite.  I will admit the culture and the fast moving subtitles may be my problem.  There are essentially only 2 characters in the story.  The movie is shot entirely indoors and consists of fast moving Swedish dialog.  Im a pretty fast reader but it is hard to keep up with the dialog and the expressions and mannerisms of the characters in the equally fast movie edits.  Bergman manages to elicit the many undercurrents of marital love with equal parts disappointment and downright bitterness.  It is well-presented but is a lot to take in.",1472688000,2,3045,4.790384615384616
