47525,5,0783115539,"George Smiley (Denholm Elliott plays him so unassuming and gentle) and Ailsa Brimley (Glenda Jackson is a joy!) play former spy chums who crack a murder case in Carne, a classic English Boys School environment.

The school is all that is desirable on the outside, yet has dark secrets on the inside. Sheila Rode possesses all these secrets and is murdered for them.

What I find most intriguing about the story is how people remember Sheila. She is a Goody Two Shoes that everyone loved to hate. Even her father cannot say anything good about her, even when pressed by Smiley in his reporter's guise (Smiley: ""How would you best remember her?"" Father: ""She got what she deserved."") Ouch. Her last act of blackmail was against her husband in a letter written to an agony columnist. In talking to Smiley (it turns into therapy for his agonized mourning--this is an especially good portrayal of complicated loss) the husband reveals he hadn't realized how much he'd hated her--how evil she really was--until after her death.

No clue wasted in this John Le Carre screenplay based on his book by the same name. I loved the cinematography. Those haunting images of the ghostly figure in the luminous raincoat on the bicycle traveling through the rain--what the homeless woman saw, of course, when she thought she saw the devil. Maybe she did.

I was looking for something more similar to P.D.

As I'm not familiar with most of the actors aside from Bale, Denholm Elliott (whom I love in the Indiana Jones movies!), and Glenda Jackson, I was a little confused as to who the characters were and their roles in the school's heirarchy.

47538,3,0783115539,"I have to confess that I'm not that taken with this adaptation of John Le Carre's second novel. Perhaps it's because Le Carre himself wrote the screenplay. Though I can recognize him as the creator of some very compelling characters and exquisitely rarified literature, I do often have problems with the transparency of his plotting -- even though much of his fiction is in the thriller/espionage vein. I read the novel itself years ago and liked it, though the mechanics of the ending put me off a bit. In this dramatization, I find myself sometimes at sea: characters don't seem properly introduced, the significance of certain elements is murky to the very end, and some clues or aspects don't receive the emphasis I think they should.

The performances are all first-rate, and the sense of period is extremely well-crafted. I will admit that I'm not all that entranced by Denholm Elliott's portrayal of Smiley -- not because of comparison to Alec Guinness, but because I find Elliott's creation presents a too-befuddled impression on the rest of the world, though inwardly he clearly knows his stuff. But that's a minor criticism compared to my dislike of the screenplay, which I consider too opaque.",1449964800,,1204,4.96039603960396

47547,5,0783115539,"Don't know how I ever missed this film: I read the book only months before, am a huge le Carre fan, have seen most of the films made from his books -- if not, now, all -- including the six-part BBC Tinker, Tailor innumerable times.

In fact, Joss Ackland, in a still-memorable bit, played Jerry Westerby to Alec Guinness's George Smiley in that BBC production. Here he plays Terence Fielding to Denholm Eliot's George Smiley. Safe to say, I think: he's the only actor to share scenes w both George Smileys.

And speaking of making the most out of bit parts in films of the seventies: this film also features Ronald Pickup, who played the forger in the great Fred Zinnemann thriller Day of the Jackal; one of those roles that establishes a career (obviously). The forger made the mistake of trying to extort extra money from Jackal Edward Fox, which became the last mistake he ever made. Another great bit performance in that film was by Cyril Cusack, as the gunmaker. He didn't try to double-cross the Jackal, was paid in full, and lived to tell about it.

Back to Murder: It's a very good film. Denholm Eliot does a fine turn as Smiley, much different from Guinness's but entirely credible. Glenda Jackson and Billy Whitelaw are as usual excellent. It boasts a screenplay by le Carre himself, there are many interesting lines dropped in conversation, and it has a very early appearance by Christian Bale, as a dodgy schoolboy. Elizabeth Hurley got an early break as a public schoolgirl in an episode of Morse, Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts and maybe even Thandie Newton played schoolgirls in Flirting, Australian I think. Nice film.

UPDATE: I have since seen this film maybe four times and must say: I never thought I'd find a better-acted, better-cast film than the BBC's six-part Tinker, Tailor, but think this film might be it. Every single part is perfectly cast, perfectly acted. Stanley Rode, Inspector Rigby, the Hechts, even the young professor who grades the paper. Even the young woman who helps track down the clothing donation in London ... every one pitch perfect. As for the writing, I don't believe there's a wasted line. I saw entire bits the fifth viewing that I somehow missed the previous four, don't ask me how.

Now: having seen the film so many times, I did catch a fairly large/insignificant flaw in the script, depending on your perspective, which is: when were those  papers graded?",1409616000,,2409,4.751196172248804

47549,4,0783115539,"This is a fairly slight outing for the great Spy Master, George Smiley. On an unexplained hiatus from the circus (British Secret Service) Smiley (here played by a very unassuming and perceptive Denholm Elliot) is talked into investigating a mystery at the Carne (as in meat perhaps?) school. It seems that a one-time colleague from the Circus Ailisa Brimley  - beautifully played by Glenda Jackson wants to use his connection with the brother of a now dead spy. So the point is, the Old Boy network works. This contact is Terence Fielding (played as a cynical aging gay male Joss Ackland) a soon to retire, without pension schoolmaster at Cane.
Smiley arrives at Carne to find that the game is afoot. The person he is sent to check on was the wife of a very junior temporary school master. Was, as in she has been brutally murdered. Again Circus connections insure that the local constabulary is welcoming to this outsider. Smiley proves himself a worthy consulting detective.

This is not a heavy or philosophical John Le Carre project. One might think that the author was beginning to realize that he needed more than just the great game of international espionage as a topic and by using his star character he could insure sales. Smiley is clearly the master of this case from the beginning. For all twists and almost incidentally disclosed clues - why for example was the victim so openly hated by the closed community of the Carne School? We get the initial impression she is a meek religious woman. There is no point in the movie where the viewer can doubt that Smiley will break the case.

A Murder of Quality is a: who done it?-procedural kind of mystery.  We are given a fair chance to get ahead of Smiley, as we learn things sometimes, before he does. For example we know why Mad Janie thinks the murderer had ""silver wings"" because we saw them even before we knew who was to be the victim. By playing fair with the viewer, I give Le Carre credit for building a reasonably complex plot and not making the solution some last minute thing only the detective could know. In fact I think one of the most important clues comes very late in the movie, but is missed by Smiley.

Bottom line is that A Murder of Quality is not a great movie. It is a fair afternoon, family relaxing time event. There is nothing very deep or crude. There is little or nothing to offend the ear or eye. Mostly there are lots of polite people going about their lives, while mostly ignoring the nasty business of that murder. Get your popcorn, relax and rest assured that the local investigating Inspector will be suitably respectful when he finally gets to take in the person `what done it"".",1403568000,4,2673,4.59538784067086

47561,5,0783115539,"Not too short, not too long. It's a really well written story that was easily transferred from a short novel to a script for cinema by John LeCarre. Denholm Elliott didn't put on the powerful performance of Alec Guiness in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy but it just wasn't needed in A Murder of Quality. Denholm Elliott put on a fine performance along with fine performances by Joss Auckland, and Glenda Jackson. It's also more of a mystery than a tale of espionage and intrigue. So a different sort of George Smiley was needed in this tale who worked well with the other characters. Joss Auckland plays Mr. Fielding, a killer. Glenda Jackson is a colleague of Smiley, Ms. Brimley, who just can't accept the outcome of an inquiry into a woman's death and drags Smiley into the matter. Along with a local police office, Inspector Rigby played by Matthew Surfield, George Smiley's investigation gradually causes Auckland to panic and kill a young student under his care who might have implicated him. The murder only confirms their suspicions and leads to a superb final scene between Denholm Elliot, Glenda Jackson and Joss Auckland at a dinner for three when they reveal their conclusions of their investigation to him while Digby waits at the door for the arrest of Auckland at the end of the dinner. A good deal of the cast possessed experience in the English theatre and worked in this A&E television production. It's not an action fim so much as a who-dun-it? A truly classic one. It's also rather undervalued like Chimes at Midnight, Beat The Devil or The Legacy of Albert Schweitzer. They often drop out of sight and re-discovering them can be quite fun.",1331164800,,1657,4.7770034843205575
47562,4,0783115539,"First, I recommend C. O. DeRiemer's plot summary (currently the lead review on the Amazon site).  It offers nice details (with some spoilers) to flesh out the basic story: George Smiley is called out of retirement by a wartime colleague to investigate a letter from a woman at a very British public school in Dorset.  The woman believes that her life is in danger and that her husband may kill her.  Smiley investigates (meekly and mildly, but devastatingly effectively) and is later aided in the case by his friend, Alisa.  The latter is played by Glenda Jackson, Smiley by Denholm Elliott.  Along with a series of British character actors, Jackson and Elliott are joined in this story by Joss Ackland and a teenage Christian Bale.

In some ways the story is quite traditional--violence in an academic setting that is replete with gossip, backbiting, sexual misbehavior (both gay and straight) and fine claret.  The difference is that few such crimes are solved by the likes of George Smiley.  Elliott is superb in the role--pitch perfect I would say--and so are Glenda Jackson and Joss Ackland in support.  Matthew Scurfield, playing the local detective inspector (chain smoking but always bumming cigarettes) is also excellent, complete with wry lines, a bad haircut and untied coat belt.  Bale seems awkward in the role of a schoolboy with shaky grades.

The writing is excellent and it's a pity that many American viewers will have difficulty following it.  The dialogue is replete with British idiomatic expressions, the sound levels fluctuate and the direction is very choppy, as if certain scenes were left out or have been edited in slightly improper order.  Crank up the volume; you may wish to view the film twice to catch all of the details.  It is worth doing so for the writing and for the individual performances.",1324598400,2,1828,4.931372549019608

47568,4,0783115539,"Denholme Elliot does an understated but solid turn as John Le Carre's quintessential master spy George Smiley in this excellent made-for-TV version of ""A Murder of Quality.""

George Smiley is asked by a wartime colleague to visit the wife of a teacher at Carne, an exclusive English Prep School.  The wife, who does not fit into the existing social set, fears for her life.  By the time Smiley arrives, she has been murdered.  The balance of the movie is Smiley's patient unpeeling of the complicated and most uncivilized lives of the faculity and students of Carne.  In the end, and with the assistance of an often baffled local police chief, Smiley cleverly unmasks the killer.

Denholme Elliot lacks the world-weary qualities and understated ruthlessness of Alec Guiness's later portrayal of George Smiley; this is George Smiley at an earlier, less cynical, and more sociable stage of his career in espionage. Elliot is surrounded by a very solid cast that include Academy Award-winner Glenda Jackson and veteran British actor Joss Ackland.  A young Christian Bale (Batman Begins) features as one of the students.  Le Carre's novel was hard to follow in the original; this film version will challenge viewers to pay close attention to the storyline.

7790124,5,0783115539,"I can no longer recall if this is the first of the Smiley character novels by John Le Carre' or whether it is ""Call for the Dead"".  Doesn't matter, both are great stories that get foreshadowed by the even greater story of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, and the even greater production of the story by Sir Alec Guinness as Smiley in the PBS series of Tinker Tailor.  Nevertheless, this is still a great story and well acted movie.  Eclipsed by the other production of Smiley with Sir Alec Guinness.  It'll entertain you as a thrilling story.  The intellectual spy as detective.  Great stuff.",1487894400,3,586,4.640776699029126
