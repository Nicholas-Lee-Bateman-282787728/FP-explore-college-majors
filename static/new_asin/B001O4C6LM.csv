3726966,5,B001O4C6LM,"It is hard to believe that this is the first (and hopefully not the last) video recording of a live Pete Seeger concert at the height of the 60's folk revival that he was so much responsible for! If for no other reason, this DVD is a MUST for anybody who is even remotely interested in Pete Seeger's live performances.  If you have listened to his live records of that period (et Pete Seeger at the Village Gate, Sing Out Hootenanny, We Shall Overcome, etc) you can now finally match images to the sound, as he performs the classical repertoir of the golden years of the folk music boom.  To be fair, while Seeger is as good as he ever was, the Australian audience appears to be somewhat wooden, less warm and involved that one would have imagined (or seen in his later live performances in the US). Although Seeger had a large following in Australia at the time, it is possible that the songs were not as familiar to the audience as they were in the States (it is amusing to notice the absolute lack of reaction to Seeger's mention of a ""young songwriter called Bob Dylan"", who had just released ""Blowing in the Wind"" and ""Hard Rain""). Certainly, when Pete sings songs that were also commercial hits (the Hammer Song, Michael Row the Boat Ashore) people in the audience sing, bob their heads, clap the rhythm just as we are used to seeing during Seeger's live performances.

The bonus material alone is worth the price of the DVD: several Australian TV news interviews, each with one or two songs, a long excerpt from a live performance at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, and a half-hour live performance themed on Leadbelly.  A short documentary on an Australian traditional folk singer, produced by Pete and Toshi Seeger is also included.

Altogether, with almost three hours of music, this DVD is certainly excellent value for the money! Get it!",1242432000,5,1873,4.629518072289157
3726967,5,B001O4C6LM,"OK, black & white, but that actually seems to add to the nostalgic aspect of this great look at folk music as presented by Pete Seeger in 1963. He went on a 22 country, 10-month world tour blessing the world with folk music and, himself, picking up some new folk music from other countries along the way. Seeger received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1993), and this DVD shows why. It's still hard to believe the folk singer was blacklisted in the USA.

Fortunately, Australia loved his music and overlooked his politics, giving him a warm welcome and preserved it on film. Then, after a long shelf rest, it was discovered, Acorn became involved in the restoration, and the rest of the story is in the 16 page booklet that comes with the DVD. Packed full of photos, history, and the DVD contents lists.

The product description lists many of the songs included in this DVD live performance, but special note should be given to a pair of special banjo renderings of the songs ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"" and ""Allegretto from Beethoven's 7th Symphony."" Wow.  And Seeger even teaches the Aussie concert attenders to yodel to ""Way Out There"" a song done with banjo that was taken from ""Sons of the Pioneers.""

Another favorite of mine was ""I Never Will Marry"" plus one actually written by Bob Dylan but performed by Seeger, ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."" Then you'll just have to sing along with ""Michael, row The Boat Ashore"" and ""If I Had A Hammer"" (Pete's song) and others.

The concert has a total of 29 musical numbers, ending with ""I Know an Old lady Who Swallowed A Fly"", fun for any age.  There is at least 15 musical presentations as well as some interviews on the Extra Bonus Stuff. There is filmed performances of Lead Belly from 1945, the man who taught Pete Seeger to play the 12 string guitar. Seeger sings some of his songs as well.

This DVD is 160 total minutes of looking back at folk music of the Hootenanny (the word was coined by Seeger) years as well as an educational but enjoyable romp through the history of American Folk Music and some of its origin.  Perhaps this DVD would be usable by music teachers. The extras include a method to single out just one song for replay. How easy is that?

Thanks Australian Broadcasting Corporation for helping give Pete Seeger folk music back the United States.",1242259200,15,2327,4.601449275362318
3726975,5,B001O4C6LM,"I first gained an interest in Pete Seeger when I found him on YouTube, singing ""Away Out There,""  but then You Tube deleted it from their files, so I had to buy this DVD to hear it.  This DVD has the best version of this song that I have ever heard rendered.  When I was growing up, I would often have to buy an entire album just to get one song that I liked, because back in the days of vinyl records, that was often times the only way you own the songs you liked.  This DVD album has lots of other good songs besides ""Away Out There,"" but it's still my favorite. If you like this, you should go to YouTube and listen to Arlo  Guthrie sing ""The Garden Song.""  It's the black and white version shown a TV special and he's trying to get the audience to sing.  He tells the story of how he got stopped coming back from Canada.  It's funny and touching at the same time.",1374537600,,867,4.029239766081871
3726976,5,B001O4C6LM,"I can recall sitting in concerts like this in the 60's and early 70's when it took a long time for the audience to react, but react they did.
Coming from New Zealand and having spent a number of years in Australia from the late 60's, these were times that were a challenge when ""do we don't we"" ""should we or shouldn't we"" for events like the Vietnam war after having had our countries involved in the long running Malaya campaign.
We did not have the same indigenous campaigners such as your Pete seegers and Smoothers Brothers or the Weavers but we still had a strong anti war community.
Amazing what a country will do for protection of trade etc, sometimes selling its soul.
Loved the DVD as it did bring back memories.",1300924800,,722,4.43609022556391
3726977,5,B001O4C6LM,This is wonderful music and it is fascinating to watch the crowd reaction to Pete Seeger.,1279584000,,89,4.625
3726978,5,B001O4C6LM,"Pete Seeger was banned from American Television in 1963. As any great American would, he didn't stand for it. He took his act on the road, to the world. And here the great people of Reelin' In the Years provide us with the proof of his noble efforts, capturing an entire concert given in Australia. If a good man is never honored in his own country, Pete Seeger was honored in every other corner of the globe. The video is first rate, the sound is too. (Much better than on that 'Hootenanny' DVD. You remember Hootenanny, the ABC show that wanted Pete to sign a Loyalty Oath). Get the DVD. You'll see a great artist, a great spirit, and a great American at work.",1261958400,2,662,4.346774193548387
3726979,4,B001O4C6LM,"Watching this DVD, including all the beaut extras, brought a magic period back to life.  My mate and I, both Year 11 students, were at this show and I was almost apoplectic with delight at so many of the songs and scenes.  This is a great buy for the nostalgia alone but much more in terms of the history of folk music at a crucial period, before it discovered commercialism through the likes of The Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary and so on.  The extras, including interviews, a very warm introduction to his Bandstand gig by Brian Henderson and a wonderfully informal studio gig are better quality than the concert but this is to be expected. Given the network bans and the political controversy still surrounding Pete Seeger at this time, just to attend was making a statement and his repertoire would have been considered quite edgy, and in some respects still is.  The ABC concert video taping, while an inspired initiative, has a number of technical and aesthetic shortcomings (it was 47 years ago and Australian TV was just 6 years old) but it captured so much of the night and the time.  The songs include the familiar, the unknown and some that were only emerging.  To be honest some bits dragged a little, but I remember, as a teenager, thinking the same on the night, so it's an honest rendition.  It's frustrating that the ABC cameras were so limited in their shots and we see the same audience groupings over and over again (Did we really have no sense of fashion at all in 1962?)  On the other hand, Pete is wonderfully spontaneous but still utterly professional throughout a very long totally one-man show, with no props. Ignore the grainy B&W, the uneven program and those awful clothes - this is a gem.",1253059200,5,1723,4.607843137254902
3726980,5,B001O4C6LM,"Watching this video brought me back to the 1963 Newport Folk Festival which he co-founded. Pete has always been a master at getting the audience involved which enhances the experience of the concert. He is a great multitasker as well in the way he plays, sings, shouts out the next verse to be sung, changes his tone to better blend in with the audience without missing a lick.
If you know about Pete and his life and are a fan of folk don't miss this video. It will keep the songs, style and spirit of this great man alive long after he gone, which hopefully won't be for several more years. Although his voice now quivers a bit he still puts his heart and soul into his work. I don't say performances because he does so much more.",1250640000,2,732,4.311594202898551
3726981,4,B001O4C6LM,"In spite of being a bit grainy black and white, the flavor and charm of Pete still comes through.  thank goodness someone had the foresight to tape it - probably one of the first ever concert videos!  Just pure fun to watch - sure takes you back a few years (ok, more than a few).  Any Seeger or Weavers fans will be happy.",1249344000,3,323,4.095238095238095
3726982,3,B001O4C6LM,"I always found Seeger a bit of a pill. (Anyone who would get angry over Dylan going electric is inherently suspect in my book.) Even when Springsteen did that marvelous tribute album, Seeger couldn't help grousing that it should have been more political. But a PBS documentary made me like him more and appreciate all he accomplished in the face of tremendous adversity. Blacklisted in the US, he went overseas in 1963 and found a rapturous audience in Australia. This is a rough TV print but perfectly serviceable and it captures Seeger perfectly: he was never happier than when he was in front of an audience, passing along the tradition of folk music and teaching people a new song.

3726983,5,B001O4C6LM,"This is a fantastic DVD. Pete Seeger has always suprised me with his

8329373,5,B001O4C6LM,"I have been a fan of Pete Seeger, his brother Mike, and their maid Libba Cotten since 1968.
This lived up to all of my expectations - very nostalgic.
I was particularly pleased and surprised to see original footage of Leadbelly (Huddy Ledbetter)",1401753600,,245,4.72093023255814
8329374,5,B001O4C6LM,"Pete Seeger made only one concert tour of Australia and when he performed at the Melbourne Town Hall in 1963, I was not only  too young to attend  but didn't know much about Mr. Seeger or his music.  A handful of years later I discovered a wonderful  record shop located in a city basement named Discurio  which specialized in folk music.  Here, with the help of the proprietors I discovered Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, the New Lost City Ramblers, Joe Glazer and of course, Pete Seeger.  Of all the folkies, Pete will always be my favorite: great composer, wonderful singer and beautiful person with principles, grace and dignity that few people can ever hope to match.
This Melbourne concert had the good fortune of being filmed  by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and has been restored in excellent condition. The filming technique was no great shakes; remember Aussie film making and television was still pretty primitive at this time. The concert is fairly basic but who needs special effects, etc. when you have Pete on the stage; you just dread the moment when the concert ends and you have to say goodbye to the wonderful Pete.  Nothing too controversial in his choice of songs but he does squeeze in a nice  Woody Guthrie medley of union songs.  Remember the main reason for this ten month  world tour was as a result of his shameful blacklisting in his home country.  I suppose we should be grateful that  bad events can sometimes lead to good things; in this case, this wonderful tour and the subsequent boost to Australian folk music and our love of Pete.  Extras on this disc include Pete's television appearance on the Aussie Bandstand show and a homage to Leadbelly.
We recently lost Pete, a tireless troubadour promoting all that is good in the world. This rare concert footage even if a little creaky is a treasure to have preserved and will be appreciated by all admirers of this music legend and his contribution to traditional and political folk music.",1396051200,,1976,4.787610619469026
8329375,5,B001O4C6LM,It's a Pete Seeger concert!  God bless him and all that he did on this planet.  May his work and his message of peace and love continue to be spread by CDs and DVDs and the stories we tell.  We loved him and he returned the sentiment.,1392336000,,234,3.9361702127659575
