8741277,5,B0182YFYGA,"Griffin Rocks Autobot first responders (Chase, Heatwave, Blades and Boulder) are back for five more action-packed adventures in time and space!  These first responders are all about protecting their Eart friends at all costs!  My son is a huge fan of this series, but due to bus schedule and school he usually misses it on the television.  It is nice to have this DVD to pop in when he gets done with homework to catch up on his favorite Transformers and what they are up to!  The DVD is almost two hours long and broken up into five episodes.

Episodes Include:
Its A Bot Time
Unfinished Business
Switcheroo
Time After Time
The Last Of Morocco

I received this product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1455753600,2,714,4.582677165354331
