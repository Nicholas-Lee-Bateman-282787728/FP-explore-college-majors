8088819,3,B000BM7YHY,"I find Omar's review a bit exaggerated: while his description is accurate (low budget, bad acting, etc.) This is one of those movies of which value is in its cheapness. El Vampiro Teporocho is a movie with very little structure, that has the most ridicule premise: A spanish (of Spain) speaking Dracula is stranded in Mexico City after being put in a rocket by three scientists. After that it's just about surviving 80's Mexico City along with drunk guys, exploiters, and sexy girls.

If you can appreciate ""so bad its good"" kind of films, you won't be dissapointed.",1285632000,5,566,4.775510204081633
8088820,1,B000BM7YHY,"When I read the description of the movie, it seemed like a funny comedy.  It is a bad movie, with bad acting, poor dialogue, low budget.  Just reviewing it makes me angry I wasted money and time on this aberration.",1266624000,,214,4.325
