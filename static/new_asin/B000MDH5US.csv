The only downside I found was I thought ""Dracula"" was a lot more attractive than the main female actress. She should have been in the main role.",1256256000,,207,4.333333333333333
8168067,4,B000MDH5US,"When this movie started and I heard the first dialogue, I was thinking after five minutes I will be turning off this movie and feeling disappointed for choosing it. However, this movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  This movie details the story of a couple and how their relationship evolves. There is also a ton of comedy on man/woman relationships and marriage. Even the soundtrack was nice. If you like comedy, I would recommend this movie.",1168560000,3,451,4.782051282051282
