758196,5,6304017618,"I'm not familiar with the other movies in the series but, apparently, this is the only one I need to see.
Sharon Tate is the star of this film.  This is her best role, finely displaying her talent for comedy.  From the moment she comes on the scene as a clumsy Danish tour guide to the last,  where she seduces Dean Martin (Matt Helm), she was well suited for her role.
To all serious movie collectors, this is a must have for your collection.",1049155200,8,443,4.25
758197,5,6304017618,"This flick was hysterical, on every level.  It was funny at points it was supposed to be, and when it wasn't.  Not to be missed - especially since Dean was tanked throughout, and slurs his way through the script.  Sharon is actually very very funny.  I love this film.",1015891200,3,268,4.408163265306122
758198,4,6304017618,"Martial artists will be delighted by the Wrecking Crew.
Several prominent martial artists of the sixties appear and the tuxedoed villians, Bruce Lee himself is credited as the ""karate advisor"".",996796800,,193,5.466666666666667
758199,5,6304017618,"Interestingly enough, this movie, made in 1969, seemed to influence all the James Bond movies of the 1970s much more than the Bond movie released at the same time, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The Bond producers must have seen that this campy action film more epitomized the changing attitude of film goers more than that low grossing spy melodrama. While not a great film, it is an extremely entertaining romp that rushes along at breakneck pace, covering up any flaws as a result. Best in the Matt Helm series by a longshot and a must for anyone who enjoyed the James Bond comic book adventures of the 1970s. Martin at his coolest, Tate at her sexiest and Nigel Green at his suavest and meanest. Bruce Lee choreographed the fight scenes, which preceded the Kung Fu movie craze of the early 1970s. And that soundtrack screamed action! Overall, an innovative classic, not to be confused with the other Helm offerings.",985392000,7,921,4.7625
758200,4,6304017618,"Final Installment of the Matt Helm series  ( although a fifth Matt Helm movie was  schelduled but never filmed. Dean Martin plays U.S  counterpart to James Bond  in  this swinging plot to steal 1 billion in gold  . Cheesy  songs by Dean but great score by  Hugo Montenegro ( wish the soundtrack was  on vinyl or CD)and very funny performance by Sharon Tate- this has to be  her best film role of the six films she co- starred in.  Great 60's  fashions, 60's glamour and even Tina Louise in a small role.  Kung Fu  Action as Bruce Lee was the advisor for the fight scenes .  Look for Chuck  Norris in a bit part.",938908800,7,611,4.228070175438597
7858982,1,6304017618,"DVD doesn't play in my Samsung player, which is only 2 years old.  I didn't see anything when I ordered it that is was for region 2, and would not play in US.  Being new to Amazon, I failed to see ""return window"", so I guess it's my loss.",1510012800,,238,3.836734693877551
7858983,2,6304017618,"""The Wrecking Crew"" (1968) pairs Dean Martin's booze-fueled spy with lively Sharon Tate amid the usual explosions, chases and martial-arts interludes. Typically laid-back Matt Helm kitsch suffers from a weak script and reduced budget yet offers slightly more entertainment value than the previous two installments. Cult director Phil Karlson adds a modicum of flair to Dino's fourth (and final) espionage spoof. Ironically,  the high-camp series would have a regrettable influence on Roger Moore's tired 007 reign.",1483747200,,514,5.7631578947368425

7858989,1,6304017618,"This is a drama film from year 1942. It is not about Hal Blaine, Tommy Tedesco, Carole Kaye and the rest of them. Just to let you know, so you won't be disappointed. Actually, I think this is a swindle. The price is high, but the publishing date refers to Tommy Tedesco's film of the same name. There is no data of the publisher or distributor. Here's the original film:

7858990,3,6304017618,"The fighting scenes and the idea that Denmark has MOUNTAINS makes this in the class of a turkey - I mean - a spoof is OK - but you still have to do your research....  What if we found a wonderful beach in the film The Sound Of Music(with Austrian locations???)???
What saves this film is the comedy of Sharon Tate. She`s right on target every time she appears and the film should be granted many TV-screenings because of her... The music is pure 60s(quite amusing...)  The scene in?which Matt Helm,  upon seeing a dead Linka(Elke Sommer), informs Freya Carlson ""That could have been you"" - and her stubborn denials - puts tears 2 1s eyes - knowing what happened to Sharon a year later....
It is campy but by now I enjoy the film because it is so hilarious....  If you watch Sharon`s films... you`ll see she works on her magic differently in all her six films..... She`s a diabolique witch in EYE OF THE DEVIL, a fragile starlet in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, and a teasing ill-fated-teenager in THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS(all 1967)....",1089158400,11,1030,4.551351351351351
7858991,5,6304017618,"I saw ""The Wrecking Crew"" when I was kid on TV in the 80's. I only saw it once but never forgot it. It was funny and a bit like ""Austin Powers"" meets ""James Bond"". Sharon Tate was beautiful, I think she was wonderful in comedy. She plays a tough but sexy undercover agent like ""Charlies Angels"", she does some great leg kicks, I read she worked with ""Bruce Lee"" for this! I think Dean Martin was a bit tipsy during the filming LOL! Seems like he was having alot of fun in the Matt Helm movies. I'm hopeing this will come out on DVD soon, I'd love to see it again!",1088035200,6,563,4.035714285714286
