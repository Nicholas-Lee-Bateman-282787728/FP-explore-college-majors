3093040,5,B0012Q3SZA,"Mike Birbiglia never fails to entertain, and this DVD will not disappoint!  Birbiglia is an ""everyday"" guy who will make you laugh about the day to day activities the rest of us can't make funny.  If you aren't laughing while watching this, you don't have a sense of humor!",1210809600,,273,4.551020408163265
3093041,5,B0012Q3SZA,"This is a must-own DVD. Mike Birbiglia mixes a natural genius for storytelling with amusing and sardonic views of his own experiences. When Mike has been in Chicago, I have arrived to his shows early enough to get a front row seat every time. Not so much because the comedy is more enjoyable up close, but once you get a few rows back Mike starts to resemble my 78-year-old uncle, Cliff.

If you're not familiar with Birbiglia already, Mike is like a more-relevant, less-alcoholic, and endlessly more amusing version of Cliff. And Cliff tries, too. He's always asking me if I've heard the one about the doctor and the nurse or playing some sort of gag in which he pretends his breathing machine is malfunctioning. Been done before, Cliff!

But Mike is an original, and it's impossible not to become engaged in his imaginative and personal comedy. Buy this DVD, and check his website to find out when he's coming to your city.",1210809600,,925,4.668711656441718
3093042,5,B0012Q3SZA,"While the title is true, I did rent this video, and absolutely loved it.  I've followed his stand-up for several years, seen his Comedy Central specials, seen him twice (drove 2 hours each way just to see him in Flagstaff, AZ on the Unpronounceable Last Name Tour with Zach Galifianakis last fall) and listened to both his albums several times.  This DVD contains about 50% new material and 50% of stuff that's on the other CDs, if I remember correctly.  But even so, I saw him again a few weeks ago knowing most of his material, and I still laughed so hard, I had trouble breathing.  Mike's delivery is about perfect as you can get, his anecdotes reference each other perfectly, and his voice inflection and mannerisms add so much to the experience of his jokes.  He's probably one of the best comedians in the business, and much better (though unfortunately not as well known) than people like Carlos Mencia and Dane Cook (gag).

This DVD is a must have for comedy aficionados or for people who like marijuana, I would imagine.  If you've never seen him or heard of him, this is about as good a place as any to start.  And the ""for the fans only"" section is really great, and shows him and Joe Bags in their natural habitat - a tour bus.

If he comes to your town (which looks more likely now that CBS screwed him on his pilot) you owe it to yourself to see him.  I guarantee it'll be worth the two drink minimum and the $15 tuna sandwich.  And sign up for his secret public journal.  Spam has never been so funny.

You'd be surprised.",1210809600,,1537,4.3886925795053005
3093043,5,B0012Q3SZA,"I am a fan o'Mike Birbiglia and ""What I Should've Said Was Nothing"" is hilarious and keeps me laughing long after I've seen the DVD or listened to his CDs. Definitely worth every single cent.",1210809600,,191,4.485714285714286

3093045,5,B0012Q3SZA,"I am a Birbigs fan. I was introduced to his humor several years ago on the nationally syndicated Bob and Tom show. Since then I have seen Mike's standup several times and never miss him when he is in Austin. His ability to take everyday events and discover the humor that is buried within reminds me of some of the greatest comedians of all time. Go listen to the classic Cosby albums and you will see the same kind of genius in Mike's work.  If you've ever felt ""packward"" listen to how Mike deals with it.

Damn you Eckersley....",1210809600,,531,4.353535353535354

3093047,4,B0012Q3SZA,"I am not a Mike Birbiglia fan. This DVD is worth it though. This is pretty much the same material as on the Public Secret Journal Live but seeing Birbiglia do the routines adds a lot to their humor.
The show itself is 60 minutes, the other 60 minutes include extra concert footage and clips from early performances.
If you are a Birbiglia fan, you will really like this DVD. If you went to one of his shows and liked what you saw, start with this instead of the CD.",1210204800,2,465,4.177777777777778

3093067,4,B0012Q3SZA,I think he is a really funny comic. He isn't very loud or in your face with his jokes. He mostly tells stories about his life and they are really good.,1381881600,2,151,3.903225806451613
3093068,5,B0012Q3SZA,"In an age where so many comics offer up one foul mouthed insult after the next, it is so refreshing to come upon someone  who reminds us that you can be clean and insightful, and still be hysterical.  What makes Birbiglia's humor work so well is his ability to take experiences from his own life and relate not only the humor but the pathos to his audience.

You should also check out his CD Sleepwalk With Me, which is truly amazing.",1368144000,2,434,4.333333333333333
3093069,4,B0012Q3SZA,Mike is so calm about what he is telling the audience.  He does not do shock humor.  He really relates humorous tales and experiences.,1367452800,,134,4.541666666666667

3093071,5,B0012Q3SZA,He's really funny.  Kept me laughing throughout.  Seems like such an unassuming guy.  His humor was really great.  I'll be looking for the next one for sure.,1367280000,,157,4.703703703703703

3093083,5,B0012Q3SZA,"there are few stand up comics whom people of all ages can enjoy.  jerry seinfeld is the most well known of these. mike is another.  his delivery is low key and deadpan.  it draws upon the ordinariness of his life.  he is often the the person making a comment which no one should say out loud because it will follow you forever.  mike has drawers full of these off the cuff comments!  i have only seen him on video, not in person, but it might be fun to see him live.  i recommend this show highly and the whole family can watch it, a real plus.

3093086,5,B0012Q3SZA,I really love this guy's sense of humor and wit.  He is sort of melodramatic and subtle but his humor comes from a very genuine place.  Great story teller.,1363305600,2,155,4.310344827586207
3093087,3,B0012Q3SZA,I definitely remember Mike Birbiglia being funnier. This whole performance was only worth a few chuckles. Not terrible but not his best.,1362182400,,136,5.2272727272727275

3093091,4,B0012Q3SZA,Mike is very low-key.... but funny if you share his type of cerebral comedy-- which I do.  If you enjoy him on This American Life - you'll enjoy this video.,1360800000,,156,4.2
3093102,5,B0012Q3SZA,I was first introduced to Mike Birbiglia by listening to comedy snippets on one of my phone apps. After watching this video I became a fan.  His laid-back style and delivery almost lull you into a feeling of hearing your friend tell you a story. Then you realize you are being entertained. I laughed out loud throughout the whole video. I'm even smiling writing this.,1360454400,,367,4.6461538461538465
3093103,5,B0012Q3SZA,"One of the few modern stand-up comedians who holds up to repeated viewings. Very funny program. I love comedians who rely on skill and fresh perspective, and not on being rude or insulting - Mike is one of those truly talented ones.",1354406400,2,232,4.5476190476190474
3093104,5,B0012Q3SZA,"I'm a fan of filthy humor, but Mike Birbiglia is not very dirty with his comedy, and he's my favorite comedian! His jokes and outlook on life are relatable, but also creative and hilarious. I'm getting this for my parents for Christmas.",1353888000,2,236,4.642857142857143
3093105,2,B0012Q3SZA,I was so excited to see this and it was a let down - we both fell asleep. There were funny parts here and there and far between.,1330992000,,128,3.607142857142857
3093106,5,B0012Q3SZA,Mike Birbiglia is hilarious in this DVD.  He does mostly self-deprecating type humor and he can be appreciated by a wide audience.  This is a good one for entertaining friends or alone.  I definitely recommend it.,1304640000,,213,4.861111111111111
3093107,5,B0012Q3SZA,I just finished watching this DVD and I thought it was super funny. He doesn't swear much only uses a couple bad words. I loved every minute. I laughed my butt off the whole time. This was a birthday gift and it was one of the best ones I've gotten.,1297209600,,249,4.0
3093108,5,B0012Q3SZA,Mike Birbiglia is the funniest comedian I have ever seen!  My girlfriend and I watch this over and over and laugh every time!,1296259200,2,125,4.434782608695652
3093109,3,B0012Q3SZA,"I like what I've seen and heard from Mike Birbiglia over the years, but this is the first time I've watched a whole show.  For starters, this definitely is not ""family friendly.""  He has a whole bit about sex at Catholic colleges and condoms and abortions and molestation.  In other shows, he's also done these anti-religion rants that are NOT necessary in his show.  So, that pretty much ruined it for me because I like DVDs that I can watch with my kids.  Other than that, the DVD is quite repetitive from material I've seen on youtube from other concerts, so I pretty much knew where everything was going.  My wife had never seen him at all.  She liked it, but rarely actually laughed out loud.  Even though I'm no evangelical Christian, Tim Hawkins' first DVD is clean and LOL funny -- even my atheist sister was laughing.",1288656000,3,826,4.533783783783784
3093110,5,B0012Q3SZA,"Mike Birbiglia does it again.

3093122,5,B0012Q3SZA,"While not my favorite comedian, Birbigs is a very talented storyteller and always entertains me.  You can always tell how good a comedian is by how many times you can watch the DVD.  Some are funny, but only 1 or 2 times.  I can watch this one over and over, along with Brian Regan, Pablo Francisco, Daniel Tosh, etc....  It up there with my favorites.

Buy it if you enjoy ""intelligent"" humor.",1219017600,3,394,4.416666666666667
3093123,5,B0012Q3SZA,"Mike Birbiglia is hilarious.  His comedy is spot-on, I love the DVD and all the extras.  He is quotable, too!  I apologize for having nothing to say, but without any criticism, my notes are brief.",1215302400,7,196,4.542857142857143
3093124,5,B0012Q3SZA,"This is non stop laughs the whole way through.  It's smart too, but doesn't make you have to think.  I'm not saying it's likely, but it wouldn't surprise me if 20 years from now this DVD is seen as a break through work by one of the world's greatest comedy talents.  This DVD is that good.

The two bonus videos are fantastic too.  One is basically throwing in another whole comedy set of Mike's previous material (which isn't available previously on DVD).  The other is a tour diary that not only is entertaining but is a very good length for something like this; not just a 5 minute behind the scenes.

Not convinced?  Here's how good this DVD is for the unconvinced:  I'm taking my siblings and Mom to see Mike in Detroit and afterwards I'm giving them each this DVD as a gift.  These aren't casual friends who invited me to their wedding to get more loot...this is family that I will be receiving future gifts from and therefore need to impress with my gift-giving.

Buy it, you won't thank me because you'll be laughing so hard it would be absurd to think you'd pause and think ""boy I'm glad I believed that random reviewer on Amazon"", but it will be the best thing you do that day (don't watch it on a lottery drawing day, just in case).",1212537600,3,1243,4.360869565217391
3093125,5,B0012Q3SZA,"Having seen Mike live in Madison, WI, I knew exactly what I was getting into. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not repeat any of his old material from his previous show. This DVD was hilarious and showed Mike at his best. He has this sarcastic, observational humor that most people can relate to. He is a talented and smart performer, even though he comes off as a regular guy. If I met this guy at a party, I would be hanging with him all night.",1212451200,4,452,4.206896551724138
3093126,5,B0012Q3SZA,"Like I said, I am a Mike Birbiglia fan, so this positive review should be of no surprise.  The DVD is hilarious, much like his specials on Comedy Central.  I would love to compare it to a live show but until he gets his BirbigButt to Fresno, CA, I won't be able to do that.  Oh sure, he has time for shows in all the big cities (oops that is, unless something more important comes along, no thanks to CBS!), but he doesn't make the CA Central Valley a top priority.  That's okay, Mike, we will just watch you on this great DVD until you find it in your busy schedule to visit us!  That is the kind of people we are in Fresno.  So from one Birbig fan to another - fantastic DVD!",1211414400,,677,4.014925373134329
3093127,4,B0012Q3SZA,"Having heard Mike on the radio several times, owning (and repeatedly listening to) his CD ""Dog Years,"" and seeing him live I can honestly say - Mike Birbiglia is the funniest comedian out there!  The Secret Public Journal is just the latest of the greatest comedy you are sure to enjoy.  The only down side: you can't fit all of the best jokes into one DVD!  Love you Gerbigaboo!",1211155200,5,379,4.463768115942029

But upon the recommendation of friends, I checked him out. Damn. This guy is what I have been looking for. Finally, someone from my generation who is able to eloquently make you laugh without resorting to crudeness or over-done profanity. Birbiglia delivers.

While I do not own this DVD, I am certain that if I was to buy it, I would end up writing an even MORE positive review for the set. Until then, I will recommend it purely on the quality of the performer.

3093152,5,B0012Q3SZA,"Mike Birbiglia is a pure talent and this DVD shows off his comedic skills.  His humor is not offensive and in your face, but talks about everyday things and stuff that he loves like pizza.  He humor is self depreciating, but not in a ""woe is me"" kind of way, but in a way that anyone can relate to.  If he ever came to Minneapolis, which he needs to already, I would not mind taking my kid to his show.  My kid wouldn't understand all of the jokes, but Birbigs is clean enough that I wouldn't have to cover his ears throughout.",1210896000,17,527,4.137254901960785

I can think of maybe five, if I count the eternally youthful Steve Martin. The point is, even your dog would feel happier after spending an hour and a half watching Mike Birbiglia tell jokes, which depend as much on his endearing candor and genuine desire for the world to work in a basically rational and un-terrible way as on his daffy, quizzical, and very comical delivery.

Mike's delivery is about perfect as you can get, his anecdotes reference each other perfectly, and his voice inflection and mannerisms add so much to the experience of his jokes.  He's probably one of the best comedians in the business, and much better (though unfortunately not as well known) than people like Carlos Mencia and Dane Cook (gag).

This DVD is a must have for comedy aficionados or for people who like marijuana, I would imagine.  If you've never seen him or heard of him, this is about as good a place as any to start.  And the ""for the fans only"" section is really great, and shows him and Joe Bags in their natural habitat - a tour bus.

If he comes to your town (which looks more likely now that CBS screwed him on his pilot) you owe it to yourself to see him.  I guarantee it'll be worth the two drink minimum and the $15 tuna sandwich.  And sign up for his secret public journal.  Spam has never been so funny.

You'd be surprised.",1210809600,,1537,4.3886925795053005

3327542,5,B0012Q3SZA,"I am a Birbigs fan. I was introduced to his humor several years ago on the nationally syndicated Bob and Tom show. Since then I have seen Mike's standup several times and never miss him when he is in Austin. His ability to take everyday events and discover the humor that is buried within reminds me of some of the greatest comedians of all time. Go listen to the classic Cosby albums and you will see the same kind of genius in Mike's work.  If you've ever felt ""packward"" listen to how Mike deals with it.

For starters, this definitely is not ""family friendly.""  He has a whole bit about sex at Catholic colleges and condoms and abortions and molestation.  In other shows, he's also done these anti-religion rants that are NOT necessary in his show.  So, that pretty much ruined it for me because I like DVDs that I can watch with my kids.  Other than that, the DVD is quite repetitive from material I've seen on youtube from other concerts, so I pretty much knew where everything was going.  My wife had never seen him at all.  She liked it, but rarely actually laughed out loud.  Even though I'm no evangelical Christian, Tim Hawkins' first DVD is clean and LOL funny -- even my atheist sister was laughing.",1288656000,3,826,4.533783783783784

3327621,5,B0012Q3SZA,"This is non stop laughs the whole way through.  It's smart too, but doesn't make you have to think.  I'm not saying it's likely, but it wouldn't surprise me if 20 years from now this DVD is seen as a break through work by one of the world's greatest comedy talents.  This DVD is that good.

The two bonus videos are fantastic too.  One is basically throwing in another whole comedy set of Mike's previous material (which isn't available previously on DVD).  The other is a tour diary that not only is entertaining but is a very good length for something like this; not just a 5 minute behind the scenes.

Not convinced?  Here's how good this DVD is for the unconvinced:  I'm taking my siblings and Mom to see Mike in Detroit and afterwards I'm giving them each this DVD as a gift.  These aren't casual friends who invited me to their wedding to get more loot...this is family that I will be receiving future gifts from and therefore need to impress with my gift-giving.

Buy it, you won't thank me because you'll be laughing so hard it would be absurd to think you'd pause and think ""boy I'm glad I believed that random reviewer on Amazon"", but it will be the best thing you do that day (don't watch it on a lottery drawing day, just in case).",1212537600,3,1243,4.360869565217391

He is a talented and smart performer, even though he comes off as a regular guy. If I met this guy at a party, I would be hanging with him all night.",1212451200,4,452,4.206896551724138

I would love to compare it to a live show but until he gets his BirbigButt to Fresno, CA, I won't be able to do that.  Oh sure, he has time for shows in all the big cities (oops that is, unless something more important comes along, no thanks to CBS!), but he doesn't make the CA Central Valley a top priority.  That's okay, Mike, we will just watch you on this great DVD until you find it in your busy schedule to visit us!  That is the kind of people we are in Fresno.

While I do not own this DVD, I am certain that if I was to buy it, I would end up writing an even MORE positive review for the set. Until then, I will recommend it purely on the quality of the performer.

I can think of maybe five, if I count the eternally youthful Steve Martin. The point is, even your dog would feel happier after spending an hour and a half watching Mike Birbiglia tell jokes, which depend as much on his endearing candor and genuine desire for the world to work in a basically rational and un-terrible way as on his daffy, quizzical, and very comical delivery.
