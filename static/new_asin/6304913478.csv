7879087,4,6304913478,"Given that this was the only surviving print of this film, I can forgive the splices and deterioration in this DVD.  A very enjoyable early Fox musical.  The only problem with this Image DVD is during the opening credits.  As part of the Wade Williams Collection, they have superimposed a new copyright during the opening credits.  This is an unforgiveable desecration of the film.  New copyrights should only be shown before or after the actual film, so as not to mar them.  I've never seen this done before on any of the Williams Collection features.  This would have been a perfect release is not for the disrespect they showed this film.",1241395200,5,641,4.7207207207207205
7879088,4,6304913478,"Is the acting and script cheesy? Yes! Is the DVD film capture grainy and scratched? Yes! Do the men wear their trousers belted under their armpits? Yes! Is the plot thin, the hair bleached platinum, the eyebrows plucked to obscurity, and the sets beyond cheap? Yes! All that combines into a DVD that I really enjoyed. There's nothing more comforting on a cold winter night (or a hot summer night) than cozying up with a 70+ year old movie and a glass of Cabernet. Alice Faye (just a newbie in this film) shows us what producers and directors saw in her: a sprite-like smile, pleasant contralto singing voice and solid acting potential. If you're looking for Academy Award worthy film-making/acting or over-the-top Busby Berkeley choreography, this film won't do it for you. It's amusing... yet, nowhere near the level of ""The Gang's All Here"" or any number of other Alice Faye films. That said, the ""Mae West meets Tarzan"" dressing room doors routine at the end of this film IS pretty bizarre. If you get a kick out of the ambiance of early '30s lighthearted comedies or comedy/musicals... golly dolly, this is swell. Why not splurge $2.99 and rent it Unbox style?",1201392000,2,1164,4.767326732673268
7879089,3,6304913478,"365 nights in hollywood is a great movie ,however it is a pity that
 the quality is not that great. It is good to see Alice Faye before
 she became a household name. James Dunn was very underated and i believe
 Hollywood could have done more with him",1188000000,2,250,4.166666666666667
7879090,3,6304913478,"A very early film, thought to be lost, showcases Alice Faye in typical role---however she seems somewhat uneasy in this film, not her usual relaxed and in control self.  The film is certainly not the quality of her later films, and the story line is a bit jerky and often comes to a stop.  The DVD has passable video and sound, but this is not a film you will be wanting to see over and over!!

Best part is at end, when Alice sings----",1140652800,9,436,4.166666666666667
7879091,3,6304913478,"Here is Alice Faye in her first year in Hollywood and she portrays a shy girl trying to establish herself as an actress; in fact, exactly what she was at the time. This doesn't mean that the film or Alice are very good. The script is weak, the production values mediocre and the supporting cast, including the tedious comedians Mitchell and Durant, minor so this is a B grade film all round. Alice really only comes alive with any confidence in the 2 song numbers and she looks and sounds good in both.

This apparantly was the last remaining print of the film so the quality is not very good too. For die-hard fans, it is better than nothing.",1126656000,5,643,4.4033613445378155
7879092,2,6304913478,"I'm a huge fan of early thirties pre-code musicals but it almost goes without saying that there's even approaching not enough of them available on DVD.
So you'd think this would be a must-have purchase for any lover of art-deco cinema, especially considering the movie's pedigree (long thought lost, last remaining print, rare example from a studio whose back catalog is mostly long since disappeared).
Well - from a purely scholarly point of view it's fairly interesting; in that it's very different from Warners, Paramount or MGM musicals from the same era. It also features a comedy double act (Mitchell & Durant) whose clumsy knockabout slapstick looks so primative to be virually neanderthal (think of Anthony Quinn & Alan Ladd doing a poor imitation of Laurel & Hardy and you'll be close.).  Alice Faye is very cute, but given very little to do except emote, plus early on she's asked to do a specific imitation of Jean Harlow (fair enough, Fox were marketing her as their version of the Platinum Blonde, but did they have to be SO blatantly obvious?).
Essentially it's 42nd Street in a studio, with a paired down cast and production values two steps up from a poverty-row production. There's only two proper musical numbers and both are under-rehearsed and unimpressive. You will not be humming the choons/tunes after watching this.
DVD quality is fair, there's some deterioration, but it's the best you'll ever see considering it's the only surviving print. No extras to speak of, except some fun trailers for 50s sci-fi and monster movies.
Although I applaud the fact that a rare musical is, after nearly 70 years once more available to the public, I'd much rather have any number of pre-code musicals available on DVD (any of the Gold-Diggers movies for example) or perhaps some of the long unseen Clara Bow vehicles from her Fox era. It would also be much more preferable to see such Alice Faye vehicles as the original George White's Scandals.
365 Nights in Hollywood fun while it lasts, but with it's forgetable supporting cast and lacklustre production ""it just don't cut the mustard"". Won't keep you coming back for more and certainly not recommended for those unfamiliar with this era of film-making. I suggest they check out some Busby Berkeley movies, even if it does mean getting them on - gasp! - VHS!!",1067904000,16,2322,4.893401015228426
7879093,3,6304913478,"This was Alice's 4th film and in it she does seem alittle un-at -ease still. She plays the part of Alice Perkins an aspiring movie star who enrols at the acting school run by J. Walter Delmar who is only interesting in lining his pockets with ill-gained money. Mananging to obtain some money from a naive rich lad he engages as been producer James Dunn playing  Jimmy Dale  to produce a new show.  To cut a long story short he makes a hit and makes Alice a star and falls in love with her. Alice comes alive when she does her two big production numbers.  The first ""Yes to You"" sees her with twelve chorus boys and dressed very alluringly in a black sequined dress. The second, ""My Future Star"" sees Alice with a chorus of girls and the film's star James Dunn acting the part of a producer who cannot decide what mold to put Alice as Alice Perkins in - Jean Harlow, Mae West or Lupe Veles.  Alice was now  becoming noticed and her reviews were favourable. I love Alice in all her pictures as to me she can't do wrong but it is a collectors item and if you over-look the peroxide hair and the pencil thin eyebrows and the rather amateurish acting you will find a film well worth buying and then compare this new girl to the wonderful star she became.  it is a good film and I certainly recommend it.",1057795200,11,1298,4.252032520325203
