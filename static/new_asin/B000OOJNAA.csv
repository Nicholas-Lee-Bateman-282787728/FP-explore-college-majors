8185734,5,B000OOJNAA,Don't say Francis Schaeffer didn't tell us all where society was heading in the 1970s! He saw postmodernism coming a mile-off and was spot on in his analysis of Relativism's legacy. This is a gut-wrenching indictment of 'sociological law' and the cheapness with which the West treats human life today.,1487289600,,301,5.04

8185739,4,B000OOJNAA,"An excellent pro-life tool for teaching, discussion groups, or self-study. Released in 1979, the material is less dated, but actually takes on more of an eerie prophetic feel in light of the moral direction the United States has taken in the decades that followed. The arguments presented in the series against abortion, infanticide & euthenasia are clear, logical and hold up well.

This is the follow up to the classic 1977 video series by Schaeffer, ""How Then Shall We Live"". That ten part series is truly a masterpiece of Christian thought & theology as viewed through the light of Western World History. This five part series, which IS ACTUALLY ON ONE DVD & NOT TWO DVD'S, ALSO RUNS 240 MINUTES TOTAL, AND NOT 150 MINUTES AS LISTED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. There are 5 episodes, each running approximately 48 minutes.

The production values are actually higher than its predecessor, with numerous animated segments and conceptual segments that were acted out. Some of these perhaps go a little over-the-top in terms of melodrama (ie: showing a live baby in a cage & and animated chorus line of doctors suctioning fetuses). However, I respect the producers attempt to explore new directions in contrast to ""How Then Shall We live"". Episode 4 in particular has very well done segments in it. The final episode has a very clear presentation of the Gospel, and the series does not show actual aborted fetuses or abortions being performed. Some of the music used is very dated and perhaps slightly inappropriate for the serious topic being discussed.

Ideally, a similar updated series should be made with current info & production values.",1332892800,10,1642,4.985401459854015
8185740,5,B000OOJNAA,"This film and the accompanying book--please read it--were pivotal factors in mobilizing evangelicals to join Catholics and others in opposing abortion and the general devaluation of life stemming from secularism in the West. (This is woke me up from my noncommital slumbers on these topics in 1979.) For its historical significance and because of its arguments and graphic (but tasteful) depictions, it should still be taken seriously nearly thirty years (and about 45 million abortions) later.

The elder Schaeffer was an incisive and prophetic thinker. He is teamed with a world- renowed surgeon, C. Everett Koop, who became Surgeon General under President Ronald Reagan. Generally speaking, Schaeffer makes the philosophical arguments and Koop gives the reports on the medical dimensions regarding abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia.

This film and book were prophetic, sadly; much of what was warmed about has come to pass. Infanticide was not legal then (1979). Until the partial birth abortion ban was signed into law under President George W. Bush, it was. President Bill Clinton refused to sign the bill banning this ghastly and inhuman procedure that insured the death of viable fetuses (human beings made in the image of God). Now his equally pro-abortion wife is running for president.

The filming is good and sometimes creatively pleasing; but it is not thoroughly professional by the standards of the day. But that should not stop you from being moved and informed by the film. Franky Schaeffer (as he was known then) directed and produced it. He has since left film making (and has left the evangelical faith).

May a new generation of Christians (and others) will watch the films and read the book. May those who did so years ago return to them and recommit themselves to ""chose life"" on every level. The dehumanization of humans continues haunts us, especially now that many want to create human embryos in order to extract their stem cells. The cost is the embryo's lives. Moreover, in 2005, Terri Schiavo, a woman who was neither in a coma nor dying, was murdered after a grueling legal and existential drama--all because her husband wanted her dead.

Who's next?",1200787200,12,2185,5.126404494382022
8185741,4,B000OOJNAA,"A very good film, for the most part! However, The first two episodes are not very good. "" Little"" Franky Shaeffer tried to be too creative and emotional, and the results are kind of a joke for such a serious subject. Some of the animation and music are pretty offensive as well. Franky should have kept the same format as "" How Should We Then Live?"" The last two episodes really great!",1184457600,5,385,4.361111111111111
