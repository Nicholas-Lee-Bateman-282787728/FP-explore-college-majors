1959089,2,B0000YEE6C,"Picture this: The biggest rave of the year is about to start on a island in the middle of nowhere, complete with the party lights and ladies and all the alcoholic trimmings you can ingest, and you're invited. All you have to do is get yourself and your friends to a boat departing for it by 5:00, strap on your party privies, and go all out.
Now picture this: You arrive at the dock, find the place a little on the empty side while you're waiting for the three ladies you're with to arrive, and that's when you figure out that you've missed your ticket to play by all of fifteen minutes. So you know you need to get there, even if you have to charter a fishing boat with a questionable two-man crew and getting there after the initial celebration kickoff.
Now picture that, but with a horror movie twist: When you arrive, you find everything in order, all the stuff still standing and waiting and blinking those neon blinks you envisioned, but the people that should be accompanying them are nowhere to be found. All you find are bloody tatters forecasting a probability that disaster has taken place, and you also notice the other not-quite living and not-quite-dead things traveling keeping the stuff company as well.
Its sad to say this in retrospect, but this movie really had the potential to be something entertaining. It had a basis that was build on the ever-giving blood and violence some many love to partake in, enough commercial backing to actually make money with the project and to spawn sequels if it were done correctly, and something of a schematic to draw on. All a director really had to do was take the plotline to the zombie shooter, change it around so it would work outside of the videogame arena, and then go to town with all the ideas they could dream up. Add to that the fact that the ""House of the Dead"" videogame series were widely known, that the trailers for the film said that this would be worth watching, and you had yourself a ballgame. Unfortunately, all of that made me think I should see it, that it might be good because I have always been a sucker for zombie movies (even some pretty bad ones), and that this might fit into the new trend to make horror bigger and better. Yes, what could go wrong?
Everything.
Instead of being a movie that was scary or funny or something shoved somewhere in-between, House of the Dead simply started out as a bad piece of cinema and ended as a well-rounded diet of annoying and tiresome. Not only did it sport a cast that didn't seem to understand the meaning of the word ""acting,"" but the way the zombies worked in this film and some of the mechanics of the directors vision (if we can call it that) were tiresome.
First, the zombies were something that went beyond being disposable, with them somehow managing to slaughter droves of people without so much as a sign left in the initial (and not shown, to make matters all-the-more boring) struggle but still being fragile enough to be take out with kicks, bullets to the arms or legs, and even the occasional panic-hurled jar.
Next, there were the occasional shots of the wonderfully-aged videogame that appear for absolutely no reason and take up space in moments that were supposed to be both cryptic and dramatic and worth wathcing. Sometimes, when zombies were being shot, the all-too-human monsters and their exploding heads would be replaced with a pixelated image (and a bad one at that) of a zombie, some slash marks made by it, and a ""1st Player, press start"" icon in the corner.
After that, there were the forced portions of the movie that tried to work in zombies and action but did none of the above with any clarity, the scenes of the rave of the year that didn't look like much of a party, and the interaction of completely worthless characters as they struggled to survive. Yes, the party of the year seemed to consist of one stage, a bar, some tents and beanbags, and an island with a score or two of party-people. It was then visited by five people, some additional weight they brought with them, and some cops that didn't make me want them to live or die; their actions as rigid as some of the zombies. And did I mention the horrible plot and the ""outhouse of doom"" that was, for some reason, supposed to be scary (and a laboratory) to boot?
Perhaps, had the movie not been hyped to be good, I could have forgiven it and I could have laughed. I actually like quite a few Italian movies with zombies that aren't that effect-prone, and I like many of the Trouma releases despite their lack of budgets. I can even go as far as to say that I enjoy movies that look like they were shot on camcorders from time to time. The thing I couldn't forgive in this is that it pitched itself to be something it wasn't, causing me to think I'd missed something when I skipped it at the movies when I hadn't. Added to that, the DVD features are meaningless; with 3 deleted scenes, some storyboard ""could have been"" scenarios, a little ""how we made our cheap monsters move"" skit, and commentary. At least the nudity in the beginning, all be it a short drive down ""swimming topless in a thong"" lane, was nice. That's the only thing keeping it out of the one-star gutter.",1075161600,3,5194,4.497354497354498

I wanted to see an all out war between the zombies and the human survivors and that is exactly what I got!  This movie has all the ingredients for a FUN movie, not an Academy Award winner, but a very fun movie.  Zombies slaughtering humans, humans kung-fuing and mowing down zombies with automatic weapons, thrills, chills and even some gorgeous ladies stripping down for us.

As an ode to 'B' movies and really cheesy awful horror movies, the action never lets up and the zombies even know martial arts. It's incredibly funny during the shootout in the cemetery. And they even threw in an immortal zombie who's looking for pretty body parts to add to his collection. Man, that artifact can move like Hammer!

This movie is so bad is should not have even been in theaters.

1959102,1,B0000YEE6C,"HOUSE OF THE DEAD is about a group of twenty-somethings, on their way to a rave party. Said party is on the dreaded ""Isle del Morte"" (yep, island of death). These young people must get to this rave at all cost, so, of course, the fact that the captain (Jurgen Prochnow- THE KEEP) and first mate (Clint Howard- EVILSPEAK) of their transport are insufferable turds, is of no consequence! They even pay a fortune for the trip! This must be some party! Meanwhile, on the infamous island, other young people are on the beach -a lovely female is swimming topless-, and being attacked by some unseen horror! How could this possibly be boring? I don't know, but it certainly is! Back on the boat, another young lass has shed her top, adding to the suspense. It doesn't help one bit, that there's not one likable character in the entire cast. Not one! Thankfully, there are zombies available to kill them! It's too bad that the living dead are so totally non-threatening / ludicrous. The alleged ""rave"" must go on, even though no one is on the island, when our heroes arrive! This small inconvenience won't stop them from acting like idiots! Only bloody mutilation could do that. Alas, in this movie, even this is dull. It doesn't help that between scenes, shots from the video game are pasted in. It only serves to remind us that this movie is just a plot-less attempt to cash in on that game. Hell, I was addicted to the arcade version of HOTD! I can attest to the fact that the game had far more of an actual story. It was also FUN to play! Plus, it had some frightening moments, unlike this movie. One of the most heinous crimes committed by Director Uwe Boll in this film, is NOT showing the slaughter at the rave party. Instead, it's on a video, discovered by others, showing scant seconds of nothingness! Disjointed, bereft of scares, and made of pure cheeeze, Boll has almost single-handedly destroyed the zombie sub-genre! I love how almost every normal, average human citizen in this movie has some remarkable karate skills, or is an expert marksman! More of an action movie, it's astonishing how Boll makes it all so mundane and uninteresting. Annoying music blares, a dozen guns blast, regular people become tough-as-nails instantly, and zombies blow up like water balloons, since that's what zombie movies are all about, I guess. I didn't even mention the grenades! Horrid beyond belief! If Michael Jackson's THRILLER video had had lots of guns and karate in it, we could have been spared this disaster! As for the HOUSE itself, after being shown for two seconds near the beginning, it stays hidden until almost the end! If you're a fan of the original video game, do yourself a favor and go play it. This mess will only depress you...",1499472000,,2739,4.661157024793388

1959104,4,B0000YEE6C,"As bad movies go, this is a good one. It never takes itself seriously, and there's plenty of guilty pleasures throughout. So if your looking for a zombie slaughter fest, with both action and a decent amount of skin, this will fit the bill.",1499299200,,239,4.454545454545454
1959105,1,B0000YEE6C,"A notoriously bad ""video game movie."" It's my first time seeing it and it's pretty much what I thought it would be, although there were a few surprises. The whole movie feels like it's from 1998 instead of 2003, its just laughably dated. The acting and effects are hilariously bad, the music is painfully terrible. One thing I found really unbelievably awful is how there's footage from the video game randomly spliced in, as if to remind us that yes, this is indeed a movie based on House of the Dead.

 So what's good about this train wreck? Well not much. There is a lot of action and gore which is nice since a lot of movies based on games skimp out on that. And it's also in the category of ""so bad that it's funny."" You will more than likely laugh out loud at the many unintentionally funny moments.

1959118,1,B0000YEE6C,"Based on the videogame of the same name, ""House of the Dead"" is one of the most charmless, noxious, and boring films in the entire zombie genre, and that is seriously saying something. If you are a fan of the Sega game, you're in luck: there are tons of references to it both large and small (I wonder why there is a huge ""Sega"" banner onstage at the rave?) These references get less and less subtle as time progresses and ultimately use footage of the actual videogame graphics to link scenes. To say this is a jarring and annoying technique is a gross understatement. But perhaps I am getting ahead of myself.

Produced by fourteen (!) producers of different ranks, including Associate Producer Max Wanko, the film stars a bunch of nobodys with no inherent acting abilities detectible among them. The exception to this is Captain Kirk (yes, really) played by the genuinely talented Jrgen Prochnow: it pained my heart seeing this veteran of ""Das Boot"" in something this embarrassing. He does his best with the material presented to him, but it's beyond hope. Under no circumstance should you consider this a proud reprise in a seafaring role. Also onboard as creepy First Mate Salish is B-movie veteran Clint Howard who earns his paycheck with some overacting that fits right in. The only other actress who comes close to pulling her weight is Ellie Cornell as Casper, a pretty cop with an apparently complicated and pointless backstory with Kirk, and who is the only reasonably likeable female in the film.

Some twentysomething college students show up on a dock to go to the island rave but they miss their boat. Resourcefully, they charter Kirk for a ride to the island for $1000. Their obvious financial acumen and lack of punctuality are not the only personality or judgment deficiencies you will notice among the cast. Rarely have I disliked a cast as much or as fast, and I couldn't wait to see them meet their fate and be done with it. Speaking of things to loathe, the music at the ""rave of the year"" is terrible, and the pungent combination of metal and rap is relentless through the balance of the film.

So the protagonists all get to the rave and find it's trashed and nobody's there. What to do? Be a bit concerned? Prudently leave? Drink and make out? You figure it out. Eventually three kids wander off and find a cemetery and an old house which seems much larger inside than outside. The best thing about wandering off into the woods is that the music is (temporarily) removed from your list of afflictions. When they get into the house they find two other kids who escaped from the rave after it was invaded by zombies. Not just any zombies, but black papier-mch zombies (or so it would appear) with red glowing eyes and an ability to push their hands clean through a collegiate torso in the most boring and uninteresting (not to mention cheesy) way imaginable. Only Kirk is able to defend himself with any degree of success, as he shoots the zombies with great frequency and accuracy while calmly smoking a Cuban cigar, as if this is a daily affair for him, though sadly he is ultimately bitten by a zombie and you know what that means.

I am going to interrupt my critique for a moment to mention one small positive of ""House of the Dead"" (and yes, I am a bit surprised myself). Uwe Boll does actually have talent, and that is manifested in some beautifully photographed and lighted scenes, predominantly in the woods. Intermittently beautifully shot (though still boring) scenes show he does have genuine cinematography skills, but then reality strikes back just as quickly with more horrendous video game graphic inserts.

Fortunately Kirk is a smuggler and he arms everyone with an amazing assortment of weaponry (including grenades) to do battle. If you are a fan of the first-person shooter videogame that spawned this movie, you might be thinking ""at last, action!"" Not so fast. I honestly don't know how this happened, but despite an amazing conflagration of guns and violence that lasts for just about ever, the gunplay and mayhem is staggeringly boring. It's just relentlessly dull. I had a hard time keeping my finger away from the fast forward button, and the metal music does not help this pass any faster. How can an action movie be this boring? The mind reels.

Of course everyone converges on the house and logic and continuity go completely out the window with a black and white movie within a movie about an ancient Spanish pirate-scientist who hijacked a Spanish galleon and did grisly experiments on the island. Confirming this is the discovery of his lab, which contains various body parts, and a microscope with a slide of blood conveniently in focus revealing blood that's not human, but that is ""completely mutated"". Right. Also there is an aquarium with a demon zombie fish, whose blood water can reanimate the dead, and, oh, never mind. You get it: it's all leading up to a finale and showdown that involves gunpowder (how convenient), a catacomb that is enhanced by oodles of videogame footage, the crazy ancient Spanish guy, and some last minute mistaken identity transformation garbage. The final battle in the cemetery is especially odious (who knew you could take a sword through the heart and still get up to fight back?) I won't ruin the incredibly painful helicopter rescue other than to say, can it please be over now?

Watching this film is a terrible experience. It's derivative (the meddling kids even mention ""Scooby Doo"" in the horrendously contrived dialogue), the acting is absolutely cringeworthy, much of the film is narrated and that narration is among the worst I've ever heard, the characters are caricatures and are essentially indistinguishable because nobody is a sympathetic person that you could care about, the soundtrack assaults you, the film is all over the place (Now we're at a rave! Now we're on a Spanish sailing ship!) and the references to the video game are incredibly forced, with the actual video game footage being hugely distracting for a film with a reasonable budget and a large crew.

Some movies are so bad they're good: this is not one of those movies. It's just bad, but worse than being just plain bad, is that it's unbearably boring, and I can't think of a harsher criticism to levy against a zombie movie with loads of ""action"". Avoid ""House of the Dead"" at all costs.",1446595200,,6365,4.774750227066304

1959121,1,B0000YEE6C,"House of the Dead (2003)
 Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard are both seasoned professional actors and infamous German film director and producer Uwe Boll somehow convinced the two to appear in small roles in his fist American movie (well, Canadian anyway.  It was filmed in Vancouver).  Boll had a budget of $12 million which is gigantic by Zombie movie standards, as we know.  Prochnow has had a long career and has done some very good work.  Howard is the elder brother of actor/director Ron Howard and also has a long career which began with some appealing work as a child actor.
 I suspect blackmail, how else could Boll involve such long time pros into his movie?
 The story line with House of the Dead has a familiar ring to it.  Some college kids set out for a party already in progress on one of the isolated islands in the Seattle area.  They hire a fishing boat captain (Prochnow) and his mate (Howard) to take them out.  The kids do not find the expected raging party and the somber mystery unfolds bit by bit.  Or Bite by Bite since the core of the mystery is a serious Zombie outbreak.
 The story has its origin in an old Sega video game and the director throws in clips from the game from time to time.  Imagine if you will a live action sequence with live actors running around trying to stay alive when all of a sudden you have a surprise visit from a Zombie cartoon.  Now imagine that happening 32 times.  Tiresome?  Tedious?  Is this a shameful stuffing of the film in the sad and chaotic tradition of Bride of the Monster and other epics from the camera of Ed Wood?  Hint, just because Ed Wood did something as a director doesnt mean that you should, Mr. Boll.
 There develops-or doesnt develop-a side plot about centuries old Spanish experiments that come to light as some kind of explanation for the Zombies.  Castillo, the centuries old Spaniard still lurks about causing trouble for the young party goers.
 The Zombies have good make-up which I liked but they occasionally use tools as weapons and often scoot around quickly.  I do not as a rule approve of quick scooting, tool using Zombies.  It is almost as if the level of difficulty had been notched up to make sure that no one can survive the game.  Uhh, I mean, the movie.
 Script writers Mark A. Altman went on to pen House of the Dead 2 and his partner in crime Dave Parker has such films to his credit as Bimbo Beach Bash.  You can be forgiven if you expect trite, insipid and non-sensible dialog.  You also get what you expect.
 The team of young actors displays no hint of future stardom.  We want more than stupid dialog poorly delivered from a film with such a monumental budget.
 As a director Boll likes to use the technique of spinning the camera through a full circle, to get the full circle effect I suppose.  Like the insertion of the video game clips, he over uses the trick.  In an ideal film, the direction is so competent and so smooth that we don't realize that it is even there-not with Boll.
 You can safely miss this badly made film and you might consider skipping Bolls entire body of work.  This film is so poorly scripted that the very life and continued existence of one of the surviving characters has to be explained at the very end of the movie by something that had never been mentioned until that moment.  Oh yaah, I forgot to say I cured her of death by giving her a shot when the audience was watching the other cast members killing Zombies.  Not that the character said that, but it was the sub text.  Awful.
 This is an R rated waste of time rather than a disgusting stimulus of the gag reflex so it gets a one and a half brain rating.  It runs one hour and 24 minutes.
 For a second opinion, Rotten Tomatoes listed House of the Dead among the 100 worst films made in the new century.  RT is a professional outfit and we need to take their opinion seriously.

Obviously, if you use something people love as a basis for a movie it would behoove you not to screw it up or tamper with it in such a way that it ridicules the very thing you're hoping to pull people in with........a game called House of the Dead.

This is not a really long commercial promoting said game; it's a zombie flick about 5 people desperate to get to a remote island in time to join a rave.  Judging it on those terms alone, it does exactly what you'd expect in a zombie flick.  People die and reanimate as zombies.  The people who aren't infected are desperate to remain so.  As luck or plotting would have it, an armed cop shows up and the captain of the boat that brought them to this island of doom just happens to have a small arsenal on hand.  A protracted fight sequence follows, allowing the remaining survivors to hang in the air as the camera spins around them.  None of this makes sense, but then neither does the casting of Clint Howard as brine soaked nitwit given to voicing warnings, portents, and dire predictions while dressed like a famous seafood spokesman.

Breasts are bared, which made it extremely difficult to tell them apart from the boobs who didn't know which way to turn.  They hold up in a spooky old house because nothing screams safety like a building surrounded by a cemetery.....and a zombie horde.

I didn't take offense to this movie as some have, mainly because I don't know the game affiliation and don't want to know it at this late date.  For me it was just another zombie flick.  It lost points for style, seeing as they were trying to please the fans of the game.  But I didn't mind it overall.  It pretty much accomplished what it set out to do.

 1. There is a scene that I call ""Zombie Slaughter Bullet Time"" where the survivors shoot & kill the zombies that I felt helped redeem the movie

I've seen all the George Romero zombie movies: Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead etc. I've also seen the Resident Evil movies but they are different than this one. Like Resident Evil, this one is also based on a famous video game. Most of the shooting scenes are in slow motion and they take you back to the game itself. It is as if you were playing the game yourself but in real life. It feels like that. Somewhere in the shooting scenes they will show a shooting scene of the game itself. This makes the movie different. It keeps reminding you of the actual game itself. The zombies here are more alive and faster as well. They are still dumb but they are a little faster and more active-- and they use weapons as well.  I would say the zombie makeup is not very impressive but it's still good. There is a lot of zooming in and camera angle rotations. This makes the zombies more scary by showing all their face features real closely. That's kind of cool. I would say the special features are good and the location as well. The environment suits and connects the movie with the game itself. It takes place in an island somewhere in the Caribbean.

1959145,1,B0000YEE6C,"I was recently discussing this pile of steaming garbage that Uwe Boll served up claiming it was a film. For those of you who aren't movie buffs let me first tell you a little about Uwe Boll. He's made himself famous taking video game franchises and turning them into commercial successes.

For those of you who knows what kind of garbage Uwe Boll creates you may be asking how I could say that. Well FINANCIALLY all of his films have made money. Look, I don't understand it either. What anyone who has seen ANY piece of one of Uwe Boll's films knows is that he also creates films that are unbearable to watch, taking OK to good actors and making them do a good job at quite possible ruining their careers. He also ruins any video game to film translation in the process.

It's amazing but because the financial portion always ends up solid he keeps getting franchises to mutilate. Let me tell you if I owned a successful gaming franchise I think I'd rather bite the bullet and not making extra money giving him the rights to film it out of pure pride for my work.

Still. This isn't about Mr. Boll but about his work.

As I was saying I had recently been talking about this film and he bet that not only could I NOT re-watch this film in it's entirety. (I did actually watch it through in 2004 and watched it again to create this review. Yes. I am either really brave or really stupid.) Not only could I not re-watch the film but I couldn't find one redeemable aspect to it.

Well with a horrible director do we have anything redeeming? Let's go through the list.

Acting? No. Only Ellie Cornell gave even a half assed performance and that was REALLY stretching it. I mean she did a decent job in Halloween 4 and 5. However she DID sign on for House of the Dead 2. Actually I can't say anything on that. I've never actually watched House of the Dead 2. I'm sure however it is that it has to be better then this one since Uwe didn't direct it but who knows. We'll see. Someday. When I get really desperate for something new to watch.

Special effects? ... hah... HAH..... AHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. Oh wow that brings tears to my eyes. So the zombie scenes mix between far out scenes of clearly poorly done zombies that morph into gameplay footage. We're not talking about a game that just came out. House of the Dead was by NO MEANS a new game when this was filmed and they still used the zombies from it IN THE MOVIE. I mean shit it looks horrible. The zombies they do show? Like I said poorly done and I believe there was a total of one almost decent headshot in the entire film. Which was ruined from being smack dab in the middle of a horrible action scene. They speed by the only decent looking headshot to instead show horrible shots panning around the actors shooting guns and mixed in with more of the game's graphics. Oh yes and the entire scene kept mixing in horrible slow motion that just looked wrong.

It's hurting my brain to remember how this was filmed.

So what's left. Plot? Well it was about a zombie infection that took place on an island in the middle of nowhere. Sounds exactly like it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME HIS COMPANY SPENT MONEY LICENSING. NOTHING. NOT A SINGLE THING. I mean the film has nothing to do with the video game aside from stealing it's name and 'special effects' which makes me wonder why they spent the money even getting it. Maybe the guys who owned the license at the time lost a bet.

So apparently a group of kids missed the last boat to this giant rave and pay someone off to take them. When they get to the island they have to then walk through the forest to get to the rave and when they arrive? No one is there. Quickly we realize though that the place is ruined and covered in blood. Only one of the cast members even gives a damn.  Shortly (it feels like 3 hours) after we finally get zombies coming in and attack the crew of the boat that took them out to the island. Fortunately for all involved said crew were smuggling weapons and the rest of the film turned into a cast vs zombie mess that want to get into a house in a graveyard which they've determined is the source of the undead. Clearly the best idea.

So my friend was wrong. I watched the film again. However he was also right as I can't say there was anything redeemable in the film. I mean we had a few nude shots in there for the male viewers and even those can't cast a shade on the lack of quality in this movie. I mean I remember they were there. I remember it was a raver chick. I can't remember anything past that aside from how horrible the movie is.

So. I can't even recommend this for a B-Movie night for those that enjoy them. This is a pile of trash and anyone who has to watch it surely will agree that it's creator should be flogged in the streets.",1349049600,,4782,4.2707182320441985

They have to cross waters and forest.  Hide in houses all as their numbers dwindle at each level.  The video game feel is actually refreshing but like all Boll adaptations it really is substandard.

3. Fold them into buisness money-types who want to go to a RAVE (hmmmm, but are suppose to be teens...scary)
4. Add in some story about a haunted island told by an old nerd who reminds me of that fat caveman from the 'Terrible Thunder Lizards.'
5. Put this all on an island that looks like it was suddenly desserted and has bloody clothes and such lying around it,but makes everyone feel okay/safe with it and want go off and have sex.
6. Add zombie-like creatures and a blah wooden house that never ends.
7. Mix in smuggled weapons.
8. Stir in repetitive dizzing wanna-be Matrix cinematography and a rap theme song
9. Bake for entire time of file with dumb lines, instant plots, limited explanations, lots of staring, a useless string of deaths, and flashbacks to the 18th Century.
10. Finally, top with swift justice, a soul survior, a predictable twist, and a bad ending speech that leaves opportunity for a sequel (please no).
Optional: nuts or throw in flashes of an old Sega Videogame this movie is based on at random times in the picture.

Plot:  As far as I saw this was a no plot zone.

This entire movie makes no sense!

Characters: Pathetic, pathetic, how he got the captain from Das Boot I'll never know.

Setting:  This movie has some many consistency errors in its locations it's not even worth pointing any out.  Oh, and we also get a nice rip-off moment of Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring somewhere in there to further anger viewers.

Effects:  Who could think mixing video game footage into a movie could work?  I'll tell you: Uwe Boll!

I enjoy bad movies for entertainment, I really do - give me a copy of Congo, or any of Ed Wood's films and I'm a happy man, but Uwe Boll is so inept that it is physically painful to sit through his travesties.

What makes it so great is that it feels like they were really trying to make a top notch horror flick, but just failed miserably.

I heard they released a version with a laugh track, but I attribute that to them trying to save some face (which makes it even better!). I don't understand how movies like Evil Dead (I love that too!) can have such a cult following, while this movie gets taken to the curb.

1959163,1,B0000YEE6C,"Uwe Boll is a director who pushes the boundaries, and makes viewers ask themselves serious questions. Specifically, he pushes the boundaries of just how wretched a movie can be, and makes viewers ask, ""Why is this guy allowed anywhere near a camera?""

""House of the Dead"" is the perfect example of this, as the first of Boll's still-going stream of video-game adaptations. Put simply, this movie is a perfect example of everything that is wrong in video-game adaptations, zombie movies, and trashy action movies in general. And despite the label, the funniest thing about this edition is that Boll thinks he can salvage this disaster.

A gang of twentysomethings are planning the Rave of the Century, and for some inexplicable reason, they decide to have it on a remote island called the Island of the Dead (ooh, foreshadowing! Subtle!). The boatman warns a gathering of eight young people that they are all utterly doomed, but when they show him the money, he takes them anyway.

But when they get to the rave site, they find that someone has wrecked it and is presumably lurking nearby -- and they find a mysterious house in the woods. Of course, they go inside. And then they are attacked by hordes of zombies, who are at the beck and call of an evil creature living in the House of the Dead -- an immortal conquistador. (Oooookaaayyyy....)

No, it doesn't make sense, and it never STARTS making sense. You know a movie is doomed when it doesn't make sense from the get-go. Why would they host a rave at a campsite... on a remote island... with only a few people? That's pretty brainless, even for a low-rent game-adaptation/zombie flick. But sadly, the illogic isn't the worst thing about it. Boll is.

To be honest, Boll could not have made a worse movie if he had tried. He inserts bits of the video game, seemingly at random, and tries to make up for the limp plot with lots of Matrixy slow-motion and spinning camerawork. If that doesn't make you sick to your stomach, the dialogue will: ""You did all this to become immortal. Why?"" ""To live forever!""

And the action scenes are the worst -- not a single fight looks real, and the zombies are distinctly unscary. At times it reminded me of King Arthur's fight with the dismembered, blood-spurty black knight... except Boll is utterly serious. He's also serious when he has our spoiled brats suddenly turn into hardened swordsmen, capable of defeating an ancient conquistador.

As for this edition, you know it must be a spectacularly worthless pile of tripe if the studio acknowledges that a horror movie can only work as supposedly ""sidesplitting"" comedy. Specifically, it would work as a full length episode for MT3K, with all the mockery they can muster.

Unfortunately putting out a mildly edited ""Funny version""/director's cut shows that they have no idea why the original was so funny -- it was because the people involved were all dead serious, and no amount of after-the-fact adjustments can change it into ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Dead Alive."" It apparently has different takes, cut dialogue, pop-up commentary, and even more footage spliced in from the original game -- which is like putting a band-aid over a bazooka-related injury.

Want a decent zombie movie? Try the wittier cult movies by people like Peter Jackson and Edgar Wright. ""House of the Dead"" isn't witty -- it's witless, from start to finish.",1220313600,,3374,4.813471502590674
1959164,1,B0000YEE6C,"I got a chance to catch this movie on its first DVD release, and I had high hopes, since at the time, Zombie movies had not taken off sprinting like they have since the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  It seemed like a great premise for a zombie film, strand a lot of college kids on an island, and then release the flesh eaters.  But the characters were mostly stock let's-get-stoned, -drunk, -screwed, whatever, and then let's get eaten and become zombies. The actions of the characters seemed so contrived, I felt compelled to see if Roger Corman had published another book, this one called, ""How I Made 100 Zombie Movies and Never Lost a Dime""). I'm not sure why they are releasing this movie a second time to DVD, as I found the first release more than enough to put me to sleep.

For very good zombie horror, watch any of the original Romero films, except for the very bland, unfrightening Land of the Dead.  Of course the remake of the Dawn of the Dead was incredibly well done.  And if you feel like squirming a bit more, try the movie Zombie (sometimes known as Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2, an homage to Romero's orignal Dawn of the Dead) for incredibly disgusting gut munching and claustraphopic feeling of being trapped on an island with the walking dead.",1219449600,2,1257,4.495614035087719

While it wasn't horrible, it certainly was one of the worst zombie movies ever made. But, it's not quite a zombie movie as it's based on a videogame based on zombie movies. So it's a subgenre of a genre. But I digress. This move most definitely has its moments; Clint Howard playing yet another creepy guy, the gentleman from Das Boat, cheese-tastic lines just begging for audience responses, and of course zombie gore. But for the good, there is also the bad; most of the cinematography looks to be that of a TV movie but it is only noticeable at times. The so-called rave happens during the day and the schizophrenic soundtrack gets annoying at times. This movie is defintely a sick-day movie, so while you can't watch it a lot, if you're home and sick and barely lucid, this one's for you.",1218240000,,1071,4.414141414141414
1959166,2,B0000YEE6C,"House of the Dead is a story of friends with intentions of going to the ""Rave of the Year"", but end up starring in one of the worst movies of all time.  If this movie wasn't specifically made for Mystery Science Theatre 3000 ridicule, then it was created with intentions of breaking the cinema scale of unintentional comedy.

Narrated by dim-witted protagonist Rudy, the friends fill out the cornucopia of stereotypical horror movie: Greg, the hormonally hyper best friend; Simon, the superficially idiotic third wheel; Cynthia, the blonde who serves as cannon fodder; Alicia, Rudy's ex-girlfriend who provides the unnecessary pointless love side-story; the Asian chick wearing a red, white, and blue spandex outfit (conveniently named Liberty); and a token black chick with a ROBOTIC.ACTING.DELIVERY.

The group is attempting to get to a remote island rave on Isla del Muerte, which translates loosely in Spanish to ""Site of the Lamest Rave ever"".  They hire a gun-smuggling German ship-captain named Captain Kirk - yeah, Cpt. Kirk - to take them to the isolated rave for $1000 on an island that will henceforth be named ""Thousand Island"".  Captain Kirk, and his first-mate (Clint Howard), take the group to the island, where previous scenes displayed a Sega-sponsored rave, where, naturally, there is at least one big-breasted Asian chick hired for some topless dancing.

In no time at all, a guy named Matt dies a deserved death for the travesty of wearing white penny loafers, and full-frontal, gratuitous nudity fills the time before the inevitable zombie attack wave.  It's also clear early on that horny kid = dead kid, and skinny dipper = dead kid.  Meanwhile, there are completely random and pointless insertions of video game footage - as if a viewer needed to be reminded about the inspiration for such insipid nonsense.

When the attack finally happens, the viewer quickly learns about the unique abilities of this island's zombies.  After Simon utters, ""Simon says"" - a phrase no person named Simon should ever say - he learns that some zombies can spit face-disfiguring acid roughly five feet.  Simon says, get that man some aloe vera!  Along with acid-spitters, there is a swarm of completely coordinate zombies that can climb, swim, and use weapons.  When the pop-out of the water during surprise attacks, the group engages in two compelling games of Whack-a-Mole, blasting each swim-team zombie as they surface.

The rest of the movie explores the hunting and killing abilities of the zombie axe-throwing gymnastic team (you have to see it to believe it), zombie track team, and Gallagher Zombie - a man who has fallen on hard times since the price of watermelon has skyrocketed - chase down the group, Cpt. Kirk, and a female shore patrol officer named Casper who has a magic pistol with unlimited ammo refills.

This is easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and there isn't a single second that goes by without the potential for unintentional comedy and MST3K fun.  Highly recommended!!",1215993600,4,3017,5.028112449799197
1959167,1,B0000YEE6C,"Five college students take an ill-fated trip to a remote island, endearingly called ""Isla del Muerte"". That's ""Island of the Dead"" for you non-Spanish speakers. They're expecting to take in a rave, but they get oh so much more than that. There be zombies on that thar island! That's about all the setup that you need, sadly it's not any more elaborate than that. And sadly, such a simple concept is convoluted by the fact that it's told as one big flashback with a bunch of flashbacks scattered throughout.

I was completely disappointed by the garbage script that was churned out. Completely abysmal. I wouldn't have been as disgruntled if I hadn't seen the writers' other work. I thought that Dave Parker's THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING was a much more inspired effort, and Mark Altman's screenplay of FREE ENTERPRISE was complete genius compared to this tripe. Some of the lines are complete head-shakers. Much like the boat captain's name, Captain ""Kirk"" (Jrgen Prochnow), the movie seems like it wants to be tongue-in-cheek, but Boll directs it completely straight. That's where it all unravels.

The action sequences would have been a positive for the film, but alas, Uwe Boll drops the ball again. If I see another bullet-time action sequence, it'll be too soon. The way it's callously thrown around, you'd think that Boll was the creator of the effect and this is the first time it's ever been seen or something. The main battle between humans and zombies is ruined by the insertion of distracting video game shots (which appear throughout the whole film) and the far too generous dose of slow-motion bullet-time. Every single character is granted a useless 360 degree slow-mo shot of them shooting off their weapon. It makes the transition from ""ridiculous"" to ""completely ridiculous"" when Rudy (Jonathan Cherry) takes a moment, in the middle of the carnage, to reflect on the events so far. The flashback is simply a super-fast collage of clips from the movie up to that point. I don't know about you, but the last thing that I'd do in the middle of a battle for my life would be to take time out to think about things. Utterly pointless and insulting. It's like we needed a refresher because we hadn't remembered what we've seen in the last 30 minutes.

This film should have never made it into the theaters, plain and simple. There's nothing redeemable, nothing original, nothing even fun. I can imagine Uwe Boll thinks he's very clever and his use of all the flashbacks was creative...it wasn't. He probably thinks his action scenes were mind-blowing with all the slow-mo and his camera tricks...they weren't. He, for some odd reason, thinks he can actually direct.

The movie is about a group of friends that go to a rave in an island by the name of 'Isla de la Muerte' (Island of Death). There, they encounter zombies, tons of zombies and start dropping one by one.

As I mentioned the director used a video game like approach, with images from the arcade game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-The-Dead/dp/B00003IEEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of The Dead</a>&nbsp;and whenever someone dies the screen revolves around the character and becomes red. The director also uses this revolving camera motion for the action and shooting scenes.  The soundtrack is pretty good (befitting of a rave), at least much better than the movie itself. The director uses a lot of slow motion techniques to show the bullets firing and some action sequences.

There are a lot of clichs in the movie: from ""there must be a scientific explanation"", a member of the group wearing the requisite goofy outfit with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix</a>-like' moves, stupidity, and of course the zombies. The people got tough fast, as soon as they were given weapons and instantly learned how to use them. ""Movie Rapid Learning Technique"": All for the sake of some action! I mean, these people are fighting like pros. And swords, let's not forget the swords or the machetes!

The movie also has 'Matrix-like scenes' downright to ripping off the moves. Throw in some old Spanish legend, some old newly found forgotten books and you have yourself what should be a sci-fi movie of the week. If you must watch it, watch it for the funny action sequence about an hour into the movie.

But for me, the saving grace of the movie is the gun battle on and around the boat and the assault on the island cabin that houses the mystery.  Or, the House of the Dead.

Seriously, any real fan of zombie horror has dreamed of getting a stack of weapons and unloading on an army of zombies.  This movie delivers that in spades!

A group of college kids go out to an island for a rave (sponsored by Sega, of all things), which is suddenly overwhelmed with zombies, forcing them to fight for their lives and walk around in slow motion. Uwe Boll comes from the school of direction that says the more special effects he can cram into a movie, the better. You'll notice that this philosophy has nothing to do with GOOD special effects, or even effects used at the appropriate time. Perish forbid the actors exhibit any emotion, either. There's a scene where a girl is turned into a zombie, tries to eat her friends and gets her head blown off, and her BOYFRIEND'S emotionless reply is simply, ""what was that?""

The fight scenes were also bad, the constant spinning camera around the actors had me convince that the camera must have been trapped in a small tornado. The zombies were also lacking in the make up department. Overall, a bad movie that is only good for laugh value. The movie just so cheesy, it's funny.

1959187,1,B0000YEE6C,"This film was my first true introduction to Hollywood's newest worst director, Uwe Boll.  The movie was bad. Not bad as in ""so bad it's good"", but bad as in pathetic.

If completely unnecessary nudity and expensive but poorly sequenced special effects are your bag, you will love it. But fear for your soul. If you were unfortunate enough to find this movie even remotely frightening and entertaining, please watch Evil Dead II. It will cleanse your palate and redeem your soul. For further proof of the difference between a good zombie flick and a bad one compare Undead, which is an Australian production made the very same year and with no doubt a much smaller budget even though it's a true tribute to the genre.

House of the Dead's plot sounds like fun but the execution of the story is an embarrassment and would even insult an ""audience of the dead"". Uwe Boll should not be directing comedy or horror, or camp. Band camp, horror camp or any other kind of camp for that matter. This is because he has no sense of humor and doesn't ""get it"" himself. So he can't convey anything worthwhile to an audience. The only thing he knows how to do is get his female cast to take their clothes off. The best horror flicks do not focus on nudity as a main event. They focus on the rules of how to die and how to stay alive. Nudity in the Friday the 13th series is art compared to the wanton displays in this film.  To show how much naked girls mean to him there is even a feature on the DVD titled ""The Sexy Babes of the House of the Dead"".

-Starts with lamenting fool who gives away the predictable ending.

-Poor credits

-Rave scenes and dumb kids playing in/around the water.

-Nitwits and their bimbos on a dock. They missed the boat to the ""super cool rave"" and just happen to have $1000 handy to buy a ride from two fisherman/smugglers.

-Arrival at the island and find the rave site deserted.

-Group splits up into a search party and a ""we'll stay here and have sex"" party.

-Find a shack in the middle of the island

-Killings of the nymphos

-Meet survivors, which brings the entire group to a nice stereotype gang (minus the goth element)

-Group decides to head back to the shore where the boat is

-Invasion of the boat by zombies

-Groups meets up with police woman (who was chasing the smugglers)

-Group reaches the shore and notices the zombies

-Group plays water sports with zombies

-Group splits into ""those who stick around the shore"" and ""the two who run off to find the other boat""

-Some kid gets zombie puke on him

-Moron dies, police woman heads back to the other group

-Group snatches the (oh so conveniently) smuggled weaponry

-Bad tale about how the zombies came to be

-Group decides it's a better to idea to go back to shack (which is a dumb idea because all it can do is eventually lead to being surrounded and eaten.....oh wait, that's a good thing!)

-Everyone in group instantaneously goes from moron/bimbo to crack shot or sharp shooter.

-Fight scenes with zombies (enter cheap matrix shots)

-Leftover group hides away in shack

-Group finds a weird lab

-Bimbo #2 shoots a tank and reanimates zombies

-Find a door that leads to a tunnel that leads to the shore (where they started out - ugggh!)

-Individuals offer to sacrifice themselves to the zombies while letting the others continue (would never happen!)

-Surviving pair is tricked by and meets head monster.

-Breif courtship of redhead and head monster

-Climax fight - I use the word ""climax"" loosely here, because it wasn't even a faked orgasm.

-Red head chic steps on head monster's head, thus brain oozing out

-Red head dies (aww boo hoo)

-Moron partially reanimates her

-Saved by other morons

-End credits

1959194,1,B0000YEE6C,"Uwe Boll is a director who pushes the boundaries, and makes viewers ask themselves serious questions. Specifically, he pushes the boundaries of just how wretched a movie can be, and makes viewers ask, ""Why is this guy allowed anywhere near a camera?""

""House of the Dead"" is the perfect example of this, as the first of Boll's still-going stream of video-game adaptations. Put simply, this movie is a perfect example of everything that is wrong in video-game adaptations, zombie movies, and trashy action movies in general.

A gang of twentysomethings are planning the Rave of the Century, and for some inexplicable reason, they decide to have it on a remote island called the Island of the Dead (ooh, foreshadowing! Subtle!). The boatman warns a gathering of eight young people that they are all utterly doomed, but when they show him the money, he takes them anyway.

But when they get to the rave site, they find that someone has wrecked it and is presumably lurking nearby -- and they find a mysterious house in the woods. Of course, they go inside. And then they are attacked by hordes of zombies, who are at the beck and call of an evil creature living in the House of the Dead -- an immortal conquistador. (Oooookaaayyyy....)

No, it doesn't make sense, and it never STARTS making sense. You know a movie is doomed when it doesn't make sense from the get-go. Why would they host a rave at a campsite... on a remote island... with only a few people? That's pretty brainless, even for a low-rent game-adaptation/zombie flick. But sadly, the illogic isn't the worst thing about it. Boll is.

To be honest, Boll could not have made a worse movie if he had tried. He inserts bits of the video game, seemingly at random, and tries to make up for the limp plot with lots of Matrixy slow-motion and spinning camerawork. If that doesn't make you sick to your stomach, the dialogue will: ""You did all this to become immortal. Why?"" ""To live forever!""

And the action scenes are the worst -- not a single fight looks real, and the zombies are distinctly unscary. At times it reminded me of King Arthur's fight with the dismembered, blood-spurty black knight... except Boll is utterly serious. He's also serious when he has our spoiled brats suddenly turn into hardened swordsmen, capable of defeating an ancient conquistador.

Want a decent zombie movie? Try the wittier cult movies by people like Peter Jackson and Edgar Wright. ""House of the Dead"" isn't witty -- it's witless, from start to finish.",1152057600,,2496,4.750577367205543

1959197,1,B0000YEE6C,"Uwe Boll is the German Ed Wood.  Wow.  This movie was spectacular!  From the very beginning, when we get the flashback intro and the clunky ""exposition"" that introduces the poorly-drawn meat (whoops, characters), you can tell this movie is going to be something special.  All of that exposition at the beginning is ultimately useless, because our surly band of rich and superficial young adults turn into hardcore swordfighters and gunfighters at the end of the movie, capable of out-swording an immortal conquistador.

Having missed the boat to the ""largest rave of the year,"" which appears to have had all of 40 extras in attendance, our spoiled youth bribe a decent actor to take them to the island where the rave is, while Clint Howard begs him not to.  I imagine Uwe Boll standing in front of Jurgen Prochnow with a stack of Benjamins doing the exact same thing, while Jurgen's agent desperately tries to stop him.

Upon arriving at the island, zombies attack.  OK, that's cool, because who doesn't like zombies?  Of course, Boll makes the key mistake of reminding us of other, better movies during his film.  (Don't do that again, Uwe!)  Oops, the island is home to an immortal Spanish conquistador who makes zombies.  There's some fighting, some bad dialogue, some questionable decision making by the only law enforcement person to show up, and massive overuse of bullet time.

At the end, we get overdosed on bullet time and on the spinning Cam of Vomit, which makes you a little queasy while at the same time providing no visual information or interest whatsoever.  There's some kung fu, some swordfighting, and some Monty Python-eqsue Black Knight type fighting.  I don't think we were supposed to be laughing when the headless guy's body starts attacking our heros, but it's darn funny.

Then, inexplicably, some FBI types show up on a chopper, do nothing, and we get a voiceover musing if this is the end, or (dum dum DUM) ""just the beginning""!

1959198,3,B0000YEE6C,"I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  At it's heart, it's an okay zombie flick.  Tons of boobs and blood, acting that ranges from average to ""I'm reading this off a cue card"", a story that was vaguely interesting, and a script that was crap, but not much worse than the average zombie flick.  The truly  hilarious part is the camera work and editing - it's as if someone let a group of hyperactive kindergartners loose in a room full of professional editing equipment, and five days later, this is the result.  Every camera gimmick you saw in the Matrix is repeated here, over and over, and over and over, and over and over again.  And then it's repeated a bunch more times.  For some reason, there's a flashback sequence in the middle of the movie where the last 30 minutes is run again in about 30 seconds.  Why?  Because Ewe Boll forgot he was making a movie and though he was working on an MTV video.  There are also hundreds of quick video game shots thrown in at random intervals.  They're actually kind of amusing.  This film could have been improved by removing about 3,000 edits from the final product, but did I mention it was edited by a group of hyperactive kindergartners flying on sugar and caffeine?

If you can laugh at the fact that the camera gimmicks completely overshadow the story on several occasions, this is actually an enjoyable film.  Okay, maybe you need to be able to laugh at the idiotic dialogue too, but THEN you can enjoy the film.

The frequent flashes of video game clips are damned irritating, and the shoot-out scene in the middle of the film is over-extended and over-done.

This is one giant craptacular commercial for a Sega game of the same name: House of the Dead.  Since Hollywood refuses to kill all its current writers and hire new ones, we are treated to Remakes of old classics, Sequels that should never be made (I'm still waiting for Titanic 2... don't disappoint me hollywood) and VIDEO GAMES being made into movies.  ::sigh::  The canadian bunch that made this mess and dragged poor Jurgen Pronchow and even Clint Howard into this should be dragged into the street and flogged.  First as the movie goes from scene to scene we are treated to video game clips of the actual SEGA game... as well as tons of SEGA placed ads.  (If this mess cost 7 million to make, SEGA put up 6 of it I'm sure.) If a character dies in the movie we are treated to a psuedo-matrix 360 degree spin and a cheesy red tint wipe effect, exactly like the game.  When Mortal Kombat came out as a movie, I actually saw it in the theatre.  It wasn't the best, but at least they didn't have giant ""FINISH HIM"" graphics or cut scenes from the game interspersed through out the movie.  I GET IT.  IT'S A GAME. NOW IT'S A MOVIE.  NOW YOU ARE SMOOSHING BOTH TOGETHER.  Let's continue down the list, the acting for all intents and purposes is flat, boring and uninspired.  I've seen worse, but nothing here made me care about the characters at all.  I take that back.  Sporting a laced up corset, Ona Grauer's character, Alicia, runs around most of the movie making sure her ample cleavage is visible and bust is swaying.  Indeed she is the sole redeeming special effect to this god awful trash.  The otherwise ham-fisted plot shoved down our throats in 2.5 minutes of dialogue. (1 minute from jurgen pronchow the other full minute from the head bad guy and 30 seconds from Ona Grauer stumbling across a book with all the other plot points, No doubt the cover read ""SCRIPT"" *smirk*)

Let's sum up.  The good: Ona Grauer's cans and it's less than 2 hours long.  The bad: under developed plot, poor dialogue, clunky execution, sound quality, sega ads, sega scene changes, wooden acting. I'm voluntarily giving this 1 star.  Which is actually a compliment.

I really was expecting to see a skinemax movie break out at any second, but alas, no gratuitous dry humping... only exploding heads and moss monsters running back and forth mercifully out of focus and barely in frame. The production team blew their proverbial wad on one fight scene that has about 30 examples of the worst execution of the now cliche Matrix roto-camera effect. In any *ahem* self respecting knock off, they would attempt to give the effect a little bit of justice with some sort of cool pose to capture, but in House of the Dead they bust it out on almost every shot in this one scene. I thought I caught a roto-action shot of one of the characters picking their nose. The rest were just ho-hum captures of the heroes walking through the graveyard popping caps in some really lame looking zombies, intercut with A-Team quality , zombie launching, explosions. Oh yeah, everybody becomes a blackbelt weapons expert in this scene after being a bunch of screaming, useless teens up until then. It is jaw-droppingly bad.

There's even the obligatory ""look at me, I'm a terrible movie with weak narrative,"" voiceover. The narrator tells you right at the beginning that none of the characters are likeable and that all of them will die. Gee... Smart way to start it off geniuses.  Tell us to hate the characters before we even get a chance to by seeing the dumb stuff they do. He pops up at other random times during the movie to throw in some more completely useless info.

I suspect that everybody who worked on this film was serious. This movie is so bad it's pathetic. It' likes watching Old Yeller get shot, seeing Litte Timmy drown in the well and finding out that the department store Santa is just a guy from Skid Row who was sobered up for the evening.

I won't get into the plot becuase there aint any but there's a  scene in it that's  so dumb it haunts me and is a perfect example of the whole film.  One of the ""teens"" (Why do teenagers in horror movies all look like they're on the wrong side of 30?) decides to fight the zombies with karate. Karate on the undead. Think about that.

I don't care if you studied for five years under  Pei Mei and David Carradine was your sensei, karate is not going to cut it when fighting zombies unless you're going to do the flying walk to safety thing. She gets eaten of course and one of her companions just stands there and looks. He has no reaction at all.  The actor plays the scene like he's at the beach.

Other moments that make me laugh are:  When the federal agent pulls an assault rifle out of Kirk's weapon box that is way too long to be in there, the kung-fu styling of Liberty, the lame matrix rip-off bullet time shots, and the zombie chuckling during the anti-climatic sword duel.

""House of the Dead"" may as well be called ""The Incredible Jumping Zombies."" If you like movies where zombie make soaring, incredible leaps like they have jetpacks attached to them, you are in so much luck.

Some of this stuff is so outrageous you figure it has to be intentional. For example, when one character is killed, the main character gets sad and has flashbacks on what he has gone through - except his flashbacks include scenes he wasn't present at! What the hell is that? Terrible.

And the dialogue. Seriously, check this out:

Alicia: ""You did all this to become immortal. Why?""

Castillo: ""To live forever!""

Simon: ""We got to the boat but it wasn't there.""

WOW.

1959219,1,B0000YEE6C,"I feel sorry for Uwe Boll. Everyone basically hates him for releasing

such garbage and ruining the videogames he takes off with (though is

""ruining"" the right term? This is, after all, House of the Dead...).

After watching the commentary on Alone in the Dark to hear what he had

to say for himself, I learned that Uwe Boll does not create such

terrible, terrible film out of a lack of caring or complete negligence,

he really does believe in every mis-cut one-dimensional broken piece of

action shot quipped with bad dialog he is responsible for.

This movie doesn't even need to have the commentary to feel this from

him. Immersed in all of it's terrible glory, one can still feel the

love Uwe Boll has from the camera as he misdirects scene after

horrible, horrible scene.

A rave is being held on the Isle del Muerte (and in this case Uwe Boll insults our intelligence again by actually having a character translate this to us: ""That means The Island of the Dead!""  He's the same character who states ""Sprechen Sie English?""  What a multilingual type!)  Some characters pay over a thousand dollars to get to this party (why?!?!?!), but when they get there, no one's around.  Irregardless, they go about dancing, drinking beer, sexing it up...  but despite their total lack of ability to do anything anybody normal would do, like wonder where everybody went or whatever, they get pulled into the action anyways.  Or whatever.

Rain falls on a boat but never on the island.  Day and night seem to come whenever it feels like it.  Zombies are scary by putting their hands on trees and flying.  The action is either akin to that movie your younger brother shot with his friends in the woods behind the house, or it's faux-Matrixy bullet-time.  There are boobs for no good reason whatsoever, and even more pathetically, men who are around those boobs who don't go anywhere with it because they're either insane (fisherman guy), idiotic (""I have to take a piss!"") or just wimps, (""No way, the water's too cold!"").  And mixed with it all is a lot of screenshots from the game, an idea that might have worked out if Boll didn't use it to transition between scenes randomly or whatever.

Good things this movie has, since it's appeal, action, continuity, editing, and dialog are terrible, are its allusions to other films... Romero gets a significant nod (what's a zombie movie without questioning whether Romero will come out with another zombie movie?), Scooby Doo, The Elephant Man, Lord of the Rings, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, they all get their respective shout-outs.

It's better than Alone in the Dark.  It had one scene that was at least fun to watch, the action one outside of house.  Too bad it takes too long, being that the terrible song that plays entirely through during it ends... and a new one begins.  But it was fun to watch.  The rest of it is rather exhausting, trying to keep up with it, trying not to vomit from the absurd dialog, trying not yell at the film for wasting your time...  Meh.

I could go on forever, but you have more reviews to read about it.  You know you read these reviews to hear the many various ways people hate this movie!  It's more entertaining than the movie itself.

For me to simply proclaim to the world that I thought this movie was bad would be an insult to bad cinema. Most of us look back on Ed Wood as one of the very worst directors who ever stepped behind a camera. Right now, I would have to say that Uwe Boll makes Wood look like Steven Spielberg! Poorly made and totally devoid of logic, good writing, and scares, this was a ""movie"" that never should have seen a theatrical release. How that happened is a mystery that will probably plague me for the rest of my natural life. I cannot begin to speculate how I would have reacted after paying my hard earned money to see this junk in a theater. Renting it free from the video store I used to work at was bad enough, because I still lost 90 minutes of my life that I'm never going to have again!

Somebody needs to put Boll in a paper bag and ship him away somewhere! He has no passion for what he does, no common sense, and he very obviously takes the vast majority of us fans out there for fools! To hear him prattle on about this movie in the special features portion of the DVD, you would think he had just filmed the second coming of Christ!

1959223,2,B0000YEE6C,"There are things in our world that were never meant for human eyes to behold nor human mind to fathom:

---the tentacled, slumbering horror that is Mighty Cthulhu, imprisoned dreaming beneath the sunken city of R'lyeh, sending nightmares of horror, madness and death to mortal men!

---the fearsome mutilations carried out by the Yeti-men of Yuzulak in the frozen reaches of Siberia!

---the gigantic, slobbering, galactically brilliant and monumentally psychotic denizens of the Martian canals, eternally crafting their tripod death machines and bent on ruling Earth!

---anything filmed by Teutonic Madman Herr Doktor Uwe Boll, who gave the world ""House of the Dead"", cinema's answer to Pol Pot!

First off, you've got to know something about the fiendish Herr Doktor Boll, so you can appreciate what you're in for. In a saner, God-fearing age, Uwe Boll would be quickly hauled before an Inquisitorial Tribunal, convicted of being a tool of the Evil One, and burned at the stake. In 21st century America, producers throw money at him to make movies like ""House of the Dead"" (and now ""Alone in the Dark"").

Smuggled out of Nazi Germany during the last days of the Third Reich, shipped to Argentina with a directive to obliterate Allied filmmaking as we know it, bankrolled by a trove of secret Nazi gold, Uwe Boll owns rights to every single videogame ever made (""Far Cry"", ""Hunter: the Reckoning"", ""Bloodrayne""---everything, kids, I'm sorry---Boll owns the rights to all of `em), and intends to make a movie out of every last one of them. A bad movie. A godawful movie that will make God in his Heaven cry, that may, in fact, even rip open a gate to Hell. A Legion of bad movies that look, sound, smell and taste like a**.

First understand this: ""House of the Dead"" (hereafter referred to as HoTD) is a cinematic cat turd, tossed in a blender, pureed, stuck in a microwave, and served to you, Gentle Viewer, piping hot, straight from Chef Boll's kitchen! Bon appetit!

HoTD dumps the following into the cauldron: a boatload of stupid (but nubile) teens; a super-secret island rave; a raving 19th century pirate, mad scientist, and flesh-eating liche big into gene-splicing; a horde of running and hopping flesh eating zombies; and a big Undead Tuff Shed. Seriously, the ""House"" is a shed. Only the greediest, most feverishly optimistic real estate agent would describe it as a House.

No matter. Teens get a ride to the island rave by way paying a wad of cash to Captain Victor Kirk (Captain Kirk---get it? get it?---played stoically to the end by Jurgen Prochnow) and his sidekick Salish (played horrifically by the Ice Cream Man himself, Clint Howard).

From there it's by the numbers: 1) Teens find rave deserted, 2)Teens split up, 3)Teens meet Zombies, 4) Teens get eaten and pooped out; 5) Surviving Teens turn into wire-fu machine-gun toting killing Machines.

The acting is uniformly awful, and comes in two flavors: 1) Good Sport 2)Bad Sport. Good Sport:The raver kids (Ona Grauer and Jon Cherry come to mind, since most of the raver kid actors just blend together) do what they have to do: spew projectile vomit that passes as HoTD's ""dialogue"", smooch while hordes of flesh-rending zombies close in---one kid worries about his good looks even as the zombies tear through the walls hankering for flesh.

Jurgen Prochnow is HoTD's Uber-Good Sport: he takes those zombies down with extreme prejudice and cigar-chomping dedication, courtesy of his laser-sighted assault rifle, spits out terse little quips, and smokes Cuban cigars furiously, all while tending to his zombie ravaged leg. Like Val Kilmer in the equally horrific ""Island of Dr. Moreau"", Jurgen, it seems, has had an epiphany---there's no way outta this thing, so might as well enjoy myself. And hey---the check cleared.

On the Bad Sport side, we had the two 'veteran' actors: Howard and Elie Cornell, who phone their performances in. Howard is so bad you're thrilled to see him die, but Cornell eventually grew on me, brutal death and all.

It takes true wicked genius, a strain of deranged brilliance, to make a movie as genuinely, astonishingly, consistently awful as HoTD. Boll doesn't just hobble his flick with incompetent acting, a brain-damaged script, and incoherent editing---oh no. At the very height of his action sequences, just when the movie is attempting to get some traction and draw the audience in, the rare seconds when HoTD actually works, Boll grafts in screen shots from the ""House of the Dead"" videogame.

No---really. Better still, pixellated screenshots. At the height of the action sequences.

Now, understand this: I *bought* the DVD for House of the Dead, having seen it---under the influence of much firewater---in the movie theater. Why? Because it takes iron nads to make a flick that s*cks this bad. Because in the nasty, brutal, merciless Desert of the Real, I don't get many laughs---and I hooted like a fool while watching HoTD. Because we don't have enough funny, and HoTD---whether Herr Doktor Boll intended it to be or not---is funny. No, really---it stinks so bad, so hard, so monstrously, that it's divinely hysterical.

Is it a nasty 100-car-pileup of a bad flick? Absolutely. Rubberneckers enjoy.

This movie is way ahead of its time; the appropriate time would be when I'm so senile that just planting me in front of a television and its flashing light puts a smile of my drooling face.

The House of the Dead, named for the `house music' played during the movie's pivotal rave party rather then after any architectural feature, is certainly the weakest of Clint Howard's one armed fishermen tales of the Pacific North West.

Some handsome bare breasts, yet a weak selection of off-the-rack firearms make this a difficult movie to reconcile or compare to other representatives of the zombie island film genre (with the notable exception of `Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island' of course). Instead, it would better to compare this cinematic gem with any random noun selected from the dictionary. ""Decorative molding"" wins out....

The digital special effects were quite impressive; for instance long dead and gifted actor Jurgen Prochnow was added digitally in the otherwise uncastable role of Captain Kirk, the fifteen hundred dollar ferryman to the stars. The visual transition from movie to video game - to staring at the ceiling of the theater wishing it would all end was seamless; and should also really warrant some special technical consideration.",1125100800,2,1276,5.061904761904762

I was so confused at first, because I swear I was watching Jrgen Prochnow one of the greatest German actors trading lines with the king of all cheesy cameos, Opie Cunningham's brother, Clint Howard!! My eyes weren't deceiving me, it was Jrgen he must have really bumped his head on the door of his submarine to be coaxed into doing this. The whole premise behind this trash heap was a rave that takes place on an island ""isle de los mort"" which I am pretty sure has dinosaurs on it, anyway, all these ""kids"" who looked suspiciously in their late late 20's, converge on the island to drink beer and dance (although I have never seen a ""rave"" that looked like that in my life). When I saw the Asian chick in the stars and stripes I thought that ""Fook me"" from Austin powers had made a cameo. During the rave Zombies come and massacre the whole lot, therefore creating more zombies I guess. All I knew was that there were about 3 sets of boobs (one set of which had the smallest nips I have ever seen in my life), and it seemed the zombies all shared the same baldheaded mask that I saw on sale during the post Halloween sale at Spencer's .It was obvious the budget was akin to maybe a UPN or even a bad VH1 spoof commercial. There was no point to this movie at all, the plot? A Spaniard mad scientist who wanted to live forever, he created a virus? Potion? New sports drink? To reanimate corpses to keep him company in that haunted pirate house? Throughout the whole movie was flashes from the video game which was completely unnecessary. The major giant fight scene between the zombies and the remaining kids plus captain Jrgen and Casper the friendly cop, lasted about 25 minutes I swear. The director had a brainstorm that sounded something like this ""lets take each person, with their weapon, set up cameras matrix style and slow mo them shooting zombies, that way we can extend the movie about 25 minutes and use up all the money meant for the effects makeup because who needs that?"" And in the end? The bad guy, Mr. FrankenScarface Spaniard dies because someone chops off his head and squishes it, now why didn't anyone think of that when they were trying to kill him centuries ago?

There's a little know fact about this flick:  the entire behind-the-camera crew was made up completely of six-year olds.  And these wunderkind pretty much deliver what you'd expect:  crap acting, a crap script, crap special effects(i just love seeing the jump pads that throw stuntmen actually on screen during the film).  This movie is so crappy, the only thing they didn't do was wipe feces on the camera lens.

Also, the best line in the movie(and my personal favorite part of the entire flick)is at the end when the lame-o hero comes face-to-face with the king zombie.  It is probably the worst bit of dialogue ever filmed.  Here's more-or-less how it goes:

LAME-O HERO:  Why do you want to be immortal?
KING ZOMBIE:  So I can live forever.

Doesn't the fact that the king zombie wants to be immortal make it pretty obvious that its because he wants to live forever?  Well apparently not to the lame-o hero or to the makers of this crapfest.  With stuff like this, how did this film not win an Oscar?  Pathetic.

The only decent thing in the film is the long shootout during about the middlepoint of the film.  The regular crew must have taken the day off and some people that weren't mentally challenged came in and shot it.  Its actually a pretty good scene.  Too bad that it can't make up for the pure putridness of the rest of the film.

'House Of The Dead' is a pure crapfest, directed by probably the crappiest director ever, Uwe Boll(check out his equally stinky 'Alone In The Dark' for confirmation of his unequaled crappiness).  But I have to recommend it just so you can see the high-level ineptitude and sheer laziness that went into making it.  It is truly a feat to behold.",1116806400,4,1904,4.5816023738872405
1959234,1,B0000YEE6C,"I think that if someone would've written this script and handed it to Ed Wood back in the 50's, he could've made this movie better by making the lead character a transvestite.  There is no reason anyone should see this, not even out of curiosity.  Certainly not just because you like the video game either.  What a stupid choice to make a movie out of a video game.  A shooter?  Did I miss something?  Doesn't the game have almost no storyline that is comprehendible and the worst voice acting of all time?  Not to mention all you do is point a gun at the screen and shoot things.  IDEA:  ""Let's make a movie about some people from a video game that shoot zombies, but instead we'll just bring them in at the end and force audiences to watch a bunch of people they don't care about shoot zombies on an island"".  Why are they going to this island?  Answer:  To go to a rave party...

Who did they pay to take them there?  Answer:  Jurgen Prochnow.

Why is this a waste of time?  Answer:  Because Ed Wood could have made it better.  (I am not kidding.)",1116115200,,1050,4.26530612244898
1959235,1,B0000YEE6C,"To describe how awful this film really is, you have to invent a new adjective or two.  'Bad' is not enough; 'Terrible' is too kind; my choice is 'Atrocious' which I am afraid is not strong enough to fully convey the truths about the wretched film and my miserable feelings after watching it.

Yet another TV-game based film that does not know what it wants to do, 'House of the Dead' shows the bloody battles between the zombies and the teenagers, plus a few middle-aged actors who should have read the script before singing on.  Anyway, the plot is just a standard one, about the five young Americans who join in the secret party held on an isolated island, as you see a wild party going on, which is apparently sponsored by SEGA Company, who provided the zombie-hunting game, basis of this film.

[NO IMAGINATION AT ALL]  There is nothing new or innovative about this Agatha Christie-meets-Down of the Dead story, but that's OK with me.  More damaging thing about 'House of the Dead' is that the film director Uwe Boll seems to have no sense of storytelling, thrills (cheap ones or not), or even humor.  The film freewheels exactly like a TV game you're watching over someone else's shoulders, and as if we don't know its origin, Uwe Boll repeatedly inserts the cuts from the TV games between the film's action scenes, reminding us of the fact that after more than 10 years, some film producers are no wiser than when they were making 'Super Mario Brothers.'

But most shocking part is the inclusion of Clint Howard and Jurgen Prochnow, both having been in more respectable films in the past.  Prochnow even allows one character to make fun of his being in 'Das Boot,' a parody that he should have refused.  The bad acting from the younger actors are no help, and many of the dialogues are so laughable that you can sample and remix them in a hip-hop style and enjoy yourself listening to them.

To me, however, the most incredible thing is, Uwe Boll continues to make films after this debacle, and underwent another bigger debacle with 'Alone in the Dark.'  Compared with these, 'The Tomb Raider' starts to look like 'Star Wars.'",1115424000,,2132,4.64095744680851
