8162010,3,B000LKLW3I,"This is an odd little comedy about what happens to two friends when one inherits a large family estate in England. Directed by Jerry Lewis and starring Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford , this is kind of a ""post Rat Pack"" adventure which has a few unique touches. Classic horror fans will get a kick out of cameos by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing as their most famous characters.",1484438400,,383,4.485714285714286

But for you young folk out there a frikin great movie directed by the great Jerry Lewis "" hey lady"" the only film he directed he was not in himself.",1359849600,2,376,3.4352941176470586
8162015,1,B000LKLW3I,"Misguided sequel to the moderately successful ""Salt & Pepper"" finds Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. emulating Martin and Lewis. Not surprising, since the painfully unfunny farce was directed by Jerry Lewis (who doesn't even appear in a cameo). ""One More Time"" (1970) has been largely forgotten, but admirers of Lewis as Filmmaker will want to study his rich color scheme. Jerry, Sammy and Peter had a blast making this movie  a pity that the fun rarely emerged on screen.",1347667200,2,473,4.9125
8162016,3,B000LKLW3I,"Not a bad sequal ,not bad at all, Sammy davis jr Peter lawford throw Jerry lewis into the mix, and you have....comdedy?? sort of, Sammy davis jr doe's his best Jerry lewis inpersination to date and peter lawford kills as 2 characters,thats 2!! its good clean well paced fun,sort of,",1292198400,2,282,4.66
