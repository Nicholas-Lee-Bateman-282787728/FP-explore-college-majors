8475151,2,B005IWG55Y,"Apparently the 'studio' that produced this movie desperately wanted their own Rocky Horror Picture Show or Toxic Avenger -  they made at least 18 movies. None of them ever got ANY review on Rotten Tomatoes. This was claimed to be a satirical homage to 80's revenge flicks but I'll never know.

I took a look only because the title had the word ""Moist"" in it and a relative of mine hates that word quite a bit. I sent a screen shot of the title image to them. Their reaction was as expected so I watched the first couple of minutes to see what other gems of revulsion I could find to share.

As it turned out Ricky Gervais and Howard Stern, both known for pushing the envelope of good taste, would have both likely switched it off after about a minute. Although over the top and gross out comedy is something I enjoy, this studio pretty much missed the mark 100% of the time in just the 2 minutes I watched. At that point the intro credits started rolling and I found I couldn't continue to listen to awkward cursing, wooden delivery, over-the-top overacting - yeah overacting that was too 'over'. Hmmm, maybe I should have just turned the volume down, put on some tunes and drank a beer.
It get 2 stars because 1 star is for haters and I just didn't like it.",1522886400,,1258,4.3446808510638295
8475152,3,B005IWG55Y,"Alright, this is an unashamedly bad movie. I am just getting to know LBP but they make me laugh a little.

This has dialog written by a 4th grader that grew up around kids who had sailors for parents. The story line is a mish mash of 70s and 80s revenge and wasteland films with some bad Anime plot twists mingled in.

So inside you will find the word lesbian a lot, excessive cussing, wrestling outfits that are sometimes kind of sexy... in fact wrestling is a stretch they are far more like garage sale costumes assembled to kind of look wrestling, lots of school ground sex jokes, and very clunky dialog.

The downsides are too numerous to count. No nudity. Fake dongs. No real attempts at gore during the occasional fake blood eruption. Jokes that only sort of hit the mark part of the time.

I really suggest watching before you buy or rent. Unless you are a true supporter of low budget trash you can only leave this transaction feeling cheated.",1521936000,,951,4.479768786127168
8475153,4,B005IWG55Y,"LBP. Love their movies. Not all of them are good, but most of the are fun to watch. So, if you like Filthy McNasty, Film Crew or Wet Heat, you should enjoy this one.",1379203200,,165,3.8823529411764706
8475154,1,B005IWG55Y,it had very bad acting and anyone watching can tell the actors and production were ment to be cartoonish and the cover and DVD leaves the veiwer to beleive that there will be strong adult material but it is misleading because the acting is of that as a fouth grade play.,1347148800,,270,4.313725490196078
8475155,5,B005IWG55Y,"If you know Low Budget Pictures, you know what you are getting into.  Cheese abounds, and it is nice.  Loved this one from the LBP crew.",1334361600,,136,4.1923076923076925
