4664806,5,B005E7SEM0,"There were two versions of The Trip--a six-episode television series and a condensed theatrical version. I've not seen the one released at cinemas--I suspect something this subtle and uneventful wouldn't work on the big screen. The TV show is super-subtle, very clever, and very funny. It's not meant to be hilarious, so don't go looking for The Office-type laughs. This had an added dimension of pathos--it plays with Steve Coogan's persona, and it makes him out to be much deeper and sadder than we might imagine him to be. There's no way we can work out just how much of the real Coogan is in this character--and that's the point. It plays with reality and our expectations. Both Coogan and Bryson are excellent, as is the directing by Michael Winterbottom. This series doesn't seem very well-known, but it's worth tracking down.",1312588800,5,832,4.907801418439717

4664809,5,B005E7SEM0,"Feb, 2017: To each his own- I read other reviews, ranging from ""hilarious"" to ""mean-spirited"".  I haven't seen other of these blokes' offerings (except Coogan's hapless director in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001O6W9QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) and don't know their routines but found it alternately clever, funny, touching and bittersweet.  I found it absorbing from beginning to end, and thought the character development incisive, inspired.  *** SPOILER ALERT***  My husband was a Yorkshireman and he and his good friend from the east end of London often bantered this way, including impressions (Michael Caine at the top of the list, marvelous).  In The Trip Steve has seeming ego and intimacy problems, is less than comfortable with himself, and though he treats his friend Rob quite shabbily at times, the latter takes little offense, happy enough to play Rhoda to his mate's querulous Mary.  Beneath the humor, the wonderful Yorkshire scenery and the changing restaurants and locales is an undercurrent of pathos, of existential angst.  It reminded me very much of Christopher Guest's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Tree/dp/B00FWPML0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Tree</a>&nbsp;(though the latter's tongue in cheek, more a parody).

Anyway there's not a lot of action in The Trip but there's loads of conversation, character development and charisma between the two leads.  Loved it.

Update: I've since become a fan of Coogan's, after seeing the absurd&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alan-Partridge/dp/B00IOH83AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alan Partridge</a>&nbsp;and especially,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philomena/dp/B00IGI3LMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philomena</a>.  In reading about the true story behind Philomena, I learned that the reporter Coogan plays in the film, Martin Sixsmith, purportedly embellished the story and added unsavory, gratuitous elements in writing the book  This, according to people interviewed by Sixsmith.  Coogan optioned the book, co-wrote the screenplay and produced the film, and CLASS ACT that he is, did so with respect for everyone involved.  He ignored the sensational, cheesy elements of the story and instead focused on the relationship between Sixsmith and Philomena (it was a photograph of the two together in the newspaper that instantly drew him in).  I couldn't have been more impressed with the film's subtlety, pathos, and inherent compassion for human beings, flawed though they are.  The Trip bears the same subtle Coogan nuances as Philomena- utterly natural in the way real relationships are, in the details, and simply wonderful.  I've since watched The Trip several times and see more and appreciate it more with each viewing.  Highest recommendation.",1507507200,,3372,6.985714285714286

The improvisations, impressions of actors ( Michael Cane, Sean Connery), creation of roles, enacted  on the spot, are priceless.  A great example is Rob's thought of doing a costume drama. Steve jumps in, agreeing it would be grand to do a costume drama in the hills. He then proclaims, "" Gentlemen to bed for we leave at first light. ""  This one phrase ignites them, launching them into theme and endless wacky variations.  Throughout, they let loose in such a wildly unfettered way that likely only a very good director ( Michael Winterbottom) could contain them at all. They do a winning duet of The Winner Takes it All, but one of the most hilarious moments is the pair's spontaneous rendering of a Bach fugue in the brilliantly high ranging Swingle Sisters' jazz style.

4664833,5,B005E7SEM0,"Spouse and I watched this one night and then The Trip to Italy the following night.  ""The Trip"" is superior, probably at least in part because the novelty and originality of the two ""characters' "" (Coogan and Brydon) banter and dialogue is delightful but it's subdued, somewhat predictable and darker in ""The Trip to Italy.""  We both loved ""The Trip"" though and laughed out loud often because Coogan and Brydon are hilarious, very talented and so engaging with the movie and literary references. The travel scenery is also wonderful. In the film, Coogan is divorced with children and Brydon is married with a child. Coogan has several ""liaisons"" with women they meet along the way, but there is not explicit sexual material shown. Brydon is a faithful husband who calls home, misses his wife while away from home and is of apparently different ""character"" than Coogan's. In ""The Trip to Italy"", which is far less funny and rather sad at times, it became disappointing and kind of veered into a more sordid theme as Brydon shows a different kind of character than in the first trip when it comes to encounters with women.

4664848,4,B005E7SEM0,"I love ""Road Trip"" movies (e.g., The Darjeeling Limited, Sideways, The Way) and this ranks among (or should I say amongst) the very best. Amidst all the humour (going Full British here) is some definite pathos. Steve Coogan's character is mercilessly stripped of all illusion as the journey progresses (for instance, the pathetic series of one night stands that inevitably end with his partner silently leaving, or his increasingly futile telephone calls to his supposed girlfriend in America) while Rob Brydon gets more and more of our sympathy... and eventually, our downright admiration.

Having traveled extensively around England myself, I can vouch for the literal accuracy of the roads, lodgings, and restaurants featured in this movie. Yes, this is what a road trip in the North Country is like. The scene with the Full English breakfast almost made me book a flight to the UK then and there, it made me want just one more so bad!

No spoiler here, but the ending absolutely cries out for a sequel. I'm glad there actually is one, and I can't wait to see it. (I've ordered it already.)

4664862,3,B005E7SEM0,"""Two Men in a Box: -- if you are familiar with Rob Brydon and his apparently popular bit: ""Man in a box"", then you understand the most obvious allusion in my reference (otherwise, don't worry, the film will soon explain it). Sorry to say, my meaning gets darker further down my review.

Others have already rehashed the plot (a road trip lasting 7 days), so go read them. The following is my impressions of these two characters and the movie made around them. But are they only characters? I can only assume Steve and Rob are playing themselves.

Both characters are witty, charming, agile of thought, and certainly broadly educated. Very familiar with both classic and pop cultures. Who wouldn't want to spend a week with either one of them engaged in charmed conversation and expensive, fussy gourmet food?

I wouldn't. After one day I would be taking the bus home. Two men in a box. Here, a box made of their self-absorption, narcissism. One wonders if either has any authentic feelings, any passion or commitment to anything (other than to their careers). They devote most of japes to mocking other actors (doing impressions), mocking the food, or cutting each other down. What I miss most of all is something original: some authentic original insight or emotional reaction to what is around them or to each other. Essentially their conversation is derivative: it references the work of others, if only to mock and dismiss it (in order to show their own superiority??). In that lies a deep cynicism. I can't forget to point out Rob's special""gift"" to the conversations. That is his mania for serial impressions. They are very clever and accurate. But they also relieve him from ever having to utter an honest emotion or an original thought, or authentically responding to Steve, to Steve's parents, or even his wife at home.

Both seem to acknowledge their cynicism. One scene in the movie has these two singing a song of some (to me unknown) a cappella group and Steve wistfully praises them for joyful, non-cynical style. At these moments the movie has an authenticity that shines as it (brutally) reveals the shallowness of these two. Someone, the director or the film editor/cutter, deserves 5 stars for creating such revealing portraits.

How brutal? Steve is missing his long-standing girlfriend, who has left to do work in the USA for an indefinite amount of time. While Steve says he misses her, it soon becomes apparent that the two actually have little to say to each other. A split view of the phone call shows how frustrated the woman is for it is obvious, so obvious as to be beyond words, how utterly over the relationship is. Yet, although Steve feels himself heartbroken, that doesn't stop him from bedding waitress at (at least) two of the inns. And each time the movie shows the woman leaving the room silently, alone, while Steve feigns sleep in bed. Steve's need for intimacy/connectedness stops with physical contact without extending itself in interest to the person of the woman involved.  Brutally honest! The girlfriend (in the USA) gives voice to her suspicion that these dalliances of Steve's are already occurring, which suggests to me this is serial behavior for Steve. Along the lines of ""showing friendship"" by putting each other down, Steve and Rob instigate trivial competitions with each other to see who is better, or smarter. You will want to look at the ""octave test"" scene for example of this, and Rob's celebration at the end as winner. Perhaps the low point in the movie is, while Steve & Rob stand in a graveyard, Steve improvises an eulogy in behalf of Rob, a rather dismal portrait of his friend. Or maybe it's a high point, as it appears that Steve sees Rob rather clearly.

Here is another source of creative tension in the movie that kept my attention. Both men are obviously intelligent, aware, even self-aware. Both this awareness is somehow stuck, captive, and so they remain in their own personal self-absorption. Fitting it is that several times both break out singing together the Abba song: The Winner Takes It All. Listen to it on youtube: it's a fun, it's catchy pop; it's also full of maudlin self-pity. Inspiration by the director or authentic, ""natural"" choice by these two during filming?

To be sure, in some way, in the last 8 minutes of the movie, the viewer senses some authentic emotion between the two, but it's unstated, only implied. And when Rob returns to his family, one can see that the Rob is the more capable of true feeling toward his wife and new-born baby. (Or is that just the thrill of newly being a father. Will that wear off in time? Reader alert: this is mere speculation on my part.) Although Rob also continues with the impressions to express himself.

The movie ends with Steve alone, absolutely alone in his apartment. While the beauty of London (?) glows outside, he remains cut off from it all.

Steve Coogan and his friend Rob Brydon travel across the north of England, sampling food from top restaurants as part of a piece for a London paper.  Since Steves girlfriend Mischa is in the U.S., Steve asks Rob to join him.  (Steve will be known to American audiences from his lead role in Philomena; both Steve and Rob appeared in the wonderful Cock and Bull story that (remarkably) turned Sternes novel, Tristram Shandy, into a film.

Both Steve and Rob are both comic actors and impressionists.  Throughout the film they do impressions of famous actors.  Their Michael Caine is brilliant.  Ditto the Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Dustin Hoffman, and Anthony Hopkins.  The Woody Allen is slightly off the mark.

The actors are more or less playing themselves, with some dramatic touches and inflections.  Steve strays from his intentions to be sexually faithful to Mischa (though they are on hiatus); Rob sweetly calls his wife each evening, sometimes for comic phone sex.

The fooddominated by scallops, which must have been very special at this time for the chefsis presented very seriously and we see more of its preparation in the subsidiary material on the dvd.  There is also additional material on wine tasting.

The tone throughout is warm, comic, and bittersweet with touches of male oneupsmanship with an underlying affection.  These are very talented and clever men.

The Trip to Italythe sequelis equally strong, with more sunshine and more pasta.  The driving is equally lovely in the countryside and equally crazy/hectic in urban areas.

I found this documentary style film to be a neat video to experience...  as usual with British Shows, it tends to be a bit more cerebral than American slapstick or situation comedies, it also tends to make one introspective on a deeper level than other American shows do... I mean, do you ever find yourself wondering what it would actually be Like to Live With or Live AS Kramer from Seinfeld, or do you just goof at his antics?

This show far more delves into the reality of larger than life personalities, be they famous film stars, or comedic entertainers...  it speaks to what we each look For in our personal relationships as well as the brutal realities that Actually comprise our real relationships...  be they quick dates and one offs that make us miss something more, or the tedium of predictable relationships that make us sad for the novelty of new experiences...  A brutally sober (figuratively) and proper view of the world around us, or an ability to find and Make fun Anywhere about Anything...

Each of the two characters, I feel, tends to try and pull the personality of their counterpart closer to what they themselves feel is the ideal, while exposing in the meantime that neither of them really enjoy the 'purity' of experience they hold so strongly against the other's personality...  And again, the ideal 'road trip' 'buddy movie' idea ultimately is Never made of the moments films lie to us as being made of... instead, they are the usual moments of good experience within the common drudgery of everyday reality...
Perhaps a bit too real for escapist cinema, but a far more real and meaningful story for all of that...

That being said, I would not recommend purchase outright unless you're a big fan already...  the one night rental would still make for a pleasant evening...  leaving us grateful for those around us, and more aware of our own realistic shortcomings...",1411516800,2,1975,4.748538011695906

 Two actors, playing themselves, take a roadtrip to Northern England. If you've ever spent time on the road with a good buddy then you know the weird, funny, annoying events that can and do take place. And somehow, we get to view it all; mostly all.

 I enjoyed this strange travelogue of Northern England. The countryside was beautiful; the food looked interesting, in a most non-English way; and I loved the addition of Michael Caine's voice doing battle with Michael Caine's voice, on this weirdly British magical mystery tour.

 I hear there are other ""Trips"" that were made over a period of years and I shall find them and view those also.

 Once again, I enjoyed this and my wife watched it with me AND she said she liked it too. She doesn't always like my cinema choices; no, quite often she doesn't. ;>)",1409788800,,971,4.637426900584796
4664918,3,B005E7SEM0,"Beautiful English countryside. Meandering roads through rolling hills dotted with sheep.
And Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon prattling on.
Coogan is ""tasked"" to travel about northern England and sample and critique the food at some of the finest restaurants for a magazine article. Coogan was to take his girlfriend (relationship hits the skids) and Steve takes his buddy, Rob, also a comedian.
They try and outdo each other when it comes to doing impressions...Michael Caine, Sean Connery, etc.
There's plenty of food porn. Gorgeous plates of three star meals. But food isn't the star.
It's Coogan and Brydon's improvisation. There's a very thin script. Most of the humor comes from the two rambling on, about each other or whatever comes into their head. It's ""My Dinner with Andre"" with Steve and Rob on the road.
Some of it is hilarious. Some of it goes on too long. That's the problem with improv. Know when to quit.
Steve comes off highly insecure, a bit dower, and moaning that his life hasn't progressed much from his television days as Alan Partridge. He's constantly calling his agent. Much like Paul Giamati in ""Sideways."" Like Giamati's character Miles, Steve is self-absorbed, bloviated, condescending, sarcastic...some aspects of his fictional character Partridge. He's certainly frustrated.
Meantime, Roby, married with a child, seems perfectly content. He's having a better time on this road trip than Steve.

The road trip humor between Coogan and Brydon was funny for a few minutes, but then it was more Animal House.  How many impersonations (both good and bad) of Michael Caine can be entertaining?  For this reviewer, a lot fewer than I was made to suffer through in this film.

Loved the scenery and the locations.  The foodie segments seemed a mix of awe and parody.  Perhaps intentional.  Had a recent journey to Keswick/Lake Windermeer and loved it, except for one day of pretty heavy rain that blotted out the beauty of the surroundings, which are extraordinary.  The Trip made everything look lovely, which, since it was shot in winter, is quite amazing.  Made us want to go back.

Coogan is funny, but here the humor is pretty sophomoric.  I'm still going to see Trip to Italy just because I'm sure they'll do a wonderful tour of Umbria or Tuscany which even when not perfect is pretty terrific. Final thought: it's for Anglophiles only.  You have to love English countryside and English architecture and the lilt of language and the funny juxtaposition of beautiful Polish ex-pats as they carve out a life (and some frolic with Steve) in the UK.

Roger Moore, Michael Caine and Al Pacino have all been impersonated for more screen time than they've actually ever been on film so the lack of current characters is a strain and, frankly, beyond the stellar Michael Caine take-off, many impressions weren't that great.

There's a close-to-transparently thin plot that fashions a fictitious version of Coogan as a washed-up B-list celebrity with lofty ambitions of Hollywood, which works to a point and uses his best self-deprecating talents but ultimately doesn't lead anywhere. There are 3 or 4 genuinely funny scenes and it's certainly not a format I've seen before, mixing dining, impersonating and travelling around British countryside. But what might have been a hilarious 43-minute TV special really starts to drag as a full-length feature, and it will also leave you feeling hungry.",1408406400,,1052,5.261904761904762

off each other like only two well connected comics could. Their interactions are priceless--mostly inane,
off-the-cuff conversations that are captured at the heart of their intense silliness.
Dont look for a whole lot of poignancy in this film, no powerful or moving conflict. In fact, there is little

Of course the main fascination ultimately has to do with how much of it is real? Were Brydon and Coogan playing versions of themselves, exaggerating aspects of their personalities/insecurities for comic or dramatic effect? For instance, the Michael Sheen discussion.

Two middle-aged British comedians tour Italy sampling the local food & women in this sequel to the cult BBC film / TV series The Trip.

Whats it REALLY about?

Edited-down best bits of a six-part BBC docu-comedy where The Observer commissioned comedian Rob Brydon to write restaurant reviews in Britains Lake District (series one) and Italy (this film/series two). Brydon invites fellow comedian Steve Coogan along, and we are served the best bits of their improvisations and  impersonations based on an EXTREMELY loose plot.

What did I think?

We are force-fed a game of one-upmanship (that starts off tedious and becomes painful) sandwiched between an excuse to follow in Byron-Shelleys footsteps across Italy, and the veiled excuse of truncated food-porn.

I won't lie: I laughed a couple of times at their James Bond / Godfather / Michael Caine impersonations.

There are behind the scenes in the kitchens accompanied by the exterior and interior views of the inns they stayed at.  There are side trips to local tourist haunts.  Meanwhile, the 2 different personalities are contrasted by their differing domestic lives, one stable and the other, chaotic, their 2 careers, one hugely successful and the other, still searching, and their common ground of humor/impersonations.

His girlfriend, Mischa, has cancelled on him and returned to America and Steve asks a friend (Rob Brydon) to go along with him. It is apparent at the outset that the two, Rob and Steve, don't know each other all that well with the implication that, perhaps, Steve doesn't have all that many close friends.

Playing themselves, Steve is the more famous one and seems to be a magnet for cute Northern waitresses and innkeepers but he is forever unsure of himself and misses Mischa. Rob, although apparently not achieving the acclaim of Steve, is happily married with a young child. They reveal vulnerabilities as they verbally spar and wrestle with their mid-life identities. At the end Steve returns to his luxury apartment, alone and Rob rejoins his family.

The scenery is wonderful and the food scenes are great. Some of the restaurants/locations showcased in the movie include:
L'Enclume in Cartmel

This movie and the characters were very well developed. I like that the impetus for 'the trip' was a food expedition, and that it was not the primary focus. It was a layer, the locations were another, the mains another, the adjunct characters another. It loved that Brydon and Coogan 'played themselves', and I loved the juxtaposition of their private lives -- Coogan's lonely to Brydon's fulfilled -- it added another element/layer to the story. And all in all, I found it very rich, meticulously woven and very well sorted out. Great find.

4665044,5,B005E7SEM0,"Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, two British comic actors in real life, go on a trip together to cover Steve's assignment as a food critic for the Observer. The restaurants they visit, housed at posh boutique hotels, were chosen by Steve's girlfriend, Mischa, who was supposed to go with him. But Mischa has moved to the States and Rob is the only person available at such short notice. ""I called others but they were busy,"" Steve tells Rob shamelessly when he calls to ask if he wants to go with him.

In that auspicious premise the trip begins; a trip that will take them from the congested freeways close to London to the solitary and tortuous roads of northern England.

The landscape they travel through is lovely, the hotels where they stay, lavish, and the food impossibly delicious looking. It is also too sophisticated for the two Englishmen whose faces only lit up in total surrender when the last day, their job completed, they share a greasy English breakfast of eggs and sausages.

On the previous evenings, they seemed more interested in competing with each other on who does the best imitation of Michael Caine, Liam Neeson or Sean Connery that in the modern concoctions the maitre d' brings to them.

Their friendship, they deny, holds the film together. Steve, still single, keeps getting girls to share his bed. Rob, who is married and have a baby, misses his wife and confronts Steve on his, to him, childish behavior.

The Trip was filmed as a six-episode faux documentary TV series, then cut to fit into a movie. I wish they'd show the series in the States for I would love spending more time with these unlikely friends who kept me laughing to the end.",1345507200,,1670,4.666666666666667

What comes next is an endless conversation between two men somewhat stuck together about anything and everything, sometimes impossibly hilarious, other times heartbreakingly honest.

The movie is still sublime as ever, and there are quite a few deleted scenes or early takes on the special features, but it strategically resists some of the funniest bits from the miniseries. ""The Trip"" is a funny, sweet, clever, and charming movie where Coogan and Bryden seem to be having a ball playing themselves. I actually prefer the movie cut to the miniseries (mainly because Bryden doesn't try to cheat on his wife in the movie. I liked him so much before that moment), but some of the impressions that were removed to get the time down are missed greatly. Oh well.",1338249600,2,812,4.493243243243243
4665051,5,B005E7SEM0,"The Trip is a lot like Sideways in that it features two men on a journey together, ostensibly a wine tour, or in this case, to review posh restaurants, but what both films are really about is two men facing down their respective mid life crisises with plenty of time to talk about it while on the road. That is what The Trip is about, at least the subtext--the sideways trip.

Now that I have compared and contrasted these two films, I am required by law to rate them, so The Trip isn't as brilliant as Sideways, but it is brilliant in its own way. The Trip is actually culled from a television program, so you could say it is like a made-for-TV movie--but at least it was British television.  It actually seems more like a documentary, or even real life. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon play fictional versions of themselves that share some of the same curriculum vitae.

Steve: Death is but a moment... Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction.

The two actually began playing slightly fictionalized versions of themselves in Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story. That was about the difficulty of getting a literary work of Tristam Shandy's magnitude on film, but it showed the comic possibilities of pairing Coogan and Brydon. Brydon is exactly the kind of person that would drive a pompous egomaniac like Coogan bonkers. In Britain, he is actually better known than Coogan, but his success rests on a totally frivolous comedy bit where he impersonates the voice of a tiny man stuck in a box. That, and silly impersonations of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Al Pacino, and Woody Allen. Steve Coogan's disdain for such frivolity is only equaled by his competitiveness and need to try and prove that he can do them better:

Steve, Rob: Come, come, Mr. Bond, you derive as much pleasure from killing as I do.

The dueling Michael Caine impersonations are kind of a running gag. Repeated ad infinitum, the sheer redundancy becomes the joke. It culminates in a visit to Bolton Abbey, an historical site that inspired Wordsworth to write The White Doe of Rylstone. When Brydan memorizes said verse, partly to intimidate Coogan, he is compelled to recite it in the voice of Ian McKellan, because he is from Bolton. Never mind that the Bolton Ian is from is a neighborhood near Manchester, with little or no connection to Bolton Abbey. This really sticks in Coogan's craw.

I know on paper and in this review you might be thinking that this kind of humor is a trifle too dry for your taste, but it's funny. Trust me. Along with the laughs there are many insightful lessons about life and things that really matter.

The Bottom Line is that The Trip is well worth taking. It is a delightful excursion that provides plenty of laughs along the way.

The two swop impressions of Michael Caine and Brydon, who is a brilliant impressionist, adds a bevvy of others including a hilarious Hugh Grants. They also quote poetry, declaim imaginary mock Shakespeare scenes and aim little barbed insults at each other. One of the subtle themes of the movie is the nature of their passive-aggressive friendship which is tinged with a kind of corrosive competitiveness.

The setup is that Coogan was supposed to have made the trip with his American girlfriend, who decided they needed a break in the relationship and went off back to the States. We see her from time to time in snatched phone calls. Brydon's domestic setup seems better --he has a loving wife and small baby.

The scenery in this late winter trip (the snow is just melting) is lovely and one of the running jokes, delivered deadpan like all the others, is the utterly pretentious food they eat. Scallops are on every menu and lots of the dishes come accompanied by unbelievably fanciful sauces and foams.

I can imagine the two of them trading barbs on the synergy of their greater selves, just as they tackled so many topics during their trip from childhood traumas to Wine.

Besides Coogan's (and Brydon's) banter, there's great scenes of Northern England and a great soundtrack (mostly) by Michael Nyman. There are no new Nyman tunes, but the ones they use are wonderful. I've heard from a friend and the other postings for this movie that the commentary and other scenes are just as good so I think I'll be getting the DVD to watch those.

This film is something of a people-watcher's goldmine. Very tightly composed, it nevertheless gives one the sense of a natural rhythm. There are several laugh-out-loud moments and equally enough geeky, goofy, awkward and sad moments to make the film reflective of life.

The leads are pleasant. Although there are a few expletives, they are scant and natural. They don't reduce the likability of either of the main characters. The theme is subtle, just as the theme of one's life usually would be. As subtle as the theme are the character's varying joy and disappointment. The two actors are average men, insecure, grounded, flailing, fulfilled...

laugh. sigh. wonder. when does success equal failure?

In short, the film could be characterized as a re-worked, natural progression on the French Nouvelle Vague documentary format.

I haven't seen the six-part tv series this was edited from, but the movie itself is a very dry and funny slice of British humor. Both Coogan and Brydon are good for a laugh a minute, or more like four a minute, and their chemistry makes this film. Although they're meant to be at odds a lot, you can see them each almost cracking up much of the time. They each do great voices, and the famous Caine scene is sweet indeed but the ""rise in the morning"" bit is the real highlight here, a truly fine bit that can stand proudly alongside the best of Python, The Office, Fawlty Towers and other Brit classics.

The side plot of Steve being a sad yet randy actor on the make is quite entertaining, and wondering where fiction stops and reality starts is some of the fun here. Hearing so many fine voices and bits of poetry and film quotes is another, as are the brilliant shots of the northern British countryside. This makes a fine travel ad for the area.

But the weirdest part of this film is all the food porn! Looong, loving shots of glistening scallops being seared to perfection and then fluffy foam being gently ladled on top of the juicy bit of fish, along with bits of watercress and powdered unicorn horn. It kind of distracts from the comedy but as jarring cuts go it's a delicious one. If you weren't hungry before watching this film you will be by the time it's over!

To top off all this fun, the dvd has a nice 12-min making of doc, and a wonderful set of ""deleted scenes"" that must be from the tv show, as there are over 100 minutes of them, and some of them are as good as most of what's in the film. Certainly well worth watching. Plus another 13 minutes of all the food porn collected into one long mouth-watering run of very fine looking gourmet chow.

All in all, a fine film. If you like good food, British humor, lovely countryside, and just underplayed sardonic laughter in general, this Trip is well worth taking.",1329523200,,1943,4.341597796143251

Coogan has a real talent for understanding what makes a jerk so funny, but he's not funny in this, he's just a jerk. By the end of this film Brydon perfects the art of being irritating. I read the negative reviews here and gave this film a chance on the strength of Coogan's past work, but I was disappointed. The film is overly long. While there are great panning shots of the English landscape, this was filmed it looks like at the end of winter. The landscapes are bleached and dreary, like the movie. Check it out if you're a Coogan fan, but don't be afraid to hit the stop button and give up, cause it doesn't improve.",1329264000,6,1557,6.707920792079208

Anyway I enjoyed the idea of watching people in England go on a true road trip. However, the scenery/countryside is the bleakest most depressing scenery I have seen in a very long time. And when they started mentioning the English literary settings . . . I could just imagine Tess of the D'urbvilles rounding one of those roads or Moll Flanders lurking around one of those buildings. Or Hardy's Jude walking from one of those towns to the other. Yuck. And when the guy said that the one day was perfect as the sun was shining (among other things) I was like yeah . . . right . . . it was not only plain barren looking land but gloomy. And the characters were supposed to be funny and while not depressing they rarely if ever smiled. When they did their entire faces lit up and they looked like different people. And the one guy would not stop doing impressions. Enough already. With them talking about themselves and their ""careers"" so much I thought I was watching Regis and Kathy Lee Live! back in the 90s. Usually B-listers as they are called do that sorta thing and milk every morsel for more than it is worth. And it is no wonder I have never heard of these two before. And in England are there really all these fancy restaurants and hotels in the middle of a ""village"" of 3 buildings in the middle of no where spaced out like that?

4665070,1,B005E7SEM0,"Living in Canada and not having a television, I do not know the Rob and Steve in this movie.  Before I 'google' them I will give an unprepared response to watching THE TRIP.

I am still not sure quite what roles they played.  I got the impression that one or both of them are professional impersonators and/or television actors.  If that is so, and they are playing themselves, that makes the movie a kind of humorous documentary about them.  But then the set-up is fictional --- clearly they are not really doing restaurant reviews, as they took no interest and made virtualy no comment about the food.  So what exactly is this movie?  I saw no moral stance from the director/writer.  That is, the unrelenting self-serving, mutual-admiration, boys-club spiel went on and on, without the audience being told that they were behaving like jerks.  Not implicit and not explicit.
The women in the movie were directed to be self-effacing and giggly-admiring --- so no criticism there either.  The two men, with their droopy smiles, come across in body language and in speech like two private-school boys who have not quite grown up. They have no interest in the world or other people or in each other except as sounding boards for their own desperate wit.  Is that what they were scripted / directed to do, and if so, where is the movie denouement?  A lonely Steve and a family-man Rob at the end do not suffice as a 'message', if that ending was so intended. Perhaps the movie was a satire on expensive self-indulgent television programming  -- the expensive vehicle, meals, hotels, a professional photographer travelling across the UK to take half a dozen snapshots of Steve.

So, I am baffled and frustrated.  The closest 'similarity' in movie making is the brilliant classic MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, which despite being 99% talking heads in a static restaurant, was enthralling.
I just wish I knew what Winterbottom was doing in THE TRIP.  I accept that perhaps it was made for a UK television-familiar audience who would find some common ground with what's on the screen.  I did laugh out loud in one brief scene.  After about 15 minutes I began to hate the two men, but I think NOT because Winterbottom was painting them to be hated.

Sadly, it's a mess. The supposedly witty repartee consists of the duo doing stupid impressions and the movie quickly loses any charm it began with as the director openly mocks the restaurants and their elaborate cuisine.

The DVD has a fun feature that showed each meal being prepared, along with all the foodie ingredients.

The Trip can be likened to Sideways, but without all the angst.  The film was mostly improvised and is slowly paced, so it won't be for every taste.

When Steve Coogan first accepts the journalism job, he imagines it as a perfect getaway with his pretty girlfriend.

These two real friends -- yes, the two gifted actors and funnymen are actual rivals of a sort, as are all actors -- embark on a road trip that allows them to riff on all kinds of things from fame to fatherhood to food.  But it's the incredibly sublime impersonations that charge this slightly unhinged duo's increasingly intense arguments over -- of all things -- the proper vocalization of Michael Caine's inimitable and distinctive voice.  What makes it deliriously funny is both Coogan and Brydon will not let go of the one-upmanship or the criticism of the other's Caine impression.  The dissect changing vocal minutia during different aspects of Caine's career -- and then each man offers ever more hilariously accurate intonations of Caine's shifting tones and accents in various vintage and recent films.

4665085,4,B005E7SEM0,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --Adapted from a 6-episode BBC2 series of the same name for exhibition in theaters, I was worried that The Trip would be muddled and confusing. For those who watched the series, I guess it still might be, but the film version is still a charming and amusing road trip. The combination of travel, food porn, and droll conversation works extremely well. Slowly paced and with nearly entirely improvised dialog, the film feels almost like non-fiction. Without the dream sequences that occasionally get thrown in, you could almost mistake it for documentary. Plot is nearly non-existent and the narrative drive almost totally comes down to moving on to the next locale in the morning, but it works. At most, we get some conversations between Coogan and his girlfriend and a couple of successful attempts of his to seduce desk clerks and the like, but none of that is really as important as the experience of the travel, which the two actors represent very well.

Nearly all of the success lies at the feet of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, who have a clear chemistry from their times together before. Anybody who has taken a road trip with a dubious companion can easily understand the acidic relationship between the car mates. They certainly have a history together and, in a sense, are definitely friends, but they spend so much time irritating each other with impersonations and undercutting the other's successes that the friendship is hard to see sometimes. But it sits under the surface and, as they sit in the car or the restaurant riffing on Michael Caine's progressively shifting accent, you can see it bubble up. Their reactions seem as natural in the scene as my own watching it; an especially funny line from Brydon makes Coogan crack up as much as it does me. I appreciate the authenticity of it and really enjoyed their dialog, even if the film is dramatically stunted.

Michael Winterbottom's direction is very solid, as well. He has a good sense of pacing, never lingering too long in the car or on a plate of food. Between location and travel footage, close up shots of high-end cuisine, and long dialogs between the actors, there's a lot for him to get to, but he covers everything in a satisfying way. After seeing the film, I wonder if the series would feel tedious and overlong, but that's for another time. This is a quiet film without much that will be overly exciting, but is an intelligent and witty time that will be easy and fun to revisit.

From MTI and IFC Films, the disc for The Trip is very good. I'd like to see it on Blu-ray, though, because while the image is acceptable, it's a little soft. The landscapes are gorgeous and I'd love to see them in better detail than we find here. The colors look natural and very nice, but the backgrounds just don't have the definition I was looking for. The sound is average and nothing special. The dialog is all perfectly clear and the music from Michael Nyman (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover) comes through pretty well. Almost nothing is done in the surround channels, though, bringing the sum total down a little bit. It's the slate of extras where the disc shines. For those bemoaning the edit of the show into the film, the deleted scenes should satisfy them a little bit. Having never seen the series, I have to assume that the more than a hundred minutes of deleted scenes encompasses much of the series, which featured six half-hour episodes. The time comes out pretty close, at least, though the disc never advertises them as such. They are not in episode form, so come off a little disjointed, but the footage is there. The disc continues with a short piece detailing the meals that the duo eats during their travels. It's pure food porn, but the food looks nice and tasty, so I can't complain. A short making-of featurette, a bit with a few photos and some climbing footage, a trailer, and a poster gallery round out the disc.

What makes the movie work is that the one-upsmanship comedy sequences aren't merely just excess, but it is often used as deflection, or to make a point, or to express a feeling. There's a definite tone of wistfulness, of middle-aged ennui, which makes the movie work as much more than a sum of comedy bits and impressions.

4665090,4,B005E7SEM0,"I suppose the best way to describe this is that it's comedic Spinal Tap meets Monty Python, meets travelogue..

Steve Coogan reminds me a little of Eric Idle, of Monty Python. I had been watching the ads for this movie on my cable on demand, and liked the Michael Caine bits that he and Rob Brydon did, and it was showing at a local theater so i decided to go.

So, Steve Coogan gets offered an opportunity to travel all over northern England, for the Observer, and write a critique about certain restaurants. His girlfriend and he are on hiatus, so as a second choice, he asks friend and well known Welsh impersonator Rob Brydon to tag along.

I am fairly familiar with Coogan from various movies over here, and totally unfamiliar with Brydon, who is a latter day Mike Yarwood. Although the premise does not sound particularly promising, I totally adored the way these characters played off each other.

There were some genius comics sparks that kept me laughing throughout, and not just me, the semi full theater laughed along with it too.

It's difficult to know where Steve Coogan the character, and Steve Coogan the person begins and ends, but I loved the many many excellent bits in this movie, where they do round robin impersonations, such as Caine, Connery, Schwarzenegger, Woody Allen, and one or two I did not recognise. There were other scenes with other characters, and I loved the narcissistic understated twist of Coogan's character. I really hope we will see more of him. I will say though that sometimes he comes across like Russell Brand's slightly depressed young uncle. I get the sense that much of this was improvised, and I love spontaneity, just watching two creative people go at it.

Rob Brydon who I had not heard of before, and who clearly appears to be friends with Coogan in real life, impressed me greatly, and I liked his Hugh Grant impersonation, Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton and his Little Man in a box routine.

While watching this movie I was distracted by a leggy blond sitting two seats over, and she had a boyfriend. Darn.

My favorite line apart from the one at the top of this review:

""Don't come running to me with your broken leg.""

So, if you like British humor, which can be quite subtle and understated, and more nuanced than what you get in American comedy, I think you will love this as much as I do.

4665091,5,B005E7SEM0,"Michael Winterbottom, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon reunited five years after their previous collaboration, Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story, to make this very enjoyable six part series for the BBC.  Each episode is under half an hour.  The series was reedited into a feature length film.  I've seen both but saw the series first.  They're both good but you probably only need to see one.  I'd chose the series because it's looser and allows you to savour the experience of watching it for longer.  The film works very well too and my only slightly decreased enjoyment of it was probably just due to the fact that I'd seen all the scenes before.

There isn't much of a plot as the focus here is on tone.  The Steve Coogan character calls Rob Brydon and asks him to accompany him to the north of England to sample some of the finest restaurants in the area with the intention of writing about the experience for an article for The Observer.  The original plan had been for Coogan to make the trip with his girlfriend (the real ""foodie"" of the couple) but she took a job in the U.S. as their relationship became strained.  The series follows the two actors eating at various restaurants (one per episode) while trying to outdo each other with impersonations of famous actors and exchanging stories/thoughts about their lives. Interspersed through these scenes are Coogan's attempts at connecting with his girlfriend via telephone as he walks about the beautiful landscape (usually at dusk).  As noted by the other reviewer it's a subtle film.  The humour is low key and there is a recurring feeling of melancholy as the Coogan character struggles to cope with his obvious unhappiness.  The acting, cinematography, writing and direction are all top notch.

The series/film reminded me of the great British film ""Withnail and I.""  Both are about a couple of self-absorbed actors who leave London for the country seeking some rejuvenation.  The dynamics between the characters are similar too as they constantly jab at each other.  The Withnail/Steve Coogan characters are a bit more self-absorbed while the Marwick or I/Rob Brydon characters are a bit more grounded.  The comedy, entertaining though it is, in both cases is also just a veneer for something darker.  It's perhaps noteworthy that both films reference the ""what a piece of work is a man"" soliloquy from Hamlet to emphasize the discontentment and sense of failure felt by the main characters. Unlike the older film, the characters in The Trip are not heavy substance abusers (there is substance use but nothing compared to the levels in Withnail and I). Interestingly one of the characters quips at one point something to the effect, ""I celebrated my 20th birthday with alcohol, my 30th with drugs and my 40th with food.""

In a sense The Trip is a glimpse of how the characters portrayed in Withnail and I might appear in middle age in current times.  Fans of the older film will undoubtedly find much to appreciate in this series but it's appeal shouldn't be limited to this group.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.",1312934400,3,3088,4.819734345351043
