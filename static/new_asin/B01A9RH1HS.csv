Easily the best viewing experience I've paid for on Amazon!",1529366400,,293,5.104166666666667

Dyke Hard is a band made from misfits. The lead singer opts out of the band and frames the rest of the band for murder. The film ends with a battle of the bands.

The movie is campy with bad musical numbers.
