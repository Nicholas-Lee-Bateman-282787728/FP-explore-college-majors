1221608,4,B00000IBMD,A fine WW1 romantic drama of Hemingway's novel.  Sincere performance from Rock Hudson as American officer in the crumbling Italian Army. Film a tad dated yet strangely p.c. and modern regarding Jennifer Jones' unwed mum-to-be.  Worth watching.,1186790400,3,243,5.54054054054054
1221609,5,B00000IBMD,It is an excellent movie.  I've always enjoyed it from the day it was released.,1185321600,2,79,4.266666666666667
1221610,2,B00000IBMD,"Already in the beginning you get the sense that this is a turkey. Selznick even repeats the same type of openingcredits as he did in GONE WITH THE WIND....

In the beginning, Jennifer Jones in particular is painfully amateurish but she is never helped by a wooden dialogue and screenplay...No one in this film is....

Even my mama at the age of 71 declared; ""what a 50s film""....  She has never uttered such phrases, but it is impossible not to agree...

Never for a moment do you leave the feeling that this a a movieset and even the musical score screams plagiate... in the beginning that is...

A shame really... The looks of Rock Hudson and the Elaine Stritch/Mercedes MacCambridge duo is the only thing worth watching with some of the scenary...

But THAT is only the beginning... midthrough ""soemthing"" happens at the characters and the film comes alive...

Miss Barkley is a clinging woman because of bad experience and I musy say that the dialogue and childbirth wasn`t common place in the movies in 1957.

The last half is good, but the overall impression is uneven...

1221611,4,B00000IBMD,"I saw this film years ago and was curious to see if it is still worth seeing after 50 years. The movie is beautifully filmed; the panoramic views are spectacular. The evacuation of the Italian Army is extremely well done. Rock Hudson as Lt. Frederick Henry, an American ambulance driver in World War I, proves that he can act in addition to being extremely handsome. He is by far the best thing about the movie. Jennifer Jones does not fair as well. One suspects that she may have gotten the part of Catherine Barkley, an English nurse, because she was married to the producer David O. Selznick of GONE WITH THE WIND fame. She says ""darling"" way, way too many times. Then there are the 50's censors to deal with. Catherine would never say she was ""pregnant,"" but rather is going to have a baby. Had she not informed us of that, we couldn't have been sure that she and Henry actually went to bed together as she's always buttoned up to her neck in her nurse's uniform although Mr. Hudson does take his shirt off from time to time.

I'm not sure how much of this story is really Hemingway's as the movie gets a bit preachy in the end. Henry keeps talking about that he has been bad. I do not know what he has done that is so wrong. Certainly fleeing from a military court martial where he would have certainly been shot is not a bad thing to have done.

The DVD version has some black and white footage of the premiere of the movie, along with a clip of PHOTOPLAY awards connected with it-- certainly interesting from a historical standpoint.

This is a story that is ripe for a remake. Hemingway's love story is worth repeating.",1144540800,12,1627,4.398671096345515
1221612,3,B00000IBMD,"The 1957 version of A Farewell to Arms is a mixture of the best and worst of David O. Selznick. On the plus side is the no expense spared lavishness of the whole production, with great Italian locations, great production design, a good supporting cast (including an excellent Vittorio de Sica, Alberto Sordi and Elaine Stritch) and a cast of thousands. On the debit side, there's some hokey love scenes and the miscasting of Selznick's private leading lady Jennifer Jones, lisping her way through an awkward British accent while seemingly impersonating a rather large bunny rabbit that somehow got a job as a nurse.

Charles Vidor lacks Frank Borzage's sensual romanticism, but despite some surprisingly clumsy comedy, Ben Hecht's script is much darker and more mature than you'd expect, with the grim retreat sequences and their aftermath far darker than anything in the Gary Cooper version. That said, the gay subtext to Rinaldi's friendship is almost completely absent, something that seems all the more noticeable with Rock Hudson playing the object of his affections (but that's hindsight for you). It's never particularly moving, but it's entertaining storytelling and it looks great in its original CinemaScope ratio.

Extras are limited to the original trailer and brief newsreel extracts.",1140912000,8,1297,5.260869565217392
1221613,3,B00000IBMD,"There is no question that David O. Selznick was one of Hollywood's greatest producers - anyone can look at his list credits and see that he was responsible for some of the most memorable films to come out of Hollywood.  Following his magnum opus, ""Gone With The Wind"" in 1939, however, Selznick kept trying to out-do himself, striving to create yet another great film on an epic scale. He did make some wonderful movies following ""GWTW"" (""Rebecca,"" ""Since You Went Away,"" ""Portrait of Jennie"") but many of them (like ""Since You Went Away"" and ""Duel In The Sun"") were hurt by his attempts at over producing.

""A Farewell To Arms,"" which was sadly Selznick's last film, is the prime example of Selznick at his worse - attempting to make a simple war love story into an epic production. The sweeping title credits racing across the screen (just like in ""Gone With The Wind"") should serve as a warning. While the production is an attractive one (exquisite wide-screen cinematography, beautiful locations, lovely score, etc.), it is not enough to warrant a grand scale for such a simple story. Rock Hudson is simply gorgeous in this film - he had to have been at his peak here. Jennifer Jones, as the love interest, doesn't fare as well. She is a beautiful and talented actress and one of the most interesting women to grace the screen, but she is miscast here. At 36, she is too mature to be playing Hudson's love interest (she is in her young 20s in the book) and their scenes together lack chemistry. The film also suffers from being overlong and padded with scenes that could have been easily left out. Thus we get 30 minutes of lovey-dovey between Jones and Hudson in the Swiss Alps followed by a birth scene that seems to go on forever.

That said, the film does look great on dvd and this is certainly the way to watch it. The extras include 3 Fox Movietone Reels - 1) """"A Farewell to Arms"" Premiere"" showing Selznick, Jones and Hudson, the producers and their wives, and Mercedes McCambridge, waving to the cameras,  2) ""Photoplay Awards"" showing Rock Hudson accepting his award for Favorite Actor, and  3) ""Meg at the Premiere of `A Farewell to Arms',"" which shows Princess Margaret attending the premiere. The theatrical trailer is also included.",1120435200,16,2251,4.7030456852791875
1221614,2,B00000IBMD,"When David O. Selznick undertook to remake ""A Farewell to Arms"" he was hoping to top Gone With the Wind.  Needless to say, every movie he made after GWTW would be compared to it and deemed inferior.  Most of his films have merit.  However, ""A Farewell to Arms"" is a bona-fide disaster on most counts.  David O. Selznick, who broke up Jennifer Jones and Robert Walker, was only concerned with Jones and her portrayal.  Unfortunately, Jennifer Jones with her distracting facial contortions (which the director should have kept in check) is terrible in this film right down to the last reel where we have to endure an interminable child birth scene and her subsequent death.  ""A Farewell to Arms"" could have been a superb film.  Instead, it is an overlong, talky, mishmash of romanticism between two characters who are portrayed by good actors who have no chemistry between them.  Hudson was perfect.  He did the best he could under less than ideal circumstances.  But Jones is the flaw in this film.  A fine actress if directed properly and that twisted mouth and deep voice inflection distracting kept in check, Jones is horribly miscast.  At the age of 38 she is certainly too old to be playing Catherine, a 23 year old nurse.  She is supposed to be british but her playing is stilted and forced, not to mention over-intense.  Even the musical score is unmemorable.  No wonder this film failed at the box office.  And no wonder David O. Selznick never made another film.  He was an anachronism by this time.  Skip this one folks unless you are a die hard JOnes and Hudson fan.  I recommend ""Song of Bernadette"", ""Portait of Jennie"" or ""Love Letters"" if you want to see Jones at her best!",1107648000,30,1687,4.657627118644068
1221615,4,B00000IBMD,"This was ""GONE WITH THE WIND""'s producer David O. Selznick's last movie.  This awful pan-and-scan VHS doesn't do it justice.  Sure, Jones and Hudson are too old for their roles, but it's a beautiful production, right down to the ""GONE WITH WIND""esque credits set against beautiful Italian locations and even the title ""A Farwell to Arms"" sweeps across the screen like in GWTW.  Come on, Fox, you've done us well with your ""Classics Collection"" in 2004; let's do the same for 1957's ""A Farewell to Arms.""",1104364800,7,503,4.825581395348837
1221616,2,B00000IBMD,"...Hemingway would have nothing to do with this adaption from his novel but the main criticism levied at Selznick is his wife at 38 was too old to play a young British nurse in Italy during WW1 opposite Rock Hudson as the American male nurse. The landscape and battle scenes were good but he was not being realistic casting his wife in this role. Selznick was still lookong for a sequel to ""Gone with the Wind"" which he had previously just failed with in ""Duel in the Sun"", but this film drags and the birth scene despite edits, remains too long. So much of the plot seems to have been truncated and reduced to a mere orthodox love story so there is not enough in the plot to sustain the time it runs. Incidentally the year ""1932"" that hangs as a title above is incorrect. This filmed version was made in 1957. I believe the Gary Cooper version was made in 1932 and in B&W not in colour as here.",1014249600,10,895,4.270588235294118

I did not purchase for J.Jones.  It was Hudson.  But instead of tearing it apart as some did, I sit back and enjoy it.  I agree she was mis-cast but 99% of the movies are mis-cast.

1221733,4,B00000IBMD,"there is always something about a movie that is appealing to me.  a film can be broken into several components be it the cast itself, or the way the leading actors relate to each other, or perhaps the films continuity. There may be a telling performance by a minor character.  it doesn't matter if  a film  may be slammed by critics or by the general public, if  I have discovered that if there is anything about a film that I can get my teeth into, I will enjoy it

this 1957 version of  A Farewell to Arms is such  a film.  No matter how it's slammed, I  will enjoy it.  I've seen it several times.  Maybe it's the doomed Major, or the American's flight with his pregnant English Nurse across the stormy Lake Como to imagined freedom in Switzerland, or the Swiss doctors constant assurances that ""all will be well"" during the nurse's delivery of a child, when  something, perhaps the background music or the worried expressions of doubt on the part of the expectant father, I am drawn back to this film.  it doesn't matter  just what it is,  A Farewell to Arms is a film I enjoy.

I hope others will  ""get"" the same type of enjoyment as well.  A movie  doesn't  have to be  some type of ""masterpiece"" for us to enjoy.  Enjoyment is enough.  There are many ""masterpieces"", but the bulk of films produced will not  fall in to this category.  all that is needed is something in a film for you to enjoy.  It .may be different reasons for each of us.  If a movie ""says something"", then it is sufficent",1391558400,2,1498,4.329710144927536
1221734,5,B00000IBMD,I saw this as a young teen in theater in 1957 and thought great acting on part of Jennifer Jones and Rock Hudson--a real tearjerker faithful to the book. Ernest Hemingway (Muriel the actresses's grandfather) wrote the story based on his adventures during his military service of WWI.,1387670400,,283,4.916666666666667
1221735,5,B00000IBMD,"Wow!  What a movie!  I've never heard of it before nor have I ever read the book it's based on.  I am so glad that I took a gamble & bought this from Amazon to add to my new Old Hollywood DVD collection!

I wanted to read other reviews before deciding to post one of my own. I wanted to see if anyone else had a similar issue to the film that I did.  I thought that Rock Hudson was brilliant in this movie. Though some say that there was no chemistry between he and the lead actress Jennifer Jones, I agree, but not for the same reason.

To me, Rock Hudson was there, on the mark, I felt the desire & love he had for her when he looked at her, when he spoke to her, when he would think about her or when he would talk about her to other characters.  But on the flip side, for me, it was the actress that didn't deliver the chemistry. Though I am not familiar with her or any of her work, this is the only film I have seen her in. I didn't feel that she delivered the chemistry or the screen presence that the story called for.

That aside, story wise, I loved it, heck, I even cried & I didn't see that coming lol. :D And the locations where they filmed are magnificent! Polarizing! So breathtakingly beautiful!!

I don't know if this would have been a better casting choice for this particular picture but I would have loved to have seen Esther Williams in this with Rock Hudson.  Maybe it was the scene on the lake in the row boat that made me think of her. :D  I think one of the biggest missed opportunities is that Esther Williams & Rock Hudson never worked and made films together!!  With their beauty & talent & style of acting, Esther Williams and Rock Hudson would have been a phenomenal pairing on screen!!",1378512000,3,1716,4.135542168674699
1221736,3,B00000IBMD,Plan to read the book soon and compare the movie to the book.  I saw this movie years ago but had forgotten the story line.  Do not like J. Jones acting.  Movie was okay but not great.,1375142400,,184,3.918918918918919
1221737,2,B00000IBMD,"1) Rock Hudson is like a talentless Cary Grant.  He was extremely good looking and possessed buckets of charisma and charm and yet he couldn't sell a single second of his performance.  He tries really hard, but he always comes across as just that; someone trying way too hard.  His chiseled features play too hard on the screen, never softening to express emotion and instead he feels almost as tightly wounds as Charlton Heston.

2) Jennifer Jones' mouth is scary.  It doesn't hurt that her performance is ridiculously melodramatic and almost disturbingly theatrical.  The way she alters her mouth to express sadness, madness, fear and passion is horribly unsettling.  I literally cringed 90% of the time she was on the screen.

3) The rain is a scary thing.  Sometimes you can see yourself dead in it.

4) Italian's are horny (I'm Italian, so I should have known this already...and I kind of did).  Vittorio De Sica was easily the film's saving grace and literally lit up the screen every time he was on it.  He blew the rest of the cast out of the water with his depth of character and ability to make the near absurdity of this prose feel full of weight it honestly didn't possess.  He broke up the uncomfortable nature of the dreadful love story by slicing through the over-seriousness of it all and giving the audience a reason to cheer.

5) This film may be stupid (really, so bad in concept, construction and casting) but it is beautiful to look at.  Each frame is a near piece of art, and the lighting is magnificent.  I'm really shocked that this film wasn't noticed by Oscar for its cinematography and score, but then again the fewer Oscar nominations the better for a film this bad.",1369785600,3,1694,4.634228187919463

1221761,3,B00000IBMD,"Shot in Cinemascope in DeLuxe color, David Selznick's version of the Hemingway classic is beautiful to look at in its use of Italian and Swiss locations - even though the First World War atmosphere seems a little unconvincing at times.  At 140 minutes, the film is way too long; its narrative becomes extremely slow, especially during the romantic scenes involving Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones.  As the British nurse Catherine Barkley, Jones seems a little too old for the role; but she acts extremely well, especially in the death-scene, when the light shines on her pallid face as she slowly passes away.  Rock Hudson provides an admirable foil, proving that he was a capable performer as well as a striking screen presence.

1221763,4,B00000IBMD,"This film is as underrated as the book is overrated.  Selznick was obviously trying to outproduce his own GONE WITH THE WIND, and as a production, I think he succeeded.  The location shooting alone (Cinemascope) is a real advance on the elaborate GWTW studio settings.  Seen on a large widescreen, the landscape scenes of northern Italy and Switzerland are second only to being there (and in 1957, they were breathtakingly beautiful).  The retreat of the Italian army was the perfect use of the new widescreen and Selznick exploited it fully.  The same can be said for the interiors, most of which were shot in actual palazzi which were in existence in 1918.  The same deluxe period feel was sought in the decor and costumes - with complete success.

The screenplay is credited to Ben Hecht, considered by many to be the finest writer of Hollywood's Golden Age.  As a cohesive narrative, the film holds together better than the vast majority of those made today.  Much of the dialogue is interesting.  Some of it (particularly the love scenes) is risible and dated.  But having just read the novel, I can tell you that nearly all of the dialogue came directly from the book.  So if there is any problem with the film, it is that the novel's questionable status as a classic seems to have inhibited the film makers.  If you giggle, blame ""Papa"" Hemingway.

That leaves the acting.  Hudson is his handsome, forthright self.  Jones gives a variable performance.  The early parts of the script gave her little to work with.  By the finale, she is giving her considerable all.  Her scrunched mouth (was she Rene Zellweger's mother?) was just part of her face and is evident in all her films. The supporting cast of De Sica, McCambridge and Stritch are all excellent.

All in all, the film is one of the most important Hollywood productions of the fifties.  If it's not a cinematic masterpiece (and neither is GWTW), we are still very fortunate to have it.",1286409600,11,1950,4.72700296735905

Hudson did his best, but the screenplay gave him nothing to work with, and how such a hunk could fall in love -- instantly or otherwise -- with the ditz that Jennifer Jones makes the heroine out to be is beyond any thinking person's comprehension. One has to suspend disbelief to imagine her as a nurse. Jones repeatedly twists her lips as if she has Bell's palsy or a mouth full of novocaine, and in general acts like a  teenager trying out different personalities to see which one fits her. Most of the time, she appears to need psychiatric help. When Hudson weeps over her dead body the tears may be real:  He's probably crying because he realizes what a gawdawful mistake he made by appearing in this horror that has to be one of the 10 worst ""A"" Pictures ever made.

Even if Hudson is your favorite actor (as he is mine), I think he'd be posthumously grateful to everyone who buries this one. In an unmarked grave.  Watch the Gary Cooper/Helen Hayes version instead.",1270684800,7,1074,4.459183673469388

Jennifer Jones at 38 is simply too old to play the heroine, who is supposed to be 23 or something. Hudson and Jones lack chemistry, and Hewingway's essence is nowhere to be found, this is a movie that was simply doomed. The Gary Cooper version is probably better. Selznick's decision to cast Jones was a fatal mistake. Don't bother to say hello to this movie, it might drain the spirit out of you, don't let the DVD cover of Hudson and Jones kissing fool you. This is a romance without any romantic elements, don't even compare this to ""Gone with the wind"", which is Selznick's calling card.",1269734400,,755,4.684210526315789

Well I have to admit that I have read Hemmingway but not this book. I did however see the Gary Cooper movie first.  However, it is a story about Love found - love lost - love found - love never lost.

This version seems a little fuller and a lot more colorful than the 1932 version. However, the story is also filled with slapstick comic relief and conversational filler tripe. This is still a tearjerker.  It has been suggested that Jennifer was a tad old for the part of a 23-year-old nurse. I was so busy with the story that I did not really notice.  As far as Rock, I thing he was thrown into lots of these movies on his hansom leading man reputation. Vittorio De Sica acted his part quite well; however, I keep seeing him as Cardinal Rinaldi in ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"" (1968.) See Dr. Emerich (Oscar Homolka) again in The Seven Year Itch (1955.)

7910396,3,B00000IBMD,"The movie successfully captures the outer trappings of the novel,.  A great love that can't quite survive the world tragedy in which it is embedded.  Each time our lovers seem to escape, the tragedy of war or sickness ropes them back in.  I love Jenifer Jones' nuanced performance, and I fall in love with her every time. The movie's fatal flaw is Rock Hudson's rendition of the male protagonist.  To put it bluntly, he plays the protagonist as an angry, selfish, self-pitying jerk.  So it's not believable that a sensitive soul would fall in love with him just for his good looks.  The relationship is deprived of reality, so the viewer can't vicariously jump into it.  What could have been a great movie must settle for being pleasant.",1506816000,,737,4.7109375

Gorgeous cinematography and highly professional treatment all around help a movie that's just a little too long.  It's actually more faithful to the novel than some might think, though it's nobody's idea of a subtle or profound movie.  It nonetheless proves a pleasure to many of us.",1495497600,3,364,4.950819672131147

7910400,1,B00000IBMD,"""A Farewell to Arms"" is a great novel by Hemingway. This movie version of it is dreadful. The script is plodding. The acting is wooden. A fortune must have been spent on the visuals of the war with their thousands of extras. However there is no tension;. there is no excitement in any part of this movie.",1486857600,,304,4.350877192982456
